    "[from [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3)], Modules are Python `.py` files that consist of Python code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module. A Python file called `hello.py` has the module name of `hello` that can be imported into other Python files or used on the Python command line interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can define functions, classes, and variables that you can reference in other Python `.py` files or via the Python command line interpreter. In Python, modules are accessed by using the `import` statement. When you do this, you execute the code of the module, keeping the scopes of the definitions so that your current file(s) can make use of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python imports a module called `hello` for example, the interpreter will first search for a built-in module called `hello`. If a built-in module is not found, the Python interpreter will then search for a file named `hello.py` in a list of directories that it receives from the `sys.path` variable."

The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the name of the function (`txt2dict`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`filenames`). The body of the function - the statements that are executed when it runs - is indented below the definition line. The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value."
