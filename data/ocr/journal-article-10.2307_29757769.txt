<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hirbemerdon Tepe A Middle Bronze Age Site in Northern Mesopotamia by Nicola Laneri In the Ancient Near East, the period elapsing between the end of the third and the beginning of the second millennia B.C. is defined as moment of dramatic transformation both from climatic and historical perspectives. This is particularly clear in northern Mesopotamia, that encompasses northeastern Syria, northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, where we witness a dramatic collapse of centralized political and economic systems based on large urban centers (Dalfes, Kukla &amp; Weiss 1997; Cooper 2006; Nichols &amp; Weber 2006). Although cultural continuity is evident at numerous sites during this chronological period (Abay 2007; Marro 2007), the results of these changes correspond to a reorganization of the regional settlement pattern that, at the beginning of the second millennium B.C., appears to be characterized by smaller sites and a higher degree of pastoral activities (Ristvet &amp; Weiss forthcoming). It is within this historical landscape that the recent archaeological rescue projects enacted in the region of the upper Tigris river valley in southeastern Turkey and part of the Ilisu Dam Rescue Project have brought some light to a period and a region that until recently have been considered as terra incognita (Algaze et al. 1991). Among these projects, the Hirbemerdon Tepe Archaeological Project has further elucidated the development of societal complexity in this region during the late third and early second millennia B.C. Moreover, aims of the project have been two-fold and focused on: 1) defining the development of socioeconomic organization within a rural area without large areas dedicated to agricultural activities as with the rest of Mesopotamia; and 2) understanding the role played by a middle-level settlement, as is Hirbemerdon Tepe, during the early second millennium B.C. It is in these directions that the present paper will deliver information regarding the results of the excavation at this site. The Architectural Complex of the Middle Bronze Age Since the beginning of the archaeological work at Hirbemerdon Tepe in 2003 (Laneri 2005 and 2006), it has been clear that the site was marked by material culture typical of the late third, such as the Dark Rimmed Orange Bowls (hereinafter DROB), and early second millennium BC, such as the Red Brown Wash Ware (hereinafter RBWW, Laneri et al. 2008 and forthcoming). Additionally, the RBWW appears also during the earlier third millennium phase of occupation at the site. This category of pottery represents a local tradition of the upper Tigris river valley and is characterized by a distinctive surface treatment based on a bichrome - 'red' to 'blackish' - colored slip that is the result of the oxygen reduction tu 365</page><page sequence="2">obtained in the firing chamber of the kiln during the firing process (Parker &amp; Swartz Dodd 2003;Laneriet al. 2008). The excavations carried out at the site have also demonstrated that whereas the late third millennium B.C. occupation is scattered and difficult to define architecturally, the levels of the early second millennium B.C. represent the most important phase of occupation both in the Outer Town and the High Mound, while the Lower Town most probably consisted of temporary settlements (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a brief sounding in the Outer Town has demonstrated that this area was used for working activities (Laneri et al. forthcoming). However, most of our efforts have concentrated on excavating the High Mound and especially a very well preserved large architectural complex chronologically ranging between c. 2000 and 1500 B.C. as demonstrated by a series of radiocarbon dates (Laneri et al. 2008). The architectural complex discovered at Hirbemerdon Tepe appears to be one of the most impressive architectural structures of the Middle Bronze Age period in the whole upper Tigris river valley. Spatial distribution and functional analyses of the different districts of the architectural complex reveal that the whole complex was differentiated into two main sectors: one central sector dedicated to more public activities, and another area, separated from the central one by a long alley and a large outdoor space (a piazza), that is marked by long, narrow buildings built in an agglutinated manner and showing clear signs of working activities, such as mortar, pestles, grinding stones and hydraulic facilities. The complex occupied the entire acropolis on the High Mound and was originally constructed using the natural bedrock and virgin soil as foundations and floors respectively (Laneri et al. 2006 and 2008). Walls were built using stone foundations with a superstructure of pise and/or mud-brick. Approximately 1000 sqm of its total extension have been uncovered since the beginning of its excavation (Fig. 2). The main alley was composed of a wide sidewalk (c. 1 m) and a deep canal (c. 1 m in width and 1 m deep), which was used in ancient times for draining the waters and as a place for discarding trash deposits. This assumption is based on the discovery of broken objects, such as decorated portable hearths, molds for the making of shaft-hole axes, elongated clay objects, and numerous animal bones in the canal. The alley leads to an open space (piazza), which had a raised path and an elliptically-shaped stone basin. The public sector is located east of the piazza and south of the main alley (Fig. 3). However, the piazza most probably had a ceremonial function and was associated with the public area as demonstrated by the presence of the basin and by the recovery of numerous objects (highly decorated ceramic vessels, human and animal clay figurines, and clay votive plaques) deposited here in ancient times and not recognizable in other buildings of the architectural complex. In addition, the decorated clay votive plaques were purposely broken and located nearby the basin. These objects are unique examples in the ancient Near Eastern tradition and are characterized by a central anthropomorphic or stick figure framed by a series of geometric elements (Fig. 4). These plaques have a flat and undecorated back side, a spout at the bottom suggesting possible libations, and a pierced square at the top presumably used for their attachment to the wall with a hook or peg. The combined decorative use of triangles and * dancing deer' in one of the vessels found in the outdoor space is also unique and has to be considered as an extraordinary find (Fig. 5). However, this type of decorative pattern can be linked to the tradition of Painted Ware typical of the Middle Bronze Age in eastern Anatolia (Qlingiroglu 1984; ?zfirat 2001). 366 [2]</page><page sequence="3">HIRBEMERDON TEPE 2008 ! 8 I ? i I t IJ J -I i I &gt;M ::i|glilllii N400 ?-? 1 N380 ?'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-?-'-1-' Z2_jtt-&gt;&lt;-X0?-U100flD&lt; 0 40 80 120 ? ?CAVATED AREAS _I_I Mete? | TO BE EXCAVATE AREAS Fig. 1 - Map of Hirbemerdon Tepe showing the excavation areas.</page><page sequence="4">1*T Fig. 2 - Map of the Middle Bronze Age architectural complex with the result of the geophysical survey. Next to the piazza lays a monumental building that has only one entrance from the main alley and is based on an antechamber and a series of rooms. Among these rooms, a long room appears as the most important one. It is directly accessible from the antechamber through a door that is in axis with the main door serving the whole building and is marked by a stone altar and two perpendicular drains located behind it. This room was monumental as is demonstrated by its size, the thickness of the outer walls and the large flagstones paving it. Moreover, a foundation deposit, consisting of a piglet inserted in a fine RBWW cup, was found in the northeastern corner of this room and further emphasize its importance (Laneri et al. 2008). Another rectangular room was found immediately next to this main long-room and had its entrance from a vestibule located next to the antechamber. This room was sealed by the collapse of the roof and a squared bench of stone foundation and mud-brick superstructure was discovered along one of the long walls. A small storage room near the outdoor piazza contained a stone bench and two niches probably used to store products contained inside ceramic vessels. Three storage rooms that contained stone benches, a high number of stone tools and storage jars were discovered to the east of this building. Due to a steep slope in the virgin soil, the public area was built using a terracing system and, as a consequence, outdoor spaces were used to chain together the whole sector. Thus, another outdoor space was created in ancient times to connect the previously described building to the uppermost one (Figs. 2 and 3). Because of later pits and of the slope, this building is poorly preserved and consists of a series of outdoor and indoor rooms and wide external walls. Due to its poor state of preservation, it is very difficult to reconstruct both the 368 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3 - The public sector of the architectural complex. function and the distinctive features of this building. However, its central location and monumentality both in plan and architecture together with an almost total lack of working tools suggests a public purpose for this sector. To further emphasis its monumentality, the western side was built on top of an extraordinary retaining construction consisting of a wide stone wall built next to a mud-brick substruction and a series of small rooms constructed in a casemate manner in order to connect this higher building to the piazza located at a lower level (i.e., 3 meters of difference in elevations are recognizable between the floors of the uppermost building and the piazza's floor) (Fig. 3). The rooms were accessible from the piazza and the monumentality of the whole facade should have been of primary importance in creating the urban landscape of the architectural complex. Moreover, in one of these rooms numerous whole and broken vessels were found, whereas the other one was filled with mid-sized stones and fragmented storage jars. The northern sector of the architectural complex consisted of a series of long, narrow buildings built using an agglutinated construction system. The buildings were divided by double walls, each with an entrance from the main alley and were contained by a long corridor that was discovered in patches along the northern edge of the sector. Many of the rooms in these buildings were too small to have served as domestic spaces, and the numerous ground stones and paleobotanical remains found within these structures point to their use as [51 369</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4 - One of the clay votive plaques found in the piazza of the architectural complex. Fig. 5 - A fragmented jar found in the piazza of the architectural complex decorated with triangles and 'dancing deer'. areas dedicated to working activities. The architectural layout of most of the buildings consisted of rooms for processing and smaller rooms for temporary storage. The central room paved with flagstones may have functioned as an open area providing light for the other rooms. The high density of seeds and the whole fruit of Vitts Vinifera (grape) in one room (room 27) is tantalizing evidence for the production of wine at the site (Fig. 6). Using textual and archaeological evidence, there seems to be an intriguing possibility that wine production was occur? ring at Hirbemerdon Tepe. In fact, texts of the early second millennium B.C. (Forlanini 2006) mention the use of trade routes running through the Tur Abdin and other regions in southeastern Anatolia (for example Carchemish and the upper Euphrates valley region, Balossi, Di Nocera &amp; Frangipane 2007) to obtain wine that was kept in the cellars of the most important palaces of the Mesopotamian city-states (e.g., Zimri-Lim of Mari, Durand 1997). Due to its quality, the wine produced using the Vitis vinifera of the Tigris and Euphrates regions was thus highly sought after by the kings of the Middle Bronze Age and was most probably an important commodity in the long-distance trade enacted between northern Mesopotamian merchants and Anatolian groups (Yener 2007; Barjamovic 2008). Within this perspective, the high density of seeds and the whole fruit of Vitis Vinifera found in room 27 can allow us to interpret this space as part of a productive unit dedicated to processing wine in association with a stone basin and a complex hydraulic system found within the room that served to store the produced wine and to clean the basin after processing the grapes through a drain directed towards the main alleyway. Similar features have also been found in other archaeological contexts of southeastern Turkey in the late third/early second millennia B.C. (e.g., Titri? H?y?k, Laneri 2007). In addition, perforated mortars with a hole in the bottom have been consistendy found in numerous rooms of the architectural complex and were probably utilized to process and filter the wine. According to preliminary studies (Mark Schwartz personal communication), these mortars may have been lined with cloth to serve as a funnel and filter for pressing grapes. The western part of this sector is secluded from the rest of the complex by a staircase on one side and also consisted of storage and food processing rooms. One large room in this 370 [6]</page><page sequence="7">sector was probably dedicated to cooking activities as confirmed by the presence of a large circular burnt feature and numerous cooking pots found in situ. More complex is the definition of a building to the west of the piazza and south of the western wing of the northern sector. This area contains large rooms and a few working features, suggesting that it might have functioned as a sort of connection between the working and the more ceremonial/public area of the architectural complex. In addition to these data, it is interesting to point out the preliminary results obtained from the faunal analysis. They indicate an economy based on a mixture of animal husbandry and hunting, with cattle sup? plying a significant proportion of meat. Pigs served as a steady supply of sustenance while sheep and goat may have been kept for secondary products. Hunting played a more important role than expected in this region during the Middle Bronze Age and the proportion of wild animals, Fig. 6 - A carbonized whole grape found in room 27. especially deer bones and anders, exceeds the percentages found in contemporaneous Mesopotamian sites. Conclusions One of the most intriguing aspects of the High Mound at Hirbemerdon Tepe is the presence of ritual artifacts spatially segregated from but lying next to storerooms associated with agricultural production and storage. In examining similar features at other archaeological sites both in the Near East and elsewhere, there are indications that this architectural layout was produced as a result of emerging elites utilizing the ideological system to secure their economic bases of power (Schwartz &amp; Falconer 1994). An increase in ritual activities has been seen associated with an increase in socio? political complexity in numerous archaeological contexts both in the Old and New World (Earle 1997). One of the closest parallels to this process is represented by middle-level sites of the early to-mid third millennium B.C. located in the Khabur region in northeastern Syria that show signs of some sort of central authorities, specialized activities and ceremonial areas. Among these sites, Tell Raqa'i appears as the best conserved and was almost entirely dedicated to large-scale grain storage and processing (Schwartz 1994). Despite its relatively small size, the community had a religious center. An interesting theory that was proposed by the archaeologists working at the site to explain this phenomenon suggests that the temple was [7] 371</page><page sequence="8">there to serve as ideological legitimization for the specialized activities at the site, whereby mobilization of surplus by elites was institutionalized in the form of religious rituals. The proximity of a monumental central area, that is marked by a large outdoor space (the piazza) and the presence of purposely scattered debris of ceremonial artifacts, to sectors dedicated to specialized working activities (i.e., processing and storage of food) at Hirbemerdon Tepe, suggests that the site may have witnessed a similar process to the one at Tell Raqa'i. An analysis of contemporaneous local Middle Bronze Age sites in the area of the upper Tigris river valley demonstrates that many of these small-to-medium sized sites shared several important aspects in common which include working and storing facilities, areas dedicated to ceremonial/public activities, and some forms of political centralization. The sites of ?ctepe (?zfirat 2006), Ziyaret Tepe (Matney &amp; Rainville 2005), Kenan Tepe (Parker &amp; Swartz Dodd 2003), Giricano (Schachner 2002), Kavu?an H?y?k III (K?zbe et al. 2004), Salat Tepe (?kse 2006; ?kse &amp; G?rm?? 2007), T?rbe H?y?k (Saglamtimur and Ozan 2007) and Hirbemerdon Tepe (Laneri 2005; Laneri, Schwartz &amp; Ur 2008; Laneri et al. 2006, 2008, and forthcoming) all had public buildings on high mound summits showing similar architectural features. According to Okse (2006) these sites, including Hirbemerdon Tepe, served the purpose of watching over agricultural lands from high promontories overlooking the tributaries, of storing agricultural surplus near monumental constructions and of utilizing the river to communicate with each other. This phenomenon of socioeconomic development probably initiated during the late third millennium B.C., but increased in form and density during the early second millennium B.C. when stronger contacts with exogenous groups coming from northern Mesopotamia, central and eastern Anatolia intensified, as is exemplified by the presence of morphological and decorative similarities in certain pottery categories (e.g., carenated shapes and vessels decorated with painted bands and triangles - the so-called Khabur Ware, Nigro 1998, Oguchi 1998). The importance of long-distance trade in the emergence of social complexity in Anatolia is demonstrated by both textual and archaeological data (Forlanini 2006; Yener 2007). In addition, a possible explanation for the contemporaneous presence of material culture and the almost total lack of architectural features dating to late third millennium B.C. at Hirbemerdon Tepe as well as at other sites in the region, can be related to a complete re-foundation of the settlements during the early second millennium B.C. through the construction of buildings that completely obliterated the earliest levels. Furthermore, rituals of foundation associated with these new constructions are clearly visible at Hirbemerdon Tepe (i.e., the remains of a piglet found in a cup in a long room of the ceremonial building), as well as at Salat Tepe, where three stone idols were found inside the mud-brick terrace constructed underneath the 'monumental building' (Okse &amp;G?rm?? 2007). In conclusion, the archaeological data in our possession suggest that the site of Hirbemerdon Tepe was strongly linked to other sites of the upper Tigris region through a system of social solidarity, as demonstrated by common shared cultural elements (such as the RBWW). However, during the early second millennium B.C. an increasing need for commodities (for example wine or copper) by other Mesopotamian and Anatolian groups brought about a new socioeconomic model in which middle-level settlements (Iannone &amp; Connell 2003) characterized by specialized activities, forms of centralization, and ceremonial areas, conquered the region's landscape and enhanced forms of social complexity typical of rural area like the upper Tigris region valley. 372 [8]</page><page sequence="9">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First of all, I would like to thank the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey for its support and the permit for archaeological work at Hirbemerdon Tepe since 2003.
