Traffic accidents are the cause of more than 50 per cent of these injuries. Fractures and dislocations of the vertebrae as well as minor spinal injuries can cause both acute and chronic pain or disability. Knowledge of the biomechanical response of the spine under static and dynamic loads would lead to a better understanding of the injury mechanisms and to improved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This information could also be useful to validate mechanical and mathematical models of the spine. In this over-view of the literature, biomechanical experimental methods and results for the lumbar spine under different loading conditions are presented and discussed. Numerous experimental studies on lumbar spine response and stability to static loads, especially in the physiological range of motion have been reported in the literature, both for flexion, extension, lateral bending, compression and torsion. Most experiments are made on a single motion segment, consisting of two adjacent vertebrae, the disc and the surrounding ligaments. A few studies have reported on the traumatic static, quasistatic and dynamic mechanical behaviour and the failure mechanisms of the lumbar spine, especially for flexion and compression. Some data is also available from dynamic loading of lumbar spine components (ligaments, bone, disc). Response and tolerance data for dynamic loads as well as for combined modes of impact are limited and the range of motion data are sparse. INTRODUCTION During the past decades the number of spinal injuries has increased. Traffic accidents are the cause of more than 50% of these injuries. The cost of fatal and non-fatal injuries is over $100 billion in the United States, and a large portion of that amount is attributed to spine-related injuries (Committee on Trauma Research). Serious and critical spinal injuries, including fractures and fracture dislocations, can lead to severe impairment of the nervous system. In Sweden severe spinal injuries occur in about 50 cases per year, per million inhabitants (Lundqvist, 1990; Socialstyrelsen, 1992). Spinal injuries leading to severe spinal cord injuries occur in about 10-15 cases per year and million inhabitants. About 15- 20 cases per million inhabitants and year are spinal injuries with minor neurological symptoms and most of these injuries are traffic or work related. In spite of the fact that these injuries occur rather frequently, little is known about the injury mechanisms. In car accidents, lap seat-belts can cause flexion-distraction injuries of the lower torso. Most of these injuries are localised to the upper region of the lumbar spine, and especially to the L3-L4 motion segment, resulting in anterior compression fractures, posterior tension fractures, fracture- dislocations, or Chance fractures (Chance, 1948; Smith and Kaufer, 1969; Steckler et al., 1969; Greenbaum et al., 1970; Dehner, 1971; Gertzbein and Court-Brown, 1988). These injuries seem to be due to extreme hyperflexion of the torso around the lap seat-belt which immobilises the hips. Some of these injuries are purely ligamentous and some consist of fractures or fracture dislocations of various elements of the spinal column. Yoganandan et al. (1989-a) reported that serious thoracolumbar injuries in frontal car crashes were mainly bone related (fractures and fracture dislocations, AIS* 3+). Flexion-distraction injuries 1271</page><page sequence="2">still account for about 6% of the severe injuries of the lumbar spine (Denis, 1983). During the 60's and early 70's lap seat-belt injuries were common, about 24% of all fatalities in motor vehicle accidents included these injuries (Nahum et al., 1968). A significant decrease in the number of lumbar spine injuries in frontal car accidents occurred when the shoulder belt was introduced. Today, lap seat-belts are found in the rear seat (mid-position) in private cars. Flexion fractures are also attributed to the fact that the shoulder belt is incorrectly worn (e.g. King 1984; Gertzbein and Court-Brown, 1988), and in lateral oblique car impacts to passengers on the non struck side (e.g. Hill et al., 1992). Gertzbein and Court-Brown (1988) have described the fracture patterns in 19 young patients with flexion- distraction injuries, where 15 of the patients had sustained their injuries because they were wearing solely lap belts, lap and shoulder belts, or misused the shoulder belts. However, the authors have not described the severity of the injuries in relation to the type of car accident or type of seat-belt used. Most experimental studies on lumbar spinal segments have been made under static loading in the physiological range of motion (Liu et al., 1975; Schultz et al., 1979; Panjabi et al., 1982). Only a few studies have described the failure mechanisms of the lumbar spine under large static loads (Lin et al., 1978; Adams and Hutton, 1982; Miller et al., 1986). In most of the studies pure loads have been applied in one direction. In real life, the loading situation is often represented by a combination of bending moment, shear force, and compression or tension. The difficulty lies in choosing an appropriate combination, because there is insufficient information about the loads in vivo (White and Panjabi, 1990). Burst and crush fractures of the thoracolumbar spine during dynamic compressive loading have been reported by, for example Willen et al. (1984),Fredrickson et al. (1988, 1992), Panjabi et al. (1994) and Shono et al. (1994). The response of the lumbar spine to dynamic loads in other directions than compression has not been studied in detail. Few, if any methods have been presented for dynamic (transient) traumatic loading of lumbar segments in flexion, extension, lateral bending and torsion, probably because of the difficulties in applying appropriate loads which would correspond well to the injury situation in real life. Further knowledge of the biomechanical response of the spine under traumatic static and dynamic (transient) loads, and of the stability of the injured spine would lead to a better understanding of the injury mechanisms and to improved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This information could also be useful to validate mechanical and mathematical models of the spine and could serve as a base for the development of preventive protection devices in order to reduce the risk for, and minimise the severity of spinal injuries, particular those caused by traffic accidents. A survey of the acquired knowledge and the needed information regarding injury mechanisms has been published in the United States by the Committee on Trauma Research (1985). For the thoracolumbar spine the vertebral fracture mechanisms are understood for vertical acceleration. The committee claims that response and tolerance data for combined modes of impact are extremely limited and the range of motion data are sparse. A clearer understanding of the deformations that cause injury to the spinal cord is needed. Assessment technology needs to be considerably improved, including the development of the means of assessing major spinal injuries, improvement of anthropomorphic dummies, and development of computer models to predict injury in complex crash situations. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE LUMBAR SPINE STATIC EXPERIMENTS - The mechanical response of the in vitro lumbar spine under normal static physiological loads in flexion, extension, lateral bending, compression and torsion have been reported on in detail in the literature, by for example Liu et al. (1975), Schultz et al. (1979), and Panjabi et al. (1982). The biomechanical response in vitro of the injured lumbar spine to normal static physiological loads has been studied by Panjabi et al. (1975), White et al. (1975), and Adams et al. (1980). These studies do not take into account the increasing dislocation of different structures of the spine during the injury phase, nor the fact that several different components of a spinal segment are strained simultaneously, all contributing to spinal segment instability. Only a few studies described the biomechanical response and failure mechanisms of the lumbar spine to large static and quasistatic loads which cause different kinds of trauma. Lin et al. (1978) determined the mechanical behaviour of FSUs subjected to both combined physiological loading in different directions as well as to failure loads. Their emphasis was on the role played by the posterior elements. Their results showed that the posterior elements transmitted considerable forces, particularly in extension and frontal shear. The failure loads for compression (combined with a shear force of 133 N) ranged from 1560-5800 N. Adams and Hutton (1982) studied disc prolapse under hyperflexion. The specimens were compressed (2-13 kN) when wedged in flexion just a few degrees above the physiological limit. The 1272</page><page sequence="3">modes of failure were disc prolapse or compressive or hyperflexion fracture. Posner et al. (1982) investigated sagittal plane displacement of lumbar FSUs exposed to large compressive forces (400-900 N) in combination with an anterior shear force between 300-560 N after sequential transection of the ligaments. In flexion loading, all posterior ligaments plus one anterior ligament had to be destroyed before complete failure occurred. However, the forces producing failure varied between specimens and were not presented. Miller et al. (1986) presented data describing the resistance of lumbar segments to large shear, bending and torsional loads (pure loads in one direction at the time) and how these resistances were related to the motions of the segment. Forces up to 980 N were applied in anterior shear and bending moments up to 69 Nm were applied in flexion. For these loads no rupture occurred. Osvalder et al. (1990) and Neumann et al. (1992) investigated the ultimate strength in flexion of the lumbar spine as well as the threshold of flexion- distraction injury has been determined for a combined load of bending moment and shear force. Complete rupture occurred in the specimens at a load of 156 Nm/620 N. The threshold of injury was reached at a load of 121 Nm/486 N. DYNAMIC EXPERIMENTS - The spine exposed to trauma will resist the load impact by way of different mechanisms, depending on the speed of the impact. Low speed trauma will engage the elastic stiffness properties of the tissues composing the spine while high speed trauma will activate the inertial and visco-elastic resistance of the tissues (Viano and Lau, 1988). Studies with cadavers have been carried out to establish tolerance levels for different parts of the spine during crash tests (e.g. Vulcan et al. 1970; Mertz and Patrick, 1971; Prasad et al., 1974; Mitai et al., 1978). Traumatic cervical spine injuries such as involved in motor vehicle collisions have been replicated using human cadaver cervical spines, see Pintar et al. (1989) and Yoganandan et al. (1990). The strain distribution over the cortical surface in a spinal segment during whole-body (compressive) impact acceleration was studied by Hakim and King (1977). They concluded that it is erroneous to correlate possible areas of vertebral fractures to findings from pure compressive loading since the bending moment plays an important role in the strain distribution. Very few studies on biomechanical response of the lumbar FSU under dynamic loading conditions have been reported in the literature so far. Cyclic dynamic compressive loading has been used to simulate repetitive stresses that cause fatigue failure of the lumbar spine during normal daily activities (Liu et al., 1983; Hansson et al., 1987). It has also been used to determine biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc (Koeller et al., 1984). Willen et al. (1984) used an instant axial compressive dynamic force in order to produce burst or crush fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. The results showed that crush fractures occurred at 8 kN and at 11 kN, the spinal cord was damaged. The response of the lumbar FSU to dynamic traumatic flexion loads of combined bending moment and shear force is presented by Osvalder (1992), Osvalder et al. (1993) and Neumann et al. (1994-b). The FSUs showed flexion-distraction injuries with different severity depending on the shape and the loading rate of the applied load pulse. The specimens resisted higher loads and absorbed more energy when the loading rate was high. Hayes (1983) showed that a bone sample which is very rapidly loaded has greater ultimate strength and absorbs more energy than a sample which is loaded more slowly. Carter and Hayes (1976) studied the influence of strain rate on bone compressive strength, and the influence of the loading rate on the mechanical properties of vertebral bone has been discussed by for example Panjabi et al. (1973). The results of these studies showed that with increased rate of loading the compressive strength and the energy capacity were increased. Neumann et al. (1994-a) reported a significant strain rate dependency of the lumbar anterior longitudinal ligament-bone complex when loaded at different distraction rates. Hukins et al. (1990) found an increase in stiffness with increasing strain rate for lumbar spinal ligaments. There are also reports in the literature of the effects of strain rate on strength and failure characteristics of the ligaments in living animals (Noyes, 1974; Crowninshield and Pope, 1976; Woo et al., 1981). The dynamic responses of human cervical spine ligaments were studied by Yoganandan et al. (1989-b). They showed that strength, stiffness and energy absorbing capacity at failure increased with increasing loading rate. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL - The functional spinal unit (FSU), or the motion segment (as it is popularly called), is the smallest structure of the spine to exhibit biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine. Because the spine may be considered as a structure composed of FSUs connected in series, its total behaviour is a composite of the individual FSUs. Most experimental studies on spinal response are made on individual FSUs (White and Panjabi, 1990). 1273</page><page sequence="4">The FSU consists of two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc, and the connecting ligamentous tissues. The behaviour of a FSU depends upon, for example, the biological and physical properties of its components (bone, disc, ligaments). A vertebra consists of an anterior part, the vertebral body, and a posterior bony ring, the neural arch containing articular, transverse and spinous processes. The pattern of movements of the spine is dependent upon the shape and position of the articulating processes and facet joints. The compressive strength of the vertebrae has been a subject of study over a longer period of time. The earliest biomechanical study of the human spine is probably measurements of the strength of the vertebrae (Messereer, 1880). In general, the vertebrae decrease in strength with age (Bell et al., 1967). There is a high correlation between the vertebral bone mineral content and the mechanical strength of vertebral bone under compression (Hansson et al., 1980). With increasing loading rate, the compressive strength and energy capacity of bone increase (e.g. Panjabi et al., 1973; Hayes, 1983). The intervertebral disc consists of three distinct parts: the nucleus pulposus, the annulus fibrosus, and the cartilaginous end-plates. Along with the facet joints it carries all the compressive loading to which the trunk is subjected (White and Panjabi, 1990). The disc is subjected to tensile, compressive, and shear stresses depending on the specific loading situation. Farfan (1973) suggested that the bending and torsional loads, and not the compressive loads, are the most damaging to the disc. Markolf and Morris (1970) showed that the resistance of the disc to direct shear is high. The disc has time-dependent properties, such as fatigue and viscoelasticity. The water content in the disc (nucleus pulposus) tends to lessen with age, and the load-transferring mechanisms are significantly altered for degenerated discs (Kulak et al., 1976). There are seven ligaments that connect one vertebra to the next. Ligaments are most effective in carrying loads along the direction in which the fibres run. They readily resist tensile forces but buckle when subjected to compression. The anatomy of the ligaments is such that they collectively provide stability to the spine. The contribution to spine stability by an individual ligament is dependent upon its crossection, its distance from the axis of rotation, and its orientation in space (Panjabi et al., 1982). Ligaments, as well as the discs, degenerate with age. In tensile testing of anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments Tkaczuk (1968) found that deformation and energy absorption decrease with age. It has been experimentally determined that ligaments show viscoelastic properties (White and Panjabi, 1990). The variation in the structural and mechanical properties of the lumbar anterior longitudinal ligament during tensile testing may be explained by the vertebral bone mineral content (Neumann et al., 1993-a;1994-a). STATIC AND DYNAMIC LOADING OF SPINAL SEGMENTS - Biomechanical loading is a term describing the application of a force and a moment (torque) on a biological structure. The FSU can be loaded in compression, tension, shear, flexion, extension, lateral bending or torsion. It may also be exposed to combined loads. Flexion loading, defined as a combination of bending moment and shear force, was carried out by Lin et al. (1978), Miller et al. (1986), Osvalder et al. (1990; 1993) and Neumann et al. (1993-b, 1994- b). Such loading gives a good representation of the situation in vivo when the spine is flexed in the forward position. The difficulty in such experiments lies in choosing an appropriate combination of the loads, since the exact direction and combination of the loads in vivo are not properly known (White and Panjabi, 1990). Different methods for applying static loads to a spinal segment have been described in the literature. The loads are usually applied in incremental steps, by means of pulleys, strings and weights (e.g. Panjabi et al., 1975, 1976; Lee and Landgrana, 1984), or by material-testing apparatus allowing the application of different modes of loading (e.g. Lin et al., 1978; Schultz et al, 1979; Miller et al., 1986; Adams and Dolan, 1991). In most experimental studies physiological loads in different directions have been applied, usually a combination with bending moment and compressive force, or shear force and compressive force. The response of the specimen to the applied load is usually presented by load-deformation curves. The response of the specimen to the applied load can be measured with load transducers or load cells situated under the specimen (e.g. Lin et al., 1978; Mickley et al., 1990). This method is especially used for compressive loading. The different transducers available can measure forces and moments (torques) in one, two, or three directions. It is then possible to measure the load response of the specimen and study changes in the force and moment curves during the whole loading sequence. Osvalder et al. (1990) measured the static flexion load response of the lumbar spine with a force and moment transducer situated under the FSU. The load response was reported as the bending moment and the shear force acting in the sagittal disc plane, since the centre of rotation during forward bending is usually located in this region in an intact non-degenerated motion segment (Rolander, 1966; Cossette et al., 1971; Seligman et al., 1984). For dynamic (transient) loading of the in 1274</page><page sequence="5">vitro spine, mechanical (e.g. drop-weights, pendulum), electrical (e.g. asynchronous motor) or hydraulic methods may be utilised. The specific loading situation and the rate of loading determine which method should be used. For the simulation of impact loads similar to those in a traffic situation (duration about 100-200 ms), a mechanical device is an adequate solution. A high rate of loading can then easily be achieved with good repeatability. Willen et al. (1984) and Fredrickson et al. (1992) allowed mechanical drop- weights of 10-30 kg to fall free from a height of 1-2 meters and thus obtained an instant axial compressive loading of the in vitro thoracolumbar spine. Osvalder et al. (1993) designed a method for flexion loading of the spine in which a padded pendulum was used as an impactor. The load response (forces and moments in different directions) of the specimen versus time during dynamic loading can be measured with load transducers which was made by Willen et al. (1984) and Osvalder et al. (1993). AXIAL COMPRESSIVE LOAD - Several experiments under static loading conditions within the physiological range have been carried out with, and without, a compressive pre-load (Panjabi et al., 1977; Posner et al., 1982). To summarise these studies, the application of a pre-load causes increased disc compression and a relaxation of the ligaments. For lumbar specimens exposed to static flexion loads within the physiological range of motion, a pre-load has been reported to cause a decrease in the spinal resistance to bending (decreased bending stiffness) and an increase in the resistance to shear and axial torsion (Panjabi et al., 1977; Miller et al., 1986). On the other hand, Janevic et al (1989) and Adams and Dolan (1991) showed that large compressive pre-loads caused decreased flexibility and thereby the bending stiffness was increased when static loads corresponding to heavy lifting far above the physiological range were applied. Goel et al. (1985) showed that a large pre-load of 400 N applied on whole lumbar spine specimens only made the specimens bend in flexion or extension, since no muscles were present to stabilise the spine. The influence of an axial compressive pre- load on the dynamic loading of spine segments has not been reported so far. In the dynamic experimental set-up for flexion-shear loading of the spine (Osvalder et al., 1993) a compressive pre- load of 120 N was used. Goel et al. (1987) has indicated that 120 N is an appropriate compressive load for an individual lumbar FSU. MOTION ANALYSIS - Different measuring techniques can be considered for studies of the two- and three-dimensional motions of a rigid body. The various methods may be divided into two general groups: stereometry and mechanical methods. Most investigations concerning spinal motions in vitro are performed in two dimensions depending on either the particular loading situation (e.g. flexion or extension movements in the sagittal plane) or the measuring technique utilised. Mechanical transducers (e.g. displacement gauges, strain gauges, electric linear variable differential transformers LVDT) have been used in several experiments concerning spinal motions. Displacement gauges for direct readings can only be utilised for static measurements (Panjabi et al. 1975; 1976; 1977; White et al., 1975; Miller et al., 1986; Mickley et al., 1990, Osvalder et al., 1990; Neumann et al., 1993-b). In these studies readings were taken after 15 s and up to 4 minutes with an accuracy of 0.1 mm. LVDTs may be utilised for the assessment of static and quasi-static motions, but are most convenient for small two and three- dimensional motions in the physiological range of motion (Panjabi et al., 1981; Posner et al., 1982). For three-dimensional motion measurements with LVDTs, Panjabi et al. (1981) achieved an accuracy better than 0.1 mm. Strain gauges can also be utilised for static as well as for dynamic measurements (Liu et al, 1975; Koogle and Piziali, 1977). With this type of transducer it is possible to measure local strain at its point of application but not displacements between different structures. Because of the soft characteristics of the spinal tissues, it is difficult to attach strain gauges on the specimen and to place them in the right position for accurate measurements. Osvalder et al. (1990) used mechanical displacement gauges (dial gauges) to determine vertical displacements, and thereby enable calculation of the flexion angulation with an accuracy of ±0.1°. In stereometry, two positions of a rigid body in space, at the beginning and at the end- of a motion step are recorded (step-by-step motion analysis). The position of the body in space can be recorded for example with visible light (photography, video, high-speed film), X-rays, acoustic waves (Goel et al., 1984) or infrared light (Goel et al., 1985). All these methods can be used when the spinal motions in vitro under static conditions are studied. When three-dimensional motions are determined, recording of two or more views of the body at the same time is necessary. Recordings with visible light and x-rays result in a large number of data points, which have to be properly analysed. By digitising the relevant data points, their positions can be assessed. Principles of kinematics are then utilised to compute, among others, linear and angular displacements, motion trajectories of the body in space. In experiments by Osvalder et al. (1990) and Neumann et al. (1993-b) photographs were taken after each loading step for the assessment of vertical and horizontal displacements of different 1275</page><page sequence="6">markers attached to the specimen, and thereby for example the centre of rotation could be determined. Lee and Landgrana (1984) studied flexion and extension movements of lumbar specimens by means of a video-camera. They could determine motions of markers attached to the specimens with an accuracy of 0.5 mm. For dynamic (transient) conditions, high-speed photography is a convenient method because of the high-frequency requirements of this test. This method was used in dynamic experiments by Osvalder et al. (1993) where the motion of different markers attached to the specimens could be determined with an accuracy of ±0.1 mm. METHODS OF PREPARARTION - Most experimental studies on cadaver spine segments have used the same preparation and treatment methods during dissection, fixation and experimental procedures (Panjabi et al., 1977, 1982; Schultz et al., 1979; Adams and Hutton, 1982; Goel et al., 1985). Spinal sections are obtained from autopsies on patients with no known spinal injury or disease. For specific experiment the sections are divided into appropriate specimens leaving all intervertebral ligaments and joints intact. X-rays are usually taken to detect any abnormalities or degenerative changes in the segments. In some studies the bone mineral content is determined for each vertebra as this factor has shown to be a reliable predictor of the load response of lumbar FSUs (Hansson et al. ,1980; Keller et al. 1987, Neumann et al. 1992, 1993-b;Osvalder et al. 1990, 1993). If the experiments are not going to be done with fresh cadaver segments, the specimens are sealed in plastic bags, frozen and stored at -20°C (e.g. Panjabi et al., 1976). Later the specimens are thawed at room temperature (2-5 hours) or in a refrigerator (12 hours) (Adams and Hutton, 1982). Throughout the entire preparation and testing procedure the specimens are kept moist in nearly 100% humidity in order to preserve the natural hydration of the bone and ligaments. It has been shown by several authors (Sedlin and Hirsch, 1966; Galante, 1967; Tkaczuk, 1968; Woo et al., 1986) that freezing, thawing and refreezing cycles do not appreciably affect the mechanical properties of bone, annulus fibres of the disc, or the longitudinal ligaments under static loading conditions. For large load applications it is difficult to achieve rigid fixation of the specimens as pointed out by for example Miller et al. (1986). During fixation, the upper and lower vertebrae of the specimen are rigidly mounted and fixed in fixation cups by means of different types of wires and screws in a two-component cement (Plastic Padding) (e.g. Liu et al., 1975; Panjabi et al., 1977; Lin et al., 1978; Osvalder et al., 1990, 1993). Adams and Hutton (1982) fixed their specimens with dental plaster and metal hooks. According to Panjabi et al. (1977) the posterior mid-sagittal part of the vertebral body should be mounted at the centre of the fixation cup, and the lower end-plate of the disc should be parallel with the lower cup (tolerance of ±2°) to achieve the same position for all specimens when the load is applied. By this mounting a horizontal reference plane was defined for each FSU. An X-ray study of ten mounted specimens was undertaken and the two planes were in parallel with a difference of 2±1° (Osvalder et al., 1990). BONE MINERAL CONTENT (BMC) - Bone material comprises 70% minerals, mostly calcium, fluorine and magnesium. Theoretically, measurements of bone mass quantity and quality would be of great value when the risk of fractures is predicted. A number of sensitive techniques are available for measuring bone mass at different sites within the body. Such techniques can be invasive or non-invasive, but they primarily quantify bone mass and do not measure the quality of the bone in an adequate way (Chesnut, 1988). In in vitro experiments on the lumbar FSUs (e.g. Neumann et al., 1992, 1993-b), the bone mineral content in the two adjacent vertebrae was determined by means of DPA (Roos and Skoldborn, 1974; Roos 1975). A mean bone mineral content value (in g/cm) for the entire FSU was calculated. The specimen was placed in a water bath and in a position corresponding to its position in vivo. The transmitted radiation of two radionucleotides through the cross-sectional area of each vertebra was measured as the specimen was moved past the sources. This technique is appropriate for the quantification of bone mineral in the spine and has the advantages of good precision, accuracy and quality control (Einhorn, 1988). For in vivo measurements, DPA offers minimal radiation exposure. The difference between bone mineral content measurements with DPA in vivo and in vitro has been determined to be less than 10% (Roos, 1975). The in vitro obtained bone mineral content value can thus be used as a reasonably accurate predictor for in vivo situation. GENERAL DISCUSSION The biomechanical response of the lumbar spine in different directions under normal static physiological loads has been studied in several experiments. Only a few studies so far have described the biomechanical response and failure mechanisms of the lumbar spine to large static loads. Usually, the applied load has been a pure shear force or a pure bending moment combined 1276</page><page sequence="7">with a compressive load. The knowledge about lumbar spine response to combined loads of bending, shear and compression, which is a better representation of the loading situation in real life, is, however, limited. In terms of compressive strength of the lumbar vertebrae static and dynamic loading conditions are already known. Tolerance data and range of motion of the lumbar spine under combined dynamic loads in different directions are extremely limited. It is difficult to extrapolate conclusions to the real life situation from in vivo experimental studies. Magnitude, direction and composition of the forces in real life are factors which have to be taken into consideration during experimental studies. In the in vivo situation, for example, muscular forces are present which contribute to the energy absorption and the stabilisation of the spine. It is also difficult to compare the results from different statical studies of lumbar spine response due to the differences in the experimental design, testing conditions and the biological variation of the specimens. Very few studies of the biomechanical response of the lumbar FSU under dynamic loads have been reported in the literature so far. The experiments on lumbar FSUs have been done with cyclic compressive loading (Liu et al., 1983; Hansson et al., 1987), transient dynamic compressive loading (e.g. Willen et al., 1984) and flexion-distraction loading (Osvalder et al., 1993; Neumann et al., 1994-b). Whole body impact compressive acceleration has been studied by for example Hakim and King (1977). Sled tests with cadavers or volunteers have been made by for example Begeman et al. (1973), Mitai et al. (1978) and Cheng et al. (1979). It is difficult to compare the results obtained in different experimental studies because of differences in magnitude, direction, composition, duration and pulse shape of the applied force as well as differences in the biological material used. In order to find approximate values for comparisons between the biological results concerning flexion-distraction injuries obtained by Osvalder et al. (1993) and Neumann et al. (1994), and the results from crash tests, data were collected from simulations undertaken with a Hybrid III Crash Simulation Dummy restrained with a standard lap-shoulder belt, and with a Hybrid III dummy implemented in the MaDyMo Crash Victim Simulation Program restrained with a lap-shoulder belt as well as with a lap belt. Both simulations were made with a pulse from a safe car equipped with a standard belt system at a velocity of 40 km/h. From the mathematical and mechanical simulations the obtained values for the lower lumbar spine were for the bending moment 2-3 times higher, and for the shear force 3-5 times higher than the presented values in the biological experiments of the ultimate strength of the lumbar spine during flexion-shear impact loading. The flexion angulations obtained in the simulations were about half of those observed in the biological experiments. This could be an indication of to high loads are permitted to be transferred to the lumbar spine in the Hybrid III dummy, and that the lumbar spine in the dummy should be more flexible. Based on these indications, the Hybrid III dummy should primarily be used for comparable measurements of the load response of the lower spine between different test set-ups. In many in vitro experiments on the spine there has been a large variation in the results in spite of a standardized handling of the specimens before and during the experiments. Age, sex, disc level and degeneration are some biological variables which may be related to the strength of a spinal segment (Nachemson et al., 1979; Schultz et al., 1979). Yoganandan et al. (1989-b) found significant differences in energy absorption between normal and degenerated FSUs when these were subjected to gradual compressive loading. Measurements of bone density, porosity and mineral content have explained much of the observed variation in structural and mechanical properties of the bone substance (Urist et al., 1970; Arnold, 1978). CONCLUDING REMARKS The results presented in this survey of the literature have shown that it is possible to perform traumatic static and dynamic experiments on lumbar FSUs with good repeatability and high accuracy. The experiments have contributed to a better understanding of the biomechanical response of the lumbar spine under traumatic static and dynamic loads and of the clinical stability of the spine. This could lead to an improvement of preventive measures, diagnosis and treatment. The results can also be useful for validating static and dynamic models of the lumbar spine and can be used as input data for the development of future crash dummies. The results can also be used to establish injury criteria of the lumbar spine. From the results presented in the littérature some conclusions useful for future in vivo experimental studies can be drawn. The principle for static and dynamic transient loading of lumbar FSUs can be used for other levels of the spine, for example the cervical spine. The measuring techniques presented for the determination of the load response and displacements of the specimens had an accuracy good enough for lower load levels and smaller deformations, as those in the cervical spine. Spine segments show different load 1277</page><page sequence="8">responses at different rates of loading. Therefore, when dynamic tests are carried out, it is important to apply loads with a relevant velocity for the specific loading situation simulated. The biological variation in the specimens must be considered, not only in terms of age and degeneration, but also in terms of bone mineral content in the vertebrae as well as the size of the segments. Therefore, because the biological variation is large, it is recommended that at least five biological in vitro tests are performed for a specific loading situation. Today, a lot of data of the in vitro spine response to static loads are available, especially for the physiological range of motion. For dynamic loads, however, response and tolerance data of the spine are extremely limited, except for vertebral fractures caused by vertical acceleration. In future work, the emphasis should be put on performing dynamic loading of spine segments in different directions with combined loads, with different magnitudes and velocities of the applied load, not only on one motion segment (FSU) but even on multiple motion segments. In a traffic situation today, injuries to the neck are a serious problem, especially in rear-end car collisions. There is not much biological data available on cervical spine tolerance to dynamic loads causing whip-lash injuries. Therefore in future work, the in vitro cervical spine tolerance to impact should have high priority. The results would be useful to validate mechanical and mathematical models of the cervical spine, as well as be a base for the development of better head-restraints and seats that would minimise the severity of spinal injuries in car collisions.
