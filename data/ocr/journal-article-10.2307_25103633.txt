<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIANITY'S MILLSTONE. BY GOLDWIK SMITH, D. C. L., LL. D. At the recent English Church Congress held at Norwich, Pro fessor Bonney, Canon of Manchester, made a bold and honorable attempt to cast a millstone off the neck of Christianity by frankly renouncing belief in the historical character of the earlier books of the Bible. " I cannot deny," he said, " that the increase of scientific knowledge has deprived parts of the earlier boo.ks of the Bible of the historical value which was generally attributed to them by our forefathers. The story of the creation in Genesis, unless we play fast and loose either with words or with science, cannot be brought into harmony with what we have learned from geology. Its ethnological statements are imperfect, if not sometimes inac curate. The stories of the flood and of the Tower of Babel are incredible in their present form. Some historical element may underlie many of the traditions in the first eleven chapters of that book, but this we cannot hope to recover." With the historical character of the chapters relating to the creation, Canon Bonney must resign his belief in the Fall of Adam with his belief in the Fall of Adam he must surrender the doc trine of the Atonement, as connected with that event, and thus relieve conscience of the strain put upon it in struggling to recon cile Vicarious Punishment with our sense of justice. He will also have to lay aside his belief in the Serpent of the Temptation, and in the primeval personality of evil. In Lux Mundi, a collection of essays edited by the Rev erend Principal of Pusey House, and understood to emanate from the High Church quarter, we find plain indications that the unhistoric character, so frankly recognized by the learned Canon in the opening chapters of Genesis, is recognized in other</page><page sequence="2">704 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. parts of Old Testament history by High Churchmen, who, hav ing studied recent criticism, feel, like the Canon, that there is a millstone to be cast off. One of these essayists admits that the "battle of historical record cannot be fought on the field of the Old Testament as it can on that of the New " ; that " very little of the early record can be securely traced to a period near the events"; and that "the Church cannot insist upon the histori cal character of the earliest records of the ancient church in detail as she can on the historical character of the Gospels or the Acts of the Apostles." The same writer seems ready to entertain the view that the "books of Chronicles representa later and less historical version of Israel's history than that given in Samuel and Kings," and that they "represent the version of that history which had become current in the priestly schools." "Conscious perversion" he will not acknowledge, but in the theory of "unconscious idealizing" of history he is willing, apparently, to acquiesce. Inspiration, he thinks, is consistent with this sort of "idealizing," though it excludes conscious deception or pious fraud. Conscious deception or pious fraud no large minded and instructed critic of primeval records would be inclined to charge. But "ideal" is apparently only another name for " mythical," and it is difficult to see how myths can in any sense be inspired, or why, if the records are in any sense inspired, the Church should not be able to insist on their histori cal character. "In detail" is a saving expression; but the details make up the history, and if the truth of the details can not be guaranteed, what is our guarantee for the truth of the whole ? Human testimony, no doubt, may sometimes fail in minor particulars, while in the main account of the matter it is true. But is it conceivable that the Holy Spirit, in dictating the record of God's dealings with mankind for our instruction in the way of life, should simulate the defects of human evidence ? A veil which has long hung before the eyes of free inquiry when they were turned on the origin and state of man is removed by the Canon's renunciations. The present writer, as a student at college, attended the lectures of Dr. Buckland, a pioneer in geology ; and he remembers the desperate shifts to which the lecturer was driven in his efforts to reconcile the facts of his science with the Mosaic cosmogony, the literal truth of which he did not venture to impugn. By a " day," Dr. Buckland said,</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIANITY'S MILLSTONE. 705 Moses meant a geological period, though the text says that each day was made up of a morning and an evening, while the Deca logue fixes the sense by enjoining the observance of the seventh day as that on which the Creator rested after the six days' labor of creation. How the professor dealt with fossil records of geo logical races and the appearance of death in the world before the fall of man, the writer does not now remember. It is not very long since a preacher before an educated audience could meet the objection to the Mosaic deluge arising from the position of stones in the mountains of Auvergne, which such a cataclysm must have swept away, bv the simple expedient of affirming that when the deluge was over, the stones had been restored to their places by miracle. Nay, were not Mr. Gladstone's great intellectual powers the other day exerted to prove that the Creator, in dic tating to Moses the account of the creation, had come wonder fully near the scientific truth and almost anticipated the nebular hypothesis ? From the conceptions of science, geocentricism, derived from the Mosaic cosmogony, may have been "banished, but over those of theology its cloud still heavily hangs. The consecrated im pression has survived the distinct belief, and faith shrinks from the theological revolution which the abandonment of the im pression would involve. The history of every nation begins with myth. A primeval tribe keeps no record, and a nation in its maturity has no more recollection of what happened in its infancy than a man of what happened to him in his cradle. It is needless to say that the first book of Livy is a tissue of fable, though the Romans were great keepers of records and matter-of-fact as a people. When the age of reflection arrives and the nation begins to speculate on its origin, it gives itself a mythical founder, a Theseus, a Romulus, or an Abraham, and ascribes to him its ancestral institutions or customs. In his history also are found the keys to immemorial names and the origin of mysterious or venerated objects. It is a rule of criticism that we cannot by any critical alembic extract materials for history out of fable. If the details of a story are fabulous, so is the whole. If the details of Abraham's story?the appearances of the Deity to him, so strangely anthropomorphic, the miraculous birth of his son when his wife was ninety years old, his adventures with Sarah in Egypt and afterwards in Gerar, YOL. CLXI.?no. 469. 45</page><page sequence="4">706 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. evidently two versions of the same legend, the sacrifice of his son arrested by the angel, with the episode of Lot, the destruction of the Cities of the Plain, and the turning of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt?are plainly unhistorical, the whole story must be relegated to the domain of tribal fancy. We cannot make a real personage out of unrealities or fix a place for him in unrecorded time. That the alleged record is of a date posterior by many cen turies to the events, and therefore no record at all, plainly ap pears from the mention of Kings of Israel in Genesis (xxxvi., 31). No reason has been shown for supposing that the passage is an interpolation, while the suggestion that it is prophetic is extrava gant. It stamps the date of the book, like the mention of the death of Moses in Deuteronomy, to get rid of which efforts equally desperate are made. The canon of Sir George Corne wall Lewis,limiting the trustworthiness of oral tradition toa single century, may be too rigid ; but we certainly cannot trust oral tradition for such a period as that between the call of Abra ham and the Kings, especially when, the alleged events being miraculous, an extraordinary amount of evidence is necessary to justify belief. The figure of the patriarch Abraham, a typical sheikh, as well as the father of Israel, is exceptionally vivid, and his history is exceptionally dramatic. It is needless to say that the history contains episodes of striking beauty, such as the meeting of the steward with Rebekah, the scene of Hagar and her child nearly perishing in the wilderness, and the sacrifice of Isaac. But to regard Abraham as a real founder, not only of a nation, but of the Church, and as the chosen medium of communication between God and man, sound criticism will no longer allow us; and sound criticism, like genuine science, is the voice of the Spirit of Truth. A writer in Lux Mundi, already quoted, avows his belief that " the modern development of historical criticism is reaching results as sure, where it is fairly used, as scientific inquiry." He significantly reminds churchmen of the warning conveyed by the name of Galileo. Why should we any longer cling to that which, whatever it may have been to the men of a primeval tribe, is to us a low and narrow conception of the Deity? Why should we force ourselves to believe that the Being who fills eternity and infinity became the guest of a Hebrew sheikh ; entered into a covenant with the sheikh's tribe, to the</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIANITYS MILLSTONE. 707 exclusion of the rest of the human race ; and as the seal of the covenant ordained the perpetuation of a barbarous tribal rite ? There have been bibliolaters so extreme as to wish even con verted Jews to continue the practice to which the promise was mysteriously annexed. Tribalism may attach inordinate value to genealogies as well as to ancestral rites, but can we imagine the author of the universe limiting his providential regard and his communication of vital truth to his creatures by tribal lines ? Every tribe is the chosen people of its own god ; enjoys a monopoly of his favor ; is upheld by him against the interest of other nations, and especially protected by him in war. It is he who gives it victory, and if stones fall or are hurled on the en emy retreating through a rocky pass, it is he who casts them down (Joshua x., 11). Christianity is the denial of Jewish tribalism, proclaiming that all nations have been made of one blood to dwell together on the earth, and are sharers alike in the care of Providence. Of the bad effects of a conception of God drawn from the conceptions of J ewish tribalism, the least is the waste of money and effort in desperate attempts to convert the Jews. Of the history of the other Patriarchs the texture is apparently the same as that of the history of Abraham. They are mythical founders of a race, a character which extends to Ishmael and Esau. In fact the chapters relating to them are full of what, in an ordinary case, would be called ethnological myth. Of con temporary or anything like contemporary record, even supposing the Pentateuch to have been written by Moses, there can be no pretence. Thus it is in the absence of anything like evidence that we have been called upon to accept such incidents as the bodily wrestling of Jehovah with Jacob, and the appearance to Jacob in a dream of an angel who is the organ of a supernatural com munication about the speckles of the rams or he-goats. Most vivid and memorable, no doubt, are the characters of Esau, the typical father of the hunter tribe, and that of Jacob in whose unscrupulous and successful cunning we have a picture such as the anti-Semite would now draw of his enemy, the financial Jew. These chapters are full of legends connected with fanciful inter pretations of names, such as Jehovah-Jireh (Genesis xxii., 14) ; fanciful accounts of immemorial monuments, such as Jacob's pillar; or of tribal customs, such as that of refraining from a</page><page sequence="6">708 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. particular sinew because it had been touched and made to shrink by Jehovah in wrestling with Jacob. Extraordinary simplicity is surely displayed by the pious commentators who appeal to the custom as evidence of the historic event. Much labor has been spent in efforts to identify the Pharaoh of the Exodus and to fix the date of that event and its connection with Egyptian history. Still more labor has been spent in tracing the route of the Israelites through the wilderness and explaining away the tremendous difficulties of the narrative. What if the whole is mythical ? There is a famine in Palestine. The Patri arch sends his ten sons, each with an ass and a sack, across the desert to buy food in Egypt. Provisions must have been furn ished them for their journey, and of what they bought they must have consumed not a little on their journey home. This seems improbable, nor was it very likely that the ten should strike the exact place where their brother Joseph was in power. Of the poetic character of the story of Joseph, with its miraculous dreams and their interpretations, there surely can be no doubt. Yet upon the story of Joseph and his brethren all the rest appar ently hangs. We might almost renounce the task of analysing the rest of the narrative?the attempt of the Egyptian rulers to extirpate the Hebrews by the strange command to the midwives when they might have taken a shorter and surer course; the con test in thaumaturgy between the magicians of Jehovah and those of Egypt ; the plagues sent upon the helpless people of Egypt to make their ruler do that which Omnipotence might at once have done by its fiat ; the extraordinary multiplication of the Hebrews, whose adult males, in spite of the destruction of their male children, amount to six hundred thousand, a number which implies a total population of at least two millions ; their sudden appearance as an armed host though they had just been repre sented as the unresisting bondsmen of the Egyptians?; their wanderings for forty years within the narrow limits of the Si naitic peninsula, where, though the region is desert, they find subsistence not only for themselves but for their innumerable flocks and herds ; their construction of a tabernacle where ma terials for it could not have been found ; the plague of fiery serpents which was sent among them and the brazen serpent by looking on which they were healed ; the miraculous destruc tion of the impious opponents of an exclusive priesthood ; the</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIANITY'S MILLSTONE. 709 giants of Canaan ; the victories gained over native tribes by the direct interposition of Heaven ; the strange episode of Balaam and his colloquy with his ass ; the stopping of the sun and moon that Israel might have time for the pursuit and slaughter of his enemies. This last incident alone seems enough to stamp the legendary character of the whole. In vain we attempt to reduce the miracle, which would imply a disturbance of the entire solar system, to a mere prolongation of the daylight. The Old Testa ment is altogether geocentric, and not merely in the phenomenal sense. The sun and moon are made " for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth," and with them is coupled the creation of the stars. The writer of the book of Joshua cites the book of Jasher as evidence of the miracle. Was the book of Jasher inspired ? Could an inspired writer need or rest on the evidence of one who was uninspired ? Whether any sojourn of the Hebrews in Egypt or any real connection with that country is denoted by the visit of Abraham to Egypt and afterwards by the story of the Exodus, it is for Egyptologists to determine. Of the appearance of Hebrew forms on Egyptian monuments, Egyptian conquest would appear to give a sufficient explanation. , The history of the Exodus is connected with the account of the institution of the Passover, and analogy may lead us to surmise that national imagination has been busy in explaining the origin of an immemorial rite. We are, then, in no way bound to believe that God so identi fied himself with a favored tribe as to license it to invade a num ber of other tribes which had done it no wrong, to slaughter them and take possession of their land. We are in no way bound to believe that he, by the mouth of Moses, rebuked his chosen people for saving alive the women and children of the Midianites and bade them kill every male among the little ones and every woman that had known man (Numbers xxxi., 17) ; or that he commanded them to slay, not only man, woman, and child, but the dumb animals, everything that breathed, in a captured city. To the objections raised by humanity against the slaughter of the Canaanites, Christian apologists have made various and, as one of their number admits, not very consistent replies. Some say that in conquering Canaan the Israelites did but recover their own, a plea which, even if it had not been ousted by prescription, would be totally inconsistent with the account of the sojourning</page><page sequence="8">710 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. of Abraham and of his purchase of plots of land. Others main tain that, having been driven by force from Egypt, they had a right to help themselves to a home where they could find it, and to put all the existing inhabitants to the sword. The bequest of Noah is also pleaded. But at last the apologist has to fall back upon the simple command of God, which is justified on the ground that the Canaanites were idolaters, they never having heard of the true God. Such examples as the slaughter of the Canaanites, the killing of Sisera, the assassination of Eglon, the hewing of Agag in pieces by Samuel before the Lord, Elijah's massacre of the prophets of Baal, the hanging of Haman with his ten sons, commemorated in the hideous feast of Purim, have, it is needless to say, had a deplorable effect in forming the harsher and darker parts of the character which calls itself Christian. They are responsible in no small degree for murderous persecutions, and for the extirpation or oppression of heathen races. The dark side of the Puritan character in particular is traceable to their influence. Macaulay mentions a fanatical Scotch Calvinist whose writings, he says, hardly bear a trace of acquaintance with the New Testament. Jael, when she decoyed her husband's ally into her tent and slew him while he was resting trustfully beneath it, broke in the most signal manner the sacred rule of Arab hospitality, as well as the ordinary moral law. The comment of orthodoxy upon this is: "If we can overlook the treachery and violence which belong to the age and country, and bear in mind Jael's ardent sympathies with the oppressed people of God, her faith in the right of Israel to possess the land in which they were now slaves, her zeal for the glory of Jehovah as against the gods of Canaan, and the heroic courage and firmness with which she executed her deadly purpose, we shall be ready to yield to her the praise which is her due."* The extenuating motives supplied by the commentator are not to be found in the text. To reconcile us to the assassination of Eglon, a distinction is drawn between God's providential order and his moral law, the providential order or daining what the moral law would forbid. The writer heard the other day a very beautiful Christian sermon on the purity of heart in virtue of which good men see God. But the lesson of the day, read before that sermon, was * The Speaker's Commentary, ad loc.</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIANITY'S MILLSTONE. Ill the history of Jehu. Jehu, a usurper, begins by murdering Joram, the son of his master Ahab, King of Israel, and Ahaziah, the King of Judah, neither of whom had done him any wrong. He then has Jezebel, Ahab's widow, killed by her own servants. Next he suborns the guardians and tutors of Ahab's seventy sons in Samaria to murder the children committed to their care and send the seventy heads to him in baskets to be piled at the gate of the city. Then he butchers the brethren of Ahaziah, King of Judah, with whom he falls in on the road, two-and forty in number, for no specified or apparent crime. On his arrival at Samaria there is more butchery. Finally he entraps all the worshippers of Baal, by an invitation to a solemn as sembly, and massacres them to a man. At the end of this series of atrocities the Lord is made to say to him, "Because thou, hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of Ahab all that was in my heart, thy children unto the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel." David is loyal, chivalrous, ardent in friendship, and combines with adventurous valor the tenderness which has led to our accepting him as the writer of some of the Psalms. So far, he is an object of our admiration, due allowance for time and cir cumstance being made. But he is guilty of murder and adultery, both in the first degree ; he puts to death with hideous tortures the people of a captured city ; on his death-bed he bequeaths to his son a murderous legacy of vengeance ; he exemplifies by his treatment of his ten concubines, whom he shuts up for life, the most cruel evils of polygamy (2 Samuel, xx., 3). The man after God's own heart he might be deemed by a primitive priest hood to whose divinity he was always true ; but it is hardly pos sible that he should be so deemed by a moral civilization. Still less possible is it that we should imagine the issues of spiritual life to be so shut up that from this man's loins salvation would be bound to spring. The books of the Old Testament, and notably the historical books, are for the most part by unknown authors and of un known dates. Nor do they put forward themselves any claim to inspiration. Where they cite elder authorities, such as the book of Jasher, they in effect declare themselves indebted to human records, and therefore uninspired. Preachers, especially preachers</page><page sequence="10">712 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. of reform, speak in the name of Heaven. Oriental and primitive preachers speak as the inspired organs of Heaven. The Prophets, whose name, with its modern connotation, is scarcely more appro priate than it would be if applied to Savonarola or John Wesley, are in this respect like others of their class. One of them when bidden to prophesy calls for a minstrel, under the influence of whose strains the hand of the Lord comes upon him (2 Kings, iii., 15; see also 1 Samuel, x., 5). All seers, as their name im ports, have visions. Primitive lawgivers speak by divine com mand. In no other way, apparently, is inspiration claimed by the authors of the Old Testament. Jesus came to substitute a religion of conscience for that of law, a religion of humanity for that of the tribe, worship in spirit and in truth for worship in the Temple. His preaching was a reaction against the Judaism then impersonated in the Pharisee, afterwards developed in the Talmud, and now fully represented in the Talmudic Jew. But he was not a revolutionist. Like Socrates, he accepted established institutions, including the national ritual, and in that sense fulfilled all righteousness. He accepted the sacred books among the rest, and in addressing an audience which believed in them, he cited them and appealed to their authority in the usual way. He cites the book of Jonah, and in terms which seem to show that he regards it as a real his tory ; so that a literalist, like the late Dr. Liddon, took fire at being told that the book was an apologue, considering this an impeachment of the veracity of Jesus. Yet few, even of the most orthodox, would now profess to believe that Jonah sojourned in the belly of a fish. St. Paul in like manner treats the narra tive of the Fall of Adam in Genesis as historical and connects a doctrine with it, though the mythical character of the narrative is admitted, as we have seen, even by a dignitary of the Church. The Evangelists, simple-minded, find in the sacred books of their nation prognostications of the character and mission of Jesus. Sometimes, as critical examination shows, a little has been enough to satisfy their uncritical minds (see Matthew ii., 16 ; xxi., 5). But surely it is something like a platitude to as cribe to them such an idea of Old Testament prophecy as is worked out for us by modern divines such as Keith. No real and specific prediction of the advent of Jesus, or of any event in his life, can be produced from the books of the Old Testament.</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTIANITYS MILLSTONE. 713 At most we find passages or phrases which are capable of a spirit ual application, and in that metaphorical sense prophetic. Even of the famous passage in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, if it is read without strong prepossessions, no more than this can be said. Beyond contest and almost beyond compare is the beauty, spiritual as well as lyrical, of some of the Psalms. But there are others which it is shocking to hear a Christian congregation re citing, still more shocking, perhaps, to hear it chanting in a church. To wish that your enemy's wife may be a widow, and that his children may be fatherless and have none to pity them, is Oriental. To wish that his prayer may be turned to sin and that Satan may stand at his right hand, to wish in short for his spiritual ruin, is surely Oriental and something more. The writer in Lux Mundi, already cited, would persuade himself and us that these utterances are not those of personal spite, but " the claim which righteous Israel makes upon God that He should vindicate himself and let her eyes see how righteousness turns again to judgment." This is the way in which we have been led by our traditional belief in the inspiration of the Old Testament to play fast and loose with our understandings and with our moral sense. It might almost as well be pretended, when the Greek poet Theognis longs to drink the blood of his political enemies, that he is not actuated by hatred, but has some great moral ob ject in his mind. What is the Old Testament ? It is the entire body of Hebrew literature, theology, philosophy, history, fiction, and poetry, in cluding the poetry of love as well as that of religion. We have bound it all up together as a single book, and bound up that book with the New Testament, as though the religion of the two were the same and the slaughter of the Canaanites or the massacre of the day of Purim were a step towards Christian brotherhood and the Sermon on the Mount. We have forcibly turned Hebrew literature into a sort of cryptogram of Christianity. The love song called The Song of Solomon has been turned into a crypto grammic description of the union of Christ with his Church. A certain divine, when his advice was asked about the method of reading the Scriptures, used to say that his method was to begin at the beginning and read to the end ; so that he would spend three hours at least on the Old Testament for one that he spent on</page><page sequence="12">714 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. the New, and would read the list of the Dukes of Edom as often as he read the Sermon on the Mount. The first step towards a rational appreciation of the Old Testament is to break up the volume, separate the acts of Joshua or Jehu from the teachings of Jesus, and the different books of the Old Testament from each other. The language of the Jews was the same as that of the other inhabitants of Canaan, and it seems probable that their religion also was originally the same. This view appears more likely and more consistent with analogy than the supposition that the Jews, having set out with tribal monotheism, fell away from it to fetishism, idolatry, and to the worship of the powers of nature, with sensual rites. We are told in fact (Joshua xxiv., 2) that the ancestors of Abraham served other gods. How, or by what influences, whether those of individual reformers like the proph ets, or of general circumstance, the nation rose from fetishism and nature-worship to tribal monotheism of an eminently pure and exalted type seems to be a historical mystery. Higher than to tribal monotheism it did not rise ; at least it advanced no further than to the belief that its god was supreme in power as well as in character to all other gods, and thus Lord of the whole earth. He was still the God of Israel, and the Jews were still his chosen people. Judaism, therefore, never reached the religious elevation of some chosen spirits among the heathen world, such as Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and Epictetus ; although the Jewish belief was more intense than that of the philosophers and extended not only to a select circle but to a portion at least of the people. Nor could the Jew, hampered as he was by lingering tribal ism, form a conception of the universality and majesty of the moral law such as we find in Plato or in Cicero. There is nothing in the Hebrew writings like a passage in Cicero's Republic, pre served by Lactantius : "There is a true law, right reason, in unison with nature, all-embracing, consistent, and eternal, which, by its commands, calls to duty, by its prohibitions, deters from crime, which, however, never addresses to the good its commands or its prohibitions in vain, nor by command or prohibition moves the wicked. This law cannot be amended, nor can any clause of it be repealed, nor can it be abrogated as a whole. By no vote either of the Senate or of the people, can we be released from it.</page><page sequence="13">CHRISTIANITYS MILLSTONE. 715 It requires none to explain or to interpret it. Nor will there be one law at Rome and another at Athens; one now, and another hereafter. For all nations and for all time there will be one law, immutable and eternal ; there will be a common master and ruler of all?God, the f ramer, exponent, and enactor of this law, whom he who fails to obey will be recreant to himself, and, renouncing human nature, will, by that very fact, incur the severest punish ment, even though he should escape other penalties real or supposed."* Equally broad is the language of the De Legi bus : " Since, then, nothing is superior to reason, whether in God or man, it is by partnership in reason, above all, that man is connected with God. Partnership in reason is partnership in right reason ; and as law is right reason, law again is a bond between God and man. Community of law is community of right. Those to whom these things are common are citizens of the same commonwealth. Ii men obey the same power and rule, much more do they obey this celestial code, the divine mind and the supreme power of God. So that we must regard this universe as one and a single commonwealth of gods and men. And whereas in states, on a principle of which we will speak in the proper place, the position of the citizen is marked by his family ties, in the universal nature of things we have something more august and glorious?the bond of kinship between gods and men."f Of a belief in the immortality of the soul no evidence can be found in the Old Testament, though readers of the Bible who persist in using the unrevised version may remain under the im pression that the doctrine is found in Job. Sheol is merely, like the Hades of the Odyssey, a shadowy abode of the Dead. The rewards and punishments of the Old Testament are temporal and material; its rewards are* wealth and offspring, its punishments are beggary and childlessness. The only immortality of which there is any idea in it is the perpetuation of a man's family in his tribe. The vindication and requital of Job's virtue are added wealth and multiplied offspring. Nor do we find in the Old Test ament that moral immortality, if the. expression may be used, which is found in Greek and Roman philosophers, who, without speaking definitely of a life after death, identify the virtuous * Divin, lnstit., VI., 8. f De Leg,, L, 7.</page><page sequence="14">716 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. man with the undying power of virtue and intimate that it would be well with him in the sum of things. Not assuredly that the Hebrew literature lacks qualities, irre spective of its dogmatic position, such as may account for the hold which it has retained, in spite of its primeval cosmogony, theology, or morality, on the allegiance of civilized minds. The sublimity of its cosmogony impressed, as we know, Longinus. Voltaire him self could hardly have failed to acknowledge the magnificence of some parts of the prophetic writings, though in other parts he might find marks for his satire. All must be touched by the beauty of the story of Joseph, and the Book of Ruth. Admir able are both the religious exaltation and the lyrical excellence of some of the Psalms. The histories are marred by tribalism, primeval inhumanity, and fanaticism; but they derive dignity as well as unity from the continuous purpose which runs through them, and which in the main is moral; since Jehovah was a God of rightousness and purity, perhaps even of mercy, in contrast with the gods of other tribes, and his worship, though ritual, sacrificial, and unlike the worship "in spirit and in truth," the ad vent of which was proclaimed to the woman of Samaria, was yet spiritual compared with that of deities whose votaries gashed themselves with knives or celebrated lascivious orgies beneath the sacred tree. Hebrew law is primitive, and the idea of reviving it, conceived by some of the Puritans, was absurd. But it is an improvement in primitive law. It makes human life sacred, treating murder as a crime to be punished with death, not as a mere injury to be compounded by a fine. It recognizes the avenger of blood, the rude minister of justice before the institution of police; but it confines his office to the case of wilful murder, and forbids heredi tary blood-feuds. It recognizes asylum, a necessary check on wild primeval passion, but confines it to accidental homicide, ordain ing that if a man slay his neighbor with guilt, he shall be taken, even from the altar, and put to death. It recognizes the father's power of life and death over his child, patria potestas, as the Ro man called it, but unlike the hideous Roman law, it requires pub lic procedure and a definite charge, while it secures mercy by re quiring the concurrence of the mother. It recognizes polygamy, but strives to temper the jealousies and injustice of the harem. It is comparatively hospitable and liberal in its treatment of the</page><page sequence="15">CHRISTIAN1TYS MILLSTONE. Ill stranger. Its Sabbath was most beneficent, especially to the slave, and strictness was essential to the observance among a primitive people. The ordeal is confined to the particular case of a wife suspected of infidelity, and divination is forbidden save by the Urim and Thummim. The law mitigates the customs of war, requiring that a city shall be summoned before it is besieged, and forbidding the cutting down of the fruit trees in a hostile country, which was regularly practiced by the Greeks ; while the female captive, instead of being dragged at once to the bed of the captor, is allowed a month of mourning. Nor is war ex alted or encouraged, as it was among the Assyrians and the Persians. Service is to be voluntary ; captains are to be chosen only when the army takes the field, so that there would be no military class ; horses and chariots are not to be multiplied. Jehovah, though a God of battles, is not characteristically so. Not victory in war, but peace, is the normal blessing. Kings it was expected the Israelites would have like the nations around them. But unlike the kings of the nations around them, their king was to be the choice of the nation, he was to be under the law, which he was to study that his heart might not be lifted up among his brethren, and his luxury, his harem, his accumulation of treasure, and his mil itary establishment were to be kept within bounds. Finally, while there was to be a priestly order, that order was not to be a caste. The L?vites were to be ordained by the laying on of the hands of the whole assembly of Israel. Nor, while the ritual was consigned to the priesthood, was religious teaching confined to them ; its organs were the prophet and the psalmist. Worship was sacrificial, and all sacrifice is irrational. But there was no human sacrifice, and the scape-goat was a goat, not, as among the pol ished Athenians, a man. The American slave-owner could ap peal to the Old Testament as a warrant for his institution. Slav ery there was everywhere in primitive times, but the Hebrew slave-law is more merciful than that either of Greece or Rome, notwithstanding the ordinance, shocking to our sense, which held the master blameless for killing his slave if death was not immedi ate, on the ground that the slave "was his money."* The belief An essay written by the author on the guestion " Does the Bible Sanction Amer ican Slavery? " has probably been long fcince forgotten. In its line of argument against slavery as an anachronistic and immoral revival of a primitive and once *noral institution it was consistent? with the present paper. But the essay was written in the penumbra of orthodoxy and would now require very great modification.</page><page sequence="16">718 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. in witchcraft as a crime to be punished by death unhappily is also true, and, though not prominent, gave birth in mis guided Christendom to an almost incredible series of atrocities. How far these ordinances actually took effect, how far they were speculative and ideal, we cannot say. The ordinance against cutting down the fruit trees in an enemy's country certainly was not observed, for the fruit trees of the Moabites are cut down, Elisha giving the word {?I Kings, iii., 19). The agricultural polity of family freeholds, reverting to the family in the year of Jubilee, may safely be said to have never come into practical ex istence but to have been the ideal republic of some very Hebrew Plato. From the social point of view, perhaps the most notable passages of the Old Testament are those rebuking the selfishness of wealth and the oppression of the poor in the prophetic writings and the Psalms, which have supplied weapons for the champions of social justice. There is scarcely anything like these in Greek or Roman literature. Juvenal complains of the contempt and in sult to which poverty exposes a man, but he does not denounce social oppression. In this respect the Mahometan and the Budd hist are perhaps superior to the Greek or Roman. But we shall hardly find anywhere a moral force equal in intensity to that of the Hebrew prophets, narrowly local and national though their preaching is. Religion in the primitive state is completely identified with nationality. For a member of the tribe or of the nation which inherited the religion of the tribe to worship any but the tribal or national god or gods is treason punishable by death. " He that sacrificeth unto any god save unto the Lord only he shall be utterly destroyed." To the importation of this feature of an obsolete tribalism into Christianity, Christendom in part at lea3t owes the fatal identification of the Church with the State, the extermination of the Albigenses, the religious wars, the In quisition, the burning of Servetus. At the end of the seven teenth century a boy was put to death by the Calvinistic min isters of Scotland for having blasphemed the Lord by question ing the dogma of the Trinity. That which is not a supernatural revelation may still, so far as it is good, be a manifestation of the Divine. As a manifesta tion of the Divine the Hebrew books, teaching righteouness and purity, may have their place in our love and admiration for ever ;</page><page sequence="17">CHRISTIANITY'S MILLSTONE. 719 but the time has surely come when as a supernatural revelation they should be frankly though reverently laid aside, and no more allowed to cloud the vision of free inquiry or to cast the shadow of primeval religion and law over our modern life, as they do when Sabbatarianism debars us from innocent recreation on our day of rest ; for it is the Jewish Sabbath that is really before the Sabbatarian's mind. It is useless, and is but paltering with the truth to set up, like the writer in Lux Mundi, the figment of a semi-inspiration. An inspiration which errs, which contra dicts itself, which dictates manifest incredibilities, such as the stopping of the sun, Balaam's speaking ass, Elisha's avenging bears, or the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar, is no inspiration at all. It requires the supplementary action of human criticism to winnow the truth from the falsehood, and the result of the process varies with the personal tendencies of the critics. No body would ever have thought of it except as an expedient to cover retreat. We do but tamper with our own understandings and consciences by such attempts at once to hold on and let go, to retain the shadow of a belief when the substance has passed away. The believers in Yerbal inspiration, of whom some still remain, desperate as are the difficulties with which they have to contend, stand comparatively on firm ground. Verbal inspira tion is at all events a consecrated tradition ; semi-inspiration is a subterfuge, and npthing more. These are troublous times. The trouble is everywhere : in politics, in the social system, in relig ion. But the storm centre seems to be in the region of religion. The fundamental beliefs on which our social system has hitherto rested are giving way. To replace them before the edifice falls, and at the same time to give us such knowledge as may be at tainable of man's estate and destiny, thought must be entirely free.
