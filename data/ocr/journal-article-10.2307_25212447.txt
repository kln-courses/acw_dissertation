The appearance of this magnificent volume, the first of three, will be acclaimed with gratitude and delight by all concerned with South Asian prehistory, with the evolution of writing, or with the study of glyptic art and usage. Volume 2 will assemble the collections in Pakistan and Volume 3 those outside the sub-continent.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 165 Professor Parp?la has for some twenty years been working with his colleagues on a concordance to the Indus inscriptions. This has undergone several revisions, and the latest version will be published after the completion of the present Corpus. Here the objects are rightly allotted sequence numbers according to a completely fresh system, based on initial letters or letter-groups to indicate the sites, and a logical ordering of the artefacts. A table of cross-references relates each new identity number to its equivalents in the Finnish Concordance, the Excavation Report and the Museum Register, and also gives the sources of the photographs. Wherever possible, new impressions have been made from the seals, and the standard format consists of photographs of both the seal and the impression at natural scale, or where preferable at double size. Where useful, extra photographs taken in different conditions are provided and thirty five enlarged photographs in colour are provided for objects of special interest. Reasonably enough, no line-sketches or sign-lists are printed, for these will form the bulk of the promised new Concordance. The object of this Corpus is to provide the scholar with the best possible reference material in default of autopsy. The Corpus will include many hundreds of hitherto unpublished seals from the old excavations of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, and of course from the newly discovered sites. After perusal of this first volume, the reader is left with a first impression of the similarity of the artistic conventions, even at widely separated sites, at least with regard to the most common seal designs. The unicorns are all poised over the same "brazier", the buffaloes eat from the same two-handled bowl and the zebu wear the same elegant dewlaps. However, on closer inspection there appear many exceptions to this general rule. The several "anthropomorphic" figures, often with characteristic spreading "horns", especially on the bar shaped "tablets" in bas-relief, open up a new field for interpretation. The "archer" engravings on the copper tablets M 585-588, and the incised "tablets" in the shape of fishes and hares (H 329-333), display an unexpectedly free and expressive spirit which seems at odds with the highly stylized format of the seals. The "composite" animals are comic and inventive and some designs are so eccentric as to deserve the label "foreign" : the antithetic deer on M 353 for example could almost be Cretan, and the cylinder K 65 from Kalibangan with a three-figure group and centaur, would not be out of place in Syria. The Indus Civilization is the least understood of the great riverine cultures of the Bronze Age. In its full urban phase it endured for little more than five hundred years before its eclipse in the middle of the second millennium, and it was revealed to scholarship little more than half a century ago. Among those who have attacked the problem of its tantalizing script, Professor Parp?la and his team already occupy a distinguished place, through their formulation of the Concordance and on their interpretation of the writing on the principle of homonyms in a Dravidian language. Any further progress in this field will certainly be founded on this Corpus of which the editors and their sponsors, notably UNESCO and the Finnish Academy of Sciences, may justifiably be proud.
