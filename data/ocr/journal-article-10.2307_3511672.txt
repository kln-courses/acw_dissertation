This study explores the relationship between religiosity and loyalty to the President. Data were gathered by means of questionnaires from college stu- dents at six different universities in different states. The analysis of the data reveals that the various elements in religiosity are dichotomous in their impact on loyalty to the President. Church related activities and rituals have a positive impact while prayer has a negative impact. The interactive affect of social class with religion on loyalty is minimal. The reason for this, we propose, is that the sample, consisting of college students, has little if any class variation. Our findings suggest the religious duality of church-priest as opposed to private-prophetic religion stand in a dialectical relationship and exert a dia- metric effect on the political institution. One recurring theme in sociology and history is the close and supportive rela- tionship which has existed between religious institutions and the political elite. Church leaders have on a number of occasions been in the forefront of revolution- ary movements (Lewy, 1974; Cohn, 1970; Worsley, 1968), but as Peter Berger (1951) observed, while "there are liberating movements that sail under religious flags ... there can be little doubts about the overwhelming conservative and inhibitory effect of religion in most periods of history." The inhibitory force of religion manifests itself in two ways. First, it produces an opposition to social and political change, and second, it induces a sense of commit- ment and loyalty to the ruling elite. Of major importance here are the various theoretical arguments and historical analysis by Marx and Engels, 1957; Glock and Stark, 1965; G. Marx, 1967; Pope, 1942; and Thompson, 1966. Most researchers in the area of sociology and religion have concentrated on the former and found some evidence of the conservatizing nature of religion. (For an excellent critical summary of these researches, see Wuthnow, 1973). Very few researchers, however, have sought to examine the latter problem, namely, the way religious beliefs and practices influence loyalty to the political elite. In this research we propose to examine the relationship between the various dimensions of religiosity and their relationship with and impact on adherents' loyalty to the U.S. president. It is hoped that this study thus will contribute to the general knowledge of the relationship between religion and the ruling elite. While the affinity between the ruling elite and the church can be explained from a number of perspectives, the Marxist explanation is most frequently cited. Two ideas in particular are central to this theory. The first is expressed in Marx's assertion, articulated both in this Eighteenth Brumaire (Marx, 1968, p. 96) and in the Preface (Marx, 1968, p. 181) that different forms of property are associated with given modes of sentiment, illusions and Weltanschauungen. In short, that the</page><page sequence="2">179 economic structures of society are the real foundation on which the superstructure, the social institutions, stands. The second idea expounded in the German Ideology, states that "The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of production at its disposal, consequently also controls the means of mental production, so that the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are on the whole subject to it," (Marx, 1964, p. 67). These two observations, have led to the assumption that religion, an element of the superstructure, reflects the ideas and ideologies of the ruling class. Althusser (1977), for instance, argues that the Ideological State Apparatus (ISA) which includes the religious institution, is the means by which the ruling class maintains its hegemony. The close relationship between religious views and ruling ideology, as well as that between religious leaders and the members of the ruling class, has a long history. This historical unity led Marx to doubt that Christianity could break with the past, even with the establishment of the Christian Socialist Party. Religion, contends Marx even when it seeks to be revolutionary, retains its support for the elite because it is based on traditional ideas. Thus Christian Socialism, writes Marx, will continue to serve the ruling elite; ". . . as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism. Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priests consecrate the heartburning of the aristocrats" (Marx and Engels, 1958 p. 89). From this perspective, acceptance of the church's theological doctrines will more likely also lead to the acceptance of the ruling class ideology (which includes the belief in an unquestioned loyalty to the ruling elite). The support religion provides for the ruling elite is twofold. First, religious institutions frequently disseminate and justify an ideology which serves the interest of the ruling class. Second, they tend to support and legitimate the power position occupied by the elite. (This type of support, for instance, is well exemplified in Wesley's declara- tion "None of us shall either in writing or in conversation speak irreverently of the government" [Hill, p. 189]). One of the mechanisms through which the church induces loyalty to the ruling elite and reduces dissension, contends Marx, is the enhancement of false con- sciousness (see Marx, 1964, Ch. I).2 False consciousness is achieved through religious transvaluation, that is, through compensatory substitution for a lack of political power (see Glock and Stark, 1965, p. 250), so that the interests of the ruling class, and loyalty to them and their ideals, are safeguarded by theologically defined rules. The tie between the established religion and the ruling elite has been observed to exist not only in modern societies but also in preliterate societies. This association, as both Durkheim (1947) and Stark (1966) have argued, is rooted in and arises out of the idea of the sacred ruler. Durkheim, for instance, comments "The destiny of the State, was closely bound up with the fate of the gods worshiped at its altars. If the state suffers reverses, then the prestige of its gods declined in the same measure-and vice versa" (Quoted in Ernest Wallwork, 1972, p. 106). In a survey of both primitive and archaic religions Stark (1966) points out the ubiquity of the idea of the sacred ruler. The ruler is considered to be sacred because (1) he is considered to be a God himself, or because (2) he is considered a representative of God or his steward. In short, the ruler is sacred because he is the possessor of</page><page sequence="3">180 charisma through his association with the deity (Stark p. 24-25). One might argue that the political separation of church and state in this country has split this ancient unity, but the presence of the civil religion belies this assertion (see Bellah, 1967). In spite of the political separation of church and state, the nation is still conceived as a sacred entity, and the president thus assumes some of the characteristics common to the loyalty toward any sacred person or institution. CONCEPTS The multidimensionality of religion need not be reiterated here and can be taken as a given. While Glock and Stark's "5-d's" are most frequently used as the benchmark, the most salient of those five are religious belief and practice.3 These two dimensions, which are in themselves complex phenomena, have often been used as indices of religiosity. Belief, like religion as a whole, is multidimensional. Glock and Stark (1965, p. 24) suggest that this dimension contains three distinct subdimensions which they identify as warranting, purposive, and implementing beliefs. "Warranting belief" focuses on the existence of a deity and in previous re- searches has been measured by the respondent's indication of the strength of his/ her belief in the existence of a deity. This aspect of the belief dimension is reflected in the certainty of one's belief in the existence of God.4 There is, however, another aspect to the belief dimension, an element which has been absent in past re- searches, and that is the ontological feature of belief, that is, to the image of the God in which the respondents believe. While two people may be equal in the certainty of their belief, they may differ in their conceptions of the nature of the deity. In content this belief dimension ranges from the anthropomorphic pole, i.e. a view in which the respondents agree that God is best described in human qualities, a god who watches over all that he has created, to the other pole where the respondents agree that God is nothing but the sum of all the laws of physics. In addition to these poles the two other images of God which are commonly held are God as an intelligent force with a will and power, and the other which describes God as a natural force. One other dimension of the warranting belief is religious orthodoxy. Orthodoxy refers to the acceptance of and commitment to traditional elements of belief which in Christianity is reflected in one's belief in Jesus. "Purposive belief" includes those views associated with transvaluation in reli- gion, i.e., those providing alternative and transcendental goals which divert a person's concern for this worldly goals. In content this belief dimension includes a belief in life after death and in the existence of a reward system. The third subdimension is "implementing belief" which according to Glock and Stark, includes religious norms and values which define one's relationship to God and other people. Two such values which are central to religion are love and justice. While both values are important, not all religions stress both values equally. Love as a value, for instance, is more dominant in Christianity, while justice predomi- nates in Judaism (see Schoenfeld, 1974). The relationship between this belief dimension and politics was elaborated in an earlier paper (Schoenfeld, 1974) where it was suggested that a greater emphasis on love will be associated with political conservatism, and an emphasis on justice with political liberalism.</page><page sequence="4">181 METHODS Data for this research were collected by means of questionnaires administered to 404 students at six different universities in several states. The present paper is based on a part of that data. Although the sample is surely not representative of the population in general, and perhaps not even of the student population, there is enough variation in race, sex, socioeconomic status, and religious preference to make meaningful analysis possible.5 Measures Warranting belief was measured by three separate scales. First it was measured by the respondent's certainty of the existence of God. This belief scale consists of five items ranging from an indication of a definite belief in God's existence to disbelief.6 The measure of ontological belief subdimension consisted of four items. Respondents were asked to indicate which of four given descriptions of God best fits with their view. Finally the orthodoxy scale consists of five items ranging from a statement which described Jesus as the Son of God to the other pole which stated that such a person never existed. Purposive belief was measured by a six-item scale by which the respondents indicated their view of life after death. The statements ranged from acceptance of reincarnation to disbelief in life after death. Implementing belief was measured by the respondents, religious value orienta- tion, we asked each person to select, from among nine different statements, those three which best indicated his/her point of view. The statements reflected biblical concepts of love or that of justice. Following the logic of the Twenty Statements Test, we assigned a value of three (3) to the first selected value, two (2) to the second selected value, and one (1) to the last selected value. The range of scores totaled from six to zero for each value. Practice Under "practice" we include all aspects of religious behavior, such as church attendance, frequency of prayer, and ritual performance. The religious dimension of practice was measured by frequency of church attendance, praying and ritual performance. In short, under practice we include participation in and performance of religiously prescribed activities. Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven item scale the frequency of his/her church attendance which ranged from every day to never. Respondents were also asked to indicate on a seven item scale how often, if at all, they prayed. They were also to indicate how often they prayed before going to sleep (four items), how frequently they read the Bible (five items), and how frequently they said grace before meals (five items). Loyalty To measure the dependent variable-loyalty to the Presidency-each person was asked to indicate on a four-item Likert type scale the extent of his/her agreement with the following statement: "Regardless of one's political views, each American owes complete loyalty to the President of the United States." It was our intention</page><page sequence="5">182 that the responses to this statement will indicate the extent to which the respondents believe that loyalty to the presidency (not to the incumbent president) is normative and binding under any and all conditions. DATA ANALYSIS Data were analyzed by means of regression using the simultaneous inclusion techniques. This statistical technique is designed to make each variable act as a statistical control on other variables. Thus, each coefficient indicates the indepen- dent affect the independent variable exercises on the dependent variable. In addi- tion to the various measures of religiosity we have also included demographic and socio-economic variables in the regression equation and thus increasing statistical control. With this statistical technique we hope to maximize our understanding of the extent to which religious variables alone affect the variation in the respondents loyalties to the presidency. The present analysis of the data will be limited to two areas. Our first concern will be with the more general question of the relationship between religion and loyalty. Second, we shall also investigate the extent to which the influence of religion on loyalty varies with social class. As we noted above, the dominant ideology theory holds that religion is one of the mechanisms by which loyalty to the ruling elite is enhanced among the lower classes (see Abercrombie and Turner, 1980). Thus it should follow that the subordinate classes, which in this research are defined as "blue collar classes," should be more responsive to religious variables in general and to those which are designated as "transvaluative variables" in particular. Thus, variations of loyalty among blue collar people should then be more affected by church attendance and belief in life after death than variations among white collar respondents. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION The central question which this research examined was: To what extent do religious belief and behavior influence the strength of loyalty to the U.S. Presi- dency? Our purpose was, as we stated earlier, to examine the thesis that religion tends to induce among its adherents a sense of loyalty to the power elite. Data in Table 1 present both standardized and unstandarized regression coefficients be- tween religious and non-religious variables and one's expressed sense of loyalty to the President. The total of all explained variation of loyalty, including all the independent variables is 25.4 percent. Of this percentage, religious variables alone explain 17.1 percent of the variation. Clearly then, when compared with demo- graphic and SES variables, religious variables have greater explanatory power. At the same time, it must be noted that the data were gathered from a relatively homogeneous population, and that this in itself will decrease the variation; still, religious variables far exceeded non-religious variables in their explanatory power. Further examination of the data in Table 1 reveal that the impact of religious variables on loyalty is not unidirectional. Indeed, two sets of religious variables exert a diametrically opposing influence on the respondents' loyalty to the Presi- dency. On the one hand, strength of belief in God, religious orthodoxy, and ritual behavior tend to be associated with an increase in loyalty, while prayer, on the other hand, tends to be associated with a decrease in loyalty. Our data further show that</page><page sequence="6">183 Table 1 STANDARDIZED, UNSTANDARDIZED AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FOR LOYALTY MEASURES REGRESSED ON BACKGROUND AND RELIGIOUS VARIABLES Background Variables All Variables Beta B Beta B Race .237* ( .456) .247* ( .056) [ .127] [ .119] Age -.120* (-.024) -.095 (-.019) [ .013] [ .012] Sex -.074 (-.122) .022 ( .003) [ .098] [ .093] SES -.060 (-.002) -.064 (-.002) [ .002] [ .002] Marital Status .007 ( .020) .021 ( .057) [ .172] [ .158] Religious Activity .190* ( .175)* [ .067] Prayer -.199 (-.172)* [ .065] Orthodoxy .273* ( .218)* [ .054] Belief in After Life .058* ( .035) [ .039] Belief in God .146* ( .126)* [ .060] Anthroporphism -.081 (-.094)* [ .068] Commitment to Justice .125* ( .072) [ .036] R2 .066 .254* N=269 Numbers in () = unstandardized regression, [] = standard errors.

Prayer (which includes Bible reading and bedtime prayer), on the other hand, is the one religious variable which is significantly associated with lack of loyalty. This dichotomy may indeed reflect previous observations that religion both supports and opposes those in power. The fact that increased fre- quency of praying tends to be associated with less support for those in power may give a clue to the nature of association between religion and political power.</page><page sequence="7">184 To explain this finding let us begin by observing that the dichotomy between prayer and the other religious variables seems to reflect the dichotomy observed by Luckman between institutional church religion and individual (or privatized) reli- gion. These two types of religions differ chiefly in the extent to which the adherent is committed to a world view provided by the collectivity. In church religion, one's world view and religious picture are defined ideologically by the religious expert and are most often associated with the general political world view. On the other hand, in individual religion (which Luckman [1967] considers to be dominant in modern society), these are "mediated neither through a specialized domain of religious institutions nor through other primary public institutions" (103). Luck- man considers the latter form of religion primarily revolving around individual's needs and feelings. In this form, obviously, religion fails to provide a collective model for thought and thus ceases to be an integrative force or a legitimator and supporter of the symbolic leader of the collective. While the negative association between prayer and loyalty to the presidency may reflect and be rooted in our greater commitment to the "private sphere" and its concomitant individual religion, it may on the other hand also reflect differences which are inherent in the religious dichotomy of prophetic and priestly religions. The distinction between the priest and the prophet is that the first lays claim to his legitimacy on service and tradition and the latter on personal revelation. (Weber 1963, p. 46) The distinctiveness between the two is so great that "almost no prophets have emerged from the priestly class." (Weber 1963, p. 46) Associated with these two roles are also differences in religious orientations and observances. Let us now examine these two roles. The priest whose religious role is centered in service is more likely to emphasize the development of the "organized church" to include structured religious service with an emphasis on attendance and ritual observation. In essence the religion associated with the priestly role is very similar to Luckman's description of the "church religion." Church religion led by the priest stresses religious behavior which is rooted in the collective and as a consequence reinforces the collective and has meaning only within the collective. (See Durkheim, 1947.) The priestly reli- gion and the church thus serve the interest of the collective and its symbol-the ruler. No wonder, therefore, that this form of religion has been identified as being the handmaiden of the power elite because it provides the mechanism by which the ruling ideology is disseminated and thereby provides for social control. The church also legitimates the power of the ruling elite as well as its attendant social class system by making its own structure mirror the secular order.7 In addition, the adherents subservience to the ruling elite is enhanced by the routinization of religious behavior with the inclusion of systematic prayer and periodic rituals. These acts we propose lead to behavioral predictability and control. In contrast to the priests, the prophets and the religious order associated with them deemphasize organization in favor of a more unstructured religion. Instead of the routinized prayer of the prayer book (which in essence is a form of ritual), prophetic religions emphasize spontaneous prayer which by its very nature is less predictable and hence uncontrolled. The praying individual who follows a role established and emphasized by charismatic tradition associated with the prophets recognizes no other authority other than God, accepts no other entity to whom he/ she is subordinated other than the deity. Prayer, that is the spontaneous personal utterances even when performed with the collective remains a private and individ-</page><page sequence="8">185 ual religious act. This prayer, in contrast to prayer book statement, is a form of interaction between the individual and the deity. While ritual is concerned with and directed toward collective ends and needs (such as the need for rain or for collective health), prayers address private needs (individual illness or other individual prob- lems). In this sense prayer serves a function similar to that which magic has served in more primitive societies (see Malinowski, 1948). Bypassing the collectivity, the praying individual instead makes an attachment directly with the deity. As a consequence, we propose, prayers also eliminate attachment to political function- aries and reduce one's attachment to the "official" point of view. One who prays seeks answers to his ultimate concerns not through the collective and its leaders but directly from the deity. Since God, rather than humans, is perceived to be the sole possessor of knowledge about and answers to ultimate problems, prayer perhaps reinforces a skeptical view of human capabilities. Trust in other humans would thus be minimized, and the praying individual would be more likely to follow the biblical dictum: "Put no trust in princes, in mortal man who can give no help" (Psalms 146:2). These findings reinforce earlier findings which reported an associ- ation between religiosity and distrust of other humans (see Schoenfeld, 1978). The present data suggest that this distrust of humans arises not out of religiosity in general but from a specific emphasis on prayer and an attachment to the deity instead of the collectivity. Our expectation that a greater commitment to justice will be associated with a decrease in loyalty has not been realized. The data in fact indicate an opposite relationship (see Table 1). While the relationship as indicated in Table 1, is statistically significant at the .05 level, the relationship needs to be further ex- plored. An analysis of the relationship using a Pearsionian r shows that a commit- ment to justice, in contrast to love, has a significant and more than moderate negative relationship with belief (r = -.286), religious activity (-.371), and prayer (-.403). In short, among Christian students a greater religious commitment tends to be associated, as expected, with a greater emphasis on love rather than justice. Some of the implications of this relationship have already been developed else- where (Schoenfeld, 1974). Finally, the data also show that an anthropomorphic view of God seems not to be associated with a greater rate of loyalty than other views. But the lack of relationship here is most likely due to the relative absence of variation in this religious dimension.8 The second problem we investigated is the interactive effect of class and religion on loyalty to the Presidency. We suggested that religion, as a carrier of the dominant culture, will exercise a greater influence upon loyalty to the Presidency among members of the subordinate blue collar classes than it will among those in white collar classes. The nature of our sample will not permit us a true test of the above hypotheses since all of our respondents are college students and thus form a somewhat homogeneous group. Still, we propose that some residual parental influence will remain and that some class influence, if it is as significant as we assume it to be, will be noticeable. Data in Table 2 compare the relationship between both religious and non-religious variables and loyalty, holding parental class constant. The data show no great or significant differences between the two subsamples. First, for the most part there is no evidence that those from blue collar backgrounds have stronger beliefs regarding life after death, so that the impact of transvaluation on political beliefs among students from either class background is minimal. The only difference the data show is that religious activity has a slightly</page><page sequence="9">186 Table 2 ZERO ORDER CORRELATION AND BETA VALUES FOR RELIGIOUS AND NON RELIGIOUS VARIABLES AND LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT White-Collar Blue-Collar Independent Variables r Beta r Beta Race .06 .14* .36 .32* Age -.20 -.18* -.01 -.01 Sex -.09 -.02 -.03 .03 Married -.02 .07 -.04 .02 Conservative .27 .13 .24 .12 Religious Activity .21 .12* .39 .38* Prayer -.13 -.21* .06 -.15 Orthodoxy .32 .29* .27 .21* After-Life .19 .07 .15 .03 Belief in God .29 .17 .23 .07 Anthropomorphism -.05 -.08 .15 -.04 Justice .00 .13 -.06 .06 R2 = .245 R2 = .303 greater impact on loyalty among respondents from blue collar backgrounds. This difference is not due to religious behavioral differences, since the mean and standard deviation of religious behavior for both groups is similar. Thus we must assume that this difference is indeed due to class-related factors. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION This research sought to investigate the relation between religion and loyalty to the U.S. presidency. Data have shown that while collective practices which can be identified as "church religion" tend to support such loyalty, prayer has the opposite effect. Moreover, there is some evidence which indicates that "church religion," or collective religious practice, has a greater effect upon loyalty among blue collar class. Let us now turn and examine the implications our findings have on the study of the sociology of religion. Clearly, given the nature of our data and the limitations imposed by them any interpretation of the findings must be taken as hypothesis and suggested direction for further studies. The relationship between religion and politics as we have observed earlier is not clear. Wuthnow (1973) reports that of the 266 articles reporting the findings of their studies on religion and politics only 36 percent have found the expected relationship, namely, a positive association be-</page><page sequence="10">187 tween religiosity and conservatism. Similarly on a number of occasions, religion instead of supporting the power elite has been in the forefront of revolutions. (Lewy, 1974) Clearly then, there are some elements in religion which do not bind the individual to the dominant culture and do not instill loyalty to the ruling elite, but to the contrary, free the individual from the social bonds and social constraints. Our data suggest that praying serves this function and that prayer stands in a dialectical relationship with the organized and routinized activities performed within and through the church. In short, we propose that praying does not bind the individual to the collective, does not provide for the social cohesion a function which has been attributed to religion, but, instead frees the praying individual, in the same manner as the charismatic leader is freed from the dictates of social custom and norms. The sole arbiter of morality which guides the behavior of the praying individual are not social values incorporated in the dominant culture, but his own interpretation of God's will. By becoming subservient to God and to society the praying individual is the true inner directed person who is guided by personal principles as determined by his/her interpretation of God's will. But since prayers and the images people have of God vary, their impact on loyalty will also vary. It therefore is important that future researchers place greater importance on examining the nature and content of prayers and the variations of people's perceptions of God. A clearer understanding of these two important features of religion will enhance our knowledge of the impact of religious exercises on political life. NOTES 'Revision of a paper presented at the International Meeting of Sociology of Religion, London, August, 1983. 2This views has been expanded by Lenin, who in his interpretation of Marx writes: Marxism considers all modern religions and churches, each and every religious organiza- tion, in all cases organs of bourgeois reaction which protect exploitation and serve to befuddle the working class. (Quoted in Irving Fetscher, 1971, p. 271.) 3Factor analysis of the data revealed that there were two distinct constructs of religious practice operating: (1) that of religious participation, which includes church attendance, social participation in the church, and ritual (i.e., the saying of grace), and (2) that of prayer, which includes frequency of prayer, Bible reading and prayer at bedtime. (Electronic prayer participation was very infrequent among these respondents and hence was eliminated from analysis.) 4The measures of certainty of belief, life after death, and religious orthodoxy were taken from the questionnaires on "Perspectives on Life in Todays World" conducted by The Survey Research Center University of California, Berkley. 51 mean here that just like in ancient Greece life in the community was considered to reflect life on Olympus and therefore was considered to be legitimate, so the class structure and the hierarchal system of the ruling power is considered legitimate because it reflects the social order of the church. For an additional perspective on this relationship see Glock (1972). 6Respondents were students from Georgia State University, University of Maryland, University of Connecticut, University of Houston, Texas Tech and University of Nevada. Mean age was 20.9. The sample consisted of 59.6 percent women. 80 percent of the sample were white and 14.9 percent were black. 7The distribution of responses here are as follows (of those responding to this question): 162 (or 44.8 percent) accepted an anthropomorphic view of God, 47 (13 percent) defined God as a non-human intelligence, 30 (8.0 percent) as the sum of natural forces, 4 (1.1 percent) as the sum of laws of physics and 119 (32.9 percent) as others (non-specified).
