(Baker 1993, 6).1 Emerging forays into animal theory are as profuse as those concerning the history of comics, the semiotics of the comics medium, or the new sub- jectivities (complex assemblages of author, protagonist, and reader) fetishized by the most popular graphic narratives today Despite the exhaustive sweep of Ian Gordon or David Kunzle's historical examinations of funny animal comics, however, very little scholarship exists that casts the animal of the comics in the dawning theoretical light of concepts known variously as ani- mality, becoming-animal, or animetaphor.2 This essay is intended as a pre- liminary contribution toward filling that void. The graphic novels I analyze here have been selected not only for their thematic and theoretical propen- sities, but for the way they also map the global dimensions of graphic novel production, spanning different national literatures to perform the animal in distinct, yet overlapping sub-genres - humor, trauma, and kunstlerroman. It is not my intention to read these genres or the pictorial structure of graphic novels reductively through the prism of animal theory Rather, I want to cul- tivate a porous border between creative texts and theoretical lenses, explor- ing their mutual implication in order to show how they together articulate a model of identity that prioritizes a proximate but affectless other - a type of species presence that unmoors the social from those spatial relationalities that dominate graphic narrative. And as we shall see, as species propinquity replaces social norms of anatomical and emotional similarity, the shadow of death looms above each of the animal deployments studied here. The Animal in the Comics Before signifying anything so depressing as death writ large, the animal referenced in comics is more generally a ludic cipher of otherness. Its appear- ance almost always accompanies the strategic and parodic veiling of the human. The illustrative style of such comics has much to do with the way this process of defamiliarization works, and we must not forget that the pri- mary mode of representation in them is never simply language - with its conceptual relations between signifer and signified - but pictures, which bear an indexical or perceptual relation to the things they represent. For literary critics, therefore, the proverbial one thousand words of a picture's worth may grandly fail to express the semantic value of even the most mundane of pic- tures. Imagine how much greater the failure when the picture at issue is a sequential irregularity, a trick rhythm in the imagistic textures of graphic nar-</page><page sequence="3">Michael A. Chaney 131 rative. An example of such an anomaly appears in Ho Che Anderson's King , a graphic novel biography of Martin Luther King Jr. At key moments of crisis, Anderson's characters appear feral. They bare their teeth like wild animals or else like skulls, human heads suddenly caught in the flash of an X-ray (see Figures 1&amp;2). Rarely do these teeth-bared pan- els exist in sequence, occurring mostly in single panels that disrupt an oth- erwise normative pattern of, more or less, realistic depictions of the 1960s Civil Rights movement. What is most disturbing, perhaps even Gothic, about this tic of the illustrator's hand is the deliberate brevity of these moments that obtrude upon the real so as to signal both a momento mori and a momento bestie of human existence. As if to say, "Remember Thou Art Mortal," the inter- ruptive insertion of these toothy scenes of aggression also beckons, "Remember Thou Art Animal." But toward whom is the warning directed? To King, Anderson's readers or both? Like some impossible cross between academic biography, Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors , and Edgar Allen Poe's "Berenice," King reveals dream logics of death and drive in these rare snap- shots of the grotesque, yet it does so irresolvably, as if the unreadable were the point rather than anything specific about the reverend doctor. What contin- ues to perplex long after our initial confrontation with these odd scenes of naturalistic expression is a nagging question about the typicality of such moments in sequential art. Does not the animal often function as the semi- otic talisman in comics for broaching such questions of representation and its limits? Beyond the comic tradition's fascination with funny animal stories, these eruptions in King and other graphic narratives demonstrate how the process of "becoming animal" underwrites even those comics that have seemingly no investment whatever in the fable and its derivatives, the talk- ing-animal story traditions.3 Nevertheless, comics today always in some measure signal their association with this earlier fable-indebted strain. Having always had one figurative foot in the domain of children's liter- ature, comics routinely partake in that fabular preoccupation with talking animals, humans that become animal, and humans that interact with magical, humanoid animals. All of this manifests at the level of the story, that is, in terms of character and plot, but it also occurs at the visual level, where any of the panels of such a comic could be seen individually as representing an animal-human hybridity. But even at this level, where visual markers consti- tuting the human mesh with those that normally constitute the non-human, we should be wary of employing a term so loaded as hybridity. As my point in this essay will be to encourage our exercising a critical suspicion regard- ing the seemingly automatic gestures of trans-species democracy available in such representations, I would like here to point out how seldom it is that one sees a comics representation of a talking or magical quadruped that actually</page><page sequence="4">132 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1 1 walks on all fours. There is a limit to all of this hybridity, in other words, which casts the animal, not surprisingly, at the vanishing point of the human, but which does so time and again in order to finally celebrate and naturalize the superiority of the human (as defined by the Enlightenment) as well as the insuperable difference separating the human from the non-human. To be sure, rampant visual distortion makes the comics form seem to be composed of libratory amendments to the totalizing sovereignty usually accorded to the human. Rather than reading the human body as it is, we are often called upon in the comics to view and imagine it as dramatically other than it is. But this reading protocol of inversion is precisely also the origin of the rad- ically conservative politics behind visual distortion. To see, experience, and to some extent to feel the surreal in, say, the bestial tail of the girl in Charles Burns s Black Hole , or the dizzying array of background clutter that comes to life in Julie Doucet's My NewYork Diary , is to have to keep in mind a Platonic image of the ideal all the while. It is this visual norm that gets reinforced because it need never be visualized. By operating invisibly behind the dis- tortions we do see, the distorted illustration works to constantly reinforce the singularity of a negated ideal that we do not see. The animalized human body is visually legible and fictively pleasing, therefore, precisely because it is nei- ther legible nor pleasing in relation to the norm or to the "real" that the comic fantastically suspends yet constantly and invisibly produces as an essen- tial effect of that suspension. That the animal mask acords the fabulist a valuable measure of metaphorical distance is a notion that required neither difficult theories of mimesis nor elaborate critiques of the human for early twentieth-century critics and readers to comprehend. What Gilbert Seldes says of George Herriman's Krazy Kat in 1924 - that "it is Herriman's bent to disguise what he has to say in the creations of the animal worlds which are neither human nor animal, but each sui generis" (2005, 23) - continues to be a point of near- ly obvious significance to cite regarding the use of animal characters in var- ious literatures. On African oral literatures containing shape-shifting magical animals, for example, Ruth Finnegan explains that such devices portray "human faults and virtues, somewhat removed and detached from reality through being presented in the guise of animals, but nevertheless with an indirect relation to observed human action" (1970, 351). A similar interpre- tation is so common as to be an axiom of children's literature, in which ani- mal representations echo earlier traditions of the fable, myth, and fairy tale. One effect of this hearkening back to primitive culture is that the device of animal representation becomes in itself a signifier of children - those cultur- al primitives among us for whom Western theology's insistence on the sub- ject-object disparity between man (Adam) and animal does not apply. The</page><page sequence="5">Michael A. Chaney 133 point is that children are not simply more like the primitive in our imagi- nary understanding of those earlier subjects of culture, who may have truly believed in shape-shifting animals as part of a pantheistic ideology for instance, but that they are more like the primitive who would have seen him or herself as occupying a more proximate position to the animal as well. And in being only temporarily susceptible to such fantasy, the child further safe- guards the Active certainty in the superiority of our conventional adult notions about the absolute difference between the animal and human. Even so, literature associated with the child and animal representation more gen- erally leaves open the possibility that these certainties have not yet crystal- lized. To read them is to reserve a space for conceptual amalgamations whose time is figuratively up, but never quite yet as we read. Those of us who teach comics know all too well how difficult it is for others - even in the academy - to associate narratives that tell stories through drawings with anything other than juvenilia of one kind or another. The underground comix of the 1960s, their preoccupation with sex and naked- ness notwithstanding, continue to depend upon a juvenile orientation towards the world from this cynically narrow perspective. Thus resistant to maturity the comics are uniquely suited to representing what early anthro- pology defined as liminality, the condition of being on the boundary par excellence, in the penumbra between youth and adulthood. Of course, we now have so many more sensitive labels for such a condition, and all of its permutations and interstitial manifestations, which comics are no less apt in conveying. There is the transculturality Rocio Davis sees in Persepolis , the post-memory Marianne Hirsch sees in Maus , the mestiza consciousness Melinda de Jesus sees in One Hundred Demons , and all the forms of hybridi- ty that Hillary Chute and Marianne DeKoven see in the comics form more generally. All of these concerns with being in-between are themselves artic- ulated at a boundary of identity and representation. That paradox is best expressed in the way comics routinely problematize the human by blurring the ontological boundary between humans and animals according to the same logic that both fuses and separates words and pictures. That paradox is further resonant in another division that ramifies comics, no matter how irk- some it is to comics scholars, which imagines the exclusion of child(ish) readers from the domain of serious literature. Nevertheless, by calling attention to themselves as constructed represen- tations, early comics juvenilia, such as the funny animal comics of Krazy Kat , may be seen as locating being in terms akin to Deleuze and Guattari's notion of becoming - in a zone "that makes it impossible to say where the bound- ary between the human and animal lies" (1987, 273). Herriman's strip in par- ticular accomplishes something along these lines in the way that it troubles</page><page sequence="6">134 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1 ] conventions (which signal reason and thus the human), replacing cliches of species enmity with radical amity (which could figure in the binary as a kind of animality), and in allowing the framework of its mimesis to come crash- ing down Babel-like on itself. The deconstructive precocities of Herriman's strip have been noted by critics in its own day (since the 1910s) and in ours. But I would like to suggest that within the context of the newspaper as a whole, the weird, unpredictable gags of Krazy and Ignatz and Offica Pup find a conservative closure on the other side of the strip's amazing finesse at artic- ulating the animal. The weird in the strip safeguards the serious and the rational that encloses it, making the comic an enclave of inversion that always, to some extent, works to reinstate the norms it so reliably, yet tem- porarily, overturns. While this larger betrayal of the comics' fantasy may be leveled against any type of fiction, comics seem particularly haunted by this earlier commercial dependence upon an enfolding regime of popular mid- dle-class notions of the serious that once made them a desirable entertain- ment of contrast in early newspapers. The animal-human hybridizations prevalent in graphic novels today, in fact, tend to assume a self-conscious air about their visual infractions against the serious (anthropomorphic), wryly combining the animal and the human visually in such a way as to ultimate- ly (and desultorily in many cases) re-post the human as the undisputed sub- ject of authority. Both because and in spite of its infinitely pliable surfaces, the human is made over in comics that make overtures to human-animal combinations as the unmitigated, unadulterated ground of significance and signification, a pure Subject after the fact of its vulgar and often-comic visu- al slumming in the comics. For example, in Charles Burns's Black Hole we see again this paradox of subversion via animality 's alternative cognition and the eventual cooptation of that subversion through the comics form. Here the paradox plays out against a backdrop of sex according to a familiar binary of vision versus touch, which functions thematically in the graphic novel as dual modes of reading or of knowledge production. Emphasized throughout Burns's weird visual tale of two libidinal teens is the proposition that the eroticized zone of the human's tangible body may be best visualized in a comic through surre- al extensions of the body proper, so that the heroine of the text has what appears to be a tail. This tail doubles, of course, as a kind of penis in illustra- tions of her naked body alongside her male partner, who possesses a vagina with teeth on his chest. The queering of the body thus produced helps to construct a comic that celebrates not the objective ocular perception so val- ued by the art-historical tradition of the still-life painting, for example, but a knowledge of protean contingency, available to tenable exploration but never wholly known by perception at all. Nevertheless, the comic is primarily a</page><page sequence="7">Michael A. Chaney 135 visual document. It projects its fantasy of a carnal knowledge mediated by touch according to the priorities of visual scripts that finally subsume any such thing as tactile sensuality into the performance of its own totalizing authority. To kindle the animal therefore as both a new mode of reading (through touch) and as an emergent visual variation on the human body (the image of the girl's tail) is to endorse a supposedly obsolete notion of the human as supreme author of a knowledge that is primarily mediated as a visual epistemology. The animal in such comics always functions as mask or costume, beneath which lies the human, whose universality is reaffirmed and reified in the process. We may attend closely to the way in which this reification happens and to the temporarily radical forms of knowledge that it both supplants and fails to eradicate in two prominent examples of human-animal combinations: Gene Luen Yang's American Born Chinese and David Beauchard's Epileptic American Born Chinese and the Monkey Double The recipient of five prestigious "Best Book of the Year" awards, Gene Luen Yang's American Born Chinese draws on traditional Chinese folklore and contemporary US pop culture for its dramatis bestiary : the Monkey King, angsty high-schooler Jin Wang, and Chin-Kee, an incarnation of "Yellow Peril" era racism. If the 'talking animal comic' represents what we might call the primary phase of animal tropology in the comics, Yang's text occupies a secondary phase. This is not a tale told through animal types, but one that finally celebrates transformations of identity by way of creaturely alterity. Put another way, Yang's characters become not simply other than what they are, but the other that they are. True to its titular play on exiled, split, and doubled identity, American Born Chinese theorizes the constitutive interplay of insider and outsider that characterizes the "funny animal" comic strip as well as autobiographical graphic novels. The plot braids together three initially different heroes, each corresponding to a distinct narrative modality, medium, and milieu: the Monkey King (Chinese mythology), Jin Wang (coming-of-age, assimilation narrative), and Danny (TV situation comedy in the vein of "The Odd Couple" complete with specialized panel border of "HaHaHaHa" - the comic equivalent of a laugh track). All are embattled outcasts who "transform themselves from self-negation to self-acceptance" (Fu 2007, 276). In keeping with the myth, Yang's Monkey King is a pariah among the gods of Heaven, who snub his brutish nature in spite of his powerful magic.4 Dejected, the Monkey King returns to his royal chamber (see Figure 3), where a "thick smell of monkey fur greeted him [that] he'd never noticed before" (Yang 2006, 20). As with so many other animated characters, the ani-</page><page sequence="8">136 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1] mal mask functions according to a principle of juxtaposition to intensify the pathos of the moment, if only because of the animal's ordinary exclusion from pathos. Is it not central to the juxtaposition inherent to comics that the animal would reinforce, even while countermanding, philosophy's recurring trope of the sadness of animals, poor in this world (a la Heidegger) because alien to spirit and affect? As with any funny animal comic, this scene tanta- lizes in part by exacerbating philosophical anxieties regarding the animal's obscure gaze, which, for Agamben, "always seems to be on the verge of utter- ing words" (1995, 113). And similar to the allure of the Tunny animal' comic book that Joseph Witek ascribes to a "curious indifference to the animal nature of the characters" (1989, 109), the Monkey King operates less as an allegorical animal than as a metaphorical minority. When scenes and characters are at their most cartoonish in American Born Chinese , viewers would do well to grow suspicious. Yang's parable of self-acceptance is told through a distorted lens that projects internalized stereotypes as optic truths. Recalling the theme ofToni Morrison's The Bluest Eye (1970) and the plot of David Henry Hwang's drama FOB (1979), Jin Wang's narrative centers on his attempts at interracial dating, spurred on by an early childhood fascination for Transformer robots (an unsubtle objective correlative) and his emerging friendship with F.O.B (slang for "Fresh-off- the-boat") Wei-Chen. Forlorn because of his unreciprocated crush on the white Amelia, Jin Wang fixates on the curly blonde hair of the boy Amelia frequently accompanies. After Amelia is trapped in an animal storage area of the biology classroom with Wei-Chen, who shares a bizarre affinity with one of the monkeys, the stage is set for Jin Wang and Amelia to date. Jin alters his hair to reflect the curls he believes Amelia admires in others and experiences an arc of electric confidence, ironically visualized by a recurring icon of lightening bolts that curve precisely along Jin's imitation curls. Whereas Jin Wang is drawn, for the most part, so as to reflect the object of his rejection, his Taiwanese identity, Danny is shown in his narrative to be not just white, but to embody the very type of blonde, spikey-haired white- ness elsewhere valorized as an ideal unattainable to Asian characters. Satirizing the television cliche of the wacky buddy scenario, Danny's Asian difference is externalized in the figure of a visiting cousin from China, Chin- Kee. (see Figure 4). Danny's embodied ideal inversely parallels Chin-Kee's hyper re-enactment of racist Asian stereotypes such that both are exposed as pasteboard constructions when all three storylines abruptly converge: Danny has been a psychic projection of Jin Wang's ideal self and Chin-Kee is really the Monkey King, having made flesh exactly what Jin- Wang abjects in him- self in order to prompt the youth toward self-reconciliation.</page><page sequence="9">Michael A. Chaney 137 American Born Chinese foregrounds animality and race (or animality as race) in its psychic splittings. Among the many turnabouts of identity, Jin learns that Wei-Chen is the son of the Monkey King and has been disguis- ing his simian form to live, as he puts it, "in the mortal world using it for my pleasure" (Yang 2006, 220). Rereading the graphic novel with this revelation in mind further compounds the bizarre humor of the earlier scene in the biology classroom's animal closet, where a monkey wearing lipstick and mas- cara constantly reaches out through its bars to seize hold of Wei-Chen. Inexplicably upon the first reading, he is able to detect the animal's male gen- der with certainty, much to the surprise and repugnance of Amelia who asks: "How do you know? On second thought, I don't really want to know the answer to that" (99). After not having seen Wei-Chen for some time, and eager to confront him about his true identity, the now reformed Jin Wang encoun- ters Wei-Chen, who has in the meantime modified the Asian features of his human avatar with accoutrements associated with hip-hop culture. At this point, the viewer is granted the vision to see the animal beneath its commod- ity disguise - the hip-hop regalia as well as the human form (see Figure 5). The viability in the panel layout of a recursive, rather than strictly sequential, reading order introduces a paradox.5 Is the middle panel merely the revelation in sepia of the true animal body of Wei-Chen, or is it anoth- er of Jin Wang's projections? A more expansive semiotic reading - which is always available in such comics - might eschew the mimetic demand that the monkey encode either character's imago. In other words, the monkey may serve to literally mediate Jin Wang and Wei-Chen as doubles of each other. Such a reading complicates the distinction that comics scholars impute to traditional beast fables when differentiating them from funny animal comics. In Comic Books as History Joseph Witek explains that in contrast to the alle- gorical characterization of animals in beast fables, which sets up inflexible correspondences between traits and animals that have come to embody such traits in a culture, the "funny animal" comic transcends allegory in its embrace of human typology.6 For Witek, the animal comic "takes these alle- gorical meanings as a starting point but then proceeds to ignore, qualify, or reverse them" (1989, 110) .Yang's inversion of the funny animal comic wreaks havoc with Witek's distinction. Neither anthropomorphic animals who act human nor visual human-animal hybrids, Yang's characters are funny animals disguised as humans, making cameo appearances in a cartoon universe pred- icated on the human form - a situation that is more typical of the autobio- graphical graphic novels under review here. To compound our inquiry of American Born Chinese , we might go on to ask what Chin-Kee and the Monkey King have to do with Wei-Chen's optic traversals of identities eth- nic, mythic, and animal? Yang's comic clearly has a lesson in mind for read-</page><page sequence="10">138 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1 ] er-viewers at this moment of animal pedagogy, if only we can discern the proper curriculum. Because the animal in question is the monkey, even the most rigid cor- respondences of allegorical representation are pressed into the service of sub- stitution: mutability, and other effects associated not only with monkey trick- sters but with metaphor as well. Yang's monkey functions, as does the African trickster, to destabilize boundaries between cosmic orders of being and comes to embody, as Henry Louis Gates has famously shown, "the process of interpretation itself" (1988, 17). Adapting Gates, John Lowe argues that trick- sters based on the myth of the Monkey King serve to "'loosen' knowledge by the way they shake the established order, frequently through their irrev- erent humor and by the way in which that humor points to the irreconcil- able ambiguities of life, which in their absurdity create Freud's classic humor of juxtaposition of opposites" (1996, 105-06). Although Asian Studies folk- lorists have observed considerable overlap between African and Asian mythology on this score, the earliest Chinese adaptations of the Monkey King furnish meaningful clues for understanding Yang's most recent contri- bution to the tradition of Monkey King tales and their implicit meditations on the human-animal relation. Based on Chinese mythology of Tripitaka's journey to India to bring Buddhism back to China, the story of the Monkey King was published as a novel in the sixteenth century, The Journey to the West. Centuries of adapta- tions, however, have recalibrated focus away from the character of the monk to spotlight his Monkey disciple: "As a cultural icon, Monkey is loved as much for his rambunctious behavior in Heaven as for his maturation into a heroic Buddhist disciple."7 As seen in Maxine Hong Kingston's Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book (1990), Gerald Vizenor's Griever: An American Monkey King in China (1986), and Patricia Chao's Monkey King (1997), the Monkey King archetype of Promethean subversion has a long tradition of American adaptation. Many adaptors, like Yang, emphasize the first part of the Monkey's tale, of his profanations and subsequent fall before achieving enlightenment, as "a helpful template for their stories about what it takes to become healthy in the modern world" (Pearson 2006, 373). Even Yang's use of the multi-plot narrative mirrors the two-part organization of Journey to the West in which the extended prologue of the Monkey King's outrages in Heaven compress- es "motifs later developed, in a kind of parody of the enlightenment process" (Plaks 1987, 209). Yang's other intertextual touchstone is the tragic history of assimilation and difference in a US frame, highlighted in Wei-Chen's "gangsta" pose and, of course, in the terrifyingly funny antics of Chin-Kee. Yang himself explains his animal curriculum as a kind of visual matching-exercise in history: "With</page><page sequence="11">Michael A. Chaney 139 Chin-Kee, I attempted to tie today's popular images of Asians and Asian- Americans with the more overtly racist imagery prevalent in the late 1800s and early 1900s" (Yang 2007, 12). Even while, as Binbin Fu notes, Chin-Kee represents "the monkey's evil double" (275), he also imitates the posture, dress, and even dialogue of various, yet verifiable, antecedents of racist Asian iconog- raphy. In interviews Yang pinpoints Long Duk Dong, from John Hughes's film of the 1980s Sixteen Candles , and William Hung's ridiculed performance of "She Bangs" from American Idol in 2003 as templates for Chin-Kee, asserting that his comic images "draw on visual cues and shorthand already established in the mind of the audience" (13). Even those racialized characters that seem far removed from the signifying mechanics of the funny animal genre are not so different in semantic potential after all. For as the apotheosis of otherness, the animal is also a racial signifies 8 Yang's use of the double signifies on other literary works by Asian American authors exploring similar dilemmas of ethnic identity crisis. Sau- Ling Cynthia Wong's analysis of "the double that does justice to the unique- ness of the Asian American experience and its literary expressions" (1993, 86) mines the bedrock of denial lying beneath such literary expressions. According to Wong: The double is symptomatic of a crisis in self-acceptance and self-knowl- edge: part of the self, denied recognition by the conscious ego, emerges as an external figure exerting a hold over the protagonist that seems dis- proportionate to provocation or inexplicable by everyday logic. (Wong 1993, 82) Given Wong's criteria, we might dizzyingly conclude that the double of Jin is Danny, and that Danny's double is Chin-Kee, the double of the Monkey King. And while all of these doubled doubles symbolize "that residue of racial difference which dooms Chinese Americans to a position of inferiority in a racist society," the fact that so much of the doubling turns on the figure of the animal exhibits another layer of "psychological disowning" (1993, 89). To determine precisely what is disowned by the gaze of the double that is itself doubled by the animal is to pursue a question begged by countless graphic novels, so many, in fact, that the issue ultimately redounds to the visual nature of the medium itself. American Born Chinese exemplifies the graphic novel's inimitable capaci- ty to articulate visual systems for cognizing the human. And in this regard, the animal as a recurring trope of sequential art opens onto more than, as Witek puts it, "a generic space into a precivilized innocence in which human behavior is stripped down" (1989, 111). In Heidegger's phenomenology the animal opens onto a consideration of a world that envelops without directly impacting the animal's sense of Being. Commenting on Heidegger's animal,</page><page sequence="12">140 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1 ] Jacques Derrida writes: "the property unique to animals and what in the final analysis distinguishes them from man, is their being naked without knowing it" (2002, 373). In seeing Wei-Chen's "true" self, the animal's lack of clothing in the second panel betrays a surplus of clothing in the third. If it were nat- ural for the animal to be wearing anything other than fur, we might hardly notice how unnatural this surplus appears on Wei-Chen: the gold chains, flashy sunglasses, earrings, and pluming cigarette. The vivid interpolation of the animal prior to the scene of Wei-Chen ensconced in costuming facili- tates our ability to see the possibility for and the absurdity in his cross-racial performance of "gangsta" culture. Akin to the racial other but also pro- foundly (and perhaps problematically) more universal in its claim to other- ness, the animal occupies, as Derrida puts it, "a point of view of the absolute other," regarding the human from a position of "absolute alterity" (2002, 380). Thus, whereas Wei-Chen's revelation - as Wong might read the scene - measures the "radical dissonance between [his] flattering self-image and the rude reality of [his] inadequate qualifications for full membership in white society" (1993, 96), it also registers, in racial tones, his debarment from human community. Yang's tripartite tale achieves fairy-tale closure with another of pop cul- ture's infatuations with Asian American assimilative performance taken as comedy: Jin Wang and Wei-Chen singing together on a digital video. The single panel of the last page parodies a parody, a You Tube skit of two Chinese art students spoofing the Backstreet Boys. But how many viewers laughed with, instead of at, the Asian performers? The same question resonates as the last echo of authorial anxiety regarding the comic effects of American Born Chinese . For no matter how funny its hypostatizations of anti-Asian senti- ments past and present, nor how profound its vehicle for accomplishing par- ody and parable in the animal, there is yet a danger in the animal metaphor. Epileptic's Death-Heads and the Significance of Master N Like American Born Chinese , David B.'s Epileptic demands that readers experience an ontological change. In thinking about the way Epileptic con- ditions an ideal reader, I am reminded of Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony (1977), a novel purported to recreate a ceremonial rite for the reader in its organization, plotting, and stylistic effects. Epileptic similarly positions the reader to undergo transformation through David B.'s hectic visual rendition of epilepsy. Variously pictured as dragons and serpents, epilepsy takes on a vibrant life of its own in the text, often in menacing pursuit of the adoles- cent protagonist, Pierre Francois (David B.'s given name), and his afflicted sibling, Jean-Christophe. Personified as a mythological beast, epilepsy sub- sumes both physical illness and psychic agon, reconfiguring reading as agony</page><page sequence="13">Michael A. Chaney 141 and inducing seizure through surreal details that haunt characters and read- er-viewers alike. The narrative positions readers as epileptics by forcing us to see chaoti- cally, frenetically, wildly Chapterless like Ceremony , the narrative design of Epileptic may leave readers feeling overwhelmed by panels teeming with inky, overwrought visual details of marauding samurai and prancing chimera. The urgency of reading is not for the cure, however, but for a stable paradigm (a sinthome) that will help us to make sense of and perhaps find pleasure in the disorienting surplus, hyperreal in its signifying yet garbled plenitude. As we strive to distinguish the miniature effects of weapon-brandishing warrior hordes, or the yin from the yang elements in various panels, so too must Pierre Francois (David B.) and his parents labor to distinguish hoaxes from healing, hypocrisy from hope. Along with the epileptic quality of its graphic style, the symbolic con- tent of the text's dreamwork - its war horses, serpentine dragons, anthropo- morphic birds of prey - represents so many death heads of danger and pro- tection. As with Maus , only part of the project of this autobiography is to picture the family's struggle in mythical, totemic iconography (which by the way gets personalized as David B.'s story, like so many other autobiographi- cal graphic novels that temper the tale of witnessed trauma with triumphant kiinstlerroman). Partner to this project is a visualization of becoming animal: of becoming human by becoming animal vis-ti-vis the experience of life and death, the fear of stagnancy and loss, and the hope of vitally expressive becoming - all from the vantage point of the human that cognizes its prox- imity to the animal. Deleuze and Guattari avail themselves of the animal metaphor to explain such becoming: "Becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal become. The becoming-animal of the human being is real, even if the ani- mal the human being becomes is not" (1987, 238). To elaborate my unabashedly Deleuzian appreciation for Epileptic , let us consider David B.'s graphic animalization of illness in a scene that self-reflex- ively unveils the text's constructedness. Disrupting a twisting series of family narratives, or mini-biographies, of his mother's grandmother, grandfather and great-grandmother, David B. integects a scene that pays homage to Art's dis- cussions with his father in Maus about the content of the very story that we are reading. Here, the scenes involve the author debating his mother, who protests against his portrayal of his great-great-grandmother as an alcoholic. In step with Matthew T.Jones's suggestion that self-reflexivity yields demys- tification - "the act of revealing the mechanisms of production responsible for creating the particular text" (2005, 276) - the scene makes clear the</page><page sequence="14">142 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1 ] struggle of author and text, man and monster, past and present to approxi- mate the subjective verities and flights of fancy that constitute existence. As the mother pleads with Pierre Francois while holding a draft in her hand (presumably of the panel we have just viewed) and insists that he depict the alcoholism as "some sort of monster" (B. 2005, 94); he replies, "But it's all true" (see Figure 6). As if to verify the full symbolic scope of his notion of truth, a monster stands behind the mother unseen by her in a subsequent panel (96). Thus, despite the fact that the verisimilitude of the story-as-con- struction is on one level questioned, its textuality demystified, the signature element of David B.'s textual style - what I call the shadow beast - is on another level manifestly present. The demystifying, non-diegetic narrative, in other words, is hereby engulfed with mystifying, diegetic elements: that which is demystified in a moment of metacritical revelation is present dur- ing the scene. As with the iconic effect of the dragon-like rendering of epilepsy, the shadow beast of alcoholism is by no means limited to repre- senting the affliction, but encompasses the rupture of discourse and episte- mology entailed by the affliction as well. Aside from referencing Maus , David B.s illustration strategy of the ani- mal here retroactively acts as a substitute for the allegedly shameful illustra- tion of a foremother whose debauchery has already been rendered. Like the mouse masks in Spiegelman's text, the shadow beast also demarcates that rup- ture of memory and representation which together attempt to bring closure to an implacable trauma. As an icon of trauma the animal in Epileptic yokes divergent domains of affective response to the past, haunting the present with an alterity of being- with-the-past in the face of objections to its proper telling in the present. Thus Epileptic's animals function as psychic indices-of-becoming in the Deleuzian sense, but the text as a whole is far too magisterial in scope and complexity for me to generalize it here. By way of working toward a con- clusion, however, I want to focus on one of the text's pictorial and animal anomalies. In its bewildering characterization of Master N (see Figure 7), Epileptic discloses the dark underside of an otherwise jubilant surrealism of animal figures seen only by the author-protagonist. Representing a middle ground between the racist overtones of the funny animal comic and the animal reader of the trauma narrative, Master N is the only animal character to interact with other "more realistically illustrated" characters - aside, that is, from his son Julian and his double, another Master N who briefly appears later, also in the form of a cat. Drawn as a hybrid tiger-human, Master N is atypical in this book, but characteristic of "the estranging effect of the hybrid animal characters, which constantly alerts one to the artificiality of visual representation, [and] offers a more radical destruc-</page><page sequence="15">Michael A. Chaney 143 tion of the illusion of realism than does the stylized minimalism of the comics in general" (Orban 2007, 63). Of course, the "estranging effect" in this case takes on an even deeper level of estrangement relative to the rest of the comic, since Master N is one of the only hybrid figures in the work to occupy a diegetic space of addressability - he speaks to and is heard by other characters, regardless of whether or not he is seen by them in the same ani- malized way that David B. has depicted him. What is special about Master N then is that he is the only animalized character shown interacting with oth- ers, as opposed to the beastly entourage of humanoid creatures that regular- ly attend Pierre Francois, which represent externalizations of his own warped interiority, but which interact only with him in spaces of shadowy depth and wooded mystery that visually announce themselves as more psychic than realistic. Master N, on the other hand, is shown in spaces coded as ordinary speaking with other members of the family seemingly unabashed by his out- ward felinity and wholly oblivious to its difference. Thus, if, as Andreas Huyssen in another context has argued, the materiality of the drawn animal figure disrupts "the very pictoriality of the animal comic" (2003, 134), and seeing as Epileptic resists giving itself completely over to the animal comic genre, then we must assume that some other level of pictoriality is disrupted by it. And given our prior lessons in animal pedagogy, it should come as no sur- prise that this other level yields residual ideological tensions in the text's questioning of race and illness (or moribundity) as twin afflictions of the body proper. Recalling Jean-Christophe and Pierre Francois's racist name-calling of the Algerian ("raghead") and emblematic of the book's sustained treatment of Asian-influenced lifestyles, the animalized appearance of Master N, an aikido master with dubious healing powers, is more than comical. The very uniqueness of his body in brute interaction with other human bodies oppos- es the phantasmatic - or shall we say, merely pictorial - display of similar hybrid bodies in the text, which never interact with other bodies marked as real. Indeed, these others inhabit a space of fantasy and fear, death and imag- ination, but this one explicitly, and oddly, does not. So what is it about the Japanese exoticism and intense physicality of Master N that earns him such anomalous status? His foil, KlimY, who runs the commune the family joins, is also Japanese. He also bears the single-letter surname; yet, he is not depict- ed as an animal. Is it therefore Master N's willing proximity to the infirm body - which everywhere in the text is shadowed by animal monstrosity - that transfers this honorific animal coding? In response, let us recall Deleuze's insistence on the strange reality of the condition of becoming-animal, in which "[t]he becoming-animal of the human being is real, even if the animal the human being becomes is not."</page><page sequence="16">144 College Literature 38.3 [Summer 201 1] Aptly, the animal in Epileptic never signifies beyond the symbolic. In its pan- els, the animal is always the emblem of something else, from the child-pro- tagonist's embrace of Anubis, dog-headed god of the dead, to his material- ized hallucination of his dead grandfather transformed into "goony-looking bird" (B. 2005, 75) with an elongated beak in the shape of the Grim Reaper's sickle, the animal becomes the grotesque icon of the terrible becoming of the human, its proliferating transpirations and expirations. Thus unreal ani- mals or monsters provide Pierre Francois a refuge from threats embodied in the real and in the normative. More importantly, however, they authorize varieties of his becoming relational: in relation to his brothers transformation through illness, to his family's struggle to accept that illness, and to his own intractable separation from both. In other words, these animals, ghosts, and monsters allow David B. to pose himself in conceptual equality to his broth- er. Only in the pages of this book can the two occupy commensurate posi- tions with respect to the unseen and its intrusions upon the real. Although the two feline Master Ns mark David B.'s becoming-animal project with inextricable entanglements of race, they nevertheless suggest a protection from threatening encroachments of the real in terms of physical alterity.The second Master N, who is drawn as an enlarged housecat, loses all of his astounding skills at aikido after a car accident and refuses to help Jean- Christophe; he is resolved instead to watch over the death of his ailing father (another wizened cat) . Ultimately, Epileptic suffers from a schizophrenic dis- order of iconographic display; it neither accepts nor abandons completely the mother's faith in the enchantments of mysticisms marked as exotic, arcane, animal - by turns distinguished at the level of the drawing, but sometimes lumped together into a pictorial cacophony of all things Buddhist or Oriental. But like David's ghostly retinue and all of the animals studied in this essay, the Masters N are rendered as animal not simply because they are other worldly, but because they signify the enabling conditions of art in, and as, life. We might observe, as a final point, that the narrative proper is less about the fail- ure of the family's quest to cure Jean-Christophe's epilepsy than it is about the triumph of Pierre Francois' maturation as an artist, his becoming, in other words, a master. And what better way to announce this successful promotion than to change his name to David B., in fitting tribute to his animal exemplar, Master N? As Katalin Orban contends, the hybrid animal-human body of the comics is "a body that does not settle what is and is not human but keeps asking this question - quietly but constantly" (2007, 68). And even as phys- iognomy haunts the human in such comics with monstrous excesses, it also produces the body as a horizon of infinite translatability, capacious in sym- bolization, halting in its unreadability. Indeed, like the oblivion of the ani-</page><page sequence="17">Michael A. Chaney 145 mal's face as recounted in theoretical speculations, the stylizations of the nor- mative human in the comics is never too far removed from the cartoon ani- mal's prevarications of it. And yet, it remains for us to ask, even as the comics relentlessly prod us to the question, what does the comic animal think and what, in thinking it, are we permitted to see in ourselves? Notes 1 Although Baker poses the question succinctly, his work poses a contrast to contemporary animal studies of critical theory by seeking to align the animal with the real that transcends discourse and epistemological construction and thus enacts a flight via the animal from postmodern and poststructuralist conceptions of reality. 2 For a thorough bibliography of comics studies scholarship on the funny ani- mal genre and the larger "world upside-down" tradition from which it derives, con- sult David Kunzle (2009). See also, Groensteen (1987). 3 For Deleuze and Guattari, any notion of becoming is available to a productive review whereby all "Becoming can and should be qualified as becoming-animal" (238). More than any specific reference to their notion of "becoming animal," which entails a radically non-linear, non-traditional conception of cognitive and psycho- logical organization, I am here referring to the way in which even realistic comics, still being primarily illustrated rather than simply written, bear evidence of that visu- ally obvious impress of the illustrator's subjective treatment of whatever the subject is, so that eruptions of a non-typical, unrealistic visual representation appear sporad- ically Whether deliberate or accidental, whether intended by the illustrator or mere- ly perceived by the reader, such eruptions tend to define themselves as divergences from a code already established in the text for representing human physiognomic typicality, in which divergence is almost always coded as a type of animality. 4 For more on the origins of the Monkey King myth, see Whalen Lai (1994, 39). 5 Comics theorist Thierry Groensteen stresses that this recursivity is made avail- able by the precondition of pictorial co-presence in comics, pinpointing "the rela- tional play of plurality of interdependent images as the unique ontological founda- tions of comics" (2007, 17). 6 Like Witek, Miles Orvell sees the animal metaphorically in Maus as "the read- er comes to forget that these are cats, mice, pigs and soon begins to view them instead as human types." Miles Orvell (1992, 119). 7 J. Stephen Pearson, "The Monkey King in the American Canon: Patricia Chao and Gerald Vizenor's use of an Iconic Chinese Character" (2006, 357). Other animal disciples in the story include Pigsy and the White Horse. 8 See Marc Singer (2002, 109). Eric Lott also includes cartoons among popular texts underwritten by blackface structures of feeling: "From 'Oh Susanna' to Elvis Presley, from circus clowns to Saturday morning cartoons, blackface acts and words have figured significantly in the white imaginary of the United States."
