<plain_text><page sequence="1">Descriptions of Darkness: Control and Self-Control in Tennyson's Princess KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON i Multeity, Order, and the Novel And as knowledge continues to grow by its alternating processes of distinction and combination, seeing smaller and smaller unlikenesses and grouping or associating these under a common likeness, it arrives at the conception of wholes composed of parts more and more multiplied and highly differenced, yet more and more absolutely bound together by various conditions of common likeness or mutual dependence. And the fullest example of such a whole is the highest example of Form: in other words, the relation of multiplex interdependent parts to a whole which is itself in the most varied and therefore the fullest relation to other wholes. - George Eliot, "Notes on Form in Art"1 SEVERAL IMPORTANT POEMS TENNYSON RESOLVES AN "EXTREME," problematic situation through a recourse to "variety." "The Two Voices" is paradigmatic: And all so variously wrought, I marvelled how the mind was brought To anchor by one gloomy thought. ( 11. 457'459)2 Idylls of the King dissolves the unifying vision of Arthur with his own famous summary: "The old order changeth, yielding place to new, / And God fulfils himself in many ways, / Lest one good custom should corrupt the world" (PA, 11. 408-410). In Memoriam very clearly moves from the "confusion" ("Forgive these wild and wandering cries, / Con- fusions of a wasted youth" [Prologue, 11. 41-42]) of self-absorbed grief to a consolation that depends on "diffusion" ("some diffusive power," 130.7): "Behold, I dream a dream of good, / And mingle all the world with thee" (129.11*12). The Princess, too, could be seen as resolving the adamantine, extremist will of Princess Ida by recourse to variety in general, and gender differences in specific. She needs to come down out of her feminist monovision back to this piebald world. This, indeed, is the reading of Robert Pattison, who resourcefully studies the "variety" that is centrally associated with the idyllic mode in Theocritus and 233</page><page sequence="2">234/ VICTORIAN POETRY throughout Tennyson. According to Pattison, the formal self-descrip- tion - "a medley" - emphasizes the "natural" virtue of "flexibility" that Princess Ida fails to possess. He interprets the repeated use of statuary throughout the poem as follows: "The statues are used for comic effect in the plot . . . and stand as a metaphor for the bad meta- morphosis brought about by the Princess's fixed attitudes and rigid ad- herence to a principle not fully in accord with the plastic impulses of nature."3 This plastic virtue, however, presents certain problems. For in- stance, "variety" in Tennyson can often seem too much like "confu- sion" or "chaos." Coleridge thought of poetry in terms of a "multeity in unity"; that is, the world is described in terms of variety, multifari- ousness, and multiplicity, but aesthetic praises have to do with bounding this variety within an "order" or "harmony."4 Tennyson's poetry frequently operates through projections and blendings, but it is also as often desperate to hold on to a bounded, controlled sense of self. Thus Arthur Hallam writes in his important 1830 essay, "We have remarked five distinctive excellencies of his own manner. First, his luxuriance of imagination, and at the same time his control over it."5 Hallam wants to show that the "sensation" poet, who might be sensualist or dissipated, is still in charge of the boundaries of his body. And Tennyson asked that "Crossing the Bar" be placed at the end of all editions of his various work; he drifts willingly toward a "boundless deep," but his final image is of a boundary, "when I have crost the bar." A tension, then, exists between an exterior "variety" (difference, heterogeneity), which may itself shift from ordered system ("The Pal- ace of Art") to anarchic chaos ("Lucretius"), and the structure of "self confronting this "various world." Plastic virtues and rigid statu- ary are, as a consequence, not so easy to interpret. It helps to observe that, as a title, The Princess, A Medley is analogous to Idylls of the King. In each case a formal variety or plurality ("medley," "idylls") confronts a more extreme, idealistic, monolithic perspective (Prin- cess, King). Though King Arthur dies and the Princess sheds her pre- vious self, neither perspective should be seen as entirely erased by the final changes. On the contrary, the will-to-unity fights an ongoing war with the will-to-variety. The structure of The Princess closely resembles that of Shakespeare's comedies (such as Love's Labors Lost), but its problems and darknesses move it towards Shakespeare's romances.6 The frame of The Princess openly alludes to The Winter's Tale, that famous "com- edy" with a statue scene. There Hermione is fixed by the wintery jeal-</page><page sequence="3">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON h35 ousy of Leontes as the ultimate objectification of his will. Who has the power of definition and of creation? In The Winter's Tale power shifts between King Leontes and Midwife Paulina, while the child Mamillius is allowed to speak the titular "winter's tale" to Hermione. The Princess , too, has much to do with the relationship of storytelling, power, and sexuality. Edward Dowden's description of Shakespearean romance is prob- ably influenced by Tennyson. Dowden is credited with virtually in- venting "romance" as a Shakespearean genre in 1876. Against the compellingly lunatic Shakespeare described by Taine, Dowden nar- rates a biography that moves step-by-step toward the "serenity" of the last plays, and specifically, "self-control."7 In general, the term is a characteristically masculine, British virtue. In specific, the term is probably drawn from Dowden's earlier work on Tennyson, where In Memoriam is celebrated also for its gradual movement toward "self- control" (sec. 13 1 ).8 There are, in fact, many unnoticed relations between The Princess and Tennyson poems that have received much more critical atten- tion, In Memoriam and Idylls of the King. But it will be a main tenet of our method here that The Princess (1847) might also be instructively read as one of Kathleen Tillotson's Novels of the Eighteen- For ties ("One reason why the novel is particularly interesting in the eigh- teen-forties is that it was in process of becoming the dominant form").9 The Princess not only looks backward toward Shakespearean romance, it also looks forward to those other "novels-in-verse," Eliza- beth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh and Robert Browning's The Ring and the Book. Some of the most interesting recent work on British nineteenth-century fiction seems to us to have powerful implications for The Princess , particularly feminist work on authority, romance, and sexuality and also Foucauldian studies of discipline, taxonomy, and institution in the novel. The Princess begins, for instance, by fraudulently announcing a taste for "variety" and "mingling." The first line is "Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day," which, by setting down both male and female- sounding names, looks forward to a Prince who has both the feminiz- ing "catalepsy" (1.20) and "lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl" (1.3). The initial images of the "Prologue" are chaotic bric-a-brac: Huge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time; And on the tables every clime and age Jumbled together; (P, 11. 15-1 7)10 In contrast to the Prince's father, a tyrannical senex iratus who wants to "crush her pretty maiden fancies dead / In iron gauntlets" (1.87-</page><page sequence="4">236/ VICTORIAN POETRY 88), the Prince appears to be remarkable for moderation and temper- ateness. His journey to Ida's academy is a diplomatic mission, a declaration of love, not war. Because of his vulnerabilty during sei- zures, he needs to bring some friends along with him. And this trio of men - the Prince, Cyril, and Florian - proceed to demonstrate their immense "flexibility" by entering the college dressed as women. But the "jumbled- together" blending of male and female in mod- erate, "plastic" fashion is the truest disguise for the desire to create and control. The qualities of "playfulness," "moderation," "medley," hermaphroditism, and even catalepsy are all the more insidious for not appearing tyrannical and fascistic. Our reading may appear overly "serious" as an exegesis of an "occasion not for ideological but stylis- tic mediation, a sounding board for tonal effects," where "the difficul- ties . . . center on the adjustment of genres and calibration of tones."11 But this is just what "mere" Medley wants us to think; this is the moderate voice of seduction that sings Ida back to her "true" self. It is to read "medley" as the virtuous point of view, without noticing that its "variety" swamps, monolithically, other readings. At which point "variety" is a front for a perspective that is actually limited, in- trusive, and controlling. Our argument is that these fine "adjust- ments" of genre and tone cover for a "strange diagonal" of plot that is not "strange" in the least. The "strangers" that arrive at Ida's Acad- emy are, in reality, absolutely familiar. They bring their homeworld with them - their laws, their definitions, their stories - and Ida's world vanishes into an apologetic air. We concur, then, with Rod Edmond's comment on Princess criticism: Reading the learned journals in the course of preparing this chapter, I have been struck by how congenial Tennyson's via media between feminism and male chauvinism has proved for most liberal criticism. Such criticism moves in effortlessly to occupy the middle ground established by the poem's resolution of opposites. The complicity with the poem's repudiation of "extremes" leaves criticism with little to do apart from making clearer what the poem is saying and admiring the way it says it. One of the few critics not to fall into this trap, as Edmond observes, is Terry Eagleton (who has undoubtedly never been fooled by any poem); "Eagleton attacks Tennyson's endorsement of the dominant values of his age, seeing his mild reformism as a subtle but necessary strategy for consolidating and extending the ideological hegemony of the Victorian ruling classes."12 We hope to further the critical consideration of The Princess by reading the poem in between a "strategy" which Tennyson controls and a "discourse" in which Tennyson's text circulates the ideological principles and contradictions of his day. To do this, it seems helpful</page><page sequence="5">{CATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON /237 to read The Princess as a novel. As a preliminary step, therefore, we recall D. A. Miller's The Novel and the Police (Berkeley: Univ. of Cali- fornia Press, 1988). Miller's book disputes the idea that the novel is literature's most "open form," that the novel approaches anything like Bakhtin's "heteroglossia" or plurality of conflicting voices. On the contrary, the novel is secretly legalistic, authoritative, disciplinary, full of closings rather than openings, in short, a happy habitat for the police. This accords well with our contention that "the medley" is no more an "open form" than a novel, and it takes the stakes beyond Tennyson's personal "bad faith." But we will also offer a reading of The Princess which suggests that there are feminine spaces that the intruding men cannot see, often imaged as areas of darkness. These blanknesses may only reinforce the symbolic system of the patriarchy; that is, like Freud's "dark conti- nent," these spaces would only substantiate an enlightened male dis- course which willingly allows a mysterious or mystified feminine space to fall outside of its control, all the better to foreground its own glit- tering walls. But this rather bleak Foucauldian sense of the inescapability of discourse might also be balanced with a more vitalist feeling that these dark spaces constitute an irony and counter- image that verges on liberation. 2 The Trio: Language and Form She was too young when her mother died to have received any cautions or words of advice respecting the subject of a woman's life - if, indeed, wise parents ever directly speak of what, in its depth and power, cannot be put into words - which is a brooding spirit with no definite form or shape that men should know it, but which is there, and present before we have recognised and realised its existence. - Elizabeth Gaskell, Ruth, Chapter 3 The narrative framework for The Princess has been compared to that of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and, indeed, rules are set down for the passing of story from one speaker to the next. But in Tennyson the men tell all the stories, and the women sing only the interpolated lyrics: and the women sang Between the rougher voices of the men, Like linnets in the pauses of the wind: And here I give the story and the songs. (P, 11. 236-239) Chaucer's Wife of Bath would obviously find these story-telling laws quite absurd. But Tennyson is willing to produce the "medley," whose climactic virtue is apparently flexibility, entirely from masculine points of view.</page><page sequence="6">238/ VICTORIAN POETRY The principal contrast that begins the poem, then, which is legis- lated by the framework, and which is carried through the entirety of the poem, is the contrast of masculine narration to feminine or femi- nized object. In general, what this masculine narration attempts to do is reduce the feminine to form, while at the same time chastising the feminine desire for forms of her own. The title itself opposes the sin- gular feminine object of the story ("The Princess") to the flexible genre of its own definition. The narrative tries to control the women by defining them, and tries to give the appearance of its own flexibil- ity by announcing its own seeming lack of control. This poem is "only a medley"; the Prince has spasmodic fits. But this "variety" and lack of self-control is in appearance only.13 A preliminary example of this controlling description comes in the frame narrative: At this upon the sward She tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot: That's your light way; but I would make it death For any male thing but to peep at us.' (P, 11. 148' 151) This passage, spoken by Lilia, is the "origin" for the death penalty that appears at the border of Princess Ida's academy. In mock-heroic mode, the threat contained in the words contrasts violently with the description of the diminutive speaker. But the ideological point seems to be to reduce Lilia's potential for danger by literally describing her as "tiny." The force of the description then becomes not wholly dif- ferent from the deformations of the feet of Chinese women - as mentioned by Lady Psyche - "little-footed China" (2.1 18). Lilia is the truest origin of the story to follow, but the origin is re- narrated by men. Thus Lilia is further described: Petulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed; A rosebud set with little wilful thorns, And sweet as English air could make her, she.(P, 11. 152-154) Lilia, who is already named a white flower, has "little" thorns, and practically vanishes into air- those "pauses" of songs that the women are allowed to sing. If Lilia's reforming language initially exceeds its social boundaries, the effect is temporary, due to the reinforced physi- cal image. And in a strong sense, the whole poem is similarly a re-narration of feminine desire and language that exceeds its social boundaries. Lilia may be the frame's origin for both story and Princess ("Take Lilia, then, for heroine" [P, 11. 217-218]), but the description of Ida is more complicated than the mock-heroic treatment of Lilia. The first description of Ida is found in Part 2:</page><page sequence="7">KATHERINE FRANK and STEVE DILLON /239 There at a board by tome and paper sat, With two tame leopards couched beside her throne, All beauty compassed in a female form, The Princess; liker to the inhabitant Of some clear planet close upon the Sun, Than our man's earth; such eyes were in her head, And so much grace and power, breathing down From over her arched brows, with every turn Lived through her to the tips of her long hands, And to her feet. (2. 18-27) Initially the description works as a defensive framing and circum- scription. There is the appearance of structured order ("two tame leopards")* even though the scene is potentially extremely disruptive. In particular, there is a thematic juxtaposition between the leopards and the books. Just as it is threatening for Lilia to be in charge of a (deadly) reformist story, the Princess is framed by both writing and beasts. Fortunately, though, the animals are "tame," and we suggest that the ordered description - "compassing" her into "form" - also ef- fectively tames the Princess. As the description continues, however, her essential energy seems to disrupt the boundaries that have just been presented to us and con- flict with the descriptive desire to contain that energy.14 She is con- ventionally "celestial" and therefore awesome to men, like all those other Victorian princesses and queens, Eliot's Gwendolyn Harleth, Hardy's Eustacia Vye, Haggard's She. But the description at least makes her planet "clear," which seems less to designate serenity (Lat. serenuSy clear) than transparency; she can (the description hopes) both be described and seen into. The description concludes by at- tempting to catch her vitality at the edges of a fragmented body, "arched brows," "tips of long hands," "to her feet." The technique of narration here is similar to the initial description of Lilia (who "tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot"). Ida's energy even "breathes" down, like the "sweet" air about Lilia and the non-threatening "pauses of the wind" that are the songs. But, just as clearly, her energy is now much less easily contained by form. And when she finally speaks, her form becomes even less defin- able. Her words drift out, uncontainable. It is the fiction of narration in The Princess that the women are described and re-narrated, but are also allowed their own voices. Their "forms" belong to the percep- tions of men, but their words are, for the moment, their own. As Ida speaks, the fluidity and all-encompassing nature of her words sub- merge the fragmented, defensive description formerly proposed: "We give you welcome: not without redound Of use and glory to yourselves ye come, The first-fruits of the stranger." (2.28-30)</page><page sequence="8">240/ VICTORIAN POETRY Any focus that was once directed toward her individual form is now dissolved in the royal plural. By speaking in the "we," Ida enables herself to become lost amid surrounding forms, while displacing the focus onto the "strangers," the three men. A main tension of The Princess , once again, is the conflict between women's power to use language, which enables them to create their own identity and situa- tion, and men's power to describe the women into silence. As much as both critical readers and the narration itself try to re- duce the Academy to "the Princess," the foundational energy of the Institute belongs to more than just Ida. Ida is authority over a closely related trio of originary women who are imaged as a body politic: She says the Princess should have been the Head, Herself [Blanche] and Lady Psyche the two arms; And so it was agreed when first they came. (3-i8'2o) Since Tennyson arranges various relationships and triangles in Idylls of the King in order to work out the "sense at war with soul" (Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur; Elaine-Lancelot-Guinevere; Isolde- Tristram-Isolde, and others), and also spends a good deal of time treating the problematic origins of the "table round" in The Coming of Arthur, it seems important to examine the relationships and descrip- tions of this trio and their attempt to create - if not a Camelot - at least a heroic space of learning.15 We begin with their names. Names, if taken literally, which is to say, reductively, can control their object even more fiercely (because more permanently) than description. As we observed above, it will al- ways be difficult for Lilia to become dangerous. Paul de Man puts it this way: Anthropomorphism freezes the infinite chain of tropological transformations and propositions into one single assertion or essence which, as such, excludes all others. It is no longer a proposition but a proper name, as when the metamorphosis in Ovid's stories culminates and halts in the singleness of a proper name, Narcissus or Daphne or whatever.16 The proper name freezes the chain of figuration in de Man's decon- structionist formulation. From a more intentional and sociological perspective, where the "chain" of figuration may also have to do with societal chains, it can be argued that the proper name in certain modes of representation would be the extreme form of description that attempts precisely to bind a character's ambiguity and energy throughout the story, and before the story even begins.17 This seems to be the case in The Princess, whose very slightly ambiguous conclusion seems in many ways to be palpably foregone. In earlier poems, Tennyson frequently selects stanza- and rhyme- forms that virtually announce the poem's conclusion; thus the</page><page sequence="9">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON /241 tetrameter triplets of "The Two Voices" essentially assures us that this poem will end on a positive note, while the complicated rhyme- pattern of the "Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind" forecasts a poem that will break into despair at the end. Just so, the names of his founding heroines help to define their Academy as short-lived. The names of Psyche and Ida are associated with the erotic. Psyche's name associates her instantly with Cupid. Ida is more obscure, but readers of The Princess might well have been familiar with "Oenone" where "Ida" is murmured over and over again, starting with the first line: "There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier / Than all the valleys of Ionian hills." This Ida is almost certainly kin to Tennyson's Princess. As Christopher Ricks points out in his notes, Ida is not only the mountain on the south of the Troas, she is also "mother of wild beasts." At the beginning Ida is seen at table next to those leopards, and at the end she is coaxed down from her metaphorical mountain by the famous song, "Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height." The eroticized names of Ida and Psyche contain the fate of the women's academy within them, for the plot of The Princess is the collapse of education by seduction.18 It would clearly be a different story if the Princess were named instead, like Athena in Homer's Odyssey, Mentor. Blanche is odd woman out. It would be pleasant to think that Ida's arms might frame themselves gracefully as canonical Romantic poems. Ida's dignified head would then look out over, on the one hand, Keats's Ode to Psyche, and on the other, Shelley's Mont Blanc, But instead there is an obvious asymmetry between the classically Hellenic names of Ida and Psyche and the unlovely British name, Blanche. The trio's triangular or corporeal form is unbalanced by the names themselves, with the consequence that, from the outset, the Academy is teetering, as doomed to fall as Arthur's Camelot. The transgression of the Institute's boundaries occurs, therefore, as soon as the story is narrated. The plot details then merely confirm the breaching action already performed in the "creative" act of nam- ing. The women might have been an ideally organized body politic, but actually form a misshapen, unstable unit: "[Blanche] says the Princess should have been the Head, . . . But Lady Psyche was the right hand now, / And she the left, or not, or seldom used; / Hers more than half the students, all the love" (3.18-23). The power to create and to form is taken away from women when men tell the women's story about the desire to create and form. The plot's "intru- sion" performs and confirms the acts of naming and narration. But we</page><page sequence="10">242/ VICTORIAN POETRY also argue that the attempt to control by description and narration is not and cannot be a complete success. For all the enlightenment that these men bring to the Academy, there are still seas of darkness cast about them, shadows that they cannot describe. The structure of The Princess shares many features of novel form, particularly as elucidated by recent theoretical critics of fiction. In Desire and Domestic Fiction: A Political History of the Novel, Nancy Armstrong begins by outlining "the rise of female authority in the novel," which moves from "the logic of the social contract" to "the logic of the sexual contract."19 She details the fantasies of "self' control" that drive Victorian novels such as Jane Eyre, but that ultimately serve to replicate rather than undermine societal norms. Her book concludes with an extended treatment of seduction - a "sexual contract"; Armstrong writes that "to relinquish the power of self-definition is the whole objective of seduction, as Pamela demon- strates. But if the woman relinquishes the power to discover a self that she believes society considers to be her true self, then the dis- tinction between seduction and education is rhetorical."20 The movement from "social/sexual contract" to "education/ seduction" also characterizes the narrative of The Princess. Ida's college is founded by breaking her betrothal "compact" to the Prince (1.46). The institution itself is immediately associated with legisla- tion; the death-threat causes the innkeeper to turn pale with fear ("Averring it was clear against all rules / For any man to go" [1.176- 177]), and nearly the first act upon entering the college is the reading of "statutes," which consist largely of isolationist prohibitions ("Not for three years to correspond with home," etc. [2-56ff.]). The authori- tative perspective of the frame narrative is still, however, in control of the operative laws. The frame strikes both the generic contract with the reader and also the locutionary contract between men and women. The story is allowed to define itself; the men are allowed to tell the story. The men in the story immediately ignore the terrible boundary law already set forth by both Lilia and Gama: then we past an arch, Whereon a woman-statue rose with wings From four winged horses dark against the stars; And some inscription ran along the front, But deep in shadow. (1.206-210) The men are willing to see the frozen form of a feminine "statue," but not the life-threatening words of the "statute." The darkness is mas- culine self-willed blindness, and the effect is to steal primal words from the feminine institute. As we will see, these darknesses will con- tinue to accumulate around the edges of masculine vision.</page><page sequence="11">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON / 243 When Psyche discovers the intruders - who may be voyeurs, spies, or the police themselves, depending on your critical bent - she responds immediately by sentencing them to death. But the men collectively defend themselves by seductively redefining her. "Are you that Lady Psyche," they ask over and over again (2.219, 238, 242, 250, 259), until it becomes the statement that she is the Psyche that she was ("You are that Psyche"). They soften her rigidity and harden her feminine tenderness. The scene serves also as a foreshadowing of the Prince's final seduction of Ida, and her return to her "true self." The sexual contract of The Princess is never really broken, then, since female authority and individuality are constantly under male super- vision. As Nina Auerbach (in The Woman and the Demon) and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar (in The Madwoman in the Attic) have shown, Victorian literature is obsessed with sexually dangerous women who need to be restrained and controlled. In this context, Nancy Armstrong suggests that nineteenth-century literature frequently at' tempts to displace political problems by recasting them as sexual problems, where they can in turn be "resolved" by sexual contracts such as seduction (p. 165). Women's desire for education was seen as threatening by many of Tennyson's contemporaries.21 The Princess re- casts the problem of authority and control in terms of the sexual. The Prince, for example, ignores the death-threat because he is, in effect, "so much in love." In general the poem's narrative casts the erotic as more central than the educational or the political, as in many Victo- rian novels. Robert Polhemus cites Trollope in 1870: "It is from nov- els that girls learn what is expected from them, and what they are to expect when lovers come"; and he describes the school in Bronte's Villette: "The place of feminine education, discipline and surveillance throbs with erotic desire and intrigue."22 Polhemus reads Satis House in Dickens' Great Expectations as "the palace of Cupid," a "bizarre labyrinth of erotic fixation," where Pip waits like Psyche outside the Palace, "heartsick with desire" (pp. 142-143). Tennyson's Psyche also has many telling affinities with the myth in Apuleius. The first time we see Psyche, we also see her child, "Aglaia" or "Brightness" (2.96); the offspring of Cupid and Psyche is named "Joy-" Psyche's husband is virtually invisible (it is explained that he died suddenly), just as Cupid visits Psyche in the darkness. In Apuleius, Psyche's intense and expressly prohibited desire to see Cu- pid leads to a narrative of tormented penitence, where she is led all over the world, and accused by Venus of seducing Cupid. Cupid mor- alizes her collapsed state at the end of the narrative: "Again you have</page><page sequence="12">244/ VICTORIAN POETRY ruined yourself, unhappy one, by your uncontrollable curiosity."23 By divine intervention of Venus and Jove, however, all things are set aright, and "at last Psyche was properly married to Cupid, and in due time she bore him a daughter, whom we call Joy." In Tennyson, the Prince brings love and "uncontrollable curios- ity," but it is once again Psyche who lapses into transgression and penitence. As Laurie Langbauer shows, the figure of the Mother is fre- quently deployed as a romance reconciliation that serves to limit women's individuality and so return the feminine to the proper sym- bolic order.24 Tennyson's Psyche capitulates to her proper role as mother in a desperately guilty image of maternity: Red grief and mother's hunger in her eye, And down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half The sacred mother's bosom, panting, burst The laces toward her babe; (6.130-133) Psyche as she sprang To meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks; Then felt it sound and whole from head to foot, And hugged and never hugged it close enough, And in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it. (6.192-196) Psyche transforms her self by literally bursting her seams, and then nearly consumes her child. The child nurses from her, and she nurses from the child, as she returns linguistically to childlike babbling ("mumbled it"). Cupid visited Psyche in the dark in Apuleius, but Tennyson highlights the well-lit woman under control by re-naming Psyche's child "Brightness." The proper name here means that every- thing is, in fact, proper, because now visible. Langbauer observes that "Diana's loss of self [in Meredith's Diana of the Crossways] is figured in terms of rebirth," and in The Princess maternal metaphors also allow the reconciling transformations. The origin for the Prince's concluding speech is his mother, to whom Ida disparagingly compares herself: "But I" Said Ida, tremulously, "so all unlike - It seems you love to cheat yourself with words: This mother is your model." (7.3 12-3 15) But Ida has, in fact, rather successfully replaced the Prince's mother; when the College turns into a "Hospital" the women assume their maternal roles as "nurses."25 The narrative thus allows the Prince to return to his origin, of which his nurse later told him:</page><page sequence="13">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON 1 245 I babbled for you, as babies for the moon, Vague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me From all high places, lived in all fair lights, Came in long breezes rapt from inmost south And blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn With Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods; The leader wildswan in among the stars Would clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light The mellow breaker murmured Ida. (4.408-416) The connection between this light-strewn passage and Psyche's child, "Brightness," should be apparent. Each child "babbles" ("babbling laughter" [6.1 21]), and nature murmurs "Ida" as Psyche murmurs to her child. Langbauer writes that "Meredith assumed the mother's tra- ditional identity as the exemplary nonself that nurtures and re-enforces the infant self, especially the son's" (p. 57). Just so, the Prince is usefully returned to a childhood serenity by Nurse Ida. But there is a crucial difference between the state of childhood visited by Psyche and the Prince. Psyche is truly infantilized, driven to a murmuring state "without speech" (Lat. infans), as Ida is driven to complete silence, and as Lilia is continually referred to as "little Lilia." The Prince, on the other hand, is oddly "representational" for a child.26 He cannot remember this early age without his nurse's help; yet even then he murmured not babbling nonsense but the contracted object of his father's intent. The Prince "instinctively" associates Ida's name with nature, with "mother nature," in effect. Meredith, concludes Langbauer, emphasizes "cheerfully choosing the mother's law in order to surmount it"; "the mother is specifically the means to such power [the power over life and death] because her traditional role associates her with the creation and extinction of the self (p. 61). The "mother" is a useful figure to image reconciliation in The Princess, which is a poem about delimiting the feminine desire to cre- ate, although this "mother" does not then in any way empower the feminine. "Ida, Ida," he murmurs; but it is her that he "cheats with words," not himself. Lady Blanche is a cacophonous blank, an odd name among the lyrical women's names, among the women's lyrics, and among Tennyson's characters in general. As Christopher Ricks observes, Blanche as "petty villain" is relatively unusual in Tennyson as an ex- planation for evil; in Idylls of the King Vivien and Modred are "bad" characters, but it is clear that the exemplary sin of Lancelot and Guinevere followed by scandalous gossip causes the "widening rift" in Camelot.27 In our argument, however, Blanche is an unnecessarily in- ternal explanation for the collapse of the institution; her name and character attempt to distract the reader from the true explanation for</page><page sequence="14">246/ VICTORIAN POETRY the Academy's fall. Tennyson does not want to say explicitly (and simply) that the Academy has transgressed patriarchal bounds, so he has his male characters transgress the feminine boundaries in order to "discover" that the college has already fallen. In a poem whose songs are canonical, and where lines like the "murmuring of innumerable bees" are notorious for their sonorous sound, poor Blanche is predetermined to be insufficiently lovely. Which also means that she may prove uncontrollable, or worse yet, unseducible. The first mention of Blanche at the college is as a choice between her and Psyche: "Which was prettiest, / Best natured?" the men ask (i. 230-231). "Lady Psyche" is the answer, and the men re- spond, with "one voice," "hers are we." At first glance, Blanche seems to be responsible for the division among the founding members, but in the end her power to corrupt is clearly limited. The school is explicitly set out to teach daughters from a woman's point of view, but Melissa has easily survived both feminine education and her mother's corruption: we saw The Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood, Melissa, with her hand upon the lock, A rosy blonde, and in a college gown, That clad her like an April daffodilly (Her mother's colour) with her lips apart, And all her thoughts as fair within her eyes, As bottom agates seem to wave and float In crystal currents of clear morning seas. (2.299*307) Mellifluous Melissa wears her mother's color, and is then turned to a purely seductive exterior ("her lips apart" though not speaking) by the masculine description. Her thinking is drawn toward the tradi- tional love-blazon of her "fair" eyes, and once again she is associated with a non-threatening "clarity." Melissa has survived her mother's deathly intractability ("As chanted on the blanching bones of men" [2.182]); we know this be- cause she blushes. She is seen first wearing her "mother's colour," but in actuality the color she wears is red, not yellow. At the end, Melissa walks among the wounded men "with blush and smile, a medicine in themselves" (7.47). The main crisis between Melissa and her mother occurs when Blanche discovers that her daughter knows that the re- cently arrived students are actually men: "Girls? - more like men!" [says Blanche] and at these words the snake, My secret, seemed to stir within my breast; And oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek Began to burn and burn, and her lynx eye To fix and make me hotter, till she laughed: "O marvellously modest maiden, you!</page><page sequence="15">^CATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON /247 Men! girls, like men! why, if they had been men You need not set your thoughts in rubric thus For wholesale comment." (3.27-35) As Ruth Bernard Yeazell explains, "modest blushing" is an impor- tant social signal, largely intended for the masculine gaze. In the pa- triarchal symbolic order, blushing is an important way to signal pu- rity, shame, or ardent desire.28 Blanche is unblushing and shameless, an inscrutable, obstinate blank, whereas Melissa is as transparent to the men as she is to Blanche. Blanche makes a mocking joke about "mixed company, " which would be a good place for innocence to blush; but it is striking that Melissa's "modest blush," which signals that she is still part of conventional society, seeks precisely to guard the intruding men from her own mother. Yeazell observes that the blush is frequently found immensely attractive, and indeed Cyril is at once overwhelmed ("Pale one, blush again"). Melissa, after all, like Psyche, is for them. In the logic of the narrative, Blanche is doomed to guilty exile, since she is impossible to seduce. Earlier Psyche herself offers a prom- ise that dissipates even as she enunciates it: Hear my conditions: promise (otherwise You perish) as you came, to slip away Today, tomorrow, soon: (2.275-277) And the men promise ("we promised each" [2.280]). By contrast, Cyril finds Blanche to be astonishingly "solid opposition, crabbed and gnarled" (3.1 10). But after immense effort he offers a final deal: "Here I promise you Some palace in our land, where you shall reign The head and heart of all our fair she-world, And your great name flow on with broadening time Forever." (3. 145-149) This she "balances a little" (1. 149), but defers an answer, which we never hear. The men's promises to both Psyche and Blanche are re- lated, moreover, to the Prince's marital promises to Ida ("O we will walk this world, / Yoked in all exercise of noble end" [7.339-340]), where the silent response of the Princess is understood to mean that she accepts. We showed earlier how Ida's transformation at the end is related to Psyche's in terms of maternity; Blanche's narrative is also tellingly related to that of the Princess. In her exit speech, Blanche effectively erases her contributions to the Academy: "I that have wasted here health, wealth, and time, / And talent, I - you know it - I will not boast" U-333-334)- Her morbid speech echoes in advance the change that comes over Ida at the end; there the Princess looks out "as one that . . . sees a great black cloud . . . expunge the world":</page><page sequence="16">248/ VICTORIAN POETRY so fared she gazing there; So blackened all her world in secret, blank And waste it seemed and vain; till down she came, And found fair peace once more among the sick. (7. 26*29) Intractable Blanche divides and wastes the college, and looks back on her life as a waste of time. As Psyche bursts the seams of self to return to a proper motherhood, and as Melissa signals with her blush that she is "modest," not a threat, so too Ida looks at her life as empty, "vain," "blank," and thus appears before the Prince, Glowing all over noble shame; and all Her falser self slipt from her like a robe, And left her woman, lovelier in her mood Than in her mould that other. (7.145-148) Blanche is described in extreme terms of absolute obduracy and de- graded bestiality (her final simile compares her to a vulture) because she refuses to be seduced by the invaders. Her character is associated with a wasteland, a blankness, a void; Blanche is once again the dark emptiness that cannot be contained by men's promises and looks. 3 Catalepsy and War "These women are incomprehensible. They have the strangest knack of startling you with unpleasant surprises. To-day you see them bouncing, buxom, red as cherries, and round as apples; to-morrow they exhibit themselves effete as dead weeds, blanched and broken down. And the reason of it all? that's the puzzle." - Charlotte Bronte, Shirley (Chap. 11) As in Maud, The Princess concludes with a crucial relationship of spasmodicism, militarism, and self-control. Tennyson added the Prince's "weird seizures" in 1851, just four years before the publica- tion of Maud (1855). In Maud the speaker spends time in a madhouse before finally calming himself amid a patriotic community of soldiers who will fight in the Crimean War. The Prince's seizures have been much maligned, but they serve an important function in advancing the poem's sexual and political meanings. Clearly the catalepsy, like the genre of "medley" itself, serves to effeminize the Prince, in order to balance the "Amazonian," masculine nature of Ida. The illness gives his character a vulnerability to match Ida's own list of isolation- ist errors. These revisions, therefore, serve again in part to distract us from the notion that the Prince is "in control"; how could he be, when he cannot even control himself? But the parallel between Ida's militarism and the Prince's catalepsy once more points up significant differences. In brief, Ida can never successfully cross over the border into a truly warlike mode, whereas the Prince's fits are as much moments of vision as they are</page><page sequence="17">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON / 249 moments of vulnerability. Ida's warlike temper begins as the plot crosses the exit of Blanche with the arrival of certain letters. These she receives as follows: dispatches which the Head Took half-amazed, and in her lion's mood Tore open, silent we with blind surmise Regarding, while she read, till over brow And cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom As of some fire against a stormy cloud, When the wild peasant rights himself, the rick Flames. (4.360*367) Ida blushes not with the conventional "rubric" of Melissa, but with the "blood-red blossom of war" (Maud). The men rightly characterize their gaze as "blind," because there is for the moment no description with which to understand her behavior. But then a long-tailed simile rises up to describe her, even as she is found absolutely unable to speak. Indeed, her lion-like mood causes her to lose the power of speech for one hundred lines (4.361-477). She looks out over a world without language ("a new-world Babel, woman built" [4.466]), at which point this simile allows her finally to speak: Not peace she looked, the Head: but rising up Robed in the long night of her deep hair, so To the open window moved, remaining there Fixed like a beacon-tower above the waves Of tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye Glares ruin, and the wild birds on the light Dash themselves dead. (4.469-475) If "not peace," then what? She ought to be "war," but that is the pre- cinct of men. Instead she is, in this figure, practically the opposite of a "beacon-tower"; she comes to the window "robed in the long night," and the light she does offer is ruinous. War's "home is in the sinews of a man" (5.257), and a lion-mooded women is clearly a dark stranger to herself, lost. Despite the seemingly "unsexed" or masculine nature of the women's college, then, the women and Ida in particular are not al- lowed to cross into the masculine territory of force. The men are, however, easily allowed to cross over the boundaries of the college, even going so far as to dress and speak like women. The Prince, fur- thermore, crosses over into the fit of his effeminate illness without losing control of himself or the situation. Christopher Ricks notes that the Prince's seizures are as much "mystical vision" as they are de- bilitating collapses (p. 183). Indeed, a contemporary attitude toward epilepsy and madness would combine morality with pathology; that is, medical writers at the time held that madness could occur at the same time as rational lucidity. This relatively new perspective combined with new approaches to treatment; the emphasis after the 1820s is</page><page sequence="18">250/ VICTORIAN POETRY on self-restraint rather than institutional restraint, and doctors attempt to teach self-control as both a cure and also a preventative to madness.29 The Prince's seizures take him precisely to the dark, feminine realm: "I seemed to move among a world of ghosts, / And feel myself the shadow of a dream" (1. 17-18). Thus the "long night of her dark hair" reveals Ida's misguided monomania, and so do the Prince's dreams. For instance, On a sudden my strange seizure came Upon me, the weird vision of our house: The Princess Ida seemed a hollow show, Her gay-furred cats a painted fantasy, Her college and her maidens, empty masks, And I myself the shadow of a dream, For all things were and were not. (3.167-173) But his infliction is erroneously described; he is "not the shadow of a dream," nor is he unable to part "substance from shadow." On the contrary, his sense of the college as "empty masks," is, in terms of the moral narrative, simply the truth. His last, very extended fit allows Ida to tend him with sympathy, and motivates her change toward a properly maternal, loving woman. And this seems to cure him of his illness (although it has been described as genetic): "lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead, My haunting sense of hollow shows: the change, This truthful change in thee has killed it." (7.327-329) Ida kills his true, spasmodic effeminacy, even though she is, as a woman, unable to adopt a false, killing, militaristic masculinity. Once again, The Princess wants to look like a mixed-up medley, but it is ac- tually determinedly unbalanced, asymmetrical, and, in many respects, profoundly immoderate. The masculinist framework sets down the laws, but there are darknesses that cannot be controlled. We can easily imagine a gloom- ily Foucauldian reading which would show that this darkness is ulti- mately part of the controlling discourse, but we will tentatively opt instead for a more identifiably feminist conclusion that suggests that these blank regions are signs that totalizing control is not and cannot be achieved. The framework of the first lines places the poem in daylight hours (just as Arthur, in Idylls of the King, knows that he will rule only "for a space"): Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun Up to the people. (P, 11. 1-3)</page><page sequence="19">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON /251 The poem ends in a sunset, expectedly, but there are dusks and nights cast all through it. Specifically, the songs which come between the numbered sections, and which are relegated to the women, are always associated with dusk or the nocturnal.30 The borders of the poem, therefore, - between parts and at the end - are dark. Threshold im- ages are shadowy: the death-threat "deep in shadow," the Prince's fits between "substance and shadow," the cloudy mood that comes over Ida before she casts off her "false self," even the Prince's concluding promise: O we will walk this world, Yoked in all exercise of noble end, And so through those dark gates across the wild That no man knows. (7-339-342) The Princess closes down on feminine knowledge, by transgressing its borders, and by re-describing the women. But it also seems to admit (knowingly?) that there are limits to what description can bind. Blanche is the blank, empty explanation for the aspect of the femi- nine that cannot be seen in the masculine light of day. We can imagine, then, a variety of conclusions, each of which would help to shape the course of an argument, like a "strange diagonal." But it seems more true to the "darkness" we see and feel to leave more systematic conclusions open to the reader. True, this sort of essay leads one to suspect the deviousness of such categories as "- variety," "ambiguity," and even "openness." But we will, nonetheless, end in the spirit and words of Luce Irigaray: "The problem is to break down the walls around the (male) one who speaks, sees, thinks, and thereby confers being upon himself, in a prison of self-sufficiency and a clarity made of the shadows of denial." In this mysterious night, amid this "nocturnal wandering," "what is expected is neither a this nor a thaty not a here any more than a there. No being, no places are designated. So the best plan is to abstain from all discourse, to keep quiet, or else utter only a sound so inarticulate that it barely forms a song"31</page><page sequence="20">252/ VICTORIAN POETRY Notes i George Eliot, "Notes on Form in Art" (1868), in Selected Essays, Poems, and Other Writings, ed.

Francis Barker, and others [Colchester: Univ. of Essex, 1978], pp. 97*106) begins with astute comments on the strategy of "medley" and on the important role of the mother in The Princess. His Lacanian reading that follows, however, strikes us as rather bizarre and not particularly useful. In a strong essay, Isolde Karen Herbert also sees the poetic frame as falsifying: "As a means to express, yet control, revolutionary social ideas, Tennyson's frame is an enclosure that, contrary to the overt subject of the work, constrains social and linguistic freedom within its monophonic voice" ("'A Strange Diagonal': Ideology and Enclosure in the Framing Sections of The Princess and The Earthly Paradise" VP 29 [1991]: 145*146). Another essay in the realm of ideological critique is Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, "Tennyson's Princess: One Bride for Seven Brothers," in Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1985). Sedgwick studies mainly the relation between men; we study mainly the relation between women and men. 13 In some ways our work here will seem quite recognizable; that is, we understand that aesthetic representation may all be prescriptive even when it seems to be descriptive. Thus Alice Jardine writes, "The process of representation, the sorting out of identity and difference, is the process of analysis, naming, controlling, remembering, understanding. A process so seemingly natural to us as to be beyond question. Yet, in France it has been diagnosed as being at the very roots of our Western desire to know all . . . ; it has been denounced as complicitous with a violence as old as Western history itself" (Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity [Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1985], p. 118). On the other hand, as Mieke Bal observes, there is not that much theoretical criticism which addresses itself specifically to description (cf. for bibliography, Mieke Bal, Reading "Rembrandt" : Beyond the Word-Image Opposition [New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1991], pp. 41, 407, n. 40). In studies of Victorian literature, perhaps the most interesting work is Helena Michie, "Body, Figure, Embodiment: The Paradoxes of Heroine Description" in The Flesh Made Word: Female Figures and Women's Bodies (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1987), pp. 79-123. On textual self-definition, see Ross Chambers, "Self- Situation and Readability" in Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1984), pp. 18-49. 14 The use of description to contain energy would seem to problematize the age-old virtues of enargeia. According to classical and Renaissance poetics, enargeia is the quality of animation that allows the reader to visualize a scene; in his review of The Princess, J. W. Marston speaks in terms that follow from this tradition: "A scene follows which, though unequal and in some parts tedious, contains much vivid description" (Tennyson: The Critical Heritage, ed. John D. Jump [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967], p. 169). However, there is a sense in The Princess that description is used to contain energy, and so to deaden the object as much as make it vivid. For a brief discussion of classical enargeia with bibliography, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, The Rhetoric of Space: Literary and Artistic Representations of Landscape in Republican and Augustan Rome (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1988), pp. 7-18.</page><page sequence="22">254/ VICTORIAN POETRY 15 For an important overview of triangular structures throughout Tennyson, see Gerhard Joseph, "Tennyson Choosing: The Three Women" in Tennyson and the Text: The Weaver's Shuttle (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992), pp. 161 * 190. For Joseph, the tripartite relationship of The Princess is a Jungian "psychomythic parable" (p. 189). 16 Paul de Man, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1984), p. 241. 17 These chains may be found in Naomi Schor, Breaking the Chain: Women, Theory, and French Realist Fiction (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1985). Also quite relevant here is Michael Ragussis, Acts of Naming: The Family Plot in Fiction (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1986), which works out the relation between the static name and the dynamic plot; for instance, "fiction upsets the family's (and the critic's) attempt to fix the identity of a character (especially a child) through a key name" (p. 11). Our essay is, by comparison, about the masculine attempt to fix women's identity through naming and description. 18 We will direct attention toward this plot structure in fiction below; in poetry, Mary Jacobus studies the relationship of Wordsworthian education to seduction in "'Behold the Parent Hen': Romantic Pedagogy and Sexual Difference," in Romanticism, Writing and Sexual Difference: Essays on "The Prelude" (Oxford: Clarendon, 1989), pp. 237-266. 19 Nancy Armstrong, Desire and Domestic Fiction: A Political History of the Novel (New York: Oxford Univ.

Peter Gay, "Offensive Women and Defensive Men," in The Bourgeois Experience: Victorian to Freud, vol. 1, The Education of the Senses (New York: Oxford Univ.

Press, 1990), p. 57. 25 This is also noticed by Rod Edmond, who has good paragraphs on the role of maternity in The Princess; but for him the poem is ultimately a "family narrative," where paternity is just as important, and the closest kin in Tennyson's canon is Enoch Arden (Affairs of the Hearth, p. 125). 26 Margaret Homans, Bearing the Word: Language and Female Experience in Nineteenth-Century Women's Writing (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1986) has much to say about the "literal," the "nonrepresentational," and the "presymbolic" communication between mother and daughter. The "literal" in her reading is to be valorized as a mode of representation over and against the usual privileging of the "metaphorical." Outside of its ability to describe them, Tennyson's poem relegates the women to darkness, song, the literal, silence, and the infantile, which is the space in</page><page sequence="23">KATHERINE FRANK AND STEVE DILLON /25s which many of Homans' women find voice. For instance, just as masculine law allows the women to sing only between the sections of the poem, Mrs. Ramsey's lullaby "is imagined as coming into being only beyond the frame of the text" (p. 286), and in between the acts, "Isa utters her fragments of poetry only silently and to herself, her utterances wedged in between interruptions caused by the demands of her place within her patriarchal family" (p. 19). 27 Christopher Ricks, Tennyson (New York: Macmillan, 1989), p. 185. 28 Ruth Bernard Yeazell, "Modest Blushing," in Fictions of Modesty: Women and Courtship in the English Novel (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1991), pp. 65-82. 29 "At the center of moral physiology is the concept of the will," writes Janet Oppenheim, "Shattered Nerves": Doctors, Patients, and Depression in Victorian England (Oxford: Oxford Univ.

Among many historians of medicine, including Foucault, see William F. Bynum, Jr., "Rationales for Therapy in British Psychiatry, 1780-1835," in Andrew Scull, Madhouses, Mad^Doctors and Madmen: The Social History of Psychiatry in the Victorian Era (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1981), pp. 35-57. The more recent language of self-control is clear in John Barlow, Man's Power Over Himself to Prevent or Control Insanity (London, 1843). "Recent discoveries" have been applied to rouse patients "to a certain degree of self-control by a system of kind and rational treatment, instead of the chains and whips of former times" (pp. 1-2). The combination of lucidity with madness is also brought forward: "If I am right in what I have advanced, a man may labour under a mental delusion, and yet be a responsible agent" (p. 13). 30 Just to authenticate this point: Section I ends with the Prince seeming "to float about a glimmering night"; the song after 2 is a lullaby, "Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep"; the song after 3 is about dusk, "till the Sun / Grew broader towards his death and fell"; the end of 4 wraps the Prince in a simile, " I was one / To whom the touch of all mischance but came / As night to him that sitting on a hill / Sees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun / Set into sunrise"; the song after 5 takes place amid the Prince's shadowy fit, "darkness closed me; and I fell"; the song between 6 and 7 begins, "Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea." 31 "La Mysterique," in The Speculum of the Other Woman, trans.
