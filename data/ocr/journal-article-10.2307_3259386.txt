<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLOUGaBY: TIRE CYCLE OF TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS 89 III. THE CYCLE OF TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO T HE salient facts concerning the picturing of the Apocalypse in East Christian art are these: 1. There was a simple and impressive symbolic tradition of Apo- calypse illustration in the earliest Christian art, represented best in Roman monuments dating from the second century to the sixth. Following the fifth century the Roman apocalypse tradition became steadily more literal and detailed. 2. Among Western manuscripts of the medieval period there is a vast welter of fully illustrated Apocalypses. Certain series among them record influences emanating from the Christian East. 3. The art of Byzantium featured in various media an elabor- ately organized pageant of the Last Judgment. This eschatological theme, however, must be differentiated sharply from the illustra- tion of the Apocalypse. In New Testament manuscripts it appeared only in connection with the Gospels. 4. Only the very scantiest remnants of an apocalypse cycle of miniatures are extant in Byzantine manuscripts today. 5. In Slavonic art, and more particularly in Russian art of the late sixteenth and the entire seventeenth century, there was a most elaborate development of minute scenes illustrating the Apo- calypse. Into this clearly defined framework of developments in art his- tory the astonishing cycle of sixty-nine miniatures in the Eliza- beth Day McCormick Apocalypse' must be fitted. Its value is to 1 See the detailed description of this singular manuscript by Professor Ernest Cadman Colwell in the preceding article.</page><page sequence="2">90 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE be estimated against the background of the meagerness of such materials from the East Christian area, and the contrasting abun- dance of Apocalypse illustrations in Western manuscripts. The Roman use of apocalyptic symbolism derived from the Revelation of John may be traced to the second century A.D. Among the earliest Christian inscriptions in the Priscilla Cemetery on the Via Salaria, there appears painted in red on tiles a single name "Modestina" and two letters derived from the Apocalypse, A and Q.2 Taken together these letters symbolize the faith of Modestina in one who was to her at once the beginning and the end of all things. With striking appropriateness this inscription is the very first monument recorded in Marucchi's Manual of Christian Epigraphy.3 It is the earliest extant bit of epigraphic Christian symbolism derived from the Johannine Apocalypse. In the fourth century and in the Catacomb of Peter and Mar- cellinus, this simple but all-inclusive apocalyptic symbol is found in a pictorial composition in conjunction with an impressive figure symbol, also derived from Revelation-the Lamb standing on Mount Zion.4 This is indubitably the heavenly Lamb of John's vision in Rev. 14 iff. To put the matter beyond all question of doubt, the four rivers of Paradise were represented in the catacomb fresco as flowing down the sides of Mt. Zion. In the same century the Lamb standing on Mt. Zion was depicted in mosaic in the apsidal composition of Santa Pudenziana, a mosaic that Victor Schultze called "the first great Christian religious composition known to us."5 Then, a century and a half later, came the apse mosaic of S S Cosmas and Damian (526-30), its frieze 2 Joseph Wilpert, ,,Beitrige zur christlichen Archiologie," Rdmische Quartalschrift fiur christliche Altertumskunde, XX (1906), 14f., P1.

This processional arrangement set the mode; and thereafter in several well-known Roman churches the apocalyptic Lamb on Mt. Zion held his place at the center of the apsidal frieze. So in Santa Prassede, in San Marco, and in Santa Cecilia, all of the ninth century. As early as the fifth century the use of apocalyptic symbolism in the art of Christian Rome was impressively supplemented by the literal reproduction of actual scenes described in Revelation. The Adoration of the Lamb or of the Divine Majesty narrated in the fourth and fifth chapters of the Apocalypse was the first of these great pageants to be pictured. About the beginning of the fifth century Prudentius, in his Diptychon, described a cycle of twenty-four scenes from the New Testament used to decorate the side and end walls of a basilica. The last scene of all, located at the apse, was the Adoration of the Lamb from the Apocalypsis Johannis: "Bis duodena senem sedes, pateris citharisque Totque coronarum fulgens insignibus, Agnum Caede cruentatum laudat: qui euolvere librum Et septem potuit signacula pandere solus."7 In A.D. 440 Pope Leo I embellished the fagade of Old Saint Peter's with an adoration scene focused on the figure of the heav- enly Christ surrounded by the four apocalyptic creatures of Eze- kiel and Revelation.8 At the end of the seventh century Pope Sergius I (687--701) restored this mosaic and substituted the Apocalyptic Lamb in a medallion, for the anthropomorphic figure of the heavenly Christ. Hartmann Grisar has shown that this sub- stitution was a direct Roman reaction against the decree of the Council of Constantinople in 692, which prohibited the representa- tion of Christ under the form of a Lamb.9 It was a monumental 6 Berchem and Clouzot, Op. cit., pp. 119-124, Figs. 138, 139, 142; Wilpert, Die R6mischen Mosaiken, III, PIs. 102, 104. 7 Prudentius, Dittochaeum, XLIX. 8 Wilpert, Die Rdmi8chen Mosaiken, I, 358-76, Fig. 117. 9 H.

Incidentally, of course, the decree of Constantinople attests the considerable employment of the symbolic Lamb in East Chris- tian art previous to 692. Leo I also commissioned the creation of the adoration mosaic that was the glory of the triumphal arch in St. Paul's Outside the Walls.o0 The well-known engraving of Ciampini shows us the orig- inal composition, with the worshipping elders, as it existed in ruined state at the end of the 17th century (1690). This engraving also assures us that the restoration of a century ago, after the great fire of 1823, was along the lines of the ancient design. In addition to these famous adoration pageants on the great basilicas of Rome, there is a possible fifth century record of a cycle of scenes drawn from the Apocalypse. The Historiae Ravenna- tum of Hieronymus Rubeus under the year 433 mentions that Galla Placidia placed on the walls of her church of St. John the Evangelist in Ravenna, pictures of "the seven candlesticks and some other mysteries in addition, from the matters described in the Apocalypse."" The statement is about as vague as it could be made; but it seems to have in view a series of apocalypse illustra- tions. At the end of the seventh century, however, there is definite attestation of an extended Roman cycle of apocalypse pictures. The Venerable Bede tells us in his Vitae Abbatum 5, that Benedict Biscop brought back from Rome a series of pictorial compositions for the decoration of his own St. Peter's at Wearmouth. He speci- fied particularly that "images of the Visions of the Apocalypse of St. John" were to be placed on the north wall of the Wearmouth church, just as the scenes from gospel history were designated for the south wall. Thus literary and monumental evidence combine to show that Rome early developed a symbolic tradition of apocalypse illustra- 10 Wilpert, Die R6mischen Mosaiken, II, 548-58, Figs. 184--87; Ber- chem and Clouzot, Op. cit., pp. 87-90, Figs. 100, 101. 11 Septemque candelabra et nonnulla praeterea ex iis quae in Apocalypsi discribuntur mysteria.</page><page sequence="5">WILLOUGHBY: THE CYCLE OF TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS 93 tion; and that later, while continuing the use of symbols, she also developed a representative tradition that found expression in a series of pictures illustrating the Apocalypse. It is argued that if artistic tradition in the Roman West was as definite as this re- garding the Apocalypse, there must have been corresponding de- velopments in the Greek East. A study of the vast mass of illustrated Apocalypses that origi- nated in the West during the medieval period gives credence to this point of view; for there are apocalyptic cycles in Western manuscripts that display the effects of Eastern influences. In con- trast to the great dearth of Apocalypse scenes in Byzantine art, Revelation was more than popular in the Latin West for the pic- turesque subjects it provided the illustrator.12 The Psalms and the Gospels alone had more of artistry lavished upon them. The tide of miniatured apocalypses began to rise in the Carolingian period, when a long and interesting series of illustrations was already devised. It was at flood tide during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and it did not ebb until the fifteenth. The codices illus- trated presented the text, either in Latin or in vernacular trans- lation, and usually with a commentary as well. Sometimes, how- ever, the pictures were the main content of the volume and only enough text was added to provide descriptions for the paintings. Provost Montague Rhodes James of Eton, the great authority on western apocalypses, lists between ninety and one hundred of these pictured codices, and adds the warning that his list is in- complete.13 Two western series of Apocalypse scenes may be cited as record- ing reflections of East Christian influences; the Catalonian Apo- calypse cycle in the Beatus manuscripts, and the Alsacian series in the Hortus Deliciarum by Herrade of Landsberg. The Beatus manuscripts constitute an unusually compact group of about thirty codices, dating from the ninth to the twelfth 12 J. A.

The oldest manuscript of the group, written by the scribe Magius in 894, is today in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York City, having passed through the Ashburnham and Yates Thompson collections.15 Both in number and theme the Beatus miniatures are almost unvarying from manuscript to manuscript. The pictures are pro- fuse; about seventy for the Apocalypse, and twelve for the book of Daniel. This, in itself, argues for a common prototype. Add to this the fact that Beatus miniatures are characterized by impressive excellence of composition, together with pronounced ineptitude of technique, and the work of copyists is demonstrated. Whence came the archetype for the Beatus sequence of miniatures ? Most schol- ars look to the Near East for it; and many scholars make allow- ance for early Byzantine influences in explaining the genesis of this puzzling complex. Perfectly obvious and very pronounced are the Byzantine in- fluences exhibited in the twelfth century Hortus Deliciarum, by Herrade of Landsberg, who was Abbess of Hohenburg in Alsace, 1167-96.16 This exceedingly important and very delightful com- pilation was a sort of encyclopedia of contemporary religious knowledge, produced for the edification of the nuns under Herrade's charge. It was illustrated with a congeries of symbolic and scrip- tural subjects, the latter extending from Genesis to Revelation. There were three hundred and thirty-three miniatures in the manu- script when it left Herrade's hands; but the codex was completely destroyed during the siege of Strassburg in 1870. Fortunately, two hundred and twenty-eight of its scenes had previously been 14 L. Delisle, MXlanges de Paldographie et de Bibliographie (Paris: Cham- pion, 1880), pp. 117-147; W.

Among them are twenty miniatures depicting scenes from the Apocalypse. Greek influences are most patent in the scriptural scenes, many of them being exactly like well-known depictions of these very subjects on Byzantine monuments. In general, amplitude of com- position, sureness of conception, distinctive iconography, and a stylistic neo-Hellenism, signalize the Byzantine elements in these compositions. Of the novel and fascinatingly varied Revelation cycle in Her- rade's Hortus Deliciarum only two miniatures are here commented on; one for its epigraphic record of Greek background, and the other for its combination of uniqueness and Byzantine character. The Woman in the Sun of Revelation 12 is drawn to ample scale." Above, her new born child is snatched away to God. Below, in the left, the Beast rises from the sea, its sword raised to strike the saints before him. On that sword is a Greek inscription O Al (o v7-lXpLo--ror). Below, on the right, the Dragon sweeps down the stars of heaven with his tail and vomits forth water. And the Dra- gon also is identified with a Greek designation, transliterated into Latin: Drako eptakephalus (Apa'Kwv E7-rtaKE(/aXog). Unique among the Herrade miniatures is the depiction of the promise in Rev. 21 3, 4. "And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes."s18 It is a very Byzantine God who performs this com- forting service. To the right the redeemed in Paradise stand by the river of life, with the tree of life on either side (Rev. 22 iff.). The double tree of life follows indubitable Byzantine models; and the Saints are the Oranti of Roman catacomb paintings. Such definite repetitions of Byzantine types in the Apocalypse cycles of the West would seem to be clear proof that at one time the Christian East also had its sequence of text illustrations for the Book of Revelation. A closely related eschatological theme for which the Byzantines exhibited great cordiality was the vast panorama of the Last Judgment.19 One of the earlier and more rudimentary organiza- 17 Straub and Keller, Op. cit., Pl.

The main features of the developed Byzantine picturization of the Last Judgment are well known from a number of monuments in various media. None of them is more justly famous than the great mosaic of the twelfth century in the fine old basilica at Tor- cello, with its various zones centering in the crucifixion, the Ana- stasis, the Deesis, the Etimasia, the angel of judgment, and the gates to Hades and Paradise.21 In Byzantine churches these pageants of doom were assigned the whole of the west wall of the church, facing the apse. But in the post Byzantine period, as on Mt. Athos, the frescoes of the Last Judgment were relegated to the refectories, where they were in a conspicuous position to furnish moral warnings and inducements to the monks at their meals. Thus in the early sixteenth century (1512) the Laura Trapeza was frescoed with a vast judgment scene, and during the last half of the same century (1547-1603), a less ambitious composition was painted at Dionysiu.22 This favored Byzantine composition of the Last Judgment, however, must be clearly differentiated from the illustration of the Apocalypse.

Instead it was used in connection with the doom chapters in the synoptic Gospels. Repeatedly in completely illus- trated gospels, such as Paris 74 and Laur. VI 23 and their Slavonic congeners, the judgment scene appears-however inappropriately -as a gospel illustration. 23Moreover, the literary origins for the multitude of scenes combined into the total pageant of doom were mainly non-canonical rather than canonical sources. Specifically the details, in large proportion, were taken from the late fourth century Apocalypse of Paul and the ninth century Apocalypse of Mary, rather than from the first century Apocalypse of John. Moreover, the Last Judgment pageant was so huge and complex an arrange- ment that, in the very nature of the case, it could never be at home in the limited space provided by a manuscript folio. Accordingly, the Byzantine development of the Last Judgment scene cannot be cited as a matter of Apocalypse illustration. At the very most it exhibits the interest of the Byzantines in eschatological sub- jects; and at the very least it shows that they were not adverse to the contemplation of apocalyptic scenes. When, however, we turn to discover actual illustrations of the Apocalypse in Greek manuscripts, the findings are scanty almost to the vanishing point. Provost James in his Schweich Lectures before the British Academy in 1927 affirmed: "I have hitherto failed to find any indication that the Apocalypse as a separate book with pictures existed in Greek lands. Not even in the form of marginal illustrations of a New Testament."24 Later in a personal letter Provost James repeated the same statement and added "I can't account for it." In 1929 appeared H. C. Hoskier's monumental volumes Con- cerning the Text of the Apocalypse in which three miniatured Greek Apocalypses were described, each with a scanty cycle of four mar- ginal vignettes, the series being identical each with the others.25 23 Henri Omont, Evangiles avec Peintures Byzantines du XIe sidcle (Paris: Bertaud Freres, 1908), P1. 41; Sirarpie Der Nersessian, "Two Sla- vonic Parallels of the Greek Tetraevangelia: Paris 74," Art Bulletin, IX, No. 3 (March, 1927), pp. 247f., Figs. 24-26. 24 James, Apocalypse in Art, p. 74. 25 H.

Second came the animal from the sea "with ten horns and seven heads, and ten diadems on its horns. ... Its feet like a bear's, and its mouth like a lion's mouth" (Rev. 13 iff.). Third was the other animal from the land, with two horns like a lamb, but with the aspect and utterance of a dragon (Rev. 13 11). Fourth appeared the scarlet woman on the scarlet animal with the seven horns and ten heads, the woman holding in her hand a gold cup filled with the impurities of her immorality (Rev. 17 sff.). Until the Apocalypse of Maximos the Peloponnesian was found by Miss McCormick in Paris last March, this slight sequence of four miniatures, preserved in three manuscripts, was the full ex- tent of Greek Apocalypse illustration known to scholarship. The importance of Miss McCormick's discovery may fairly be esti- mated by checking the cycle of sixty-nine miniatures in her manu- script against the tiny group of four miniatures recorded by Hoskier. Even so, this attenuated quartet is enough to prove that there did exist a Greek Apocalypse cycle in manuscripts of the Byzan- tine period. Obviously it was not a popular cycle, else more of it would be extant today. Codex 2400, with its unique group of twelve miniatures illustrating the Book of Acts, attests a greater popularity for the second Lucan cycle, even. Just why the Byzantines neglected Apocalypse illustration to this extent has been the occasion of much conjecture. The late N. P. Kondakoff, for example, advanced this labored explana- tion: "The fact is that the allegorical sense of the pictures that make up the Apocalypse hardly lends itself to plastic represen- tation, and can hardly be understood without inscriptions. Also Greek feeling was against the literal reproduction which satisfied the barbarous taste of the west up to the eleventh century.""26 To us it seems that the obvious reason for negligence in this matter was that the Apocalypse itself was not a popular book ritch, 1929), I, 464.

Its canonical standing was precarious among the Orthodox. Today only about two hundred and twenty-five Greek texts of the Apocalypse are extant, as against ten times as many straight texts of the Gospels. Neverthe- less, it is clear that sometimes Greek manuscripts of the Apocalypse were illustrated. Two great Apocalypse cycles among the murals of Athos further point to Byzantine prototypes. These two sequences are identical in theme and composition. They include twenty distinct subjects. The murals in the Dionysiu Trapeza are dated 1547 and those in the vestibule at Xenophon were painted in 1633, presumably from cartoons of the earlier series.27 The Dionysiu murals particularly are admirable exemplifications of the artistry of the Cretan school; elegant, sophisticated, schematized, heraldic. They are organized as separate tableaux, each painted in a rectangular frame. This format in itself points to a model composition derived from the page of a codex. On the other hand, there is an observable ten- dency to bring together similar subjects into a single composition. The Four Horsemen, for example, ride together in one picture, whereas in a codex they would almost inevitably be portrayed separately on four folios. In such instances the Athos series shows the adaptation of a miniature sequence to the demands and possi- bilities of mural painting. The testimony of the much exploited Painter's Manual of Diony- sius of Fourna agrees in the main with the evidence presented by the Athos murals.28 Twenty-four apocalyptic scenes are prescribed in the manual, most of them including main features actuallypainted in the Athos sequences. The murals and manual between them may fairly be taken as preserving the wall painter's version of an earlier Byzantine miniature cycle. The one area in Eastern Christendom where miniatured manu- scripts of the Apocalypse thrived and multiplied was in Russia from the end of the sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth century. 29 Then and there the Apocalypse grew vastly in favor as 27 Millet, Op. cit., Pls. 184, 185, 206-9. 28 Dionysius of Fourna, CEprlvela TrvE ZoypattfK i XVrvr.

From the sixteenth century on, there was a great output of Russian illustrated apocalypses, each carrying a cycle of seventy miniatures. The flood continued among the Old Believers through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until very recent times. Representative examples of these manuscripts were published by F. I. Buslaieff in 1884.30 These miniatures show the influence of Diirer's great engravings of the Apocalypse, to be sure; but the survivals of Byzantine style and iconography are even more unmistakable. The control of these illustrated Apocalypses on the Russian art of icon painting was remarkable; for they furnished the foundation of the minute manner of composition in small compartments or long tiers. At the very least forty compartments were needed for the comprehensive illustration of the Apocalypse. On triptychs, since the Last Judgment already held the central panel, the Apo- calypse friezes had to be placed on the two side wings, as is shown in an excellent example from the Old Believers Church near the Rogozh Cemetery in Moscow.31 Sometimes the text of Revelation was broken into sections, and only a few chapters were depicted on one icon, the various panels being hinged together at the sides in the manner of a folding screen. An example from the collection of S. D. Sillin illustrates this tour de force.32 Finally facility was devel- oped in disposing the multifarious scenes of the Apocalypse in a single, synthetic landscape. An early nineteenth century icon from the Likhacheff collection is an admirable exemplar of this unitary method of composition.33 But the tax on the skill of the icon painter was too great, and to the end illustrated Russian Apocalypses re- mained more popular than apocalyptic icons. What was the derivation of the Russian miniatured Apocalypse ? Kondakoff, in commenting on the appeal of the eschatological point of view to the Russian mind, declares: "This was reinforced 30 F. I.

CCCXVII.</page><page sequence="14">WILLOUGHBY: THE CYCLE OF TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS 101 by the fact that just these subjects were coming in from Greece and the Balkans, where they dominated icon painting at the end of the sixteenth century and all the seventeenth."34 Space does not suffice for demonstration, but our thesis is that the McCormick Apocalypse is an example of precisely the Greek models that stimulated this singular development in the history of Russian icon painting. From this perspective, the Maximos codex has enhanced significance, not only as an all but solitary survivor of the Byzantine Apocalypse cycle, but also as a liaison between that cycle and the more recent miniatured Apocalypses in Russia. This great gap in art history the Maximos Apocalypse supplies with a cycle of miniatures that is almost complete. All the KEu0Nala of Andreas of Caesarea are illustrated save three only: 38, con- cerning the Number of the Beast; 65, concerning the New Heaven and the New Earth; and 69, concerning the Messiah as God of the Prophets and Master of the Angels.35 These omissions are regret- table; but one of the most impressive features of Miss McCormick's Apocalypse is the inclusiveness of its cycle of sixty-nine miniatures, all save one being direct and detailed illustrations of adjacent texts. What is most surprising and most gratifying is the fact that the codex has apparently lost not a single miniature in all its varied history. Its tableaux are arranged in two grand sequences, approximately equal in number, the final group being the work of the master of the atelier, who was also a consummate master of the art of miniature painting. His creations are distinguished by chromatic harmonization, surety of line, compositional balance, and exquisite finesse. The first sequence was completed by the master's assistants, who followed different models and used different palettes. Their work is interesting, and some of it is amusing. All the miniatures are carefully arranged in minor sequences that coincide exactly with the literary structure of the Book of Revelation itself. The group of miniatures devoted to the introductory messages to the churches begins with the seer's commission to write (6 v., Rev. 1 9-20). It is a highly ecclesiastized scene, the right side being 4 Kondakoff, Op. cit., p. 196. 35 J. P.

John, at his writ- ing among the candle stands at the left, is quite insignificant by comparison. The near identity in composition among these ecclesiastical scenes is interrupted at the message to the church in Smyrna (15 r, Rev. 2 8-11), by the well-known John-Prochorus picture, a tableau that appears first of all as a frontispiece to the fourth gospel in the tenth century, and is revived again for the same function in the fourteenth. The Maximos miniature, which is very dramatic and emotional, derives from one of these later Paleolo- gan renditions (Fig. 1). A superior miniature in the ecclesiastical group is the message to Sardis (24 r, Rev. 3 1-6), where the Existent One holds the seven spirits of God enshrined in a golden disc. Christ is here designated ' OEed'vOpConro "the god-man," and the basilica at the upper left is labelled specifically eKKXWl'a. The half-black back- ground in this and others of the church miniatures is a most un- usual arrangement, but very effective. Tableaux depicting the visions of the heavenly throne in chap- ters 4 and 5 come to a culmination in the colorful pageant where the company of four and twenty elders fall down before the throne in adoration, and deposit their crowns, while the slaughtered lamb above prepares to break the seals and open the book of doom (44 r, Rev. 5 6-14). In these and succeding miniatures the backgrounds are a solid and flat blue, a most satisfactory color for the purpose. The Four Horsemen in the Maximos codex ride on separate pages. Their horses are very aristocratic animals with bright eyes, small heads, and knotted tails. The seven horned lamb above on its bench-like throne, breaking successive seals to the evident alarm of the apocalyptic animals, is probably the least convincing creature on the page. Following the silence after the breaking of the seventh seal, the seven angels of wrath, with their trumpets, array themselves be- fore the altar of heaven (72 v., Rev. 8 2-6). The miniature is out of sequence. But a conscientious rubricator has noted the error in the margin, and advised the reader to turn back six pages to find the correct miniature.</page><page sequence="16">WILLOUGHBY: THE CYCLE OF TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS 103 In their actual performances the angels of wrath are rather crudely done; with bold, raw colors and loose outlines. The plague of the demonic horsemen, instigated by the sixth angel (82 v., Rev. 9 13-21), is the most disquieting of these compositions. Its dusky array of hideous riders on lion-headed horses, contrasts effectively with the border of angel heads along the River Euphrates in the right foreground. Easily the most amusing figure in the McCormick Apocalypse is the mighty angel, with the rainbow around his shoulders, the cloud about his body, and his legs like pillars of fire (85 v., Rev. 10 1-3). In sympathy let us add that probably no other figure in these visions put such demands on the artist as did this angel. The immediate result of John's attempt to digest the angel's book is the vision of the two potent prophets brought face to face with the red and green monster out of the abyss (92 v., Rev. 11 3-7a). Here, because the colored background is omitted altogether, the figures stand out in bold silhouettes. The colorful monster is roundly modelled. The cosmic struggle between God and the dragon is epitomized by the portent of the Woman in the Sun, tormented by the fire-red dragon (98 v., Rev. 12 1-5). Chromatically this is one of the most astonishing miniatures in the codex, with the woman's figure framed in an orange-red mandorla that flames against a grey-blue background. In frankness we have to say, however, that the pic- ture has been repainted fairly recently. The vision of the Lamb on Mt. Zion, followed by 144,000 of the redeemed, initiates the great series of scenes painted by the master miniaturist (114 v., Rev. 14 1-5). Mt. Zion is boldly eroded and sharply sloped; and the irreproachable celibates who follow the Lamb, are individualized and well characterized. Impending judgment is actually initiated by a mighty angel who reaps the earth from a cloud in mid-air (Fig. 2), and by another angel from the temple of heaven who reaps the grape harvest for the wine press of God's wrath (125 v., Rev. 14 17-2o). The decora- tive handling of plant forms in these designs is a most pleasing feature. Next, the angels with the seven plagues gather at the sea of glass mingled with fire, and facing them from the other side are</page><page sequence="17">104 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the victorious saints with strange musical instruments in their hands (127 v., Rev. 151-4). The line work, by which water is rendered, is one of the very rhythmic features of these miniatures. Perhaps the Plague of Darkness is the most successful tableau in this catastrophic sequence (134 v., Rev. 1610ob.). The darkness is murky; yet it does not obliterate the figures of the men who gnaw their red tongues in their bitter anguish. As the chapter headings in Andreas require, there are two de- pictions of the scarlet woman on the scarlet animal; in one min- iature the angel shows John the portent, and in the other he inter- prets its meaning. Details as always are exact: the seven heads and ten horns of the animal, the golden cup, and scarlet robe, and jewels of the harlot. Even the persistent purpose of God is symbolized by the all-seeing eye. The millennium, which is a peculiar feature of Revelation among canonical apocalypses, is accorded a distinctive miniature in the McCormick codex (163 v., Rev. 20 4b-6). Above, in a zone of the starry heavens, are the saints raised to reign with the Messiah. Below are the rest of the dead, waiting in the depths of the earth for the final resurrection. At the beginning of the last group of miniatures the enthroned God and the seer are depicted together, alone, and face to face. The seer is instructed to write out the great message of Revelation: "See! I am making everything new!" (171 v., Rev. 21 5-8). Un- deniably the simplicity of the composition enhances the impressive- ness of the message. The climax, among the McCormick miniatures, is achieved in the depiction of the tree and river of life (180 v., Rev. 22 if.). For decorative stylization, rhythmic pattern-work, balanced organi- zation of space, and restrained coloration, this miniature is un- equalled. Other miniatures follow it; but this is the real culmination of the series. Because of the extreme importance of the McCormick Apocalypse cycle, a prospectus is appended giving an enumeration and listing the titles of all the scenes illustrated. Should this lead to the dis- covery of yet other miniatured Greek Apocalypses, no one would be happier than Miss McCormick herself.
