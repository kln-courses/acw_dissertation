<plain_text><page sequence="1">Academy of Management Journal SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS: MANAGING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION Anil K. Gupta, University of Maryland Ken G. Smith, University of Maryland Christina E. Shalley, Georgia Institute of Technology Overview It is generally accepted that continued long term development and performance, whether it be at the individual, group or organizational level, requires the effective management of two interrelated processes: exploration or the search for new opportunities and the accumulation of new knowledge and routines, and exploitation or the appropriation of value from existing opportunities, knowledge, and routines. Exploration without exploitation implies upfront investments in learning without the prospect of corresponding returns and, thus, may not be valuable or rewarding over a continued period of time. On the other hand, exploitation without exploration may result in declining value over time because of the erosion of existing knowledge and skills through competitive processes and changing environmental conditions. What is less clear is how these processes should be managed and balanced. This special forum is an effort to identify the relationship between exploration and exploitation and to explore how these processes should be managed and balanced across different levels of analysis. The terms "exploration and exploitation" invoke different images for micro and macro researchers, yet they are very meaningful for both. Therefore, we seek a range of articles that span these areas and contribute across levels of analysis. Despite the obvious symbiosis between exploration and exploitation, research on these issues has tended to study these two processes in isolation rather than jointly. For example, the literature on competitive advantages has emphasized sustaining existing advantages at the expense of creating new advantages. Much of the literature on creativity has emphasized the process of learning, search, and discovery without attention to appropriation. As a consequence, there is a need to improve our understanding of how individuals, groups, and firms manage, balance and give attention to these processes over time. There is also a need to identify how both individual factors (personality, experience, knowledge, skills, ability) and contextual factors (components of the job, supervisory demands/support, group or organizational climate, organizational size, technology, struc ture and environments) influence how these processes are managed and controlled. Finally, there is a need to improve our understanding of the consequences of alternative strategies for the management of exploration and exploitation at all levels of analysis. We expect scholars from a broad range of disciplines to submit to this special research forum. For example, we encourage scholars with an interest in creativity, innovation, and learning to join forces with scholars from organizational behavior, human resource management, and strategic management to achieve an integrated advance. In addition, we also seek papers from meso researchers on this subject. For example, micro research ers might work with macro scholars to connect individual processes of creativity and learning, with organi zational processes through which organizations also seek to exploit such outcomes, resulting in, for example, innovations. Furthermore, we imagine that the management of these processes will be different across alternative cultures; thus the topic should be of interest to a global audience. Research Questions We invite empirical contributions that examine the interplay between exploration and exploitation in any of a variety of possible contexts. Special topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: How similar or different are the requirements for succeeding at exploration vs. exploitation? How might these processes differ across different units of analysis (individuals, groups, organizations)? Can the same individual, team, or organization do both tasks effectively? If so, must these processes be managed concurrently, or sequentially? Does it depend on what stage of the process, firm, or industry we are involved in? Specifically, are there different stages in the evolution of different jobs, projects, organiza tions, or industries when one may be more desirable than another? How does an individual's, group's, or firm's prior history with exploration and exploitation determine the extent of inertia in moving from exploitation to exploration or vice versa? Is the inertia or freedom of movement between exploration and exploitation contingent on other endogenous and/or exogenous 621</page><page sequence="2">factors? What are the political implications of exploitation, particularly when it is done by those not involved in the actual exploration and vice versa? What is the role of risk? How do individuals, groups, and organizations balance taking risks and dealing with failure in order to learn and to be more creative? What processes have to be in place to support exploration versus exploitation? When is exploration desirable and when does it lead to diminishing returns? When is it more advantageous to capitalize on existing resources and build effective routines rather than to search out new ways of doing things? Are there parallel processes between levels of analysis in the manner by which individuals, groups or organizations explore and exploit that could shed light and inform how these processes should be managed across levels of analysis? Does/must there exist "multiple skills" or a "division of labor" in the execution of exploration vs. exploitation tasks? If so, in what order and at what level (individual/team/department/business unit/ industry) might/should such specialization occur, and how should the two processes be coordinated? How does the rate of learning and innovation among other workers or the level of the technological innovation and competition in an industry affect the manner by which individuals/organizations cycle between exploitation and exploration? How do individuals, groups, or firms manage the transition in emphasis from exploration to exploitation and vice versa as they evolve over time? What are the triggers and contingencies that drive this transition process, and how might this transition process vary? At different stages of the creative or innovative process, are different types of people or skills required to be able to successfully explore or exploit? How can managers learn to recognize good ideas to exploit them? What happens when others choose to exploit the ideas of an individual or team? How do politics come into play in groups and firms in terms of when to share exploratory ideas and when they may be exploited by others? How do the corporate governance requirements for exploration and exploitation differ across levels of analysis and alternative types of organizational structures, organizations, environments, and cultures? How do the processes for knowledge accumulation by individuals, groups, and firms differ from and interact with those for knowledge diffusion? For example, how do the processes for knowledge acquisition differ from and interact with the processes of knowledge exploitation? What are the similarities, differences, and interactions between an individual's group's, or organization's "creative capacity," "diffusive capacity," "absorptive capacity," and "risk-taking capacity"? What are the consequences of being successful at exploration (or exploitation) but not exploitation (or exploration), and of being successful at both (or neither)? What are the contingencies that jointly impact the success of exploration and exploitation at different levels of analysis?

MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of about 75 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use boldface for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Sec ond-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use second- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS Data and Sample Measures Independent variable. Dependent variables. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested sep arately. Give it a distinct number (Hypothesis 1) or number letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key technical terms. A techni cal term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published schol ars) ascribe to it. Putting the first appearance of a word in quo tation marks can replace providing a definition for technical terms that are not key to your work. Example: We noted several instances of "voluntary turnover," but these were outside the focus of this study. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a vari able throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a \2 test." Do use mathematical symbols and numbers to report illus trative results and give formulas. In both, italicize letters that are customarily italicized, such as p, r, b, F, and Z. Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs. Illustrative results go in parentheses. The text introducing them should be a complete sentence. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Equations' presentation depends on their appearance and their role in your research. Generally, formulas that aren't key and equations used to estimate regression coefficients should be run into the text. However, formulas that contain oversized symbols or division cannot be run in. These, and some one 623</page><page sequence="4">624 Academy of Management Journal August line equations, should be displayed (centered). If you assign a number to a displayed equation, place it in parentheses, on the far right. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-kM\(Xtri ?i(Yt = ytxt) =-Y?r~' (1) where Yt is. . . . Your definition of each new term in the equation follows. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Be par ticularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager . . .he"), can imply gender-based discrimination. Using plural pronouns?changing "the manager ... he" to "managers . . . they"?usually helps. Active voice and first person. Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Avoid describing inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological details, such as explanations of the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Presentation should be concise. If you can, avoid table formats and exact reproductions of surveys. Lists with headings are fine. Look at published AMJs for models. Label multiple appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within appendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text or each other. Please carefully consider what each table or figure adds to your work. Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to get ideas for preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIGURE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and in boldface type, but in title style letters (upper and lower case). Number tables and figures consecutively (one series for tables, one for figures). Place tables and figures at the end of the manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed to achieve a neat, readable presentation. Please do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type or using abbrevia tions. Spell out the names of your variables. Don't use code names and abbreviations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizon tal row should contain only one type of data. Label the data across the top or down the far-left side?not in the body. The body of your table should contain only data. In general, give ages and percentages as whole numbers, and report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left corners of their tables. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small let ters. A lettered footnote may be used to summarize signifi cance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. . . . To report significance levels one-by-one, indent separate footnotes under all your other footnotes. Use asterisks. Exam ple: *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 Unless you are reporting exact probabilities, keep to two lev els of significance. In all cases, use a single asterisk for the .05 level. More on figures. Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. If possible, our printer scans figures directly from the hard copy of your manuscript into the publication files. So make sure your figures will print out clearly. Place all words horizontally?avoid setting words parallel to your y-axis in a graph, and avoid vertical stacks of letters. Use the same full (not abbreviated) variable names you use in the text and tables. Citations Formal citations. These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifications of other research. Every work that has a cita tion needs to have a corresponding reference (see "Refer ences," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example just given. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation?Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Homer, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000).</page><page sequence="5">Subsequent citations?. . . even when random assign ment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers. To cite a direct quotation in running text, give its page after the year, separated from it by a space and a colon. Example: In-text quotation?Lee has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1998: 3). No author? For an article with no author, cite the periodi cal as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "corporate au thor" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corre sponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or corporate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding refer ence need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corpo rate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)
