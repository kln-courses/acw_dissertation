To these ideas of the book, with which the reviewer unfortunately (unfortunate for the present world situation) cannot disagree in most respects, one question may be asked: has the author ever considered that in the idea of love (in the sense of agape as emphasized by classical Christianity) the vertical line which character- izes the yogi and the horizontal line which char- acterizes the commissar might have found their fundamental union? PAUL TILLICH Union Theological Seminary Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines. By RENE GUENON. Translated by MARCO PALLIS. London: Luzac &amp; Co., I945. 35I pages. I2s. 6d. This book is more than what its title prom- ises. It is actually a methodological prolegome- non to the study of Eastern philosophical and religious thought. It contains reflections on the basic differences between Western and Eastern concepts of knowledge and develops rules for the interpretation of Eastern sources. Thus it is one of the not too numerous contributions to the hermeneutics of religious and philosophical ex- pressions in the East intended to help to safe- guard an adequate and "unbiased" understand- ing of the oriental mind. The translator, in his Foreword, points out that only the third part actually is concerned with Hindu doctrine; the other sections are of a general character, ap- plicable to other Eastern cultures. The book is divided into four parts, the first dealing with such preliminary questions as that of the difference of Western and Eastern mentality, with the "classical prejudice," and the problems of chronology and language. The second, and per- haps most important, section is devoted to the analysis of the basic categories of Eastern thought, discussing the divisions of the oriental world, the principles of unity of its civilizations, the meaning of tradition, symbolism, esoteric and exoteric knowledge, the relations between metaphysics, to which paramount importance is attributed, and theology as well as philoso- phy. In the third part the author explains the nature of Hinduism, its sources and principles and main schools, while devoting the last to Western interpretations. Here "official oriental- ism," the science of religions, theosophism, and Westernized Vedanta come in for trenchant criticism. Mr. Guenon writes curn studio. He is thor- oughly disgusted with Western provincialism, especially the predilection of its scholars for classical (Greco-Roman) tradition and modes of thought, the narrowly philosophical procedure in their investigation of the East, the prevailing rationalism, intellectualism, naturalism, and historism which prevent an understanding of the metaphysical concepts on which oriental thought rests. In all these criticisms there is a good amount of truth. Guenon is here in agree- ment with scholars like H. Zimmer, W. E. Hocking, and F. S. C. Northrop, not to mention the Western Vedantists whom the author heart- ily dislikes.' However, he himself seems, to this reviewer, to lay himself open to two objections: though he admits that even the misguided West had once, in the Middle Ages possessed a differ-, ent orientation, he generalizes too indiscrimi- nately and finds hardly a just man among West- ern "sinners." But he can be so severe only be- cause he does not qualify. Characteristic is, for instance, his chapter on the science of religion in which Burnouf (!) and Comte are taken as "rep- resentative." Why not some contemporary au- thors? Furthermore, he omits to take cognizance of the fact that most of what we know is due to the painstaking studies of Western scholars, namely the censured philologists. A second blind spot is the author's equally unqualified praise of everything Eastern. Not one word is said in criticism of the rather obvious onesidedness of procedures, methods, and results of Eastern thought. Especially interesting is the discussion of the essential characteristics of metaphysics, the dis- tinction between metaphysics and the sciences, i.e., "all the particular and specialized sciences directed to the study of this or that determinate aspect of individual things" (p. i Io); the former "cannot contradict reason, but stands above it" (p. II6); metaphysics is derived from pure intel- lect, having the universal for its domain while scientific knowledge, derived from reason, deals with the general (p. Ii8). However, the author Cf. also C. A. Moore (ed.), Symposium on Phil- osophy East and West (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, I944), I36</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS tends, with his exaltation of metaphysics, to minimize religion with its "sentimental," "con- solatory," and anthropomorphic elements (pp. I24 ff.). This reviewer is not sure that the au- thor actually does justice to the religious char- acteristics of a theistic Hinduism or Mahayana Buddhism where the elements he criticizes in the religions of revelation abound. Every student of India will welcome the treatment of the six darshana or philosophical "viewpoints" in Hinduism and of their ter- minology (chaps. viii ff.). Mr. Guenon's book should be widely read as a stimulating introduction to Eastern thought, though not without criticism by those who dis- like to replace one onesidedness by another and who are conscious of a heritage which is more substantial than it is made out to be by some. JOACHIM WACH University of Chicago From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology. Trans- lated by H. H. GERTH and C. WRIGHT MILLS. New York: Oxford University Press, I946. 490 pages. $5.00. The present translation is of essays in the field of science, politics, power, religion, and social structures. These essays supplement the translations previously made. Part I has to do with politics and science as vocations. One might use Weber's analysis of science as a vocation as a model for the analysis of the problems one finds in entering any voca- tion. He outlines the "hazards" of the scientist and also the basic ethics of a profession. Part II is a sociological treatment of power- the structure of power in the "Great Powers" and in the economic foundations of imperialism and the role of the nation in relation to these. Here Weber presents his sociology of charis- matic authority. He points out that the "nat- ural leader" in times of crisis has not been the office-holder but the possessor of special gifts. This leader soon develops a sense of mission and calls upon his followers to sacrifice for the cause. Efforts are made to transfer these charismatic gifts to some of his followers, and so the prac- tice of the consecration of the religious leaders arises. One cannot even catalogue here the outstand- ing propositions of Part III, "The Social Psy- chology of the World Religions." Weber, in treating the relationship of religious to social and economic conditions, does not conceive that the specific nature of a religion "is a simple function of the social situation of the stratum which appears as its characteristic bearer or that it presents the stratum's ideology" (p. 269). He says that "it receives its stamp primar- ily from the religions sources, and, first of all, from the content of its annunciation and its promise." The annunciation and the promise of a reli- gion are the work of its prophets. He says that there are two kinds of prophets: "exemplary" and "emissary." The exemplary prophet points to salvation by exemplary living, while the emissary prophet is an instrument of God who makes ethical demands in the name of God. Men are differently qualified to heed example or hear the voice of God. His essay included in this translation was written to supplement his earlier work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (translated by Parsons). Under the heading "Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions," he describes in negative forms the relationship of religions to the world. Since the world in its various phases is imperfect and cannot offer salvation, religions must reject all the phases of the world. The first opposition is the "natural sib," and so the followers of Jesus needed to be hostile to the members of their households. There is also a sharp tension with the economic and political aspects of life. So also there is tension between "the ethic of religious brotherliness and the spheres of esthetic and erotic life" and with in- tellectual knowledge and culture. In Part IV, Weber treats "Social Structures" dealing with capitalism and rural society in Germany with the Junkers and their relation- ship to the national character of Germany. Fur- ther discussion of social structures is given in the use of caste and social rank in India and the Chinese literati. In these analyses Weber makes use of the ideal typological approach. When the typologi- cal method is used without any statistical or quantitative checkup, numerous errors may enter in. This volume is a small library in itself and contains hypotheses for extended study and re- search in the sociology of religion, in theology, and in the social sciences.
