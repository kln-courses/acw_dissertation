Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2012.  352 pp.  $39.95.  ISBN 978-1-61168-183-3. By the end of the twentieth century, a new generation of leaders had be- gun to assume positions of influence within established organizations.  Born during the last quarter of the twentieth century, these leaders came  of age in a very different America and a different Jewish world than earlier  generations. Not surprisingly, their worldview and understanding of Jew- ish issues set them apart from their elders, as does their approach to orga- nizing. Based upon interviews and survey research, as well as an examina- tion of the websites frequented by younger Jews and personal observation  of their programs, The New Jewish Leaders describes how younger Jews  organize, relate to collective Jewish efforts, and think about current Jew- ish issues. It also offers a glimpse of how they re-envision American Jew- ish communal arrangements.

On Jews and Judaism before and after  the Destruction of the Second Temple, edited by Daniel R. Schwartz and Zeev  Weiss.  Leiden: Brill, 2012.  548 pp.  $226.00.  ISBN 978-90-04-21534-4. The destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE, which put an end  to sacrificial worship in Israel, is usually assumed to constitute a ma- jor caesura in Jewish history. But how important was it? What really  changed due to 70? What, in contrast, was already changing before 70 or  remained basically unchanged despite it? How do the Diaspora, which  was long used to Temple-less Judaism, and early Christianity, which was  born around the same time, fit in? This Scholion Library volume pres- ents twenty papers given at an international conference in Jerusalem in  which scholars assessed the significance of 70 for their respective fields of  specialization, including Jewish liturgy, law, literature, magic, art, institu- tional history, and early Christianity. Art and Music The Art of Time, The Art of Place: Isaac Bashevis Singer and Marc Chagall—A  Dialogue, by Ruth Dorot.  Brighton, UK: Sussex Academic Press, 2011.  120  pp.  $59.95.  ISBN 978-1-84519-409-3. This book draws a comparison between two of the most prominent Jew- ish artists in the twentieth-century: Polish-born magician story-teller  Isaac Bashevis-Singer (1904–1991) and Russian-born creator of visual  magic Marc Chagall (1887–1985). In addition to their East European  Jewish background both were exposed to Western culture. While both  artists were affected by these Western influences, they remained firmly  entrenched within the Jewish culture—the Yiddish language and life in  the “shtetl”—from which they drew their inspiration. Ruth Dorot dem- onstrates that they shared, albeit unwittingly, a common “meta-realistic”  style combining the earthly with the supernatural and the transcendental.  Their works allude to real place names, dates, facts and historical events;  but at the same time contain occult forces, angels, demons, mysticism and  mystery.

The Lady in Gold: The Extraordnary Tale of Gustav Klimt’s Masterpiece, Por- trait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, by Anne-Marie O’Connor.  New York: Alfred A.  Knopf, 2012.  349 pp.  $30.00.  ISBN 978-0-307-26564-7. The story of Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, one of the most  emblematic portraits of its time; of the beautiful, seductive Viennese Jew- ish salon hostess who sat for it; the notorious artist who painted it; the  now vanished turn-of-the-century Vienna that shaped it; and the strange  twisted fate that befell it. A Mahzor from Worms: Art and Religion in a Medieval Jewish Community, by  Katrin Kogman-Appel.  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012.  295 pp.  $49.95.  ISBN 978-0-674-06454-6. The Leipzig Mahzor is one of the most lavish Hebrew illuminated man- uscripts of all time. A prayer book used during Jewish holidays, it was  produced in the Middle Ages for the Jewish community of Worms in  the German Rhineland. Though Worms was a vibrant center of Judaism  in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and drew celebrated rabbis, little  is known about the city’s Jews in the later Middle Ages. Since medieval  mahzorim were used only for special services in the synagogue and “be- longed” to the whole congregation, their visual imagery reflected the local  cultural associations and beliefs. In the pages of Worms’s famous book,  Katrin Kogman-Appel discovers a portal into the life of this fourteenth- century community. Biblical and Rabbinic Literature Between the Lines of the Bible: Exodus. A Study from the New School of Ortho- dox Torah Commentary, by Yitzchak Etshalom.  Jerusalem: Urim Publications,  2012.  220 pp.  $24.00.  ISBN 978-965-524-117-4.   The study of Tanakh has always been a staple of Jewish life. The new  windows which have opened up in the last century into the rooms of  academia—anthropology, archeology, philology, and literary analysis, to  name a few—have given new perspectives to traditional study and have  allowed Orthodox students to understand, with greater depth and in- sight, the stories, laws, prophecies, and poems of this tradition. In this  volume, Rabbi Etshalom demonstrates the methodology through which  traditional study meets academic rigor.

Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2012.  568 pp.  $50.00.  ISBN 978-0- 8028-0388-7. This book presents eighteen commissioned articles on biblical exegesis in  early Judaism, covering the period after the Hebrew Bible was written and  before the beginning of rabbinic Judaism. The essays are arranged in seven  categories: Hebrew Bible, Rewritten Bible, Qumran Literature, Apoca- lyptic Literature and Testaments, Wisdom Literature, Hellenistic Juda- ism, and Biblical Interpretation in Antiquity. Together they provide an  introduction to the diverse modes of scriptural interpretation practiced  by a spectrum of Jewish groups in the Hellenistic and early Roman eras.   Creation, Un-Creation, Re-Creation: A Discursive Commentary on Genesis  1–11, by Joseph Blenkinsopp.  London: T&amp;T Clark, 2011.  214 pp.  $100.00.  ISBN 978-0-567-59101-2. Joseph Blenkinsopp provides a new commentary on Genesis 1–11, the  so-called “Primeval History” in which the account of creation is given.  He works with the conviction that, from a biblical point of view, creation  cannot be restricted to a single event, nor to two versions of an event (as  depicted in Genesis 1–3) but, rather, must take in the whole period of  creation arranged in the sequence: creation—uncreation—recreation (as  can be derived from Genesis 1–11). Blenkinsopp takes into account pre- modern interpretations of the texts, especially in the Jewish interpretative  tradition, as well as modern, historical-critical interpretations, and also  focuses upon the literary and theological artistry of the material at hand. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Bible, by James C. VanderKam.  Grand Rapids:  Eerdmans, 2012.  188 pp.  $25.00.  ISBN 978-0-8028-6679-0. The value of the Dead Sea Scrolls for biblical studies is well known. In  this volume James C. VanderKam offers ways in which the scrolls can  enrich the reading and study of the Bible. Each chapter presents the latest  pivotal developments, focusing on relevant information from the scrolls  and expounding their significance for biblical studies. In the Whirlwind: God and Humanity in Conflict, by Robert A. Burt.  Cam- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012.  382 pp.  $29.95.  ISBN 978-0- 674-06566-6. God deserves obedience simply because he’s God—or does he? Inspired  by a passion for biblical as well as constitutional scholarship, Yale Law  Professor Robert A. Burt conceptualizes the political theory of the He- brew and Christian Bibles. God’s authority as expressed in these accounts  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="5">  Book Notes ♦ 215 is no less inherently problematic and in need of justification than the le- gitimacy of secular government. Taking the Hebrew and Christian Bibles  as a unified whole, Burt traces God’s relationship with humanity as it  evolves from complete harmony at the outset to continual struggle. In al- most every case, God insists on unconditional obedience, while human- ity withholds submission and holds God accountable for his promises.  Contemporary political theory aims for perfect justice. The Bible, Burt  shows, does not make this assumption. Justice in the biblical account is  an imperfect process grounded in human—and divine—limitation. Burt  suggests that we consider the lessons of this tension as we try to negotiate  the power struggles within secular governments, and also the conflicts  roiling our public and private lives. Masking and Unmasking Ourselves: Interpreting Biblical Texts on Clothing and  Identity, by Norman J. Cohen.  Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights, 2012.  193 pp.  $24.99.  ISBN 978-1-58023-461-0. In this look at clothing and identity in the Bible, Norman Cohen presents  ten Bible stories that involve clothing in an essential way, as a means of  learning about the text, its characters, and their interactions. But he also  shows us how these stories help us confront our own life dramas, our own  stories, ourselves. In doing so, he presents the Bible as a mirror, reflecting  back to us our own personalities, ambivalences, struggles and potential  for growth.  Politics in the Bible, by Paul R. Abramson.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction  Publishers, 2012.  215 pp.  $49.95.  ISBN 978-1-4128-4310-2. Politics in the Bible has as its goal to help readers to think critically about  how the Bible illuminates understanding of justice, leadership, and poli- tics. From this viewpoint Paul R. Abramson analyzes stories drawn from  eighteen of the thirty-nine books of the Hebrew Bible and fifteen of the  twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes: A Social-Science Perspective, by Mark R.  Sneed.  Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2012.  341 pp.  $41.95.  ISBN  978-1-58983-610-5. Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ het- erodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s  disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of  modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesias- tes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words  and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew  Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of bib-  Vol. 31, No. 1   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="6"> 216 ♦ Book Notes     lical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive.

Biography, Autobiography, Memoirs, Diaries Holy Beggars: A Journey from Haight Street to Jerusalem, by Aryae Cooper- smith.  El Granada, CA: One World Lights, 2011.  396 pp.  $18.00.  ISBN  978-0-615414-28-7. Aryae Coopersmith, a 22-year old college student in 1960s San Francisco,  meets the charismatic rabbi and folk singer Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and  decides to start a community for him. He rents a house and moves in with  his best friends. Before long they find themselves—and their house—at  the center of the San Francisco spiritual revolution as thousands of young  people—Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Sufis, and followers of countless  gurus—flood in through their doors.  History and Politics City of Rogues and Schnorrers: Russia’s Jews and the Myth of Old Odessa, by Jar- rod Tanny.  Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2011.  265 pp.  $27.95.  ISBN 978-0-253-22328-9. Old Odessa, on the Black Sea, gained notoriety as a legendary city of  Jewish gangsters and swindlers, a frontier boomtown mythologized for  the adventurers, criminals, and merrymakers who flocked there to seek  easy wealth and lead lives of debauchery and excess. Odessa is also famed  for the brand of Jewish humor brought there in the nineteenthth century  from the shtetls of Eastern Europe and that flourished throughout Soviet  times. From a broad historical perspective, Jarrod Tanny examines the  hybrid Judeo-Russian culture that emerged in Odessa in the nineteenth  century and persisted through the Soviet era and beyond. The book  shows how the art of eminent Soviet-era figures such as Isaac Babel, Il’ia  Ilf, Evgenii Petrov, and Leonid Utesov grew out of the Odessa Russian- Jewish culture into which they were born and which shaped their lives. Crime, Jews and News: Vienna 1895–1914, by Daniel M. Vyleta.  New York:  Berghahn Books, 2007.  254 pp.  $90.00.  ISBN 1-84545-181-3. Crimes committed by Jews, especially ritual murders, have long been fa- vorite targets in the antisemitic press.

It challenges received historiographic  assumptions about the centrality of criminal bodies and psyches in late  nineteenth- and early twentieth-century criminology and argues that  contemporary antisemitic narratives constructed Jewish criminality not  as a biologico-racial defect, but rather as a coolly manipulative force that  aimed at the deliberate destruction of the basis of society itself. Through  the lens of criminality this book provides insight into the spread and na- ture of antisemitism in Austria-Hungary around 1900. The book also  provides a re-evaluation of the phenomenon of modern ritual murder tri- als by placing them into the context of wider narratives of Jewish crime. Harvest of a Decade: Disraelia and Other Essays, by Walter Laqueur.  New  Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2012.  255 pp.  $39.95.  ISBN 978- 1-4128-4232-7. This is a selection of essays written during the first decade of the twenty- first century, by a figure widely acknowledged as the conscience of Eu- ropean liberalism. In Walter Laqueur’s lifetime, there have been more  acutely dangerous situations, such as the coming of a world war or the  seemingly unstoppable march to victory of totalitarian regimes, than in  any other previous epoch. Such immediate dangers may not exist at the  present time. But long-term trends are equally or even more threatening,  as we now see in the ability of small groups of people, unprecedented  in history, to inflict enormous damage. This is the underlying essence of  Laqueur’s thinking. The articles and essays selected for this volume deal  with a variety of topics. They do not entirely reflect Laqueur’s interests,  which during this period were more in the cultural field than in politics.  However, politics intrude irrespective of the author’s predilections. La- queur deals with unpleasant truths in concrete geopolitical settings, but  poignantly takes his stand with the men and women who strive to over- come self-censorship in the search for accurate judgment. Jewish Lifeworlds and Jewish Thought: Festschrift presented to Karl E. Grözinger  on the Occasion of his 70th Birthday, edited by Nathanael Riemer.

The Waning of Emancipation: Jewish History, Memory, and the Rise of Fascism  in Germany, France, and Hungary, by Guy Miron. Detroit: Wayne State Uni- versity Press, 2011.  308 pp.  $49.95.  ISBN 978-0-8143-3470-6. With the rise of Fascism in Europe, and particularly the ascent of Ger- many’s Nazi Party, Jews in Germany and eastern and western Europe  were forced to cope with an eroding civil and social status, increasing daily  limitations, and a dark future on the horizon. This reality looked very dif- ferent from the recent past of emancipation, in which Jewish citizens had  enjoyed civic equality and the advance of social integration. In The Wan- ing of Emancipation: Jewish History, Memory, and the Rise of Fascism in  Germany, France, and Hungary, author Guy Miron examines how Jewish  spokespeople from three European communities—Germany, France, and  Hungary—confronted these challenges, and whether they coped by hold- ing onto historical perceptions that materialized during the emancipation  era or by adopting new views. Holocaust Chelmno and the Holocaust: The History of Hitler’s First Death Camp, by Patrick  Montague.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2012.  291 pp.  $75.00.  ISBN 978-0-8078-3527-2. As the first extermination camp established by the Nazi regime and the  prototype of the single-purpose death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor, and  Belzec, the Chelmno death camp stands as a crucial but largely unex- plored element of the Holocaust. Patrick Montague reveals events leading  to the establishment of the camp, how the mobile killing squad employed  the world’s first gas van to terminate the lives of mentally ill patients, and  the assembly-line procedure employed in the camp to commit genocide  on the Jewish population. The Holocaust, Religion, and the Politics of Collective Memory: Beyond Sociology,  by Ronald J. Berger.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2012.  281  pp.  $39.95.  ISBN 978-1-4128-4304-1. Ronald J. Berger in this book fuses history and sociology; he illuminates  the Holocaust as a social construction. Berger’s aim is to counter soci- ologists who argue that the genocide should be maintained as an area of  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="9">  Book Notes ♦ 219 study unto itself, as a topic that should be segregated from conventional  sociology courses and general concerns of sociological inquiry.

Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2011.  227 pp.  $68.00.  ISBN 978-90-420-3421-1. In this book, Camila Loew analyzes four women’s testimonial literary  writings on the Holocaust to examine and question some of the tenets of  the fields of Holocaust studies, gender studies, and testimony. Through  a close reading of the works of Charlotte Delbo, Margarete Buber-Neu- mann, Ruth Klüger, and Marguerite Duras, Loew foregrounds these au- thors’ search for a written form to engage with their experiences of the ex- treme. In the theoretical introduction that unites the four chapters, Loew  eschews essentialism and revises the emergence of the field of Women  and Holocaust studies from the early 1980s on, and signals some of its  shortcomings. In response, and in accordance with a recent turn in vari- ous disciplines of the Humanities, Loew highlights the ethical dimension  of testimony and its responsible commitment to the other. In dealing with  the texts as literary testimonies—a complex genre, between literature and  history—, testimony is freed from the obligation to respond to the re- quirements of factual truth, and becomes a privileged form to voice the  traumatic event, and to symbolically explore the role of excess. The Nazi Séance: The Strange Story of the Jewish Psychic in Hitler’s Circle, by  Arthur J. Magida.  New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011.  269 pp.  $26.00.  ISBN 978-0-230-62053-7. After World War I, fascination with the occult was everywhere as people  struggled to escape the grim reality of their lives. In the early 1930s, the  most famous mentalist in the German capital was Erik Jan Hanussen, a  Jewish mind-reader originally from Vienna who became so popular in  Berlin that he rubbed elbows with high ranking Nazis, became close with  top Storm Troopers, and even advised Hitler. The Nazi Séance is a jour- ney into Germany as it descends into madness—aided by a “clairvoyant”  Jew oblivious to the savagery of men who pursued a Reich they fantasized  would last 1,000 years.

Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012.  405 pp.  $39.95.  ISBN 978-1-4422-1316-6. This book traces the biographies of thirty “typical” perpetrators of the  Holocaust—some well known, some obscure—who survived World War  II. Donald M. McKale reveals that the perpetrators were only rarely, if  ever, tried or punished for their crimes, and nearly all alleged their in- nocence in Germany’s extermination of nearly six million European Jews  during the war. Nearly every fabrication of these war criminals found its  way into the mythology of postwar Holocaust deniers, who have used  them, in one form or another, to buttress the deniers’ biggest lie—that the  Holocaust did not happen. The Quantum Exodus: Jewish Fugitives, the Atomic Bomb, and the Holocaust, by  Gordon Fraser.  New York: Oxford University Press, 2012.  267 pp.  $45.00.  ISBN 978-0-19-959215-9. When the Nazis came into power in 1933, their initial objective was not  to get rid of Jews. Rather, their aim was to refine German culture: Jew- ish professors and teachers at fine universities were sacked. Atomic sci- ence had attracted a lot of Jewish talent, and as Albert Einstein and other  quantum exiles scattered, they realized that they held the key to a weapon  of unimaginable power. Convinced that their gentile counterparts in Ger- many had come to the same conclusion, and having witnessed what the  Nazis were prepared to do, the exiles were afraid. They had to get to the  atomic bomb first. The Nazis meanwhile had acquired a more pressing  objective: their persecution of the Jews had evolved into extermination.  This book compares and contrasts the history of the atomic bomb with  that of the Holocaust. Israel From Palestine to Israel: A Photographic Record of Destruction and State Forma- tion, 1947–1950, by Ariella Azoulay.  London: Pluto Press, 2011.  253 pp.  $29.00.  ISBN 978-0-7453-3169-0. Ariella Azoulay reconstructs the processes by which the Palestinian  majority in Mandatory Palestine became a minority in Israel, while the  Jewish minority established a new political entity in which it became a  majority ruling a minority Palestinian population. By reading over 200  photographs from that period, most of which were previously confined  to Israeli state archives, Azoulay recounts the events and the stories that  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="11">  Book Notes ♦ 221 for years have been ignored or only partially acknowledged in Israel and  the West. Jerusalem: The Biography, by Simon Sebag Montefiore.  New York: Alfred A.  Knopf, 2011.  650 pp.  $35.00.  ISBN 978-0-307-26651-4. Jerusalem is the universal city, the capital of two peoples, the shrine of  three faiths; it is the prize of empires and the battlefield of today’s clash  of civilizations. Drawing on new archives, current scholarship, his own  family papers, and a lifetime’s study, Montefiore sets forth a chronicle of  the city. Jews and Non-Jews Alfred Dreyfus: Man, Milieu, Mentality and Midrash, by Norman Simms.  Bos- ton: Academic Studies Press, 2012.  332 pp.  $55.00.  ISBN 978-1-936235- 39-1. When people say the Dreyfus Affair split a nation or inaugurated a new  era, they are exaggerating and using figurative language. The Affair grew  out of attitudes and opinions that were already in the process of chang- ing by the final decade of the nineteenth century, and these attitudes and  opinions were ingrained in people’s minds and reflected in the perceptions  and feelings of the arts, the sciences, and the philosophies of the period.  In this book, Simms explores many of these changes in the social and  intellectual milieu, as they push and pull, influence and reshape one an- other. This book finds that midrash is a stratagem used by Jews, both con- sciously and not, to survive in a non-Jewish and often anti-Jewish world  and as such can be used to discuss the Dreyfus Affair and the people  involved in it.  From Enemy to Brother: The Revolution in Catholic Teaching on the Jews, 1933– 1965, by John Connelly.  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012.  376 pp.  $35.00.  ISBN 978-0-674-05782-1. In 1965 the Second Vatican Council declared that God loves the Jews.  Before that, the Church had taught for centuries that Jews were cursed  by God and, in the 1940s, mostly kept silent as Jews were slaughtered by  the Nazis. From Enemy to Brother illuminates the baffling silence of the  Catholic Church during the Holocaust, showing how the ancient teach- ing of deicide—according to which the Jews were condemned to suffer  until they turned to Christ—constituted the Church’s only language to  talk about the Jews. As he explores the process of theological change, John  Connelly moves from the speechless Vatican to those Catholics who en-  Vol. 31, No. 1   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="12"> 222 ♦ Book Notes     deavored to find a new language to speak to the Jews on the eve of, and in  the shadow of, the Holocaust. Gentile New York: The Images of Non-Jews among Jewish Immigrants, by Gil  Ribak.  New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2012.  292 pp.  $45.95.  ISBN 978-0-8135-5164-7. Much has been written about immigrant Jews in nineteenth- and twenti- eth-century New York City, but Gil Ribak provides a nuanced picture of  the Americanization process. Gentile New York examines these newcom- ers’ evolving feelings toward non-Jews through four critical decades in the  American Jewish experience. He considers how they perceived Gentiles  in general as well as such different groups as “Yankees” (a common term  for WASPs in many Yiddish sources), Germans, Irish, Italians, Poles, and  African Americans. As they discovered the complexity of America’s racial  relations, the immigrants found themselves at odds with “white” Ameri- can values or behavior and were drawn instead into cooperative relation- ships with other minorities. Ribak’s research relies on memoirs, autobi- ographies, novels, newspapers, and journals culled from both sides of the  Atlantic. Judaism: Jewish Thought and Philosophy The Choice to Be: A Jewish Path to Self and Spirituality, by Jeremy Kagan.  Jeru- salem: Feldheim, 2012.  452 pp.  $24.99.  ISBN 978-1-59826-821-8. Writing for both the serious outsider looking in and for orthodox indi- viduals interested in the basic questions of faith raised by modern experi- ence, Rabbi Jeremy Kagan brings together years of experience in educa- tion with the perspective gained from his transition from a student of  philosophy at Yale University to a student of Torah in Jerusalem. The  result is a formulation of ancient ideas in modern idiom, capable of meet- ing the challenges of our times.

Contemplative Nation challenges the long-standing view that theology  is not a vital part of the Jewish tradition. For political and philosophi- cal reasons, both scholars of Judaism and Jewish thinkers have sought  to minimize the role of theology in Judaism. This book constructs a new  model for understanding Jewish theological language that emphasizes the  central role of theological reflection in Judaism and the close relationship  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="13">  Book Notes ♦ 223 between theological reflection and religious practice in the Jewish tradi- tion. Drawing on diverse philosophical resources, Fisher’s model of Jew- ish theology embraces the multiple forms and functions of Jewish theo- logical language. The Lonely Man of Faith, by Joseph B.

The Lonely Man of Faith is a philosophical essay by one of the twenti- eth century’s greatest Jewish philosophers, Talmudic scholars, and reli- gious leaders, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. In this classic work, Rabbi  Soloveitchik probes the inner experiences of those who seek both re- demptive closeness with God and creative engagement with the world.  He delineates the struggle of people of faith to navigate between seem- ingly contradictory aspects of the human condition: the spiritual and the  material, the religious and the scientific, the covenantal and the majestic.  This newly revised edition includes transliterations and translations of  the Hebrew, fully sourced references, restoration of the original chapter  divisions, and a new introduction by Rabbi Reuven Ziegler.

The Theology of the Chinese Jews, 1000–1850, by Jordan Paper.  Waterloo, On- tario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2012.  157 pp.  $85.00.  ISBN 978-1- 55458-372-0. A thousand years ago, the Chinese government invited merchants from  one of the Chinese port synagogue communities to the capital, Kaifeng.  The Theology of the Chinese Jews traces the history of Jews in China and ex- plores how their theology’s focus on love, rather than on the fear of a non- anthropomorphic God, may speak to contemporary liberal Jews. Equally  relevant to contemporary Jews is that the Chinese Jews remained fully  Jewish while harmonizing with the family-centered religion of China.

Jersey City: KTAV, 2012.  252 pp.  $25.00.  ISBN 978-1-60280-202-5. Gidon Rothstein argues that many communities of Orthodox Jews today  have lost sight of basic, indispensable aspects of what it means to be a  Jew. He shows how a Judaism more focused on the core essentials would  express itself differently from what we see today, in directing us more in- sistently toward a certain type of a God-centered focus, while also laying  out many areas of autonomy and personal choice we similarly neglect. Judaism: Practical Aspects of Living Cremation or Burial? A Jewish View, by Doron Kornbluth  Jerusalem: Mosaica  Press, 2012.  192 pp.  $14.99.  ISBN 978-1-937887-01-8. More and more Jews are choosing cremation rather than burial. Some of  the reasons cited include environmentalism, discomfort with decomposi- tion, and finances. Doron Kornbluth has studied the subject, speaking  with experts, consulting with environmentalists, reading industry reports  and academic studies, and examining both the realities on the ground and  the philosophies behind burial and cremation choices. She analyzes the  reasons people choose cremation, pointing out many myths and miscon- ceptions along the way, and explains why throughout history Judaism and  Jews have insisted on burial. Literary Criticism Modeling Citizenship: Jewish and Asian American Writing, by Cathy J. Schlund- Vials.  Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011.  224 pp.  $24.95.  ISBN  978-1-4399-0318-6. Navigating among historical and literary readings, Cathy Schlund-Vials  examines the analogous yet divergent experiences of Asian Americans  and Jewish Americans. She examines fiction, memoir, and drama to re- flect on how the logic of naturalization has operated at discrete moments  in the twentieth century. Each chapter focuses on two exemplary liter- ary works. For example, Schlund-Vials shows how Mary Antin’s Jewish- themed play The Promised Land is reworked into a more contemporary  Chinese American context in Gish Jen’s Mona in the Promised Land. In  her analysis, Schlund-Vials amplifies the structural, cultural, and histori- cal significance of these works and the themes they address.

Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2011.  304 pp.  $39.95.  ISBN 978-0- 8156-3259-7. John Brinckerhoff Jackson has theorized that quotidian space is shaped  by the everyday culture of its inhabitants. In Place and Ideology in Contem- porary Hebrew Literature, Grumberg sets anchor in this and other con- temporary theories of space and place, then embarks on close readings  of recent Israeli fiction that demonstrate how literature in practice can  complicate those discourses. Grumberg proposes a new understanding  of how Israeli identity is mapped onto the spaces it inhabits, particularly  the concrete sites encountered in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. She  demonstrates that in the writing of many Israeli novelists even mundane  places often have significant ideological implications. Exploring a wide  range of authors, from Amos Oz to Orly Castel-Bloom, Grumberg ar- gues that literary depictions of vernacular spaces play a profound and of- ten unidentified role in serving or resisting ideology. Sephardism: Spanish Jewish History and the Modern Literary Imagination, ed- ited by Yael Halevi-Wise.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2012.  360 pp.  $45.00.  ISBN978-0-8047-7746-9. In this book, Sephardism is defined not as an expression of Sephardic  identity but as a politicized literary metaphor. Since the nineteenth cen- tury, this metaphor has occurred with extraordinary frequency in works  by authors from a variety of ethnicities, religions, and nationalities in Eu- rope, the Americas, North Africa, Israel, and even India. Sephardism asks  why Gentile and Jewish writers and cultural figures have chosen to draw  upon the medieval Sephardic experience to express their concerns about  dissidents and minorities in modern nations. To what extent does their  use of Sephardism overlap with other politicized discourses such as ori- entalism, hispanism, and medievalism, which also emerged from a clash  between authoritarian, progressive, and romantic ideologies? This book  situates Sephardic Studies at a crossroads between Jewish Studies and  Hispanic Studies in ways that enhance our appreciation of how historical  fiction and political history have shaped, and were shaped by, historical  attitudes toward Jews and their representation.

As dictated to his mortal amanuensis, 11-time Emmy Award-winning  comedy writer David Javerbaum, God looks back with unprecedented  candor on his time in the public sector. He takes us behind the scenes of  Genesis, setting the record (un)straight on the real first couple, Adam and  Steve, and challenging long-held notions about the viability of containing  a phylogenetically complete double bestiary within a 450,000-cubic-cubit  watercraft. For the first time, he breaks his silence on Jesus Christ, shed- ding light on a father-son relationship as heartwarming as Will and Jaden  Smith’s. And he reveals his true feelings about his third great faith, Islam,  which, of course, are nothing but positive and respectful. A humorous  look at the three Abrahamic faiths. The Spinoza Problem: A Novel, by Irvin D.Yalom.  New York: Basic Books,  2012.  321 pp.  $25.99.  ISBN 978-0-465-02963-1. Because of his unorthodox religious views, Spinoza was excommunicated  from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656, at the age of twenty- four, and banished from the only world he had ever known. Though his  life was short and he lived without means in great isolation, he nonethe- less produced works that changed the course of history. During the Sec- ond World War, under Nazi Party leader Alfred Rosenberg’s orders, ERR  troops stormed into the Spinoza Museum in Rijnsburg to confiscate Spi- noza’s personal library. This much is true. By imagining the unexpected  intersection of Spinoza’s life with Rosenberg’s, novelist Irvin D. Yalom  explores the mindsets of two men separated by 300 years.

Society and Culture Beautiful Souls: Saying No, Breaking Ranks, and Heeding the Voice of Conscience  in Dark Times, by Eyal Press.  New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2012.  196 pp.  $24.00.  ISBN 978-0-374-14342-8. Fifty years after Hannah Arendt examined the dynamics of conformity  in her seminal account of the Eichmann trial, Beautiful Souls explores the  flipside of the banality of evil, mapping out what impels ordinary people  to defy the sway of authority and convention. Eyal Press shows that the  boldest acts of dissent are often carried out not by radicals seeking to  overthrow the system but by true believers who cling with unusual fierce- ness to their convictions. Drawing on research by moral psychologists and  neuroscientists, Beautiful Souls explores the ways in which people react to  circumstances that test moral limits. Women’s Studies The Status of Women in Jewish Tradition, by Isaac Sassoon.  Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 2011.  200 pp.  $85.00.  ISBN 978-1-107-00174-9. Impelled by the question of whether the inferiority of women is inte- gral to the Torah’s vision, Sassoon sets out to determine where the Bible,  the Talmud, and related literature, especially the Dead Sea Scrolls, sit on  this continuum of patriarchal condescension. Of course, there are mul- tiple voices in both biblical and Talmudic literature, but more surprising  is how divergent these voices are. Some points of view seem intent on the  disenfranchisement and domestication of women, whereas others prove  to be not far short of egalitarian. Opinions that downplay the applicabil- ity of the Biblical commandments to women and that strongly deprecate  Torah study by women emerge from this study as arguably no more than  the views of an especially vocal minority. Zionism British Jewry, Zionism, and the Jewish State, 1936–1956, by Stephan E. C.  Wendehorst.  New York: Oxford University Press, 2011.  422 pp.  $110.00.  ISBN 978-0-19-926530-5. Stephan E. C.

Wendehorst argues  that the ascendancy of Zionism in British Jewry is best understood as  a particularly complex, but not untypical, variant of the 19th and 20th  centuries’ trend to re-imagine communities in a national key. He examines  the relationship between British Jewry and Zionism on three levels: the  transnational Jewish sphere of interaction, the British Jewish community,  and the place of the Jewish community in British state and society. The Crisis of Zionism, by Peter Beinart.  New York: Times Books, 2012.  289  pp.  $26.00.  ISBN 978-0-8050-9412-1. A shift is taking place in Israel and America. In Israel, the occupation of  the West Bank is putting Israeli democracy at risk. In the United States,  the refusal of major Jewish organizations to defend democracy in the  Jewish state is alienating many young liberal Jews from Zionism itself.  Peter Beinart lays out the looming danger to Israeli democracy and the  American Jewish establishment’s refusal to confront it. And he offers a  portrait of the two leaders at the center of the crisis: Barack Obama and  Benjamin Netanyahu. These two men embody fundamentally different  visions not just of American and Israeli national interests but of the mis- sion of the Jewish people itself. Beinart concludes with proposals for how  the relationship between American Jews and Israel must change, and with  an appeal for American Jews to defend the dream of a democratic Jewish  state before it is too late.
