<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gerald Heard's Psychological Approach to the Problem of the Nature of History By William C. Fort, Jr. Associate Professor of Philosophy, Winthrop College Henry fitz gerald heard is in many respects fitted to the task of interpreting the histori cal process. Among his works dealing with the philosophy of history are The Ascent of Humanity, The Social Sub stance of Religion, and The Emer gence of Man. In these he shows an unusually comprehensive grasp of the factual data composing the social process. It is evident that he has made a thorough study of the empirical facts. Although some of his interpre tations are quite forced, others exhibit penetrative insight. He has often made contributions to British philo sophical journals and has recently presented a series of talks over the transmitting station of the British Broadcasting Company. In these he has shown great familiarity with the contemporary scientific theories and discoveries. The British Academy, thinking his contributions were of sub stantial value to the field of philoso phy, presented him with a grant to aid him in carrying on his work. We may begin a consideration of Mr. Heard's view of the nature of the historical process by making note of the distinction he makes between sub jective and objective facts. By the former he means consciousnesses and their contents while the latter expres sion is used to designate specific spatio-temporal events in their his torical succession and simultaneity. It is a mistake to interpret history solely from the standpoint of external cir cumstances. Both subjective and ob jective facts are part of the flowing continuity which is history, and nei ther can be considered apart from the other. However, the emphasis must be placed upon the inner conscious life rather than upon "dead" external ac tualities. To a certain degree, of course, consciousness must adapt it self to its environment but, to a far greater extent, the latter is shaped or molded by the former to fit its inner needs. The material world is pre sented to the mind, not as an impassa ble barrier or as a factor that deter mines mental structure or activity, but as something that is an instrument through which consciousness may ex press or develop itself to its fullest ex tent. However, it is not the development of the consciousness of individual per sons as such that is the sole interest of Mr. Heard. It is rather the gradual evolution or change in social outlook 265</page><page sequence="2">266 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR JULY, 1940 and in social consciousness that he be lieves to be most important. It is true that, in a certain sense, the change takes place in particular minds, but it is largely in the bearing of this altera tion upon the relationship existing be tween the specific person and others that it is of significance to the student of history. The path of the development of con sciousness takes the form of a spiral which gradually expands as it reaches higher and higher stages. Thus its movement is not simply upward in a straight or rectilinear fashion. On the contrary, consciousness evolves as a cyclic process ascending ever higher but swinging to and fro in cycles of ever increasing breadth as it swings around its hypothetical center. From one generation to another man moves from one side of the spiral around to the other. His neAV position is higher than that just left but is the antithesis of the preceding stage. That is to say, a strong mental reaction takes place against the life-view held by the past generation which causes the younger generation to swing to a new interpretation of life that is so different from the old that the latter can no longer be understood. How ever, the process does not stop but moves onward. Still another genera tion makes its appearance and this re volts against the position occupied by its immediate predecessors. It arrives at a point directly above but broader than that held by the grandfathers. While those of the new generation cannot comprehend the life-view of their fathers they can readily inter pret that held by their grandfathers because these stand almost directly "below" them in their psychological development. Again the cycle swings, and so on. In addition to the continuous in crease in breadth of the life-views held by succeeding generations, there are several other items of great im portance to Mr. Heard's philosophy of history. He believes that evolution involves an increasing integration and diversification. As the historical proc ess has developed, men have inte grated their lives by moving from the pursuit of a multiplicity of trifling ends to a smaller and smaller number of increasingly comprehensive goals. At the same time the human spirit strongly desires freedom. The physi cal world offers the chief resistance to man's creative efforts. As a result mankind has, throughout the ages, progressively broken down matter in to ever more minute and fragile par ticles. In place of the few gigantic and ponderous monuments of the past there now stand many delicate and shell-like structures. The latter are more flexible in the hands of the crea tive talent expressed by men and con stitute a distinct advance. As time goes on, the impediment presented by matter will be entirely transcended. Men will not longer consider the ma terial and useful as the greatest aim in life but will follow the immaterial and ideal values present in the his torical sphere. Mr. Heard also presents several other items as included within the significance of the term evolution as revealed in the sphere of human his tory. Consciousness has moved from a form of social unity to one of mul tiplicity. Furthermore, at present there are indications that a higher unity, which will combine the better features of the two preceding stages, is the goal to be attained in the near future. At the same time, mental ener gy has steadily increased in intensity and shows promise to increase still further. With the above observations as a basis Mr. Heard develops his main thesis. He believes that the data we possess concerning the primitives</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM OF NATURE OF HISTORY 267 show that they existed in a state of so cial consciousness different from that which we now know. He calls this the '' co-conscious'' plane. Here the group or tribe was the social or historical unit. Particular members of the tribe were not aware that they were dis tinct entities because all pursued the same ends; namely, those of the group. Telepathic communication served fur ther to bind together the members in to a true historical or social unit. Be cause the goals sought by adherents of the tribe were the same, Mr. Heard concludes that there were not many minds within the community but only one. The group mind, in which all so called particular minds are identified, is all that we find at the "co-con scious" stage. No examples of the pure primitive state of consciousness are now in ex istence. There have been too many alien influences arising from various tribal contacts with individualistic peoples to allow this early mental con dition to persist to the present day. However, the Polynesians are pointed to as an illustration of a partially dis rupted type of the primitive social state. While these people show a con siderable number of traits incompati ble with the "co-conscious" condition, they still have many features in com mon with it. Public difficulties arising in the natural course of social life are never resolved by argument or dis cussion. The tribe simply gets a "feel ing" concerning the proper solution of the problem under consideration. Because the members of this group are still greatly in the "co-conscious" plane, they cannot adapt themselves to the individualistic peoples of today and are rapidly becoming extinct. If a tribal member for any reason becomes separated from his community, he at once feels great mental pain and an guish and is overcome by a great long ing to be reunited with it. During the latter part of the primi tive stage in the history of humanity a serious conflict arose within the minds of the members of the group. This took the form of a division of group loyalty. Men felt identified with the tribe and its interests, yet they also had a strong sense of loyalty to their families. Activities devoted to the well-being of particular families are in many instances incompatible with those directed toward the elevation of the state or group. The lack of har mony between the interests of these two groups thoroughly shattered the unified social life. No longer were the minds of particular men wholly "un conscious" (i.e., unconscious of them selves as autonomous beings). No longer was the only existent con sciousness a tribal consciousness. However, the group did not decom pose suddenly but very gradually. Later a new type of social order slow ly arose from the ashes of the old. Violently torn by mental conflict, the mind of first one member and then of another became divided within it self. In place of a complete lack of self-consciousness (i.e., in place of be ing wholly "unconscious," as Mr. Heard expresses it), each mind be came separated into the conscious and the subconscious as they are now ex perienced. When this occurred the in dividual mind became that of an au tonomous individual. At first he be came dreamily aware that he was no longer at one with the group. He is now interested in pursuing not group goals but only those of a single indi vidual. He grows more and more alarmed at his isolation from the group. He tries to regain his former position in the whole from which he was so violently separated. The group is his deity and he desperately pleads with it in prayer. He also forms re ligious organizations in order to bring back to him that sense of union with</page><page sequence="4">268 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOE JULY, 1940 the whole which he had so recently lost. Ecstacy is also cultivated in an attempt to achieve the same end. After many such unsuccessful en deavors the new individual ceases his strenuous efforts for reunion with the tribe. He realizes that he is no longer part of the common mind. The feeling of being en rapport with his fellows, which was made possible by telepathy, has become sadly lacking because telepathy is practically unknown to day. The former sense of mutual sym pathy has been replaced by one of hostility. The group cannot under stand the queer new individuals. It henceforth tries to eliminate them by such means as torture or murder. On the other hand the individuals realize that they must be crafty to escape the clutches of the tribe. They attempt to hide their new, autonomous nature and pretend to help the group. How ever, they are really using it for the achievement of their own goals. The history of the stage of the in dividual is one of a repeated succes sion of cycles involving four sub stages. The first of these is the age of the "priest-king." Here the newly evolved person utilizes tribal magic in order to "play to" the child-like mind of the group in an attempt to safe guard himself from its wrath and to gain many other ends. In the second stage the "hero" appears. Still trying to protect himself, the individual turns the anger of the tribe from his own being to that of a foreign com munity. The third stage is that of con templation. Here the individual is relatively free from the hostility of the group, which in its turn has be come weaker. He ceases to struggle for material goals and endeavors to gain knowledge which he considers as an intrinsic value. This gradually passes into the stage of the "mystic or monk." In it the individual be comes preoccupied with ultimates ratlier than with everyday affairs. Since the advent of individualism, there has been an ever recurring se ries of these cycles. New individuals appear and are caught up and carried along in the ever repeating process. However, as this movement continues, each cycle occupies less time than did its predecessor. Mr. Heard asserts that this indicates that the human mind is quite evidently showing a marked increase in mental energy. He believes that this growing intensity will continue. During the primitive stage, mankind largely accepted nature as he found her. He was chiefly concerned with survival based upon successfully adapting himself to her rigorous re quirements. Later he began to express himself by hewing huge deposits of stone into large and crude figures. As his energy increased still further his activities manifested themselves by making increasingly intricate and elaborate structures. His work ex panded tremendously in scope and covered many previously unknown fields. At the same time man's activi ties have gradually become more and more integrated. A heterogeneous multiplicity of ends has been slowly replaced by a fewer number of more harmonious and more inclusive goals. There are indications that this proc ess of simplification will continue. Together with the more or less rapid separation of the individuals from their state of identification with the common mind, there is a definite weakening of the group. At all times hostile to the new individuals, it at first attempts to defend itself by means of torturing and murdering these strange beings. Being unsuc cessful in this, the group structure in the form of the state became more and more elaborate and involved. The complicated superstructure is more over becoming devoid of content. Ex</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM OF NATURE OF HISTORY 269 ternal form with little inner meaning and life gradually takes the place of the former significant inner group life. States often crumble only to be reorganized. They weakly carry on to another downfall and then another until finally some minor incident causes them to feebly sink and to ex pire from utter exhaustion. Nothing is left but the individuals who selfishly pursue their own goals with little re gard for others. While Mr. Heard posits it as surely true that during the "co-conscious" state the only consciousness was group consciousness, he insists that during the period of individualism there is no common mind. However, he believes that in the third stage (su perconsciousness), which is yet to come, there will be a synthesis of cer tain historically significant factors contained in the first two. In the first stage ("co-consciousness") there is held to be a broad "field" of con sciousness which nevertheless in cluded little mental energy. The sec ond stage (individualism) was narrow in its scope but very intense in energy. The third stage ("superconscious ness") will be both extensive and in tense. The " superconscious" plane is to be one in which the motives of each particular person again become iden tical with those of others. Further more, Mr. Heard believes that this logical identity of purposes will give rise to a common mind which is to be considered as something existing over and above the sum total of finite hu man minds in relation. Men will no longer seek pragmatic goals but will transcend such considerations. They will henceforth be preoccupied with the pursuit of intrinsic values. Knowl edge as a means to an end will no longer be of social significance. Men will become ambitious to acquire knowledge for its own sake. No long er will the human race work for the subordination of nature for physical comfort and convenience. It will seek only to understand the eternal laws resident within the cosmos. The third stage is considered to be timeless and impersonal. It would be still more accurate to say that the term personality cannot be applied to it. It is an intelligence which is actually op posed to personality. By a growing concurrence of motives, men are now creating the "superconscious," yet it appears, on the other hand, that Mr. Heard believes that it has always ex isted. In fact, particular human minds are merely insignificant particles that are flung off from this greater intelli gence. When Mr. Heard speaks of the com mon consciousness, he is not speaking in monistic terms but as a pluralist. While he does not believe that par ticular persons are to be the historical unit at the third stage of evolution, he insists that here will be many great "fields" of consciousness. In fact, con sciousness in an inevitable accompani ment of any organization existing in the material world. Not only is Mr. Heard a pluralist but he is also a dualist. He freely ad mits the distinction between matter and mind. For him the brain is the in strument of the mind. Historical retrogression arises from a too rapid advancement. Certain in dividuals who have developed beyond others act as leaders for the masses and help to elevate them. If the latter are raised more rapidly than their ca pacity for mental growth will allow, it often happens that they temporarily slip backwards until their normal de velopment takes them forward to and beyond the former level. Progress is an inevitable law of his tory. It may take place at a faster or slower pace and there may be many temporary setbacks due to the cause</page><page sequence="6">270 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOB JULY, 1940 outlined above. The term "progress" as applied to social development des ignates an advance over preexisting conditions toward some ultimate goal of all history. This end appears to be psychological equanimity. Peace will reign in the "superconscious" plane. No longer will mental conflicts be tween opposed desires rock reason to its very foundation. No longer will man be either vaguely or acutely in the self-destroying pain of inner struggles. From the time of his ar rival at the higher plane of conscious ness, he will regard all things in a detached manner. He will lose himself in the engulfing group consciousness and will find eternal repose and yet refreshment in the common spring. Mr. Heard believes that the sense of sight is increasing in its efficiency. For him this fact points to the evolu tion of man to a higher stage. It di rectly reflects the purposive striving of the mind to perceive the universe in its rich detail and in its organic wholeness apart from pragmatic con siderations. There has also been a marked in crease in the energy that man directs toward his work together with a de crease in the "materiality" of that with which he deals. Music requires more energy and yet is less cor poreal than architecture. Further more, mathematics, it seems, is about to supersede music. The former re quires much more mental energy than does the latter and is utterly im material. Mr. Heard posits the view that we are gradually becoming physically smaller. Because of this he believes that men are forced to mutual de pendence and hence to a more social outlook. This points beyond indi vidualism to something higher. Men are no longer satisfied with a mere anthropomorphic attitude to ward the universe. We are now re garding the cosmos more and more from the viewpoint of pantheism. This expansion of outlook beyond the petty standpoint of finite personali ties is a distinct advance and shows a widening of the margin of conscious ness beyond ourselves to one far more embracing. There has also been an expansion in our cosmological outlook. We now realize that the world is far larger than we formerly thought. This has enabled us to transcend our indi vidual or strictly personal interests in a wider whole. The data uncovered in psychical research have also some interesting implications. There has been a strange lack of coherency in "communica tions." Those that have been received have been trite or meaningless. Mr. Heard believes that this shows that there is no continuation of the lives of individuals after this life. At death particular persons seem to be "ab sorbed" into or to become united with the "superconscious." Since this realm of higher consciousness is "im personal" and is incompatible with personality, it cannot express itself intelligibly through the mediums. This explains the disjointed and un intelligible communications generally received. The phenomenon of "multiple per sonality" also shows that all individ uals are "rooted" in avast "undiffer entiated consciousness.'' Particular personalities appearing now and again are merely expressions of that which lies beneath. Furthermore, telepathic communi cation is out of the question so long as one clings to his discrete person ality. It is only when individuality is transcended and the mind is allowed to expand and to sink into unfathomed depths that it is possible to transmit thought without the use of the ordi nary channels.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM OP NATURE OF HISTORY 271 In spite of many valuable aspects involved in Mr. Heard's philosophy of history, there are several features that need serious examination before they are uncritically accepted. Per haps the outstanding one of them is his notion of a group mind conceived as something existing over and above the sum total of individual minds. He appears to believe that a mere con currence of motives is sufficient to give rise to such an entity. On the other hand, he denies the existence of common minds in the age of the indi vidual. Surely, there are organizations today in which the members pursue identical goals. If it is true that we cannot posit the presence of a group mind in certain orders existing today which are marked by the pursuit of the same goals by their components, it is difficult to see how one can postu late the reality of a common mind in the primitive stage. Furthermore, the establishment of the notion of a group mind considered as a being or entity existing over and above the sum of related individuals requires a complete identification of their minds. In order that the mem bers of such a community can be merged into one, there must not only be a logical identity of purposes but also a psychological and metaphysical identity of each mind with every other. While Mr. Heard fulfills the first requirement, he neglects to pro vide for the second and third. He specifies that there is a similarity of ends pursued by the various com ponents of the tribe but fails to realize that in certain respects the psycho logical "make-ups" and functions of the members at any given time were in all probability very different. Furthermore, each mind is meta physically or actually distinct from any other. Unless Mr. Heard can qualify his notion of the common mind in any way other than that it involves a logical identity of purposes, we must hold him to the position that the expression "group mind" is but a word used to describe many psycho logically and metaphysically distinct individuals who pursue identical ends. In this sense there is not a merging of one mind with others so that there is formed one common mind greater than and existing over and above dis crete individuals. What we find is a group of individuals cooperating to ward or attempting the achievement of certain goals. Another difficulty connected with Mr. Heard's view is related with his notion that evolution takes place in the form of a spiral. He believes that, because our position is on the op posite side of the spiral from that of our fathers, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to understand their view. The fact that our interpretation of life is different or possibly incom patible with that of our fathers does not necessarily imply that we cannot comprehend their position. There are many elements and complexes in mod ern thought which we may find op posed to ours. To say that we cannot understand systems of thought op posed to our own is surely not true. The fact that we reject them as in compatible with those values which we hold highest implies an under standing of them. Further, Mr. Heard himself infers that he understands the positions not only of his father but of the whole historical process in ex pounding his theory. Surely he him self is no exception to the rule that any man's position in the historical spiral is on the opposite side from that of his father and his father's grandfather and so on. If Mr. Heard can understand his father's position what can prevent you, me, or anyone from comprehending our father's viewpoint. A further inconsistency in Mr.</page><page sequence="8">272 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOB JULY, 1940 Heard's position lies in his exposition of the "superconscious." It appears that men are now in the process of producing this higher consciousness. The implication is that it has not hitherto existed but is only at present coming into being. On the other hand it seems that the "superconscious" is God and has existed from the begin ning of history. According to this view it is held that we are but dis torted particles "flung off" from this greater mind. It is to Mr. Heard's credit that his approach to the problem of the nature of history is largely empirical. The chief criticism that may be leveled against his presentation is, however, that it is not quite empirical enough. He is correct in his position that in human society, as it exists today, there is no group mind. However, it is certainly an assumption to posit that there has been or will be such a mind or minds. Such a view is in no way established by him. Contrary to his position, it appears that individual personality is gaining more and more recognition as the process of history develops. This is true in spite of occa sional relapses in the form of regi mentation which utterly disregards the rights of individuals in its stress upon an hypothetical whole or abso lute state which is regarded as some thing more important than the par ticular men composing it. In this degenerate form the only purpose of individuals is to serve the state. This is the reverse of the empirical position that the term state (or whole) is merely a name given to describe the sum total of individuals in relation. In this sense the "state" merely exists to serve individuals. We are certainly in no sense empirically aware of a group entity rising above the concurrence of motives of particu lar persons. In positing such a "be ing," Mr. Heard is departing from a strictly empirical approach to the historical process. The interpretation presented by Mr. Heard is, however, distinctly em pirical in his acknowledgement of a multiplicity of minds. He could, of course, have given a more accurate picture of the primitive state had he acknowledged particular minds when and as they are found. However, he is decidedly a pluralist in his inter pretation of the nature of the mental realm in spite of the fact that he is not quite pluralistic enough. Empirical also is the dualistic posi tion taken by him. He acknowledges the reality of a world of nature as something existing independently of or distinct from minds. He makes no attempt to "explain away" the physi cal world or to interpret it in terms of mind. Nor does he believe that the mental is to be explained in terms of the physical universe. It may be wondered what Mr. Heard means to designate by the ex pression "undifferentiated conscious ness." Certainly no consciousness of which we are aware is in any sense undifferentiated. Even in its most passive states there always appears a subject-object relationship. This cer tainly involves differentiation. For the sake of argument it may be admitted that man's energy is increas ing and that his outlook on life is changing. However, neither of these facts points with necessity to the future appearance of a "supercon scious'' sphere in which all indi viduality and personality are elimi nated. A mere broadening of the scope of mental outlook in no sense involves the merging of one mind with another. Mutual sympathy and under standing are admirable attributes but both of these terms imply an object (i.e., other minds) which is distinct from the person who sympathizes or understands.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM OP NATURE OF HISTORY 273 Nor does the fact that men are turn ing more and more to "less material" forms of expression indicate the de velopment to a common consciousness. It is difficult to see any correlation between a group mind and the notion of degrees of materiality. It may be that men have more fully "worked" the field of weightier materials and in so doing have gradually acquired the ability to handle more difficult and more fragile matter. This is evidence of an increased richness of the socio cultural life of individual persons and in no sense implies a group mind. The notion that men are becoming smaller in physical stature and must therefore depend upon one another to a greater extent than previously is incompatible with an important aspect of Mr. Heard's theory. He gives this as one of the outstanding evidences of the advance to a new state where pragmatic goals will be cast aside in favor of intrinsic ends. In the light of this argument, it would seem that if men are decreasing in size it is becom ing pragmatically imperative that they depend upon one another for mutual aid. It would thus seem that the pragmatic aspect of their strug gles is increased rather than dimin ished. The fact that the data presented in psychical research are insignificant or incoherent need by no means be inter preted as indicating the existence of a "superconsciousness" behind such phenomena. It would be more plaus ible to say that such results point to nothing at all beyond the external expression of such thoughts as ordi narily exist on the margin of con sciousness of the medium. One of the most valuable features of Mr. Heard's philosophy lies in his recognition that the historical process involves an increase in differentiation and integration. It certainly does seem that such a tendency is the dominant one in the stream of history. From the amoeba to man and from primitive man to civilized human be ings this tendency has persisted. It first appeared in the differentiation of the simpler organisms to form the more complex but more integrated beings. Later it has become manifest by the increased differentiation or enrichment of the socio-cultural life of man together with a decided inte gration in the same field. While we can agree with Mr. Heard in his polemic against egoistic indi vidualism, it must be insisted that by no means all individualism is of this nature. Cooperation, whether it be of a lower or a higher order, is a prime requisite of any social organization. In fact, it may be said that without some form of cooperation no social order can exist. There are those who speak of collectivistic societies as though only these possess cooperation among the members who compose them. The inference is that these types of organizations, because highly centralized, can enforce mutual co operation by means of many stringent laws upheld by coercive methods. They assume that unless cooperation is enforced it cannot exist. In reply to this, it must be insisted that this form of cooperation is of a lower rather than of a higher type. Whatever the ends to be accomplished may be, the fact remains that the method of coercion can attain at most only a somewhat half-hearted and external cooperation and not a full cooperation into which a person enthusiastically enters. The human mind simply can not endure for long a sense that it is being externally compelled. My small daughter does not mind my holding her arms to her side until she becomes aware that I am restricting her free dom of movement. She then becomes furious and struggles until she is re leased. This tendency in her is not an</page><page sequence="10">274 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOB JULY, 1940 exceptional one but on the contrary conforms to that which is trne of practically all normal and even many abnormal individuals. If this is the case, it would seem that the highest social ends are not to be attained by any attempt to tran scend individualism. (Individualism is by no means confined to a capitalistic society.) A society which recognizes the inherent worth of every person and which gives great scope for indi vidual freedom is the only form which can attain extreme heights. However, here one must guard against an archism in which everyone does just as he pleases with little or no regard for others. This can be done by means of correct educational and social leadership. In this way free individ uals can be led to desire to cooperate with others for the greatest good of each and every individual. Here there would be little or no external com pulsion demanding that the particular person regard himself as essentially of small worth (or even worthless) and that he subordinate himself to that which is supposed to be greater than he (i.e., the whole or state re garded as an entity or being existing over and above individuals). This would avoid the sense of repression resulting from such a condition to gether with its attendant evils. Among those evils is the dissipation of much mental energy which could profitably be used as a socially constructive force. Another is the sense of antago nism, which almost inevitably arises, toward the constraining influence. Sooner or later this antagonism be comes so great that it breaks through the bonds of reason and expresses it self in violence or revolution. For this reason alone, such a social order will sooner or later break down. Permanent social progress cannot come through a highly centralized collectivistic system in which the worth of individuals is minimized while that of the state is deified. Neither can it arise from its extreme opposite or anarchism in which noth ing is actively done to nurse mutual cooperation. It must be accomplished by means of an individualistic social order in which particular persons are not coerced but are led to appreciate and to follow socio-cultural values. While it is true that this method is necessarily a slow one, I firmly be lieve that it is the only one that will eventually lead to lasting constructive results. It may be added that Mr. Heard explicitly acknowledges the basis for the above conclusion in his statement to the effect that human beings strongly desire freedom. It can be admitted that individuals in a group possessing a common pur pose act differently from the way in which they would act if alone. How ever, this fact may readily be ex plained by mutual suggestion without the necessity of bringing in the no tion of a group consciousness. Whether or not telepathic commu nication is a fact is far too debatable for Mr. Heard to gain much weight in his argument from it. In summary, it may be said that, although it is regrettable that the author discussed lapses into a belief in a group mind, his view is neverthe less largely sound in his empirical approach to the problem of the nature of the historical process.</page></plain_text>
