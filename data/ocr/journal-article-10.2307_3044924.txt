<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Books I. British Literature More than a century and a half after his death, Coleridge continues to serve as a kind of academic blaue Blume luring scholars and critics end- lessly onward. This is no doubt a tribute to the allusiveness as well as the elusiveness of his incomparably fecund and richly stocked mind and to the supremely connotative power of his language and thought. No won- der that he generates book after book. To hand are six such that have appeared in the past year and a half. The most scholarly and academically satisfying of the current harvest of Coleridge studies is JAMES C. McKUSICK'S Coleridge's Philosophy of Language (Yale Studies in English, no. 195; New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986; pp. xiv + 175; $15.95 paper). McKusick is concerned to situate Coleridge's philosophy of language in its own time and in relation to antecedent theories, especially those from the eighteenth century. At the same time he has things to say about the relation of Coleridge's phi- losophy of language to twentieth-century critics and theories. McKusick argues that Coleridge's developed views of language constitute "a coher- ent body of thought underlying his poetry, criticism, and aesthetics." McKusick describes Coleridge's early ideas on language as dominated by the concept of the linguistic sign. He notes the impact on Coleridge's thinking of Berkeley's philosophy and of the materialist and reductionist ideas on language of that pioneer etymologist John Horne Tooke. But he notes that by the end of the eighteenth century, partly because of his study at Gottingen, Coleridge broadened and deepened his theory of language and moved beyond the simplicities of eighteenth-century lin- guistic thought. McKusick considers Coleridge's practical criticism in the light of his enriched ideas on language and then comes to rest with an examination of Coleridge's Logic. For students of Coleridge the chapter on the Logic (a work written between 1819 and 1828) will prove to be the most valuable contribution of this study, since the Logic did not become generally available until its first full publication in 1981 in an edition by J. R. de J. Jackson for the Princeton Coleridge. McKusick sees the Logic as an attempt to answer and transform Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and as the maturest fruit of Coleridge's thought applied to language. McKusick writes that "Coleridge regards the creation of grammatical discourse out of lexical chaos as the first distinctively human act. He sees grammar, and not the mere fact of signification, as the most distinctive feature of human language." Cole- 127</page><page sequence="2">128 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE ridge's philosophy of language, argues McKusick, is a "means of release from the tyranny of Hartleyan associationism, the intellectual arrogance of Horne Tooke's linguistic materialism, the stifling narrowness of the Deists' mechanical universe, and the sheer randomness of Locke's arbi- trary signs." Further, "Coleridge regards language as a testing-ground for ultimate questions concerning man's moral and political destiny." In short, language is the key to all Coleridgean mythologies, a large claim but not in this case a misplaced one. That Coleridge is deeply committed to questions of the nature of the human and of man's moral and political destiny is the central contention of ANYA TAYLOR'S Coleridge's Defense of the Human (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1986; pp. xii + 223; $20). Rather than seeing Coleridge primarily as a poet or literary critic or theorist, Taylor finds the essential Coleridge to reside in his concern for human integrity, for "humanness," a word Coleridge himself coined. While this approach may not give us all the Coleridge there is, it does focus on Coleridge the philosopher in a way that contains a large measure of Coleridge the writer. Taylor argues that Coleridge was among the first to confront and think through the implications of ideas that have since gained even wider currency in modern thought, ideas that emphasize the animal or me- chanical or statistical character of the human being at the expense of the spiritual. Coleridge was strongly opposed to such notions, and Taylor sees most of Coleridge's career as an expression of opposition to anti- humanistic trends of his time. Thus her book is organized, not around the stages in Coleridge's life as a writer, but around certain key ideas and concerns that he dealt with in his writings. As Taylor puts it, "if we look at his actual output, . . . we see a man who may occasionally write poems but whose major concerns are political, social, and religious." While Taylor's approach will not dispose of the interest in Coleridge the writer-nor is it intended to, one assumes-it does remind us yet again that for Coleridge any unity of work must be sought in his ideas and that these ideas finally reside in a metaphysical position that is also unabashedly religious. Thus even a topic like his thought on language is here seen as an aspect of Coleridge's defense of the uniquely human; and from such an emphasis we can better appreciate the implications of such a characteristically Coleridgean turn of expression as that which calls language the "offspring and Epiphany of the human Soul." Who else but Coleridge can so economically and yet allusively link language, the soul, and the infinite in a single utterance?</page><page sequence="3">RECENT BOOKS 129 Wherever we touch Coleridge he seems to reach out and pull us into the fulness of his philosophy. If this is so for language and for humanness, it is no surprise that it is equally so for Coleridge on nature. In RAI- MONDA MODIANO'S Coleridge and the Concept of Nature (Tallahassee: Florida State University Press, 1985; pp. xiv + 270; $25) we find again the larger philosophical issues in Coleridge subsuming the smaller, ini- tially more obvious issues. In this study Modiano sets out to affirm that, contrary to much received wisdom, nature was not marginal for Cole- ridge or necessarily of lesser importance than for other romantics. To that end she traces Coleridge on nature throughout his career, not omit- ting relevant biographical aspects, especially the relationship with the Wordsworth circle. All of this leads her to an assessment of how Coleridge sought to harmonize his ideas on nature with Christian theology, and we are back with the Coleridge of ultimate questions. Of particular interest in Modiano's study is her treatment of the Ger- man Naturphilosophie that Coleridge absorbed, appropriated, and also transformed. Modiano is a co-editor of several volumes of Coleridge's Marginalia, and she uses this material in assessing Coleridge's debt to Kant, Schelling, and Steffens. Once again, however, we find the unity lies not so much in a particular work as in the general position that can be extrapolated from various works: "[Coleridge's] writings on natural phi- losophy reveal the essential features of a coherent and integrated system that is thoroughly structured and even conceptually rigid, notwithstand- ing the fact that it is dispersed in bits and pieces throughout Coleridge's work." Coleridge, it increasingly appears, must be taken whole to be properly responded to. For all of his inwardness, self-examination, and self-reflection, Coleridge is also notable for his literary relations with others and for one in par- ticular, the relation with Wordsworth. It is therefore not surprising that among the current harvest of Coleridge studies two books should be de- voted specifically to the Coleridge-Wordsworth connection. They are: MARTIN GREENBERG, The Hamlet Vocation of Coleridge and Words- worth (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1986; pp. xiv + 209; $22.50), and Lucy NEWLYN, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the Language of Al- lusion (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986; Oxford English Monographs; pp. xviii + 214; $37). Greenberg's monograph consists of two substantial essays, one each on Coleridge and Wordsworth. Both essays are directed toward working out what Greenberg calls the "Hamlet vocation" of each poet. By this he means not so much their thoughts on Hamlet as character or literary work, though these are part of the picture, especially as regards Cole-</page><page sequence="4">130 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE ridge, but rather their response to finding themselves to be Hamlet-like in character, that is, reflective minds divorced from effective action. Nei- ther one, in Greenberg's view, quite overcame the burden of the "Hamlet vocation," Coleridge living a "death in life," and Wordsworth dying "from the feet up"; but both, according to the author, offer paradigms of the response to a vocation that is uniquely modern. Newlyn's concern in her study of the Coleridge-Wordsworth relation is more specifically biographical, chronological, and explicative. She fo- cuses on the years 1797-1807 when the association between the two was most intense. She argues that both authors, as well as the commentators who followed, tended to picture as compatibility what was in fact very real difference, but that it was the difference that made all the difference in their work and that stimulated both writers' creative powers. Her study concentrates on what she sees as a kind of private language in the poetry of the two authors during the crucial years of their association. As she puts it, they were not only "men speaking to men," but "poets speaking to poets." This study is certainly that of a scholar speaking to scholars, and some may take issue with particulars here and there; but that is of the nature of the subject, which after all is allusion, and mainly private and fragmented allusion at that. Overall, Newlyn has cast light on an aspect of early Wordsworth and Coleridge that will deepen our under- standing of them as men and poets. If in Coleridge himself we must seek for the unity in the multeity of his writings and fragments, it is perhaps appropriate that in DAVID JASPER, ed., The Interpretation of Belief: Coleridge, Schleiermacher, and Roman- ticism (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1986; pp. xii + 237; $25) we find not a sustained study by a single hand but a collection of fourteen essays, only about half of which are specifically on Coleridge and/or Schleier- macher, the remainder being about Romantics and Victorians from Wordsworth to Hardy. This collection publishes papers from a 1984 con- ference at Durham that marked the 150th anniversary of the deaths of Coleridge and Schleiermacher. Like all such collections the contents are varied, but like all works on Coleridge certain Coleridgean themes sur- face again and again. We find a paper on Coleridge's theory of the imagination as a He- gelian solution to Kant (Kathleen Wheeler), an essay-making very ef- fective use of biography-on Coleridge's religious thought (John Beer), a suggestive treatment of Coleridge on unity of thought (James S. Cut- singer), and a fine piece by Stephen Prickett, "On Reading Nature as a Romantic," that encapsulates Coleridge on both language and nature. And these are but the Coleridge papers. There are also essays on Words-</page><page sequence="5">RECENT BOOKS 131 worth (by Michael Edwards, and J. R. Watson), on Tennyson and New- man (Michael Wheeler), and Hardy (Ian Gregor), as well as the Schleier- macher contributions. The concluding paper, however, by Kevin Lewis, titled "The Impasse of Coleridge and the Way of Blake," cannot serve as a fitting conclusion to this present discussion, for Lewis argues that Cole- ridge is of no use to us now in religious matters, that Coleridge is among the Ancients whereas Blake stands among the Moderns. The abundance of studies on Coleridge, each in its way deeply appreciative of and sym- pathetic to Coleridge's thought, would seem to argue otherwise. Perhaps Lewis does not appreciate that among Coleridge's other Romantic qual- ities he also exhibits that of eternally becoming, never being, Werden rather than Sein. Such a thinker does not cease to be relevant but like die blaue Blume beckons us ever onward. G. B. TENNYSON II. Books Briefly Noted A D A M S, H E N R Yx. Sketches for the "North American Review".
