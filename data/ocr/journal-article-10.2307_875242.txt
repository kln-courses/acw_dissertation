<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GILT-BRONZE CLOCKS OF CHARLES CRESSENT case of the clock itself must have looked like. If it is by Cressent, the free form of the modelling would suggest that it probably dates from rather late in his career. Two clocks which Mine Ballot attributes to Cressent should also be men- tioned. The first (Fig.4o) appeared in the sale of Baron Achille Seilliere at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris, Ioth May 189o, lot 503 repr. Mme Ballot mistakenly links this clock with the description of the cartel clock Type B illustrated by Fig.36. Although certain of its figurative elements correspond to the sale catalogue descriptions, the organization as a whole is totally alien to Cressent's style. The other clock is the very fine cartel clock (Fig.42) which belongs to the Banque de France. Although this clock makes use of the recoiling lion, a theme favoured by Cressent, the organization and extremely adroit handling of the intricately abstract mass of 'S' and 'C' scrolls is in a too highly advanced rococo style to be his. Last of all there is a gilt-bronze bracket clock (Fig.4x), the case of which appears to be the prototype of Type A. However, the works in the three known examples strongly suggest that they were all made before Cressent had even left Amiens. He almost certainly had these clocks in mind when he designed the case of Type A, for their basic outlines are almost identical. A. SOME MORE GAUGUIN CERAMICS JUDGING from the numbers scratched into some of Gauguin's ceramics - the highest known of them being 8o, found on a piece that dates from the winter of 1886-7 - he must have executed a total of at least ninety. Of these, fifty-three have hitherto been traced to museums and private collections, while six (or possibly seven), known from photographs and catalogues only, should also be included in his euvre. This means that Gauguin must have made at least thirty pieces more than are known today. We are familiar with the shape of some of these from Gauguin's paintings and sketches, and we know of a few other pieces, described by Feneon or mentioned in cata- logues, that have not been identified. As some of the early pieces seem to have been of poor quality, they have no doubt in some cases been thrown away when the heads or handles broke. Yet, with so great a number missing, there was a good chance of unknown pieces turning up now that an interest in this field of Gauguin's work has been aroused.' The following deals with six pieces, which all came from Lucien Vollard's Collection. Three of these are today in a private collection in France,2 while the three others, which are known to me from photographs only, belong to the Musie Leon-Dierx in St Denis in the island of Reunion.3 The authenticity of all the six pieces is beyond doubt, and they can without difficulty be assigned their place in Gau- guin's total ceramic euvre, which on the basis of technical and artistic criteria can be divided into the following periods: I. The winter of 1886-7 (Paris, after the first summer in Brittany). II. The winter of 1887-8 (Paris, after Central America and Martinique). III. 1889 (Paris in January-March and in May); and I890 (Paris in February-March). IV. 1893-5 (France, between the two sojourns in Tahiti). The rediscovered pieces dealt with here belong under I, II, and IV. I. The winter of 1886-7. The first pieces to be dealt with here (Figs. 43, 45, 47) belong to the earliest group, from the winter of 1886-7. A few of Gauguin's ceramics from this period are clearly seen to have been executed in close collaboration with the ceramist Ernest Chaplet. Both as regards shape and glazing they show the influence of the ordinary workshop technique, e.g. a number of pots thrown on the wheel4 as well as a pair of fairly big rectangular jardinidres.5 One of these may be regarded as the very starting-point of Gauguin and Chaplet's collaboration, for here Gauguin is using the motif of a naked girl taken from the wooden relief he had exhibited at the Impressionist Exhibition in 1886, and which is known to have aroused Chaplet's interest in his art (Fig. 46).6 Gauguin does not, however, seem to have been satisfied with these pieces. He wanted to avoid the stamp of the mould, or what he called the 'mechanical' throwing on the wheel, and instead to endow his pottery with 'la vie d'une figure'. He therefore began to model his ceramics freely like primitive pottery, and for material he resorted to Chaplet's early stoneware, which had a more rustic and primitive character. It is hard fired stoneware, which in most cases is 1 MERETE BODELSEN: Gauguin Ceramics in Danish Collections, Copenhagen [g96o]; CHRISTOPHER GRAY: Sculptures and Ceramics by Paul Gauguin, Baltimore [1963]; MERETE BODELsEN: Gauguin's Ceramics. A Study in the Development of his Art, London [1964]. a My thanks are due to Dr John Rewald for calling my attention to this private collection and also for permitting me to quote from Gauguin's unpublished letters to Pissarro (cf. notes 6 and 27). 3 For giving me photographs of the three R6union ceramics and for permitting me to publish them here, I am most grateful to Dr Richard S. Field, whose extensive and profound Gauguin studies have led him to trace this gift of Lucien Vollard's to the Ile de la R6union. Besides the three ceramics the gift includes a monotype of Gauguin's The Call (45 by 28 cm.) (cf. REWALD: Gauguin Drawings, New York and London [1958], 113 and 114). Lucien Vollard's gift was exhibited in I947 at the Musie de la France Outre-Mer (now the Mus6e des Arts Africains et Oc6aniens) in Paris (cf. Catalogue [April 1947], Nos. i-4). 4 M.B., 1964, Figs.9 (colour), I8, 19, 21 (colour), 42a and 42c. 5 M.B., 1964, Figs.2o (colour) and 41. 6 From one of Gauguin's letters to Pissarro we know that the latter thought very highly of this relief, when Gauguin in the autumn of 1882 sent it to him as a gift ('Je suis tout confus et rouge en lisant vos compliments a propos du bois que je vous ai envoyd.. .') As it belonged to Pissarro it had been deposited after the closing of the Impressionist Exhibition on I5th June 1886 in Signac's studio together with Pissarro's own paintings. That Gauguin already on I8th June went to Signac's studio in order to make a drawing of the relief with a view to his collaboration with Chaplet, appears from the painful episode that Seurat refers to in his letter to Signac of 19th June 1886 (see DORRA-REWALD: Seurat, Paris [i959], p.xlixf.)</page><page sequence="2">4-1 -q 0 Q0 co= 0A -o C;o -D O 8' S Co) 4- cnc Cl) 4d 4-j~ c, OC) 0 a;C u ?c bo o 0 S C) d-o u 4Z 5.)

The decoration is modelled in relief, or scratched into the clay, and painted with a white, a blue or a green slip, or covered with a yellow glaze. After the firing some of the details have sometimes furthermore been painted in gold. Gauguin's motifs are mostly taken from Brittany: Breton girls and herdboys wearing local costumes and surrounded by cows and sheep, as we find them in his sketch-book from the summer of 1886. Sometimes they are even grouped in the same manner as in his paintings from that period. The pot from Reunion, seen in Fig. 43, is an example of this early Brittany style. It is executed in an unglazed brown stoneware clay and on the shoulder of the vase, between the three funnel-like apertures, are modelled in relief the reclin- ing figures of a Breton boy, a Breton girl, and a sheep, while on the lid two more sheep are to be seen, whose characteristic profiles are already known to us from another vase of the same period (M.B. 1964, Fig. 42a). The rediscovered ceramic from a French private collec- tion, shown as Fig. 45, is interesting in that it can be regarded as Gauguin's deliberate counterpart to Chaplet's above- mentioned jardiniere (Fig.47). As can be seen, Gauguin has retained the rectangular shape of the vessel, and the land- scape and the house that serve as a background are the same as in both the wooden relief (Fig. 46) and thejardinidre (Fig. 47). But this little vessel Gauguin has managed to 'bring to life' by the free modelling, the trees thrusting their roots under the vessel and lifting their green tops above the rim. The whole motif - almost suggestive of a child's toy - has the innocent charm of the early Brittany style: the girl stands holding her stick, surrounded by sheep, every one of which can be recognized from Gauguin's sketches and paintings. They are modelled in low relief and painted with a dark brown iron-colour. The girl's jacket is painted with blue slip; her headdress is white, and the grass and the trees are in varying shades of green. The inside of the vessel is covered with a thin yellowish glaze (see also Fig.49). Of the thirty ceramics that can be referred to group I, only eight have visible numbers scratched into the body, viz. Nos.I9, 20, 47, 49, 50, 52, 54, and 55. It is therefore gratifying to be able to add another number to the series: on the end of the little jardiniere one finds the signature P Go together with the figure 53 in Gauguin's own hand (Fig.44). II. The winter of 1887-8. No.56, the first piece that Gauguin executed on his return from Martinique, shows a marked change in his style in the direction of exoticism. The piece belongs in a small group of ceramics, executed in Chaplet's reddish-brown unglazed stoneware. They are a kind of portrait vases, where por- trait and vessel are merged in a way suggestive ofpre-Colum- bian pottery. The group comprises the portrait of Mme Schuffenecker with a snake belt, marked as number 56 (M.B., I964, Fig.43 in colour), Schuffenecker's little daughter, inscribed 'd mon ami Schuff' (M.B., 1964, Fig.46 in colour), the portrait head of a Martinique woman with a checkered kerchief, marked as number 64 (M.B., 1964, Fig.55 in colour), and the Leda vase (M.B., I964, Figs.5o and 51, both in colour). It is in this group that the portrait head from R~union of a girl, which we may here call Lafemme au capuchon, belongs (Fig.48). This is obvious from the material, the unglazed, coarsely grained clay with only the eyes and hair painted with a blackish iron colour, as well as from the whole character of the sculpture, where the girl's head - like that of the Martinique woman marked 64 - is hollowed out at the top of the headdress so as to form a vase. The number on the Reunion girl, half-hidden in front under the buttoned capuchon, should possibly be read as 65.7 Her sensitively modelled, slightly inclined head with the pensive, melancholy expression, is strikingly contrasted with the robustness of the hood, which casts deep and softening shadows around the head and at the same time gathers the sculpture firmly together with a strong monumental effect. Through this monumentality the portrait has a certain affinity with Gauguin's drawing of a Breton girl, which can be dated 1889 (Fogg Art Museum, see M.B., 1964, p.I88, Fig.138). But in 1889 the monumentality has become slightly forced and the outlines deliberately simplified. The Femme au capuchon shows both the close observation of the physiognomy and a striving after a unity of form that is characteristic of Gauguin's post-Martinique portraits. It thus stylistically finds its place between the more improvised modelling style of the early Breton ceramics from the winter of 1886-7 and the purely sculptural ceramics of 1889 with their splendid glazes and strange symbolistic overtones.8 Besides the group of portrait-vases a group of smaller pots, decorated with freely modelled figures, can be assigned to the post-Martinique period. It is characteristic of these that their form is no longer spontaneous as in the early Breton pots, but gives the impression of having been disciplined under the influence of Japanese ceramics and Chinese bronzes. Some of these pieces are coated with a dark brown or greyish glaze, while in others the glaze varies in shades from bright-red through brownish-red to ochre or yellow. That Gauguin closely scrutinized this richly varied range of colours can be seen from the fact that after the firing he picked out the lines where the colours change in gold, thus achieving an effect of cloisonnism. A few Breton motifs have been taken up again, and treated in this new glazing style. The pot reproduced as Fig.5o from a private collection in France is an example of this. It is crowned by a girl's head, seen against a small Breton cross - probably the first cross to appear in Gauguin's art. The form of the pot recalls an unglazed jar with a C6zanne motif scratched on its side (M.B., 1964, Fig.i I). But the present pot definitely belongs in group II, by its motley dark-brown glaze mingled with whitish and bright red, in which the contours and some small iron spots have been carefully picked out in gold. The little girl, whose features have unfortunately been somewhat blurred by the glaze, also belongs in group II, for on closer inspection she turns out to be Schuffenecker's little daughter, whose child- like features we recognize from Gauguin's above-mentioned portrait vase modelled in unglazed clay (Fig.5I). 7 As the number (and possibly also a signature) is half-hidden by the capuchon, it seems as if after having signed the bust Gauguin added the capuchon as an afterthought. 8 In my book (1964) I have shown the symbolic content and ambivalent mean- ings of many of Gauguin's ceramics. The most important of the 1889 sculptures is the Copenhagen self-portrait (Figs.8o-i in colour), in which Gauguin has depicted himself with closed eyes (as a reference to his new symbolist pro- gramme) and without ears (as a reference to the tragedy in Arles).</page><page sequence="4">48.

The bathing girl motif now appears in two variants: both on a bowl as a Bretonne, freely modelled and painted in white slip under- neath a clear glaze (M.B., I964, Figs.65 and 66, both in colour), and on a firmly composed vase as an exotic girl, modelled in relief in a dark unglazed clay, with streaks of gold in her flowing hair (M.B., I964, Fig.58, colour). It is alongside this exotic bathing girl (Fig.52) that the third of the ceramics from a private collection in France finds its place (Fig.53). It is a gourd-like vase, furnished on one side with an angular handle, whose form suggests metal. Opposite this Gauguin has modelled two butterflies (seen in Fig.53. in profile), placed symmetrically on the side of the bowl. The vessel is coated with a glossy, dark-brownish glaze, while the voluptuous figure of the exotic girl with her long hair and golden bracelets, perched at the lip of the vase, is modelled freely in a dark-brown clay, which has remained unglazed in the firing. Like the Biraboudour-inspired girl in another of Gauguin's vases from this period (M.B., I964, Fig.62), she is holding a drapery, and to the right of her is seen something that more than anything looks like a bowl of fruit (apples?) and a small snake (Fig.54). If so, this is probably the first snake to appear in Gauguin's art. IV. France 1893-5- The last of the ceramics to be dealt with here, the mask of a native from the Reunion museum (Fig.56), is of very great interest, because this must be la tite sauvage emaillie (Masque)' that Gauguin in a letter of December 1896 asks Monfreid to send to him to Tahiti: 'C'est une pidce de ceramique unique', he writes, 'et j'en jouirai Inormement, d'autant plus que j'ai amateur ici.'9 It cannot, however, have been sent to Tahiti, for in April I897, when Vollard asks Gauguin for models for bronze casts, the latter suggests that he should buy his statue of Oviri (Fig.89) and this tWte de sauvage, as they would both make beautiful bronzes. It would not be ex- pensive either, and one could e.g. make thirty copies of the mask and sell them at ioo francs apiece.10 He also tells Monfreid: 'De Vollardje regois une lettre qui voudrait beaucoup de choses, des dessins, des moddles de sculpture pour Itre tirns en bronze. Je lui reponds d ce sujet un peu ironiquement, lui disant que tout cela existe depuis longtemps et sans profit pour moi. Je lui dis aussi qu'en achetant la statue et le masque ciramiques, qu'un tirage en bronze serait pour un homme habile comme lui d'un grand rapport... '11 That Vollard did actually take the cue from Gauguin's letter as regards making casts in bronze of this mask can be seen from the fact that today no less than three bronze copies are known, one of which was given to the Musfe des Arts Africains et Oc~aniens in I943 by Lucien Vollard, while two others are in private collections in the U.S.A. (Gray, 1963, No.I io). As to the dating of the mask, Dr Rewald, when publishing one of the bronze copies in I959, drew attention to its similarity to the -head of the 'Earth', Tefatou, in Gauguin's painting Hina and Tefatou from 1893 (Museum of Modern Art, New York) and therefore dated it, Tahiti 189I-3.12 Seeing that the rediscovered original from which the bronzes have been cast is a ceramic, it is, however, more likely that it was executed in Paris after Gauguin's return to France. This refers it to the period during which the statue of Oviri is known to have been executed in Chaplet's workshop in the usual hard fired stoneware clay (M.B., 1964, Fig.99 in colour). As the Musee Leon-Dierx in Reunion does not describe the material of the mask as gres (hard fired stoneware clay) - the term it uses about the two other ceramics - but as 'Terre cuite. Chamotte d gros grains, 6maillage lIger, face brune, cheveux et moustache bleus', the body may possibly be something like the lightly fired clay seen in another ceramic from this period, viz. the Tahiti vase in the Copenhagen Museum of Decorative Art (M.B., I960, No.i i). In this vase the body is of a light porous clay, while the figures cut in relief on its sides are painted with yellow, green, and brown lead glazes, which in the firing have been partly absorbed into the body. However that may be, the important fact remains that after his return from Tahiti Gauguin chose to make ceramic sculptures of two of his most important exotic motifs: viz. Oviri, which a few years before his death he asked Monfreid to have placed on his tomb, and this tete de sauvage, in which, more strongly than in any of his paintings, he pictures man as an embodiment of primitive force. It may be added that Degas's purchase of Gauguin's painting Hina and Tefatou at the Durand-Ruel show in 1893 may have prompted him to repeat Tefatou's features in an even more emphatic form as sculpture. B. GAUGUIN'S NOA NOA MASK In my book on Gauguin's Ceramics I suggested that the 'masque 6maillie' mentioned by Gauguin in his letter to Mon- freid of December 1896, which has been identified above as the mask in Reunion, might possibly be the horned mask of a man known today only from two faded photographs pasted into Noa Noa (Fig.57). On the face of it, there is nothing to prove that this is actually the work of Gauguin, nor do we know in what kind of material it was executed. That the motif was of importance to him can, however, be seen from the fact that he introduced it into two of his draw- ings, one of which, seen in Fig.58, is also known (reversed) from a monotype, while the other is known (reversed) from a monotype only (Rewald: Drawings, 1958, Figs.120 and 121), where it appears with a sinister effect in connexion with the figure of a Polynesian woman. The mask also appears in a wood-cut (Guirin, No.67). It has not hitherto been found possible to ascertain the source of the Noa Noa mask with anything like certainty. The present writer has called attention to certain Japanese horned masks as a possible inspiration, while Dr Gray has attempted to place the horned mask in the context of Poly- nesian mythology by means of a circumstantial hypothesis that does not lend itself to a brief summary, and which is therefore cited in toto in note 13. 9 Lettres &amp;i Daniel de Monfreid, ed. A. Joly-Segalen, Paris [1950], letter No.xxvII, P-97. 10 JOHN REWALD: 'The Genius and the Dealer,' in Art News [May 19591], pp.3o-I, 62-5. In my book on Gauguin's Ceramics [1964], note 84, I have suggested that it might be the mask, published by Rewald, Gauguin was referring to in his letter. 11 Lettres '&amp; Daniel de Monfreid, ed. A. Joly-Segalen, Paris [1950], letter No.xxxi, p. 104. 12 JOHN REWALD: OF. Cit., [I959]. Rewald also points out the similarity between this mask and the head in Gauguin's La Guerre et la Paix (Gray [1963], 127). 13 After pointing out that the head cannot be 'a traditional symbol of a nature god', the bull being unknown in Polynesia before the arrival of the Europeans,</page><page sequence="7">GAUGUIN STUDIES As the features of the mask are markedly sauvage, and as Gauguin used it in connexion with Polynesian motifs, the search for its source has thus hitherto been directed towards pictorial and mythological traditions outside those of the European cultural sphere. And yet the fact is that here Gauguin once more used a theme from Greek art, trans- forming it to suit his own purposes. Not only the horns but also the ears of this human head are those of a bull, as can be seen clearly in Fig.58, where the head is drawn in three- quarter profile. This is not a man with bull's horns, but, as in Greek mythology, a bull with a man's face: it is Achelous, the River Bull, whom Hercules fought. If one disregards for the moment the grim exotic features of the Noa Noa mask, its connexion with the little antique terra-cotta head as reproduced here in Fig.55 at once becomes apparent, in spite of the archaic smile indicated by the mouth and the softly modelled cheeks. There can, it seems to me, be no doubt that the maker of the Noa Noa mask must have known the head of Achelous as it appears in the little Greek-Ionian terra-cottas used in Antiquity as scent bottles.14 Of these, at least some ten are now in various European museums.15 The one reproduced here - one of the biggest and finest of the group - is of particular interest in the present connexion, because it is in the Louvre, which acquired it with the Campana Collection in 1863. There Gauguin may thus have seen it, and it may well be that this anthropomorphic vessel, in which the head and the bottle shape are fused, appealed to him in his search for exotic and untraditional models for his own ceramics. If the enigmatic Noa Noa mask can thus be regarded as a Greek sculpture which has been given an exotic physiog- nomy, it seems probable that it is the work of Gauguin him- self; for this combination could hardly be possible in any other artist of the time. It is true that the mask - at least to judge from the very poor photos in Noa Noa - shows a firmer mastery of form than is usually found in Gauguin's sculptures. Yet, these qualities are also characteristic of the best of his Tahiti drawings, for instance the two in which the mask was used as a motif. There remains the problem of the dating, which in its turn links up with the question what material was used. Here, there are two possibilities: it may have been executed in stoneware and, if so, in Paris 1893-5, or it may have been carved in wood and, if so, during Gauguin's second stay in Tahiti. The smooth surface of the mask shown by the photo points to a hard material like stoneware, but is on the other hand also compatible with polished wood. That it was inspired by the Louvre Achelous - or possibly a photograph of the latter - indicates that this motif was known to Gauguin already in Paris. Many of the photographs and drawings that Gauguin collected in Paris and took with him to the Pacific he did not, however, use till later years. As Dr Richard Field has shown in his important study Gauguin plagiateur ou crdateur,16 it was especially in 1896 that Gauguin drew on this store of photos for his figure motifs, and during that year, besides Baraboudour, Greek sculpture was his principal source of inspiration.17 If the horned mask was carved in wood - which seems most likely, seeing that the horns look as if they may have been added separately and that there is something that looks like a crack across the bridge of the nose - it should then un- doubtedly be referred to 1896. This date is also supported by the fact that the woman in Gauguin's drawing (Fig.58) is substantially the same motif as in his painting Te Arii Vahine, dated 1896.18 But however that may be, one thing is beyond doubt: it was the two photos in Noa Noa, and not the mask itself, that were used by Gauguin as models when he drew the mask; en face (and reversed) in the monotype (Rewald, Fig.i20), where a human torso has been added to the mask; in three- quarter profile, facing right, as in the drawing (Fig.58) and (reversed) in the monotype executed after the latter (Rewald, Fig.I 21). How closely Gauguin studied these two photos can be seen from the accuracy with which the outline of the face has been copied in both cases and by the way in which quite small details, like the white reflections in the eyeballs Dr Gray goes on (pp.3Io-i I): Though no exact determination of the signific- ance of this figure appears to be possible, there are a number of suggestive clues. In the first place, the Polynesian language uses a common word for tooth, tusk, and horn - niho. Thus the native term for a ram is pua'a-niho, literally horned-pig. According to Henry, the god Nihoniho-tetei was a fierce ghoul (Ancient Tahiti, p.417). Literally, this name can be translated 'adorned with jutting out horns or teeth'. Another clue is found in Linton's statement that the young men of the Marquesas used to put their hair up in two knots on either side of the head, and that 'when the hair was dressed with two knots the center and back of the head was shaved, the tapa wrapped knots protruding like horns from the bare skull'. (LINTON: The Material Culture of the Marquesas Islands (Memoirs VIII of the Bernice Pauhai Bishop Museum 1923, P-419)). Finally, it should be remembered that anthropophagy was a very real memory in the minds of the natives of the Marquesas at the time that Gauguin was there. If we put all these elements together the result is that the figure seems to represent a 'young man-eating warrior-god'. This description perhaps best fits the god 'Oro, one of the chief patrons of the Tahitians, whose sacred animal was the pig. In the Marquesas, the name of 'Oro was Koro, while that of the bull in the Polynesian language was pua'a-toro. As the consonants 'k' and 't' are not strongly distinguished in the Polynesian language, it may be possible that the Marquesan puaka-toro, their term for bull suggested to Gauguinpuaka-Koro, that is the god 'Oro in his animal avatar. 14 Louvre (H 40).

It is only when the head is seen enface, as in the present photograph, that the con- nexion is so striking. In profile, showing the jutting beard characteristic of all representations of Achelous, as well as the bottle shape, the effect is less monu- mental. 15 E. V.

In his chapter 'Gauguin plagiateur ou createur' (in Gauguin. Collection Genies et Realites, Paris [i960], pp.i39-48, 161-9) DR FIELD has, however, pointed out that these loans from photographs were much more numerous than previously supposed. The sources were, besides the catalogue of the Arosa sale in 1878, the many books on art, which Gustave Arosa illustrated with photogravures and of which Dr Field gives a full list in his as yet unpublished thesis (MS. 1963). Gauguin's loans of horse motifs from Greek sculpture (as well as from Degas) have recently been dealt with by WILLIAM M. CANE: 'Gauguin's Le Cheval Blanc: Sources and Syncretic Meanings', THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE [July 1966], pp.352--62. 17 In this connexion it might be mentioned that in the park of Auguste Goupil's country place at Punaauia, which Gauguin frequently visited during some months in 1896 when he gave drawing lessons to Goupil's daughters, there were 'some huge casts of Greek statues' (see BENGT DANIELSSON: Gauguin in the South Seas, London [1965], p.x88). 18 Most likely it was Gauguin's vahine Pau'ura that served as a model for the woman in the painting and the drawing. Her features are, furthermore, believed to be preserved in a wooden mask, known today only from a photo- graph (GRAY [1963] No. 129) and from a drawing by Victor Segalen. If so, this seems to link the Noa Noa mask with the very fine, monumental mask of Pau'ura. This mask, Dr Gray suggests, may have been the one that belonged to Goupil. If so, the latter must have acquired it in 1896 at the latest, while he and Gauguin were still on friendly terms.</page><page sequence="8">i4 W~ ~ eo - ,.. a c T. .. -'. .. -e rc a I- d C d c~ F4 - 02 *-- 0 .o , Q, cl Q: Cr e o u. .

C. SOME UNPUBLISHED CHILD PORTRAITS BY GAUGUIN The selection of Gauguin's works shown at the 'Frie Ud- stilling' in Copenhagen in the spring of 1893 fell into three groups. The most sensational of these was made up of the ten canvases that he sent to the exhibition from Tahiti. The rest of the exhibits, totalling forty-one, were: a number of works executed in Paris and Copenhagen up to I885, and left behind in Denmark when he returned to Paris in 1885; and furthermore works mainly from Brittany and Arles, some of which were sent to his wife in Copenhagen, while others had been taken home by her during her visits to Paris in 1887 and 1892.20 Among the works from before 1885 were five sculptures, all of them belonging to Mette Gauguin in 1893, viz. No.12o: Emil. Bust in marble; No.126: Valerie Roumi. Med- allion in wood and plaster; No.127: Aline. Bust in wax; No.I28: Clovis. Bust in wood and wax; and No.I69: Bust in marble (which must have been the portrait bust of Mette Gauguin). Of these, three are well known today, viz. the marble busts of Emil (Metropolitan Museum), that of Mette (Cour- tauld Institute), and the bust of Clovis (Private Collection, Paris). These are listed in Christopher Gray's euvre cata- logue21 as Nos. i, 2 and 6. Dr Gray seems, however, to have overlooked the Copenhagen exhibition of 1893, to whose catalogue he gives no reference. This must then be the reason why he makes no attempt in his book to identify the portrait of 'Valerie Roumi' exhibited on that occasion. The identification presents, however, no difficulty if one remembers that Valdry Roumy was a well-known cabaret singer in Paris. There can be no doubt that it is she that Gauguin portrayed in his medallion relief of a singing woman (Fig.59). This medallion Dr Gray does, in fact, in- clude in his catalogue as No.3, using the title under which it had been exhibited at the Impressionist Exhibition of 1881 as No.38: 'La Chanteuse'. That the medallion is a portrait of Valdry Roumy and that Gauguin must have known her is proved by a pastel by Forain in the Print Room of the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen (Fig.63). For this pastel, which can be traced back to Gauguin's collection, bears the following inscription on the back: 'Valery Roumy (Montmartroise) ca.I880 donn6 par F. au peintre Paul Gauguin.' It is indeed this woman's features, made slightly more robust, that we find in Gauguin's medallion from I880. In his appendix, as catalogue No.A-2 (p.301), Dr Gray mentions an unknown bust of Aline, but gives no reference to the catalogue of the 'Frie Udstilling' 1893, No.127: 'Aline. 1882. Bust in wax. Mette Gauguin's collection'. Dr Gray comments on this bust as follows: 'According to the catalogue of the Gauguin exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1955, Gauguin made a wax bust of his daughter Aline in I88o (Tate Gallery Catalogue, London, 1955, P-39). M. Maurice Malingue has informed the author that there is a bronze bust of Aline in a private collection in Denmark. It is probably a cast of this wax. I have been unable to trace this work in Denmark.' M. Malingue's bust in bronze, alleged to be in Denmark, is unknown to me, but in the Nasjonalgalleri in Oslo I recently came across a collection of old negatives, among which I found an unpublished child bust (Fig.61), signed P. Gauguin with an indistinct date mark that seems to be: '77' (Fig.6o).22 The reading of the date being uncertain, this portrait is difficult to assess as it does not stylistically compare with any other of Gauguin's early sculptures. A decisive factor in the dating must therefore be the possible identifica- tion of the child, and here we are in the fortunate position that we know with some certainty what both Emil and Aline looked like at the age of 3. As for Emil, his looks are known to us from the little paint- ing (Fig.62) which the Wildenstein-Cogniat catalogue con- vincingly refers to 1877 (W 24). A comparison between this remarkable little portrait and the sensitively modelled wax bust seems to show that the features correspond in all essen- tials: the regular oval shape of the head, the hair smoothed sideways over the forehead, the somewhat stubby nose just beginning to develop, the full and slightly pouting lips, and the deep-set shaded eyes. If this can be accepted, the bust must be a portrait at the age of 3 of Emil, who was born 3oth August, 1874 and the date rightly read as 77. That Aline, whose date of birth was 24th December 1877, was in fact quite a different type of child from Emil can easily be seen from two unpublished portraits,23, i.e. a draw- ing of her in coloured chalk at the age of 324 (Fig.64), and a curious double portrait in oil, signed 'P. Gauguin 83' (detail, Fig.68), showing her at the age of 5 both en face and in profile25 (Fig.65). Both in the drawing and in the oil the oval of the face is somewhat broad. In the en face of the oil portrait, however, the nose is already seen to have grown long and sharp while the mouth is small and pursed up. The two latter features are also characteristic of a drawing26 19 Thus in the drawing the white gleam of light, caught in the right eye of the mask when it was photographed, has been transformed into an upturned iris and pupil, while the iris of the left eye is dark, and turned downward with a kind of blind look. 20 See BENGT DANIELSSON: Gauguin in the South Seas, London [19651, P-94- 21 CHRISTOPHER GRAY: Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin, Baltimore [x 963]. 22 Except for the capital P the signature of the bust is completely in accordance with Gauguin's signature known from paintings and drawings from 1877 (see THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE [June 1965], Figs.25-6 and 38-9). 23 There exist several child portraits that with varying degree of certainty have been taken to represent Aline. In the present article I have confined myself to portraits relevant to my argument, whose identification is beyond doubt. 24 This drawing of Aline belonged to Mette Gauguin's close Copenhagen friend Karen Lehmann, nee Wiehe, who gave it to Mette on the death of Aline. On the back of the drawing Mette wrote that when she died it was to be given back to Karen Lehmann. It still belongs to the Lehmann family. It was shown at the Gauguin Exhibition in Copenhagen, 1948, as No.68. 25 The portrait is not included in the WILDENSTEIN-COGNIAT Catalogue, I, 1964. My thanks are due to the present owner in New York for giving me an oppor- tunity to study it in Copenhagen and to compare it with the pastel (W 35), in a private collection in Denmark. It is listed in the catalogue of the Parke- Bernet sale, 16th March 1960, as No.74 (colour ill.), the provenance there being given as: Paul Rosenberg, Paris; Collection of Baroness Eva Gourgaud, Paris; Gourgaud Foundation. It should be added that the surface of the enface portrait is smoother and without the cracks visible in other parts of the painting. It may thus have been restored, possibly in connexion with the relining of the painting. 26 Reproduced in MAURICE MALINGUE: Paul Gauguin, Paris [1948], p.19.</page><page sequence="11">GAUGUIN STUDIES (Fig.67) evidently made some time after Aline had all of her hair cut off in 1883.27 The face has become narrower and the eyes now have the resentful look found in most photographs of her at this age. The profile of the oil portrait from 1883 on the other hand has much in common with the profile of Aline in the beautiful large-scale pastel of her and Pola (W 135), executed in Copenhagen 1885, where her hair is seen to have grown again to its natural length. It is quite probable that Gauguin may have done other portrait busts of his children than those known today. A leaf of his sketch-book in the Nationalmuseum of Stockholm (Fig.66) with drawings of some of his children (Aline and Jean?) also bears a sketch for the bust of a small boy, that cannot be identified as the busts known to us of Emil and of Clovis. One cannot therefore exclude the possibility that a bust of Aline may some day turn up, identifiable as the one that was shown at the 'Frie Udstilling' in 1893, and there dated 1882. All things considered, I am, however, inclined to believe that it was actually the wax bust of Emil that was 'exhibited in 1893 at the 'Frie Udstilling' in Copenhagen under a wrong name and a wrong date, the latter being a natural consequence of the former.28 The marble bust of Emil, with its technical bravura and its rather vacant expression, has always seemed to me to occupy a rather isolated position in Gauguin's weuvre. It is believed to have been executed in marble by Gauguin him- self in 1878. In the wax bust, however, which must be one of the stages that preceded it, the original sensitiveness of the modelling has been completely preserved. It thus forms a link with the small portraits that Gauguin drew or painted of his children in early years. The bust of Mette - usually stated to have been executed by Bouillot in 1877 - is a competently carved marble, which seems to have preserved much of the original expressiveness of the features. Perhaps it is an early stage of this bust - or perhaps even Gauguin's original model - that is reported by Pissarro's son Ludovic-Rodo to have been in his father's house at Osny.29 We must hope that some day this portrait of Mette, as well as the wax bust of Emil, will turn up again, so as to give us a fuller picture of Gauguin's early phase as a sculptor. In this connexion it is worth while recalling that when invited by Pissarro and Degas to join the Fourth Impression- ist Exhibition in 1879, Gauguin chose to be represented by one of his sculptures. His name was not listed in the catalogue of that year and it has never been discussed which of his sculptures he exhibited on this occasion. All that we know is that his was the only sculpture at the exhibition that year, and that Duranty refers to it as 'une petite sculpture agrdable'.30 One would hardly expect the bust of Mette to be described in these terms. Could there, one wonders, in 1879 have been other sculptures by Gauguin suitable for exhibition than his bust of Emil? Among Gauguin's work listed in the catalogue of the Fifth Exhibition in I88o only one sculpture is to be found, namely, No.62: 'Buste marbre'. This must in any case have been either Mette or Emil. D. GAUGUIN'S CASSATT When in the summer of 1885 Gauguin left Copenhagen to return to Paris with his son Clovis, he left behind him in Denmark a remarkable collection of Impressionist pain- tings. When his wife soon after found herself in financial straits, she began to sell his pictures to her friends and re- latives. Alarmed at this, Gauguin wrote to her in November 1885, telling her to stop her sales: the two Cezannes would some day become very valuable, and she must on no account dispose of these and the Pissarros. 'Vends plutdt le dessin de Degas'. .. 'sauf le Manet Miss Cassatt ilfaut arriter la vente sinon je n'aurai plus rien un jour.'31 He thus gave her a free hand as regards the sale of the works of Degas, Manet, and Mary Cassatt in his collection. In the list of paintings still remaining in his collection that Gauguin drew up in his sketch-book about the end of 1887,32 no mention is made of Manet and Degas, whose pictures must thus have been sold by then, but Mary Cassatt figures as 'Miss Cassatt jeune fille a' l'ventail' (but un- fortunately with no measurements given). At the exhibition of the Kunstforening in Copenhagen, in November 1889, all the pictures from Gauguin's Collec- tion, including those that had already been sold by Mette Gauguin, were shown. After having mentioned Manet's pastelfemme enceinte and Degas's pastel of a ballet dancer, the art critic Karl Madsen in his review of the exhibition goes on to deal with the Mary Cassatt at considerable length:33 'Curiously enough - and heaven knows how - Degas has got a pupil in the person of the American Miss Mary Cassatt, who is repre- sented by a beautiful pastel, an excellent example of her specific genre. It is a half-length portrait of a young lady, seated in a box at an opera, the background being a large mirror, which reflects the blurred outlines of the chandelier, the curved lines of the balconies, and the young lady's neck and reddish hair. Below, the big half-circle of a Japanese fan forms a fine decorative pattern. The lady is seen almost in profile, and this profile is rendered with a delicacy that one would look for in vain from any Danish artist, past or present. Her nose, her mouth, and her chin, presented in delicate half-tones of light and shade, are superbly drawn. But the best thing in the picture is perhaps her glance - the marvellous rendering of her expressive dark eyes, which are, perhaps, slightly too close to each other. The treatment of the whole subject is at the same time light and firm, and the colours have a singular perfection. This is a picture to make our Danish painters blush for their clumsy hands. One wishes that we could have a teacher like Degas in this country.' Both the two pastels by Degas and Manet shown at this exhibition can be identified,34 but the Cassatt does not appear to have been dealt with in the literature on this 27 In some of Gauguin's paintings from 1881 Aline is already seen to have had her hair cut short (W 51, signed and dated I88I; W 67, undated, most likely painted in I88I). In an undated letter, which must have been written early in 1883, Gauguin, however, tells Pissarro that he has had to 'faire tondre tout ras ma petite flUe'. The double portrait, showing Aline both en face and in profile, Gauguin may have painted as a memento of what she looked like before this distressing event. 28 It might perhaps be difficult to credit this explanation, were it not that the list of Gauguin's works at this exhibition contains so many errors that one may expect anything in this respect. 29 See JOHN REWALD: The History of Impressionism, New York [1961], P.479, note 2 1. 30 [EDMOND] DURANTY in La Chronique des Arts [I9th April 1879], pp. 127-8 (reference given by REWALD, Op.

Failing the proposed loan from Brandes, he writes, Degas would not be as well represented as one might wish, and Mary Cassatt would not be represented at all. Brandes, however, refused on this occasion to lend his pictures.37 The Degas pastel was later on acquired by the Ordrup- gArd Collection at Copenhagen, while the Manet pastel cropped up in Germany, first at the Galerie Matthiesen in 192838 and subsequently at an exhibition at Gold's in Berlin, 1930, where it was reproduced in the catalogue of the latter.39 This catalogue also reproduces a picture by Mary Cassatt: a young woman seen in profile seated in a theatre box and holding an open fan that takes up most of the lower part of the picture (Fig.69). A comparison with Karl Madsen's description of the pastel at the 1889 exhibition shows a point by point correspondence. It is obviously the same picture, and Edvard Brandes's Cassatt must thus have shared the fate of his Manet, and finished up at Gold's in Berlin. But beyond this point all traces of the Cassatt pastel appear to be lost. Mr Frederick A. Sweet, to whom I have submitted a reproduction of the pastel together with information as to its provenance, has stated that the picture is unknown to him, and that he regards it as improbable that it should be in the U.S.A. today. Nor has Mrs Adelyn D. Breeskin, to whom my enquiry was transmitted, been able to carry its provenance any farther. The question remains where and how Gauguin acquired the picture. From 1879, when he first exhibited together with the Impressionists, he had contacts with Mary Cassatt, who took part in the Impressionist Exhibitions of 1879, I88o, 1881, and I886. The catalogues list her name but not the works she exhibited. In 1879 she is, however, known to have exhibited a total of twelve pictures in oil, tempera, and pastel, among them Woman in a theatre box and Study of a woman with afan. The former, No.49 in the exhibition, which is known from a contemporary cartoon in Charivari,40 is not identical with Gauguin's pastel, but the latter may be. How- ever, Mary Cassatt did many pictures of women with fans, and the pastel that Gauguin acquired may just as well have been among those on exhibition in I88o or I881. In this connexion it should, however, be mentioned that Gauguin probably got the Cassatt in exchange for one of his own pictures, for his sketch-book list of works he sold or exchanged includes the item: 'Miss Cassatt Neige dchange'.41 The only one of Gauguin's snowscapes known today whose provenance does not exclude the possibility that it may have belonged to Mary Cassatt is that which is now in the Budapest Museum of Art,42 and which was bought in 1907 from the Galerie Hessel in Paris. This picture, bearing the date 1879, must be the one that Gauguin exhibited at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition in I88o as No.57 (Wilden- stein, 37). Mary Cassatt is known to have owned several impression- ist pictures, but according to Mr Frederick A. Sweet no information is available to the effect that she owned one by Gauguin. It is, however, on record that she had a C6zanne, which she sold in order to buy a Courbet. It is thus possible that she may also have disposed of Gauguin's Effet de neige in a similar way at some date before I907. and in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE [January 1966], p.35 (in comments on W 131).
