London: Oxford University Press, 1964. ?3 3s. Professor Giedion's book is the second of two volumes produced under the title of The eternal present as a result of the six A. W. Mellon lectures delivered in 1957 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The first volume, entitled The beginnings of art, dealt with pre-history. This second vol- ume takes the story as far as the end of the first two high civilisations-Egypt and Sumer. The theme of both volumes is summed up by the author as that of constancy and change. Thus he quotes Kurt Sethe's remark of the Egyptians that 'their eggshells always remain with them'-the Egyptian experienced no difficulty in juxtaposing new and old. Indeed Giedion shows how certain pre-historic elements persist until the end of Egypt's existence. One of the most important links which survives through these ancient civilisa- tions is the attitude towards animals and the conception of all life. From this continuity arises the concept of an anthropomorphic cosmos with a natural extension to the recognition of the human body and its portrayal in sculpture. Never- theless, pal?olithic or neolithic art forms live on with astonishing persistence, particularly the emphasis upon the outline in sunken stone relief sculpture. Giedion then goes on to trace the origins of monumental architecture in Mesopotamia. 5+M He compares the ziggurats (expressing a priesthood and deity system which is open and accessible to the people) with the pyramid (expressing an inaccessible priesthood and system of deity remote from everyday life). From this it is a short step to the stone architecture of the Zoser complex in Egypt, and Giedion shows how this building relates to the Egyptian concept of the Ka. Moving from the pyramids and the great temples (their layout expressing the eternal wandering) Giedion describes the temple of Queen Hat- sheput, and this leads him on to a discussion of the supremacy of the vertical. He regards this as one of the great changes from pre- history. Art and religion in pre-history established equal rights in all directions. In the first high civilisations all directions became subservient to the vertical, and composition was governed by the need to relate to this dimension. Thus, he says, arose the beginning of architecture. It is a fascinating theme, and it is a pity that Professor Giedion's book does not state it more clearly. The action is episodic and gives the impression of a collation of notes rather than a structured treatise. A further reservation is that the book is based upon the reading of available architec- tural evidence and, of course, this evidence consists in the main of monumental structures. Although a case can be made that the whole story of a people's attitude and life can be read in the momuments they leave behind, Giedion does not argue the case very well. However, the volume is full of illuminating and provocative thoughts. One of the most intriguing of these concerns Giedion's view on the relationship of client and architect. He holds strongly to the view that great architecture can only be achieved by the close union of an enlightened client with a planner or designer of genius. He highlights the role of the client/architect relationship when he describes the bond between King Zoser and Imhotep. The King entrusted Imhotep with the highest offices in the land, he was 'grand vizier, chief judge', bearer of the royal seal', and 'supervisor of that which Heaven brings, the Earth creates, and the Nile brings' and' supervisor of everything in this entire land'. This was power beyond the dreams of any designer today and although the Zoser complex, designed by Imhotep, is undoubtedly the work of genius, one is entitled to question whether it is necessary, in order to design a satisfactory temple, to be, in fact, 'supervisor of everything in this entire land'. Giedion pursues this theme of architect and client even further when he considers the great mortuary temple designed by Senmut for Queen Hatsheput. Senmut, like Imhotep, possessed almost unlimited</page><page sequence="2">IO8 BOOK REVIEWS powers. He was 'overseer of all of the works of the king'. But, even more than this, the relationship between Queen Hatsheput and her architect was, to say the least, very close. Queen Hatsheput made her architect 'super- intendent of the private apartments, of the bathroom and of the royal bedrooms' as well. Again the openness, sweep and design of the temple are beyond doubt the work of a genius, but this perhaps could have been achieved without quite such a close relation- ship between the people involved. Certainly today not many architects would carry relationships with their clients to this extent. All in all, the book is tantalising for the flashes of insight which it provides, covering the early development of architecture. Because these are not followed up in a suffici- ently close argument, one feels somewhat frustrated at the finish. Perhaps we can hope for another volume which will treat the same themes with the vigour that Professor Giedion brought to his earlier books Space, time and architecture and Mechanization takes command.
