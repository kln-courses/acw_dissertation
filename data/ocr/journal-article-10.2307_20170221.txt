<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science A Prolegomenon to Cognitive Archaeology DAVID S. WHITLEY Science, after all, is a branch of literature. ?Sir Karl Popper, Objective Knowledge, p. 185 Archaeology sits at an interface. Having finally evolved through (some had hoped beyond) the growth pangs of new archaeol ogy, it is now undergoing a second, similar period of debate, with issues of epistemology, ontology, and metaphysics once again in the fore. That is, current theoretical discourse involves a reconsideration of the "processualist" positivism of new archaeology and the evalua tion of "post-processual," "symbolic," or "radical" approaches (cf. Hodder 1986; Leone 1982; Binford 1987; Earle and Preucel 1987; Shanks and Tilley 1987a; Schiffer 1988). Following Huffman (1986a; cf. Lewis-Williams 1989), I prefer a particular brand of post-proces sual archaeology labeled "cognitive archaeology," but the appellative is not so important as the substance. Cognitive archaeology specifically and post-processual archaeol ogy more generally are, admittedly, much less than universally or even widely accepted in our discipline. Some view many of the con tentions raised by their advocates as fundamentally inappropriate to science (e.g., Binford 1987). Others, equally strongly, see them as central concerns in archaeology's heuristic (e.g., Hodder 1986), even while certain critics seem to question the ability of post-processual approaches to contribute to our understanding of the prehistoric past (e.g., Earle and Preucel 1987). Yet on the empirical and practical levels, at least, there are two substantive areas in which cognitive archaeology, that is, the post-processual approach practiced princi 2 57</page><page sequence="2">58 David S. Whitley pally by archaeologists associated with the University of the Wit water srand, specifically is making great inroads: African iron-age studies (e.g., Huffman 1981, 1982, 1984, 1986a, 1986b; Thorp 1984a, 1984b; Loubser 1985, 1988; Evers 1989) and hunter-gatherer research (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, etc.; Lewis-Wil liams and Dowson 1988, 1989; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986; Whitley 1982, 1988a, 1992; Huffman 1983; Wadley 1986,1987; Camp bell 1986, 1987; Dowson 1988a, 1988b). It is the purpose of this essay to review these cognitive archaeological studies, but not principally in terms of empirical substance. To do so without attending first to the theoretical bases of cognitive archaeology would be incautious. Aside from the fact that many processual archaeologists are simply unfamiliar with this literature, it is apparent that those that have considered it maintain certain misconstrued beliefs. Further, as implied above, it is also true that there is more than one brand of post-processual archaeology and that distinctions be tween various strains have been little explored in the literature. Thus, a consideration of cognitive archaeology's substantive ad vances can only be predicated on a necessarily antecedent review of the philosophical and methodological issues these entail. I begin with these, before turning briefly to two case studies of the approach in practice. Intellectual Bases of Cognitive Archaeology Critiques of the positivism (or, more correctly, logical empiricism) that underpinned new archaeology have been presented by a number of authors from various viewpoints (e.g., Wylie 1981; Flannery 1982; Hodder 1986; Shanks and Tilley 1987b; Kelley and Hanen 1988) and need not be reiterated here. Suffice it simply to note that the perception of a scientific archaeology as necessarily part of Otto Neurath's "unified science," following a formalized (principally Hempelian) positivist model, is now widely recognized as an overly narrow characterization, even by some of the original proponents of the new archaeology program. Ironically, though, even as processual archaeologists are reworking their philosophical and methodological commitments to bring them in line with recent de velopments in the philosophy of science, scientific archaeology is being caricatured by certain post-processualists (e.g., Hodder 1986;</page><page sequence="3">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 59 Shanks and Tilley 1987b) in exactly the old-fashioned positivist mode that many new archaeologists are moving beyond. That the early new archaeological treatises and some of the more vocal post-processualists share (or shared) the same flawed, positivist perception of science is, however, more than simply anecdotal. For with this misperception on the side of certain post-processualists, there is an equally debilitating and parallel misconstrual on the part of most processual archaeologists, which is that any opposition to their processualist goals is, somehow, an opposition to science and necessarily a committment to relativism. Just as narrow positivism has become a whipping post for segments of the post-processualist persuasion, in other words, so too has an extreme relativism been taken as the hallmark of post-processual archaeology. But, in fact, these philosophical and methodological commitments do not necessarily follow. Anti-positivism does not equate with anti science, or at least need not so, and neither necessarily does an anti processualism imply relativism. Instead, when "post-positivist" developments in the philosophy of science are acknowledged, an archaeology that is both scientific and hermeneutic?cognitive ar chaeology?is allowed. Indeed, it suggests that archaeology funda mentally is an interpretive endeavor, but one in which scientific method and heuristic play their part. In order to understand this intellectual position adopted by cogni tive archaeologists, and implicitly how this differs from other post processualist as well as processualist positions, I outline two impor tant intellectual developments that have been fundamental to its appearance: changes in culture theory in anthropology, and the rise of post-positivist philosophy of science. Archaeology, Culture Theory, and the Cognitive Paradigm Although recently there appear to have been some dissenting voices, for over three decades North American archaeologists have by and large adopted the catch-phrase "archaeology as anthropology" as a rallying cry, if not an ideological precept. This is ironic because just as archaeologists were emphasizing their intellectual ties and al legiance to their "mother-discipline," they apparently turned their backs on certain major intellectual transitions then occurring within anthropology. Specifically, shortly after Phillip Phillips published the oft-quoted remark "archaeology is anthropology, or it is nothing"</page><page sequence="4">60 David S. Whitley (1955:246-47), and following earlier intellectual trends in psychol ogy and linguistics, anthropologists such as Ward Goodenough, An thony F. C. Wallace, David Schneider and others began the move to wards a "cognitive revolution," resulting in what is now generally referred to as cognitive or symbolic anthropology (cf. D'Andrade 1984:88). Whether or not this constituted an anthropological "para digm shift" (Kuhn 1962), or an alteration in the "theoretical hard core" (Lakatos 1969), is arguable, but it certainly changed in funda mental ways the manner in which most anthropologists viewed the world, and their intellectual task in understanding it. This is apparent when it is recognized that, prior to the mid-1950s, anthropology was dominated by the belief that most things human, including personality, language, and culture, could be best under stood in terms of stimulus-response relationships (D'Andrade 1984; Le Vine 1984). For the anthropologist, and by derivation the archaeol ogist, this "behaviorism" was most manifest in the then-existing defi nition of culture. Simply stated, culture was defined in reference to patterns of behavior, with explanations of culture change or cultural differences most frequently framed in terms of human-environment relationships. But, starting about 1957, the behaviorist paradigm was rejected by many in anthropology (and other human sciences) in favor of a cognitive formulation.1 Here, rather than emphasizing nor mative patterns of action, concern shifted to a definition of culture as a system of values and beliefs or, in a word, a worldview. Although this change in culture theory has not been adopted by processualist archaeologists, including many who consider them selves "anthropological archaeologists," cognitive culture theory is fundamental to cognitive archaeology, and a few summary points concerning its ramifications need be made. The first of these is that this change in culture theory implies a shift in the emphasis of social inquiry from the purely behavioral realm to better include the cogni tive. I discuss this in more detail below, but here I wish to emphasize one implication and what it suggests concerning the explanatory capability of one strain of processual archaeology, "behavioral ar chaeology" as espoused specifically by Earle and Preucel (1987). This is that archaeologists employ remnants of prehistoric behavior, whether expressed in artifacts, monuments, sites, associations, or contexts, as their evidence. Since the results of behavior are funda mentally our evidence, it is then a logical inversion to argue that our goal is to seek laws to explain our evidence, as Earle and Preucel</page><page sequence="5">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 61 claim. "One uses human behavior as evidence for the operation of the mind," John Searle (1982:2) noted in a parallel vein, "but to sup pose that the laws must be laws of behavior is to suppose that the evidence must be the subject matter." Indeed, it is only if the subject of inquiry is extended beyond the level of behavior, to what causes behavior, that any hope can be raised of achieving explanatory laws (cf. Jarvie 1972:18; Farr 1983:171). For this reason, cognitive archaeologists have adopted an approach roughly akin to Popper's (e.g., 1972, 1976) "situational analysis." In situational analysis Popper distinguishes what he calls "world-one" physical objects (which include behavior) from "world-two" subjec tive experiences, and both of these from "world-three" objects. These latter are the product of the human mind [not to be conflated with human emotions or psychological states, which are world two) and include art, myths, institutions, statements, arguments, etc.; that is, the cognitive (but not psychological) realm. "The innermost nucleus of world three," he states, "is the world of problems, theo ries and criticism" (1976:194). For Popper and other proponents of situational analysis (e.g., Jarvie 1972; Farr 1983) it is situational analysis, which explicitly considers world-three objects, that under lies law-like generalizations and makes explanation possible in so cial inquiry (cf. Farr 1983:171; see also Gibbon 1984:388-92). Now while Popper allows the narrow applicability of microeco nomic theories of rationality in situational analysis (cf. Popper 1961 : 141), he contends these are oversimplified, overschematicized, and therefore largely false. Correspondingly, they are inappropriate to the kinds of social contexts and problems that, for example, archaeol ogists confront (cf. Farr 1983:172). In other words, the application of problematic assumptions concerning industrialized, Western eco nomic behavior?economic rationality, maximization, optimiza tion, minimization, etc.?to non-Western, nonindustrialized cul tures amounts to implicit analogical reasoning founded on vague notions of universalities in human nature. Thus, although I recog nize that many processualists set their sights on the decision making behind prehistoric behavior, my contention is that the way they con ceptualize decision making is fundamentally faulty. That is, while their concern with decision making may in certain cases supersede the world-one realm of behavior, at best it leads to the psychologisms of world-two or, in other cases (e.g., optimal foraging theory), reduces explanation to a sociobiological focus on the behavior of the gene.</page><page sequence="6">62 David S. Whitley Situational analysis, by contrast, is "not based on any psychological assumptions concerning the rationality (or otherwise) of 'human na ture'" (Popper 1966:97). Therefore, many processualists' recourse to immanent psychological motives (e.g., maximization) as explana tions for behavior devolves rapidly to a kind of hermeneutics con cerned with psychologistic world-two objects. And such simply can not lead to satisfactory explanation. Second, many anthropologists have chosen to ally this change in culture theory with the humanistically based, generally relativist in tone, idealist critique. Hodder (e.g., 1986) has apparently adopted a similar relativist stance (cf. 1984:30), although without any explicit consideration of culture theory. But, in fact, the cognitive paradigm does not imply or require such a position. That is, nowhere does interest in cognition, symbolism, or belief necessarily imply a rela tivist or nonscientific approach or method (cf. Rudner 1966:74; Huff 1981, 1982; Farr 1983; see below); instead, such is simply a debatable metaphysical commitment. Perhaps most importantly, the retention of a scientific approach even within an interpretive program, such as is suggested by cognitive culture theory, is implied by a number of researchers (cf. Sch?lte 1986:8; Alexander 1982:138). Third, it is also important to emphasize that new archaeology ef fectively enshrined the behaviorist definition of culture. This is ironic on a number of counts, but particularly because one of the central tenets of new archaeology was a rejection of the "normative" approach of traditional archaeology. Yet the behaviorist paradigm and its resulting culture theory are paramountly normative. By con trast, as David Schneider has demonstrated a number of times (e.g., 1972:38), it is only with the cognitive paradigm that the "normative problem" is finally overcome. Here the distinction turns on the con ceptual difference between culture as "constitutive rules" (i.e., guidelines) in the cognitive paradigm and as "regulative rules" (or norms) in behaviorism. Post-processual archaeology and the cogni tive paradigm, therefore, do not necessarily imply a concern with "mental templates," as both Binford (1987) and Earle and Preucel (1987) seem to believe. Mental templates, instead, simply represent an aspect of the normative and one-dimensional model of cognition inherent in behaviorism. The normative contradiction of new archaeology, of course, has not gone unrecognized by processualists. Culture has been widely</page><page sequence="7">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 63 perceived as problematic, because the concept has not been viewed as "operational." But, instead of coming to terms with the concep tual contradiction, new archaeologists simply eliminated the con cept of culture from their vocabulary (e.g., Hill 1977:103; Trigger 1984:283-84). This, of course, was no new strategy. British social anthropologists had taken the same tactic in downplaying culture and favoring social structure (cf. Radcliffe-Brown 1952:192), and with the same result: "social anthropologists in fact had all the theoretical problems created for cultural anthropologists by the cul ture concept, and also the added problem of not realizing that they had the problems" (Sapire n.d.). For a number of reasons, consequently, the appearance of cogni tive/symbolic anthropology is an important intellectual develop ment in understanding the post-processual debate. Arguably it repre sents a larger "paradigmatic shift" from a behaviorist to a cognitive view of human culture and society, with cognitive archaeology repre senting a manifestation of this change. It also obviates the normative problem which has plagued archaeology for decades, and does this by revitalizing the central concept of any anthropological (and any an thropological archaeological) research: culture. Equally importantly, however, it implies no turn to an extreme relativist, anti-scientific approach to research. Post-Positivist Philosophy of Science In addition to an explicit recognition and adoption of cognitive cul ture theory now current in anthropology, specifically of culture as worldview, cognitive archaeologists have expressed a commitment to scientific method and heuristic (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1983; Lewis Williams and Loubser 1986; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988; Huff man 1986a). This, perhaps more than anything else, sets the cognitive archaeologists apart from other post-processualist strains. However, this reflects no adoption of doctrinaire positivist scientific methodol ogy, toward which other post-processualists and even now some pro cessualists look with disfavor.2 Instead, it represents a recognition of post-positivist developments in the philosophy of science, and it is to these that I now turn. Post-positivist philosophy of science is an intellectual movement that has appeared during the last two decades,- that is, since the initial</page><page sequence="8">64 David S. Whitley emergence of new archaeology. This is not to deny that it has earlier intellectual origins but simply to emphasize that it has experienced a sophisticated development in the recent past. Among its central tenets is the rejection of positivism's narrow emphasis on science as based on sense-data: it is recognized that there are many phenomena that are not directly observable (e.g., neutrinos) but that, nonethe less, have a material existence that is indirectly observable, based on their influence on other aspects of the material realm. That is, post positivist science has been marked by the rise of realism3 and its linkage with a rationalist method of science (discussed below). The fundamental postulates or presuppositions of post-positivist science have been summarized by Toulmin ( 1977:152) and Alexander (1982:18-33; 1987:17-18; cf. Taylor 1971) and can be fruitfully con sidered in contrast to those of positivism: 1. The relationship of theory and fact and the nature of scientific discourse. Positivism presupposed a radical break between fact and theory, with empirical observations held to be specific and concrete and nonempirical statements thought to be general and abstract. In contrast, post-positivist science maintains that all data are theoreti cally-informed. That is, a distinction in kind between theoretical and observational terms?what Nietzsche condemned a century ago as the "dogma of immaculate perception"?is now widely consid ered neither ontologically nor epistemologically supportable. In stead, as Lakatos (1969:156) has argued, to call some things "observa tions" and others "statements" is simply an analytical convenience based on a useful manner of speech (cf. Hesse 1974; Toulmin 1977: 152; Newton-Smith 1981:19-27; Kaplan 1984:34-35; Giddens and Turner 1987:2-3). However, that we recognize that these do not dif fer in kind does not imply that we cannot identify a distinction in degree between them; simply put, they are a useful manner of speech, and one which we should maintain. This allows rational con fidence (including, in some low-level cases, inter subjective invari ance) in scientific observations. Further, this postulate implies that scientific formulations have implicit or explicit commitments to metaphysical and empirical concerns; therefore science is not simply an activity that can be con ceptualized methodologically or empirically, for it necessarily incor porates the general and presuppositional. This is in contradistinction</page><page sequence="9">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 65 to hard-line positivism, which held that more general and abstract concerns had little significance for an empirically oriented disci pline. To ignore the philosophical side, however, runs the risk of implicit and unrecognized theoretical problems or misconstruals. As Alexander notes, "Reason can only be preserved by making presup positions explicit and subjecting them to disciplined debate" (1987: 52), and Reed contends that "attempts to'remove all philosophizing from a domain are likely to remove only explicit, potentially improv able ideas at the expense of embedding tacit, potentially damaging, ideas into the fabric of a field" (1981:477). This fact emphasizes the necessity of including general, theoretical discourse in archaeology, without awaiting the final resolution of archaeology's observation language, for example, as some seem wont to do. 2. The nature of scientific method. Scientific commitments are no longer made solely on empirical evidence or crucial, singular tests (cf. Polanyi 1958:92), as positivism maintained. That is, the search for some final falsifying or verifying evidence is considered inconclu sive, if not somewhat simplistic. Archaeology's regular controversies over the acceptance or rejection of certain key radiocarbon dates il lustrate this point in an inductivist way. Further, according to Lakatos (1969), it is often not clear what even constitutes a crucial test for a particular theory anyway, save in hindsight. Thus, Salmon (1982:37-38) states, "there exists both confirming and disconfirm ing evidence for many important hypotheses," while Kelley and Hanen (1988:241) note that "acceptance in science is always tenta tive. We adopt the hypothesis that has best survived testing, always ready to abandon it if additional research shows that another is more probable." This implicates a scientific method, which is to say a means of validation, not wedded to singular criteria, such as naive falsification, but instead more concerned with "inference to the best hypothesis," to employ Kelley and Hanen's phrase. 3. Theoretical change. Finally, "paradigm shifts" or transitions in a "theoretical hard-core" only occur when a match exists between em pirical evidence and convincing theoretical alternatives. But, be cause theoretical disputes are often implicit (cf. Holton 1973:26), they may go unrecognized in debates perceived as principally empir ical and methodological in nature. Just such a failure to recognize</page><page sequence="10">66 David S. Whitley the fundamental theoretical changes implied by post-processual ar chaeology is illustrated by Earle and Preucel (1987), who concluded that this simply represents a "critique" of new archaeology. These postulates are important for a number of reasons. First, and most significantly, they effectively undermine the foundation of positivism. As Alexander has shown in great detail ( 1982:18-33), the last two decades in the philosophy of science can be said to have unsettled the metaphysical, ontological, and epistemological posi tions upon which positivism was based. This, of course, justifies many of the criticisms of new archaeology that have been raised by the post-processualists, but of course similar criticisms have been raised by those more allied with processual archaeology as well (e.g., Kelley and Hanen 1988). Further, although the above points constitute the framework of post-positivist philosophy of science, they do not imply only a single approach to research; for the archaeologist, they do not entail a specific method for the study of the past. In fact, there is considerable room for variation in how these postulates are interpreted, particu larly the first, and these interpretations have had a great influence on the manifestation of post-processual and cognitive archaeology. That is, and contrary to what certain post-processualists would lead us to believe, the postulates of post-positivism do not only imply a relativist position. This is best understood if we consider the basis for a realist rationalism. Temperate Rationalism That scientific method and a rationalist approach are not antithetical to an interest in interpretation and the cognitive paradigm is demon strated by the philosopher of science William Newton-Smith (1981), who has outlined what he calls a "temperate rationalism" that illus trates the realist position adopted by the cognitive archaeologists. It consists of two components that, together, specify its program: a goal of science, and a principle or set of principles for comparing rival theories,- that is, a scientific heuristic and method. In consider ing the scientific goal, the temperate rationalist accepts a realist view of science. This includes an ontological position that holds that theories are true or false by virtue of how the world actually is, inde pendent of ourselves (this, of course, being a cleaned-up version of the "correspondance theory of truth"; cf. Davidson 1969; Elkana</page><page sequence="11">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 67 1978:312-13). It also includes a thesis of verisimilitude, in which it is held that the point of scientific enterprise is to discover explana tory truths about the world, but that these truths are verisimilar and inherently corrigible in the sense of only progressively approximat ing the real truth per se. Indeed, the "pessimistic induction" sug gests that all scientific theories will be disproven within about 200 years' time, but that they will be replaced by better theories, achiev ing increasing proximity to the real truth. The second component of rationalism, the set of principles by which theories are evaluated, has been elaborated by Newton-Smith in great detail (1981:226-30), and similar principles have been suggested by many other scholars (e.g., Kuhn 1962; Hempel 1966:33 46; Popper 1966:268; Lakatos 1969; Copi 1982:470-75; Farr 1983: 165; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986). It corresponds in its com mitments and essential elements to Kelley and Hanen's (1988) con tention that the validation of archaeological hypotheses should be based on inference to the best hypothesis. In summary form, what Newton-Smith calls the "good-making features of theories" are as follows: (1) observational nesting?the ability to preserve, while increas ing and improving over, the observational success of previous theories, (2) fertility?the provision of a scope or guidance for future devel opment; (3) track record?the record of success that an existing theory has accumulated; (4) inter-theory support?the ability to account for, or support, other, accepted theories; (5) smoothness?the ease with which a theory accounts for obser vational anomalies in terms of auxiliary hypotheses; (6) internal consistency-, (7) compatability with well-grounded metaphyscial beliefs) and (8) simplicity. These qualities allow for an adjudication between competing theo ries and hypotheses. Scientific advancement, therefore, need not simply be a question of new theories triumphing only through the death of old theoreticians, as Max Planck (1949) once argued, nor is there "no external objective basis for saying that any one theory, well argued and coherent internally and 'fitting' the data, is any bet ter than any other" (Hodder 1984:30). Nor, for that matter, need we</page><page sequence="12">68 David S. Whitley naively assume that confirmation or falsification through a singular critical test can occur. Instead, there are multiple criteria upon which scientific evaluation can be based, and these allow for a rational and objective process of verification, even if it is ultimately tentative and provisional in nature. Cognitive Archaeology There is, correspondingly, a rational approach available to us that can be called upon to obviate the many problems of positiv ism. However, this leaves some unresolved issues. As might be clear from the few illustrations I have cited concerning post-positivist philosophy of science, it is apparent that many processual archaeolo gists have, on a practical level, already adopted certain of the pos tulates of this move beyond positivism. This simply underscores Laudan's (1981:2) contention that the philosophy of science is more closely tied to what has already happened in the sciences than the reverse. But what, then, are the distinctions between cognitive ar chaeology and the archaeology practiced by many processual archae ologists, if these archaeologists already share some of the same realist rationalist commitments? In summarizing these I emphasize a distinctive brand of post-processual archaeology?cognitive ar chaeology?most evident in the research of the archaeologists at the University of the Witwatersrand. Fundamentally, cognitive archaeologists take the position that so cial inquiry must necessarily consider the cognitive and symbolic aspects of past societies. That is, fully aware of the shift from the behavioral to the cognitive doctrine, they maintain that the remains of prehistoric actions are evidential, and the point of inquiry is to study the cognitive systems behind the behavior creating the archae ological record. This does not deny that humans adapt to their envi ronment, or that man-land relationships may impose constraints on cultures. Further, it does not imply that such are unworthy of analy sis. And, parting company with post-processualists such as Hodder and Shanks and Tilly, it does not insist that archaeological research need be anti-scientific or that, somehow, concern with cognition im plies interest in emotions or psychological states (contrary to what both Sabloff et al. [1987] and Hodder [1986] seem to believe).</page><page sequence="13">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 69 Instead, while maintaining an allegiance to scientific method per se, and to the inherent rationality this implies, cognitive archaeolo gists insist that explanation and interpretation of prehistoric human societies and culture must look beyond the evidential level, past the behavior that created our archaeological record, to the cognitive sys tems that underlie it. In this avowedly anthropological approach to archaeology, three related issues, then, require clarification: the focus of social inquiry; the inescapability of interpretation in social research; and the means by which the cognitive systems of the past may be accessed. I discuss these in turn. The Focus of Social Inquiry Adopting a committment loosely related to Popper's "situational analysis" (Popper 1961, 1966, 1972, 1976),4 cognitive archaeologists maintain that the prehistoric past was socially and culturally consti tuted, and, therefore, that prehistoric societies and cultures cannot simply be reduced to one-to-one analogues with ecological or cyber netic metaphors. Nor, for that matter, do they think that the explana tion of the past can proceed simply with a consideration of the overt, behavioral realm or the relationship of humankind to the environ ment. Rather, they take the concept of culture to be central to ar chaeological analysis. But "culture" here is not what is meant by the term in traditional and new archaeology: culture as regulative rules, governed by mental templates, evidenced in behavioral patterns, and resulting from stimulus-response relationships with the environ ment. Instead, culture is defined as a system of beliefs, symbols, and values or, in a word, as worldview, with these "cognitive objects" comprising constitutive rules within which human action and be havior unfold. In this sense, culture is determinative for human so cial behavior, but this does not imply full predictability (Sapire n.d.; cf. Weber 1975:122-23); culture provides a system of beliefs that guides behavior, just like the rules for a game of chess, but culture does not fully prescribe behavior, like the algorithm that uniquely specifies the course of a computer program (cf. D'Agostino 1986). At this point a few words are needed in reference to Popper's situa tional analysis. In summary form, it has two components: a situa tional model, which is a description of what Popper terms the social environment within which human behavior occurs; and a rationality</page><page sequence="14">70 David S. Whitley principle. The latter (which is not to be taken as a law; while it is a major premise of the thesis, it is more rightly a definition, therefore it is not nomological; cf. Farr 1983:169) points to the need to recon struct the context or situation within which action occurs, to make the actions that result rationally understandable or appropriate to the context within which they unfold. By this is implied a ideologi cal analysis that begins with the definition of the situation and pro ceeds to the rationality of subsequent action, as specified by this context. Here the situational environment in a general way is recon cilable with the cognitive definition of culture, and interpretation therefore must consider the cognitive realm. Culture, then, is a central concern, but it is not simply an explana tory metaphor for the cognitive archaeologist (such as "diffusion" was for the traditional archaeologist, or "evolution" is in certain pro cessual studies). That is, it is the purpose of cognitive archaeological research to elucidate the system of beliefs that constitute a culture, thereby defining the cultural logic or situational rationality within which decisions were made, institutions were constituted, and ac tions performed. In reference to Popper's situational analysis, then, cognitive archaeology aims to identify the realm of "cognitive ob jects" and, through the exegesis of these, explain, interpret, and un derstand the prehistoric past. It is important to emphasize a few issues here. First, as noted above, concern with prehistoric cognition does not imply interest in mental states or other psychologistic concepts. It is, therefore, not the realm of human emotions, which has constituted the focus of "classical" hermeneutics and now seems the point of Hodder's con textual archaeology. Simply stated, understanding the past cannot be attained by "getting into" the psyche of our ancestors, or by con cern with the subjective experiences of prehistoric actors, or by re course to a sensationalist epistemology. As Farr (1983:161) notes, "the limitations of this subjective method overwhelm its utility and suggestiveness." In this manner cognitive archaeology parts ways with idealism and its recent post-processual manifestations. Second, explanation of the past (or of any social phenomena) can only be achieved by recourse to the cognitive realm. It cannot be attained simply by examination of behavior (Popper's "world-one") nor through consideration of human psychological motives and emo tions (Popper's "world-two"). Instead, explanation of social phenom ena requires recourse to understanding (cf. Weber 1977:109) and,</page><page sequence="15">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 71 unlike the doctrine espoused by more traditional positivists, causal, nomological explanation cannot be facilely substituted for this con cept, although it is not incompatible with such explanations (Farr 1983). The philosopher David Sapire has made this same argument in slightly different terms: If anthropology aims to render intelligible the actions, activities, and artifacts of people, culture can scarcely be viewed differently [than defined in terms of beliefs and values]. That's because of what actions are, and so, what it is to explain them or render them intelligible. The standard view is that actions depend on the beliefs and values of the agents who perform them. Divorce actions from these and you end up with something quite differ ent?bare behavior, bodily movement. Any grasp of actions must therefore be in terms of beliefs and values. . . . An under standing, Verstehen, of people's representations of, or models of the world or reality ... is [therefore] indispensible for an under standing of their actions. (Sapire n.d.) It is quite clear, consequently, that to come to terms with the past? be this in reference to some form of "explanation" or "interpreta tion"?understanding is required, something which positivist new archaeology originally denied (cf. Taylor 1971:10; more on this below). But understanding can only be predicated on a consideration of the cognitive realm, if archaeology is to be something more than a superficial prehistoric ethology. So whether we espouse explana tion and law-like generalizations or not, we are only fooling our selves if we think that the cognitive realm can be avoided. It is, there fore, to this area?the context-dependent world of beliefs and values or, in a word, to culture?that research must turn. Now this is bound to raise alarms among the profession. "We can't study the cognitive systems of the past," most will no doubt say, "because there are no living informants to tell us about them." Cer tainly, I do not contest the mortality of our subject matter. Instead, I rest the case for cognitive archaeology on two propositions. First, that even with no informants, aspects of prehistoric cognition can be resuscitated. This is an empirical and technical issue, which I turn to subsequently. Perhaps more to the point, however: if we deny the possibility of accessing prehistoric cognition, we not only deny cognitive archaeology but also fully negate the program of processual</page><page sequence="16">72 David S. Whitley archaeology. For example, as Evans-Pritchard noted long ago in com menting on Radcliffe-Brown's social anthropology, social structure is every bit as abstract as culture, or, at least, one is no more concrete than the other. Kinship, in other words?just like economic and sub sistence systems?is as much in people's minds as are beliefs and values (Sapire n.d.). All of these are at least in part cognitive con structs,- strictly, none are observable on the ground; therefore there is no logic to the argument that one can be accessed by prehistorians while the others cannot (Lewis-Williams 1986a; cf. Wylie 1982a). Nor, for that matter, is there reason to assume that the investigation of one need necessarily be methodologically different from the study of the other. Indeed, to presuppose that some of these phenomena can be identified and studied archaeologically while others cannot is sim ply to allow perceived inductive limits of the archaeological record to determine our research, as Wadley (1987) has rightly pointed out. But this is only part of the problem in positing a distinction in kind between culture and the social, economic, and subsistence sys tems of the new archaeologist. As Sapire (n.d.) contends, the analysis of social structure simply cannot be separated from beliefs and values: the relationships that constitute distinctions in social organi zation (like commoner and elite) lie exactly in culturally-specific values and beliefs. Therefore it cannot be presumed that one can be considered without the other. Sapire points out that "the prompts for these social roles [constituting social structure] are not in the genes; they are in the conceptions distilled from stories, theories, jokes, lies, customs, and other educative experiences since childhood . . . social structure presupposes culture" (Sapire n.d.; emphasis added). And, as Max Weber has argued in a frequently cited passage (1977:109), the same holds for economy as well. Consequently, con tentions that the processual archaeologists' focus of social inquiry is somehow more concrete, less abstract, and not part of the cognitive realm but, in fact, separable from it, are simply wrong-headed, and represent a logical fallacy of the gravest order. Archaeology and Interpretation That social structure, economy, and subsistence are as abstract a form of the cognitive realm as beliefs and values is one thing; that we need understanding to study them may be viewed by some as a slightly different matter. Traditional positivist natural science denied</page><page sequence="17">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 73 the need for Verstehen, or understanding, based on the argument that the objects that the physical sciences study ("stars," for example) have an existence independent of anything we make of them. With new archaeology's original adoption of positivism and its metaphysi cal belief in a unified science, moreover, it was presumed that archae ology could fully be a naturalistic science and that recourse to Verste hen was unnecessary. Further, it appears that certain archaeologists continue to view any concern with understanding or interpretation with suspicion. Therefore the interpretive nature of archaeology re quires comment. First, to allay certain initial fears, it is important to emphasize that there is nothing about interpretation that is inherently "less objec tive" or "more subjective," or "more scientific" or "less scientific," than there is about "explanation." To presume such is to commit a fallacy of equivocation in which the concepts "objective" and "sub jective" are conflated respectively with "unbiased" and "biased," "cognitive" and "noncognitive," "observational" and "nonobserva tional," "rational" and "irrational," and ultimately, "scientific" and "nonscientific." But this is simply an epistemological doctrine, yet to be supported. Processual archaeologists, for example, have never illustrated that their explanations are somehow more scientific or more objective than cognitive archaeologists' interpretations (cf. Feleppa 1981:62-63; Lewis-Williams 1983; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986). In a parallel vein, similarly, Rudner has noted that "no one has ever demonstrated that the psychological, per se, is iden tical with the biased; nor is it easy to imagine how a cogent demon stration of this could possibly proceed. (The fact that metaphysical positions have assumed this position without demonstration is scarcely recommendation for its adoption)" (1966:74; emphasis in original). Indeed, Max Weber (1975:125) has argued that it is exactly because interpretations of human actions can situate such actions within their own frames of reference that such interpretations are inherently more rational than scientific explanations of individual natural events, which may simply constitute statistical predictions. Thus, at the outset it is clear that certain archaeologists' reactions against interpretation and understanding are emotional reactions, based on embedded metaphysical and epistemological beliefs that have been little thought-through or critically evaluated. Fundamen tally, there is little justification for the argument that understanding and interpretation are, somehow, less objective than explanation.</page><page sequence="18">74 David S. Whitley But this embedded reactionary position aside, there are other sub stantial arguments against the notion that archaeology can ignore understanding. According to Max Weber (1975), for example, the dis covery of "meaning" and "interpreting" are neither logically nor epistemologically different than the discovery of laws or causes in the natural world; fundamentally both rely on the use of hypotheses and "instruments of concept formation" (Huff 1981:469). For Weber, in fact, interpretation and understanding are necessary activities in all domains of scientific inquiry (Huff 1982:91). Similarly, Popper argues that all science is performed within a "horizon of expecta tions" and that this "confers meaning on our experiences, actions and observations" (1972:345). By this, both contend that understand ing is a necessary, indeed unavoidable, component of research. And, on an empirical level at least, Knorr-Cetina (1981) has demonstrated that the situational logic of the physical sciences results in natural and technological scientists employing understanding and interpre tation as much as, and in the same manner as, social scientists. In short, not only is it impossible for the archaeologist to avoid under standing in studying the past, it is highly unlikely that the natural scientist is any more privileged in this regard as well. Again, however, this is not to imply that interpretation or under standing can be reduced epistemologically to "experiencing some thing" (Weber 1975:159). Weber was careful to emphasize the need to objectify interpretation (cf. Cooper 1981:82; Huff 1981, 1982), and this concern has been considered in detail by Popper. In fact, Popper's "critical rationality" is effectively an objective theory of understand ing (cf. Popper 1972). With this Popper defines what he calls "scien tific understanding," which is a "systematically critical version of the kind of understanding we have in everyday life" (Farr 1983:159). It is through situational analysis, in fact, that such objective under standing can be achieved. That is, for the archaeologist it can be through the related approach termed cognitive archaeology that we can understand and interpret the past, but in a manner that obviates the relativism of other post-processualist approaches. But there is one final subtlety in the interpretation of "understand ing" itself that warrants mention. This pertains directly to many processual archaeologists' apparent fear of the interpretive, and is that, since Verstehen is not a method of acquiring knowledge (as Binford [1987] seems to imply), it cannot be a suspicious method at all. Instead, it is a mode of knowledge (Sapire n.d.), and exactly that</page><page sequence="19">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 75 mode of knowledge appropriate when concern lies with values, be liefs, meanings, and so on. And this, of course, is the specific kind of knowledge required to understand human actions and behavior. Archaeology, consequently, is fundamentally an interpretive exer cise. Simply put, we interpret the past, regardless of whether or not we do so with explanatory laws, symbolic interpretations, or em pathie understanding. This does not necessarily relegate it to non science, nor does it implicate relativism. Instead, as Max Weber, Karl Popper, and others have taken pains to show, it can include rational, scientific study. Accessing the Cognitive Systems of the Past "Well and good," I'm sure some will say, "but how does he figure he can determine what they were thinking in the past?" This, then, is the next order of business, and, although my concern is not the thought patterns of prehistory, it ultimately reduces to empirical and technical problems. To begin, it is necessary to identify the ar chaeological locus of the cognitive realm. Where, in short, can we look within the archaeological record to find evidence of prehistoric cognitive systems? As implied above, prehistoric culture, which is to say beliefs, val ues, or worldview, is inseparable from other cognitive abstractions, such as economy, subsistence, and social organization. Huffman (1981, 1984, 1986a), for example, has shown how beliefs and world view were expressed symbolically in the internal arrangements of African Iron Age settlements, while Evers (1989) has illustrated the expression of contrasting cognitive systems in the material culture of a variety of modern and prehistoric Bantu groups. It follows, then, that cognitive systems are expressed at some level in effectively all aspects of material culture. Thus, beliefs are visible archaeologically, and they are even commonly and regularly expressed in everyday material culture (cf. Welbourn 1984:23) as well as in "ceremonial objects." That the cognitive side of the archaeological record has been somewhat overlooked in favor of techno-environmental considera tions, and that archaeologists may be unaccustomed to looking for it, then, is no argument in support of the putative difficulty of access ing prehistoric cognitive systems in the material record of the past. This fact, however, is bound to lead to other objections. For exam ple, on many occassions I have heard incredulity expressed over the</page><page sequence="20">76 David S. Whitley idea that beliefs and values can be ascertained without talking to informants. But this simply represents misconceptions concerning the nature of anthropological research, in a specific sense, and, more generally, concerning how interpretations are made, as well as the distinction between "signs" and "symbols" (Whitley n.d.a). As far back as his writings on the Andaman Islanders, Radcliffe-Brown (1922) argued that "native explanations" are not explanations at all in the sense of final exegesis or interpretation. Instead, as has been emphasized by numerous anthropologists (e.g., Sperber 1975; Hugh Jones 1979), such oral accounts themselves are simply the raw data from which the anthropologist develops his own interpretation of a particular culture. Ask a "native" why a particular ritual is per formed, or what bearing his worldview has on his architecture, and chances are quite good that the response will be on the order of "Be cause we have always done it this way," or "It is our tradition," or simply "I don't know." For that matter, ask the man on the street similar questions about the symbols and beliefs of our own culture and the average response will probably be equally unenlightening. Beliefs and values, as expressed in symbols, myths, and rituals, often not only are not widely understood within a culture but are fre quently misunderstood (Jung 1949:601; Grimes 1976:45; Elster 1982). In a word, then, oral informants are not the end-all and do-all of cognitive research, be it in anthropology or archaeology. It is exactly for this reason that Clifford Geertz argues that "whatever, or wherever, symbol systems 'in their own terms' may be, we gain em pirical access to them by inspecting events, not by arranging abstracted entities into unified patterns" (1973:17). And the archaeo logical record, of course, provides similar access to prehistoric be havioral events. The point, then, is that informants' comments constitute only part of the data in the interpretive process followed by ethnographers. While they may serve as the source of interpretive hypotheses, behav ior and action can be as important in explaining cognitive systems as are commentaries, and behavior and action are revealed archaeologi cally. This, however, is not to deny the value of ethnographic exege sis. This can be useful, but it is most useful in conjunction with behavioral evidence. It is for this reason that most (but not all) recent cognitive and post-processual studies have been tied to ethnographic records. Earle and Preucel (1987) note this and from it question whether such studies can, in fact, actually consider truly prehistoric</page><page sequence="21">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 77 cases. But in this they miss a central point. This is that cognitive ar chaeologists recognize that sound interpretations are fundamentally based on ethnographic analogy, and therefore that, in a substantive sense, the cognitive archaeology program is predicated on initially building a series of ethnographically informed analogical models. Thus, as Max Weber has noted, "It is not the exception, but the rule, that interpretation proceeds by analogy" (1975:162). And, perhaps closer to home, Alison Wylie has stated that "most archaeo logical inference remains analogical" (1985:64; cf. Kelley and Hanen 1988:261). It follows that one appropriate course in the development of a cognitive archaeological research program is to begin by building an ethnographically informed analogical base and, only once this is well established, to proceed to less immediate areas of the past. But it does not follow that such areas are methodologically inaccessible, as Earle and Preucel seem to imply. Instead, cognitive archaeology has begun with what can be considered "source-side" research, using ethnographic interpretations and, in an effort to develop relations of relevance, seeks to identify causal relationships or relations of dependence between pertinent variables. Once a methodologically sound analogy has been constructed, the prehistoric past can be truly accessed. One other point, emphasized by Wylie (cf. 1982b, 1985, 1988) in her detailed consideration of the archaeological use of analogy, is critical here. This is that sound analogical inference is best based on multiple sources; there is no support for the presumption that there need be a one-to-one analogue between source and subject (1985:106). She states: Analogical inference should not lead automatically to "ethno graphic despair" when no single, complete analog for the subject is available. Sophisticated analogical argument across the sci ences exploits a range of sources... and establishes the relevance of these sources to the subject by demonstrating the existence of "determining structures" . . . that ensure, with some specifia ble degree of reliability, that the association of compared with imputed attributes is not purely accidental. (Wylie 1988:231) Correspondingly, prehistoric cases which may have no exact equiva lence in the ethnographic record (such as early hominid behavior, or Upper Pleistocene societies) may, in fact, be approachable and inter pretable in light of well-founded analogical inference.</page><page sequence="22">78 David S. Whitley Are prehistoric cognitive systems accessible in this same way? I will sketch an example below to show that they are, but I would like to first gainsay one other (usually) tacit assumption, held by many archaeologists, that serves as a presuppositional stumbling block whenever the issue of the cognitive systems of the past is raised. This assumption has been implicitly expressed in reference to the parietal art of Mud Glyph Cave: It cannot be emphasized too strongly that it would be a serious mistake to attempt to "interpret" these themes and motifs in terms of Southeastern myth and religion as they were in the Historic period.. . . The glyphs were drawn more than 200 years earlier than our earliest, fragmentary historic records on the re gion. . . . The time and social change is roughly the same as the time between the American Revolution and World War II! (M?l ler 1986:38) My contention here is with the logic by which it is assumed that, since 200 years have passed, change has necessarily occurred, as if time itself was the cause of change. This, in other words, is a gradual ist doctrine that mistakenly confuses the fact that because change occurs over time, time is somehow causally implicated in change. Change, however, is a condition to be demonstrated empirically, not assumed a priori (Huffman 1986a:85; cf. Lewis-Williams 1984). In the case of Mud Glyph Cave and southeastern North America, per haps sufficient cultural change had unfolded to negate the value of historical records; but this needs be shown rather than assumed. This is especially true in light of the realization by many anthropolo gists that, even in the face of acculturation and social disruption, cognitive systems of belief, values, and ritual tend to be the most conservative and the most resistant to alteration. Indeed, it is exactly because of such conservatism that the verbal components of cere mony and ritual are widely expressed in archaic forms of language (Bloch 1974:62). Cognitive Archaeology in Practice There is, correspondingly, a philosophical, methodologi cal, and technical base upon which we can build an approach to studying prehistoric cognitive systems. Still, the above discussion</page><page sequence="23">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 79 does not exhaust the potentialities ?or resolve all the problems) that confront the cognitive archaeologist. Nonetheless, programmatics without practice is thin stuff. Rather than continue the theoretical discourse here, I conclude with brief synopses of two cognitive re search programs: one that demonstrates that the cognitive systems of the very distant past can be analyzed; and one that shows that understanding systems of cognition can aid the prehistorian in un derstanding more "traditional" archaeological domains, such as set tlement and subsistence. Shamanism and the Upper Paleolithic Art of Western Europe The first cognitive archaeological research program I briefly synthe size is that conducted by David Lewis-Williams and his students. This program had its beginnings in an ethnographically informed interpretation of the symbolic meaning of southern San rock paint ings (see Lewis-Williams 1980,1981,1982,1983, etc.; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1989). More recently, it has been extended well beyond the confines of southern Africa and the recent past. Lewis-Williams's research began with an effort to decipher the meanings of historic/protohistoric San rock paintings by combining an analysis of available ethnographic information on myth, ritual, and linguistics with the archaeological record of painted art. Roughly following Victor Turner's (e.g., 1967) suggestions for symbolic analy sis (Lewis-Williams 1981), he established that the painted motifs re ferred to the supernatural visions and experiences that medicine men received while in trance. Importantly, he also demonstrated the scientific reliability of his interpretation and, in fact, its superiority over competing hypotheses (Lewis-Williams 1982, 1983, 1985; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986). Recognizing the implications suggested by the origin of the painted forms in shamans' "hallucinatory" trance-states, he then began an investigation of the neuropsychological effects of altered states of consciousness on visual and graphic imagery (Lewis-Williams 1986b). This investigation was based on the major premise that the human neurological system is a biophysiological universal; that is, that the neuropsychological effects of altered states can be presumed equivalent cross-culturally and through the antiquity of Homo sa piens sapiens' occupation of the earth. In fact, an examination of</page><page sequence="24">80 David S. Whitley published neuropsychology experiments that have examined altered states of consciousness in Western laboratory subjects, as well as certain ethnographic studies of the same phenomena (e.g., Reichel Dolmatoff 1978), support this contention (Lewis-Williams and Dow son 1988). Building from these analogical sources, Lewis-Williams and Dow son (1988) then abstracted a series of recurring, fundamental visual forms ("entoptic phenomena") experienced cross-culturally during altered states, along with a set of principles of perception by which these are seen, and the stages through which a trance subject's visual hallucination proceeds. This neuropsychological model was then tested against two separate corpora of rock art, both of which are known to have been painted by shamans and to be related to their altered states experiences: the San case (Lewis-Williams 1980, 1981, 1982, etc.), and the rock art of the Coso Range of the western Great Basin of North America (Whitley 1988b, 1992, n.d.a, n.d.b). Based on a close correspondence between the expectations of the neuro psychological model and the San and Coso arts, confidence in the inferential value of this analogical model in interpreting prehistoric corpora of art was obtained. Lewis-Williams and Dowson then compared the expectations of their analogically based neuropsychological model with the rock art of the European Upper Paleolithic. A close correspondence was found between the so-called geometric "signs" of the Upper Paleolithic and their seven recurring entoptic forms. In addition, correspondence be tween the model and the Paleolithic art in terms of the principles of perception and the compositional style and graphic logic by which the geometric forms were combined with iconic images, and the iconic images themselves were rendered, was also revealed. From this, they inferred a shamanic origin, founded in altered states of consciousness, for this corpora of cave art. With this inference they opened the door to the cognitive/belief systems of Upper Paleolithic culture. A few points are important to emphasize in reference to this study. First, while it is true that others had earlier suggested a shamanistic hypothesis to explain Franco-Cantabrian art, Lewis-Williams and Dowson's study for the first time based this inference on a methodo logically sound analysis. This was done, second, by an application of just the sort of analogical model building suggested by Wylie (e.g., 1985); that is, through the use of multiple sources examined to iden</page><page sequence="25">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 81 tify relations of relevance or determining structures and applied to a case that has no known parallel in our ethnographic record. Third, of course, this demonstrates the feasibility of cognitive analyses of the past entirely divorced from written records and texts. But, perhaps equally importantly, they undertook their analysis and interpreta tion of this art corpus in a manner by which their hypothesis and its competitors could be rationally adjudicated. Specifically, hypotheses such as "art-for-art's sake," "hunting magic," and so on, can be com pared to it in terms of the criteria listed earlier (cf. Lewis-Williams 1983; Lewis-Williams and Loubser 1986), allowing for an inference to the best hypothesis. It is demonstrably clear, then, that there are no inductive limits placed on cognitive archaeological studies by the nature of our pre historic data. Further, it is important to emphasize that Lewis-Wil liams and Dowson's study is simply the first step into the examina tion of the cognitive realm of the European Upper Paleolithic. In this sense it is important to recognize that its importance, and its full significance, will only be realized after its implications are drawn out in subsequent research. Thus, the inference that the art was pro duced by shamans and was painted to display images seen in altered states is not the conclusion for this line of analysis, but simply the starting point from which a whole series of other problems can be addressed (cf. Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988:217). Art and Ideology in the Western Great Basin A second program of study that I wish to quickly summarize is my own research in the Coso Range of eastern California. This has in volved about ten years of intermittent site survey and four years of intensive and test excavations (cf. Whitley and Gumerman 1986; Whitley et al. 1986; Whitley et al. 1988). These have been combined with Chronometrie (Whitley and Dorn 1987, 1988) and interpretive analyses of rock art (Whitley 1982, 1987, 1988b, 1990, n.d.a, n.d.b) as well as secondary ethnographic studies (Whitley 1992). The Coso investigation, I believe, demonstrates the potential articulation and importance of cognitive studies for understanding mainstream ar chaeological concerns, such as subsistence, settlement systems, and man-land relationships. Settlement surveys, previously published excavation reports (e.g., Harrington 1957; Lanning 1963), and my own projects suggest that a</page><page sequence="26">82 David S. Whitley 3,000 to 4,000 year period of stability existed in the Coso Range, with only minimal change (if any) in settlement patterns and subsis tence practices in this region. That is, between 3,000 and 4,000 radiocarbon years b.p., a settlement and subsistence pattern had been established in the Coso Range and environs, and this did not appreciably change until the arrival of Euro-Americans during the middle of the last century: village/aggregation sites, occupied during the winter, were placed in the valley bottoms toward the western side of the range, and a variety of smaller habitation and exploitation loci was established in essentially all the surrounding upland and lowland environments (cf. Elston et al. 1983; Whitley et al. 1988). In addition, based on inferences concerning site/environment correla tions as well as direct evidence of food remains (Gumerman 1985; Whitley et al. 1988; Moore n.d.), a generalized foraging pattern was followed that emphasized locally available plant resources and small game and minimized the importance of big game hunting. Perhaps most importantly, it has not been possible to infer that any conse quential shift in this pattern, either in terms of foods exploited or food-getting strategies employed, occurred over this same period.5 This pattern is in distinct contrast to circumstances in the imme diately surrounding areas of the western Great Basin (cf. Bettinger 1977, 1989), where significant change has been identified. Also nota ble, in reference to external comparisons, are the very high density and quantity of petroglyphs found in the Cosos. These are estimated to number more than 100,000 individual motifs, and are found liter ally on any basalt outcrop offering a homogeneous lithic panel for pecking. Engravings of bighorn sheep [Ovis canadensis) predominate numerically and visually, but ornately rendered, "patterned-body" anthropomorphic figures are also common, as are "stick-figure" hu mans and geometric motifs of myriad forms. Although slightly over stating the case, Wellman (1979:61) notes that "the rock art in the Coso Range . . . appears to have developed and flourished in almost complete isolation"; that is, it differs in scale, in some ways in con tent, and in certain cases in socio-religious setting, from the rock art of the immediately surrounding regions (Whitley 1987). This record of stability implies a series of problems, at least in reference to techno-environmental explanations of cultural stability and change. First, there is evidence of environmental change in this region over the period in question (Weide 1982:17; Scuderi 1984). This involved a cyclical series of neo-glacial events which, among</page><page sequence="27">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 83 other things, filled and subsequently drained major surrounding lake systems, with the last significant lake stand having occurred approx imately 1,000 years b.p. (Sutton 1990). Although it is not yet clear how greatly this affected the local environment, certainly some de gree of environmental variability was experienced over this three to four thousand year period, involving mean temperature fluctuations, shifts in water tables, evapo-transpiration rates, mean annual pre cipitation, and moisture budgets, and this variability can be pre sumed to have had some effect on faunal and floral resources. Second, it is also clear that (at least minor) technological change was experienced by the inhabitants of the Coso Range. This involved the introduction of the bow and arrow (replacing the atlatl and spear), sometime around a.d. 600. With this technological change as well, certain shifts occurred in the exploitation of local obsidian sources: obsidian quarrying moved from the use of lag deposits to (literally) the mining of major rhyolitic-obsidian flows. But even with the technological change in hunting equipment and shift in obsidian procurement strategies, there is no evidence of any transi tion in trading patterns (Allen 1986) or, for that matter, correlated evidence of changes in settlement or subsistence. Thus, the implication that results is that, even in the face of some environmental and technological change, the archaeological record of the Coso Range is one marked by stability. Recourse simply to environmental adaptation or technological and evolutionary posi tions to explain this archaeological record, then, falls short: the set tlement pattern, subsistence system, and, for that matter, the gen eral artifact inventory, did not change appreciably even while other variables altered and, further, did not change even though the imme diately adjacent Owens Valley area underwent substantial trans formation (cf. Bettinger 1977, 1989). In this circumstance, then, the record of stability requires explanation (at least in terms of proces sual archaeology's presuppositions), and this apparently can only be sought outside the bounds of techno-environmental considerations. How, then, do we understand the prehistory of the Coso Range? My position has rested on a number of premises, the first of which is that, while subsistence and settlement reflect necessary adaptations to the environment, the environment (and, for that matter, relevant technology) is a contingent rather than causal variable; that is, they are limiting but in no simple sense determinate factors. Thus, it is to the social and cultural systems that explanation must turn if we</page><page sequence="28">84 David S. Whitley are to understand the three to four thousand years of cultural stabil ity in this region. And by culture, of course, I imply the situational context, or prehistoric system of beliefs and values, that gave ration ality to the social and technological systems and that maintained these even when confronted with a changing environment and tech nological base. Second, I emphasize that change is a condition to be demonstrated empirically, not to be presupposed in gradualist terms. With this, I accept the possibility that the ethnohistoric record can inform an interpretation?indeed, be used to develop a model of the cultural and social systems of the Coso Range?fully applicable to this lengthy period of prehistory. That is, since I argue that there is no empirical evidence of significant change, and historical linguistic studies suggest ethnolinguistic continuity in the region (cf. Fowler 1972), I see no logic in the assumption that there, somehow, must have then been some anyway, and that ethnographic interpretation is thereby disallowed. My argument then proceeds on two fronts. First, explicitly consid ering the social theory underlying this analysis, I employ existing ethnohistoric and ethnographic records to develop a model of the social relations of production that were ethnographically (and there fore presumably prehistorically) present in the Great Basin. These can be said to have been comprised by the kinship system, the sexual division of labor, and the shamanistic religious system. Following Collier's (1988) analysis of kinship among the closely related Coman ches, I argue that a series of inequalities were, in fact, present among the putatively egalitarian Coso Shoshone. These were manifest in male : female, married male : unmarried male, and shaman : non shaman groups within society, and resulted in structural inequali ties in terms of the distribution of obligations, opportunities, and prestige as well as of the maintenance of power in society (Whitley 1990, n.d.b). In this instance inequality needs to be considered not only in terms of the rights and privileges maintained by different members of a society, but also in terms of the obligations that bur dened them and the opportunities they were afforded or denied. Even while Coso society was kin-based, unranked, and lacking in leaders with the right to give orders to others, gender, marriage, and the access to shamanistic power resulted in an unequal distribution of privileges, powers, and obligations. The best example of this con cerns gender-based subsistence practices: men hunted big game (deer and mountain sheep) while women and children were principally</page><page sequence="29">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 85 responsible for gathering plant foods and foraging for small game (lagomorphs and rodents), which provided the bulk of the aborigi nal diet. However, the game the men brought back was distributed throughout the camp, whereas the women's contributions were re served for their families. Everyone, in other words, was guaranteed some share in large game, so in a strict sense it did not matter whether a man hunted or not; he and his family would get meat regardless, but they would only get the staples of their diet, plant foods, if the wife was diligent in gathering. Because of differences in the manner in which the plant foods gathered by women and the game hunted by men were distributed, therefore, women were effec tively independent in an economic sense, whereas men could only adequately get by either through incurring debts to married men, or by marriage itself. As a result, once married, men were relieved of obligations, whereas women were tied to them (Whitley 1990). Mar riage, in this sense, was the key to a male's economic well-being, but the same did not necessarily hold for females. Further, it was only with marriage that men could become politi cal actors and acquire prestige. Women, regardless of marital status, had little or no means of acquiring prestige and (implicit but none theless important) political power. For even while no true chiefs existed, it would be a mistake to therefore presume that leadership was lacking; that is, influence and authority certainly were present, and were evident in older, married males. Authority, prestige, and power, then, were effectively restricted to the males in Coso society, and were acquired in part through the economic status acquired by the male with marriage. In this sense women were not necessarily viewed as inferior to men, nor were they down-trodden by them, but the fact remains that the women's obligations were greater, and their opportunities fewer, than those of the men. But rather than recognizing the importance of marriage in struc turing relationships between men and women and especially be tween men and other men, particularly in giving men an economic independence (from other men) they otherwise would not achieve and in allowing them to become political actors, cultural logic dis torted causality. It was believed that marital success resulted from hunting success, and hunting success was due to shamanistic super natural power. A man was a great hunter, in other words, because of his supernatural power, and he had a successful marriage(s) because of his hunting capabilities, not because he had a steady hand with</page><page sequence="30">86 David S. Whitley the bow or because he had a devoted and hardworking wife. Shaman istic power, in this sense, held the key not only to hunting achieve ments but in turn to marital success and ultimately to the acquisi tion of privilege and prestige. In short, it was this complex system of social relations of production that socially constituted Coso society. Perhaps more importantly, these social relations maintained Coso society even in the face of changing environment and modifications in technology, and these social relations were inherently nonegalita rian. Yet one wonders how this system of inequality was maintained and supported, especially in light of the changing environment noted for this region and time period. Given the basic inequalities in this hunter-gatherer society, it is necessary to sketch the system of beliefs supporting these social rela tions. Following Keesing (1987), I argue that culture, the cognitive system of beliefs and values, is expressed by an ideological system that masks and mystifies true relations of production to make them appear "natural" and "pre-ordained" (cf. Elster 1982) and, through this, enables the reproduction of a society founded on fundamental inequities. This ideological system of beliefs and values is revealed through a symbolic analysis of myths and ritual, in conjunction with a consideration of the archaeological record of petroglyphs found in the Coso Range. That is, the second thrust of my argument concerns the nature of the belief system present ethnographically and presum ably prehistorically, and its archaeological manifestation in the his toric and prehistoric (cf. Whitley and Dorn 1987, 1988) rock art of the region (Whitley 1982, 1992, n.d.b). Ethnographic evidence indicates that this art was made by sha mans, that it was related to their acquisition of supernatural power, and that it depicts the hallucinations they perceived in the altered states of consciousness they entered to access the supernatural world. The content of this art is notable on two accounts: it is exclu sively male in referent, and it emphasizes, symbolically, "hunting." Of course, it is exactly for these reasons that early, inductive in terpretations of the art attributed it to a vaguely conceived "hunting cult," founded on an even vaguer notion of "hunting magic" (Whit ley 1982, n.d.a). Still, it is here that the clues to its ideological mean ing lie. That is, at an overt level the Coso engravings glorify the importance of males' big game hunting, even though such was appar ently of minimal subsistence significance in the region (Whitley and</page><page sequence="31">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 87 Gumerman 1986), and they do this by emphasizing the importance of the shamans' symbolic and ritual involvement in this activity. As a manifestation of the ideological system, the Coso rock engrav ings, then, were intended to aid in the misrepresentation of the im portance of male hunting in Coso society, and of the shamans' part in hunting, in terms of the supernatural balance of the world. Hunt ing success was considered the cause of marital success, and it was only through successful marriage that males had access to power and prestige. But hunting success could only be achieved with super natural power and balance, facilitated by the ritual activities of the shamans. Shamans' control of supernatural power correspondingly gave them control over hunting and therefore over marriage. And with this, the engravings helped to mystify the unequal and asymet rical relationships both between the sexes and between shamans and nonshamans by valorizing and glorifying the shamans' and the males' contribution to material subsistence. This contribution was made to appear important, even when it was inconsequential, and its valori zation legitimized an unequal order of things, as if this was the only way things could be. Thus it was because of the symbolic mystifica tion suggested by the Coso petroglyphs, as well as by other aspects of myth and ritual, that the potential conflicts between male-female and shaman-nonshaman special interest groups were obviated in pre historic Coso society. With this, of course, the society was able to continue to exist and maintain the status quo, perpetuating an adap tation to the environment based on nonegalitarian social relations of production, even when external changes and stimuli may have made this system less than optimal or (in Western terms) rational and equitable. It is through recourse to an ethnographically informed interpreta tion of Coso society and its rock engravings, consequently, that I derive my understanding of the last three to four thousand years of prehistory in the Coso region. In so doing I have not denied the im portance of identifying human-environment relationships, or of the significance of technology in prehistoric society. Instead, I have simply shifted the emphasis of understanding away from such con cerns toward the cognitive realm and have emphasized ideological beliefs and values?culture and its situational logic?in interpreting the prehistoric past. In this, therefore, I argue for an anthropologi cal archaeology, one based on prevalent modern interpretations of</page><page sequence="32">88 David S. Whitley what anthropology is and what it can and should do, and how its central concern, culture, should be defined, instead of a reduction of anthropology to narrow concerns with adaptation, technology, and environment. The Baby and the Bathwater In concluding this essay one metaphor comes to mind that, perhaps, best summarizes my central theme. It is a familiar one, and, in its terms, it seems that both new archaeologists and certain post-processualists are guilty of ablutionary excess. For al though new archaeologists were correct in their quest for scientific method and rigor, this quest did not fully justify their jettison of the cultural bathwater, within which prehistoric societies adapted, evolved, and in some instances changed. And, while right in recog nizing archaeology's inherently hermeneutic side, certain post-pro cessualists have ejected the scientific baby, which continues to pro vide the only basis for a plausible interpretation of the past. But rejection or acceptance of either of these commitments need not be globally based, as many new archaeologists and post-proces sualists suppose: there is no contradiction in an archaeology that incorporates scientific method and heuristic even while maintaining allegiance to interpretation and understanding. Cognitive archaeol ogy, while certainly no panacea to all the theoretical and methodo logical problems our discipline continues to face, reconciles this false distinction and revitalizes a concern that should be central to an anthropological archaeology: the study and explanation of prehis toric cultures. Acknowledgments Research in the Coso Range was conducted principally while I was at the UCLA Institute of Archaeology. I owe many people thanks for their assistance with my investigations there; unfortu nately, space allows me to single out only Wolf Gumerman, Joe Simon, Bob Moore, Rod Kingry, Gwen Harwood and the Rodney Lane family. The draft of this essay was prepared while I held a post doctoral research fellowship with the Rock Art Research Unit in the</page><page sequence="33">Prehistory and Post-Positivist Science 89 Archaeology Department at the University of the Witwatersrand. I am indebted to the Unit, the Department and the University for their support. I am also greatly indebted to the comments and suggestions of my colleague in the philosophy department, David Sapire, during the preparation of this paper. I thank Tom Huffman, David Lewis Williams, Lyn Wadley, and Tamy Whitley for their help and com ments. Although I have attempted to develop a normative characteri zation of the research of various cognitive archaeologists I have had the pleasure to work alongside, it is important to emphasize that the opinions expressed here are, of course, solely my own. NOTES 1. Obviously, not all anthropologists adopted this change (cf. Keesing 1974). Those most concerned with cultural ecology and economic anthropol ogy?notably, those closest to most new archaeologists' interests?often maintain a behaviorist perspective, even in light of persuasive philosophical attacks such as those offered by Harr? and Secord ( 1972; cf. Kelley and Hanen 1988:202-4). But, that a very large proportion, if not the majority of the discipline, accepted this change in culture theory seems undeniable. 2. Indeed, it is probably true that many processual archaeologists have implicitly adopted many of the tenets of post-positivism. In part this results because its intellectual roots lie in the writings of philosophers of science working in the 1950s and 1960s (including Kuhn and Hempel) who were, themselves, widely read by archaeologists. 3. Kelley and Hanen (1988) have correctly pointed out that even while realism has gained many followers in recent years (e.g., Wylie 1981; Gibbon 1984), it is not the only potentially viable alternative to positivism, and I do not mean to imply such by my emphasis on it. Instead, and at the risk of oversimplifying their position, Kelley and Hanen contend that a sophisti cated anti-realism may serve archaeologists better than realism, especially in that it requires no hard-line metaphysical commitment to a belief in truth, or the reality of the unobservable. But the latter?the reality of unob servable entities?seems no obstacle for the cognitive paradigm. And the notion that observation is theory-dependent, which is tacit in anti-realism (Kelley and Hanen 1988:271), seems a significant stumbling block. Be this as it may, they also note that an insistence on realism may be a red-herring because "from the point of view of accomplishing the scientific tasks at hand, it makes no difference whether one is a realist or [an anti-realist]" (Kelley and Hanen 1988:216). 4. I stress here the importance of Karl Popper's hermeneu tics (cf. Farr</page><page sequence="34">90 David S. Whitley 1983) and the similarity of his perceptions on this topic to cognitive archae ology. This will come as a surprise to many archaeologists, who apparently have not read beyond some of his earlier works and presume him to be a "positivist" (in the very general sense) par excellance, and therefore to have supported a position antithetical to hermeneutics, understanding, and interpretation. A narrow focus on Popper's positivism and falsificationist program, in fact, has been a common characteristic of contemporary social scientists (Farr 1983:157). But, as Popper himself notes, his concern with situational analysis was the "much more important aspect of the problem" (1976:42, 117). And, while I fear the necessary brevity here does not do it justice, a reading of his thesis of hermeneutics does much to support the notion and importance of a scientifically based, rational, interpretive archae ology: in short, cognitive archaeology. In this, Popper's position is similar to that espoused by Max Weber. It is also important to note that Popper's hermeneutics may have been given short shrift by those who might benefit most from it because of his perceived ideological stance (particularly as expressed in The Poverty of His toricism and The Open Society and its Enemies). Certainly, the adoption of aspects of his philosophical and methodological positions affirms no com mitment to his ideological ones, and it is unfortunate when political differ ences serve to preclude intellectual discourse. For, as Alexander (1981:281) has noted, "social science is inherently ideological, but it is not only so." 5. In an interim report (Whitley et al. 1988), it was suggested that a change may have occurred at the break between the Late Prehistoric and Shosho nean periods, or at about a.d. 1200-1300. Subsequent reconsideration of the evidence, as well as additional data (cf. Hildebrandt and Gilreath 1988), indicate that the contentions raised for change in this earlier paper were overstated.
