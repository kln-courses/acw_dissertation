<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brahmanical Imagery in the Kus?na Art of Mathura: Tradition and Innovations by Pran Gopal Paul and Debjani Paul At once a place of pilgrimage, a centre of trade and commerce, and a seat of political power, Mathur? was by no means the only city of its kind in ancient India. On the basis of the above criteria several other early historic sites may have claim to similar distinction ? R?jagrha and V?r?nasi are just two of them. But what made Mathur? pre-eminent among its peers, is the incomparable role it played as a major centre of religious art as well. Indeed no other ateliers are known to have produced at the same time so many images pertaining to all the three principal religious system of India: Brahmanism, Buddhism and Jainism. The unquestionable supremacy of the Mathur? sculptor, at least till the beginning of the Gupta period, is further documented by the discovery of his handiwork from far-flung points of the Indian subcontinent i1). To a great extent it is in the visual rendering of the various gods and goddesses of theistic Brahmanism that the Mathur? artist displayed his ingenuity and inventiveness at their best. Along with almost all the major cult icons ? Visnu, Siva, S?rya, Sakti and Ganapati:? a number of subsidiary deities of the faith were given tangible form (*) These pages are dedicated in memory of Prof. Dr Johanna Engelberta van Lohuizen-de Leeuw (25th October 1919-8th December 1983), one of the outstanding scholars of the History, Art, Epigraphy and Palaeography of Mathur?, 'the city of the gods'. 0 The extent of the dispersal of Brahmanical sculpture of the Mathur? school may be apparent from the geography of the findspots of just two examples. The first of these, a red sandstone relief depicting an episode from the life of Krsna, was found at an undisclosed site in Pakistan and is now in a private collection in that country. See J.E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, 'Gandh?ra and Mathura: Their Cultural Relationship', in P. Pal, ed., Aspects of Indian Art, Leiden 1972, p. 30, pi. XIa. The other is a standing figure of K?rttikeya in the same material. Unearthed at Mah?sth?n, Bangladesh, the sculpture is on display in the Asutosh Museum of Art, Calcutta. See S.K. Saraswati, Early Sculpture of Bengal, Calcutta 1936, repr. 1962, p. 12, fig. 3. Besides, we should not leave out of consideration those Kus?na Mathur? carvings that are now in various European and American museums or private collections; from the Ferenc Hopp Museum of Oriental Art in Budapest to the Avery Brundage assemblage in San Francisco. Since, understandably, these pieces are often without a record of their precise provenance, chances are that some of them may have actually been discovered at different locations in the subcontinent other than Mathur? itself or its immediate neighbourhood. [1] 111</page><page sequence="2">in Indian art here for the first time in an organized manner. In view of this and for the variety and multiplicity of devotional images then made, the history of Mathur? during the first three centuries of the Christian era, which coincided with the rule of the Kus?nas, can very well be called revolutionary in the development of Brahmanical sculpture. Several distinguished scholars have discussed in extenso different aspects of Brahmanical images in the early art of Mathur?. As a result of many substantial contributions in the past there is, at present, little that we can add to the existing stock of knowledge as far as the domain of iconography is concerned. In this study it will, instead, be our endeavour to understand rather the probable factors and the various stages of the process that led to the spurt of image making at the site during those eventful centuries. Antiquity of Image Worship Image worship, to be sure, did not commence with the coming of the Kus?nas in India. As has often been stated, the practice may be traced back to as early as the heyday of the Indus Valley Civilization; since some of the artifacts found at Mohenjodaro and Harappa, especially the small but quite impressive group of stone sculptures, cannot otherwise be easily explained (2). The period between that time and the arrival of Alexander the Great on the Indian scene more than a millenium later, however, is devoid of such evidence as would suggest that the practice continued the way it had been. From a perusal of Vedic literature one is rather inclined to believe that it did not. Whether or not they were responsible for the destruction of the Harappan city sites, the Aryan settlers introduced a radically different pattern of social and religious life into the land of their adoption. It is, basically, the spiritual outlook of the newcomers that seems to have had a tremendous impact on Indian life ever afterwards. As a matter of fact the rise of Buddhism and Jainism in the 6th century B.C. in Eastern India, beyond the pale of Aryandom, was a far-reaching reaction against centuries of all too powerful religio-philosophical influence of the Vedic Aryans. We should do well to remember that the Aryans worshipped purely the elementary (2) Sir Mortimer Wheeler, The Indus Civilization (Supplementary Volume to the Cambridge History of India), 3rd ed., Cambridge 1968, pp. 86-90 and, particularly, pi. XIX-C. As long as the anthropomorphic representation of some supernatural power is concerned, these are sufficient for our present quest ? no matter whatever name or names one may attach to them. Since we are not concerned here with the problem of 'Siva's origin in the Indus Civilization' in particular, we need not enter into the on-going controversy regarding the significance of the 'Pasupati Seal' from Mohenjodaro or of the intent and purpose of the ring-stones and cones (yoni and linga) from various Indus sites. For the latest trend in interpretation of these two categories of objects, see Doris Srinivasan, 'The So-Called Proto-Siva Seal from Mohenjo Daro: An Iconological Assessment', Archives of Asian Art, XXIX (1975-76), pp. 47-58; Id., 'Unhinging Siva from the Indus Civilization', JRAS, 1984, pp. 77-89. 112 [2]</page><page sequence="3">forces of nature by means of elaborate sacrifices, together with appropriate hymns. In this scheme of ritual it was not necessary, nor was it possible to substitute the object of exaltation so convincingly by any concrete form, least of all by human figure, without compromising the fundamental attitude of the worshipper to the all-pervasive power that was being propitiated. Such a change in the approach of the tightly-knit Vedic and even post-Vedic society, orchestrated as it was by orthodox priesthood, could not have come of itself. This was possible when such an urge was actually felt by the general masses and that feeling was intensified by the ideological impact of fresh ethnic influx into the Indian social pool. Before the coming of the Kus?nas there had been at least three post-Aryan major foreign invasions into India, by the Achaemenids, the Greeks, and the Scytho-Parthians. In all likelihood after the return of peace a considerable number of these people stayed on and gradually merged in the Indian masses. And a society that absorbs waves after waves of immigrants can hardly remain immune to some extraneous influence. Being of proven military strength and having well-established administrative institutions these people could not just be forgotten, even when they ceased to wield political power. Conceivably, a great number of them were accepted as Ksatriyas and Vaisyas, the two significant segments of the four-fold, traditional Indian social system. Whether as military aristocracy or as mercantile nobility these 'naturalized Indians' might not have followed so rigidly every prescription of the Brahmanical priestly books ? certainly not as much as their indigenous counterparts would have done. Although some of the early rulers of foreign extraction did adopt Indian names and proclaimed in their epigraphical and numismatic records devotion to one or other deities of the Brahmanical faith, hardly is one among them known to have performed any of the prescribed Vedic sacrifices, such as the Asvamedha. This is an important clue in our present quest inasmuch as it tends to suggest that adherence to a personal deity and in pursuance of that feeling, representing the deity in clearly perceptible visual form could have been preferred to the abstract Vedic concept of a divinity invoked through complex ritual sacrifices. It is not our intention to suggest that the convention of representing the gods and goddesses of the Brahmanical pantheon in anthropomorphic form owed its origin entirely to external initiative; for that would imply that the metaphysical intricacies of the Vedic religion were comprehensible to all classes of people and that every one was contented with symbol worship alone. It would be more realistic to think that the society as a whole regarded the visions of the Vedic seers with awe and respect. And yet some people, in accordance with their caste and class status, might have been inclined to attach themselves to such divine concepts as could be made manifest in concrete form and thereby rendered directly approachable by all and sundry. Once the trend gathered sufficient momentum, it was but natural for the theologians to come to terms with it and adopt a condescendingly indulgent view of image worship. What we have so far been trying to convey is, it may seem, no more than a conjecture. Irrespective of the degree of feasibility a conjecture will always remain [3] 113</page><page sequence="4">one, unless it is subjected to some searching questions and found to tally with available historical information. It is, hence, incumbent on us to take into account the literary, epigraphical and numismatic data and explore whether or not the theory conforms to archaeological and art historical findings. Literary Allusions That in the pre-Christian era there was some form of image worship among certain sections of the Indian populace cannot be ruled out in view of the literary evidence, both indigenous and foreign. Although alluded to there in a different context, from the Ast?dhy?yi of P?nini (c. 4th century B.C.) and the Mah?bh?sya of Patanjali {c. 2nd century B.C.) one gets the impression that images of Siva, Skanda, Vis?kha, V?sudeva and Arjuna were known in those times (3). Somewhat similar seem to be the testimonies of at least two foreign chroniclers. We owe to Quintus Curtius the interesting information that an image of Heracles/Hercules was carried in front of the Indian army of King Porus while he was marching against the advancing forces of Alexander the Great (4). Also from the account of Megasthenes, the Seleucid ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya at P?taliputra, we learn that Heracles commanded special veneration among the people of S?rasena country ? the region of Mathur?, that is (5). For lack of further elucidation in the original text it is difficult to know which of the Indian deities was taken for 'Heracles' in the sources just mentioned. Instead of Siva or Yaksa as suggested by Coomaraswamy, J.N. Banerjea believed Vasudeva Krsna to be the deity referred to here in Graeco-Roman terminology (6). This is a theory that deserves consideration since both for his role in the battle-field of Kuruksetra and close association with Mathur?, Vasudeva-Krsna fits more into the picture. At the same time, however, in this clear case of a mistaken identity, we cannot lightly discard another possibility, that is, K?rttikeya. As a god of war, Skanda K?rttikeya-Mah?sena was equally popular among the martial classes both in Madhyadesa and Gandh?ra. As far as archaeological remains are concerned, early images of this (3) This hypothesis is already advanced by various scholars of whom Banerjea has discussed the issue in some details, at least in three of his major publications. See J.N. Banerjea, The Development of Hindu Iconography (henceforth DHI), 2nd ed., Calcutta 1956, pp. 76 and 85; Id., Pancop?san? (in Bengali), Calcutta 1960, pp. 51-52; Id., Religion in Art and Archaeology (Vaishnavism and Saivism), Dr. R.K. Mookerji Endowment Lectures, University of Lucknow, 1961-62, Lucknow 1968, p. 3. (4) Cited in A.K. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art, London 1927, repr. New York 1965, p. 42, fn. 5. (5) The implication of this observation seems to have been first noted in R.G. Bhandarkar, Vaisnavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems, Strassburg 1913, repr. Varanasi 1965, p. 9. (6) Banerjea, Religion in Art and Archaeology, cit., pp. 3-4. 114 [4]</page><page sequence="5">deity certainly outnumber those of Vasudeva-Krsna or Visnu in the North-West (7). In any attempt to recognize K?rttikeya as the god taken for Heracles by the Macedonians, the apparent discrepancy of attribute in the hand (spear/lance/staff, instead of the club) may not be a serious obstacle. After all, the association of a specific weapon with a particular god or goddess is a later phenomenon in Indian iconography. This custom may not have been standardized in so early a period when, in all probability, image making was anything but a commonplace activity. Be that as it may, the point at issue is not so much the real identity of the deity as the question whether or not, by then, Brahmanical gods were being anthro pomorphically represented. It is true that no such icon has come down to us from a period earlier than the 2nd century B.C. But the nature of the literary data tends to suggest that a limited number of divinities might have been rendered in human form. It is quite unlikely that an abstract symbol or theriomorphic form, whatever was in front of the Indian army, would have been likened by the Macedonians to their Heracles. Our assumption that the image was probably that of K?rttikeya is based primarily on the contextual relevance of the deity to the occasion. The assumption may not be a far-fetched one if we further reflect that the incident signifies not so much the existence of a devotional cult as such; rather it pointedly indicates an effective (0 For at least four Gandh?ran Skanda images in schist, listed in one place, see van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, op. cit., p. 41, fns. 107-10. In contrast, despite her characteristically thorough look for likely evidence, the same scholar {loc. cit., fn. 98) came upon just one schist relief which can only possibly be a representation of Visnu. In view of relatively greater popularity of Skanda in Gandh?ra we may perhaps refer here to an interesting bronze from Afghanistan, now in the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, Rome. Published tentatively as a Lokap?la by M. Taddei (The Ancient Civilization of India, London 1970, colour pi. 143), the statuette is again reproduced with three illustrations by G. Verardi (EW, 27, 1977, pp. 279-80, figs. 6-8), to whom it seemed to be a royal figure. The posture of the hands and the halo behind the head are indications of its being either a lance-bearing Lokap?la or an imposing ruler. If, however, the flaring skirt-like apparel is not acutally the lower part of a tight-fitting long coat, and the intersecting lines on the back are the remnant of a channavira or some such trapping, the bare-footed, moustached but beardless figure with bare torso can as well be that of Skanda-Kum?ra. Since the effigy is shown to have hanging locks of hair (still preserved on the left side of the head), rather than the Sasanian type of laterally fluttering ribbons, our assumption that it might be an image of Skanda trisikhin deserves consideration in future attempts to arrive at a proper identification of the bronze. For an early Indian stone image with comparable cross-belt on the back, see the Dumduma Yaksa in the State Museum of Orissa, in K.C. Panigrahi, Archaeological Remains at Bhubaneswar, Bombay-Calcutta 1961, pp. 207-8, fig. 5. Be that as it may, there cannot be a shadow of doubt that during the early centuries, both before and after the commencement of the Christian era, it was Skanda-Kum?ra, not V?sudeva-Visnu, who enjoyed immense popularity in the Trans-Indus region. Just to sustain this statement it may be in order here to summon at least one piece of epigraphical evidence known from the area. This is a Br?hmi inscription in the Lahore Museum, datable to no later than to the middle of the 3rd century A.D. Collected from a site in the Hazara District, the stone-slab record refers to a shrine of Kum?ra-K?rttikeya constructed, interestingly enough, by a foreigner named Gasura S?phara, the son of Maka: k?ritoyam kum?ra-sth?nam gasurena maka-putrena s?pharena. See D.C. Sircar, 'Abbotabad Inscription of the time of Kadambesvarad?sa; Year 25', Epigraphia Indica, XXX, 1953-54, pp. 59-62.

For this very reason, it seems, such images were made of perishable materials, which is why they did not survive. Very likely, the one that the men of Porus took along to the battle-field was a wooden image; the light weight of the material would make it all the more probable for its use by a mobile army. Numismatic Issues More eloquent than literary allusions are the concrete data visually available in early Indian numismatics. The consecutive series and large number of coins issued by various royal and other authorities constitute a rich source of iconographical knowledge. A careful study of this substantial group of representational art is likely to provide some interesting insight into the pattern of image-making in ancient India. For the pre-Kus?na period in particular, perhaps no other single class of material is as vitally important as the monetary issues of various indigenous rulers. The most ancient currency system of the subcontinent, the punch-marked coins, is usually dated to the third century B.C. or earlier. Among the bewildering number of natural and abstract symbols with which the silver pieces were associated, the human figure is encountered only occasionally. In those rare instances where it is featured, we find, with minor variations, two principal modes of depiction: 1. a group of three figures standing side by side, apparently without any attributes in their hands (fig. 1) (8); 2. a single figure, also standing, holding a long staff in his left hand and a waterpot or some such object in his right (fig. 2) (9). The solitary figure has tentatively been identified by J. Allan as an image of K?rttikeya (10). Following his lead we might be tempted to think that the group of three was meant to represent Skanda/Kum?ra-Vis?kha-Mah?sena as subsequently found on some gold coins of the Kus?na emperor Huviska (n). Or else, if one of them is a female, the trio can be considered as a prototype of Samkarsana-Ek?narhs?-V?sudeva, an iconic group which was destined to become popular in the Kus?na art of Mathur? (12). If we accept these human figures as deities, a simple corollary to this proposition would be: all other symbols on the punch-marked coins have similar religious implication. (8) J.

Fig. 2 - Single human figure on silver punch-marked and Ujjain copper coins. Fig. 3 - Three-headed human figure on uninscribed Ujjain copper coins, variety L. In such case it is obvious that, by virtue of variety and multiplicity, symbol worship was overwhelmingly dominant while the idea of actual images was only nascent till the end of the 3rd century B.C. In the next series circulated by various monarchical and republican states, collectively known to numismatists as Tribal coins', there is a distinct change in the scheme of representation. Along with the symbols human figures are now being given more and more importance. With the help of occasional legends and other clues, provided in some instances by the configuration itself, one may recognize the depiction of a few deities among them. Although it is difficult to date these pieces with accuracy, scholars usually put the whole series roughly between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. We are concerned here only with those examples that are likely to be of pre-Kus?na age and clearly depict, or anticipate in the depiction, some of the deities of Brahmanical theistic cults. There can be little doubt that the female figure on the issues of the local rulers of Mathur?, from Gomitra II to Sivadatta (c. 200-50 B.C.), was intended to be the goddess Laksmi (13). She is shown not only holding a lotus in the raised right hand but, more importantly, standing on a full-blown lotus as well. Also the standing male on a class of uninscribed Ujjain coins (14) can hardly be a profane motif. In one variety he is shown as a three-headed being (fig. 3), the precursor of Siva Mah?k?la or K?rttikeya Sad?nana (15). The lotus base in the case of the female and the polycephalic form in that of the male figures are sure enough sign to elevate them to some categories of divine beings, whatever their real identity may be. Quite interesting are the Panc?la series (c. 2nd-lst centuty B.C.) since, more often than not, there is some detectable relationship between the name of the ruler on the observe and the device on the reverse side of the same coin. For example, the male (13) Allan, CAI, pp. cviii and 170 ff., pi. XXV/1-2, 26; Mitchiner, op. cit., p. 569, no. 4498. (14) Allan, CAI, p. 248, pi. XXXVIII/11-12.

[7] 117</page><page sequence="8">with flaming hair on Agnimitra's issues (16) and the figure with a discus-like object on Visnumitra's may very well be the namesake deity of the Mitra ruler concerned (17). Elsewhere the intended deity is depicted by means of a clearly perceptible symbol, such as the roundel with radiating rays atop a pillar on Bh?nu and S?ryamitra's coins (18), and the trident on Rudragupta's (19). Similarly, a few more rulers of the dynasty tacitly made known their personal attachment to some Brahmanical god or goddess (20). Indeed no other single group of indigenous monarchs can be found to have depicted so many different deities in numismatic art. It should not escape our attention that in none of the coins discussed so far, is the purported divinity claimed to be such by an accompanying legend. The punch marked ones as well as the Ujjain and Mathur? pieces, of course, are uninscribed, and we may well leave them aside. The Panc?la series does bear in each instance the name of the issuer in Br?hmi characters on the obverse; but on the reverse there is no attempt to identify the subject by means of any inscription. It can certainly be argued that these were local issues meant for circulation among those who would instantly know what the reverse device stood for and, hence, a label would have been redundant. The force of this argument, however, is neutralized by some incontrovertible evidence from the Kuninda and Yaudheya (2nd-3rd century A.D.) coinage. On the issues of the former where Siva is shown standing with a trident, we find the Br?hmi legend: bh?gavata-catreivara-mah?tmanah (21). Likewise, the Yaudheya pieces bearing an image of six-headed K?rttikeya carries in the same script the inscription: bhdgavata-svdmtno brahmanya-devasya kumdrasya (22). In both cases the deity (Siva and K?rttikeya respectively) is justly named, even with an honorific prefix. One may still argue that the local authorities took to writing the names of the deities on coins from the 2nd-3rd century A.D. only and that the question does not arise for the Panc?la Mitra kings who, in all probability, ruled in the pre-Christian age. In anticipation of this reasoning we need to cite just one more evidence from among the tribal coinage itself. This piece is a rare silver issue of the Audumbara chief Dharaghosa who ruled some time in the 1st century B.C. over portions of what is now known as Panjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh in India. In this coin the obverse device consists of a standing male with lion/tiger skin over the left arm and (16) Allan, CAl, pp. cxvii and 199-201, pi.

XXXIX/21. 118 [8]</page><page sequence="9">the following Kharosthi legend along the periphery: mahadevasa rana dharaghosasa odubarisa (23). Exactly the same sentence occurs on the reverse too, but in Br?hmi letters; there the motif is a trident with axe beside a tree-in-railing. What*is of real interest is the fact that the personage on the observe is identified as 'Vispamitra' by a Kharosthi label that runs across the figure itself. The image may represent either the sage Visv?mitra or, more probably, Siva-Visvesvara/Visvan?tha (24), as the trident and-axe association would suggest. The fundamental point to be noticed is that the trend to add an identification label to a deity (or holy character) had indeed started in the pre-Christian era, even among the indigenous rulers. And yet the Panc?la kings, who depicted so many of the Brahmanical gods on their coins, did on no occasion try to emulate the practice. The inescapable question is: what prevented them from doing so? In any attempt to resolve this problem ? a puzzle for both numismatists and iconographers alike ? none can afford to forget that the Audumbaras occupied a frontier territory bordering almost on Gandh?ra. In comparison with other contemporary Indian kingdoms their contact with alien races must have been more direct, if not intimate. They might even have had a considerable foreign population among their subjects. The fact that the Kharosthi script was extensively used in Audumbara coin legends, is in itself a good indication to that effect. It is, hence, probable that in such a heterogeneous society image-worship in public was not an odium. By contrast, the Panc?la kingdom in the Gangetic Doab was naturally far less directly exposed to new people and fresh ideas. If the enlightened Mitra rulers resorted to figural representation of personal deities as numismatic devices, it was entirely their private affair. With due regard for what was sacrosanct to the orthodox priestly class, however, the monarchs seem to have prudently refrained from proclaiming the figures caterorically as deities. Epigraphical Records Early Indian inscriptions referring particularly to Brahmanical deities or images are not many in number. One of the earliest in the group is the Ghos?ndi Stone Inscription found near Nagari in the Chitorgadh District of Rajasthan (25). The (23) Allan, CAI, pp. lxxxiv and 124, pi. XIV/14. (24) The name calls to mind Siva as Visvan?tha in V?r?nasi and Visvesvara in the Kul? Valley, nearer the ancient habitats of the Audumbaras. For the early medieval 'Basheshar Mah?deo' shrine at the latter site, see J.Ph. Vogel, The Temple of Mah?deva at Bajaur?, Kul?', ASIAR, 1909-10, pp. 18-24. However, for some persuasive arguments preferring the sage to the deity in the depiction, see Kalyan Kumar Dasgupta, A Tribal History of Ancient India: A Numismatic Approach, Calcutta 1974, pp. 42 ff.

[9] 119</page><page sequence="10">epigraph records the construction of a railing or enclusure wall (pr?k?ra) around what the text calls the 'p?j?sil?' of the divine Samkarsana and V?sudeva by a certain Sarvatr?ta. It was engraved probably in the 1st century B.C., if not earlier. In view of its early date and its mention of the two deities whose images abound in the Mathur? school of sculpture during the Kus?na period, the record deserves to be studied afresh. As to the interpretation of the epigraph there is hardly any consensus among scholars. Most of them were drawn to the subject by religious history in general and the development of Vaisnavism in particular. In that approach it was of secondary importance whether Samkarsana and V?sudeva, two of the deified hero-gods of Mathur?, were represented at Ghos?ndi by symbols or by actual images. A categorical answer to this question, which is of great importance for our present quest, is far from easy. The real difficulty lies in the cryptic language of the record as such, especially in the term p?j?sil?. Literally it means no more than a block or slab of stone intended for some form of worship. On the analogy of the sil?patta or ?y?gapata of the Jainas, which were customary objects of veneration about this time elsewhere, one may be entitled to assume that the two deities mentioned in the epigraph were not necessarily depicted here in the form of figural sculpture. For nowhere in the record occurs an appropriate term indicative of a real image, such as pratimd. Compare, for example, the expression bhagavato patim? in the Parkham Yaksa statue inscription as restored by H. L?ders (26). There is a significant difference between the terms ?l?patta (p?j?sil? in the present instance) and pratimd. That the composers of early inscriptions were not unaware of this distinction can be illustrated by a recently discovered document. Brought to the Mathur? Museum from Mirj?pur and of the time of Sod?sa (c. 10-25 A.D.), this stone slab record contains a list of various gifts made by the wife of M?lavasu, the treasurer of the Mah?ksatrapa (27). Two of the items that the pious lady is said to have donated are of special interest for us. These are an image of Sri-Laksmi (in view of the donor herself being the wife of the treasurer, what else in the same inventory could be more appropriate as a gift?), and a stone object of uncertain nature. To be noted in particular here, is the simultaneous occurrence of the terms pratim?sil?patta ca. Had these been meant for one and the same object, we cannot help wondering how the conjunction ca (= and/also) fits in conveying that idea. It is more than probable that the two terms are not synonymous, nor is one the adjective of the other. By virtue of this impossible equation it becomes all the more likely that the word p?j?sil? in the Ghos?ndi inscription was not used in the sense of an actual image or images. In this context it may be worthwhile to refer to the N?n?gh?t Cave Inscription (26) H. L?ders, Mathura Inscriptions, Unpublished Papers ed. Klaus Janert, G?ttingen 1961, p. 177. (27) B.N. Mukherjee, Mathur? and Its Society: The Saka-Pahlava Phase, Calcutta 1981, pp. 218-20, pi. IV/24; R.C. Sharma, Buddhist Art of Mathur?, Delhi 1984, pi.

Attributed to the 1st century B.C. at the latest, the epigraph commences with invocations to a number of Brahmanical deities including Samkarsana and Vasudeva. It is mainly a detailed record of the various Vedic sacrifices performed and lavish donations heaped on the br?hmanas by the S?tav?hana royalty. Further, as if to associate them with these acts of merit and munificence in a unique way, several members of the royal family were visually represented on the back wall of the cave. Among the earliest and exceptionally rare examples of portraiture in Indian art, each of the individuals in the gallery was thoughtfully identified by a separate label inscribed above its head. It is rather surprising that while so many of the human beings were immortalized in the rock relief, none of the divine ones was given a place in the artistic programme of N?n?gh?t. It appears even intriguing in view of the fact that, after all, the epigraph was a major record of religious observances and that due obeisance to the gods was accorded in its preamble. At this stage we need to note a couple of interesting points. First, except for two of the hero-gods of the Vrsni clan, Samkarsana and V?sudeva, the rest of the deities invoked ? Indra, Varuna, Yama, S?rya and their likes ? are Vedic in character. Secondly, the numerous sacrifices performed are again part of the traditional Vedic religious rituals. Brahmanical Deities in pre-Kusdna Art In tune with the epigraphical indications the remains of purely Brahmanical sculptures of the pre-Christian era are also scanty. We do not overlook the possibility that a certain number of images must have been made of perishable materials like wood or unbaked clay. We also admit that along with these examples a considerable amount of those that were carved in stone might not have survived either. However, if we suppose that the extant pieces formed just one per cent of the total sculptures that had once been in worship, even then the number of images made at that time does not seem to have been appreciably large vis-?-vis the extensive area covered by Brahmanical faith. As in numerical strength, so in grandiosity of conception these sculptures seldom, if ever, surpass the Yaksa-Yaksini statues of the Maurya-Sunga periods. A brief discussion of some early icons may be useful to get an idea of the extent, variety and patterns of image worship during the 2nd-lst century B.C., before the advent of the Kus?nas. One of the earliest stone sculptures of the Mathur? region, (28) G. B?hler, 'The N?n?gh?t Inscriptions', inj.

[11] 121</page><page sequence="12">actually from Jansuti, is the figure of Balar?ma, also known as Samkarsana (29). The deity is depicted under the canopy of a seven-hooded serpent, standing with his right leg flexed, very much like the Kubera on a Bh?rhut pillar (30). But for the short pestle and the long plough in the hands, the two-armed figure is hardly distinguishable from a Yaksa or a N?ga. This synoptic adaptation from, or ready reliance upon, folk-cult statues may not be without some meaning. It should be recalled that Sarhkarsana Vasudeva commanded devotion already in the 4th century B.C. in P?nini's time, and this sculpture in the Lucknow Museum is of about the 2nd century B.C. In spite of the passage of roughly two hundred years there is little sign of development of the iconography itself in the configuration of the image. A plausible reason for this peculiarity may be that such icons had been made, at best, only occasionally in the past. We get a similar impression from another image which can be identified as V?sudeva, a thematically related counterpart of the Jansuti piece. Presently under worship at Malh?r, Central India, it is a four-armed and inscribed sculpture (31). (29) Lucknow Museum No. G. 215. See V.S.

Further, Nanditha Krishna, The Art and Iconography of Vishnu-N?r?yana, Bombay 1980, p. 84, pi. 12. The credit of identifying the sculpture as 'Chaturbhuja Vishnu', rather than an attendant of the deity ('Vishvakasena, the door-keeper of Vishnu' ? according to Venkataramayya) goes to Ms. Krishna. This she has done by pointing out that the so-called anjalimudr? in the carving is really the conch, vertically held by the figure in such a manner as can actually be seen in a later image of Visnu from N?land?. It may, however, be advisable to label the Malh?r image as V?sudeva instead, which is what the deity is called in archaelogical documents of the pre-Christian period; just for example, 'Devadeva V?sudeva' in the Besnagar Garuda Pillar Inscription of bh?gavata ? and not vaisnava ? Heliodorus (see fn. 35 below). That it is not a distinction without some difference, can very well be appreciated from the continuation of the practice in subsequent periods as well. Even the Gupta rulers, though ardent devotees of the god, preferred to designate themselves also as parama-bh?gavatas. As far as we can trace, the epithet parama-vaisnava seems to have been first assumed by King Dharasena of the Traik?taka dynasty of Western India, about 456 A.D., both in his epigraphic and numismatic records. See E.J. Rapson, A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum: Coins of the Andhra Dynasty, the Western Ksatrapas, the Traik?takas and the 'Bodhi Dynasty, London 1908/repr. 1967, pp. clxiii and 198 ff., pi.

[13] 123</page><page sequence="14">Although the short inscription contains little else than names of both the donor and the carver, yet it does help date the image palaeographically to c. 1st century B.C. The deity is shown holding a huge mace and a disc with his upper right and left hands respectively and a conch-shell vertically held by the remaining two. Additional limbs and attributes notwithstanding, the archaic quality of the sculpture betrays lack of previous practice in the craft. Apart from the above examples there are, from this period, two Saivite pieces relevant to our present concern. The first, and most probably the earliest of the two, is a five-faced linga from Bhit? (fig. 4), now in the Lucknow Museum. The ingenious arrangment of the five faces on the stone deserves close attention. The top of the shaft is chiselled in the shape of a male bust with two arms, which gives the impression that the sculptor was initially inspired to carve a standing image. As an after-thought, it might seem, he changed his mind and decided to add, half way down the column, four different heads of the deity oriented to four directions. Further, to emphasize the linga aspect, rather than the human form of the god, an additional phallic emblem was engraved (possibly at a later date) on to the shaft even though in the inscription the icon is called just that: khajahuti putanam lingo (32). The earliest sculpture known so far depicting the full figure of Siva is enshrined in a temple at Gudimallam, Andhra Pradesh (33). Here the two-armed deity is shown standing upon the shoulder of a crouching demon. The sculptor's overriding concern, however, is once again the majesty of the linga, the figure being merely a part of it. In fact, the forcefully carved and realistically shaped phallic emblem literally dwarfs the image itself. Most certainly the emblem was too fundamental to Saiva worship throughout the ages, even after independent images of the deity came into vogue. Nevertheless, in our pursuit of the evolution of figural sculpture of the god both Bhit? and Gudimallam provide two important milestones. As far as the trend to represent the divinity in purely human form is concerned, there is a definite sign of progress from the Bhit? icon to the Gudimallam image. It seems the trend reached only thus far and could proceed no further until the Kus?na art of Mathur? provided the required momentum. (32) R.D.

More revealing is the fact that in the repertoire of early Indian sculpture (pre-Kus?na and non-Buddhist, that is) such Vedic gods as Indra, S?rya and Praj?pati-Brahm? are significantly absent. Nor are they easily encountered among the Maurya-Sunga terracottas, which depict mostly the Yaksas, N?gas and other folk deities. Even if it is proved that some patently Brahmanical gods were actually represented in pre-Kus?na terracottas, the question remains why they are not found in the lithic medium as well. After all, the technique of stone carving was by then well established, as testified by the series of magnificent Yaksas, Yaksinis and other monumental sculptures known from Patna, Parkham, Paw?y? and Besnagar. Rather than of technical competence it seems to have been a problem of entirely different nature; a kind of psychological inhibition that had developed ever since the coming of the Aryans. This deep-rooted tradition was not effected until some other historical forces imposed themselves on the existing system, both materially and spiritually. The spiritual impetus was generated from within by the advent of Buddhism, Jainism, and other rival religious movements. The material incentive needed, as appears from the course of events, was effectively provided by fresh ethnic elements like the Indo-Greeks and the Scytho-Parthians. These invaders apparently conquered the land but, as it were, enlarged and enriched the Indian population by adding new dimensions to its social psychology. It is remarkable that three of the Vedic gods ? Indra, Brahma and S?rya ? were introduced in visual art not by the followers of Brahmanical faith but, paradoxically enough, by the Buddhist 'heretics'. Even before representing their Master in human form the Buddhists depicted these deities apropos of the life-scenes of S?kyamuni: the Birth, the Descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven, the Indras?la Cave episode and so forth. Besides, the two detailed reliefs of S?rya and Indra on the walls of the Bh?j? vih?ra, perhaps the earliest representation of these divinities in Indian art, owe their origin to this source (34). In propagating Brahmanical religion and, for that matter, in the formation of early Indian art no less direct was the role of some foreigners who arrived before the Kus?nas. Among those of Greek pedigree Heliodorus, the ambassador of King Antialcidas of Taxila, not only accepted Bh?gavatism but also erected an impressive Garuda Pillar at Besnagar. Even if the claim of the Br?hmi inscription on the monument (34) Again a favourite subject of illustration, the two reliefs are frequently reproduced in the textbooks of Indian art of which the following two easily accessible references will suffice: Coomaraswamy, op. cit., pis. VII/24 and VIII/27; H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformation, edited and completed by J. Campbell, New York 1954, vol. II, pis. 41-42. [15] 125</page><page sequence="16">be interpreted more as an act of diplomacy than as real devotion to the god V?sudeva, the fact remains that the column would not have been there in the first place save for the enterprise of this self-styled 'Yavana', {bh?gavatena heliodorena [...] yona d?tena) (35). It should be borne in mind that except this outstanding example of c. 2nd century B.C. there were not many antecedents of its kind to go by for the Gupta rulers, who proclaimed themselves also as followers of Bh?gavatism (parama-bh?gavata), erected Garudadhvajas, and made the same their royal insignia (36). Heliodorus may or may not have installed an image, too, of the god he claimed he was devotionally attached to, viz., V?sudeva. But representation of both V?sudeva and Sarhkarsana are to be found on the numismatic issues of one of his compatriots. Discovered not long ago at Ai Khanum in ancient Bactria, Northern Afghanistan, this gold coin type of the Indo-Greek King Agathocles (c. 180-165 B.C.) has for the observe and reverse devices these two most important hero-gods of Mathur? (37). Although not so clear and convincing in every instance as in this case, a few other Brahmanical deities can be discerned on the monetary issues of some Scytho-Parthian rulers as well. For example, Durg? appears on the coins of Azes (38), Siva on those of Maues and Gondophares (39). (35) D.R. Bhandarkar, 'Excavations at Besnagar', ASIAR, 1913-14, pp. 186 ff., pi. LIII; for the inscription only, see Sircar, Select Inscriptions, pp. 88-89. (36) The only other monument of its type and time was the one of Gautamiputra, installed in the 12th year of Mah?r?ja Bh?gavata. For the fragments of this pillar found at nearby Bhilsa, see D.R. Bhandarkar, op. cit., pp. 190-91. As an epithet of the Gupta monarchs parama-bh?gavata is used in several records. Cf. the Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta, lines 5-6, in J.F.

In this context, one of the rock engravings at a remote site in the Upper Indus Valley requires more than a passing mention. Lately found near Chilas, it contains the depiction of two standing male figures: one carrying 'a spear ending with a plough at its lower end', and the other holding a discuss in his right hand. What is of abiding interest is that, unlike those on the coins of Agathocles, these two figures are categorically stated to be Baladevo (Samkarsana) and Vasudebo (V?sudeva) respectively in the KharosthT label beside each. See A.H. Dani, Chilas ? The City of Nanga Parvat (Dyamar), Islamabad 1983, pp. 104-6, pi. 79 (not pi. 80, as misprinted in the publication on p. 101). (38) Banerjea, DHI, pp. 134-35, pi. IX/5.

From an early Br?hmi inscription recently found at Reh, Uttar Pradesh (40), it is possible to associate the owner of the record with the sandstone Sivalinga (41) upon which it is engraved. Unfortunately, the damaged epigraph keeps to itself the name of the donor. But from the already deciphered, long and resounding titles [mah?r?jasa r?jar?jasa mah?mtasa tr?t?rasa dh?mmikasa jayamtasa [...]) he appears to have been a Scytho Parthian, if not really Indo-Greek, celebrity (42). More illuminating is the evidence of the now famous Mor? Well Inscription found in the vicinity of Mathur?. Of the time of Mah?ksatrapa Sod?sa, it records the installation of a set of images of the five Vrsni hero-gods (bhagavatdm vrsnindm pancavir?n?m pratim?h) by a certain lady Tos? (43). Acknowledged as an important document for the Vy?ha doctrine of Vaisnavism, the record means a little more than just that. The donor has been recognized by some scholars as of Saka extraction (44). For the clear absence of any suitable epithet indicative of a higher social status, she (40) G.R. Sharma, Reh Inscription of Menander and the Indo-Greek Invasion of the Ganga Valley, Allahabad 1980, pp. 5-11, pis. V-VII, also front &amp; back end papers. (41) Shri D.P. Sharma, who should be credited for the discovery of this important monument, has made rather an incredible surmise that it was a 'victory pillar which has been converted into a Siva-liriga and placed in a rectangular argha, erected in the early medieval period'. See his article, 'Some New Finds in Fatehpur District, Uttar Pradesh', in Pur?tattva, Bulletin of the Indian Archaeological Society, No. 11, 1979-80, pp. 65-66. Placed it might have been on to a rectangular accessory of medieval period, but a victory pillar most probably it was not. At least no reason whatever has been set forth in support of the hypothesis. On the other hand, if one is not oblivious of certain Kus?na Siva-lingas of Mathur? (see p. 6 of Prof. G.R. Sharma's monograph cited in our previous note) one would be more inclined to think of the Reh stone as a prototype of the Mathur? pieces. That such objects of worship were not confined to Mathur? alone, is evident from the discovery of an Ekamukha linga from Agh?pura, Rajasthan, now in the State Museum, Bharatpur (see R.C. Agrawala, 'Some Kus?na Sculptures in the National Museum, Delhi and allied problems', Bulletin of Museums &amp; Archaeology in U.P., 3, 1969, pp. 6 ff., fig. 2). Especially noteworthy is the tall shaft of this Kus?na linga. By virtue of its phraseology and the palaeography the inscribed Reh piece is certainly earlier than any of the Kus?na lingas and, as such, may not have any exact parallel. However, if we compare the shaft-to-nut ratio of the Reh stone with that of the Agh?pura Ekamukha linga, there is little scope for question that the former was installed for any other purpose than religious. As long as there is some impeccable evidence of linga worship by early alien rulers (fig. 5) and no ostensible example of victory pillars set up by them, we have reason to believe the Reh monument to be a plain Siva linga. (42) For the view that the Reh epigraph refers to a Scytho-Parthian ruler, as opposed to Indo-Greek, see B.N. Mukherjee, op. cit., pp. 245-52, esp. p. 249. (43) L?ders, op. cit., p. 154, no. 113. For further inscriptions from Mor? referring to shrines and images (mah?sth?na and pratima) of the same cult, cf. nos. 114-15 in this work. Interestingly, fragments of no less than four different images were found at the site. See J.Ph. Vogel, Catalogue of the Archaeological Museum at Mathur?, Allahabad 1910, pp. 109-10, nos. E 20-23. Two of these, a male torso and the lower half of an inscribed female figure, are illustrated in Rosenfield, op. cit., figs. 51-52. (44) Banerjea, DHI, p. 94. [17] 127</page><page sequence="18">appears to have been a commoner, albeit of no meagre means. This may well suggest that, apart from royalty and nobilty, some ordinary individuals among alien populations contributed in no small way to the cause of early Indian art. What is indicated by the epigraphical records may, indeed, be substantiated by a visual document of unusual value (fig. 5). Found at Mathur? itself and gratifyingly now in the local museum, it is a fragmentary stele (45) that provides a lamentably rare glimpse of socio-religious life of the city during its burgeoning days. The relief depicts a Sivalinga properly installed on a raised pedestal; the sanctity of the spot is highlighted by a flying Gandharva or Vidy?dhara hovering above. The scene is further enlivened by the presence of two male devotees (there may have been more male or females on the now missing left half of the panel) approaching the icon with floral offerings. It is more for the association of the worshippers, not because of just the object of worship, that the scene becomes really meaningful. Of singular interest is the fact that both devotees are attired in the dress characteristic of the Indo-Scythian people. The little that remains of the whole composition is enough for a perceptive historian to reconstruct the extent to which these people were directly involved with Brahmanical religion and art. In consideration of the data which we have so far been able to cite, it would appear that, more than material support it was the ideological attitude of the foreign population that was catalytic for the outburst of image making at Mathur? in the Kus?na period. In order to appreciate the point it is necessary to realize the full implication of the deified images of the Vrsni heroes which Tos? caused to be made at the Mor? site. Except the already referred to rock-relief at N?n?gh?t there is almost nothing of its kind in early Indian art. Even here the idea of carving effigies of the S?tav?hana royalty, as observed by J.M. Rosenfield (46), might have been possible due to some contact with Iran or Tranized Kshatrapas' in the area. That the concept of portraiture was something of an anathema to the Indian psyche may be apparent from the early coinage. Even the Panc?la rulers who are supposed to have depicted various deities on the reverse of their coins, avoided putting their own likeness on the obverse. In contrast to this traditional outlook of the land the formal installation of the Mor? images, representing as they do both legendary kings and deities at the same time, was an epoch-making event. Introducing a break-through in the hitherto observed general practice, the incident virtually hacked a broad path along which the full creative potentiality of the artist, matching with both the material support and spiritual (45) First published by V.S. Agrawala, 'The Vine Motif in Mathur? Art', JISOA, IV, 1936, p. 130, pi. XXIII/1. See also Rosenfield, op. cit., fig. 41 and, in addition, fig. 29. The latter, since donated by a certain Sarhghadeva, is most probably not strictly Brahmanical; yet the two panels with Indian and Indo-Scythian devotees in one and the same railing pillar is instructive. More so is the Sahr-1-B?hlol relief, fig. 68 in the publication. Irrespective of their sectarian affiliation these carvings afford interesting insight into the social realities in the Kus?na empire, whether it was Mathur? or Gandh?ra does not matter. (46) Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 153. 128 [18]</page><page sequence="19">aspiration of the dovotee, would proceed with increasing momentum. Sure enough, within a few decades we find grand portrait statues of the great Kus?nas in the Mat sanctuary (47), and hundreds of icons of very many Brahmanical gods and goddesses, besides Buddhist and Jaina images ? all in Mathur?. Brahmanical Images in Kus?na Art Brahmanical images of the earlier periods, whether made due to Indian urge or foreign initiative, were limited both in number and variety. By contrast, iconography took, as it were, a Quantum Leap during the Kus?na age. No doubt, gradual emergence of the Bhakti cults and accumulation of surplus wealth from ever expanding trade and commerce contributed greatly to the growth of religious art of the time. In some measure these factors, as testified by the previously mentioned N?n?gh?t record, were present also in the S?tav?hana age (48). And yet, very few Brahmanical sculptures are known from that empire deep in the interior of India. Hence, apart from material resources and spiritual fervour something else was necessary for the flourishing of devotional art. That vital element, we may reiterate, was the change in the basic outlook of the people, that the likeness of a human figure can indeed be a vehicle of conveying supernatural forces. Indoctrinated by Vedic metaphysical thoughts for so long, the Indian mind had regarded the supreme spiritual power and the mortal human being as an irreconcilable dichotomy. For traditional Indian society, where else could a reorientation in such fundamental notions have been effected but in the cosmopolitan milieu of Mathur?, the great metropolis and nerve centre of the Kus?na empire? In the process that led to the general recognition of divine presence in the image of man, the contribution of the Mathur? artist was most crucial. In giving visual form to a wide range of divinities ? male, female, androgynous; single, group, or composite (49) ? the Kus?na sculptor's prime concern was the human figure. It was his imagination, inventiveness and assured handling of the human figure that finally brought forth the efflorescence of Brahmanical imagery of the period. How this was accomplished will be evident if we look into a few select examples from among the seemingly unmanageable mass of material already at our disposal. (47) J.Ph. Vogel, 'Explorations at Mathur?', ASIAR, 1911-12, pp. 120 ff., pis. LIII-VI; Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 140, figs. 1-10. (48) See fn. 28 above.

[19] 129</page><page sequence="20">Among a dozen or so types of Saiva icons turned out by the Mathur? ateliers, not a few are the instances where the deity is represented in fully human form. What is certainly a novelty in these carvings, is the depiction of the god in his own right, dissociated from the integral symbol ? the phallus. At Gudimallam, as we have already seen, the figure is incidental and subservient to the towering and overpowering emblem. In a comparable Mathur? piece, now in the University Museum, Philadelphia (50), it is the manifestation of Siva that is brought into full focus. In this sculpture the imposing presence of Siva in human form obscures and relegates the lihga in the background almost beyond recognition, so much so that even to Coomaraswamy's discerning eye the image appeared to be that of a Bodhisattva. A 'logical' sequel to this carving would have been another, of which, regrettably, only the head has survived (fig. 6). At present in the National Museum, New Delhi, this head, carved in the round, is rather unusual in that, instead of the customary matted locks Siva is shown to have ringlets of hair bound by a ribbon. While publishing the piece R.C. Agrawala has described the peculiarity, in this case with some justification, as 'unique' (51). Commenting on its form Kramrisch has observed that, although free from Gandh?ran influence, the work bears close stylistic affinity with 'archaizing Roman art'. She has further pointed out that the fillet, 'unusual in Indian sculpture', and the shape of Siva's cranium, both have antecedents in a Mohenjodaro figure (52). However that may be, precisely for the same reasons a more direct comparison is available from a Bh?rhut relief (fig. 7) (53). Note, for instance, the strikingly similar ringlets of hair bound by a broad band in the head shown here in three-quarter profile. Interestingly, the Bh?rhut personage is attired like a Saka warrior, and this phenomenon may be meaningful in explaining the unusual characteristics of the Mathur? Siva head. After all, more than any other location in Central India Mathur? is well known to have been a great centre of Saka culture in India. Most important from our point of view is the fact that the National Museum head is a sculpture in the round; which means the image of Siva in its pristine form must have been independent of the linga, a fully human image of the god.

See his paper in the Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Bombay 1947, pp. 65 ff. In our opinion it was the Sakas, rather than the Indo-Greeks, who were more involved with Buddhist monuments in the interior of India. Their presence was felt as far deep as the South Eastern seaboard. See J.Ph. Vogel, 'Prakrit Inscriptions from a Buddhist Site at N?g?rjunikonda', Epigraphia Indica, XX, 1929-30, pp. 1-37, especially p. 37. 130 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 5 - Relief showing worship of Sivalinga by Indo-Scythian devotees, Mathur?.

The flat back of the sculpture, it should be noted, contains the representation of an Asoka tree {Saraca indica) in low relief (fig. 9). Since the icon does not show any sign of having been part of a phallic emblem, the real identification of this Mathur? Museum stele has remained elusive. Presumably, because the deity is four-headed, a more usual characteristic of Brahm? than of other divinities of the Brahmanical pantheon, previous scholars were led to believe it to be an image of that god (54). However, rather than relying exclusively on the number of the heads, we need to look for other telltale clues in the details of the carving. In this effort most striking is the distinctive treatment of the faces. Of the three in the lower tier, the bearded face on the proper right is invested with a crown of skulls, a horizontal third eye and a fierce expression (55). Placid in mood, the central face is clearly devoid of beard. Even in its damaged state the next visage retains some markedly feminine traits, showing not only a graceful mien but also a floral or jewelled ornament along the parting of the hair (simantd) right on to the forehead. These are not the sole but sufficient reasons to maintain our contention. When compared with the Pancamukhalihga from Bhit? (fig. 4), which has also a super-imposed bust, the cult affiliation of the present piece will be all the more clear. Having recognized Aghora and Vamadeva in the lateral heads (proper right and left respectively) we can regard this as an image of Siva in his Mahesam?rti/Sad?siva form. If the proposed identification is accepted, the Mathur? sculpture would be the earliest known Saiva icon of this type in Indian art. Among the bountiful number of Vaisnava icons the one that testifies to the inventive skill of the Mathur? artist at its best, is perhaps the image of Caturvy?ha Visnu (fig. 10). Like the Siva in the previous illustration which shows different aspects of the god in a single image, this too is an attempt at visual rendering of the various emanations (54) V.S. Agrawala, 'A Catalogue of the Brahmanical Images in Mathur? Art', (repr. from the Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society, XIII, 1949, pp. 102-210), pp. 1-2; K.D. Bajpai, 'A Note on the Iconography of Brahma', Bulletin of the Baroda Museum and Picture Gallery, V, 1947-48, p. 18. Unsurprisingly, though, R.C. Agrawala happens to be one who, with rare iconological acumen, has already identified the image as that of a four-faces Siva just because, 'The first and third faces bear horizontal third eyes, on the foreheads'. See his, Tour-Faced Siva and Four-Faced Visnu at Mathur?', Vishveshvar?nand Indo logical Journal, III, 1965, pp. 107-10, with two line-drawings. (In the illustration of this relief, as produced by the author, the first face is inadvertently shown to have actually a vertical eye on the forehead. Compare this with another line-drawing of the same, fig. 168 of the publication cited in our next fn.). (55) All these features had almost been noted by the former curator of the Mathur? Museum in his latest publication on the subject. See V.S. Agrawala, Indian Art (A history of Indian Art from the earliest times up to the third century A.D.), Varanasi 1965, fig. 168. In the line-drawing in fig. 168 the ovate forms on the crown of the proper right head are indeed the simulacra of the skulls that can be discerned in the photograph reproduced in our fig. 8. 132 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 7 - Warrior on a Railing Pillar from Bh?rhut, Inscribed.

The five deified heroes of the Vrsni clan, referred to in the Mor? Well Inscription and the V?yupur?na, are reduced to four with the elimination of Samba (57). According to the Vy?ha doctrine these four are: Samkarsana (Balar?ma/Baladeva), V?sudeva (Visnu), Pradyumna and Aniruddha. In order to appreciate the sagacity of the carver it may be worthwhile to recall the theogony of this quartet. On the mundane plane Baladeva is the elder brother of V?sudeva, while Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the latter's son and grandson in that order. V?sudeva is the supreme deity from whom emanate the others; this is precisely conveyed by V?sudeva being accorded the central position or focal point of the composition. From his shoulder level emerge the figure of Balar?ma on his right and Pradyumna (now broken off) to the left, while Aniruddha is represented as a super? imposed bust atop the main axis. Their close family relationship is ingeniously underscored on the back of the stele, by the relief of a Kadamba tree {anthocephallus cadamba) in which the main trunk corresponds to V?sudeva's position, the branches to those of his emanations (fig. 11) (58). No less interesting is the dexterity of the artist as evident in the decorative details. Every centimetre of the high crown and heavy mace of V?sudeva, as well as the serpent hood of Balar?ma, is chiselled with due care and consumate skill. The vanam?l? necklace of the main deity faithfully conforms to what that term literally means: a wreath of natural flowers, buds and leaves. The elegant type of vanam?l? instead of the common garland, the cylindrical mukuta crown in lieu of the usual Indian turban-like headdress, and the replacement of Balar?ma's conventional plough [hala] by a handy wine beaker are some of the novelties introduced by the Mathur? artist. Similarly noteworthy is the icon of the Sun god formulated for the first time in the Kus?na age (59). In the coins of Bh?numitra and S?ryamitra the deity was represented in the form of a plain disc (60). In pursuance of his penchant for (56) For a discussion of the Pancaratra doctrine of the Bhagavatas, see F.

(Coomaraswamy, op. cit., pis. VII/24 and XVII/61) cannot be considered as icons in the usual sense of the term. In both sites the depiction occurs in purely Buddhist contexts and as part of narrative reliefs, in contradistinction to a regular cult object. (60) See fn. 18 above. With these configurations on the P?nc?la coinage in mind, one may well suggest that the image in our fig. 12 is likely to be earlier than even the one Coomaraswamy (op. cit., 136 [26]</page><page sequence="27">anthropomorphism the Kus?na sculptor has transformed the symbol into an image, as may be observed in a rarely reproduced piece in the Mathur? Museum (fig. 12). In this example the god is shown seated, it may seem rather unconfortably, on his haunches. The circular shape of the stone provides a fitting back-drop to the deity. It must not be mistaken as an ordinary halo (prabh?mandala), however. The entire figure, it deserves to be noted, is encompassed within the disc. The alignment of the slanting legs is made to tally with the circumference of the stone; hence the unconventional and somewhat awkward sitting posture. It seems to be a perfect compromise between the erstwile Indian concept of the solar deity as a radiant orb in the firmament (savitrmandala), and the more practical need of the heterogenous masses who peopled Mathur? in the Kus?na age. At any rate, the composition marks a transitional stage from the earlier aniconism to later anthropomorphism. The few details that this much-worn figure still retains, may be helpful in tracing the immediate source of inspiration for this sculpture. The fluttering ribbon, no doubt, is suggestive of the dynamic movement of the heavenly body. But the sheathed sword or short dagger, the hilt of which the deity clasps with his left hand, is somewhat incongruous here. However, if we remember the accoutrements of the Saka warrior in the Bh?rhut relief (fig. 7), the combination of the weapon and head-gear of the Mathur? S?rya assumes some meaning. The conceptual image of a Scythian ruler, or an idiosyncrasy of the Indo-Scythians in general, must have been behind the configuration of the Sun god (61). Reflective of the same ambience of Mathur? is the Saptam?trk? group (fig. 13) recovered from Dhang?on. In this early Kus?na panel the seven divine mothers are presented in a row originally flanked by a lance-bearing male on either side (the one on the proper left is now lost). Each of the goddesses shows the same gesture and has similar attributes: abhayamudr? and waterpot. More interesting is their outlandish skirt in contrast to the usual Indian dhoti, especially in the depiction of Brahmanical deities. The kind of apparel clearly bears out for whom or by whom the panel was commissioned. From the rest of the female deities we need to discuss an arresting image of the Goddess of Fortune (fig. 14), now in the State Museum, Lucknow. It is an important visual document that records the process of transformation of a folk deity into an exalted member of the pantheon, acceptable to a wider circle of devotees. The portly goddess is shown frontally seated with legs down in what may be called pralambap?d?sana. The p. 67, pi. XXIX/103) thought was the earliest Mathur? figure of the god. For in that sculpture from the Saptasamudri Well, No. D 46 of the Mathur? Museum, the deity is shown to have a semicircular nimbus marked with striated rays and riding on a quadriga. It is not only the elaboration of details but also the advanced workmanship that can be the key factors in deciding the chronological relativity of the two pieces. (61) At this point it may be relevant to recall the beribboned head of an Indo-Scythian devotee on a Mathur? railing pillar, in Rosenfield, op. cit., fig. 24.

And yet, lest one mistakenly takes her for a mere Yaksini, the carver seems to have felt the necessity of adding a few more confirming details. These are: an offering table (not to be confused with a foot-stool) in front and a group of three supplicants in anjalimudr? to her right. Replenished with such extra paraphernalia the replica of a basically Maurya-Sunga Yaksini is now formally established as another variety of the goddess of wealth, like the better known Sri-Laksmi of Gaja-Laksmi. If this icon marks a stage in gradual transformation, the dynamic Durg? images of the period record the tumultous pace of development in religious imagery. The most advanced and well-preserved of the Mathura sculptures of the goddess, is the Mahis?sura-mardini in the Berlin Museum (fig. 15) (62). Apart from its ingeniously (62) H.

Seldom do we come across the sun and the moon as attributes of Durg?, which can be seen in two of the upper hands of this eight-armed deity (63). Nor is she often depicted standing on a pair of lions as in this artistically and iconographically remarkable sculpture. The final piece in our rapid survey of early Mathur? sculptures should be the one that depicts no less than four of the popular deities in one panel (fig. 16) (64). Proceeding from our right, the first figure is a lance-bearing K?rttikeya, the deity who was invoked by the martial classes {ksatriyas) for professional valour. The next is Gaja Laksmi, whom the mercantile communities (vais'yas) appeased for material prosperity in trade, commerce and other enterprises. The third is a four-armed Vasudeva-Visnu who, in his twin aspect as Balar?ma and Krsna, was lavished with loving devotion primarily by the agricultural and pastoral groups (s?dras). The last is Siva as Ardhan?risvara who, in his essential form as a phallic god, had so long been abhorred by the traditionally most authoritarian of the castes (br?hamanas) for centuries. The presentation of four of the sectarian deities, in a single composition, is instructive indeed. Besides providing a partial glimpse of the many different Brahmanical divinities common in Kus?na art, the panel further documents the prevailing social accord and amity among their followers in cosmopolitan Mathur?. This liberal outlook of the Kus?na metropolis was due as much to the city's rich ethnic formation as to its ideological reciprocity with various other cultures maintained through Gandh?ra on the historic gateway into India. (63) As a sequel to the trend in Kus?na Mathur?, the seedbed of Brahmanical iconography, the same astral divinities are shown in anthropomorphic form in another sculpture. See the attributes in the extra pair of hands of an inscribed Var?ha, in N.P. Joshi, Mathur? Sculptures ? A Hand Book to Appreciate the Sculptures in the Archaeological Museum, Mathur?, Mathur? 1966, pi. 101; Id., 'A Var?ha Image of the Kus?na Period', Lalit Kal?, 12, 1962, pp. 46-47, pi. XXX/1. (64) For this panel we can hardly think of a more appropriate caption than the one already coined by the most distinguished custodian of the storehouse of Mathur? art, V.S. Agrawala. See his, A Catalogue of the Brahmanical Images in Mathur? Art, p. 41: 'An Eclectic Iconographic Document'. Although unfortunately bereft of illustrations, this least pretentious work is as yet the best source of information for Brahmanical iconography of Mathur?. In reproducing the few Mathur? Museum pieces in this paper we have drawn on the basic data contained in that publication. [33] 143</page></plain_text>
