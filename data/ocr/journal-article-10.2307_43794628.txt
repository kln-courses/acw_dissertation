<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robinson Jeffers: The Beauty Of Transhuman Things DIAME ACKERMAN I Diane Ackerman's third collection of poetry, Lady Faustus, will be published by Morrow in 1983. I Something 1 perfect embodiment elemental in of Robinson the American Jeffers poet, qualifies a certain him type as of the it, near- any- 1 perfect embodiment of the American poet, a certain type of it, any- way. Unworldly, unconniving, at odds with society both as he found it and foresaw it, he fits an apocryphally definitive idea of the American mind: close to nature, to the universe, closer to them than to fellow- humans, and inclined to prize in himself elements held in common with galaxies, rocks, stallions, or cormorants. He takes the big-sky idyll to an extreme and he achieves-drives his mind incessantly toward- an empathy writ so large that in the end the only quality that pulls some readers into his poems is the manner and tone. He talks preachily to him- self. He is a born explainer, even going so far as to prefer definitions of words to words themselves, which is another form of being candid or unsurreptitious. No jokes, no skittish asides counterpoint the earnest- ness of his vision which, methodically and acutely visual, seems to give off exhortatory vignettes. His poems feel illustrated, although there are no pictures in the margins, and the reader feels "got at" on several levels: seduced by the visuals, half-persuaded by the down-home spell-it- out-for-you that doesn't hesitate to repeat itself or, in the well-tempered onrush of declaration, doesn't hesitate to use a comma where something stronger belongs: But whence came the race of man? I will make a guess. A change of climate killed the great northern forests , Forcing the manlike apes down from their trees , They starved up there. They had been secure up there , But famine is no security : among the withered branches blue famine: They had to go down to the earth, where green still grew And small meats might be gleaned. ("The Beginning and the End") A precis of this would shed much of Jeff er s' s characteristic manner: the big ingenuous question, posed by a sample of the species that de- fines itself through posing just such questions; the humble but far from slack-minded retort or resolve, as if on behalf of a whole tribe's wonder- ers; the explanatory second line, echoing a children's encyclopedia while providing no less information than the latest Britannica ; the curbed respect for other forms, and the drama of the third line, making the episode both narrative and graphic; the run-on apposition at the start of the fourth line, when the reader expects a participle parallel to 4 4 Forcing"; the augment in tone thus achieved, of bemused consolidation which evinces sympathy through being iterative; then the echo in the second half of the fourth line, in which an incredulous-sounding whisper be- comes a point of reference, clinched by the crisp, summary tone of "famine is no security." If he seems to plod, it is to keep us from being glib or from thinking too soon we know what's going on. If he repeats, it's because this massive transhumance (or trans-simiance) merits more than a mere lingering look. And what an insidious style it is, as good for dense and almost seismic narrative poems of atavistic violence and blood-letting as for awed renderings of the science to be found in natural objects. But the style is something else too: not just a badge or an emblem, but (at least in the poems that instruct us in the holy impartiality of the uni- verse) a rhythm of discovery, a cadence to peer through a microscope or telescope by; it's as if he had his hand on some cogged wheel or other, slowly twisting givens into focus; it's what he says while doing some- thing else. The talky intermittance of a wholly occupied mind, it works on us in a special way, so much so that not only what he is saying matters, but also the how of it. Murmur gently along with him as he plies his investigative trade, and you find yourself taken over by a sound in which the clinical, the reverential, the obstinate combine, attuning your mind to teacherly gradations: The universe expands and contracts like a great heart. It is expanding , the farthest nebulae Rush with the speed of light into empty space. It will contract. . . . ('The Great Explosion") He's using "nebulae" there for "galaxies," I think, but the drift is clear: this is an art of deployed facts. Each line somehow suggests a capacity for infinite range, not merely through allusions to galaxies at the edge of the observable universe, but through a conjuring trick of the voice- an apperceptive voice which intones "This line may never end," a voice which embodies a reverence (and a sometimes itchy or querolous one at that) independent of all severance, sustaining the cumulative insight until it dwindles out. Such behavior in verse is unique with Jeffers. He doesn't mind doing it, he doesn't worry about lines so long they have to double back twice (as several in the poem I have been focussing on): And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the howling first-blast that we were born from. ("The Great Explosion") The line easily becomes a verset The lapidary goes by the board. His notion, like some herd of caribou migrating clean off the zone of the government park reserved for them, goes its way and keeps on going. Not that he isn't a phrasemaker, a devotee of the concise; he is, as a few phrases taken at random prove- "the prone ocean," "The honey of peace in old poems," "wet and worn out, like an old womb"- but that is his subordinate mode, and anyone casting around in his work (as I here) for a phrase that catches the idiosyncratic gist of the man finds the odds loaded the other way. It's easier to provide six-line chunks of autonomous-feeling ruminance. I mean the movement of his mind is toward amplification: to him an epigraph is a challenge to go on exploring, not an exploration summed up and irrefragably neat. His epiphanies are slow-motion ones. They don't zap you and pass, they hang around in the poem, unfolding and peeling, as in this: . . . our bones , ours too , would make Wide prairies white , a beautiful snow of unburied bones: Bones that have twitched and quivered in the night of love, Bones that have been shaken with laughter and hung slack in sorrow , coward bones Worn out with trembling, strong bones broken on the rack , bones broken in battle, Broad bones gnarled with hard labor ; and the little bones of sweet young children, and the white empty skulls, Little carved ivory wine-jugs that used to contain Passion and thought and love and insane delirium, where now Not even worms live. ( ' 4 Passenger Pigeons ' ') Donne is there, but also the American tradition's fondness in prose for successive ands (as if to make the sequential the simultaneous by making everything a list). What isn't there is the phrasemaker's willing- ness to gamble all on five-syllable blaze that announces Finis or 4 4 material exhausted." Jeffers in fact advances by feeding on what he has already put into the poem, and he doesn't hesitate to reach back over the terrain he's made in order to pick up a resonance, a tune, an epiphany that he's not quite yet treated in the round. If all this makes him sound laborious, I have done him a disservice. He spreads himself out because he is utterly at home with the imagery of science and doesn't take line after line to domesticate the stuff; it's there in his gut and brain, and he doesn't feel self-conscious about it. He knows the size of Antares ("The Earth's orbit doubled would not girdle his greatness") and works it into the poem as part of the natural gait of his mind. And he understands the life-cycle of stars, as he indicates in "The Treasure," after a dash that has no subsequent partner (which means the nonparenthesis just fans out and out): Short-lived as grass the stars quicken in the nebula and dry in their summer, they spiral Blind up space, scattered black seeds of a future. . . . The spiral there is just as natural for him as "the wild spirals of the wind- dance" to which the north-west wind is "wakening" tlÄ¼e wings of the "old gray, sea-going gulls" in "Birds." This poet, as each and every line makes copiously clear, is utterly at home in a universe he admires for its persistence, although he resents its ability to go on using his detritus long after he is dead (he'd like a clean and final end, with nothing left). I'm not saying he achieves a perfect harmony, but he does rise to an accommodation more comprehensive than you find in most twentieth- century American poets. His mind is ultra-permeable. He isn't quite sure where the line of division is between what's in his head and what isn't (can a pantheist have dichotomies?). And he perceives in the most con- tributive manner imaginable, without ever seeming to labor, to grind, to breathe heavily. He has almost no humor, of course; I imagine it's because a mind so holistic is ill-attuned to the absurd, and what he does PAGE 16 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">find absurd- the technological suicide of homo sapiens- he is too busy denouncing to find ludicruous. It's as if some almost extinct network of nerves survives in Jeffers, the housing of an atavistic skill we may well need to teach ourselves all over again. His world is his and ours as well, more than ours is even ours. Jeffers is obviously not a poet of categories; instead he is a poet, per- haps even the poet- of suffusion, gamut, and total spectrum. "Erase the lines:" he writes in "Monument," "I pray you not to love classifica- tions." Use them if you have to, but don't convert them into a fetish. The thing is like a river, from source to sea-mouth One flowing life. We that have the honor and hardship of being human Are one flesh with the beasts , and the beasts with the plants One streaming sap , and certainly the plants and algae and the earth they spring from Are one flesh with the stars. The classifications Are mostly a kind of memoria technica, use it but donyt be fooled. ("Monument") Of course, it is one thing to be told this, to accept it, and quite another to feel it, to achieve his own extraordinary sense of the concurrance of things. He himself can feel it only by downplaying the human role in the scheme of things, as if being born human were merely a convenient means of acquiring enough intuition to put mankind in its lowly place. Time and again Jeffers reminds us how marginal we are, how trivial; the Earth will "flourish long after mankind is out" (note the image of the inning) and "Man's life's/Too common to be lamented." Such a chasten- ing view requires of its proponent a sense of expendability that applies to his own work too, and Jeffers has it in abundance. He seems less intent on converting readers to any large view of his than on scratching his wit- ness on some available rock and leaving things at that. How impersonal he can be: as conduit, as a reflex from the human sensibility per se, not from that of Robinson Jeffers in particular. As a result, his poetry could have been a mere catalogue, a bill of goods, an anonymous primer in humility; but it isn't, mainly because, whatever he professes on the level of rational, discursive thought, he is idiosyncratic enough to come through anyway: the magistral, plane-spotting, star- watching, ancestor- hunting recluse with a knack for twisting what's taken for granted into a didactic device. Let me pursue this a little further. In the epic writings, he twists the notion of incest to signify that the human race is too much involved with itself. It's not a matter of local taboos having to do with consanguinity; it's a matter of cosmic decorum, having to do with our minor place in the league of things. In fact, his incest implies narcissicism or masturbation, and only in the delirium of self-engrossed passion can we sustain the fiction of our own importance. It is a view found elsewhere, in the pÃ²ems of Aldous Huxley, for instance, but mostly an unpopular one because it junks the glad humanism of the Renaissance, flouts some of the cherished precepts of democracy, and bypasses the view held by certain religions that the individual is paramount. In effect he says that the "good life," "the pursuit of happiness," et cetera, are beside the point, as is the idea of the absurd, predicated as it is on unjustifiable assumptions about the universe, the galaxy, the solar system, nature, chemistry, the lot. What Edna St. Vincent Millay called the "terrific implications" of his, poetry dismiss both nihilist and hedonist, not because deep down Jeffers doesn't care about the quality of the individual life- his own, his wife's, his granddaughter's, but because he has a grand-mindedness which transcends everything else. So, while he can write of his grand- daughter Una, . . . that light red hair of hers Is the fuse for explosions . . . (Granddaughter") his mind invokes other things, especially "the beauty of transhuman things" (italics mine). It is not one view shoved into another's place; it's the view that underlies and complements all views, maybe akin to the wise passivity of Wordsworth, but altogether more bristling with the cy tological and the galactic. And its effect on the reader is similar, per- haps, to that of the blood-sacrifice images in his longest poems: eluding logic rather than transcending it, working on the mind when the mind doesn't know. It's a bit like getting a sunburn while being asleep outside or receiving the message of an ad subliminally. It can be domesticated, tamed, through recourse to such phrases as Keats's "negative capabil- ity" and D.H. Lawrence's "blood-consciousness," but it is just about unique to Jeffers, who has different ways of putting it, most famously "Permanent things are what is needful in a poem, things temporarily/Of great dimension," but also, with persuasive subtlety, through the tex- ture of a poem itself when he implies, as ever, that human begins too are "temporarily/Of great dimension" in the poem of life. His pageantry, then, is one of proportion, and his offering on th# level of "wisdom" is no bleaker, in the end no more consoling than George Wald's dictum that we are the Sun's way of thinking about itself. Readers wishing super- substantial nourishment must look elsewhere. Of course, the human mind being what it is, the more we break out of our humanity (as Jeffers recommends), the more it comes after us. The mode of breakaway reinstates us and the only gain- reviewed by Jeffers over the long run of history, done with censorious impartiality- is the self-knowledge that comes from a tradition of repeatedly failing to i assume a god-like stance. Inhuman as our race has tried to be, whether through Naziism or the Inquisition, through logarithms or the social security number; we have, nevertheless, humanized the non-human more than we have inhumanized the human. Those are the odds against which he sets his credo: "The pallid/Pursuit of the world's beauty on paper," which he finds "a pitiful pastime." All he can do is "write and be quiet." I must now confess that some of his long works, say Tamar ; Cawdor ; The Tower Beyond Tragedy , Thurso's Landing , have not worn well and, oddly enough, seem too humanized themselves, as if Jeffers had been trying to broaden, in terms both ephemeral and anthropomorphic, a vision better left in either of two forms: the medium-length poem, such as "Margrave," or the lapidary short-short, such as "To the Stonecutters." Perhaps the strain of being inhuman in tight, starched little poems, which have no other faces or voices in them, is too much. Perhaps we assimilate dogma best from dramatized lengthiness rather than from aphorism or proverb. Perhaps Jeffers felt that, talking to himself all the time in short poems, he was only committing his own specialized notion of incest! At any rate, he manufactured a good deal of soapy talk which no doubt appealed to a generation unready for scientific apocalypse. At random in Tamar I find: Lee, Lee, Come. He has come. " "What? Now, " he said. " I have told Lee. I was sick, he was sorry for me, he is going To camp tomorrow, he wants to see you and say good-by. " It does not exactly linger in the mind or provoke an impetuous lunge to the next few lines. Such lines may come into their own again when TV puts on Jeffers's talkier pieces; I cite them here only to suggest the other side of Jeffers who, not content with the mundane and the banal, makes club-sandwiches out of it in the interests of a flagellation scene or that of a head hammered to pulp. Why? Because "the beauty of transhuman things," intellectually more worthwhile than anything else, demands of the mind and senses, a self-denudation, a self-occlusion, impossible even for Jeffers who, irate over taxes, complains in the Carmel Pine Cone "I believe that the Carmel Sanitary Board is acting illegally. ... it is ridicu- lous to assess us more than six thousand dollars" (July 20, 1949) and who, on January 19, 1950 writes to Hans and Phoebe Barkan about Una's illness: Dr. Wolf son told me that his expectation when we brought her here was to operate low on the spine and cut the nerves of pain . . . but the x-ray pictures show other involvements higher up. The only other thing is lobotomy, but he doesn't propose it - nor do I. Such distractions as these, "Like insects back of a searchlight," de- mand his attention and remind him in his poetry of the principle of clash: the world as an arena of dissonance.

No wonder he developed a special kind of imagery with which to mimic this sensation; his common- place things are always extraordinary, eerie, startling. The evening is "leopard-footed." Old cypresses have "deep-sea knots." Decomposition begins to "pick and Caress the unstable chemistry/Of the cells of the brain." There are not many poets who can, in this way, metamorphose the hard times and heartaches of daily living into key-signatures of cosmic variety, but he does it with near-choreographic bitter-sweetness. These things said, one returns to the image of Jeffers as some kind of life-force, quietly overpowering everything within reach: He brings the world to focus in a feeling brain, In a net of nerves catches the splendor of things , Ä¼ Breaks the somnambulism of nature. . . . Yet he never exclaims "Man is magnificanti " or "What a piece of work is a man . . . ! " His work is less histrionic, less that of impresario than of a gentle ecumenical eroder who so much esteems "the splendor of things" that he falls into step behind sleepwalking nature itself, mesmerizing himself into a vicarious non-humanity. His only paradox, having tutored himself life-long in transhuman maneuver, is that quirky one of wanting total annihilation, much like burning your cosmic money before you go. His Browning-esque poem "Shakespeare's Grave" makes the point with chilling poignancy: Doggerel, " he thought , " will do for church-wardens, Poetry's precious enough not to be wasted, " And rhymed it all out with a skew smile: "Spare these stones. Curst be he that moves my bones- Will hold the hands of masons and grave-diggers. " But why did the good man care? For he wanted quietness. He had tasted enough life in his time To stuff a thousand; he wanted not to swim wide In waters, nor wander the enormous air, Nor grow into grass, enter through the mouths of cattle The bodies of lusty women and warriors, But all be finished He knew it feelingly; the game Of the whirling circles had become tiresome. " Annihilation's impossible, but insulated In the church under the rhyming flagstone Perhaps my passionate ruins may be kept off market To the end of his age. OÄ¶ a thousand years Will hardly leach, " he thought, " this dust of that fire. " Unless I misunderstand him radically, and in view of his re-insistences it's hard to see how, that is much the same as eating your transhuman cake and wanting it, too. Alas, the cake, no matter whose, drifts back into the universe, which it never left. In anyone else this craving seems forgiveable; in Jeffers, though, it seems almost a posthumous petulance, a truant moment from all that inhuman stuff. Mankind is not trivial enough. â </page></plain_text>
