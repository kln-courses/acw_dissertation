<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHER TAYLOR MEMORIAL LECTURE 2007 Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils At Home in Some Migratory Legend Types John Lindow ABSTRACT I argue that the tag "Pan legend" for ML 6070A/B is inappropriate and that a better tag might be "I must go, " and that there is no structural difference between the "troll" and "cat" versions. The type is one of those that might be called "home invasion" legends, in which a supernatural being lives secretly in the human community but is expelled; the other relevant types relate to changelings. KEYWORDS: legend, Pan legend, ML 607OA/B, supernatural being, changeling In 1922, toward the beginning of his long and illustrious career, Archer Taylor published an article?a short monograph really?on "Northern Parallels to the Death of Pan." Felix Liebrecht had been the first to point out such parallels (1856: 179-80, esp. fn. 26), and Wilhelm Mannhardt and others had followed this lead (Mannhardt 1877:132ff ; see 1915a, 1915b, 1916 and Wassmann 2003:1-33 for research history). All those scholars regarded the few German legends that Liebrecht had pointed out as evidence of the diffusion of the myth of the dying god. The god who dies is of course in this instance Pan, and we know his death from a little narrative in Plutarch's De defectu oraculorum "The obsolescence of oracles," Chapter Seventeen (first century CE; Moralia 3:419b-e in John Lindow is Professor in the Department of Scandinavian at the University of California, Berkeley Western Folklore 69:2 (Spring 2010):163-179.

Put in the mouth of a certain Epitherses, Plutarch's story says that a voice called out three times from the island Paxos to a becalmed ship, addressing by name its Egyptian pilot, Thamus. When Thamus responded, the voice said: "When you come to Palodes, announce that the Great Pan is dead." When the ship was later becalmed off Palodes, Thamus carried out his commission, and the passengers on the ship heard many voices lamenting. To this may be compared the following little story from nineteenth century Denmark: Christen 0stberg, som var den fjerde mand, der boede, hvor S0ren Madsen nu bor, kom en aften med sild fra Nibe. Da han var n?et til Tisted mark mellem to sm? h0je, der nu er sl0jfede, kom der en lille ?n til ham og sagde, om han ikke vilde sige til Atis, at Vatis var d0d. Dengang han nu kom hjem og havde sat sig til bords og fik noget at leve af fortalte han, at da han kom til Hesselh0j, var der en lille ?n, som sagde til ham, at han skulde sige til Atis, at Vatis var d0d. Da blev der en jammer og grdd i stuen, og de rdbte: "A, Vatis er d0d, Vatis er d0dln Men der var intet at se. De boede under deres ovn. [Collected by Nik. Chistensen c. 1863 in Ellebjerg, Tisted sogn, Himmerland. D.F.S. IV 546. Boberg 1934:18] Christen 0stberg, who was the fourth man to live where S0ren Madsen lives now, was coming home one evening with herring from Nibe. When he had reached Tisted field, between two small mounds that have now been demolished, a little fellow came up to him and asked whether he would not tell Atis that Vatis was dead. When he got home and sat at table and got some food into himself, he recounted that when he came to Hesselfi0j, a little fellow told him he should tell Atis that Vatis was dead. Then there was weeping and wailing in the room, and they cried out "Oh, Vatis is dead, Vatis is dead." But nothing could be seen. They lived under the stove. [My translation, as throughout] It is difficult to see Vatis as a deity here, and Taylor's main aim was to break the connection between the myth of the dying god and such recent legends. He compiled 246 recordings, about half from German-speaking territories, the rest from French, English, Celtic, and Scandinavian traditions. In place of a diffusion of a myth of the dying god, Taylor argued that the modern legends derived from sounds made by the wind (1922:10-11). If this explanation seems tenuous, let us recall that it was not unusual for that era of folklore scholarship. Carl Clemen (1925), Inger Boberg (1934), Oskar Loorits (1937:10), and Martti Haavio (1938:126-28) accepted it or a variation of it, although</page><page sequence="3">Cats and Dogs, Trolis and Devils 165 more recently William Hansen referred to it, deep in a footnote, as "odd" (2002:135, fn. 22). More importantly, Taylor was the first to enforce a distinction between legends in which the message passes between anthropomorphic characters, as in the Danish story above, and legends in which the message passes between cats. When she wrote on this well-known legend type, Inger M. Boberg followed Taylor and called her monograph Sagnet om den store Pans d0d [The legend of the great Pan's death] (1934)?although of course she adduced no recent legends with Pan?and the name quite naturally has stuck. Patricia Lysaght's entry in the M?rchen Enzyklop?die is called "Pan ist tod," and Hans-J?rg Uther actually changed the name (and slightly altered the plot summary) of AT113A "King of the Cats" to ATU 113A "Pan is Dead" (Uther 2004:84). On the other hand, in his migra tory legend catalog, Reidar Th. Christiansen assigned the type as a whole the number 6070 and called the anthropomorphic and cat subtypes, respectively, "Fairies send a message" (6070A) and "King of the cats" (6070B). Putting aside the ubiquity and hence utility of the tag "Pan Legend," would we be better served with something else? In the first part of this discussion I will take up that question. I will then turn to the more basic issue of the distinction between anthropomorphic and cat subtypes, before finally attempting an analysis of the type from the point of view of legend tradition, primarily through adducing other types of a similar structure that I hope will throw light'on this one. I will base my discussion on the Nordic recordings, especially from Denmark, since Boberg (1934) has catalogued them so thoroughly. Boberg uses the Danish text quoted above as an example of her first subtype within the anthropomorphic category. The similarities to Plutarch's story are obvious, and William Hansen, departing from a very similar German recording, recently constructed a five-point scheme to show that "[t]hese are certainly forms of the same story" (2002:133): (1) someone calls out to a traveler making his way past a certain place, (2) asking him, when he comes to a particular site (Palodes/home), to report that so-and-so is dead. (3) Although the man does not really understand the message, (4) he does report it at the specified place, (5) whereupon a lamentation made by unseen beings is suddenly heard. Whether one accepts these as forms of the same story will have to do with the degree of stringency one requires in constructing types. While the similarities are undeniable, some significant differences present themselves as well. Putting aside the nautical environment in the Ionian</page><page sequence="4">166 John Lindow Sea and the greater distances that a ship can travel, as opposed to land travel on the Jutlandic heath, there is the fact that Palodes is not home, but a point on shore opposite to which the message is to be repeated. In other words, the ship is not yet in port but must go on, whereas the Danish man has completed his journey. In addition, the treatment of names is different: while the invisible voice in Petrarch knows the name of the man who is to pass along the message, namely the Egyptian pilot, Thamus, the invisible voice in Danish (and other Nordic legends) sel dom names the messenger but almost always gives the name of a specific person to whom the death announcement should be made; and the name of the deceased echoes or rhymes with this name: "Tell Atis that Vatis is dead, Tell Biltser that Baltser is dead, Tell Hikke that Hakke is dead." In a few cases, in fact, the invisible speaker also identifies him self: "Send Bulter's greetings to Bilter, and tell him that Baiter is dead" (Boberg 1934:27). Beyond this somewhat different treatment of nam ing, there is the fact that the announcement of the mysterious death in Danish tradition leads, as in our little story above, to information about those who respond to it ("they lived under the stove"), a feature quite absent from Plutarch. In fact this information amounts to an identifica tion, as we shall see. The biggest difference, however, is lamentation. Lamentation appears to be an essential feature of Plutarch's story, even if we do not associ ate it with the myth of the dying god. But although it is present in the recent recordings generally adduced to illustrate the "Pan legend," it is in fact not all that common. Analysis of Boberg's first main type and the subtypes attendant to it will underscore this point (Boberg 1934:14-32). Here is a brief summary: Type AI AJ 1 Atis and Vatis + Lamentation AI 2 Biltser and Baltser + Lamentation AI 3 Hikke and Hakke + Lamentation Al 4 Pig and Pjag + Lamentation or theft of beer Boberg follows Taylor's division into two main groups, which she calls the "troll" group and the cat group. Here we are looking at her first type, AI, which I will call the "Simple Troll type." As you can see, Boberg divides the subtypes primarily on the basis of the names used (here too she is refining Archer Taylor), and in fact she is able to show relatively clear geographic distribution for the four subtypes. The story quoted above</page><page sequence="5">Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils 167 falls into the simplest subtype, the one corresponding most closely to the Plutarch story: AI 1 Atis og Watis + Lamentation. Subtypes AI 2 and AI 3 differ primarily in the names used: AI 2 Biltser og Baltser + Lamentation and AI 3 Hikke og Hakke + Lamentation. The fourth subtype has the names Ate and Date and either theft of beer?I shall have much more to say about that important issue?or lamentation. Taken together these subtypes constitute the base type of the Nordic Pan legend, although for Boberg All is the putative original (Boberg 1934:102). Boberg cites by my count some 85 variants within her four subtypes of the "simple troll type" AI. Of these, lamentation is explicit in only about 30 or so, far fewer than half. This count is approximate, since some of the recordings are very short, and others are ambiguous at this point, but it is obvious that lamentation is no more than an optional feature in the Danish legend tradition. Sometimes the story simply ends with the passing along of the message. More frequently, in about fifteen recordings, the response is merely "Oh, is So-and-So dead?" without any indication of lamentation or other response to the message. In about the same number of recordings, the respondent says "then I must leave," sometimes after "Oh, is So-and-So dead," sometimes in an if-then struc ture ("If So-and-So is dead, then I must leave"). In one recording the supernatural beings express not sorrow, but joy, for the deceased had oppressed them. Indeed, the feature of lamentation is no more persis tent in this simplest sub-type within Danish tradition than is the feature of the departure of the supernatural being or the recognition by the humans that a supernatural being had been living with them. Pan and the lamentation for him are even less relevant to the Norwegian variants. In his migratory legend catalog, Reidar Th. Christiansen pos tulated as follows the type 6070A "Fairies Send a Message," of which he found about 70 recordings (Christiansen 1958:183-88): ML6070A. Fairies send a message It happened at a certain place (Al ), a farm close to a hill where fairies were supposed to be living (A2) that at Christmas time (Bl) the supply of beer was constantly diminishing (B2). Somebody (Cl) was then given a message to deliver at the farm as he was passing by a certain place (C2), or the message was shouted from the hill (C3) asking the messenger to tell (C4) that... (C5) had ... (C6). Having delivered the message, a fairy suddenly became visible or was heard (Dl), or fled, leaving behind her a bucket, etc (D2). As evidence, the object is still preserved (E). Before leaving, the fairy woman asked the housewife to attend to her cows while</page><page sequence="6">168 John Lindow she herself was absent for an announced burial (F), and in return she was given a gift (F2). Christiansen's summary of the type does not even include lamentation. It would occur at point D, which gives the response to the delivery of the message: a fairy suddenly became visible or was heard (Dl), or fled, leaving behind her a bucket, etc. (D2). In fact, a perusal of Christiansen's brief summaries of the Norwegian variants does turn up lamentation in nine legends, with no particular distribution that I can discern?two in southeast Norway, two in Telemark, one on the south coast, four on the west coast?except perhaps for a complete lack of lamentation in Tr0ndelag and Northern Norway, that is, in the northern regions as opposed to the southern regions. This distribution contradicts to some extent Boberg's statement to the effect that the type "that ends with lamentation" (her words; our "simple troll type") is found in the "northernmost part of Norway?Sogn and S0ndfjord, as well as Telemark" (1934:66). These areas can only be taken to be the northernmost part of Norway if one uses a medieval map, but it is indeed true that Christiansen found four of the nine variants with weeping in Sogn og Fjordane. I cannot give similarly firm numbers for the Swedish recordings, but Boberg found that the Norwegian and Swedish versions were very similar. Indeed, in the types that Boberg postulates as typical for Norway and Sweden the question is somewhat moot, since the person who dies is usually the child of a troll who is stealing from a human household. My first conclusion is thus that the Scandinavian legends taken to be analogous with Plutarch's story of Pan generally lack the fundamental feature of lamentation for the death that is reported, and that we might well dispense with the tag "Pan legend" for them. Older scholarship, with its emphasis on exploring the age of folklore traditions, ignored the data in order to create a link with a classical narrative. What the "simple troll type" is about is shown by the last sentences of the sample story Boberg used: "But nothing could be seen. They lived under the stove." Invisible beings living under the stove are of course trolls, taking the term broadly to mean supernatural nature beings. Plutarch's story uses a human messenger to provoke lamenta tion in nature; the recent legends use a human messenger to reveal the presence of a troll or trolls in the house. Sometimes the being is directly identified as a troll, and sometimes the inference is easy to make, as with a tiny little man, or a woman who can heave her breasts</page><page sequence="7">Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils 169 back over her shoulders. Sometimes the narrators comment on the identification: "In the house were mound folk {bjcergfolk) of Vatte's family" (Boberg 1934:18). "They were terrified, both the man and the woman; before that they had never had any idea that they had such strangers [living there]" (Boberg 1934:20). "Now they understood, that the mound dweller (bjcergmanden) lived with them" (Boberg 1934:22). "And from this they understood that they had the trolls (troldpakket) in their own house, and they moved their farm for the same reason" (Boberg 1934:28). Thus, in Nordic tradition, the invisible lamentation and other invisible responses, such as rumblings or other noises, are simply narrative methods to indicate what is, as I have indicated, the point of the story: humans learn that trolls have been living in their house. One of these trolls tells the family while he is leaving: 'You mustn't be afraid of me; I've lived here with you for years" (Bobert 1934:28). This may sound reassuring, but having trolls in the house then was bad. Another narrator said: "They had some idea that they [trolls] were there, for they always lost a cow from the stall" (Boberg 1934:17). In any rural society, such a loss would be a nearly insurmountable problem. I intend to argue that there is little fundamental difference, in Nordic tradition, between the troll versions and the cat versions. To do so I must first say more about the troll versions, and I will do so following Boberg's typology. Her second major type of the troll group, to which she gave the tag "Beer theft and old bucket," differs from the "simple troll type" primarily in the ending of the story, after the point when the human announces the death. Here is the story Boberg uses to typify it: En often k0rte Rasmus Andersen, der havde vceret med i "attenarskrigen " (1709 20?), forb? Drageh0j ved R0nnebcek, og da han var toet ved den, Ji0rte han, at det r?bte inde i h0jen: "A, si til Ade, at Dade er d0d. " Da han kom op i H0jegdrden, fortalte han, hvad han havde h0rt, og da h0rte han et r?b oppe fra storstuen: "A, erD. d0dln Sa l0b de derop og sd da en lille trold, som sprang ud af stuen og glemte en stor messingkedel, han var ved at tappe 0l i af det anker, som Id rede til gcesterne. [Collected c. 1854 by Franziska Carlsen at R0nnebaeksholm, Praest0 Amt, Sjselland. Boberg 1934:32-33.] One evening Rasmus Andersen, who had taken part in the "eigh teen-year war" (1709-20?), rode past Drageh0j ["Dragon-mound"] by Ronnebsek, and when he was right by it, he heard someone call out in the mound: "Oh, tell Ade that Dade is dead." When he came to H0jeg?rd, he told what he had heard, and then he heard a cry from up in the main room: "Oh, is Dade dead?" They ran up there and saw a little troll, who</page><page sequence="8">170 John Lindow ran out of the room and left behind a big brass kettle he had been drain ing beer into from the keg that had been waiting for the guests. Boberg characterizes the variation within this subtype as follows (Boberg 1934:32-46): Type All All I Ate and Date + Theft of beer and bucket left behind All 2 Vitti and Vatti + Thwarted brewing All 3 Sortoje and Vipping + Theft of beer and bucket left behind All 4 King Pippe + Theft of beer and beaker left behind All 5 Skotte has fallen into the fire + Theft of beer and bucket left behind This summary of the subtype makes clear what the trolls are doing in the human household: they are "borrowing" beer, as some informants put it explicitly. Subtype All 2, which is limited to the island of Sams0, reverses the issue; there the humans cannot brew beer until after the supernatu ral beings have run off at the announcement of the death in the other world. In many cases the supernatural being rushes off so quickly that she or he leaves behind an old bucket or a beer tap. The bucket or beer tap left behind is typical also of the Norwegian and Swedish recordings (Boberg 1934:66-97). Here, however, there is a clear regional variation, since the supernatural being who dies, far from being an analogue to Pan or some other dying god or a random troll in a mound, is a troll child who is accidentally burnt in a fire or falls into a kettle. When the troll parent hears this sad news, he or she rushes off and leaves behind the evidence of the stealing. Usually this is a theft of beer. Again Boberg classifies the various subtypes on the basis of names; what interests us most here is one version of the name of the supernatural being who rushes off, found in Halland, Sm?land, and Vasterg?tland: V?rtasnugga (wort parasite) and variants thereof (Boberg 1934:71-75). Now, beer can stand in for food, and its importance in daily life may be captured in the medieval and later Danish expression "Food and beer" when we would now say "Food and drink" (Kjersgaard 1978). There was a time when people could pay taxes with beer, and beer was an important trade commodity in the Baltic and North Sea from the Middle Ages onward. Beer was also important on feast occasions, as words such as grav0l "funeral" (lit. grave-beer) show, and thus when trolls stole beer, they threatened the proper celebration of passage rites</page><page sequence="9">Cats and Dogs, Trolis and Devils 171 like funerals, marriages, and the like, as well as the high holidays of the Church, in which beer also figured. I now turn to the cat versions. Christiansen assigned type 6070B to such legends but could locate only two Norwegian recordings. The cat-versions are also rare in Sweden, but they turn up rather frequently in Denmark, in about a fifth of the recordings, according to Boberg (1934:53), and they are, of course, very common in England, Ireland, and France. Archer Taylor (1922) had suggested that the anthropomor phic-cat distinction accompanied a second distinction, one between lamentation and joy. According to this idea, trolls grieve and cats rejoice when the message of death is delivered, and this should constitute a basic difference between the two subtypes. A reading of the actual Scandinavian recordings, however, suggests that the joy of the cat is no more central than the lamentation of the trolls. Boberg adduces nine teen recordings of the cat-version from Denmark, among which I find joy in only two?and this joy can only be read out of the statement "Now I am King of the cats." I also find two texts with sorrow: one in which the cat shrieks (which perhaps it often did?), one in which it states that it will never see its husband again. In the overwhelming majority, the cat just says: "I must leave," and we are left?as so often with cats?to guess at what the cat is thinking. "I must leave" is also what the trolls say most frequently. The core of the legend, whether the being who departs is a troll or a cat, is thus an announcement of a death in the world of the supernatural beings, which triggers the departure of a previously invisible troll, or of a cat. Does it matter which? I am now pleased to invoke one of the many important contributions made by Archer Taylor's successor in the Folklore field at Berkeley, Alan Dundes. Dundes called it the principle of motif ernie equivalence, that is, two motifs in the same structural slot must have a common meaning (Dundes 1962 and 1984). By this logic, the cats and trolls in the legends are equivalent. To allow nineteenth-century Danish voices to make that point, I quote two very short recordings. The first was made by Svend Grundtvig in 1861 in Stillinge, western Sjselland, from Christian or Christen Stenbaek, then twenty-two years of age: R?b p? Ncesby mark: "H0r du, Klat, sig til din kat, at Knuyrremurre er d0dl" "Hvad er K. d0d!" kat bort. Fra den dag af sa elkr h0rte man aldrig noget til troldene der i garden. [Stillinge, Boberg 1934:57] A shout at Naesby field: "Listen, Klat, tell your cat that Knurremurre</page><page sequence="10">172 John Lindow is dead." "What, is K. dead?" Cat away. From that day on no one saw or heard trolls there on the farm. For Stenbaek it was clear that the cat was in fact a troll. So too for the Bornholm high school student who told this story to his teacher, J. Kamp, in 1875: Lille kvindefra Tilsh0j: "Sig til din kat, at Til er d0d!" Till0boende kat bort: "Er T. d0d, sa m?jeg skynde mig hjem!" Nu vidste folkene, at det var en trold, de havde huset. [R0nne, Boberg 1934:57] A little woman from Tilsh0j ["Til's mound"]: "Tell your cat, that Til is dead." Stray cat away. "If Til is dead I have to hurry home." Now the people knew that it was a troll they had taken in. Why this equivalence? My explanation is based on the very strong Danish focus of the cat versions in Scandinavia. This I would associate with the fact that all of rural Denmark was characterized by villages or large manors as opposed to the single farms that typified nearly all of Norway and much of north ern Sweden. This must mean that the cats in question are house cats, pets, rather than cats that live on the farm and contribute to the well being of the farm by killing mice in the barn. Hidden trolls and cats, then, overlap in that they live in the house hold and eat, but do not provide food or do other work. To show that the amount eaten by a house cat could in fact generate narrative, let us consider R Chr. Asbj0rnsen's version of the cumulative tale known in ATU as type 2028 "The devouring animal that was cut open," which he collected in Telemark in 1847 (Asbj0rnsen and Moe 1936:265-70, with amusing illustrations, translation in Asbj0rnsen and Moe 1960:161-67). It's the story of a house cat who eats so much that she is kicked out of her home after one last small meal. On the road, those whom she meets ask her if she has eaten. "Just a bit," she says, "and now I will eat you." The menu is pretty impressive: she eats the bowl of porridge and some lard, the man of the house, the woman in the barn, a cow in a stall, a man cutting branches in a meadow, a weasel on a stone pile, a squirrel in a grove, Mikkel the fox, a hopping hare, Grayleg the wolf, Byskopp the bear cub, his mother Bisk, a big male bear, an entire wedding pro cession, a funeral procession (including the corpse), the moon, and the sun. But a big billy goat butts her off a bridge and she bursts, whereupon everything she has eaten emerges intact. In his catalog of Norwegian folktales, 0rnulf Hodne lists thirty-five</page><page sequence="11">Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils 173 recordings of this humorous tale (1984:336-38), occasionally with a man or a mouse as the subject, but mostly with cats. The recordings are all from the south and southeast of Norway, areas where one might expect to find more house cats than barn cats. In the more northerly area, with fewer villages and a greater predominance of single farms, there are no recordings of this folktale. If cats are trolls and trolls are cats, the end-motifs of the stories dis cussed so far, those following the message delivered at home, are four in number (more than one may be present in any given story and there are a few recordings in which none is present?that is, which end simply with the delivery of the message): 1. A supernatural being has been living in the human household 2. The supernatural being must leave 3. It is revealed that the supernatural being has been stealing beer or preventing the brewing of beer 4. A token of the stealing is left behind I take the first two together: A supernatural being has been living in the human household, and that being must leave. The basic plot of the legend, then, is one of getting rid of trolls. This is one of the more com mon plot sequences in European rural legends, and it fulfills the very basic narrative structure of a disruption of the status quo (trolls in the house) followed by the restoration of the status quo (trolls gone from the house). Some legends, such as the Bear-Trainer and the Trolls (ML 6015 "The Christmas Visitors," also classified as ATU 1161), make clear the prob lems trolls present on a farm: they threaten to kill people, make a racket, eat all the food, and prevent the humans from celebrating Christmas properly. Our legend presents the opposite situation: there is a troll in the household, but the people are not aware of his or her presence. Despite this lack of awareness, the troll's presence harms the human community, for the troll is explicitly a thief, mostly of beer (end motif 3). In The Bear Trainer and the Trolls, the trolls mistake the bear for a kitten and elect not to return next Christmas. In our legend, a message causes their departure. The particular issue here is a hidden troll-thief, a hidden drain on a household's resources. In my view the closest analogue is the change ling, according to legend tradition an old troll who, like the troll or cat in our legends, sits around eating and contributes nothing. Scholars have interpreted folk beliefs about changelings as attempts</page><page sequence="12">174 John Lindow to explain children who suffered from various maladies. Many of these maladies resulted from malnutrition (myxedema, marasmus), and we may infer that many changelings ate normally but did not show normal development. Others suffered from maladies that made them obese, as rickets occasionally could. The social reality was that changelings ate but did not work. The explanation for such a case as an exchange car ried out by the supernatural beings was a natural result of this reality, consistent with other notions of the supernatural beings as threats to the human community, not least to its food supply (Lindow 2008). The narrative mechanisms of changeling legends resolve the issue of uncer tainty about a non-contributing member of the household by revealing his identity?just as the message of a death in the supernatural com munity reveals the concealed presence of someone in the household who is eating but not working, or is stealing food. Both legends banish the supernatural being from the household. That the two legend types are in dialogue is suggested by the fact that two versions of the name of the troll who rushes off after hearing of a death (Wati and Vaddis) are also attested as the names of changelings in Danish tradition (Boberg 1934:25). These names are found in legends in which the changeling is being taken to be baptized and speaks, thus revealing his identity. For example, when Wati the changeling is accosted by a voice calling out from a mound asking him, by name, where he is headed, he says: "I'm going to the sladderi-ding-dang to become a better child" (Tang Kristensen 1892:325). He might have added what his namesake Wati the invisible troll would have said: "Now I must leave the household forever." Indeed, the changeling who speaks on the way to baptism is to some extent the mirror image of the "I must go" troll legend. As Eoghan Rua O'Neil points out discussing the Irish versions of the King of the Cats, the legend has two scenes, one out in the countryside, where the super natural voice shouts out the message of a death, and a second scene in the home, where the message is repeated and the cat speaks and leaves. In the changeling legend there is an implicit first scene at home ("In a certain place there was a changeling") and the crucial second scene outside, where again an invisible voice calls out, here directly to the changeling, prompting the identity-revealing response (O'Neil 1991). Let us pause for a moment to consider just how frightening these legends are. One expects to meet trolls and the other supernatural beings out in nature, not at home. Home should be safe and secure. For this reason, I think, the supernatural being who belongs at home, the brownie (nisseor tomtein Scandinavian), usually is instantly recognizable</page><page sequence="13">Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils 175 by his tiny stature and old-fashioned or bright red clothing. If a troll, who, almost by definition should be outside in some distant place, can be inside the house, nowhere is safe. Whether we read this in Durkheimian or Eliadean terms of a dichotomy between sacred and profane, or not, the fact remains, I am persuaded, that the fear of the outside, or the Other, coming inside was sufficiently palpable in Nordic legend tradition that it manifested itself in, or gave birth to, several leg end plots of which the supernatural message was just one. Together we might term these types the "home invasion" legends. We have considered several types of "home invasion" legends involv ing the supernatural nature beings, but the world of religion was also involved. Another extremely unwelcome visitor was Satan. We all know of the card players and the devil (ML 3015), in which someone looks under the card table and sees Satan, sometimes in the form of a big black dog, very rarely in the form of a black cat with cards in its paws (Christiansen 1958:27, recording IV 9). Satan also liked to show up at the moment a sinner died, frequently again in the form of a dog, or something rather like a dog, sometimes too as a cat. The effect is the same: the animal is a mysterious creature with whom communication would indeed be unwise. These visits are more than a little unsettling, and sometimes it is difficult to get Satan to depart; many legends involving a Satanic visit end with Satan only finally leaving as the result of an exorcism. I would argue that these exorcisms of Satan are structurally equivalent to the moment when the troll or cat leaves the human household after learning of the death of some supernatural being with a strange name, when the changeling departs, or when the trolls agree not to return next Christmas. Exorcism is a performative speech act, and speech reveals the changeling. In the legends I am considering today, the supernatural beings, like changelings, also frequently reveal their troll identity by speaking for the very first time. But speech is important beyond that parallel. It is the message from the supernatural beings, delivered by a human, who is himself generally the principal victim of the stealing, that prompts the revelatory speech of the secret sharer and his or her subsequent departure. This speech, then, resolves the situation. From the logic of legend tradition as a whole, we can perhaps recall Christiansen's summary of ML 6070A, ending as it does with part F: "Before leaving, the fairy woman asked the housewife to attend to her cows while she herself was absent for an announced burial . . . , and in</page><page sequence="14">176 John Lindow return she was given a gift. ..." This structure of the legend is quite rare: found only in Oppland in Eastern Norway and Sogn og Fjordane on the west coast, and even more rarely in Denmark. However, it suggests that the legend can be about good relations between the supernatural and human worlds. The human does a favor for the supernatural beings by delivering their message, and she or he is rewarded by the departure of a supernatural houseguest and the cessation of the theft of beer. Indeed, in a few versions of the text, there is a reward beyond this, such as a sack of money left behind. Occasionally, too, the King of the Cats gives thanks to the human commoner before departing to take up his royal duties. But why should the message be about a death in the supernatural world? If we think in terms of good relations, letting someone know of a death so that she can attend the funeral would fall into that category. This seems common in the Irish versions, but not in the Nordic ones, where the departure is in essence permanent. Some informants seem to have thought about this question, and they motivate the presence of the troll in the human world through some event in the supernatural world. A troll got into a fight with another and had to leave the mound; when he hears of the death of his enemy he can go home. But the simplest explanation in the rural communities where these stories were told is most likely the fact that certain deaths change things. A man working as a farmhand might inherit land after his father's death, or a woman work ing as a servant might be needed at home after the death of a female relative. And perhaps we can say on a more universal psychological level that some deaths make it impossible to go on living in a given space. Looking at the problem from another angle, we may wonder whether any death in the world of the trolls may not be a good thing for the human community. With this in mind I turn to end motif 4, the empty tap or bucket left behind by the supernatural thief. Such tokens are very typical of interaction between the human and supernatural communi ties, and one migratory legend type has grown up around the idea: The Drinking Cup Stolen From The Fairies, to which Christiansen assigned type no. 6045: challenged to offer a man a drink, the trolls give him poison; he pours it out and escapes with the cup. In this encounter, and in other legends in which a token enters the human community, the interaction between the two communities is agonistic, and the human being barely escapes from the threat posed by the supernatural being. Thus our legend seems to involve possibilities of good relations with the trolls and bad. Bad relations come to the fore in those versions of the legend that</page><page sequence="15">Cats and Dogs, Trolls and Devils 177 end with the troll (in Scandinavia) or the cat (outside Scandinavia except for one anomalous recording in Iceland (Boberg 1934:99-100)) killing the man who brings the message. Here we appear to be far from the desirable outcome of ridding the house of trolls and even farther from good relations between the humans and supernatural beings. It is certainly true, as I have said above, that trolls in the house always pose an implicit threat, and we know from life that sometimes implicit threats lead to explicit undesirable outcomes. However, it turns out that recordings that end with the troll kill ing the human messenger are actually extremely rare in Scandinavia. Boberg makes of them a third type of the troll group. She cites only eight Danish recordings, all from southern Jutland, and of these, in fact, only three have the killing (interestingly, she finds no recordings of this type just south in Schleswig-Holstein or anywhere else in the German speaking area (Boberg 1934:102)). The others are simply stories exactly like the ones I have been discussing, in which the announcement of a death from the mound prompts a troll to leave the household. In the three with the killing, the killing is motivated: the man who brings the message has killed someone in the mound; the name he is to tell at home is that of the victim; the secret sharer is related to the victim. Here we have quite a different message: be careful about throwing knives or rocks into a crowd of trolls. That makes sense to me. The division between "revenge" and "non-revenge" versions which O'Neil uses for the Irish recordings is fully motivated. I conclude: the Nordic so-called Pan legends are not about Pan, or about lamentation or joy, or about the King of the Cats, or for that mat ter about vengeance. It will no longer suffice simply to organize them, as Boberg does, by the names relating to the deceased and recipient of the message or even by the biological species of the being to whom the message is to be conveyed, even though there are clear patterns of geo graphical distribution associated with both. My contention here is that a close reading of the Nordic recordings themselves has shown them to number among what I have termed "home invasion" legends, that is, legends that express a fear of supernatural beings invading the usually safe space within the household, often with the negative effect that one would expect, expressed as a threat to the supply of food and drink. In place of the tag "Pan legend" I suggest that we call them, as I did above, "I must go" legends; I take the name, of course, from what the troll says in reaction to the message conveyed from the invisible voice. Like other "home invasion" legends, the "I must go" legends end by</page><page sequence="16">178 John Lindow offering reassurance, in that the supernatural threat is countered, as it should be. The mechanism of that counter is verbal: a message from the mound enters the household, just as the troll did, and that message reveals the presence of the troll. Once revealed, the troll says what it must: "I must go." WORKS CITED Asbj0rnsen, P[eter] Chr[isten], andj0rgen Moe. 1936. Samlade eventyr, Norske kunstneres billedutgave, vol. 2.
