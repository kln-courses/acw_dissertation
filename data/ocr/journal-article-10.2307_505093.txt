<plain_text><page sequence="1">The 90th General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and the First Joint Archaeological Congress On 5-9 January 1989, the 90th General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America was held in conjunc- tion with the First Joint Archaeological Congress in Baltimore, Maryland. The Congress, the first event of its kind in North America, was sponsored by the Archaeological Institute of America, the American Philological Associa- tion, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Society for Historical Archaeology. The purpose of the Congress was to unite archaeologists in an effort to transcend geographical, chronological, and disciplinary boun- daries and address the broad philosophical and methodological questions raised by the study of past cultures. The joint sessions of the Congress addressed the following subjects: Archaeology and the Past; City Planning: Overviews and Case Studies; Ethnicity and Chipped Stone; Landscape Archaeology: Case Studies; Graphic Docu- mentation in Archaeology; Shipwrecks; History of Archaeology: Mainstreams and Margins; Expansion and Con- trol: Cross-Cultural Approaches to the Effects of Territorial Expansion in Complex Societies; Materials Analysis: Contents of Vessels; Landscape Archaeology: General Considerations; Politics and Power in Archaeology; Collect- ing and the Role of Museums in Archaeology; Continental Shelf Research, Prehistoric and Historic Resources; Archaeology and the Public I: Education and Perception; Diet and Food I: Trace-Element, Isotope, and Faunal Analysis; Colonization: Cross-Cultural Perspectives on the Colonization of the Frontier; Ethnicity and Ceramics; Archaeology and the Public II: Education and Perception; Current Issues in Archaeological Theory and Method; Archaeology and the Text: Interaction between Text and Artifacts; Publishing I: Challenges and Innovations; Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction; Underwater Archaeology: Recent Explorations; Death and Burial I: Physical and Cultural Implications; Colonization: Acculturation and Trade; The Modern Image of Ancient Egypt: The National Endowment for the Humanities and Archaeology; Ships of Exploration and Discovery Research; Ethnic- ity: How are Groups Recognized?; Publishing II: The Purpose of Excavation; Death and Burial II: Physical and Cultural Implications-Old and New World Perspectives on Mortuary Practices; Current Developments in the Archaeology of Inundated Terrestrial Sites; Archaeology in the Future; U.S.S. Monitor; Landscape Archaeology: Settlement Patterns and Environment; Diet and Food II: Cultural Implications; Archaeology and Politics; and Field Conservation. Abstracts of the papers presented in these Congress sessions, together with those of the sessions sponsored by the individual societies, were published in a booklet available in Baltimore; the booklet may now be purchased from the AIA's office in Boston for $12.00, postage included. Only the abstracts of the papers presented in the AIA and joint AIA/APA sessions are printed here. They are preceded by the citations read on 7 January 1989 by James R. Wise- man, President of the Archaeological Institute of America, when he presented the Institute's Gold Medals for Distin- guished Archaeological Achievement to John Desmond Clark and Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, and by Lawrence E. Stager, Vice President of the Institute, when he presented the Pomerance Award of the Archaeological Institute of America for Scientific Contributions to Archaeology to George R. Rapp, Jr. The texts of the four papers presented at the Congress plenary sessions will be published in the next issue of AJA. 243 American Journal of Archaeology 93 (1989)</page><page sequence="2">244 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT JOHN DESMOND CLARK John Desmond Clark is most succinctly, if incompletely, described as one of the world's foremost interpreters of early cultural development as well as one of the most prolific writers on the subject. His research on Palaeolithic and later Stone Age cultures has taken him to such diverse areas as Central Africa, Sudan, Ethiopia, the Sahara, India, and the Near East. His contagious enthusiasm for archaeology has given encouragement to younger col- leagues and students, numbers of whom are now established scholars in their own right. A superb fieldworker, he has also always been able to envision the more complete fabric of ancient lifeways as represented by the jigsaw puzzle composed of fragmentary bits of evidence surviving from the Pleistocene and early Holocene: the "bones and stones" that many less astute observers might regard as all but mute testimony to the past. He was one of the first archaeologists to emphasize the importance of ecological factors in structuring or tempering the behavioral re- sponses of evolving human societies to their respective settings, and routinely one of the first to appreciate the significance of new techniques and methods, and of interdisciplinary approaches, designed to aid interpretation of the archaeological record. Desmond Clark graduated from Cambridge in 1937, on the eve of World War II, and soon thereafter accepted a post at the Rhodes-Livingstone Museum in what was then Northern Rhodesia. After a brief period, during which he initiated a research program that included describing the geological and cultural stratigraphy of the nearby Victoria Falls area, he left to serve as an officer with British forces in East and Northeast Africa. For most indi- viduals this would have been a largely unproductive interlude, but he made the most of an extended opportunity to carry out archaeological fieldwork in Ethiopia and Somalia during such free time as was at his disposal. The results of his survey provided the basis for a postwar doctoral dissertation at Cambridge, which was subsequently pub- lished as not his first but second book. Returning to Livingstone after the war, he resumed his position at the Muse- um where, as Director, he built it into one of the leading research institutions in Africa. His own single most impor- tant research effort was at Kalambo Falls, excavating deposits that incorporated a 200,000-year succession of prehistoric remains, from Acheulian through Iron Age. He also found time to work on other projects, including a fairly extensive archaeological survey in northeast Angola. In 1961 he left the Museum, with understandable feelings of regret, to become Professor of Anthropology at Berkeley. His absence, however, was only temporary since he went back to Africa frequently, and on occasion worked in Asia, in order to pursue his Old World interests. It has been at Berkeley that he has influenced so many young people to follow in his footsteps. This was a new role for him, and one of inestimable value to the field of archaeology because of his direct involvement in the training process, a function largely denied him as a museum director. Perhaps of greater importance than the more tangible, which is to say published, results of an unusually active and productive life is the person himself: an indefatigable fieldworker, a dedicated and demanding scholar, a gentle- man of the first magnitude, and an individual invariably displaying a keen interest in the work of others. His pro- fessional career has spanned a half-century during which has emerged most of our knowledge concerning Africa's contribution to human evolution. It is with the greatest respect and admiration that the Archaeological Institute of America presents its Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to Desmond Clark.</page><page sequence="3">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 245 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT BRUNILDE SISMONDO RIDGWAY Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, distinguished authority on Greek sculpture, the Archaeological Institute of Ameri- ca is proud to honor you for your outstanding accomplishments as inspiring teacher, exciting lecturer, eminent scholar, careful editor, and, above all, friend. Born in Italy and raised, in part, in Ethiopia, Brunilde Sismondo took her Italian doctorate at the University of Messina. She received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College, where she wrote her dissertation, Observations on Style and Chronology of Some Archaic Sculptures (1958). She attended the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (1955-1957), during which time she excavated at Phaistos. She has taught at Bryn Mawr College since 1957 where she now holds the Rhys Carpenter Professorship of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology and has served as Chairman. In addition, she has been Andrew Mellon Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Pittsburgh (1978) and Elizabeth Whitehead Visiting Professor at the American School of Classical Studies (1988). Further, she has participated in two NEH Summer Seminars, directed two Summer Sessions of the Ameri- can School (1967, 1971), and has led AIA study tours to Sicily (1971) and North Africa (1974). For eight years she donated her time as Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Archaeology while maintain- ing full-time teaching duties. As Editor she worked tirelessly to ensure the best product possible. Her honors and awards are numerous; she has held fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies and the Guggen- heim Foundation, and has been a member at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and the National Gal- lery in Washington (CASVA). In addition, she was invited by the Georgian Academy of Sciences, USSR, to speak at their Fifth International Symposium, and has just presented the 12th Felix Neubergh Lecture at the University of G6teborg, Sweden, the first woman awarded this honor, which carries a silver medal. As a teacher, Bruni Ridgway has that rare ability to motivate, excite, nurture, and criticize, always with good cheer and encouragement. It would be impossible to list here the many students whose honors papers, M.A. theses, or Ph.D. dissertations she has advised, or the growing number of former students who have become members of the academic community. What is significant is the importance students have for her and what her concern does, in turn, for them. Further, she has readily given lectures for other institutions, the AIA, and the centennial celebration of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The most tangible contribution, however, lies in her publications. Her books, rich in bibliography and thought- provoking ideas, include: The Severe Style in Greek Sculpture (1970); Classical Sculpture, Catalogue of the RISD Museum of Art (1972); The Archaic Style in Greek Sculpture (1977); Aspects of Ancient Greece, with Gloria Pinney (1979); Fifth Century Styles in Greek Sculpture (1981); Roman Copies of Greek Sculpture: The Problem of the Originals, Thomas Spencer Jerome Lecture Series (1984), the lectures at the American Academy in Rome and the University of Michigan (1981-1982); and The Porticello Shipwreck, with Cynthia Eiseman (1987). Her study of sculptures of the third century is forthcoming, and revised editions of the books on Archaic, Severe, and fifth- century styles, which have become standard texts, are in progress. Her many articles and countless reviews have appeared in distinguished international journals and she has contributed to numerous symposia and festschrifts. She has offered new insights and different points of view on widely ranging subjects: from Herakles to Ptolemy VI; from "Ladies" from the sea to Apollo, Warriors, and now possibly Chiron; from men with dogs to Amazons with belts; and from techniques of carving stone and casting bronze to metal attachments. Most important, she has caused her readers to look again, to reconsider traditional views, and to approach evidence with new questions and new methods, especially in the difficult analysis of classi- cistic sculptures of the Roman period. In addition to all her scholarly activities she has managed also to be a wife and to raise four fine sons. We salute her, honor her, and wish her many fruitful and happy years to come. In recognition of her outstanding contribu- tions, the Archaeological Institute of America awards its Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achieve- ment to Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway.</page><page sequence="4">246 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY GEORGE R. RAPP, JR. George R. (Rip) Rapp, Jr., personifies research at the interface between geology and archaeology, an interdis- ciplinary field of fundamental importance to our understanding of the archaeological record. Through numerous reports on archaeological geology involving sites in Greece, Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, and Tunisia, he has been instrumental in popularizing the application of a wide array of scientific techniques to archaeological prob- lems throughout the Mediterranean. These research efforts have been combined with an active teaching career at the University of Minnesota, which has itself cultivated a group of researchers committed to following his example of enriching archaeological understanding by means of physical scientific methods. Rapp, who was granted the B.A. degree in Geology and Mineralogy from the University of Minnesota in 1952, and the Ph.D. from the Pennsylvania State University in 1960, had decided on a career in academic research, centering on high-temperature geochemistry. He began this promising work at the South Dakota School of Mines (1957-1965) and continued it at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis) Geology Department in 1965. Involvement in an exotic research field such as archaeological geology requires a creative response to the lure of a new and untapped field of inquiry. In Rapp's case, it was his meeting in 1965 with William A. McDonald, Direc- tor of the Minnesota Messenia Expedition and 1981 recipient of the AIA Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement, that diverted him from conventional geological research. H.E. Wright, the 1984 recipient of the AIA Science Medal Award, already was working on questions of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Bronze Age Messenian vegetation and climate based on pollen analysis. Rapp soon realized that another useful contribution to archaeological reconstruction could be made by studying the lithic materials and the sedimentary sequences at sites such as Nichoria, as well as by applying established techniques in sedimentology to determine local palaeogeo- graphic change. The publication in 1972 of The Minnesota Messenia Expedition: Reconstructing a Bronze Age Regional Environment (University of Minnesota Press), as a solid example of the utility of interdisciplinary re- search, helped to lure many graduate students to the new Center for Ancient Studies, and to collaborative projects in archaeological geology with Rapp. Rapp's commitment to interdisciplinary teaching at the graduate level is exemplified by the Center for Ancient Studies at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities), which he cofounded with McDonald in 1973; he has super- vised seven theses and three dissertations in the Center, and regularly teaches courses in archaeometry and archaeo- logical geology for the Center's students. His Archaeometry Laboratory on the Duluth campus of the University of Minnesota is used for graduate research projects in trace-element provenance studies, phytolith studies, prehistoric archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean, Holocene coastal change, and environmental archaeology of prehistoric sites in the upper Midwest. Rapp's publications in archaeological geology total some 36 articles and five edited volumes, coauthored or edited with numerous colleagues, many of whom are former graduate students in geology or archaeological geology. Rapp's unique talents center on his ability to sense promising avenues of research, his innate organizational, administrative, and fund-raising skills, and his exceptional productivity in terms of projects and publications. The archaeological community is indeed fortunate that he has devoted his research interests and energies to addressing, and often resolving, its questions by means of geological methodologies, and it seconds the feelings of the geological community in honoring him with the Pomerance Award for Scientific Contributions to Archaeology.</page><page sequence="5">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 247 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION II-N: PTOLEMAIC CONQUEST AND INFLUENCE OUTSIDE EGYPT: THE HEL- LENIC RESPONSE THE PTOLEMIES IN THE PAPHOS DISTRICT AND ON CY- PRUS: Frederick A. Winter and H. Arthur Bankoff, Brooklyn College, City University of New York Cyprus, long of interest to Ptolemy Soter, formally be- came a Ptolemaic possession in 294 B.C. following a period during which control of the island was contested with the Antigonids. The island remained under Ptolemaic rule until 58 B.C. when it was incorporated into the expanding Ro- man Empire. The Ptolemaic capital of the island was initially located at Salamis-Arsinoe on the east coast; it was shifted to the port of Nea Paphos on the island's southeast in the second century B.C. This paper concentrates on the role of the Ptol- emies within the Paphos district, an area that not only in- cludes the extensive archaeological remains from the dis- trict's urban and religious centers, Nea Paphos and Palaipa- phos, but that also was the focus of a comprehensive regional survey conducted between 1979 and 1986 by David Rupp and his Canadian Palaipaphos Archaeological Survey. Thus, the Paphos district provides data to test the degree to which the Ptolemies influenced Cyprus and, more generally, their overseas territories. Some major features within the Paphos district show clear signs of Ptolemaic influence. The architecture and burial practices evident in the so-called "Tombs of the Kings" at Nea Paphos are virtually identical to those known from Alexandrian cemeteries. Other Hellenistic developments within the district pro- vide more ambiguous evidence. To what extent, for exam- ple, was the initial urban growth of Nea Paphos, a site founded by a native dynast who was an ally of Ptolemy Soter, influenced by the early Ptolemaic interest in the site, its excellent harbor and the island as a whole? Similarly, Rupp has documented expanded settlement within the Pa- phos district during the Hellenistic era. Was this a result of direct Ptolemaic influence or a reflection of more general processes of mercantile prosperity around the eastern Medi- terranean during the last centuries B.C.? Such questions lead generally to concerns regarding the relationship be- tween archaeological data and unique politico-historic events, and specifically to questions regarding the degree to which a characteristically Ptolemaic subassemblage may be distinguished within the broader Hellenistic koine. THE PTOLEMAIC BASE AT KORESSOS ON KEOs: Jack L. Davis, University of Illinois at Chicago, and John F. Cherry, University of Cambridge IG XIII.5, 1061 honors Hieron, son of Timokrates of Sy- racuse, Ptolemaic epistates resident at an Arsinoe, for his good will and aid to citizens of the polis of Karthaia on Keos. Paul Graindor, its first editor, argued (BCH 30 [1906] 97) that Arsinoe was to be identified with the polis of Koressos in the northwest corner of the island. His conclusions, bol- stered by Louis Robert's further observations concerning the suitability of Koressos as a port for a large fleet (Hellenica 11-12 [1960] 132-73), have subsequently gained wide ac- ceptance. Koressos is considered to have been a "major Ptol- emaic base.., .renamed Arsinoe, probably by Patroklos during the Chremonidean War" (e.g., R.S. Bagnall, The Administration of the Ptolemaic Possessions outside Egypt [Leiden 1976] 141-42). The great bay of Ayios Nikolaos on which Koressos is sited would, indeed, have provided an ex- cellent location for quartering a fleet destined for mainland theaters of operation. Robert predicted that the renaming of Koressos would have had substantial consequences in the material record: "... il y a n6cessairement fait construire des installations, telles que m6les, magasins, agora du port, murailles, sans doute aussi des sanctuaires, qui ont dfi profiter largement ' la ville, la transformer ...." Archaeological evidence that might evaluate this hypothesis has, however, been almost entirely ignored (J.L. Caskey, Koroni and Keos [Hesperia Suppl. 19, 1982] 14-16, is an exception), despite the fact that the polis center of the presumed Arsinoe has been the scene of several investigations in the course of the present century. The recent completion (1983-1984) by the authors of an archaeological surface survey of northwest Keos af- fords, therefore, an opportunity to review for the first time all data pertinent to the identification, duration, and charac- ter of a Ptolemaic base on the island. Systematic surface collection at the polis center and in its territory, and the results of less extensive excavations are by and large in agreement: there is little reason to believe that the Ptolemies invested great resources in tile maintenance of a powerful base on the island and the Egyptian occupation of Koressos is not reflected in obvious charges in the material culture of the polis. Relevant epigraphical texts do not, moreover, point to a strong continuing Ptolemaic military presence on Keos in the decades after the Chremonidean War. The base at Koressos, although short-lived in compar- ison to that on Thera, may, however, have had lasting reper- cussions for the organization of the political and economic life of the island. The center seems to have been reduced in size and there was almost certainly a substantial drop in population throughout the entire city-state-a trend that continued in the succeeding century and culminated in the total collapse of Koressos as a viable population center and as an independent polity. THE PTOLEMAIC BASE OF METHANA: Lin Foxhall, University College, London, Christopher Mee and Hamish Forbes, University of Liverpool, and David Gill, Fitzwilliam Museum The small, volcanic peninsula of Methana, situated in the eastern Peloponnese, served as an important Ptolemaic base under the name of Arsinoe. Methana has also been inten-</page><page sequence="6">248 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 sively surveyed by a team of archaeologists from the Univer- sity of Liverpool since 1984. Ptolemaic presence may be discerned in several ways. Some building and construction is most likely attributable to Ptolemaic influence. The Ptolemies apparently encouraged religious activity, not only promoting native Egyptian cults (Sarapis and Isis), but perhaps also indigenous deities (Po- seidon Phytalmios). The relationship of the Ptolemaic occu- piers to local elites is more difficult to determine from the available evidence. Thus, their effect on the distribution and use of agricultural and other resources, as well as on settle- ment patterns, is often unclear. This is complicated by a major eruption of the volcano during this period. However, it can be ascertained that Methana's relationships with neighboring city-states changed substantially. Ironically, Methana's occupation probably resulted in her increased power and independence within the region. Methana's con- tacts with other parts of the Mediterranean were also sig- nificantly affected. This is one of the few periods in which Methana emerges from the shadow of the periphery. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PTOLEMIES IN THE CY- CLADES: Gary Reger, Trinity College, Hartford Examination of the impact of Ptolemaic control on the Cycladic economy usually starts with Delos as a clearing house for Ptolemaic grain (M. Rostovtzeff, The Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World [Oxford 1941] 230-33; Robert, REG 94 [1981] 230). The slim evidence, however, does not prove whether Ptolemaic grain moved through Delos regularly. In the 280s three or four islands received foreign judges sent through Ptolemaic officials (IG XXI.5, 1065; 5.7 + Suppl., p. 96; IG XXI.7, 14-15 + Suppl., p. 142). Delian estate rentals show an economic collapse in 297-290 B.C. (Kent, Hesperia 17 [1948] 243-338). The dispatch of judges may be connected to a general economic crisis, not the Ptole- maic takeover. Other evidence for economic effects is slim. Regular taxa- tion is unproven despite an oikonomos for the islands (IG XII, Suppl. 169) and occasional crowns (SIG3 390; IG XII, Suppl., p. 111). Ptolemaic coins are rare (e.g., I.D. 372B58- 59; EAD 27 [Paris 1970] 412ff; IGCH 204, 226). Cycladic trade goods arrive in Egypt infrequently in the Zenon papy- ri (P.Cairo Zen. IV.59548, cf. 59110, 59547; 59704). The Ptolemies confined long-term intervention to areas they garrisoned. Discharged soldiers on Samos require spe- cial regulations for the Heraion (AM 87 [1972] 210-25, no. 9). Thera receives dikasts in the 260s (IG XII.3, 320); in the second century land is confiscated for soldiers' benefit and the oikonomos may be stationed there (IG XII.3, 327, 466, 1390). The lack of Ptolemaic interest in the economy of the Cy- clades reflects the marginal importance of the region; control could be easily exercised through the Island League, and Samuel's recent study of the goals of Ptolemaic economic or- ganization suggests that the kings had no reason to interfere in a marginal but stable economy. THE PTOLEMIES AND CRETE: Sylvia Wartner, Kom- mission fiur Alte Geschichte und Epigraphik Cretan inscriptions, found in many cities like Eleutherna, Phalasarna, Rhithymna, Olus and Itanos, point to perma- nent relations with the Ptolemies in the third and second centuries. Many of these inscriptions are mutilated and have to be used with care. As to Ptolemaic methods of control or even domination, the situation in Crete is quite different from that in other Ptolemaic spheres of influence. There is no evidence for royal taxes, garrisons, or interference in in- ternal politics; only the city of Itanos was guaranteed its security by means of a Ptolemaic garrison. Most likely it was the Itanians themselves who had requested military aid against their neighbors. The nature of other relationships between the Ptolemies and Crete cannot be determined exactly. According to the literary tradition many Cretans are found serving as mercenaries in the Ptolemaic army. So it was probably as a source of mercenaries and as a strate- gically important naval base that Crete held attraction for the Ptolemies. This goal could be achieved without costly permanent control of the island. Only Itanos very early had a constitution similar to that of Athens, but it is not certain if that was a result of Ptolemaic control or influence. The political situation on Crete is characterized by the fact that the whole island was never handed over to the authority of only one power during this period. There were always vari- ous kingdoms, states, and leagues maintaining connections with Crete. Moreover, almost all Cretan cities changed sides, some of them even several times. Cretan mercenaries are often found fighting on opposite sides as at the battle of Raphia, 217 B.C. From this it follows that political and/or ideological manipulation either was ineffective or, more probably, was never intended. It is even doubtful whether the Ptolemaic presence in Crete caused any widespread so- cial, economic, demographic or cultural change. It is possi- ble that the continuous export of mercenaries led to a reduc- tion in Cretan piracy, which had resulted from overpopula- tion and lack of food supplies. Cretan cities, on the whole, were able to preserve a relatively large measure of indepen- dence by maintaining diplomatic relations with most of the foreign powers, but they were eventually forced to acknow- ledge the everchanging configuration of power. SESSION II-O: DARK AGES IN THE OLD WORLD: PERSPECTIVES AND PROBLEMS AN EARLY "DARK AGE" IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT: INSIGHTS ON THE BASIS OF COMPLEX SOCIETY: Ste- ven E. Falconer, New York University The term "dark age" often is applied to intervals of ap- parent socioeconomic collapse in the archaeological record. These intervals are assumed to result from disruptions, ei- ther natural or cultural, in the expected growth and devel- opment of human societies. The rise of cities in the southern Levant during the third and second millennia B.C. (i.e., the Early and Middle Bronze Ages) is punctuated by a "dark age" of non-sedentary pastoralism ca. 2300-2000 B.C. (i.e., Early Bronze IV). Past research has emphasized the perva- sive abandonment of towns and cities, and the disappear- ance of sedentary agrarian life. However, more recent exca- vations and surveys, particularly in the Jordan Valley, high-</page><page sequence="7">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 249 light an unexpected abundance of Early Bronze IV seden- tary agricultural settlements. Further, neutron activation analysis of ceramics from several sites in the Jordan Valley suggests centralized pottery manufacture, despite the ab- sence of substantial towns. Rather than representing the aftermath of urban collapse, these data describe a pattern of diversified rural society that persisted through the periodic rise and fall of cities in the southern Levant. Thus, the "dark age" of Early Bronze IV actually illuminates two larger ar- chaeological implications: 1) Many early complex societies may represent extinct forms of society, for which we lack modern analogs. For example, we cannot simply assume "urbanism" to have been normal in all early complex socie- ties, or its disappearance to signal dark ages of collapse. 2) Dark ages merit continued attention, not simply as cata- strophic episodes, but as they help reveal the basic founda- tions of early complex societies. THE GREEK DARK AGES: DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: William D.E. Coulson, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The past 10 years have witnessed a great increase in our knowledge of the Greek Dark Ages, both through excava- tion and individual study. The time has come, however, for us to consider the recent evidence in light of new archaeolog- ical theories and practices, especially those which attempt reconstructions of regional environments. A recent book by KAre Fagerstr6m, Greek Iron Age Architecture: Develop- ments through Changing Times (G6teborg 1988), attempts just such a critical reexamination through a study of archi- tectural changes. It is a valuable study in that it brings to- gether a diverse array of information, but it also underscores the inherent weaknesses which currently exist in studies of the Greek Dark Ages. The work attempts to relate changes in architecture to developments in societal and economic patterns. The latter, however, can only be studied with ade- quate evidence from, for example, palaeozoological, palaeo- ethnobotanical, pedological, or geological sources. Remote sensing, or the use of satellite photography and its data, is another technique which could provide evidence for land use patterns and developments. Yet, such sources have been rarely used in Greek Dark Age archaeology, and their lack of use makes any attempt at environmental reconstruction only partial. In light of the above restrictions, therefore, it is vital for new research into the Dark Ages to concentrate upon envi- ronmental studies, so that we may form as complete a pic- ture as possible of life in those supposedly difficult times. Such studies need not take place in conjunction with excava- tion. They may also be part of survey projects or of individ- ual research. If excavations must take place, then it may be advisable to restrict them to small sites which have the possi- bility of providing for the total recovery of all types of evi- dence. In this way the environmental picture of the particu- lar region in question may become as complete as possible. THE "OTHER" DARK AGE: ARCHAEOLOGY AND EARLY BYZANTIUM: Timothy E. Gregory, Ohio State Uni- versity In recent years archaeology has played an important role in reassessing the Dark Ages in Western Europe (e.g., Hodges and Whitehouse, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe). Nonetheless, no such reevaluation has been forth- coming for the equally complex phenomenon in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although the concept of the "World of Late Antiquity" has now become fashionable, and historians are attempting broad reconstructions of the sixth through the ninth century, archaeologists have generally steered away from the question, leaving others to use archaeological evi- dence in a simplistic and often misleading manner. This paper examines the theoretical problems inherent in exami- nation of the Byzantine "Dark Ages" and traces the various ideological concerns which have dominated archaeological work on the period. Adopting an explicitly comparative frame, the paper discusses the applicability of archaeologi- cal methods used in other parts of the world for the Eastern Mediterranean and suggests new approaches for several old problems. The paper points to the lack of fundamental work in various areas (e.g., ceramic typology) and concludes by discussing new evidence from Greece and the Balkans that holds out the promise of elucidating this still dark age. THE BYZANTINE FORTRESS AT ISTHMIA, GREECE AND CONTINUITY FROM LATE ANTIQUITY TO THE MEDI- AEVAL PERIOD IN THE AEGEAN: P. Nick Kardulias, Youngstown State University Conventional views of the transition from Late Antiquity to the Early Byzantine era often characterize the shift as a period of urban decline during which the erosion of the Classical polis reduced once grand cities to isolated settle- ments devoid of large public works, a complex social hier- archy, and a monetary economy. Some scholars view these changes, placed between the fourth to seventh century A.C. in various areas around the Aegean, as harbingers of the Middle Ages. The present study supports a competing per- spective that there was a fundamental continuity in these centuries. The site of Isthmia in Greece is defined as an ur- ban outlier tied to the fate of its urban support system and thus a sensitive barometer of changes in the polis system. The site is discussed in light of recent geophysical and sur- face surveys that provide data relevant to the issue of this transition. The geophysical techniques reveal the presence of a variety of structures (large barracks, headquarters, a forge) and allow for inferences relating to the site's role in a regional settlement pattern and Imperial defensive strategy encompassing all of the Balkans. Mean artifact density and the diversity of material on the surface in the enclosure testify to the intensive occupation of the site in the fifth cen- tury and suggest a vibrant economy. A model of modified continuity is elaborated in which, despite certain changes in the nature of the polis system, Greek urban institutions sur- vived intact into the Early Byzantine period and beyond. THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN, A.D. 350-750: Da- vid Whitehouse, Corning Museum of Glass Between 350 and 750, the Western Roman Empire col- lapsed and a Dark Age occurred in the western and central Mediterranean. This paper asks questions about the magni-</page><page sequence="8">250 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 tude of the social and economic changes that accompanied the military and political disasters. It addresses three issues: the scale of production, interregional exchange, and the use of money for day to day transactions. Analyses of pottery-, brick- and glass-making reveal a marked decline in the scale of production. Discussion of the amphorae used as contain- ers for olive oil, wine, and other foodstuffs demonstrates an equally marked reduction in the volume of interregional ex- change. Studies of low-denomination coins suggest that money ceased to be used for small transactions. These con- clusions suggest that civilization collapsed in the western and central Mediterranean in the fifth and sixth centuries A.C. and that the period between about 550 and 750 should be regarded as a Dark Age, comparable to the Dark Age that followed the collapse of Mycenaean civilization in Greece. SESSION II-P: SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF MATERIALS WORKING WITH HINDSIGHT: INTERPRETATION THROUGH ILLUSTRATION: Bryan A.P. Alvey, Insti- tute of Archaeology, London The interpretation of archaeological sites can be ap- proached in a new, exciting and more efficient way using a new computer package called HINDSIGHT. Based on the principles of the Harris matrix and developed by the author, this customization of the AUTOCAD Computer Aided De- sign system can reconstruct composite plans from single- stratum drawings. HINDSIGHT can provide a strati- graphic check on data and create three-dimensional models showing the sequence of deposition of strata using single- stratum or composite plans as basic data. HINDSIGHT can access files output from other databases to color the strata according to specific aspects of data such as pottery and environmental material. This paper demonstrates the practical applications of this system to a range of sites, from complex urban stratigraphic excavations using single-stratum recording to rural excava- tions employing traditional composite plans. The paper dis- cusses how the system aids in both interpretation and dem- onstration, and improves the performance of archaeologists in their analysis for publication. NEW METALLURGICAL FINDS IN BRONZE AGE SARDI- NIA: Lenore Gallin, University of California at Los Angeles Excavations at Nuraghe Santa Barbara (Bauladu) have filled gaps in the poorly documented history of bronze cast- ing in ancient Sardinia. The western section of the 12th- century B.C. village surrounding this five-towered nuraghe has yielded clear signs of metallurgical activity: metal slag, terracotta crucibles with residues of molten metal, small lumps of bronze, and pieces of bronze artifacts. The most important finds are hundreds of fragments of fire-blackened clay molds and elongated clay plugs thought to have been used to make ornate bronze objects. The molds appear to have been one piece, broken in half after production. Some have decorative relief on their inner surface, others a num- ber of openings into which different sized plugs can be fit. Certain forms are so unusual that not only the function, but the very orientation of the object is unknown. Clay molds for casting in bronze have never before been found in Sardinia, although two-piece stone molds for blade production are known from the Nuragic period. In fact, pouring molten metal into stone molds is a perfectly ade- quate way to make functional objects. But to create pieces whose beauty depends on intricate design and detail, a Nu- ragic artisan may well have chosen to cast in a one-piece mold through the lost-wax method. It is thought that the kinds of molds found at Santa Barbara were also used to cast the mysterious bronze statuettes produced in Sardinia at the beginning of the first millennium B.C. To date, little is known of the origin and manufacture of these statuettes. Excavation in the slope of the hillside, where the village is more deeply buried, is expected to reveal the bronze foundry to which this metallurgical material belongs, and possibly the first smelting furnace ever found in a Nuragic context. ROCK CRYSTAL WORKING AT SARDIS: A LOCAL INDUS- TRY: Barbara Kelley McLauchlin, San Francisco State University Recent investigation of previously excavated material from Sardis indicates that rock crystal working was included among the local crafts and industries of the Lydian and Lydio-Persian periods. Working debris, in the form of crys- talline chunks, natural hexagonal crystals, and flakes of var- ious sizes, occurs in at least two areas of the site where other industrial and craft activities were located (e.g., gold refin- ing, bone working). Some of the larger flakes of rock crystal have at least one very sharp edge which appears to have been produced intentionally. Thus, rock crystal may have been used not only for luxury items but also for tools needed in other manufacturing processes, such as bone carving. Fin- ished products of rock crystal, several of which were recov- ered in contexts closely associated with the working debris, include an exquisite miniature bead in the form of a striding lion. Of particular interest are several "ear studs" or "lenses," similar to those found in quantity in the Archaic sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesos. The presence of such ob- jects at Sardis in secular contexts and the relative abundance of rock crystal working debris suggest that the Lydian capi- tal may have been a center of rock crystal production, espe- cially during the seventh to fifth centuries B.C. SAPPHIRES: EVIDENCE FOR TRADE WITH INDIA AND SRI LANKA DURING THE ROMAN PERIOD: Giraud V. Foster, Johns Hopkins University The production of gemstone jewelry during the first four centuries A.C. was accelerated by three historical events: 1) the discovery during the seventh century of methods to separate gold from silver, 2) the development of land trade routes to eastern gem sources as a consequence of Alexan- der's conquests, and 3) the triumphs in Rome during the first century B.C. that popularized high quality jewelry, es- pecially that from the Middle East. In this study we investi- gate a fourth event: the exploitation of the monsoon winds</page><page sequence="9">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 251 that made possible sea trade with India and Sri Lanka and the importation of precious stones as opposed to semipre- cious stones. Stylistic characteristics of jewelry were deter- mined from datable Egyptian mummy portraits; Sri Lankan sapphires in datable jewelry were identified by microscopic inclusions of lixivated water and fluorescence to long-wave ultraviolet light; and limitations of drilling and polishing without diamonds were proven experimentally. These stud- ies demonstrated that 1) rubies and diamonds are very rare in Roman jewelry, 2) the first sapphires imported were opaque stones most likely from south central India, 3) most sapphires after the second century came from Sri Lanka, and 4) to drill and polish sapphires, diamonds and the adhe- sive lac probably had to be imported from India. From these findings, it is concluded that some sapphires can be identi- fied as artifactual evidence of Roman trade with India and Sri Lanka and that this trade introduced diamonds and dia- mond cutting technology to the West. POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF OPEN POOLS OF OIL AND WATER ON CHRYSELEPHANTINE STATUES: William M. Gaugler and Patrick Hamill, San Jose State Uni- versity Pausanias (5.11.10) indicates that a pool of olive oil in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and a pool of water in the Par- thenon at Athens served to prevent the damaging effects, re- spectively, of high and low humidity on the ivory parts of the cult images of Olympic Zeus and Athena Parthenos. Classi- cal scholars have long wondered whether oil and water con- tained in shallow basins near gold and ivory statuary would, in fact, have had a preservative effect. To test these assertions a series of experiments was con- ducted at San Jose State University. Ivory strips glued to cedar were placed in environmental chambers simulating dry, hot, and cold, damp climates; some chambers contained pans of oil or water, others did not. A mathematical analysis was also made of the effect the pools of olive oil and water would have had on the relative humidity of the temple interiors, and calculations were made to determine whether or not the entire reflected image of the statues would have been visible to an observer stand- ing at the edge of the basin in each temple. From these experiments and calculations it may be con- cluded that the oil in the pool at Olympia had little or no effect on the preservation of the chryselephantine Zeus, while the water in the pool at Athens did benefit the gold and ivory Athena by marginally increasing the relative hu- midity of the cella, thus keeping the glue holding the ivory to the wooden core of the statue elastic. But in the moist envi- ronment of Olympia oil provided the more suitable reflective surface since it did not increase the relative humidity of the temple interior. Both the dimensions of the basins at Olym- pia and Athens and the reflective properties of oil and water confirm an aesthetic function. A RECONSIDERATION OF THE TWIST AND ETHNICITY RELATIONSHIP: Virginia Schrefler Wimberley, University of Texas at Austin, and William S. Dancey, Ohio State University This paper investigates whether the twist direction in yarn spinning is a viable indicator for tracing ethnic rela- tionships between prehistoric communities in the North American Woodland traditions. Previously this hypothesis has been investigated by studying textile-impressed pottery from archaeological sites without considering their specific spatial locations within the site. Generally all sherds from a site were considered as one assemblage: they were not subdi- vided by spatial locations such as individual features from within the site, but only by date. The Water Plant site (33-Fr-155), located south of the city of Columbus, Ohio, offered the unique opportunity to study textile-impressed pottery within the cultural, spatial matrix of the site. The site was subjected to two systematic surface collections from the plowed surface in 1980. Anal- ysis of the spatial distribution by Dancey indicated that the site was an enclosed village composed of at least 11 function- ally equivalent residential units occupied in the sixth cen- tury A.C. The sherds were found in a definite spatial rela- tionship which appeared to represent individual households with two other artifact types of stone flakes and discarded biface blanks. Specific questions addressed by the research were: 1) Within the individual household cluster, did one find both S (counterclockwise) and Z (clockwise) directions of twist and at what percentage? 2) Did the 11 residential units dis- play a difference in predominant twist direction for each clus- ter area and at what level of significant difference? and 3) How did the date from the Water Plant site compare to that of two other Ohio Late Woodland site sherd collections, housed at the Ohio Historical Society Center? AFRICAN RED SLIP: CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, PRO- DUCTION TECHNIQUES AND PROVENIENCE: James B. Gallagher, Carleton University North African potteries supplied the late Roman world with a monochromatic red-gloss table ware known today as African Red Slip or as terra sigillata chiara. During the apex of production between the fourth and sixth centuries A.C., enormous quantities of ARS were shipped to Mediter- ranean markets and beyond. Typological studies have ad- vanced considerably and these indicate that the Carthage region was a major source of ARS. Because there have been no previous archaeometric exam- inations of ARS from Carthage, a study was initiated to de- termine the chemical properties of this ceramic ware and to evaluate the potential for provenience studies based on fabric composition. This paper discusses the results of the investi- gation which utilized ceramics recovered during excavations in a domestic quarter of Carthage by a Canadian expedition. Several hundred samples, derived from a sequence of three securely dated deposits, were assayed for nine chemical ele- ments using a direct current plasma spectrometer. The abundances of major constituents have yielded new information about ARS manufacturing techniques. Sili- ceous clays were selected deliberately for making ARS. This implies that ARS manufacture did not evolve directly from the red-gloss pottery tradition elaborated in Europe by Roman potters producing Samian ware. When compared with certain physical characteristics, the composition of</page><page sequence="10">252 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 ARS also suggests that the firing procedures used at Car- thage varied significantly from those employed for making Samian ware. The ARS from Carthage exhibits a very homogeneous composition over a chronological span of three centuries. However, fabrics can be separated when data from spectro- metric analyses are subjected to discriminant analysis, a multivariate statistical procedure. Therefore, chemical com- position can provide a basis for provenience studies with ARS. Subgroups, isolated from the principal fabrics, may reflect fluctuations in the volume of ARS manufacture and changes in the local production mechanism. CERAMIC ECOLOGY IN RETROSPECT: A CRITICAL RE- VIEW OF METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Charles C. Kolb, Mercyhurst College The landmark concept of ceramic ecology, postulated by Frederick R. Matson in Ceramics and Man (1965), was de- rived from the methodologies of human ecology and cultural ecology, among others. Matson's contextual approach to ce- ramic analysis, originally conceived as a paradigm for Near Eastern archaeology, sought to place physiochemical and other natural scientific data into an ecological and sociocul- tural perspective by relating the technological properties of the raw materials to the production and use of the ceramic products. The original concept has undergone modification and elaboration, and has been utilized in the study of pot- tery-making and distribution systems in contemporary com- munities and societies, and in archaeological cultures in both the Old and New Worlds (for example, by Arnold, Kolb, Lackey, van der Leeuw and Pritchard, and Rice). Van der Leeuw and Pritchard observed that ceramic ecology has "provided a major impetus for ceramic studies during the past two decades." The contributions in Pots and Potters (Rice ed., 1984) demonstrate how the concept has been elab- orated, while those in The Many Dimensions of Pottery (van der Leeuw and Pritchard eds., 1984) reflect an assessment of the approach. Ceramic ecology has been the focus of three recent seminars, two published as A Pot for All Reasons (Kolb and Lackey eds., 1988) and Ceramic Ecology Revis- ited, 1987 (Kolb ed., 1988). These seminar papers demon- strate the impact of ceramic ecology on ceramic archaeology and technological analyses, replication and experimental studies, archaeometry, ethnoarchaeology, and the investiga- tions of contemporary potters and pottery-making commu- nities. Ceramic ecology has become a rather broad, frag- mented field of research but has "shattered some stereotypes and assumptions long held by archaeologists" (Kramer). Matson noted that his original goal was to "raise our ceram- ic consciousness on a world basis" through the application of this "holistic" approach. Ceramic ecology as a paradigm is diachronically reviewed and critiqued, and potential future orientations and modifications are suggested. SESSION III-U: CRETE ANALYZING EARLY CRETAN SEALS: A COMPARISON OF MESARA TOMB GROUPS: Ann C. Blasingham, Colby College Prior large-scale studies of pre-palatial and proto-pala- tial Minoan seals have examined material from the entire island as a body, stressing the homogeneity of motifs, tech- niques and materials throughout Crete. Thus, rigidly inclu- sive typologies have been established on the basis of gross resemblances, and as a result regional and temporal differ- ences have been obscured. Nevertheless, the determination of regional differences through time in seal carving would prove extremely useful not only for the history of that Mi- noan art, but also for tracing interconnections between sites and for rates and routes of culture change. That even micro-regional differences in seal carving can indeed be determined is shown by a new computer-assisted study of the seals from the Mesara tombs, which delineates details of carving techniques and their relation to material and motif in the Mesara. The seals were examined under magnification and analyzed individually and as tomb groups, only after which were all the Mesara seals and tomb groups compared. The comparison thus has revealed simi- larities and differences in motifs, techniques, and materials strong enough to suggest micro-regional clusters that endure through time within the Mesara Plain. The main clusters correspond to the natural geographic features of the Mesara, with the centers located at Aghia Triada, Platanos, and Koumasa south of the Geropotamos River, and Marathokephalo to the north. The seals from tombs to the south of the Asterousia Mountains may be re- lated with less certainty to the clusters surrounding Platanos and Koumasa. Anomalies within each cluster suggest con- tacts with other Mesara clusters and with other regions of Crete. THE VROKASTRO SURVEY PROJECT, PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Barbara J. Hayden, University of Penn- sylvania, and Jennifer Moody, University of Min- nesota at Duluth The Vrokastro survey project comprises a 50 km2 area surrounding the Bronze and Early Iron Age site of Vrokas- tro, located on the Bay of Mirabello, East Crete. The proj- ect's long-term goals are to reconstruct the region's different settlement systems for all periods and to place these systems in their appropriate environmental contexts. The area is limited by natural boundaries: the densely occupied coastline of the Bay of Mirabello forms the north- ern limit; the west side is defined by the Istron River delta and a deep gorge which extends to the village of Prina; the southern boundary is limited by the Meseleri Valley; and the Gourniapotamos River forms the eastern side. The re- gion is ecologically varied and extensively cultivated. Three important routes have been identified across the area, one along the north coast and two leading to the south coast. Survey methodology is based on division of these basic zones into smaller environmental and geomorphic units which are being sampled at 50%; data will first be analyzed by comparing units similar in terrain and ecology. Preliminary results indicate that Early and Middle Mi- noan sites appear placed primarily on low-lying hills. Set- tlements of all periods are located near the major routes. A Late Minoan I site has been found just northwest of the</page><page sequence="11">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 253 Vrokastro peak, and another may be located in the Istron River delta, now buried under deep alluvium. A fortified settlement of Early Iron Age date existed below Vrokastro on a coastal peninsula, and another contemporary site with large walls was located east of this peak. Early Iron Age, Orientalizing, and later pottery typifies settlements on a ridge overlooking the later site of Oleros in the Meseleri Valley. Possibly these communities and the Vrokastro pop- ulation moved down to more exposed areas in safer periods. Three years of fieldwork have greatly increased the num- ber of known sites in the region. More important is to deter- mine how these sites interacted with one another and their environment; this is the major goal of the Vrokastro survey project. EXCAVATIONS AT KAVOUSI, CRETE, 1988: Leslie Pres- ton Day, Wabash College, Geraldine C. Gesell, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and William D.E. Coulson, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Excavations at Kavousi again took place in 1988 at both the lower site on Vronda and at the upper settlement on the Kastro. Trenches were dug on the north and west sides of the Vronda hill to recover more of the plan and domestic assem- blages of the LM IIIC-Subminoan settlement. Many of the houses on the north had been disturbed by Late Geometric cist graves, which contained multiple cremations rich in pot- tery and metal. Further disturbance occurred in the Byzan- tine period with the construction of an apsidal building in one of the houses. The extent of the settlement on the north was determined by the discovery of a new tholos tomb, which had been thoroughly robbed; only a few bones and bronze objects survived from the burial. Exploration on the west side of the hill concentrated on Building I. One of its rooms con- tained a bench, an oven in the corner, and a hearth; pottery, a stone blossom bowl, and stone tools were found scattered as they were left when the building was abandoned. Investiga- tion on the southwest slope of the hill uncovered more frag- ments of terracotta statues and snake tubes deposited from a shrine. Building G was identified as the shrine when one of its rooms produced six complete snake tubes standing in front of a bench, along with kalathoi, plaques, and the torso of a goddess with upraised hands. Trenches to the north of the Vronda settlement at Xerambela have so far produced three rooms of a Byzantine farmstead dated by coins and pot- tery to the 13th century A.C. On the Kastro, terraces were explored on the east and west slopes of the peak and on the false peak to determine more of the plan and extent of the town, its history, and its relationship with the Vronda settlement. A new terrace with walls buried under deep debris was excavated on the east. Excavation along the west side of the upper settlement proved that the street or corridor identified by Boyd did not exist. Rooms continued west of Room 6, one of them con- taining a large oven or small kiln. Buildings also appeared on terraces down the slope to the west. More rooms of a large building with several phases of occupation were un- covered on the false peak to the west, including one room with whole vessels, many spindle whorls, and a hearth. Most of the excavated remains of the settlement are Late Geometric-Early Orientalizing in date, but Early Geomet- ric sherds have appeared in lower levels. Animal bones are providing surprising new information about the ancient en- vironment and the extent to which the people of the Kastro exploited their natural resources. THE CRETAN TEMPLES: Joseph W. Shaw, University of Toronto In the past, Cretan temple architecture has usually been treated only briefly and peripherally as a local style preced- ing the development of the columnar Greek temple during the Archaic period. The Cretan temples, however, belong to a largely independent and rich tradition that lasted for over 700 years, and merit special consideration on their own. A study of associated rituals is, naturally, equally important. Among some 30 examples of temples excavated through- out Crete, one discovers that there are two major temple types. The first, exemplified by the Late Geometric Temple of Apollo at Dreros, usually features an interior hearth with two columns on axis. This single room type, which contin- ued to be built for some time, was also enlarged by the addi- tion of an open or closed pronaos, as at Prinias in Temple A. Sometimes a third room was added on axis, as known from Phaistos. The second type, of which the Archaic phase of the Temple of Apollo at Gortyn is the earliest example known, is nearly square and consists of a single room. In the same tradition are the benched sanctuary at Aphrati and the first stage of the Archaic temple at Olous. ASPECTS OF RITUAL AT THE SANCTUARY AT KOMMOS: THE EVIDENCE OF VOTIVE FIGURINES: Maria C. Shaw, University of Toronto In the sanctuary of Kommos on the southern coast of Crete, where a series of three successive temples (A-C) span the period from the 10th century B.C. to the early first cen- tury A.C., one can follow the process of dedication and sacri- fice by the study of the artifactual and faunal offerings and their findspots. The present report concentrates on the vo- tive figurines in clay and bronze. Focal in at least the second and third phases of the sanc- tuary is a room with a central hearth which can be consid- ered a temple in terms of local Cretan tradition. Typical for the Early Iron Age phases is the deposition of figurines within the temples (A and B), but already in the seventh century some emphasis shifts outdoors with the construction of the first exterior altar. Hypaethral worship marks the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. after Temple B and the old altar had gone out of use and before a new temple (C) was built in the fourth century B.C. Votive figurines are from now on placed mostly in connection with the four altars lo- cated in a large court east of the temple and there is much evidence that this is now the focal area for sacrifice as well. The above preliminary report suggests that the Sanctu- ary and practices related to ritual and worship underwent developments. Particularly interesting in this respect is the contrast between the Early Iron Age temples and the Classi- cal temple.</page><page sequence="12">254 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 SESSION III-V: CRAFTSMEN AND CRAFTS- MANSHIP IN THE ANCIENT WORLD THE NON-COLLABORATION BETWEEN RHOIKOS AND THEODOROS: Virginia C. Goodlett, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Rhoikos and Theodoros are familiar to students of an- cient art as architects who collaborated on the Samian Tem- ple of Hera. This collaboration, however, is known only through a modern emendation to the text of Vitruvius VII praef. 12; no ancient source states that they were collabo- rating architects. In fact, Rhoikos and Theodoros are never mentioned together before Pliny. If one arranges the literary sources on their lives and works in chronological order, one gains unexpected insights into their careers and into the creation of literary biographies of artists. In Herodotos, Rhoikos is an architect, designer of the Heraion on Samos, and Theodoros is a skilled metal-worker who manufactured fabulous objects for Kroisos and Poly- krates. Their connection with one another is limited to a shared ethnic and to their independent associations with the Heraion, Rhoikos as architect and Theodoros as author of a book, perhaps detailing a technical innovation. Beginning in the fifth century Theodoros undergoes a mythicizing pro- cess. Plato lists him in the ranks of mythical artists, and he is credited by later writers with the invention of the arts and of the tools necessary to craftsmen. Rhoikos, who is never men- tioned separately by Hellenistic and Roman writers, is often listed as co-inventor with Theodoros, presumably on the basis of his shared connection with Samos and the Heraion; Rhoikos achieves near-mythical status through his associa- tion with Theodoros. Many of the more fantastic aspects of Theodoros's bio- graphy seem to reflect ancient theories of the history of Greek art and so should not be dismissed lightly. Innovative techniques and new systems of proportion were believed to have come to Greece from Egypt, probably via the eastern islands. Separating reality from fantasy in the careers of Rhoikos and Theodoros is valuable not only for the in- creased knowledge it brings to two famous early artists but also for the unusual opportunity it offers for clear observa- tion of the creation of an imaginary biography by attributing broad artistic developments to a historical figure. COLORED GLASS INLAYS IN ARCHITECTURAL ORNA- MENT: ATHENS AND RHAMNOUS: E. Marianne Stern, Toledo Museum of Art Color was an integral part of Greek design; numerous traces of encaustic painting survive on sculpture and tem- ples. Decorative elements in metal were stripped from both in antiquity, but early 19th-century travelers to Athens could still see colored glass inlays in the guilloche within the capitals of the North Porch of the Erechtheion (Stern, AM 100 [1985]). At the same time as the Erechtheion was constructed, Pheidias's pupil Agorakritos carved a statue of Nemesis for a temple at Rhamnous in northern Attica. Its base carries a delicately sculpted guilloche with three intertwining bands (Callipolitis, ArchEph [1978]; Petrakos, BCH 105 [1981]). This was a popular ornament in architecture. Its execution in Rhamnous, however, presents one signal anomaly: in- stead of convex elements at the intersections of the individ- ual bands, as is usual, there are circular bored hollows. The shape, size, and arrangement of these hollows are identical to those in the Erechtheion, suggesting that the hollows in Rhamnous were not intended to be seen but that they too were originally filled with colored glass inlays. Recognizing that hollows in a sculpted guilloche are evi- dence for polychromy in the form of colored (glass) inlays is important. The base of Agorakritos's statue in Rhamnous and the Erechtheion are the only monuments identified thus far as having had this type of decoration. Further research into the use of glass inlays in architectural ornament will establish whether it was more widespread than the present state of knowledge would seem to indicate or whether Rhamnous and the Erechtheion are isolated creations of a novel sculptural tradition. If the latter is true, the involve- ment of Agorakritos with the design of the Erechtheion should be considered. THE ECONOMICS OF ANCIENT SHIPBUILDING: J. Rich- ard Steffy, Texas A&amp;M University The ancient form of shipbuilding, the so-called shell-first method, is often considered to have been a more primitive method than later forms, in which permanent frames were erected before planks. Too often pre-Mediaeval shipbuild- ers are assumed to have been incapable of developing the frame-first method, which is frequently regarded as a tech- nological advance over earlier shell-first methods. I argue that this was not the case; shell-first construction was the natural result of a number of prevailing factors, the most predominant of which was the economic influence of the period. The very factors which most affected shipbuilding in the Mediaeval period and later-labor and timber-were not nearly so prohibitive to ancient builders. Consequently, the more labor-intensive and wasteful shell-first forms of construction were acceptable to ancient builders. Although shell-first construction is more limited in design variation, ancient ships were just as strong and serviceable as later ships within the realm of their intended assign- ments. Information gleaned from a variety of sources, in- cluding excavations, laboratory experiments, and the full- size sailing replica of the fourth-century B.C. Kyrenia ship, is used to develop and substantiate the arguments for the strong social and economic influences affecting ship design and construction in the Classical period and earlier. THE PTOLEMIES AND EARLY HELLENISTIC ATHENIAN CERAMICS: Susan I. Rotroff, Hunter College It seems likely that the introduction of moldmade Hellen- istic relief bowls ("Megarian" bowls) was inspired by the importation of fine silverware from Alexandria for the first celebration of the Athenian Ptolemaia in 224 B.C. But ear- lier Ptolemaic influence on Athenian ceramics can also be detected. A portrait of a Ptolemaic king, either Ptolemy I or II, appears in relief on the floor of two wheelmade, handleless cups from the Athenian Agora dating around 275 B.C. The</page><page sequence="13">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 255 portraits find parallels in Egyptian faience, and appear to be Attic versions of vessels that the Egyptians used in connec- tion with the Ptolemaic cult, founded shortly after the death of Ptolemy I in 282 B.C. Historical sources tell us that Athe- nian-Egyptian relations were extremely close in the years 287-260, when the Athenians repeatedly sent embassies to Alexandria, and the Ptolemies regularly dispatched gifts of money, grain, and even equipment for the celebration of the Panathenaia in return. Another reference to the Ptolemies is perhaps to be recog- nized on a kantharos of this period. Centrally placed on the vase is a double cornucopia, a form of horn invented by Ptol- emy II as a symbol of the fruitfulness of Arsinoe II, his queen from ca. 275 to 270. The grapes that flank the horn may refer to the Ptolemaic claim of descent from Dionysos. The inscription on the pot reads 4IAIA1, a common enough sentiment on the so-called grammatika ekpomata of the late fourth to mid-third century; here, though, it may have more specific reference to the special ties of friendship between Athens and Alexandria. A kantharos by the same painter found in Gordion is inscribed AQfPON, a much less common word in this connection, and may also refer to Ptol- emaic generosity. ALABASTER IN GREECE: Aileen Ajootian, Bryn Mawr College Around 300 B.C., artists in Volterra, Chiusi, and Peru- gia began exploiting abundant local supplies of alabaster to produce funerary urns with mythological scenes carved in high relief. The majority of these urns date to between 200 and 90 B.C. and bear over 50 recognizable scenes of myth, drawing on an Italic tradition of narrative representation. In style, however, they reflect Greek influence. For urns with figured scenes, alabaster was the material overwhelm- ingly preferred: of almost 400 "mythological" urns from Volterra alone, only 56 were carved in local tufa; alabaster, relatively soft, could be sculpted in sometimes complex small-scale figural compositions more easily than coarse, hard tufa. But while Etruscan artists of the Hellenistic period were developing a distinctive tradition of alabaster reliefs, a pat- tern of use and production of alabaster objects in Greece is far from clear. Etruria was by no means the only source of alabaster in antiquity. Ancient literary evidence suggests that Cappadocia and Syria, as well as Egypt, supplied ala- baster to the West, and early trade in alabaster between Egypt and Minoan Crete is well documented at several sites by the MM II-LM I period. A later Cypriot connection is recognized in the style of several small kouroi from two sanctuaries at Naukratis. Most frequently in the Greek world, vessels in what has been identified as Egyptian ala- baster are known: alabastra, but also pyxides and funnels, are found at Athens, Delphi, Corinth, and other sites, in fifth and fourth century B.C. contexts. That not all these vessels were imported as finished products is suggested by the alabaster drill cores found at the Athenian Pnyx in a fifth-fourth century level. Inscriptions also reflect the presence of alabaster objects in Greece. These include one of the so-called Attic Stelai and a second-century B.C. gymnasium inventory from the Athe- nian Agora that lists sculptures, artists, and materials, in- cluding alabaster. But when dealing with the ancient sources and the objects themselves, one problem yet to be comprehen- sively explored is the shifting meaning of the ancient terms for alabaster, and its modern scientific identification. IN-SITU CONSERVATION OF EXCAVATED WALL-PLAS- TERS: Thomas C. Roby, International Center for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural Property, Rome Often the most fragile and significant part of excavated structural remains on archaeological sites is decorative wall- plaster. Its vulnerability to environmental exposure requires prompt action by a conservator at the moment of excavation and continued maintenance if it is to be conserved in situ. This paper reports on a series of conservation procedures used in Italy on wall-plasters, both during excavation and afterward. A major risk to excavated wall-plasters is damage due to the crystallization of soluble salts in the ground and in exca- vated objects. Techniques for protecting a wall-plaster sur- face from this phenomenon during excavations are pre- sented. Cleaning methods and techniques for consolidating wall-plasters in situ using injection grouting with hydraulic mortars are also presented. Options for continued protection after excavation of the vertical surfaces and borders of wall- plasters are discussed. Such options include lime-based mor- tar repairs and wall-capping, a biocide treatment to prevent growth of algae, the insertion of a protective drip course above wall-plaster remains, protective shelters, and tempo- rary or permanent backfilling of the excavated structures. With more careful attention paid to preventing deteriora- tion by intervening to control environmental change at the moment of excavation and using lime-based materials for consolidation measures, a major advance will be made in the in situ conservation of excavated wall-plasters. SESSION III-W: RECENT WORK AT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME: THE AR- CHAEOLOGY OF RELIGION IN ANCIENT ITALY THE SANCTUARY OF DEMETER MALOPHOROS, SELI- NOUS: Margaret M. Miles, Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies, Rome The proper demarcation of sacred boundaries is an in- trinsic and necessary part of every Greek sanctuary; a wealth of epigraphical and archaeological evidence from every part of the Greek world attests to the importance of the temenos, or delineated area. Previous studies have cen- tered on sanctuaries in mainland Greece and Asia Minor (e.g., B. Berquist, The Archaic Greek Temenos, Lund 1967). In this paper, the evidence for the boundaries and entrances of Greek sanctuaries in Sicily and southern Italy is examined, with special attention to the well-preserved fifth-century Propylon to the Sanctuary of Demeter Malo- phoros, Selinous.</page><page sequence="14">256 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 The Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros with its "mega- ron" temple served not only Demeter and Persephone, the most important cult in Sicily, but also included arrange- ments for several other related chthonic deities: Hekate, Zeus Meilichios, and later, the Punic goddess Tanit Pene Ba'al. A second megaron-like temple was recently discov- ered in the area adjacent to the perimeter wall of the Sanctu- ary (S. Tusa et al., SicArch 17 [1984] No. 54-55, 17-58). The Propylon was the only entrance to the Sanctuary; its cultic significance is attested further by a stone-lined well located in front of the outer steps, and the adjoining area sacred to Hekate, here in her role as Prothyraia, or "guar- dian of the gateway." Such formal arrangements for the Sanctuary, with a monumental entrance and carefully de- lineated boundaries, are especially appropriate to cults of Demeter and related deities. The Propylon was first excavated in the 1870s and 1880s, and was explored further by E. Gabrici, who gave brief no- tice of the results in his monograph on the Sanctuary (MonAnt 32 [1927] 75-87). The results of a new architec- tural study in 1988 of the Propylon are presented here, with plans, elevations, and other drawings. It had already been noted in a general study of Doric capitals that the profiles of the Propylon have a close affinity with those of Periklean Doric buildings in Athens (J. Coulton, BSA 74 [1979] 81-153); other similarities in proportion and detail are dis- cussed here, along with details which are specifically Sicil- ian. The Propylon at Selinous is an example of the "interna- tional" character of Western Greek architecture, a combina- tion of versatility in the established idiom together with in- genuity and willingness to experiment. CULT AND COROPLASTIC CRAFT IN MAGNA GRAECIA: Rebecca Miller Ammerman, Colgate University In Italy, the practice of dedicating a terracotta figurine as a votive offering at a sanctuary only became widespread from the time of Greek colonization. At sites such as Taran- to, Paestum, and Medma in Magna Graecia, thousands of such figurines-statuettes of goddesses and gods, human fig- ures, models of fruit and animals, and so forth-have come to light during the course of archaeological excavations. Vo- tive terracottas often provide important evidence for the na- ture of the cults practiced and the personalities of the deities worshipped at the sanctuaries where the figurines were ded- icated. In this regard, the iconography of the figurines is of fundamental importance. Technical aspects of votive terra- cottas, however, have tended to receive less attention. Most terracottas were made from molds. By tracing a mechanically related network of the casts and molds which derive from an archetype, it is possible to reconstruct a mold series. Thus, a given terracotta can often be placed in its respective position (generation and variant) within a mold series. By studying the fired clay fabrics of terracottas, it is sometimes possible to determine the place of manufacture of a given figurine and, when such fabric studies are combined with studies of mold series, to infer 1) the place of origin of the mold series itself (i.e., where the archetype was fash- ioned), and 2) areas of derivative production of the mold series (i.e., where the technology for the mold series was adopted). Since the selective adoption of mold technology in- volves the simultaneous adoption of the iconography of the mold series, it has important implications for the history of cult. Two case studies-one on the votive terracottas from Medma and one on those from the Santa Venera sanctuary at Paestum-illustrate how iconographic studies, when combined with careful analyses of mold series and fabrics, provide new insight into local cult practice and belief as well as ideological contact and exchanges between different pop- ulations of Italy. A SELECTION OF ITALIC TERRACOTTA OBJECTS FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME: Helen Nagy, University of Puget Sound The "Study Collection" of the American Academy in Rome offers a wide spectrum of miscellaneous antiquities composed of gifts donated over a period of time beginning in the late 19th century. The bulk of the material is unpub- lished and in most cases we have no indication of the exact provenance of the pieces. This discussion presents a selection of objects of Etruscan and Italic origin which display stylistic characteristics asso- ciated with the context of "popular" art. The aim of this paper is twofold: to make the objects known and to place them in stylistic and typological contexts in order to arrive at a closer idea of their provenances and their places in the his- tory of Italian culture. Two particular categories are to be discussed: votive ter- racottas and cinerary urns. The five votive figurines repre- sent types and styles particular to Etruria and Latium. Four of the five are related to nursing or care (three are actually kourotrophs) and one represents a pair of musicians playing auloi and a lyre. Examples of all of these types occur in cen- tral and southern Etruria and Latium in connection with sanctuaries of care and fertility. Their stylistic analysis points to a site in the vicinity of Rome as the most likely origin of the pieces. The five cinerary urns are attributed to Chiusi. Three bear inscriptions which enhance the expanding list of Etrus- can genealogies which have become so helpful in the study of social relations. One urn is a typically Chiusine cylindrical shape, and the remaining four are rectangular with the de- ceased represented reclining on the lid. The urns themselves bear relief decorations of subjects popular in the last phases of Etruscan art. These range in quality from the rudimen- tary, a symbolic gateway flanked by cypresses with swags, to a fairly sophisticated scene framed by columns, of a dextra- rum iunctio in front of a gate (complete with lion-head knockers) flanked by Charuntes. All of the examples are rel- atively well preserved. Their analysis and placement in the existing corpus of Chiusine urns enriches our perspective of popular funerary symbolism. THE ROLE OF ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN IN THE CHRIS- TIANIZATION OF THE ROMAN ARISTOCRACY IN THE LATIN WEST IN THE YEARS AFTER CONSTANTINE: THE EPIGRAPHICAL EVIDENCE: Michele R. Salz- man, Boston University The Roman senatorial aristocracy was the key social and economic class in the Western Roman Empire in the years</page><page sequence="15">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 257 after Constantine. The transition from paganism to Chris- tianity in the fourth century hinged on this group; once they became Christian, the Western Empire could be said to be essentially a Christian one. There are many theories to explain so complex a process as the Christianization of the Roman aristocracy. I explore one recent view which has emerged in the scholarly litera- ture. This view focuses on patterns of life in the senatorial aristocracy, especially patterns of family life, and empha- sizes the impact of intermarriage between pagans and Christians and the role of women in particular. It is argued that women (of all classes) were particularly attracted to Christianity because of the greater independence and sup- port, psychological as well as material, it offered when com- pared with the pagan cults. In order to examine the Christianization of women, I in- cluded, in a careful and systematic study, all the evidence-- archaeological as well as literary. Thus far, scholars have used the epigraphic evidence in a very limited way. They have tended to examine the process of Christianization in one or perhaps two families; the difficulties involved in un- raveling family ties and religious affiliations make this un- derstandable. But these epigraphic studies, based as they are on so limited a group, can be very misleading, especially if they are based on atypical families. In this paper I discuss only my preliminary findings con- cerning women in the Roman aristocracy. My first conclu- sion is that the role of women in the fourth-century church has been overstated. Based on my study, there are three rea- sons why I would dispute the current emphasis on aristo- cratic women in the process of Christianization. My find- ings suggest that women did not convert any earlier than men, which they should have done if Christianity had ap- pealed to women particularly. My findings also show very little evidence of intermarriage, suggesting a large popula- tion of pagan aristocratic men to marry. And in those few cases of intermarriage that I do find, women's influence on either husbands or children appears minimal. From my work thus far, it would appear that religion in late Roman society was transmitted across generations only when parent and child were of the same sex. Moreover, ties within the family between husband and wife were not sig- nificant as a means of Christianization. Intermarriage be- tween pagans and Christians was rare. Aristocratic women did not convert to Christianity substantially earlier than men. On the basis of my research, it now seems that if Chris- tianity had been left to private family affairs, it would have taken centuries longer to win the West. One must look to other factors to explain the rate and ease of the Christianiza- tion of the Roman aristocracy in the West. SESSION IV-K: PRE-ROMAN AND ROMAN ITALY THE NECROPOLEIS OF SATRICUM, 800-200 B. C.: BIO- LOGICAL CONTINUITIES: Marshall Joseph Becker, West Chester University The emergence of the Roman state within an area domi- nated by Etruscans was associated with social and political changes throughout central Italy. The analysis of mortuary patterns and skeletal populations provides direct evidence for the effects of these changes on the people living in the towns and emerging cities of Latium. Of importance for understanding the processes involved in the formation of the Roman state and the relationships among the various native cultures in the immediate area is the evidence being recovered from ancient Satricum. This site is strategically located at the major crossroad 50 km south of Rome. Excavations at Satricum since 1896 have provided direct information regarding life and culture change within a Latin settlement closely related to Rome. During the current program of excavation and analysis con- ducted by the University of Groningen, through the Dutch Institute in Rome, a previously unknown necropolis has been discovered. Located only 30 m from the principal tem- ple on the acropolis, these burials offer important informa- tion concerning social dynamics in the fifth century B.C. and provide new insights into the biological and cultural history of the site. Analyses of the human skeletal remains and the mortuary patterns of this necropolis are now in process. Preliminary comparisons between these data and similar material from the southwest necropolis of Satricum, as well as materials from the 1896-1899 and the 1907-1910 excavations, sug- gest biological and cultural continuities within this site from the ninth to the second century B.C. RELIGION, POLITICS AND ARCHAEOLOGY: EVIDENCE FOR THE SHRINE OF VOLTUMNA AND OTHER POLIT- ICAL SANCTUARIES IN ANCIENT ITALY: Ingrid E. M. Edlund-Berry, University of Texas at Austin Livy and other ancient authors describe how members of the Etruscan League met at the shrine of Voltumna to dis- cuss their strategy against Roman supremacy. The site has so far not been identified, but on evidence of a late inscrip- tion it is usually assumed that the sanctuary was located somewhere in or near Orvieto (Volsinii). Archaeological evidence from Etruria as well as other parts of Italy suggests that the shrine of Voltumna was just one of many gathering places used for combined political and religious purposes, and that the architectural and other features of such places differed from those of other types of sanctuaries. Although these gathering places were under divine pro- tection, the protecting divinity may or may not have been worshipped in a monumental temple at the site. Instead, the important features of such sites were open spaces for gather- ings of people, areas for eating and perhaps sleeping, and for the exchange of goods. The locations of these gathering places allowed easy access from neighboring communities along roads or rivers. The sanctity inherent in such places was shown by their association with significant natural fea- tures such as groves or springs. The recognition that the sacred and secular features of sanctuaries which were used for political gatherings deter- mined their layout permits us to identify archaeologically a form of sanctuary for which we otherwise have only literary and historical sources. Examples of such sites include Lucus Feroniae, Poggio Civitate, Serra di Vaglio and Rossano di Vaglio, S. Giovanni in Fonte, and Pietrabbondante. These</page><page sequence="16">258 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 and others provide a new insight into the religious traditions of ancient Italy, which looked to the countryside rather than the city, and which acknowledged divine intervention in everyday affairs as well as in political negotiations. EXCAVATIONS AT POGGIO CIVITATE, ITALY: Erik Niel- sen, University of Evansville In recent years, activity at Poggio Civitate has been con- centrated along the south flank of Piano del Tesoro, where a large stoa-like structure has been uncovered. Currently, the building contains 41 stone column bases, in three parallel rows aligned with the cardinal points of the compass. The placement of the bases indicates a structure whose minimum dimensions are 48.5 x 6.0 m. Lying on the floor of the build- ing are a number of architectural members which deserve consideration. Ten female antefix heads and 25 feline water spouts have been recovered to date. The evidence indicates that they formed part of an elaborate interlocking system of alternating female heads and lion spouts which served as both a structural and iconographic prototype for the lateral sima associated with the "Upper Building" on Piano del Tesoro. Further evidence suggests that the earlier system dates to the third quarter of the seventh century B.C. The discovery on the floor of the building of a terracotta mold for one of the architectural members again points to local pro- duction on the site. The presence of a rather sophisticated and developed sys- tem of roofing, already established by this early date necessi- tates a reevaluation of the role played by Etruria in the de- velopment of this type of architectural decoration. The com- bination of this form with an already developed system of acroterial decoration hints at a Villanovan tradition re- flected in the early hut urns. The objectives of the 1988 season were to complete the documentation of the building for final publication, to exca- vate the slope of the southern flank of Piano del Tesoro in search of the kiln(s) connected with the workshop and re- sponsible for the firing of the terracottas, and to survey other areas on the hill for evidence of occupation. CERAMIC RESOURCE PROCUREMENT IN ROMAN SOUTH ETRURIA: J. Theodore Pefia, University at Albany, State University of New York A survey of Roman ceramic production sites in South Etruria coupled with a program of compositional analysis has revealed patterns in ceramic resource procurement. Of the 19 workshops identified, 15 were located within 3 km of a clay source. In several cases chemical analysis has been used to demonstrate compositional similarity between work- shop products and clay samples from neighboring outcrops, suggesting that potters were exploiting these sources. Since potting clay is a rare and discontinuously distributed re- source within the region, it seems likely that local availabil- ity of clay was an important factor in the geography of ce- ramic production. This pattern is consistent with practices of resource procurement attested among contemporary pot- ters in non-industrialized societies. Two specific case studies are discussed in order better to illustrate practices of clay procurement in Roman South Etruria. The first is from the Veii area. Two workshops were situated at the margin of the only known clay outcrop in the southern Ager Veienta- nus. One of these is located immediately inside the Valle La Fata Gate, suggesting the location of a possible potters' quarter within the city. The second case study involves a first-century A.C. sigillata workshop near Vasanello. Chemical analysis has revealed that workshop products were manufactured in two different clays, one used for free- thrown forms and the other for mold-made pieces. A similar approach has been employed by Vasanello potters in recent times. Geological and compositional considerations suggest that both ancient and modern potters have exploited the same or similar clay sources. "SUBURBANIZATION" OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CAM- PAGNA: EVIDENCE FROM BRICK STAMPS: James C. Anderson, jr., University of Georgia The architectural development of the Campagna in anti- quity followed the main roads that led from the city. Al- though physical remains are fragmentary and in many cases have disappeared due to urban expansion since World War II, a body of evidence exists which permits us to trace the "suburbanization" of the area with some chron- ological accuracy. Between ca. 1890 and 1920, Thomas Ashby explored the Campagna and described its ancient topography; his studies remain central to archaeological research in the region. During his investigations, Ashby noted and collected a large number of Roman stamped bricks, in most instances record- ing provenience information insofar as possible. The study of brick stamps was then in its infancy and Ashby was un- able to use the evidence of the stamps to confirm or refute archaeological chronologies. His collection of stamps was given to the American Academy in Rome in 1924, where it remains, but his field notes, diaries, maps and photographs stayed in the archives of the British School; neither collec- tion has been able to be used profitably without reference to the other. Recent research on these stamps and in the Ashby archives has revealed that in fact exact findspots and archi- tectural contexts can be assigned to some 75% of the Ashby stamps. In turn, advances in scholarly knowledge of this class of inscription (particularly by H. Bloch and M. Stein- by) now permit the stamps to offer the probability of devis- ing a detailed chronology for the suburban development of the Campagna in antiquity while Ashby's notes, maps, and photographs clearly document ancient remains now lost or destroyed. In this paper, I consider the light the Ashby brick stamps throw on the dating of important remains in the Campagna, align their evidence with the corroborating material recently discovered in the Ashby archives, and attempt to draw a gen- eral pattern of development for some of the major areas of the ancient Campagna in chronological sequence based on the dates and findspots of the brick stamps. While individual datings of remains may have to be challenged, the overall development of the ancient Campagna as described by Ashby is largely confirmed, but now placed on secure chro- nological bases by this research.</page><page sequence="17">19891] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 259 PROBLEMS OF CHRONOLOGY, DECORATION, AND UR- BAN PLANNING OF THE FORUM AT POMPEII: John J. Dobbins, University of Virginia Bonding between buildings, evidence of alterations and repairs, traces of marble revetment, and the revetting of the previously painted facade of the Temple of Vespasian point to problems in the commonly held view of the building his- tory of the Forum at Pompeii. Focusing on the buildings on the east side of the Forum, this paper challenges the notion that the Forum was largely unfinished at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius and provides evidence for reassessing traditionally held chronologies of individual buildings. For example, post-construction alterations in the sacellum of the Temple of Vespasian, possible earthquake repair in several places, and a complete change of facade decoration suggest a life for the structure that is longer than usually believed and which is incompatible with a view that the structure belongs to the last years of Pompeii. Moreover, the bonding of the Temple of Vespasian facade with the facade of the Euma- chia Building indicates that the building histories of the two structures are interrelated and should be studied together rather than separately, as is always the case. Similar obser- vations are made for the Macellum and for the Sanctuary of the Public Lares. The urban design implications of these observations are profound, for it appears that the shaping of the urban core of the city was at least partly a design scheme that transcended the piecemeal construction of individual buildings and in- cluded larger sectors of the Forum. A correct dating of the buildings and an enhanced appreciation of their role in shaping the urban fabric of Pompeii will provide a better overall understanding of the Pompeian Forum in Roman urban history and in the Roman architectural revolution of the first century A.C. LORD OF THE PROWS-AUGUSTUS AND THE ROSTRA OF THE ROMAN FORUM: William M. Murray, Uni- versity of South Florida By the time of his triple triumph in August 29 B.C., Oc- tavian was supreme on both land and sea throughout the Roman world. Though his successes at sea owed much to others (Agrippa in particular), Octavian skillfully utilized the resulting honors in a propaganda statement directed against his main rival, M. Antonius. Archaeological, numis- matic, and literary evidence reveals that Augustus, through- out his career, collected "rostral" honors in a spirit of compe- tition with Antonius. It seems that he methodically worked for a generation to eradicate a strong connection which existed between the Antonian gens and the Republican speaker's platform (itself decorated with warship rams). Such a motive helps to explain the ram displays he eventu- ally constructed in the Roman Forum. Although previous investigators have overlooked the An- tonian phase of the rostra, the initial link between the family and the rostra developed in 97 B.C. when M. Antonius (as censor) refurbished the speaker's platform from the spoils of his Cilician naval triumph (Cic. De Or. 3.3.10). In 45 this connection was reaffirmed when Caesar had the censor's grandson and namesake oversee the monument's transfer from the Comitium to the western end of the Forum (Dio 43.49.2). Though approved by Caesar, this honor appar- ently bothered Caesar's heir, a fact made clear by the subse- quent actions of both himself and his adherents. Over the next generation, Octavian was awarded many rostral honors. The most important one came at the expense of Antonius: the right (in 30) to build a "Julian" rostra in front of the new temple of Divus Iulius directly across from the "Antonian" rostra. For its ornamentation, the Senate al- lowed the use of rams captured from Antonius at Actium. The final act in his campaign to remove the "Antonian" rostra occurred sometime around 12 B.C. if we may judge from a recent analysis of the Forum's pavements and from the evidence of two coins minted at the time. At this point, Octavian "enlarged" the Antonian rostra, buried the offend- ing platform under a mass of concrete and extended its east- ern facade in a rectangular projection. Henceforth, the new platform was called the Rostra Augusti. This new interpre- tation both fits the character of the man who claimed to have "reestablished the Republic," and explains the confusing re- mains that have been excavated over the years in the Roman Forum. SESSION IV-L: LATE ANTIQUITY AND BY- ZANTIUM CYPRUS FROM THE NEOLITHIC TO THE LATE ROMAN: THE 1987 AND 1988 FIELD SEASONS OF THE VASILI- KOS VALLEY PROJECT AND THE KALAVASOS-KOPET- RA PROJECT: Murray C. McClellan, Emory Uni- versity, Marcus Rautman, University of Missouri at Columbia, Alison South, and Ian A. Todd, Bran- deis University The Vasilikos Valley is located along the southern coast of Cyprus and has been explored by the multidisciplinary Vasilikos Valley Project (VVP), directed by I.A. Todd since 1976. Research conducted by the VVP has concentrated on the aceramic Neolithic site of Kalavasos-Tenta and on the Late Bronze Age (LC IIC) site of Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimi- trios. The residential and agricultural growth of the region has necessitated rescue excavations on the extensive Middle Bronze Age cemetery under the modern village as well as on surrounding Late Bronze, Archaic, and Hellenistic tombs. In pursuit of its goal to provide a complete scientific investi- gation of the prehistory of a single Cypriot river valley, the VVP has undertaken a major regional survey, incorporating specialized geological, geomorphological, palaeobotanical, palaeozoological and site territorial analyses. The 1987 season at Ayios Dhimitrios completed the exca- vation of Building X, a monumental structure with interior courtyard and large storage facilities that dates to the Late Cypriot IIC period (ca. 13th century B.C.). Building X was shown to have a large ashlar well at its southeastern corner. 1987 was also the preliminary season of the Kalavasos- Kopetra Project (KKP), directed by M. McClellan for the University of Pennsylvania and M. Rautman for the Uni- versity of Missouri-Columbia. The focus of the KKP is the large late Roman site of Kopetra, which flourished in the</page><page sequence="18">260 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 sixth and early seventh centuries A.C. The first full-scale exploration of Kopetra, undertaken in July-August 1988, concentrated on a small basilica which apparently lay just outside of the main settlement. The 1988 season of the KKP also continued its systematic, intensive survey of the settle- ment in an attempt to assess in an economical way distinc- tions in the distribution of cultural material across the site. The KKP, by chronologically expanding the archaeological research of the Vasilikos Valley down to the Byzantine peri- od, is adding new perspectives on our view of the total his- tory of this small region of southern Cyprus. The advantages of combining prehistoric with historic re- search in an intensive regional survey are many. In the Mediterranean, at least, historical archaeologists have tended to overlook much of the evidence that concerns pre- historians. In the Vasilikos Valley, data concerning popula- tion size, diet, and exploitation of natural resources are sought for all periods of the human occupation of the region. Further, the archaeology of later periods in which the social organization is better known may help in the interpretation of earlier sites. The exploration of the Vasilikos Valley has uncovered remains of nearly all known periods of Cypriot prehistory and history. Of these, it seems that three-the Late Bronze, the Archaic, and the late Roman-witnessed major popula- tion growth. There is evidence that these large populations exploited the region's rich mineral as well as agricultural resources. STATIONS AND TOWERS ON THE QUSEIR-NILE ROAD: Steven E. Sidebotham, University of Delaware During Roman times the Quseir (Leukos Limen)-Nile road served as a principal thoroughfare between the Red Sea coast of Egypt, the Eastern Desert, and the Nile. Mer- chants plied this route with commodities imported from and exported to other areas bordering the Red Sea-Indian Ocean littoral. Products of the mines and quarries of the Eastern Desert also passed along this road. Eight fortified stations (hydreumata), other population centers, and about 65 towers delineate the route. Many of the stations contain wells or cisterns as potable water sup- plies were a primary requirement. The stations, constructed for security reasons, cover areas of ca. 1000-3000 m2 and are built almost exclusively of stacked stones. The towers are also built of stacked stones. Comparison of architectural details, however, shows that they differ from other towers in the Eastern Desert. Examination of the tow- ers' locations, construction, size, shape, and intervisibility indicates that they were signal platforms. ROMAN NABATAEA: THE SURVEY OF ARABIA PE- TRAEA: David F. Graf, University of Miami During the past decade, an intensive survey of the south- ern regions of Roman Arabia has been conducted. The ex- tensive area involved stretches between Petra in Jordan to Mada'in Salih in Saudi Arabia, approximately 450 km, comprised mainly of the desolate and basically unexplored HIisma desert. The survey produced substantial evidence for occupation of the region from the Iron Age to the Byzantine era. The most important of these results contribute to our understanding of the settlement pattern of the region, the road system that developed under Roman rule, the defensive system of this sector of the so-called limes Arabicus, and the Imperial borders of this most distant frontier province. Dur- ing the exploration of the region, several hundred sites have been recorded ranging from the prehistoric to the early Is- lamic periods. In addition, over 400 pre-Islamic Arabic, Na- bataean Aramaic, and Greek inscriptions have been col- lected. Only during the Nabataean and Byzantine periods is there any evidence for the expansion of settlements into the desert fringe. On the plateau and at the edge of the escarp- ment, evidence for qanat systems, reservoirs, cisterns, aque- ducts and other hydrological works made possible the exten- sion of the agricultural settlements. Discovery of several dozen new milestones in tandem with adjacent paved stretches of road reveals a complex transportation lattice for the region, with at least three major north-south routes: the outlying posts in the Hijdz represent only a limited and tem- porary penetration of the region during the Severan era. THE 1988 ABILA OF THE DECAPOLIS EXCAVATION: W. Harold Mare, Covenant Theological Seminary In the 1988 season of excavation conducted at Abila of the Decapolis, northern Jordan, June 18 to August 6, further excavation of the seventh-century A.C. basilica on the south tell, Umm el 'Amad, exposed many of the remaining pieces of the 12 columns and capitals which had stood on each of the north and south stylobates and many of the fragments of the massive monumental four-column entrance/porch in front of the main threshold. In addition to the opus sectile floor in the nave, remains of multicolored mosaic flooring in patterns were found in adjoining areas. Additional information was obtained in excavating at the seventh-century A.C. basilica on Tell Abila that the builders there had extensively used the earlier structure (possibly a Roman temple) underneath as part of its foundation. Also it became increasingly evident that in the Umayyad period the basilica had been considerably altered and parts of it used for other building purposes. At the theater cavea located to the northeast of the Umm el 'Amad basilica extensive excavation revealed that part of a Byzantine basilica and later an Umayyad palace had been constructed within the theater cavea area; there was evi- dence that Abbasid and Ayyubid/Mamluk people had also used the palace. Extensive excavation was again conducted in the Hellen- istic/Roman/Byzantine cemetery located along the wadi ledges and an extensive search was also made for Iron and Bronze Age tombs in the area; important salvage was done in one such Late Bronze/Iron Age tomb complex. Work was resumed at the 5 m-high north city wall on Tell Abila where a deep trench dug inside and perpendicu- lar to the wall revealed that the wall was used as far back as the late Roman period. WALL PAINTING FROM THE EPISCOPAL BAPTISTERY AT STOBI, YUGOSLAVIA: Caroline Hemans, Boston University The joint American/Yugoslav excavations at Stobi, Yugoslavia in 1971 uncovered a Baptistery on the south side</page><page sequence="19">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 261 of the Episcopal Basilica, which was itself first discovered in the early years of this century. Discovery of an early Baptis- tery is always an important event: at Stobi circumstances proved even more fortuitous, for preserved in the building debris were many fragments of wall painting. Despite their fragmentary condition and multiple layers of paint, careful reconstruction, documentation, technical analyses, and com- parative research in the years since excavation have allowed the formation of a surprisingly complete picture of the Bap- tistery's decorative program. The first-phase paintings, dated to the late fourth century, are associated not with the Episcopal Basilica, but with its predecessor, Building A. The largest reconstructed section formed part of the Baptistery's northeast conch, and con- tained a portrait of the evangelist Matthew, identified by an inscription. On the east wall appears the young Christ, per- haps performing the miracle of the healing of the blind. A striking parallel to this scene is found in a sculptural relief of the Theodosian period. Theodosius himself visited Stobi in 388, and it is tempting to associate the paintings with his visit. On the basis of these two main scenes, and fragments of others, the overall decorative program of the Baptistery can be discerned. Each of four conches held the figure of an evangelist, while the walls between featured scenes from the life of Christ. Comparison with other early Baptisteries in- dicates that the choice of iconographic material was remark- ably consistent. The Naples Baptistery contains apsidioles bearing symbols of the four evangelists, and in its dome scenes from the life of Christ. As early as the third century, the house Baptistery at Dura Europos displayed the mira- cles of Christ. Sometime during the fifth century, the Stobi Baptistery's first-phase paintings were painted over and replaced by a rather crude, mostly non-figural design, with large red crosses in the spaces formerly occupied by evangelists. Tech- nical analyses of the paint pigments confirm the impression of a decline in quality: the first-phase blue pigment was formed of azurite, a fairly rare and expensive mineral, while in the second phase the painters used crushed blue glass. Ironically, repainting the Baptistery had the unintended ef- fect of preserving the earlier paintings and enabled their eventual reconstruction. A LATE ROMAN/EARLY BYZANTINE CEMETERY AT CARTHAGE: Mark B. Garrison and John H. Hum- phrey, University of Michigan, and Susan Stevens, Indiana University In 1987 and 1988 the University of Michigan (Kelsey Museum) has worked in Carthage at a cemetery site located just outside the Theodosian Wall on the north side of the city. Our excavations have concentrated on the latest phase of burials (fifth-sixth centuries A.C.). The project has two major thrusts. One is a general demographic study of the population through the analysis of the human skeletal remains (sexing, aging, possible causes of death, and dietary deficiencies). The other is the docu- mentation of burial customs in the period under study and the examination of the spatial distribution of the burials. Several patterns have begun to emerge after two seasons of excavation. With the exception of a few funerary mosaics, the modest nature of the burials suggests that this cemetery was largely used by the lower economic classes. Graves are located parallel to the adjacent city wall, normally with heads at the west. Within a band ca. 5 m outside the wall they follow one another in roughly straight lines. Beyond this band, only infant burials in amphorae and mudbrick cists have been found. Burial types are quite varied. They include simple inhumations in shallow pits, cist burials (both stone and mudbrick), amphora burials (infants), indi- viduals covered by half-amphora or amphora sherds, vari- ous combinations of amphora sherd and cist burials, and a small burial structure containing several mosaic pavements, one of which recorded the name of the deceased (CODBUL- DEUS). ROMAN AND BYZANTINE SITES ON THE PAXIMADHI PENINSULA: SURVEY RESULTS 1986-1988: Cynthia K. Kosso, Southern Euboea Exploration Project Recent surface surveys of the Paximadhi peninsula by the Southern Euboea Exploration Project (SEEP) have yielded new information concerning settlement patterns on Euboea during Roman and Byzantine times. An intensive pedes- trian strategy was used which involved walking in teams of three to six people spaced 5-10 m apart as determined by the terrain. The survey area has yielded more material evidence for the Roman than the Byzantine period. The Roman remains include two fairly substantial (ca. 300 x 300 m) agricultural sites located at the southern end of an upland plateau. These sites contained numerous building remains, threshing floors, millstones, and pottery. A third Roman agricultural site was located at the edge of a low plain on the east coast of the peninsula. With the exception of one Byzantine chapel, one goat mondra and a small tower located on the east coast, there is very little definite Byzantine architecture. The By- zantine presence is indicated primarily by sherd scatters. In contrast to the evidence for the Classical period, rela- tively few Roman and Byzantine sites and findspots were identified. This supports a hypothesis that agricultural use of the peninsula may have decreased in the Roman and By- zantine periods, possibly in favor of goat herding, which is the predominant occupation on the peninsula today. SESSION IV-U: ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANNA- LES: TOWARD RESOLUTION OF THE AR- CHAEOLOGICAL/DOCUMENTARY DILEMMA INTRODUCTORY REMARKS: A. Bernard Knapp, Uni- versity of Cambridge Because certain complex societies engendered a great variety and number of written records, documentary evi- dence has often dominated socio-historical interpretation, often at the expense of the archaeological. In the study of the (pre- or proto-) historical past, and of past processes at work, it is necessary to create a dialogue between the mate-</page><page sequence="20">262 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 rial and the documentary, neither of which overrides the other. Inherent in the archaeological record of any time or place are long-term processes; more intrinsic to documen- tary evidence are short-term events. Yet this does not deny that the archaeological record bears witness to critical mo- ments of change, nor that documentary materials portray economic patterns and sociopolitical trends. The symposium papers draw upon methodological varia- tions of the Annales socio-historical approach to the past in order to examine the uncritical and often unquestioned com- parison or contrast of archaeological and ancient documen- tary evidence. As more than one study demonstrates, Anna- les methodology may also be adopted to evaluate the purely material record of prehistoric cultures. An Annales ap- proach demands equal consideration for processes of contin- uity and change, whatever the medium that highlights them. It also forces us to realize that certain variables-archaeo- logical or historical-must be weighed on different time scales, and that objectivity resides in the use of appropriate methods to elaborate and elicit cultural or historical "facts." The papers in this symposium investigate how Annales- oriented research attempts to combine archaeological, his- torical, and social scientific approaches to the study of the past into a single, human scientific approach. Individual case studies seek to bring together all relevant data in the quest for a meaningful solution to the problems of under- standing continuity and change in prehistoric, protohistoric, or historic-period society. The goal is not so much to pro- duce "historical science" (Stephen Jay Gould) as to generate an interdisciplinary, multivariate human science that gives equal weight to all relevant variables. TIME PERSPECTIVISM, ANNALES, AND THE DILEMMA OF ARCHAEOLOGY: Roland Fletcher, University of Sydney This paper provides discussion of the need for a hierarch- ical arrangement of the kinds of explanations we use to deal with processes that occur over different scales of space and time. The aim is to define what type of hierarchy is needed. In a hierarchical structure of theories, large-scale processes cannot be reduced to small-scale ones and small-scale ones are not determined by large-scale ones. By contrast a reduc- tionist view holds that the nature of the smallest component sufficiently explains the largest system or is essential for a basic understanding of it. Hierarchical explanations are usual in the biological sciences, the earth sciences and the hard sciences, contrary to much misapprehension about them by members of humanistic disciplines. The trend is toward these integrative explanatory structures. A version of the hierarchical explanation has been intro- duced to history by the Annales School, Braudel in particu- lar suggesting that it is not incompatible with studies of human beings. Biologists such as S.J. Gould have no diffi- culty in arguing that history, in the sense of successions of unique events, matters in a study of the vast patterns and processes of biological evolution, and is consistent with "science." It follows that a history of science dichotomy in archaeology or any study of human beings is founded on suspect premises about the significance of uniqueness and determinism. Since biological, geographical, and historical theories are regularly used in archaeology, we already use tacit hierarchical arrangements of theory but do not have a rigorously defined hierarchy of explanation. This paper stresses that the hierarchies proposed in An- nales history are defective and will undermine the prospect of developing an effective integration because they are not sufficiently coherent to carry the burden put upon them. The weakness is even more severe in archaeology. The cru- cial hiatus in the hierarchies of explanation so far proposed is the lack of a coherently defined level of process for the operational effects of the material component of human be- havior on the functioning of human communities. Until this fundamental weakness is remedied there is little prospect of an integrated explanatory approach for archaeology and history. FORAGING, FOOD PRODUCTION, AND SOCIAL COM- PLEXITY: ANALYZING THE WESTERN MEDITERRA- NEAN NEOLITHIC: James G. Lewthwaite, University of Bradford The real significance of this session lies in the discovery by the American anthropological tradition of European his- toricism: historical theory actually applies to literature-less societies. At this level, the Annales might serve as a bridge for the thinking of Vico, Dilthey, Nietzsche, or Colling- wood; at another level the relevance may be the reverse. Whereas the Annales stand for the transfusion of social science into history, the social sciences now need rejuvena- tion through an appreciation of the historically contingent nature of their data and theories: one obvious instance is the current reassessment of hunter-gatherer societies conse- quent upon the realization of the longue duree of their incor- poration in the "World System" engendered by the Age of Discovery. In the case of the Western Mediterranean Neolithic, in- vocation of the Annales reinforces a movement already un- derway toward research into subsistence, settlement, society, and cognition, promising far more than the obsessive data collection that has long passed for archaeology. More spe- cifically, the richness and variety of data permit a critical evaluation of the Braudelian triad of event-conjuncture- structure, with particular applicability to the successive transitions from foraging to food production (6000-3000 B.C.) and from relatively simple to more complex forms of society (from ca. 3000 B.C. on). Aspects of the transition to farming (especially if the writer's "Filter Model" proves ac- ceptable) seem to challenge the underlying assumptions of the Braudelian worldview. In this respect, archaeology can serve as well as be served by the Annales. SOCIETY, ECONOMY, AND POLITY IN THE BRONZE AGE LEVANT: A. Bernard Knapp, University of Cam- bridge Employing a framework based on Annales socio-histori- cal methodology, this paper examines archaeological and documentary data related to the Middle and Late Bronze Age southern Levant (2000/1900-1200 B.C.). Documen- tary evidence from the North Jordan and Jezreel Valleys is</page><page sequence="21">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 263 discussed as one independent source of information; ar- chaeological materials from the same region, and particu- larly from the North Jordan Valley site of Pella, are pre- sented as a separate, independent source. The Annales framework facilitates reciprocal examination of these two streams of evidence, and makes it possible to offer new per- spectives on political and economic factors that affected in- dependent and imperial polities in the North Jordan, Jez- reel, and Beth Shan Valleys between about 1700-1200 B.C. SMALL PASTS IN SYRO-PALESTINE: LEROY LADURIE AND THE WRITING OF LOCAL HISTORY: Frederic R. Brandfon, College of Charleston Archaeological historians have recently shown increased interest in the historiographic work of the Annales school. Much of that interest has been devoted to the work of Fer- nand Braudel. Braudel's multivolume works on the Medi- terranean and everyday life in Europe are vast in their scope. They take as their subject the life and times of an entire continent. Archaeologists who work in the Levant often focus on a much smaller geographic area. The region called Syro-Palestine is for the most part a strip of land along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Braudel's work, although interesting theoretically, may be less val- uable to a Syro-Palestinian archaeologist than the work of Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie. LeRoy Ladurie, a historian of the Annales School, has worked on an area of southern France along the Mediterra- nean coast. His works of regional history (The Peasants of Languedoc; Montaillou) may be relevant to Syro-Palestin- ian studies precisely because of their local focus. Further- more, LeRoy Ladurie has experimented with the relation- ship between texts and material remains in his historio- graphy. Such works as Love, Death, and Money in the Pays d'Oc are methodologically interesting to archaeologists who need to integrate material and textual evidence. This paper proposes a methodological study of LeRoy Ladurie's work along with suggestions for applying his ideas to Syro-Pales- tinian research. CARTHAGE, ROME, AND LA LONGUE DUREE IN NORTH AFRICAN AGRICULTURAL HISTORY: Joseph A. Greene, American Center of Oriental Research at Amman "North Africa was the breadbasket of Imperial Rome." As with all such historical commonplaces, the real situation was more complex than the simple statement of fact allows. Ancient agriculture in North Africa operated under techno- logical and social constraints that limited the size, even the certainty of annual cereal harvests. It was an enterprise fraught with risks, both environmental and cultural, risks that could and did limit North Africa's role as a consistent exporter of cereal grains. This paper examines key aspects of North African agricultural history-environment, socie- ty, economy-in an effort to elucidate its complexity and trace its main trends. The argument draws on interlocking and complementary lines of evidence from archaeology, an- cient written sources, and contemporary ethnography. A closer examination of a significant segment of la longue du- rde of North African agricultural history-broadly from the Late Punic period to the end of Byzantine rule at Carthage (fourth century B.C. to seventh century A.C.)-will serve both to justify and modify in detail North Africa's claim to be the "breadbasket of Imperial Rome." POTTERY STYLES AND SOCIAL STATUS IN EARLY IS- LAMIC KHURASAN: Richard W. Bulliet, Columbia University Excavations conducted at Nishapur in Khurasan (north- eastern Iran) by the Metropolitan Museum of Art uncov- ered rich and varied ceramic remains. Several distinct styles and shapes existed simultaneously in the Early Islamic peri- od and appear to be new products of a developing society. Some styles were duplicated in other parts of northeastern Iran; others were particular to Nishapur. All were super- seded at about the same time in approximately the 12th cen- tury A.C. The period of pottery development was also the period during which the population of Khurasan gradually con- verted to Islam. Nishapur, which had not been an appre- ciable city before Islam, grew to a population of over 100,000 and had an overwhelmingly Muslim character. Yet the Iranian converts to Islam, not to mention immigrant Arabs and Turks, came from differing social milieus. This paper will investigate the relationship among conversion, social background, and pottery style preference in an effort to show how historians of the Annales School can integrate excavation materials with quantifiable and descriptive tex- tual data to produce social history. SETTLEMENT PATTERNS AND DOCUMENTS: INCASTEL- LAMENTO IN CENTRAL ITALY: John Moreland, University of Sheffield This paper is concerned with a major transformation in the Italian landscape-incastellamento-whereby the pat- tern of dispersed late Roman villas was replaced by one of nucleated hilltop villages. Documentary sources date this process to the 10th and 11th centuries A.C.; its causes are disputed. Archaeologists have recently challenged the docu- mentary dating evidence, suggesting that archaeology can show the process started earlier, and that the documents give a 10th-century date simply because this is when records were kept on a large scale. I attempt to show the fallacy of the archaeologist's posi- tion, which is based on excavation of single sites to show a date earlier than that documented. I further suggest that a lack of appreciation of the nature of the documentary evi- dence by archaeologists and historians, and the great signifi- cance of its appearance at a particular point in time, has obscured the importance of the changes taking place. The appearance of records on a relatively large scale and the con- comitant incastellamento process should be seen in the light of the collapse of the state in 10th-century A.C. Italy and the reemergence of private might over state right. While this study can be fitted within the broad frame- work of Annales thinking and scholarship, it seeks to avoid the environmental and economic determinism to which the latter is sometime prone through an emphasis on the recur-</page><page sequence="22">264 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 sive nature of the relationship between Nature and Man, and between social structures and human agents. BRAUDEL AMONGST THE AZTECS: ARCHAEOLOGY, HIS- TORY, AND THE LONGUE DUREE IN MESOAMERICA: Michael E. Smith, Loyola University of Chicago This paper applies insights from the work of Fernand Braudel to the problem of correlating archaeology and native history in Postclassic central Mexico. Two aspects of Braudel's notion of hierarchical temporal rhythms are em- phasized. First, Braudel's theoretical construct provides a useful framework for conceptualizing past time and pro- cesses of change in complex societies. Second, his empirical findings on the nature of socioeconomic change and its rhythms contribute to the dialectical interaction between changing research questions and chronological refinement. These points are illustrated through an examination of ar- chaeological and native historical data on processes of socio- economic change in Postclassic central Mexico. Greater at- tention to temporal rhythms and chronological issues can lead to more successful archaeological/historical correlation in central Mexico and thereby helps to advance our under- standing of processes of change. SESSION V-P: THE FIRST CITIES IN TEMPER- ATE EUROPE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS: Peter S. Wells, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities The purpose of this colloquium is to present results of ongoing research into the development of the first cities in Europe north of the Mediterranean Basin-the great walled settlements, called oppida by Caesar, that occur today from central France in the west to Slovakia in the east. These cities emerged during the final two centuries before Christ, as Rome was expanding its territories northward, and constitute a unique development in late prehistoric Eu- rope. Recent interdisciplinary studies in Austria, Czechoslo- vakia, France, and Germany have generated abundant new data on many different aspects of these urban centers. We can now place these cities into the wider political, social, and economic contexts of Europe and the Mediterranean world just before the time of Christ. PRE-URBAN SETTLEMENTS IN PREHISTORIC TEMPER- ATE EUROPE: Peter I. Bogucki, Princeton Univer- sity This paper reviews the variability in form and distribu- tion of settled farming communities in temperate Europe prior to the emergence of urban centers. A particular focus is on the evidence for both nucleated agrarian communities and isolated households beginning during the Neolithic at about 4500 B.C. and continuing through the Bronze Age and early Iron Age. The goal of the paper will be to trace long-term developmental trends that preceded the emer- gence of urban centers in temperate Europe. LANDSCAPE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH URBANIZA- TION IN TEMPERATE EUROPE: Amy L. Ollendorfand H.E. Wright, Jr., University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Two related aspects of urbanization in a European Iron Age context are of particular significance when considering landscape changes: large population sizes and the produc- tion of iron. Because Iron Age towns and cities had many more inhabitants than agricultural villages of preceding pe- riods, greater amounts of land were cleared for housing, grazing, and cultivation. Use of iron implements facilitated land clearance and tillage. Forested areas were also cleared so that felled timber could be used as fuel in iron production. Iron Age land-use practices affected the landscape in sev- eral ways. Densities and distribution of local and regional plants and animals, for instance, were altered. Cereal grains and other crops were cultivated, while other plants invaded fields as weeds. Livestock was introduced. Runoff and soil erosion from cleared areas increased, changing hydrological regimes, and lakes became polluted. This paper reviews published examples of landscape changes associated with urbanization in Scandinavia, Eng- land, Poland, and Germany. Landscape changes in these geographic regions are elucidated through combinations of several analytical techniques. Sediment lithology, diatoms, algal pigments, macrobotanical remains, pollen, and micro- scopic charcoal fragments provide indications of the impact of agriculture and urbanization on the landscape. The paper also discusses the applicability of these methods and results toward landscape studies at Kelheim, West Germany. Pet- rographic, geochemical, palaeomagnetic, pollen, and phyto- lith analyses are proposed as complementary techniques for assessing landscape changes in and around Kelheim. THE SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF URBANISM IN IRON AGE EUROPE: Bettina Arnold, Harvard University The development of urbanism in a culture is inevitably accompanied, and in some cases preceded, by significant and far-reaching changes in virtually all of its components. Un- like more easily identifiable systems represented relatively directly in the archaeological record, social structure is diffi- cult to isolate as a causal factor, and yet it is of particular importance in any discussion of culture change. The transi- tion from the nascent urbanism of the Late Hallstatt period to the recognizably urban Celtic centers of the late La Tene period is characterized by major changes in burial practices, ritual structures, iconographic repertoire, settlement organi- zation, trade, and industry, all of which are identifiable ar- chaeologically. None of these changes could have occurred independently of concomitant transformations in the organi- zation of society. This paper examines the types of archaeo- logical clues which can be used to reconstruct such changes in social organization, especially the evidence inherent in the ceramic and faunal material from settlements, grave good inventories, and the transformation of sacred places in the course of the period under discussion. INDUSTRY, TRADE, AND DEVELOPMENT OF CITIES: Peter S. Wells and Carl Blair, University of Minne- sota, Twin Cities</page><page sequence="23">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 265 The first urban centers of temperate Europe developed during the second century B.C., and from their earliest phases the importance of manufacturing and commerce is apparent in the archaeological evidence. Most of the centers were established close to natural resources that formed the basis of their industrial economies. Social changes that were taking place at the time stimulated the production of new quantities of goods for consumption, as well as intensive cir- culation of a wide range of natural and processed materials. Examination of changing relationships between people and their material culture help us to understand the special conditions under which new industrial communities became centers of economic and social life during the Late Iron Age. Iron production was a particularly important aspect of this expanding manufacturing activity. Iron-working in- creased greatly during this period. Many more objects, and many more kinds of objects, were being made than ever be- fore. New research into the organization of iron metallurgy during the Late Iron Age is providing valuable insight into the processes of change that led to the development of tem- perate Europe's first cities. GREEK AND ROMAN DESCRIPTIONS OF IRON AGE Eu- ROPE: Sean Dunham, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities In order to trace the long-term development of European urban centers from the Late Iron Age on, an understanding of the dynamics of La Tene society is required. The integra- tion of data from textual sources with the archaeological evi- dence can provide rich insights. Classical texts can be used to form questions for testing against the archaeological record, to study site structure and formation, and to enhance inter- pretation of features and artifacts. Traditionally, the written sources have been used to focus on questions of a historical and/or geographical nature, on isolated sites, and on their occupants in time and space. Tex- tual information can also be used to explain the dynamics of the past. A specific example is presented to show how Classical texts can help us to understand the dynamic processes be- hind the formation of the oppida-the great urban commu- nities of Late Iron Age Europe. TRADE AND POLITICAL INTERACTION BETWEEN IRON AGE CITIES AND ROME: Stephen L. Dyson, Wes- leyan University While it is traditional to think of Roman policy in the West as a combination of wars of conquest and frontier con- trol, the reality was a complex and deep sphere of influence in which military, diplomatic, and economic factors oper- ated. Rome needed products from temperate Europe, espe- cially exotic raw materials and slaves. She wanted to prevent any concentration of power within European tribal groups. This could best be accomplished by establishing personal ties with local elites, by acculturating the natives to Medi- terranean material goods, and by encouraging divisions among the natives. Except for the narratives of Caesar and Tacitus these processes are ill documented in the literary sources. They can be understood best by a combination of archaeological evidence and the reconstruction of long-term Roman policy goals. In this paper, I attempt to place Roman actions in Gaul and Germany in the context of policy objectives and approaches developed in North Italy and Spain during the later Republic. REGIONAL ANALYTIC STRATEGIES FOR LATE IRON AGE EUROPE: Carole L. Crumley, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Until recently, late Iron Age Celtic society has been treated as if all Gaul was socially, politically, and economi- cally homogeneous, despite a considerable amount of docu- mentary evidence to the contrary. That continental Celtic polities were distinct from one another in important respects is clear from contemporary Classical texts, whatever other interpretive difficulties those sources might offer. Interpretations of large late Iron Age sites based primar- ily on archaeological information, on the other hand, draw on a rather tired set of models of settlement agglomeration whose most salient characteristics evoke Asiatic information and power hierarchies and Graeco-Roman urban templates which are not only markedly un-European (or at least un- Celtic) but also the hallmark of cultural evolutionism. I propose an analytical strategy appropriate to the heter- ogeneous and heterarchical nature of Celtic society, one which recognizes each polity's unique environmental advan- tages and constraints and relates these to practically avail- able sources of power and wealth. Using both natural scien- tific and literary evidence, information about the polity's en- vironment, subsistence strategies, and lines of communica- tion and delimitation is collected. Inasmuch as is possible, I link ecological and economic resources to particular portions of the territory each group was known to control. Special attention is paid to the polities' clientelist relations with one another, allowing an added analytical dimension. In this more integrated analysis of Celtic society, ques- tions of population agglomeration and dispersion (and the appearance of urban centers) turn on the subsistence requi- sites of the group as well as natural factors (e.g., climate) which affect the group's ability to sustain a certain density. SESSION V-Q: ROMAN SCULPTURE THE PRECARIOUS ICONOGRAPHY OF MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO: Ann M. Nicgorski, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The identification of representations of Cicero among the multitude of extant Roman portraits has, since the 16th cen- tury, been largely dependent on the inscribed bust in the Apsley House in London. Recently, however, the authentic- ity of the Apsley House inscription has been seriously chal- lenged by Hans Goette who recognized the classicizing form of the identifying name plate (RM 92 [1985] 291-318). Certain suspicions also surround the bust's late 16th-cen- tury appearance in the Mattei collection in Rome as well as its publication in the 1598 edition of Fulvio Orsini's Illus- trium Imagines.</page><page sequence="24">266 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 Consequently, new foundations for the ancient iconogra- phy of Cicero are necessary. An examination of ancient lit- erary sources and previously disregarded archaeological evi- dence indicates that portraits of Cicero were in existence during his lifetime and that they were copied and preserved throughout the Empire. In addition, a study of significant Mediaeval and Renaissance portraits of Cicero reveals that prior to the late 16th century, a portrait on a bronze coin struck at Magnesia-ad-Sipylum in Lydia and inscribed with the name Marcus Tullius Cicero (in Greek letters) was rec- ognized as Cicero's ancient likeness. But, because of the dis- similarity between this coin portrait and the Apsley House bust, modern scholars have identified the coin portrait as the son of the renowned orator. However, in light of the newly raised doubts surrounding the Apsley House inscription, this coin must be put forward as the only authentic repre- sentation of the famous Cicero which survives from ancient times. The appellation Pseudo-Cicero should be ascribed to the Apsley House bust and to each of the related portraits. OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRIMA PORTA DRAPERY STYLE: Richard A. Gergel, Central Michigan University Overfamiliarity with the Augustus of Prima Porta dis- guises the fact that one of the most characteristic features of this work, the draping of the paludamentum about the hips, is very rare, and can be found on only 11 of the approxi- mately 600 complete and fragmentary Roman Imperial cui- rassed statues which have survived to the present day. Fol- lowing its earliest appearance in Roman sculpture with the Augustus of Prima Porta, this mode for draping the paluda- mentum occurs on a Julio-Claudian torso in Baltimore; on late Flavian statues in Auch, Lecce, Madrid, and Rome; and on late Trajanic/early Hadrianic examples in Brindisi, Corinth, Palma de Mallorca, and Volubilis. In an article on the Baltimore torso (R. Gergel, "A Julio-Claudian Torso in the Walters Art Gallery," JWalt 45 [1987] 26-29) I cite these examples and propose that two variant modes for draping the paludamentum about the hips provide an indi- cation of heroization or deification. The origins for this drapery style can be traced back to the Greek-speaking East. Cornelius Vermeule ("Hellenistic and Roman Cuirassed Statues," Berytus 13 [1959] 13-17) records its appearance on Greek funerary monuments and Hellenistic reliefs. Klaus Stemmer (Untersuchungen zur Typologie, Chronologie und Ikonographie der Panzersta- tuen [Berlin 1978] 137-38) suggests a Hellenistic, perhaps Pergamene, prototype as a source for the drapery of the Prima Porta statue. I propose that additional iconographic evidence, derived from cistophoric reverse types minted in Asia, closely associates this drapery style with the worship of Roma and Augustus in the Imperial East. Evidence sug- gests, therefore, that the Prima Porta drapery style origi- nated in the imperial cult centers of the Greek-speaking East and that its use on cuirassed statues indicates a heroiza- tion of the emperor during his lifetime or the granting of divine honors after his death. FROM COLUMBARIUM TO MUSEUM: THE VIGNA CODI- NI PORTRAITS: Maxwell L. Anderson, Emory Uni- versity Museum of Art and Archaeology Three portrait busts of superb quality in the Museo Na- zionale Romano, which are part of an exhibition at the Emory University Museum in Atlanta, were discovered over 150 years ago in a highly informative context, but have remained unexhibited and essentially unpublished until now. The busts, which depict two men and a young woman, were retrieved during the excavation of a series of first-cen- tury tombs in the mid-19th century, and were part of the so- called second columbarium in the Codini vineyards along the Via Latina. This tomb, which was excavated by G.P. Campana in February 1847, was constructed by a corpora- tion whose shareholders reserved niches for their own cre- mated remains. There were 295 niches in the tomb, and well over 300 loculus inscriptions. From the inscribed evidence, we know that the tomb's occupants-and the subjects of the three portraits-were very likely liberti of Marcella the Elder, the former wife of Marcus Agrippa, and of Marcella the Younger, whose first marriage was to Paullus Aemilius Lepidus, as well as of other slaves and servants of the impe- rial family. The evidence of the tomb and its contents is discussed, as is the importance of the archaeological context in consid- ering the date and function of the portraits. A PRIESTESS OF CYBELE ON THE ALTAR FROM THE VI- CUS SANDALARIUS: Charles Brian Rose, University of Cincinnati An Augustan altar from the Vicus Sandalarius in Rome, securely dated to 2 B.C., contains a scene of three figures involved in a tripudium, a ceremony concerned with the tak- ing of military auspices prior to a military campaign. Au- gustus appears in the center as pontifex maximus, his adopted son, Gaius Caesar, stands at the left, and a veiled woman appears at the right holding a patera and acerra. Recent studies have conclusively established that this scene represents an actual tripudium which occurred in 2 B.C. immediately prior to the military campaign of Gaius Cae- sar, who was preparing to leave for Asia Minor, Parthia, and Armenia. Yet the identity of the woman at the right has always been problematic. She wears a diadem and a torque around her neck, and seems to perform a sacrifice as she looks toward the central tripudium scene. This woman has most often been identified as Livia, represented as a priest- ess or in the guise of Venus Genetrix, although there is in fact no evidence to support such an attribution. The facial features are completely idealized, and there is no physio- gnomic indication that any specific member of the imperial family is being presented. The primary key to the identity of this figure lies in her torque necklace and the fact that she seems, by virtue of her action, to be a priestess. In Roman art, only priests or priest- esses associated with the cult of Cybele wore torques as part of their official costumes. The sacrificing woman at the right should therefore be identified as a priestess of Cybele, and the diadem which she wears probably indicates her function as chief priestess of the cult. The presence of a priestess of a Roman state cult of Eastern origin at the scene of a tripu- dium can be understood only in the context of Gaius's East- ern campaign. The cult of Cybele was brought to Rome spe- cifically to ensure a Roman victory in the Second Punic</page><page sequence="25">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 267 War, and the affiliation of this cult with a military cam- paign would have been readily apparent. Furthermore, Gaius's campaign focused specifically on the East; the priestess of Cybele here would therefore have served as a geographical indicator of the area with which Gaius's mili- tary campaign was concerned, and her sacrifice would have implied the blessing of a goddess who not only maintained religious jurisdiction over the East, but was also closely tied to the Trojan origins of Rome and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. THE SO-CALLED VICOMAGISTRI RELIEF AND THE Divi- NIZATION OF LIVIA: Janet Duncan Jones, Toledo Museum of Art The so-called Vicomagistri Relief in the Vatican Muse- ums (inv. nos. 1156, 1157) consists of two large fragments, each showing a segment of a sacrificial procession. These relief fragments present an intriguing problem of interpre- tation: the costly bovine victims, including a cow, on the longer slab cannot be reconciled with a sacrifice by the Vico- magistri to the lares and Genius Augusti who appear on the shorter slab. The discovery that the two fragments are not contiguous (M. Anderson, BMonMusPont 1983) is of inter- est because it shows that the fragments do not necessarily represent a single sacrifice. Stylistically the fragments are closely related to reliefs dated to the reign of Claudius. This provides a key to the identification of the sacrifices. Claudius was a vigorous pro- moter of the imperial cult. One of his first acts was the divinization of Livia in A.D. 42. The three bovine victims are easily interpreted in the context of a state sacrifice hon- oring this occasion: a bull (taurus) to the Genius Augusti (Claudius), a young bull (bos mas) to Divus Augustus, and a cow to Diva Augusta. The lares and Genius Augusti, which formed an integral part of the imperial cult, received their own proper sacrifice of a pig and a bull on a different side of the monument. ROMAN PEDIMENTAL SCULPTURES: Eugenio La Rocca, Universitai di Siena The problem of the pedimental decoration of Roman temples has been once again taken into consideration on the basis of a reexamination of the so-called Ara Pietatis and of the finding of the sculptures pertaining to the gable of the Apollo Sosianus temple. In this paper I present, as further documentation of the subject, two sculptures from the Capitoline Museums which, after a more detailed analysis, can be considered ped- imental decorations. The first one is a statue that, according to widespread opinion, should represent a lounging Hera- kles, but which represents a river god lying, most likely, at the left-hand corner (as regards the viewer) of a gable, and probably comes from the Temple of Mars Ultor. The traces left by draining water on the front surface and the schematic rendering of the body on the back of the sculpture strongly support this theory. The second sculpture, which represents a standing Zeus, often considered to be a copy of the Zeus of Samos by My- ron, could also be put in a gable, as is shown by a pivot still visible inserted in the back of the figure, which was obvi- ously meant to be attached to a wall. Given its discovery in Piazza Campitelli, it could be a central pedimental sculp- ture, the one from the temple of Jupiter Stator at Portico d'Ottavia. A FLAVIAN FRIEZE AND MINERVA'S PATRONAGE OF CRAFTSMEN: Eve D'Ambra, Rutgers University at Newark A fragment of a Flavian marble frieze, excavated in 1938 near the Forum Holitorium in Rome but now in the Palazzo Caffarelli (the Antiquarium Comunale), depicts Minerva in a carpenter's workshop. It probably decorated a collegium or a related shrine (e.g., A.M. Colini, "Officina di Fabri Tignarii," Capitolium 22 [1947] 21-28). The frieze is sig- nificant because of its juxtaposition of a representation of a common occupation with a mythological subject, the tute- lary deity of craftsmen as well as the goddess of the Flavian dynasty. In fact, it is the figure of Minerva in the frieze which distinguishes it from the corpus of reliefs depicting occupations and relates it to Flavian imperial monuments. The frieze may link such privately commissioned works as the funerary reliefs of artisans in second-century Ostia with works of Flavian imperial art in the city of Rome. The scene of the carpenter's workshop with its oversize tools an- ticipates the format of the Ostian reliefs while Minerva's presence among the workers recalls aspects of Domitian's frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. The frieze from the Forum Holitorium, along with other non-extant works, may have provided a model for the Ostian reliefs. A discus- sion of the frieze's iconography and original context sheds light on the relationship between the official reliefs and indi- vidual commemorations, especially those commonly desig- nated as popular or plebeian in style. SPOLIA: THE SO-CALLED HISTORICAL FRIEZE ON THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE: Sandra Elaine Knudsen, Toledo Museum of Art It has long been recognized that major elements of the decorative scheme of the Arch of Constantine are spolia: the Great Frieze and Dacians of Trajan, the eight Hadrianic hunt tondi, and the eight panels of Marcus Aurelius. But the six narrow friezes between the tondi and the tops of the side arches are commonly called Constantinian and identified as historical reliefs depicting scenes of the conquest of Italy in 312: the Departure from Milan, Siege of Verona, Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Triumphal Procession, Oratio, and Largitio. This interpretation, however, needs to be challenged. It was contested by Wace at the turn of the century (BSR 4 [1907]), and the close personal examination of the reliefs that has been possible since the Arch was scaffolded in re- cent years impels me to question it again. There is strong evidence, visible in new photographs, that indicates that four, and possibly all six, of the friezes were reused from earlier monuments. The evidence includes the awkwardly cut holes to insert replacement imperial heads and the trun- cated legs of the crowds in the Oratio and Largitio scenes; the different heights; raggedly trimmed edges, and wrap-</page><page sequence="26">268 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 around arrangement of the two processions; the repairs and iconography of the battle scenes; and damage and Late An- tique repairs to all the reliefs. Since the Oratio represents the Tetrarchic five-column monument in the background, the carving cannot predate the Constantinian reuse by many years, which suggests that a monument of Maxentius (306-312) may have been the source. The iconography of the processions suggests a Tetrarchic monument parallel to the Arch of Galerius in Thessaloniki. SESSION V-R: GREEK SANCTUARIES THE ARCHAIC SANCTUARY OF ATHENA NIKE AT ATHENS: Ira S. Mark, University of Chicago Recent findings in the Sanctuary of Athena Nike at Athens have substantially clarified the history of the cult in the Archaic period. Earlier reports by this speaker have es- tablished that the small predecessor to the Nike Temple, the poros naiskos, often considered Archaic, dates in fact from the mid-fifth century (AJA 84 [1980] 222; 85 [1981] 206). The poros repository found in a corner of the naiskos, often labeled a ground altar (eschara), has been shown to be from the base for the cult statue of Athena Nike (XIIe Congres International d'Archeologie Classique, Athens 1983). The remains preserve the plinth cutting for the statue and point to a date for the work in the early sixth century. The present report announces further findings. The "Mycenaean" stonework of the bastion is seen to fall in two periods. The lower two-thirds of the bastion is formed of massive boulders, typically 0.5-1.0 m in height, set in a mor- tar of gray clayey earth. The upper meter of stonework on the west and stretches of the crown on the north and south are built of smaller blocks, 0.2-0.4 m in height, set dry. This later crown, Late Geometric to Middle Archaic in date, ap- pears to have restored the bastion to an even terrace follow- ing a major Dark Age collapse. The stonework of the crown and the remains from the cult statue base throw new light on perhaps the best known of the pre-Persian finds from the bastion, the inscribed block from an altar of Athena Nike. The altar, the statue base, and the reterracing point together to a major renewal of the cult; the statue base (600-560 B.C.) and altar (580-530) fix the dating limits of this renewal at 580-560. There is no direct evidence of earlier cult. The newly identified terrac- ing, however, suggests that any putative earlier worship would have been in the open air on the sloping fill of the collapsed bastion; the stage of 580-560 raises the bastion lit- erally from ruins. Scholars have often associated the in- scribed altar with the inauguration of the cult of Athena Nike. The identification of the bastion reterracing and the cult statue base strengthens this conclusion. THE BUILDING OF THE ERECHTHEION AND IG 13, 132: Joanne M. Spurza, Princeton University While inscriptions (IG I3, 474-79) tell us that the final phase of work on the Erechtheion took place in the last decade of the fifth century B.C., comparable epigraphical evidence for the beginning of the building has been missing. As a result, proposals for the initial phase depended upon historical argument and ranged from ca. 435 B.C. to 421 B.C. A new interpretation of the decree IG I1, 132 shows it to record the start of work on a temple that can be identified with the Erechtheion. The decree can be dated ca. 425 B.C. Enough remains of this 11-line fragment in the British Museum to indicate that its subject is an Athenian temple- building project. Parallels with other building accounts show that it concerns the beginning, rather than resumption of the enterprise. The date of IG 13, 132 has long been equated with that of the Mytilene decree (IG I3, 66): both cite Smikythos as presiding epistates. The Mytilene inscrip- tion was once assumed to refer to the settlement between Athens and Lesbos immediately after the revolt of 428/7 B.C. However, a growing body of scholarship recognizes that its conciliatory terms reflect some passage of time after the revolt and a later date of ca. 425 B.C. Previously, the unnamed temple under construction in IG 11, 132 has been identified as the Hephaisteion, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the Erechtheion. If the date of the decree is ca. 425, as now seems most likely, the Hephais- teion and the Athena Nike Temple must be eliminated as possible candidates on chronological grounds; the decree can be related to the Erechtheion with greater confidence. A starting date of ca. 425 B.C. for the Erechtheion gives stronger support to the standard stylistic assessment of its ar- chitectural features, as a chronological successor to the Nike Temple in the development of the Ionic order. This later date also implies that the lavish attention accorded the other building projects on the Akropolis was not so belated as often thought for this most venerable of Athenian cult sites. AUGUSTUS AND THE EARLY IMPERIAL CULT IN ATHENS: Michael Hoff, Tulane University It has long been known that active cult worship of Augus- tus existed in Athens, but its scope has never been defined. The most prominent known monument for the early imperial cult is the diminutive Temple of Roma and Augus- tus on the Akropolis. Its small size, however, precludes the notion that the temple served as the focus for cult worship, and a qualifying phrase from its dedicatory inscription sug- gests another cult center may be located elsewhere in the city. One possibility that has been suggested is an annex constructed at the rear of the Stoa of Zeus Eleutherios in the Agora, but its position there affords no architectural focus to this important and nascent cult. A more suitable possibility may be the unidentified build- ing immediately to the east of the Augustan Market. Much of the facade consisting of arcuated doorways still remains, and the exterior wall foundations indicate a substantial building. This structure was believed to have been the Ago- ranomion, but Travlos demonstrated that it cannot be the office of market officials. Instead its relationship to the ad- joining Market which itself serves architecturally as a fore- court to the arcuated building, its placement on a high po- dium to increase its prominence over the Market, and its partially preserved dedicatory inscription in which Augus- tus, Livia, and Athena are named dedicatees suggest that the building was a sebasteion dedicated to the Augustan cult.</page><page sequence="27">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 269 In support of this claim are numerous altars of Augustus found in proximity to the Market-Sebasteion complex. Two FOURTH-CENTURY B.C. BUILDINGS AT THE AR- GIVE HERAION: Christopher A. Pfaff, New York University As generally perceived, the architectural development of the Argive Heraion is characterized by precocious undertak- ings in the Archaic period and an ambitious program of ex- pansion in the second half of the fifth century B.C. With the completion of the Classical temple at the end of the fifth cen- tury the sanctuary is thought to enter a period of architec- tural quiescence. New observations at the Heraion, how- ever, indicate that two subsidiary buildings at the west side of the sanctuary were built during the fourth century B.C. The buildings, although excavated with the rest of the site in the 1890s, have been almost totally ignored. The first of these buildings, the "Lower Stoa," is a large L-shaped structure which, despite its name, is published by E.L. Tilton (in C. Waldstein et al., The Argive Heraeum I, 136) as a closed building. Reexamination of the foundations of this building and the identification of unpublished frag- ments of its superstructure indicate that the building was, after all, probably a stoa and that it had a Doric order with a three-metope system on the exterior and an Ionic colonnade on the interior. The style of the one preserved Ionic capital and the profile of the crowning moldings of the geisa suggest that this building belongs in the first half of the fourth cen- tury B.C. The second building is a rectangular hall with six interi- or supports and a doorway on its east side. The extension of the foundation of the building's east wall southward beyond the line of its south wall indicates that the plan originally included an ancillary room or possibly a porch on the south side. In the original publication (Ibid. 134-35) a fragment of a pebble mosaic with a wave pattern is associated with the building, but no elements of its superstructure. It is now possible to associate an unpublished Ionic geison block and an anta capital illustrated but not identified in Heraeum I, pl. XXIX.F. The profile of the distinctive hawksbeak-ca- vetto crowning molding of these elements indicates a fourth- century B.C. date. Unfortunately, the specific function of the two buildings discussed here cannot be demonstrated, but despite this shortcoming, they provide important evidence for the history of the sanctuary, indicating that the expansion witnessed by the fifth century continued into the fourth. MOVABLE FEASTS AND SANCTUARIES: THE CASE OF NEMEAN ZEUS: Naomi J. Norman, University of Georgia When Pausanias visited the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea, he mentioned that the temple there was worth seeing, though roofless and bereft of its cult statue. Later, in his chapters on Argos, he briefly describes a Nemean Zeus hieron complete with a cult statue, or agalma near that city's agora. This paper suggests that the agalma seen by Pausa- nias at Argos was in fact the cult statue from the main tem- ple to Zeus at nearby Nemea. It is well known that the cele- bration of the Nemean festival and games was on several occasions transferred out of Nemea and into Argos for vari- ous reasons, including political considerations. It is more than likely that, during one of these periodic transfers, the cult statue was also moved to Argos to characterize the pass- ing of control of the games from Kleonai to its arch rival Argos. Recent excavations by the French in the Argive agora, however, suggest that more than the cult statue and athletic competitions may have moved to Argos. These exca- vations suggest that the Argives attempted to transfer the idea of the entire Nemean sanctuary to their city and repli- cate as much of that sanctuary as possible near their agora. Such a transfer of a complete sanctuary is not unique, the most notable example being the removal of the Zeus sanctu- ary from Mt. Lykaion into Megalopolis. This paper exam- ines these and other examples of such transfers and explores the political motivations for them, especially the role of the Macedonian family. AN UNDERGROUND CULT TUNNEL AT ISTHMIA: Birgit- ta Lindros Wohl, California State University at Northridge During the 1970-1971 excavations at the Poseidon sanc- tuary at Isthmia, the UCLA team investigated a habitation area rich in lamps, pottery and coins, primarily used in the second, third, and fourth centuries and still awaiting publi- cation. One part deserves particular attention: an 11-meter- long subterranean tunnel, cut in stereo with entrance shafts at each end. Coins date the prime use from the late second to early fourth century. The unusual space and the material recovered stand out remarkably. Lamps are elaborate, of unusual size and some unique (i.a., three multi-nozzle lamps, including a corona with plastic decor and a square type with large figure field). Pottery also attracts attention (a vessel with plastic decor of snakes and grapes and another with grapes only). The thrust of the material thus points to a special func- tion of the complex, suggesting religious use. The identity of the cult may remain uncertain, but parallels for physical layout, content of finds, and iconography are brought together and discussed. Tentative conclusions consider Mithras and Dionysos, but a cult of more local nature can- not be excluded, as the tunnel falls in line with several dis- crete cult areas in that part of the sanctuary, previously ex- cavated. The tunnel complex is therefore of great interest also for a fuller picture of the sanctuary as a whole. SESSION V-S: JOINT SESSION OF THE AMER- ICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA: THE CHALLENGE OF THE TEXT: THEORY AND PRACTICE THERE'S CONTEXT AND THERE'S CONTEXT AND THERE'S CONTEXT: How TO INTERPRET A (MYCE- NAEAN) TEXT: Thomas G. Palaima, University of Texas at Austin</page><page sequence="28">270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 How does the study of Mycenaean inscriptions compare with work on Classical texts and alphabetic inscriptions? Housman defines Classical textual criticism as "the science of discovering error in texts and the art of removing it," an intellectual process "not susceptible of hard-and-fast rules," and the results of which could be confirmed only by "the production of the author's autograph." Thus, "criticus nas- citur, non fit" (Classical Papers [Cambridge 1972] 1058- 62). But after birth the textual critic must prepare himself to apply his science: he must know palaeography, manuscript tradition, language; he must be thoroughly familiar with his text, the meaning of its contents, its place in the corpus of its author, in the development of its genre, and in contemporary and past literary tradition. He must care to know everything relevant to the text. He must develop and use his critical instincts. Study of inscriptions, syllabic or alphabetic, seems a lower calling. Yet the prerequisites are the same, because of Vanderpool's law: "It's easy to read an inscription if you know what it says." One critic detects error because he knows by carefully cultivated instinct what an author would or would not have written; the other reads or restores what is or should be or once was on stone or clay because similarly developed instincts guide him. Both need a supreme under- standing of contexts. There is one primary difference: Linear B texts (and most alphabetic inscriptions) are autograph texts. There is a second and paradoxical difference: we have no autographs. All Mycenaean texts are anonymous, and authorship is as- signed by palaeographical and archival analysis, after which the process of critical interpretation begins. The Mycenaean pinacologist (and the alphabetic epigrapher) then is con- cerned chiefly with producing a precise transcription of an autograph text, not with the detection and removal of subse- quent corruption. There are, however, some attempts to re- construct "archetypes," i.e., to reconstruct theoretical "origi- nal texts" which are the presumed sources, textual or oral, for the information recorded on particular Linear B records; and occasionally it is meaningful and possible to establish a probable sequence of texts and sets of texts and/or the de- pendency of one text or set upon another. The contents of the Mycenaean texts ally them with documentary papyri and certain kinds of alphabetic inscriptions (mainly those stripped of any contextual information provided by pre- scripts or postscripts). The pinacologist must concern himself with interpreta- tion of the text at hand even in working toward a transcrip- tion. Like the epigrapher and textual critic, he presents his results according to prescribed conventions. But the actual process of interpretation is instinctive. He is just as much a trained dog as Housman's metaphorical textual scholar, al- beit a dog leading, for the most part, a flea-free existence. Vanderpool's law makes him a Housmanian hound. He must refine his instincts and sensitivity to the same degree as Housman's textual canes critici. He must have a complete grasp of a different set of contexts, some of which he shares with the epigrapher: archaeological, palaeographical/archi- val, textual (series, corpus, subject field), linguistic, and his- torical-and no doubt others which I have not formulated. Each type of context has peculiarities and special problems and delicacies which set it off from those pertaining to Clas- sical texts and alphabetic inscriptions, and vice versa. I think therefore that it will be of interest to students of all three specialties to discuss contextual problems associated with two new texts: TH Ps 1 and CR Vs 1460. That is the purpose of this paper. FACETS OF EVIDENCE: THE INSCRIPTIONS OF ANCIENT POMPEII: James L. Franklin, Jr., Indiana Univer- sity In the course of the excavations of ancient Pompeii, thou- sands of pieces of writing in the forms of inscriptions, graffi- ti, campaign posters, shipping labels, and even fragments of business records have been recorded. These have been peri- odically collected in various volumes of CIL and now consti- tute the largest surviving assemblage of documentation at- testing the life and customs of the early Roman Empire. Yet this material has lain largely unstudied by any but basic methodologies, whereas even knowledge of findspots and topography offers new insights into the functioning of the ancient city. Graffiti, for example, tend to be clustered, either because a dawdler writes more than one or because one graffito elic- its another as reply or comment. Specific topographical fea- tures, too, attract graffiti because of their trafficked, public nature. A wall backing a tiny piazzetta along one of Pom- peii's busier streets, for example, served as a sort of commu- nity bulletin board, carrying not only campaign posters and announcements of approaching gladiatorial games, but also many personal comments. New approaches to study of all the writing of ancient Pompeii focus not on the writing itself, but on the ways its content and location ricochet to explain the physical sur- roundings and explicate aspects of life. In recent years cog- nitive geographers have shown how the mental maps of in- dividuals vary from physical reality and in consequence af- fect behavior; in the absence of living commentators, the writing of ancient Pompeii can provide similar insights for the students of ancient urbanism. THE CHALLENGE OF THE FRAGMENT: A NEW EPHEBIC TEXT FROM ATHENS: Stephen V. Tracy, Ohio State University The remarks which follow are intended to show the un- initiated that there is nothing very mysterious about editing an inscription and lay out with clear examples the major steps and common pitfalls. The most important task of the editor of an editio princeps is to give a text which presents as accurately as possible the letters and parts of letters actually legible. Just above the text at the left he should provide as precise a date for the fragment as he can and at the right an estimate of the letters per line. Restorations which the editor regards as reasonably certain appear in the text in square brackets; all other supplements belong in the commentary. The text is preceded by a complete physical description in- cluding the date and place of discovery. One or more clearly legible photographs of the inscribed surface with a scale should accompany every first edition. Following the text comes the commentary in which partially preserved letters are described, as well as erasures, and other pertinent tech- nical matters. Names of persons or partially preserved</page><page sequence="29">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 271 names are also to be treated as fully as possible. Finally the editor should discuss the date, type, and import of the text. Thanks to the kindness of T.L. Shear, Jr., a previously unpublished fragment from the American Excavations in the Athenian Agora, inv. no. I 7160, is presented in illustra- tion. The following is a first, preliminary text in capitals: IM EI7OT....... .IEN.

Most, Uni- versity of Innsbruck Although from earliest times the Greeks showed great in- terest in texts conceived as challenges to action and under- standing (oracles, riddles, maxims), the earliest demonstra- tion of the mechanisms by which "normal" texts can be trans- formed into a challenge, and the challenge met, is Plato's Pro- tagoras. Protagoras's strategic problematization of Simoni- des' poem neglects its original situation of performance and proceeds by isolating two phrases from their context and con- struing a contradiction between them; Socrates' eventual re- sponse tries to disarm the challenge by recontextualizing the phrases within the poem and the poem itself within Socratic doctrine and an invented literary-historical scenario. Usually it is not texts themselves that pose the most per- plexing challenges, but uncertainties concerning their con- texts: texts become a challenge by becoming decontextual- ized, and efforts to meet their challenge attempt to recontex- tualize them. Though a text may have been conceived within the limits of a particular occasion, if it is literary it will exceed them and invite the new contextualizations of unin- tended applications. With time, original contexts tend to be lost and unimagined recontextualizations to proliferate; in the case of the Classics, not only specific circumstances have been lost, but whole cultures. Interpretation is just this elab- oration of hypothetically determinate contexts: however cautious and self-doubting, it remains speculative and risky. It is guided by four methodological prejudices: 1) economy (the thriftier the use of present material and the fewer the added hypotheses the t"tter); 2) scope (the broader the range of possible appl ion the better); 3) parallelism (in a fragmentarily transmitted dead culture, only parallels can provide cogent evidence, but most parallels are unrecover- able); 4) centripetality (within domains of hierarchical proximity, the closer the better). These rules need have nothing to do with the truth of the matter: they structure the discourse of philology. Interpretations of both "Scopas" and the Protagoras have often been haunted by unresolved issues of context. Simoni- des' poem was indeed detached early from Socrates' exege- sis; but very few scholars have been willing to dispute the premise, shared by Protagoras and Socrates, that its true subject is arete, and those who have, have not yet provided convincing alternative contexts for it. Within the dialogue, the Simonides episode is generally taken to be a mere diver- sion on Protagoras's part and an amusing digression on Pla- to's: but recognition of Plato's emphasis upon the pragmat- ics of discourse about the good and upon the issue of the teachability of virtue may permit a better understanding of its role within the context of the dialogue. A more suspicious attention to the challenge of contexts may help us to restore the rhetoric of "Scopas" (how to flatter an unpopular pa- tron) and the pedagogy of the Protagoras (what rules should govern discussions of moral issues)-and to problematize the pragmatics of our own interpretation, which adapts So- crates' method of contextualization but Protagoras's goal of linking literature and moral thought. SESSION VI-K: AEGEAN PREHISTORY HERDING AND MAGIC: NEOLITHIC ECONOMY AND ZOOMORPHIC IMAGES IN SOUTHERN GREECE: Lau- ren E. Talalay, University of Michigan Although the study of figurines from Stone Age Greece has generated valuable discussion in recent years, attention has focused on anthropomorphic images. Non-human (i.e., zoomorphic) images have been largely ignored. As this pa- per argues, however, animal figurines can provide new and important insight into changing economic patterns. Whereas anthropomorphic figurines occur throughout the Neolithic in southern Greece, zoomorphic images are principally confined to the final phase of the period. This paper suggests that the sudden and puzzling appearance of such figurines can best be explained by examining two sepa- rate pieces of evidence: the ethnographic literature on ani- mal figurines and the herding strategies practiced during the latter part of the Neolithic. Ethnographic studies document that one of the functions of small zoomorphic pieces is to promote health and propa- gation among local herds (either on a regular basis or in times of economic stress). The appearance of comparable figurines during the Final Neolithic may reflect analogous purposes and, therefore, may hint at shifts in local hunting or herding practices. As items of sympathetic magic, zoo- morphic figurines would help ensure the success of newly adopted strategies. Support for this hypothesis is found in the archaeological record. Current evidence suggests that the Late and Final Neolithic are, in fact, marked by increased dependence on a more mobile pastoral system. The appearance of animal fig- urines in southern Greece is, therefore, best viewed as part of a larger economic picture which entailed changes in animal management during the terminal phase of the Neolithic.</page><page sequence="30">272 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 LERNA IV SETTLEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND ARCHI- TECTURE: Elizabeth C. Banks, University of Kansas After the destruction of the EB II House of the Tiles at Lerna, the EB III settlement developed along lines quite dif- ferent from those of its predecessor and provides the best example currently available in the Argolid of settlement type and variety of architectural form in this important peri- od. A large apsidal posthole house touching the periphery of the tumulus overlying the House of the Tiles appears as the nucleus of activity in early Lerna IV.1, and with it were associated smaller structures and at least one outlying indus- trial area. Subsequently a series of more substantial apsidal buildings was constructed in approximately the same loca- tion as the first, and other buildings of various forms were associated with these as the area of the tumulus was gradu- ally covered with structures in the course of Lerna IV.2 and Lerna IV.3. Represented among the forms, in addition to apsidal buildings both large and small, were trapezoidal structures, a small megaron with a forecourt and at least one D-shaped building. In the later stages of the Fourth Settle- ment the proliferation of apsidal buildings with their depen- dencies and the nature of the material found with them sug- gest that the site was inhabited by closely related groups whose livelihood depended upon the farming of the sur- rounding plain and some kinds of industrial activities, in- cluding the working of bronze, considerable evidence for which was found in the course of the excavations. THE ROLE OF DIRECT EXCHANGE IN THE MYCENAEAN PALACE ECONOMY: Ruth Palmer, College of Wooster This paper proposes the existence in the Mycenaean economy of a complementary system of distribution charac- terized by the transaction term o-no. The Linear B tablets present extensive evidence for a redistributive network based in part upon status and its attendant benefits and obli- gations. A parallel system of distribution based on the direct exchange of goods and labor is suggested by the few tablets listing the term o-no-exchange. In PY An 35 and Un 443, o-no means "price" as the term connects goods of equivalent value. But in Un 1322.1-3, no exchange commodity is listed; instead the occupation of the recipient is emphasized, and linked by o-no to a quantity of grain and figs. Could o- no in this context, without accompanying exchange com- modity, signify a direct exchange of labor for goods? A sys- tem of wage labor has advantages in that the administration can enlarge or diminish the work force according to need. In contrast, the dependent women and children in the Ab tab- lets, although receiving only subsistence rations, must be supported by the palace whether or not they are working. The tablets which record goods given as o-no are tempo- rary documents representing only part of the transaction; the full details would have been preserved in a more perma- nent form. By their very nature, records of direct exchange would be simpler and therefore less numerous than those calculating the levying and distribution of goods and labor based on the obligations of the donors and recipients. The existence of these o-no tablets indicates that transactions based on direct exchange of goods and labor existed in the palace economy, and probably played a greater role in the redistributive system than the extant documents show. HITTITES IN THE MYCENAEAN WORLD, AND VICE VERSA: Eric Cline, University of Pennsylvania This study attempts to take a balanced look at Hittite ob- jects in the LH III Mycenaean world and Mycenaean ob- jects in the Hittite homelands of Central Anatolia, and seeks to provide rational hypotheses to account for the observable lack of such objects. It is apparent that Hittite objects are rare in LH III contexts within the Aegean, numbering nine at the most. Mycenaean artifacts are similarly infrequent in Central Anatolia, having been found only at Masat, Frak- tin, and possibly Bo'hazkiy. Literary references and possi- ble influences on either side are equally scarce. These few evidences are not in themselves sufficient to support the premise of extensive trade between Hittites and Myce- naeans. The hypotheses that the current situation is merely temporary, to be resolved by further excavation, that these two powers had never heard of each other and were never in contact, or that geographic or demographic factors limited or even prevented trade can probably be dismissed. It seems most likely that Hittite-Mycenaean trade, if such existed, was in perishable or "invisible" goods, which will have left few traces in the archaeological record. Alternatively, how- ever, one might tentatively suggest a deliberate policy, a trade embargo, initiated more likely by the Hittites than by the Mycenaeans. The Tudhaliya IV-Sausgamuwa of Amurru treaty of the 13th century B.C. and the selective distribution of Mycenaean pottery elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean provide evidence that such policies did exist in the ancient world. A CACHE OF MYCENAEAN AND CYPRIOT POTTERY FROM KALAVASOS-AYIos DHIMITRIOS, CYPRUS: Pamela J. Russell, Emory University Museum In August of 1987, during the seventh season of excava- tion at Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, Cyprus, an important, concentrated deposit of over 150 vessels was discovered in the presumed palace (Building X) of this Late Bronze Age town. The town, one of the largest settlements of the Late Cypriot IIC period (13th century B.C.), prospered probably as a result of the exploitation of nearby copper resources. It was abandoned around 1200 B.C., a time when many other major centers in Cyprus suffered destructions or similar abandonments. The ceramic group excavated in 1987 was apparently de- posited over a short period of time at the very end of the occupation of the town. The pots were found in a stone-lined well or pit in Area 173, a small paved room in the eastern part of Building X. Over half of the vessels (about 60%) are of Mycenaean type while the remainder are of typically Cypriot wares (White Slip II, Base Ring II, Plain White, and Coarse Monochrome). Of the Mycenaean type vessels the most common shape is the shallow bowl, usually deco- rated with horizontal banding. Several bowls have details in added white paint and three have figural decoration (birds</page><page sequence="31">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 273 and fish). Many small Mycenaean cups also occur. No deep bowls or skyphoi are represented in the group. This ceramic deposit is important for three reasons. First, it differs radically from all other ceramic deposits at Kalava- sos-Ayios Dhimitrios both in the number of complete vessels and in the high proportion of Mycenaean pottery. Secondly, a comparison with other major groups of late 13th-century B.C. pottery from Cyprus provides new information regard- ing the relative sequence of destructions and abandonments of sites during the transition from the LC IIC to LC IIIA period. Lastly, because examples of fine quality bowls, usu- ally considered products of the Greek mainland, and lesser quality bowls of presumably Cypriot manufacture (White Painted Wheelmade III ware) occur together, the deposit forms a perfect group for establishing guidelines for distin- guishing local Mycenaean type vessels from imported ones. FEMALE RIDERS SEATED SIDE-SADDLE: REVIVAL OF AN ICONOGRAPHIC TYPE: Mary E. Voyatzis, University of Arizona The sudden growth of popularity enjoyed by Greek sanc- tuaries in the second half of the eighth century is shown by a marked increase in the number of dedications offered at these sites. Among the votives were a small number of bronze female riders seated side-saddle on horses found at Olympia, Samos, Tegea and Lousoi. More typical offerings for this period were individual bronze horse or human figu- rines produced in great abundance for dedication in their own right or as attachments for tripod cauldrons. In con- trast, the statuettes of female riders seated side-saddle were neither so common as these standard bronze votives nor so widespread in distribution. The relatively unusual pose of these riders and the nature and extent of their dispersal sug- gest that they were intended to represent a special type of female whose significance was rooted in the Bronze Age. Depictions of female riders seated side-saddle on quadru- peds are known from 13th-century B.C. contexts. Numer- ous seal engravings and terracottas representing such figures were found at various sites on Crete and the mainland. A terracotta female of psi-type seated in this pose from a chamber tomb in Attica possibly portrays a goddess. A Lin- ear B tablet from the palace at Pylos referring to a "Potnia of the Horse" may relate to these riders as well. The extent of the representations of such female riders in Late Myce- naean times indicates the importance of the type, which con- ceivably depicted a deity. The reappearance of females seated side-saddle on horses in bronze at a limited number of eighth-century sanctuaries may signify both a survival of some memory of a Late Bronze Age goddess, retained in Arcadia and Samos, as well as a tangible revival of an iconographic type popular in the 13th century B.C. The offering of these figurines at certain shrines, dedicated to Athena, Artemis, and Hera, may imply a degree of ambiguity in the nature of the goddesses wor- shipped at these sites in the eighth century B.C. By Archaic times, however, when riders seated side-saddle were made in terracotta and had a much wider distribution, these figu- rines had become more firmly associated with Hera, Arte- mis, and Helen. KOUKLIA SKALES: EVIDENCE FOR KINGSHIP IN GEO- METRIC BURIALS? Margaret E. Morden, University of Michigan Recent and thorough publication of the cemetery site of Kouklia Skales by Karageorghis has led Coldstream and Rupp to reexamine the question of when kingships first arose on Cyprus. Coldstream has postulated that kingships first arose in the Late Bronze Age, in accordance with the later literary tradition, and continued uninterrupted into the Early Iron Age. Rupp, however, argues for a discontinuity of these kingships with their reemergence late in the Geo- metric period. My work on this same material has led me to reconsider the suppositions of these scholars' work and to suggest alternative explanations. Kouklia Skales was an elite cemetery for Palaepaphos. Its major period of use was Cypro-Geometric when multiple inhumation chamber tombs were the primary burial forms. Many of the burials included luxury items, foreign imports, or merely large numbers of tomb gifts which have been used as indicators of the high status of the tomb occupants. The question is not whether this information can tell us some- thing about social complexity or political institutions but whether the evidence is detailed enough to tell us about the existence of specific political institutions like kingship. Changes in the wealth in tombs could be a response to fluc- tuations in microeconomics, shifts in local political control, or changes in the climate of international affairs. I attempt to call into question the use of this particular archaeological evidence to infer kingship without the aid of the literary testimony and I suggest that we must be content to speak only about ranked elite societies. SESSION VI-L: WESTERN ASIA MINOR AND GREECE NEW LYDIAN HOUSES AT SARDIS: Nicholas Cahill, University of California at Berkeley Recent excavation at the foot of a monumental Lydian building at Sardis has exposed parts of two well-preserved houses of the sixth century B.C. These houses had been burned and then buried beneath a thick layer of brick from the colossal building, probably in the capture of Sardis by Cyrus between 547 and 541 B.C. (AJA 90 [1986] 419-24; BASOR Suppl. 25 [1987] 13-92). Their architecture and contents thus remain almost intact; the catastrophe gives us a uniquely detailed picture of Lydian houses and domestic assemblages. The excavated portion of one house consists of a general- purpose room with a hearth, cooking utensils, serving pot- tery, and stored food, as well as a loom and clusters of per- sonal items (cosmetics containers, jewelry, astragaloi, etc.). By contrast, the rooms of the second house are more special- ized. One room was devoted entirely to the preparation of food, with a hearth for baking (burning dung, rather than charcoal), a second hearth for other purposes, and an area just outside for boiling or stewing. A grinding bench with saddle querns, cooking and serving vessels, and other kit- chen artifacts complete the furnishings of the kitchen.

Finally, an adjoining room, proba- bly belonging to this house, was a glass workshop; its con- tents, unfortunately disturbed, included 5 kg of opaque red glass cullet and a few finished artifacts and tools. LYDIAN MASONRY AND MONUMENTAL ARCHITEC- TURE AT SARDIS: Christopher Ratte, University of California at Berkeley The role played by ashlar masonry in the architecture of Archaic Lydia has interested scholars for over a century (overview of the subject and scholarship in G.M.A. Hanf- mann, Sardis from Prehistoric to Roman Times [Cambridge, Mass. 1983] 42-71). Until recently, Lydian ashlar masonry seemed to be reserved almost exclusively for tombs. The one exceptional instance of ashlar construction in the "public" architecture of Sardis, the Lydian capital, was a series of terrace walls just below the summit of the acropolis. In the last decade, three other monumental terraces or platforms clad in ashlar masonry have been discovered in different parts of the city site; two of these terraces are strati- graphically dated to the middle or first half of the sixth cen- tury B.C. This new evidence enables us to form a more bal- anced view not only of the character of Lydian masonry and of its role in Lydian architecture overall, but also of the rela- tionships between the Lydian building tradition and archi- tecture in other regions both east and west of Lydia. Similarities between Lydian building technology and construction methods in Greek architecture are too close to be accidental. In related fields such as sculpture and the pro- duction of terracotta roof tiles, Lydia's dependence on Greece is clear. Factors such as the chronology of the Lydian monuments and their architectural typology suggest, how- ever, that the development of Lydian ashlar masonry was at least in some respects independent of Greek influence. An investigation of other potential sources of influence leads to the Levant, raising the possibility that Lydia may have helped transmit techniques of construction from the Near East and Egypt to Greece. A DEMETER SANCTUARY ON THE ACROPOLIS OF MYTI- LENE: Hector Williams, University of British Co- lumbia Since 1984 annual excavations carried out by the Univer- sity of British Columbia-under the auspices of the Cana- dian Archaeological Institute at Athens with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada-have been uncovering elements of a sanctuary to Demeter and Kore in the Mediaeval castle that now occu- pies the ancient acropolis of Mytilene. Two large altars (a hearth altar and a prothysis altar side by side) have been discovered along with the remains of numerous bones of young sheep and pigs, hundreds of votive figurines (many similar to those from Demeter sanctuaries at Troy and Per- gamon), hundreds of miniature hydriai, several kernoi, hun- dreds of lamps (including a large deposit of late Classical/ early Hellenistic times), and a lead curse tablet. The sanctu- ary appears to have functioned from the fourth century B.C. to the first century A.C., and in spite of its prominent posi- tion on top of the acropolis had not been previously attested through literary, epigraphic, or archaeological sources. Es- pecially interesting is the apparent joint worship with Cy- bele attested by tile fragments inscribed MATROO. Besides presenting the site and the finds, this paper will also put the Mytilene Thesmophorion in the context of other Demeter sanctuaries from the eastern Aegean (Troy, Pergamon, Mi- letus, Iasos, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, Chios, etc.). THE STANFORD SKOURTA PLAIN PROJECT: THE 1987 AND 1988 SEASONS OF SURVEY ON THE ATTIC-BoIo- TIAN FRONTIER: Mark H. Munn and Mary Lou Zimmerman Munn, Stanford University The fortress of Panakton is known to have been an im- portant Athenian garrison post on the Boiotian frontier (Thucydides 5; Demosthenes 19, 52; inscriptions from Eleusis). The location of Panakton has, however, been the subject of scholarly dispute for over two centuries. Vander- pool (CSCA 11, 1976) has presented evidence favoring the identification of Panakton with the fort above Kavasala (Prasino) in the Skourta plain. Others regard the fort at Gyphtokastro, also known as Eleutherai, to be Panakton, leaving the Kavasala fort to be regarded as an unidentified Boiotian settlement. Our discovery, in 1988, of a fragmen- tary Athenian ephebic decree of the tribe Leontis, from the later fourth century B.C., at the Kavasala fort now proves that this was an Athenian garrison post, and therefore must be Panakton. This proof firmly establishes the historical context for the archaeological evidence we are gathering in our intensive surface survey of the Skourta plain. In this sec- ond interim report on our project we shall focus on Classical Panakton, and on the nature of Athenian interests in the upland frontier region protected by the fortress. The role of this garrison post can be understood only in the context of the settlement history of the mountain plain it overlooks. From the 10th until the fifth century B.C. there was no substantial permanent settlement in the plain. The testimony of Thucydides indicates that the area was used as open upland pasturage by Boiotians and Athenians. By the mid-fifth century, however, the Athenians were exerting an exclusive claim on the area. The fortress of Panakton was built at this time, securing for the Athenians what had been the main settlement site in the area during the Middle and Late Bronze and early Dark Ages. A sizable open settlement at Ayios Dimitrios, discovered in 1987, demonstrates that the Athenians were interested in the agricultural potential of the plain. After the interruption of the Peloponnesian War, this trend continued well into the third century B.C., as individual farmsteads and small settlements became more numerous. A Boiotian reaction in the fourth century is dem- onstrated by the establishment of the Tsoukrati and Limiko towers to the north and east of the plain. These two moun- taintop watchtowers, generally assumed to be Athenian, are of a design common to several other Boiotian watchtowers, and are to be identified as Boiotian works of the 340s. This conclusion makes it possible to locate a section of the Attic- Boiotian border of the fourth century.

Keller, Indiana Univer- sity The Canadian-Karystia Project has completed an inten- sive survey of the Paximadhi peninsula, southwest of mod- ern Karystos, Euboea. This is an area of 22 km2 which has not been disturbed by modern landscape alteration. The survey located two hamlet-size settlements and approxi- mately 30 farmsteads of Classical date. Very few post-Clas- sical sites were recorded and the extensive terracing in the area appears to be associated with the Classical farmsteads. At one farm site the remains of a perimeter wall enclosed an area of 9 ha. The distribution of the other farmsteads is con- sistent with a value of 9-10 ha. for the size of each farm- stead. There is an in situ olive press stone at one farm and several farmhouses have associated threshing floors. The excavation of one Classical farmhouse revealed a 8.50 x 14 m structure consisting of four 3 x 4 m rooms ar- ranged north and east of a 3 x 8 m courtyard. The artifacts recovered included millstone fragments and a variety of coarse, plain, and fine ware pottery. These finds, as well as a number of cist graves found associated with other farm- steads, indicate year-round habitation of the farmsteads. Although the information recorded on the Paximadhi peninsula may pertain to a unique situation (a suspected Athenian cleruchy settlement), the evidence for year-round habitation, the size of the farmsteads, the percentage of the farm properties terraced for agriculture, the artifact assem- blage from the excavated farmhouse, and other information should be considered in the growing debate concerning the nature of rural settlement patterns and agricultural prac- tices in Classical Greece. ATHENIAN SETTLEMENTS IN EUBOIA IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C.: Malcolm B. Wallace, University of Toronto Scholars have traditionally distinguished two types of Athenian outsettlement, the colony and the cleruchy, though the exact nature of the difference has seen much discussion. This paper suggests a somewhat different approach; for brevity, it concentrates on the settlements in Euboia. As each settlement required discussion and an initiating decree in the Athenian Assembly, and as what evidence we have sug- gests that these decrees were tailored to the particular situa- tions, it is better to think not of a dichotomy between two official types of settlement but of a range from, e.g., the foundation of the state of Thurii, with a complete set of its own institutions and laws and no restrictions on its auto- nomy, to, e.g., the planting of a small group of Athenians on the territory of Karystos (see D.R. Keller and M.B. Wal- lace, EchCl N.S. 5 [1986] 155-59). Histiaia, for example, even if we do not accept as secure all the recent restorations in IG I3, 41, lies in several respects between the two. We may also distinguish between settlements imposed at the ex- pense of defeated enemies and apparently peaceful enter- prises (none in Euboia) and between those that had as a ma- jor purpose the strengthening of Athens' strategic and eco- nomic position, as at Chalkis (later termed one of the Fetters of Greece), and those that were largely for the enrichment of individual Athenians, as at Melos, though Histiaia and Ka- rystos both serve both purposes. A more nuanced view of Athenian outsettlement should result. AN INSCRIBED MONUMENT FROM THE EPIDAURIAN ASKLEPIEION: Robert Wagman, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Excavations at the Asklepieion of Epidauros have brought to light six inscriptions containing hymns to Askle- pios and other divinities. One of these is a wholly preserved, freestanding stele containing the well-known Paian to As- klepios by Isyllos of Epidauros (IG IV.I2, 128). The re- maining five inscriptions (IG IV.I2, 129-35; SEG 30, 390) are perhaps less well known and certainly less well pre- served. Scholarly work has focused mainly on the text, paying little or no attention to the stones themselves. Yet the study of the stones' physical features presents us with a very interesting problem of architectural epigraphy. I argue that IG IV.I2, 129-35, SEG 30, 390 are components of the same inscribed monument or architectural structure. On the basis of the evidence examined, I propose a tentative reconstruc- tion of this monument and finally draw some inferences on the musical performances at the Asklepieion of Epidauros. SESSION VI-T: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: ROMAN COPIES OF GREEK CLASSICAL SCULP- TURE ROMAN COPIES OF GREEK MASTERPIECES AS EVI- DENCE FOR THE HISTORY OF ROMAN CREATIVE ART: Hugo Meyer, Princeton University The abstract for this paper was unavailable. THE LATERAN POSEIDON: THE CASE OF THE MISSING MASTERPIECE: Elizabeth Bartman, University of Pennsylvania Since its discovery near Ostia in the early 19th century, a colossal statue of Poseidon resting on one raised leg (Vatican Museums, inv. 10315) has been regarded as the most faith- ful replica of the statuary type it reproduces, the Lateran Poseidon. Some 30 replicas are linked with this typology, traditionally believed to reproduce a bronze statue cast by Lysippos in the fourth century B.C. Comparison of the vari- ous replicas, however, demonstrates a formal and icono- graphic diversity that would seem to preclude their deriva- tion from a single model. Nor is the Vatican statue, medio- cre in quality, convincing in its long-held role as the exem- plum of that lost model. Thus the evidence of the replicas challenges the sculptural paradigm formulated by Furt- wingler of a single Greek sculptural masterpiece spawning Roman copies. More probably, various images of Poseidon at rest, their distinct lineages untraceable today, circulated as part of the iconographic vocabulary of antiquity.</page><page sequence="34">276 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 CLASSICAL STATUES AS ROMAN HOUSEHOLD DECORA- TION: PSEUDO-CLASSICAL LAMP-HOLDERS: Christo- pher H. Hallett, University of California at Berkeley There is extant a number of high-quality lifesize bronzes, all representing nude youths, and all broadly speaking in the Classical style, which have long been recognized as adapted to hold lighting fixtures. Though some were once thought to be Greek originals, all are now generally accepted to be copies, or rather "eclectic combinations," of the Roman peri- od. And as "Roman creations in the Classical style" they have attracted a good deal of attention as valuable evidence for the aesthetic preferences of the Romans, since it has been suggested they provide an excellent indication of the various ways in which copies of Classical works were modified and "improved" to tailor them to Roman taste. This paper adds a further, previously unpublished, piece to the series and of- fers an alternative interpretation of the group, one which stresses rather the importance of their intended function (lamp-holders) and new context (a Roman triclinium) in determining their overall appearance. Finally it is argued that in this case-as perhaps elsewhere in the genre of Ro- man decorative copies-form follows function, rather than reflects an all-embracing "period taste." THE CHANGING FUNCTION OF SCULPTURE IN THE GREEK AND ROMAN PERIODS: L.-A. Touchette, St. John's College, Oxford University This paper calls for a reconsideration of the once ortho- dox view that Greek sculpture copied in the Roman period was art for art's sake. This bias has particularly plagued consideration of Neo-Attic reliefs. Thus, Neo-Attic reliefs have often been dismissed as purely decorative, just one ele- ment in the Roman connoisseur's decoration of his villa. Even a cursory look at W. Fuch's Die Vorbilder der neu- attischen Reliefs (Berlin 1959), however, reveals that all of the reliefs in the repertoire have a religious relevance. The gods and their followers appear in various guises. Reliefs from the decoration of cult statues are also represented. In this paper, Neo-Attic reliefs after Classical models, such as the dancing Maenads, the Saltantes Lacaenae, and the fig- ures from the Nike parapet, serve to illustrate the continued potency of the sacred imagery of the originals in the Roman period. Indeed, the religiosity implicit in the Classical proto- type is often made explicit in the Roman copies. It would be incorrect, therefore, to assume that in the Roman period these Classical reliefs were stripped of their original meaning and served as art in the strictest sense of the word. Yet, I do not mean to suggest that Neo-Attic re- liefs served a cultic function. Rather, I would posit that they represent one aspect of a generalized religious ambience. As Cicero's letters to Atticus reveal, the selection of sculpture was primarily dependent on its suitability or appropriate- ness. The unifying element of the Neo-Attic reliefs is their underlying religious symbolism. In the Roman period, a clear distinction was not made between the sacred and the secular; the two concepts were not mutually exclusive. The Neo-Attic reliefs, therefore, suggest wider implications for the function of Greek sculpture in the Roman period. SESSION VIII-A: EXCAVATION REPORTS- PREHISTORIC A PALAEOLITHIC SURVEY OF THESSALY, GREECE: RE- PORT ON THE 1987 AND 1988 SEASONS: Curtis Run- nels, Boston University To obtain a clear picture of pre-Neolithic Thessaly a sur- vey of the Larisa area for Palaeolithic and Mesolithic re- mains was undertaken in 1987. The banks and terrace sys- tem of the Peneios River were systematically searched along with those parts of Thessaly with deposits old enough to contain prehistoric artifacts. All caves and rock shelters in the survey area were also searched. In 1987, 32 findspots were discovered and more than 200 lithic artifacts were col- lected. Eighty per cent are from the terraces of the Peneios River or from the eroded banks of the riverbed. Other find- spots were centered around the villages of Megalo Monas- tiri and Eleftheri, south and east of Larisa. The lithic arti- facts are Middle and Upper Palaeolithic types, dated by their association with the fluviatile deposits exposed by downcutting of the river, and with the old terraces. Radio- metric dates for the fluviatile deposits indicate an age of 44-27 Kyr for the Palaeolithic finds. The Thessalian Pa- laeolithic industry (or industries) include an evolved Middle Palaeolithic Levallois-Mousterian facies with bifacial leaf- points, scrapers, Mousterian points, and denticulates, and an industry resembling the Aurignacian with endscrapers, burins, retouched blades, and rare bifacial leafpoints with rounded bases. The Thessalian materials resemble the Sze- letian of Hungary as described by Allsworth-Jones (The Szeletian and the Transition from Middle to Upper Paleo- lithic in Central Europe, Oxford 1986), and were perhaps produced by late Neanderthals in contact with an anatomi- cally modern human population. Late Upper Palaeolithic Epigravettian and Mesolithic industries were not identified in Thessaly, and the area was presumably uninhabited or little used from 27-9 Kyr. The Neolithic settlements of 9-5 Kyr must be regarded as intrusive. THE CASTELLUCCIAN VILLAGE AT LA MUCULUFA (LI- CATA, SICILY): Brian E. McConnell, Brown Uni- versity Excavation at La Muculufa since 1982 by the Center for Old World Archaeology and Art of Brown University for the Superintendency for Cultural and Environmental Re- sources of Agrigento has identified and explored a village- area, a necropolis, and an open-air sanctuary. Seventeen calibrated radiocarbon dates from the sanctuary place the site's Early Bronze Age Castelluccian culture in the late third millennium B.C. Foundations of an oval hut and traces of others excavated to date show that the village lay on a series of terraces created by the filling of irregularities in the hillside. Evi-</page><page sequence="35">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 277 dence that the village was restructured in antiquity is con- firmed by the discovery of a clear, Castelluccian stratigraphy which may be compared with an apparent internal evolu- tion in Castelluccian ceramics (L. Bernabo Brea, Kokalos 22-23 [1976-1977] 49ff.). The village does not seem to have seen prior or successive occupation. An abundance of terra- cotta bobbins and spindle-whorls attests to active textile pro- duction at the time. While many Castelluccian sites have been identified, very few villages have ever been excavated systematically. The village at La Muculufa demonstrates the ability in the Early Bronze Age to modify local topographic conditions accord- ing to the structural needs and provides the architectural background to the noteworthy appearance in Sicily during the Middle Bronze Age of large, perfectly circular buildings, such as the one found nearby in Contrada Gaffe (G. Castel- lana and B. McConnell, AJA 91 [1987] 311). EXCAVATIONS AT TELL RAQAI, A VILLAGE SITE OF EARLY URBAN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA: Glenn M. Schwartz, Johns Hopkins University The Johns Hopkins University/University of Amster- dam Tell Raqai project conducted excavations in fall, 1987 at the mid-third millennium B.C. village site of Tell Raqai in the middle Habur valley of northeast Syria. The project aims to examine the role of the small rural village in the development of urban and state society in northern Mesopo- tamia and the extent of the integration of the village into the new political and economic systems. These investigations mark the first large-scale examination of an early historic period village in Mesopotamia. The excavated sample of the latest third millennium oc- cupation revealed small-scale rectilinear architecture situ- ated around a massive round building, indicative of consid- erable social and economic differentiation at the site. Indus- trial installations distributed among the small structures suggest the existence of specialized production activities ex- tending beyond an agricultural subsistence economy. The excavated ceramics date from a previously unrecog- nized transitional phase between the Ninevite V and Leilan II ("Late Early Dynastic III") periods, probably datable to ca. 2500 B.C. According to the results of a step trench opera- tion, the settlement was founded late in the Ninevite V peri- od and comprised a series of village occupations, the earliest of which are characterized by pis6 architecture. Projected excavation work will continue the exposure of large hori- zontal samples of successive village occupations and the in- vestigation of change in village life during the development of urban and state society in the Habur region. THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD IN THE SOUTHERN ARGOLID: Susan Langdon, University of Missouri at Colum- bia Previous survey and excavation in the Argolid have sketched a general picture of a vibrant and prosperous cen- ter in Mycenaean times and the early Iron Age. Results of the Stanford University Southern Argolid Survey project, now nearing final publication, provide a more richly de- tailed historical view of the area during this important tran- sitional period. Between 1979 and 1983 a total of 319 archaeological sites were identified and studied through systematic and intensive field survey. Drawing from this survey data, this paper sum- marizes the available evidence for the southern Argolid in the Geometric period. A chronological sequence from Proto- geometric through Subgeometric is represented by pottery from 13 discrete spatial assemblages, with trace densities (fewer than five sherds) recorded at another 20 locales. The present results suggest two tentative conclusions. In contrast with local prehistoric settlement patterns and with Geomet- ric activities on the Argive plain, the evidence for habitation in the southern region reveals a slow and intermittent move- ment of population into the area between the tenth and eighth centuries B.C. In fact, only one site may offer a con- tinuous sequence from Protogeometric. Within the inherent limits of survey material, possible reasons for this phenom- enon are addressed. Further analysis of the pottery more closely characterizes local ceramic production and clarifies its larger Argive and southern Greek setting. SESSION VIII-G: GARDENS, VILLAS, AND HOUSES FROM NINEVEH TO PASARGADAE: NOTES ON THE Evo- LUTION AND LEGACY OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST- ERN GARDEN: David Stronach, University of Cali- fornia at Berkeley Notwithstanding the fact that gardens were already seen to be a new source of royal prestige from the late second millennium B.C. onward, recent studies have seldom paid close attention to the changing form of the Near Eastern garden. Yet if we set aside the problems raised by the seem- ingly unique "Hanging Gardens of Babylon," there is more than enough evidence to document something of the charac- ter, and something of the evolution, of certain other, current- ly better understood Near Eastern gardens. It is of particu- lar value to compare, for example, the Neo-Assyrian bas- relief (British Museum 1/24730) which shows the earth- lined water channels and the non-geometric layout of a sev- enth-century B.C. royal garden at Nineveh with the very different elements of Cyrus's mid-sixth century B.C. royal garden at Pasargadae. Not only are major palatial buildings placed within the bounds of the latter garden, but perma- nent water channels and water basins of finely worked stone now line the main pathways and, above all, the plan of the garden can be seen to conform to ordered and geometric lines. Remarkably enough, therefore, this first monumental Achaemenid garden supplies surprisingly direct antecedents for many of the diagnostic features which mark the long- lived and widely diffused Islamic Garden including, it is now possible to maintain, the first example of the chahar bagh, or "four garden" plan.</page><page sequence="36">278 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 THE ORNAMENTAL LANDSCAPING OF THE HELLENISTIC ACROPOLIS OF RHODES: E.E. Rice, Wolfson Col- lege, Oxford University With a solid economic base provided by her trade and mercantile successes, combined with the possibilities offered by a previously uninhabited site, Hellenistic Rhodes devel- oped her acropolis as a marvel of urban decorative landscap- ing. The features of this scheme have often been overlooked in favor of the excavation and restoration of the main archi- tectural features of the acropolis (the temples, stadium, and odeum), but it is still possible to trace on the ground exten- sive interconnecting systems of artificial grottoes and nym- phaea (providing a cool, well-watered venue for displays of statuary and votive offerings), which covered a significant percentage of the acropolis area. Some of these structures were connected to stoas or colonnades which would have formed an additional shady promenade, and given a formal- ization to their ornamental aspects. Thus, although contain- ing the impressive public monuments which must have been among the glories of this rich Hellenistic city, the acropolis was also a focus of private, civic activity, with an emphasis on attractive decoration and personal comfort. A similar landscaping style prevailed in other areas of the city, where "pleasure parks" were designed with shady walks, forests, ravines and streams, plus decorative elements. The care taken with ornamental landscaping reflects the wealth and sophistication of the city, as well as a desire to show itself off to the many foreign visitors who ascended the acropolis to escape the heat and crowds of Rhodes' busy commercial port. THE VIRIDARIUM OF THE PRAEDIA OF JULIA FELIX IN POMPEII: Christopher Charles Parslow, American Academy in Rome The excavations carried out between 1755 and 1757 in and around the viridarium of the Praedia of Julia Felix not only were the first of their kind in Pompeii but revealed one of the finest examples of a richly decorated formal garden in that city. Despite the early date of these excavations, a re- markably accurate record was maintained of the architec- tural elements and works of art encountered on the site, many of which were later removed. These finds were care- fully illustrated on a series of four plans drawn by the chief excavator, Karl Weber. In addition, a letter by Camillo Pa- derni, curator of the Royal Museum, provides an invaluable eyewitness account on the progress of the excavations and the discoveries made in the porticoes enclosing the virida- rium and the large sacrarium dedicated to Isis found at its south end. Although the site had already been reburied at the time of his visit, Winckelmann saw Weber's plans and described the viridarium along with several of its works of art in his fa- mous Sendschreiben. More discoveries were made when the area was reexcavated by Amedeo Maiuri in 1952, including two important statues and soil contours left by plantings. Unfortunately few of these findings were published and the passage of time and later efforts at reconsolidation of struc- tures have obliterated many of the finer details. This paper proposes a reconstruction of the original architectural and artistic appearance of the viridarium of the Praedia of Julia Felix based on analysis of the 18th-century documents, the published and unpublished finds, excavation photographs, and the existing archaeological remains. THE GARDENS AT HADRIAN'S VILLA: Wilhelmina F. Jashemski, University of Maryland, and Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti, Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia Hadrian's Villa is one of the major archaeological sites of the Classical world. It has been studied by Classical ar- chaeologists and architects for five centuries. But the gar- dens, which were such an important aspect of the Villa, have been given little attention. Pirro Ligorio, the 16th-century architect-archaeologist said in his Descrittione that the Villa had 90 piazzas. Many of these would have been gardens, but in the entire history of the Villa only four gardens have been identified, and only two have been published. Our preliminary excavations in 1987 were successful be- yond our greatest expectations and indicate that this site will yield important results for the knowledge of ancient Roman gardens. We began work in the Canopus area and on the west bank we found evidence of elaborate terraced gardens still covered with undisturbed soil. Our spectacular find of a row of pots (half amphoras similar to those found at Pom- peii and at the Villa of Poppaea at Oplontis) gives signifi- cant information about the planting pattern, as well as about the plant material used. Soil samples were taken for soil analyses, pollen analyses, and flotation studies. In the large garden beside the euripus in the Piazza d'Oro we found in the tufa evidence of cuttings which had been filled with soil. We emptied one (almost 2 m2 by 1 m deep), large enough for a sizeable tree. Trial trenches revealed strange configurations cut into the surface of the tufa, which appear to have a special significance. Complete excavation of this garden in 1988, together with further work in the Canopus area, will give a good picture of the planting pattern in two of the most important gardens of the Villa. THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE PROSTAS HOUSE: Barbara Tsakirgis, Vanderbilt University The major literary source for Greek domestic architec- ture is Chapter 7 of Book 6 of Vitruvius's De architectura. At the beginning of his description of Greek houses, Vitru- vius notes that behind the prostas or pastas are located the major rooms (oeci magni) of the house. The terms prostas and pastas have been taken by archaeologists of this century to distinguish two classes of late Classical and early Hellen- istic houses. Wiegand and Schrader, who excavated at Pri- ene, put forth the houses which they discovered as typical prostas houses, with a columned room opening off of one side of the court and an oikos or main room behind. Graham and Robinson called the houses which they had uncovered at Olynthos pastas houses, having a broad corridor on one side, usually on the north of the courtyard. All studies since these have followed the identifications put forth, and little else has been said about the types of Greek houses. One of the few recent studies of Greek houses, by H. Drerup, notes that the prostas type as seen at Priene is Eastern, and perhaps de-</page><page sequence="37">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 279 rived from the megaron, while the pastas house is a Western type. The text of Vitruvius has been much abused in these ear- lier studies. In the first place, Vitruvius makes no distinction between the prostas and the pastas. Secondly, his description indicates that the rooms open on either side of the prostas. In the Prienian houses, a room opens behind, and only some- times on one side of the prostas. I propose that three-room suites, with a central exedra opening off of the court, and with dependent rooms on one or both sides of the exedra are more properly classed as the prostas with dependent oikoi. These three-room suites appear across the Mediterranean, at Vergina, Pella, Monte lato, and Morgantina, and so are a universal, not a solely Eastern, type. Since Vitruvius proba- bly relied on first-hand knowledge of Western houses for his description of Greek houses, it would be appropriate to find the prostas house in the Western Mediterranean. THE LAURENTINE VILLA OF PLINY THE YOUNGER: Eu- genia Salza Prina Ricotti, Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia Scholars have dreamed for centuries of finding the Lau- rentine villa of Pliny the Younger which he described so viv- idly in the letter (2.16) in which he invited his friend Gallo to come and visit him. A villa excavated in Castel Fuscano in 1935-1936 was said for some years to be Pliny's Laurentine villa. This villa, however, bears no resemblance to Pliny's detailed description of his villa, nor to the specific directions that he gives his friend on how to reach the villa coming from Rome. The importance of this villa made it very desir- able to locate it. A careful study of Pliny's description of the villa and the directions for reaching it, together with a care- ful study of the maps of the area, led me to a place called Grotta di Piastra. I carefully surveyed this site and the re- sults were promising. In 1984 I began excavating the site. A successful campaign of trial trenches resulted in the location of the atrium, the D-shaped portico, the seaside tower, the cryptoporticus, and other elements of the villa, exactly as described by Pliny. My subsequent excavations have uncov- ered evidence of the continuity of the Laurentinum into the Severan period and added further information about the villa's history. SESSION VIII-H: GREEK MYTHOLOGY IN ART THESEUS AND THE CREATION OF AN ATHENIAN NA- TIONAL HERO: H.A. Shapiro, Stevens Institute of Technology From his Bronze Age origins as a colorless minotaur- slayer, Theseus rose to the status of national hero of the Athenians in a gradual series of steps from the early sixth to the middle of the fifth century. Because his unique status transcended the vicissitudes of political struggle, even in a period when Athens vacillated among oligarchy, tyranny, and democracy in various forms, Theseus continued steadily to grow in importance. No one faction could claim him, neither could any afford to ignore him. Archaeological evi- dence, combined with textual and iconographical evidence, allows us to delineate the stages of development. Many of the reforms ascribed by Plutarch to Theseus ac- tually took place in the time of Solon, in the early sixth cen- tury: the capture of Eleusis from Megara, the opening of Athens to immigrants from abroad, the founding of the Pan- athenaic festival, the building of a prytaneion and bouleute- rion, and, broadly speaking, the creation of Athens' first democracy. Other of Theseus's reforms reflect developments of the later sixth century, such as the introduction of coinage, illus- trating how, once the image of the founding father was es- tablished, subsequent innovations would naturally attach themselves to him. When Kleisthenes reorganized the demes and tribes in 510, to further the political unification and democratic restructuring of Attika, it was merely a further step in the synoikismos effected by Theseus. In 490 the ghost of Theseus returned to Marathon to encourage the Athe- nian army, and now all that was lacking was some physical token of him. This was accomplished in 475, when Kimon recovered the bones of Theseus from Skiros and brought them back to Athens. The record of Theseus's growth in legend is paralleled by his evolving image in Athenian art of the Archaic period. The earliest extant depiction, on the Frangois Vase, painted shortly before Solon's death, emphasizes the hero's meeting with Ariadne, who will bear him two sons, and the rescued Athenians, whose inscribed names show a keen awareness of Attic genealogies-i.e., Theseus as lover and patriarch, rather than as monster-slayer. Under Peisistratos, Theseus was represented for the first time not as a youth, but as the wise king who united Athens and created her constitution, perhaps an attempt to legitimize the rule of a tyrant who was said to have retained all the laws of Solon. ELEUSINIAN ICONOGRAPHY AND CULT: IAKCHOS AND EUBOULEUS: Kevin Clinton, Cornell University Iakchos, divine guide of the Eleusinian initiates, has been identified by modern scholars with various figures in Eleu- sinian scenes: a torch-bearing youth, a boy on a horn of plenty, and (by F. Graf) Dionysus. At the 1986 Annual Meeting (AJA 91 [1987] 288) I showed that Eubouleus was represented as a young man with long locks, a knee-length garment, and a torch. A re- maining problem is that in some paintings two such figures appear. Combining the descriptions of Iakchos in Aristophanes' Frogs and Pausanias with other literary and epigraphical evidence, we can expect him, ideally, to have a myrtle crown and a torch and to appear in the company of initiates. This allows us to identify him with the youthful god in the Nin- nion Tablet. It is significant that all the initiates in the Tablet wear a himation, their distinctive festive garment. Iakchos, as God of the Initiates, also has one. This is the clue to his identifi- cation elsewhere. On the Pourtales krater and the Lenin- grad relief hydria only one member of each pair of young torch-bearing gods wears this garment. The himation, therefore, is the final attribute that identifies Iakchos. This then helps us to identify other Eleusinian figures, such as Eumolpus. It also leads to an easy interpretation of</page><page sequence="38">280 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 the Ninnion Tablet, as an illustration of the first day (lower plane) and the last day (upper plane) of the Mysteries at Eleusis. These conclusions in turn permit more precise in- ferences about the roles of Eubouleus and Iakchos in the cult and more precise speculation about the identity of the divine child born in the sacred rite. SILENS IN PERFORMANCES AND ON VASES: Guy Michael Hedreen, Franklin and Marshall College What ancient beliefs and customs underlie the many pic- tures of silens on Attic vases? In what sphere of activity were beliefs about silens promulgated? One ancient practice which is illustrated in at least some scenes of silens on vases is that of dressing up in silen costumes, as in satyr-play. Identifying such pictures presents several difficulties, but two points of particular interest can be established beyond reasonable doubt: 1) Vase-painters illustrated some perfor- mances of men dressed as silens without including details of costuming. Those scenes which illustrate the costume of the silen chorus-man are exceptional, and may have been painted for special purposes: it appears that the vase-paint- ers did not regularly differentiate men dressed as silens from "real" silens in their pictures. 2) The earliest illustrations of silens in performances date to the first half of the sixth cen- tury, not to the last quarter of the century as sometimes thought, and are often characterized by obscenity. These observations suggest several possibilities: The physical form of the silen, if not the idea, may have origi- nated in masquerades. Early sixth-century performances of men dressed as silens may have been more akin in tone to Old Comedy than were satyr-plays of the Classical period. The substantial increase in the number of scenes of silens on Attic vases dating ca. 540-510 B.C. possibly reflects a prom- inent role of silen-performances in Athenian festivals of Dionysos at this time. Many vase-paintings of silens which do not include visible theatrical characteristics may never- theless reflect performances, either directly, as illustrations of the content of the plays, or indirectly, as illustrations of etiological myths explaining the origins of performance or its association with Dionysiac festivals. AFTERMATH: ARCHAIC CORINTHIAN POTTERY (CON- TINUED): Darrell A. Amyx, University of California at Berkeley In Corinth VII:2A, there is presented a group of previ- ously unpublished vases and fragments not reserved for pub- lication elsewhere, carried down through the excavation year 1968. The current project is basically a continuation of that work, presenting in catalogue form materials found after 1968, with the inclusion of some other items previously over- looked. Altogether, the list deals with around 200 pieces, of which the following must serve as a small sampling. Pieces attributable to individual painters and narrow sty- listic groupings: 1) pyxis C-40-224 by the Sphinx Painter; 2) olpe (?) fragment C-40-290 by the Clermont-Ferrand Painter; 3) kotyle CP-2598, Samos Group, unfigured; 4) ko- tyle fragments C-36-2443 and C-36-2444 by the Patras Painter; 5) lekanoid bowl C-47-718 with the black-poly- chrome decoration, Chimaera Group, unfigured; 6) broad- bottomed oinochoe CP-2487+ by the Painter of Athens 93. Fragments giving tantalizing glimpses of scenes from he- roic legend: 7) kylix fragment C-50-169 with a representa- tion of a centauromachy (Herakles and Pholos?); 8) plate, on its inner face a splendid rendering of Herakles and Hydra; 9) small bit of a krater C-1978-101, on which has survived the leg of a running figure with winged boot (Perseus?). Also of note, for non-heroic subject matter: 10) krater fragment C-1977-82 showing racing horses, one of which bears a brand (?); 11) a red-ground krater C-26-12 with padded dancers and naked women, recalling works in the Andromeda Group, but different in style; 12) oinochoe frag- ment C-26-13 with a curious harvesting scene. WHAT WAS THE DISCUS-THROWER OF NAUKYDES HOLDING? John H. Kroll, University of Texas at Austin The diskobolos conventionally ascribed to Naukydes (D. Arnold, Die Polykletnachfolge [1969] 110-15, pl. 12) intent- ly examines a small object, now missing, that he held be- tween the thumb and first finger of his right hand. It is here proposed that the object was the all-important lot (xijpov) that the pentathlete has just drawn to determine either his turn in the competition or, in keeping with the latest theory of scoring the pentathlon (W. Sweet, ZPE 50 [1983] 287-90), to select an event for a semi-final rematch. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE LITERARY CONCEPT AND VISUAL DEPICTION OF THE AIGIS: John R. Mar- szal, Bryn Mawr College The aigis presents a unique opportunity for viewing the relation between the literary and visual arts. It is simply an object, albeit one difficult to explain, rather than a story, for which the many possible variants in the oral/written tradi- tion render most complex the relation with the illustrations. Literary descriptions of the aigis can be divided into two periods, pre- and post-representational. It is clear from the references in Homer that it was then already perceived as a material object, but its exact nature is unclear because the descriptions are contradictory. The aigis does not appear in the visual arts until ca. 570, and when it does, it simply covers Athena's back, at times without any means of attachment. The ambiguity of the early descriptions may account for the rather late and uncertain appearance. But once depicted, it is forced to conform to the logical rules of Greek art; it takes a number of forms, all as a garment of Athena, and its form is always understandable. Later literary descriptions respond to the new awareness of the item. They have none of the ambiguity found in Homer and they always describe the aigis in terms of a gar- ment worn by Athena. The recognition of the changing concept offers two imme- diate points for consideration. First, it supports the anti- quity of the scenes of Athena's arming (in which the aigis is described), especially II. 5.733-47, which have recently been ascribed to the Peisistratid recension (M. Halm-Tisserant, RA 1986, 245-78). Second, it raises question with the cur- rent view of the etymology of the word, i.e., as a goatskin</page><page sequence="39">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 281 (e.g., Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire Jtymologique de la langue grecque 1 [1968] 30), which cannot be found in Homer and which can be traced in the visual arts only from ca. 500. THE WALTERS MUSES: NEW LIGHT ON MUSE TYPES OF THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD: Carol A. Benson, Walters Art Gallery Three under-life-size marble statues of muses in the Walters Art Gallery, currently featured in the Walters's special exhibition, "From Alexander to Cleopatra: Greek Art of the Hellenistic Age," contribute new evidence to the ongoing discussion of Muses in the Hellenistic period. The statuette of a seated Muse (23.84) is one of only two examples of the so-called Ourania Type to retain the head; the statuette of a standing Muse of the bookroll, or Klio Type (23.100), in its simple structure and uncomplicated drapery forms, may represent a very early version of this well-known type. Close comparisons of these two works with terracotta figurines and molds of the fourth and third centuries and with the reliefs identified by Carter as part of the late third-century Altar of Athena at Priene (J.C. Cart- er, "The Date of the Altar of Athena at Priene and Its Re- liefs," StMat 6 [1984] 748-64) suggest the integral nature of the connections of these two Muse types with the very begin- ning of the Hellenistic period. The statuette of a leaning Muse (23.90), on the other hand, is a hitherto-unknown variant of a Muse type shown leaning on a rocky support. This fine-quality, undoubtedly Hellenistic original, whose head and neck are turned and in- clined in such a way as to suggest that she is gazing into a pool or at another figure, offers a tantalizing glimpse of a sanctuary or garden composition involving interaction be- tween the Muses and/or their surroundings. THE TEXTUAL SOURCES OF THE ODYSSEY LAND- SCAPES: Steven Lowenstam, University of Oregon The first-century B.C. Roman frescoes called the Odys- sey landscapes reveal an interesting relation to ancient texts. We are fortunate that the landscape painter has not only identified many of the people portrayed but also labeled some of the inanimate objects. These 25 labels (epigramma- ta), which have not received the attention they deserve, can be directly compared with the Homeric text. The non-hu- man identifications such as Kp 7'v? ("spring"), aKraL' ("crags"), and voual ("pastures") are of vital importance be- cause comparison with the Odyssey allows us to see that the landscape painter has attempted to be faithful to its very text, even to the degree of using such poetic words as aKT-a and KP7iv7 (Od. 10.89, 107). The names of the figures portrayed are of equal interest. In "Land of the Laestrygonians," the painter provides names for the three scouts sent out by Odysseus, even though Homer left them anonymous ("[I] chose two men with a herald as the third," Od. 102). The painter labels the herald Eurybates, the usual name for a herald in the Homeric poems, and identifies the other two men as Antilochos and Anchialos, names which are never identified as Odysseus's men in our version of the Odyssey. These names or approxi- mations of them, however, are found in a list of Odysseus's companions in the Chiliades, the late epic poem written by Tzetzes, in a passage which specifically cites the Odyssey as its source. The Landscapes, therefore, provide our earliest evidence of some variant epic material which is not attested again until the 12th century A.C. Our conclusion, then, is that the painter of the Landscapes relied on the very text of the Odyssey but departed from it to follow variant epic texts, some of which seem to have belonged to the edition of the Odyssey available to him. SESSION VIII-P: SEALS AND SEAL IMPRES- SIONS IN ADMINISTRATIVE SETTINGS: IMPLICATIONS FOR PERSONAL AND PO- LITICAL RELATIONSHIPS SEALINGS AND ADMINISTRATION IN THE EARLY DY- NASTIC I INANNA TEMPLE AT NIPPUR: Richard L. Zettler, University of Pennsylvania Over the last few years a number of studies have ap- peared that have focused on the backs of sealings, the pur- pose being to identify the various objects sealed. Those studies have not only contributed to our knowledge of what objects were sealed, but have emphasized at least implicitly the character of sealings as artifacts reflecting administra- tive procedures. To test the potential of sealings for reconstructing admin- istrative organizations, the author analyzed 150 sealings from the Ur III (2112-2004 B.C.) Inanna temple at Nip- pur, correlating seals and objects sealed. The seals on the sealings were inscribed and, so, their owners known. Their respective roles in the administration of the institution could be outlined from the temple's archive. The author then com- pared the study's results with information on the adminis- trative organization of the temple drawn from its archive alone. He concluded that sealings can be used to outline ad- ministrative organization and can, moreover, expand on in- formation drawn from texts. In addition, the study set out a general methodology and parameters for analyzing sealings. The author's study was published in Journal of Cuneiform Studies. The present paper puts forward preliminary results of study of 50 sealings from Early Dynastic I (ca. 2900-2600 B.C.) levels of the Inanna temple as a step toward recon- structing a diachronic picture of administrative organization of that institution. The sealings were published earlier by Donald P. Hansen. The paper concludes that Early Dynas- tic I sealing practices vary from those of the end of the third millennium B.C., for example, by the use of "counter seal- ing" (a common practice not only in the Inanna temple, but in other groups of Early Dynastic sealings, for example, sealings from the Ur Seal Impression Strata). The paper offers alternative explanations for the variations noted. ASSYRIAN COLONY SEAL IMPRESSIONS: ICONOGRAPHY AND STYLE IN CONTEXT: Nancy W. Leinwand, Bryn Mawr College</page><page sequence="40">282 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 93 The study of the seals and impressions of the Old Assy- rian colonies in Anatolia has concentrated on the analysis of seal styles and their affinities. The iconographical content of the glyptic has also been described and categorized. New analysis of the seal impressions in light of their associated texts yields a clearer understanding of both the stylistic and iconographical classification. In the colony period, the standard form of sealed object is an inscribed tablet, enclosed in a clay envelope with the text repeated, and the seals of the witnesses and sometimes the parties to the document impressed on it. The names of the sealing individuals often appear at the start of the envelope text. The majority of the known texts were written and sealed in Kanesh. A number of documents were written and sealed abroad, at Assur and various colonial centers in North Syria and Anatolia, and sent to Kanesh. The aim of my research is to trace the distribution of re- gional styles and iconography by means of data gained from the associated texts. I determine, on a text by text basis, the origin of the text, the ethnic affiliation and city of origin of the participants in the document, and then examine the seal iconography and style in terms of these facts. Some patterns of seal use can be traced. The figure of the bull altar or bull god of native and Old Assyrian glyptic provides an opportu- nity to examine the interaction, in seal style and iconogra- phy, between the mother city Assur, and the main colonial center, Kanesh. The same iconographical elements are used differently in the two centers. The differences are further modulated by seal style. We can compare the seals in use in Assur among Assyrian traders, their family members, busi- ness associates, and legal witnesses, those used by Assyrians who dwell in Kanesh and their associates, and the seals of Anatolian individuals who conduct business with the Assy- rian traders. The comparison suggests differences in the meaning of the bull god depending upon the seal user's orientation. SOME CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ICONOGRAPHY, GLYP- TIC "FAMILIES," AND THE MINOAN ADMINISTRATIVE ELITE IN NEOPALATIAL CRETE: Judith Weingarten, Le Caylar, France Each major center of sealing administration has what may be called an administrative elite, i.e., seal-owners who stamped substantially more nodules than the mass of seal- owners: such an elite, usually no more than 12-13% of the total seal-owners, account for a grossly disproportionate number of nodules at their site. We review MM IIIB Knos- sos, Temple Repository (4 elite members who stamped 61.4% of sealings), LM IB Ayia Triada (17 elite; 79.9%), LM IB Khania, Odos Katre (8 elite; 84.7%), and LM IB Zakro (14 elite; 51.0%). Our working premise is that there was a relationship be- tween this administrative elite and iconography at each site: some of the elite seals were made intentionally similar, to be used by members of "families," i.e., closed structured groups in a fixed relationship. "Family" affinities may be expressed by 1) shared use of related visual themes (= family icono- graphy) or 2) stylistic similarities which show that the seals share certain artistic conventions, perhaps developing a de- liberate family likeness. There are hints at Knossos/Temple Repository of such glyptic relationships but it is only in the larger LM IB deposits that detailed studies were possible. At Ayia Triada we have been able to isolate a number of glyptic "families" among the administrative elite. Analysis at Zakro is complicated by the habit of multiple stamping of nodules, but it is possible that all seals made by the local Zakro Master were used by members of an extended glyptic "family," a family recognized by stylistic similarities. We examine the "families" and their iconography and conclude that they may represent local power bases. ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF 15TH-14TH CENTURY B.C. SEAL IMPRESSIONS FROM NUZI: Diana L. Stein, Archdiologisches Institut at Hamburg The study of ancient glyptic has shifted its focus in recent years from art-historical to sociological problems, but many of the underlying assumptions remain unchanged and un- tested. Central to both lines of investigation is the conviction that there is a meaningful pattern to the distribution, design, and use of seals. Consequently, designs in similar style are considered to be contemporary products of a single work- shop or even hand, while stylistic or iconographic differ- ences denote a discrepancy in date, origin, or function. These premises needed to be tested on a larger scale with a manageable, coherent corpus of material, such as the public and private archives of cuneiform tablets bearing seal im- pressions from Nuzi in northeastern Iraq. Focusing on the private archive of Prince Silwa-tessub, which spans five generations between ca. 1380 and 1325 B.C., the seal analysis was conducted in two stages, of which the first comprised two parallel lines of inquiry: textual and art-historical. These two lines of inquiry were pursued sep- arately so that neither would influence the outcome of the other. In this way, the social, temporal, and regional groups of seals derived from their textual context provided an inde- pendent check on the empirical patterns of design. The com- bined results form the second stage of analysis, which ad- dresses the following questions: Are there identifiable rela- tionships between seal designs, time, rank, profession and text type? How reliable are these relationships? What dis- tinguishes an "institutional" from a "private" seal? Who de- termined the designs (the cutter, the client, the office)? Are there recognizable craftsmen or workshops? To the extent that this is a private archive at a provincial site, complementary studies will be necessary to clarify the role of seals and sealings in the great organizations of palace and temple in Mesopotamia. THE SOCIAL VALUE OF SEALINGS AT HASANLU IVB, IRAN: Michelle Marcus, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University In the past, seals and sealings have primarily held an ar- tistic interest for the designs incised on their surfaces. While this visual information is important, recent scholarship has begun to recognize the further value of seals and especially sealings as important documents of economic and social is- sues. The present paper aims to substantiate the validity of this new approach by examining a group of commodity seal-</page><page sequence="41">1989] THE 90TH GENERAL MEETING 283 ings from the Iron II period settlement of Hasanlu IVB in Northwest Iran, impressed with seals of so-called local style. Because of the controlled stratigraphic context of the Ha- sanlu finds, precious information is available as to what floor levels in which buildings the sealings were found and with what objects they were associated. The paper discusses the type and function of the sealings based on markings on the backs; their overall distribution at the site; and the stylistic information contained in the seal designs impressed on the fronts. Conclusions are generated about sealing practices at the site; the possible function of building areas in which sealings were found; and the possi- ble status of the seal owners. In particular, it is possible to reconstruct sealed treasuries in certain building areas on the Citadel Mound, in which were stored precious goods in sealed containers. These "stores" can even be associated ten- tatively with one or two important individuals or offices at Hasanlu on the basis of glyptic style-particularly the in- corporation of themes best known from contemporary Assy- rian royal iconography. ROYAL SEALS IN SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C. SYRIA: FUNCTION, STYLE AND ICONOGRAPHY: Bonnie S. Magness-Gardiner, Bryn Mawr College For the purposes of this paper, a royal seal will be defined as one belonging to an individual holding the title of king. As determined by an examination of seal use on texts within the royal archives of Mari, Alalah, and Ugarit, royal seals con- stitute a special functional class within the Syrian Bronze Age corpus of seals. At Mari the royal seal was used primar- ily in the conduct of foreign relations and in controlling access to certain specific commodities, notably silver and wine. At Alalah, the use of the seals of the kings of Yamhad on land purchases and loans reveals an interest on the part of Yamhad in preserving its position as the major landowner within its vassal's territory. At Ugarit, the royal dynastic seal is given a special term and its use reserved for validating certain internal allocations of land and international trea- ties. Thus the use of royal seals clearly relates to the pre- rogatives and duties of the king. The purpose of this paper is to examine if and how the iconography and style of royal seals relate to their special function in different Syrian states in the successive periods of the Bronze Age. Detailed analysis of the style and icono- graphy of the royal seals from Mari, Alalah and Ugarit in- dicates a substantial amount of "borrowing" from Mesopo- tamian prototypes both in overall design and in individual elements. It is only during the Mari period, however, that the "borrowed" elements on the Mari royal seals are con- temporary with their prototypes in Mesopotamia proper. This is particularly evident in the Ugarit dynastic seals (Old Babylonian period original and Late Bronze Age copy) where the iconography and style refer consciously to the ear- lier Ur III symbolism of the "king and the cup." It is sug- gested that symbolism of kingship developed in Mesopota- mia was adopted as a means of expressing legitimate power through reference to a glorious, if distant, past as well as to divine sanction of the ruling dynasty.
