<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die geheime Schutzgottheit von Rom. By ANGELO BRELICH. Translated from the Italian by V. VON GON- ZENBACH. ("Albae Vigiliae," Neue Folge, Heft VI.) Zurich: Rhein-Verlag, 1949. Pp. 66. S. Fr. 8. This study in Roman religion is a continuation of a series of which several volumes have been reviewed earlier in THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY. The series is under the general editorship of Karl Kerenyi (in collaboration with S. Eitrem and C. de Tolnay). Kerenyi himself, who writes the Preface to this book, is primarily con- cerned in his study of Roman religion with probing the hidden meaning of religious myths and rituals, and in building a kind of reconstruction of the thinking that lies behind them. Professor Brelich uses a similar ap- proach to the problem of the secret, protecting divinity of Rome, an entity as it were reniotitm a n otitia vzil- gari.1 This investigation does not undertake to find the name for such a divinity (Diva Angerona was popularly supposed to be the deity meant), but rather to study the factors which would contribute to the concept of this divine power, to explore the nature of "das gemeinsame Element" appropriate to the role of a "geheime Schutz- gottheit." The analysis of the tutelary divinity of Rome stems from the tradition, handed down by various authors, of the unknown secret name of the city itself. With this tradition went the idea that the name of the protecting god must not be revealed, in order that it might not become subj ect to the power of an enemy. The basic question raised is contained in Plutarch Roman Ques- tions 61: "Why may not that deity, whether male or female, in whose especial protection Rome lies, be men- tioned, inquired after, or named ... ?" (tr. H. J. Rose). From this concept of a divinity with undefined sex we reach the idea, Brelich argues, that either this divinity is older than an anthropomorphic mythology and does not yet have a defined sex, or that the god is an ab- straction and no longer has any sex, or that it is an androgynous divinity. The nature of an androgynous divine power Brelich examines carefully, for example, in the relationship to be found in Genius-Fortuna, in a consideration of Pales, listed as both male and female, and in a study of Juno in Lanuvium, and of Diana in Aricia. In the places just mentioned, Juno and Diana are protecting divinities of their states or areas, and are always somehow linked with a male divine power. Thus, Brelich believes, the secret protecting divinity of the state must contain within itself both sexual elements of existence. In addition to this, vari- ous heterogeneous factors belong to the very dim pic- ture we can obtain of the "geheime Schutzgottheit" of Rome. In this sense Genius, Fortuna, Pales, Ops Con- siva, and Diva Angerona are all "Schutzgottheiten der Stadt," because they all individually share in this com- plex of ideas underlying that divine power, a complex which contains a basic pattern of life and death, of fertility and continuity of existence, but which is ex- pressed in various ways in more than one divinity. The arguments, however, of this stimulating contribution to our knowledge of Roman religion must be weighed carefully in the light of the evidence presented. ELIZABETH C.
