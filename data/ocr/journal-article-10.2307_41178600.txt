<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIGHTING IN THE SHADE: What the Ancient Greeks Knew About Humor Philip H. Young Tt has long been held that the capacity for laughter (risus capax) is a peculiarly human characteristic. The witty Lucian of Samosata (2nd century A.D.) noted that the way to distin- guish a man from an ass is that one laughs and the other does not.1 In all societies humor is important not only in individual communication but also as a molding force of social groups, reinforcing their norms and regulating behavior. "Each partic- ular time, each era, in fact each moment, has its own condition and themes for laughter . . . because of the major preoccupa- tions, concerns, interests, activities, relations, and mode pre- vailing at the time."2 The ultimate goal of anyone who studies another culture, such as ancient Greece, is to understand the people themselves who were more than the sum total of monu- ments, historical incidents, or social groupings. One way to ap- proach this goal directly is to study the culture's humor. As Goethe aptly observed: "Men show their characters in nothing more clearly than in what they think laughable." Humor has been the subject of philosophical speculation from antiquity to the present. Early modern theories include those of Freud, who explained humor in terms of a release of psychic energy required to repress sexual and aggressive Philip H.

Young desires, and Bergson, who explained humor as a reflection of society's inflexibility in forcing people into mechanical roles which negate natural spontaneity.9 Beginning in the 1970s, hu- mor has become the subject of scientific investigation, but de- spite many important breakthroughs, no comprehensive explanation of humor has been developed. As noted by the leading researchers in the field: "If the complexity of humor phenomena were ever in doubt, that doubt should now be dis- pelled. We have only scratched the empirical surface of this most interesting phenomenon whose nature has been pondered over the centuries."4 Fortunately, research now permits us to make several useful observations about the nature of humor. Most humor involves elements of three major themes: incongruity, insult, and inde- cency. Incongruity is the gap between what a person expects and what is actually apparent, and this dissonance requires mental activity to resolve the incongruity. As one researcher put it: "Humor ... is based on a conceptual shift, a jolt to our picture of the ways things are supposed to be."5 It provides an acceptable arena for regression from logical and realistic cogni- tive functioning into more primitive patterns. Momentarily, "the rules of logic, time, place, reality, and proper conduct are suspended."6 The mental tension caused by humorous incon- gruity is relieved in a comic catharsis when a person "gets the joke." A second element commonly found in humor is insult or dis- paragement with a resultant feeling of superiority. "People en- joy jokes in which individuals or groups they like or identify with put down those they dislike."7 Insult humor often in- volves the deflating of a hero or an ideal. Of course, this device is usually couched in sophisticated wrappings, such as satire, mimicry, caricature, or parody. A third major theme frequently found in humor is indecency, that is, overt reference to culturally proscribed topics, typically sexual behavior and relevant body parts, excretory functions, and socially unacceptable behavior of various types. The great extent of social prohibitions against addressing these most common of human functions makes devices involving inde- cency especially filled with repressed psychic energy waiting to escape through humor. Often, the humor results from careful</page><page sequence="3">Ancient Greek Humor 291 manipulation of the indecent subject, using implication and in- nuendo to achieve intellectual recognition of the forbidden topic. In addition to incongruity, insult, and indecency, many other factors have been shown to influence humor, such as the sud- denness of the incongruity, the presence of a positive psycho- logical state, the nature of a person's immediate environment, the amount of personal identification with the humorous topic, personal inflexibility, etc. These aspects of humor are distin- guished by researchers, but they are not really mutually exclu- sive. A humorous experience normally blends several aspects of humor and, indeed, is usually richer for doing so. An important corollary to the elements of humor so far men- tioned is that of cultural, social, and personal specificity. To perceive incongruity, to cast an insult, or to notice indecency one must have a strong sense of self, of social norms, and of cultural standards. "Adults from different cultures often fail to appreciate each other's humor, because they don't have the same picture of the world and so do not find the same things incongruous."8 Similarly, at different time periods in the same culture, humor may vary greatly, and different outlooks and ex- perience bases between contemporary individuals may cause different types of humor. Humor reveals a group's allegiances and attitudes, as well as its hierarchical relationship to other groups.9 As one researcher has noted: "... without a social referent, humor would make no sense."10 We do not yet have a comprehensive theory of humor, but "fortunately, we do not need to have at our command a thor- ough understanding of a phenomenon in order to make use of it."11 Because of its cultural specificity, humor is a useful tool for investigating another culture, such as that of ancient Greece. While it is remarkable that after 2,500 years we can identify any aspect of Greek humor, the examples from litera- ture, art, and artifacts which follow reveal a sense of humor not altogether unlike our own. Despite the careless statement of one anthropologist that "archaeology has no direct relevance to the study of humor,"12 we will see that the remains of an ancient culture can, indeed, inform us about what its people found funny.</page><page sequence="4">292 SOUNDINGS Philip H. Young Humor in Greek Literature The best known examples of ancient Greek humor come from formal comedy, which the Greeks invented. Tragedy was formalized first, probably in the middle of the sixth century, and comedy as a distinct entity emerged in the early fifth cen- tury with its first inclusion at the festival of the City Dionysia at Athens in 486 B.C. Athenian comedy (meaning literally "sing- ing in a komos" or happy, drunken procession) was probably born out of the festive dancing and satyr plays associated with the Dionysos festival. In the latter, actors wore costumes with heavy padding in the stomach, phallic, and buttock areas to represent the half-human satyrs thought to be associated with Dionysiac revel. These merry dancers, called "komasts" in At- tica, are frequently represented on sixth century pottery slap- ping and kicking their buttocks and dancing with women. Vase paintings of men dressed up as animals, such as horses and birds, suggest that animal mummery may have predated com- edy.13 With the maturing of Attic comedy as counterpart to tragedy, the Greek sense of humor was institutionalized. Greek comedy is largely known through the plays of Aris- tophanes, whose puns, ridiculous figures, earthy characters and general satire retain much of their original humor today. The sophistication of his humor has been studied by many scholars, and a few references here will demonstrate his usage of a vari- ety of humorous devices. Aristophanic comedy abounds with the humor of incongruity. There is parody of divinities, ora- cles, contemporary technical writings, and literature, politicians and generals. Women take over the Acropolis and boycott their husbands sexually (Lysistrata); birds build a city and hu- miliate the gods (Birds); Dionysos goes to Hades and judges a poetic contest between Aeschylus and Euripedes (Frogs); wo- men take over a city's government and abolish private property (Ekklesiazusae). Aristophanes juxtaposes grandiloquent lan- guage with vulgarity and makes frequent "asides" to the audi- ence which are, indeed, incongruous breaks of the illusion of drama. These comedies include every known form of word- play, such as adding syllables to words, using incorrect gram- mar, creating composite names (e.g. Philokleon, or "Kleon- lover" in the Wasps), and using puns, double-entendres, altered quotes, and perverted literary meters.</page><page sequence="5">Ancient Greek Humor 293 Probably the best-known example of Aristophanes' use of in- sult humor is the portrayal of Socrates in the Clouds, a charac- terization so funny and yet so accurate that it is reported that when the play was originally presented (423 B.C.)Â» Socrates himself, one of the spectators, stood up and bowed to the audi- ence. A good example of Aristophanes' satire of the philoso- pher's teachings is the scene where his students bend over to investigate Tartaros and find that this positions their rumps to- ward the sky to learn astronomy (line 193). Note that the com- bination of insult and indecency heightens the comic effect. The necessity of intellectual understanding of an insult or iden- tification with a joke in order to make humor work is illustrated by another passage in the Clouds where the student Khairephon is called "a living corpse" (lines 503-4). Unfortunately, this in- sult is not funny for us because we know very little about its target, although if we picture an overly skinny fellow with sal- low complexion, we can catch a hint of the intended humor. In general, Greek comedy with its insult humor can be described as having a democratic spirit because of its lack of respect for anyone in authority.14 Indecency is the common denominator of all Aristophanes' plays, and the tone of his sexual and excretory humor provides a good barometer for what was considered acceptable in Greek society. A word-play used not only by Aristophanes but also by other comedians involved the Greek word choiras which usually meant "pig" but also was a slang term for the female genitals. In the Acharnians (lines 730-835) this dual meaning is played for all it is worth in a scene about a man who is trying to disguise his two daughters as pigs and makes comments about sacrific- ing them to the love-goddess Aphrodite, noting that when they grow up they will be fatter and hairier like their mother. Aris- tophanes' comedies are filled with explicit terms for intimate body parts and functions which are often toned down or omit- ted in modern translations and in productions operating out of a different cultural sensibility. Humor can be found in other Greek writers besides the for- mal comedians. When Aristophanes parodies deities and reli- gious practices, he has an excellent mentor in Homer. In a passage in the Iliad (Book I), the lame god Hephaistos clumsily serves drinks to the other Olympian gods, much to their</page><page sequence="6">294 SOUNDINGS Philip H. Young amusement. In the Odyssey (Book VIII) the cunning craftsman forges special chains to trap his unfaithful wife Aphrodite and her lover Ares in bed together. The other gods marvel with laughter at his clever stratagem and the just punishment of the adulterers. This funny story, in fact, serves to reinforce Greek rules of morality. Homer's general presentation of the Olympi- ans as anthropomorphic entities with very human shortcomings was both a source of amusement and consternation for the lat- ter Greeks and Romans. The gods' sexual exploits and in- trigues, such as Hera's seduction of Zeus to remove him from the conflict at Troy (Book XIV), were particularly interesting to the ancients. Another well-known comic scene in the Iliad (Book II) is quite revealing about social values in Homer's time. The commoner Thersites, described by Homer as "the ugliest man that had come to Ilium," challenges Agamemnon on his unfair disposition of spoils, and is promptly cudgeled by Odysseus for his efforts. The result is laughter all around, not sympathy, because this buffoon of low birth has transgressed his social position. The insult is as effective a weapon as the stick in reinforcing the group's norms.15 In the fifth century, the lyric poet Pindar occasionally incor- porated gaffs at the athletic champions for whom he wrote vic- tory odes, including a jibe at the proud city fathers of a champion who hailed from a small, little-known city. Pindar even jokes about his own slowness in getting this work written, saying that the champion had to wait like a man for an heir and nearly died before the ode was complete. Herodotus marvels with tongue in cheek at foreign customs, and he frequently utilizes puns. His history, written for public entertainment, contains many humorous stories, including one concerning Kleisthenes, the tyrant of Sikyon. When the time comes for Kleisthenes' daughter to marry, he invites suitors from all over Greece, and after a year's testing he has almost decided to choose the Athenian Hippokleides. However, at the final feast, Hippokleides dances on the tables, even turning over and spin- ning on his head, with the result that Kleisthenes informs him that he has danced away his marriage. The comic retort, "Hip- pokleides doesn't care," was a common saying for the Greeks.16</page><page sequence="7">Ancient Greek Humor 295 Even the great tragedians employ humor for their purposes. Aeschylus has Clytemnestra use a crude, nautical double-en- tendre to describe Cassandra. Euripedes uses a comic begin- ning to his tragic masterpiece, the Baechae, showing two famous old men, Teireisias and Kadmos, dressed up in youthful bacchic costumes. Later in the play, in a scene with terrible tragic overtones, Pentheus, who has formerly scoffed at Diony- sos, now feels the god's power and dresses as a maenad, a satyr's female counterpart. The audience sees the humorous incongruity but also knows that Pentheus will end up beheaded by his own mother in the Dionysiac frenzy that will follow. The Greek Anthology, a heterogeneous compilation of epigrams, in- cludes many humorous excerpts, especially in its section on sa- tirical and convivial poems.17 Humor in Vase Paintings and Their Inscriptions Vase paintings provide yet another large body of evidence for the study of the Greek sense of humor. Description and analysis of these remarkably detailed representations of every- day life, myth, and imagination has been a major source of in- formation about all aspects of ancient Greek culture. Because vase painters were for the most part uneducated and not mem- bers of elite society, many of their themes reflect everyday life and include elements of the common man's humor. Of course, with no written descriptions of the meaning of vase paintings (except occasional painted labels), understanding their content becomes a matter of interpretation. An early example of a humorous Greek vase painting is the Hubbard Amphora, deriving from the Cypriote Geometric pe- riod. The unusual scene appears to be a parody of Egyptian art motifs, including an enthroned, drinking lady in Cretan garb and a caricature of a winged sphinx sniffing a flower. Another early vessel which has humorous details is the famous Francois Vase, whose plethora of painted scenes of mythological and lit- erary content has attracted much scholarly attention. Among the popular stories illustrated on the vase is the return of He- phaistos to Olympos. The baby Hephaistos, after being flung out of Olympos by his mother Hera, who was angry at his de- formity, is rescued and grows up to be a master craftsman. He constructs a beautiful golden throne for his mother, but when</page><page sequence="8">296 SOUNDINGS Philip H. Young she sits in it, she discovers that it will not release her. The other gods fail in their efforts to bring Hephaistos back to Olympos to extricate her, but finally Dionysos loosens his stub- born resolve by getting him drunk. The vase painter has cap- tured the humor of this story of divine squabbling, showing Hera stuck in her chair while the drunken, Dionysiac proces- sion approaches. Hephaistos' lameness is especially mocked by this artist and by others who painted the same scene with vari- ous degrees of deformity illustrated. Identification with rowdy drunkenness, derision at a physically deformed person, comic revenge, and the inherent incongruity of anthropomorphic gods account for the humor of this scene. Another popular story depicted on the Francois Vase and in other art of die mid- sixth century is the battle of the pygmies and cranes mentioned by Homer. Again, insult based on physical deformity is the principal theme, but there is also more subtle comedy in the incongruous parallel of this "battle" with serious heroic con- flicts such as the battles of Lapiths and centaurs, Greeks and Amazons, or gods and giants that were common themes in both monumental and popular Greek art.18 Many vase painters embellished their artistic endeavors with inscriptions which have provided a unique source for study of the artists and their interests. As might be expected, among the many types are some inscriptions which contain aspects of humor. On a black-figured pelike a greedy oil merchant says: "Zeus, would that I might get rich." Vase painters sometimes toasted each other, but in one case the artist Euthymides wrote about a colleague: "Euphronius never did anything like this." It has been argued that this is a "bespoke" vase, i.e. one painted for a particular client, and this suggests an insult joke shared by artist and patron instead of a general boast. A con- temporary of these two artists was named Smikros ("Shorty"), and in a surely tongue-in-cheek scene he labels a large, husky fellow with his own name. A jokester in the eighth century la- beled a humble skyphos "Nestor's Cup," a reference to the golden goblet of the venerable king of Pylos described in the Odyssey (Book III). Occasionally, a vase painter adds an inscrip- tion which makes the vessel itself incongruously comment to its user; one cup reads "Greetings and good drinking." Another "I am a pretty cup."19</page><page sequence="9">Ancient Greek Humor 297 Inscriptions on Greek pottery are important for providing an immediate, written connection to the writer which is to a large extent unfiltered through the screens of literary convention or other mechanisms of formal control. There is probably an ele- ment of implicit insult humor aimed at foreigners in adding what amounts to graffiti to vase paintings known to be destined for the Etruscan market. The Greeks, though politically di- vided into proudly independent poleis, were just as proud of their common cultural heritage. This sharp distinction be- tween Greek and foreigner is nowhere better illustrated than by the term "barbarian" - literally, one who says "bar, bar" or talks nonsense (i.e. cannot speak Greek). Insult humor di- rected against foreigners was as common as so-called "ethnic jokes" are today. Aristophanes frequently used this device: witness the character called the King's Eye in the Acharnions who speaks pseudo-Persian and pidgin-Greek, or the foreign god in the Birds whose speech is not fully understood by Hera- kles and Poseidon, or the Scythian guard at the end of the Thes- mophoriazusae whose Greek speech lacks gender and case endings. It is likely that representations of men using drinking horns instead of cups are intended to be caricatures of uncul- tured foreigners.20 Like modern ethnocentric humor, sub- groups within the larger culture divided along racial, economic, geographic or other lines also poked humorous insults at each other. Non-Attic dialects of Greek itself were perceived as funny in Athens, and a hilarious transmutation of this device is common in modern productions of Lysistrata when the Spartan woman Lampito who comes to Athens to join the female rebel- lion speaks and acts like a hillbilly. Nonsense inscriptions and, perhaps, other non-labelling inscriptions may represent insults at the barbarian Etruscan patrons, as may the presence of many unnecessary inscriptions on the Francois Vase, where the artist has gone so far as to label even inanimate objects like rocks and chairs. Vase painters were very aware that the eventual use of their products would likely be in a symposium, the institutionalized drinking party that held an important place in male Greek soci- ety. This awareness is evident not only in inscriptions, but also in representations on the vases, such as those of ships inside the broad bowls of kylikes (broad cups) which, when filled with</page><page sequence="10">298 SOUNDINGS PhÃ¼ip H. Young wine, make the vessels appear to be sailing on the liquid (cf. Homer's "wine-dark sea")- Paintings on the interior tondos of many kylikes were intended to be incongruously funny to the drinker who suddenly found himself staring at an obscene drawing or even the representation of a drunk vomiting or ex- creting due to over-intoxication. On an inscribed kylix by Douris a man on a symposium couch holds a cup in one hand and his other hand to his head and says, "I cannot (sing), no I cannot," which is probably the first line of a drinking song pre- served in Theognis. It has been argued that there is a connec- tion between symposiasts and sea imagery in which the drinkers may have thought of themselves as satiated satyrs floating over the water in wine-skins on a "sea-voyage of merry intoxication."21 A popular myth concerned the god of wine and drunkenness, Dionysos, who was unwittingly captured by pirates at sea with the result, both humorous and terrifying, that they were turned into dolphins. The representation of this story by Exekias, appropriately inside a kylix, illustrates the horrible nemesis of those who meddle with the gods. Humor presumably was as important a social lubricant at a Greek sym- posium as it is today at meetings, parties, business interviews, etc. where it is commonly used to loosen people up and to pro- mote interaction, and often the Greek vase painters made their contribution to this lightheartedness.22 Dionysos or his associates (satyrs and maenads) are fre- quently represented in vase paintings. As illustrated best by Euripides in the Bacchae, the Greeks were fascinated by the am- biguity of this god whose beverage produces merriment and dancing but can also take complete control of a person; it is a conflict of the Rational and the Irrational. For vase painters silly, exuberant, drunken behavior was a common theme, and the humor was usually heightened when the subject was the sub-human satyr or even the female maenad whose assertive behavior would have been especially incongruous for the nor- mally restricted Greek woman. Another favorite character for vase painters, as for the Greeks generally, was Herakles, whose brutal strength had won him a place with the gods but whose general human traits were a recurring source of amusement. "He had faults as large as his virtues and they, too, appeal: no high and remote tragic</page><page sequence="11">Ancient Greek Humar 299 flaws, rather comic flaws, as gluttony and boasting, which give him a very long life as a stock character of low comedy."23 Greek artists enjoyed portraying the exploits of Herakles, and most of these representations whether in major or minor art betray the humorous atmosphere generally associated with him. On carved metopes from Temple Ð¡ at Selinus and the Heraion at Sele the muscular hero strides along carrying the upended Kerkopes, two dwarfs who, when tied upside down to a pole across the hero's shoulders as punishment for trying to steal his weapons, laughed so loudly at his exposed and sun- blackened rump that he let them go. In two well-known vase paintings a huge Herakles disrupts the court of the Egyptian pharaoh Busiris, who was in the habit of sacrificing all strangers, scattering the terrified priests in all directions. Not only would the drawings of small foreigners being overrun appear humorous to a Greek, but on one vase the artist has purposely emphasized their odd dress and cir- cumcised genitals, a condition which would have seemed an uproarious abomination of the human body to the Greeks. A similar joke at barbarian body mutilation is seen in representa- tions of tattooed Thracian women. On an amphora by the Panaitos Painter, Herakles carries Cerberus, the Hound of Hell, back to a terrified Eurystheus, who has assigned him the Labor thinking it impossible. Again, the artist has captured the humorous effect of Herakles intimidating a foreigner who, in this case, tries vainly to hide in a large pithos (large storage vessel). A similar vase painting in the manner of the Antimenes Painter shows him using the Erymanthian Boar to threaten Eu- rystheus, again cowering in a pithos. In a vase painting by the Brygos Painter, the hero, comically dressed in Scythian clothes like an Athenian policemen, rescues Hera, who has been at- tacked by satyrs.24 Greek vase painters found humor in many subjects. In one sexual scene a loving couple risks burning their genitals as they recline towards a long-since forgotten oil lamp. On a Siana cup a dolphin is drawn with arms and hands playing a double-flute. This proto-cartoon is funny for its inherent incongruity, but the humor also involves a verbal pun because the breathing holes of dolphins were called "auloi" ("flutes") by the Greeks. The mythological story of the judgment of Paris is parodied in a</page><page sequence="12">300 SOUNDINGS Philip H. Young vase painting where the three goddesses vying for his vote are represented by the artist as prostitutes. An aryballos with a comic program by the painter Nearchos uses the humorous subject of the battle of the pygmies and cranes around the ves- sel's mouth and includes comically gesticulating figures of Her- mes and Perseus, gibberish inscriptions, and on the side handle an obscene drawing of a masturbating satyr in an experimental frontal pose along with the crude inscription: "He is enjoying it."25 Two specific classes of fourth-century non-Attic pottery called phlyax vases (from South Italy and Sicily) and Kabeiran vases (from Boeotia) abound with comic representations.26 The phlyax vases show comic performances similar to Attic satyr plays with padded dancers who parody tragedies, bur- lesque gods and heroes, and make farces out of scenes from daily life. Frequently, the gods are butts of the humorous drawings, such as a scene showing a captured Antigone, who removes "her" wig showing the male actor's bald head, or one in which Oedipus and Krear argue while a hag-like sphinx with sagging breasts and phallic tail watches. On another, Herakles is shown turning aside towards sexual adventure while his com- panions try to remind him of his sense of duty. Kabeiran vase paintings also use grotesque or cartoon-like figures to parody literary or mythological situations, such as one showing a bald- ing Odysseus with large belly addressing an ugly woman who is the enchantress Circe. Practical Joke Pottery Humor in the Greek pottery industry was not confined to vase painters, as demonstrated by the discovery of several "trick vases." Some are clearly intended as practical jokes, such as a Geometric vessel which looks like a set of nested skyphoi (small cups) but is really a single one, or a kantharos (large cup) which has a false bottom to shortchange the drinker. Various lekythoi (bottles) are known which use con- cealed internal containers for the same effect of having an in- congruously small capacity compared to their outside appearance. Another example of a practical joke vase is a sixth century kylix made with a hole from the bowl into the foot and a hole across the foot horizontally. This arrangement allows a</page><page sequence="13">Ancient Greek Humor 301 stopper initially preventing the drink from flowing out of the bowl to be withdrawn later by a jokester who uses a string to pull the pin out causing an "accident." Other vases are known whose humorous effects were less blatant than a soiled drinker. One is a kylix whose internal "plumbing" allows it to be submerged in a container with its lip kept above the surface and yet to fill with drink which does not run out when the kylix is removed from the container. Other even more complex "magic" vessels are amphoras (jars) with hidden reservoirs closed by the operator's finger which permit the vessel to be "emptied" and mysteriously replenished as many as ten times. Several so-called "rattling cups' have been discovered which may have been props for humorous effect, although an alternative explanation would link them with reli- gious rites. These vessels have hollow feet or rims with pellets inside which rattle when the cups are tipped, and one has an enigmatic inscription which could be interpreted to read: "a pair of jokes for Apollo, two for one." These Greek "trick vases" are paralleled by other vessels through history with funny drawings or hidden plumbing, such as the "Cadogan Teapot" of the nineteenth century that was filled through a hole in its base or the so-called "dribble-cup" to be found at any novelty store.27 Humor in Hellenistic Art We have touched elsewhere on the Greek interest in the hu- mor of grotesques and old people in both art and literature. Aristotle identified the role of deformity in comedy, citing the use of grotesque comic masks which were always worn in Greek drama as an example. Aging is a process that anyone can easily identify with, and exaggeration of its debilitations produces a tragi-comic result. Greek artists of the fourth century and Hel- lenistic periods explored various psychological states in both minor and major works. Often their representations of old age or drunkenness have the humorous tone of insult, just as comic playwrights made fun of these same types and the gods were thought to have laughed at lame Hephaistos. In their explora- tion of unusual or exaggerated subjects, Hellenistic artists de- veloped the inherently incongruous figure of Hermaphrodite, a half man and half female figure, whose concept has a clearly</page><page sequence="14">302 SOUNDINGS Philip Ð¯. Young humorous undercurrent, as well as the more obvious psycho- sexual overtones. Pygmies were often used in Hellenistic art for parodying mythological scenes, as we have seen them in the Archaic period battling with cranes. Humor in Greek Philosophy The Greek philosophers examined the nature of humor and especially its expression in formal comedy. Apparently, Socra- tes cited impotent people as natural objects of laughter. Plato considered humor to be a subdivision of the Ridiculous and a malicious and reprehensible gloating over the misfortunes of others. He said that "there is no man who in the habit of laughing at another does not miss virtue and earnestness alto- gether," although he himself sometimes wrote in a comic vein, for example his characterization of Aristophanes in the Symposium.28 Aristotle's full treatment of humor is, unfortunately, no longer extant, but surviving references indicate that he was in general agreement with Plato. He accused comedy of imitating worse than average men (tragedy, of course, imitating better than average). He criticized writers of comedy for looking for faults like slander and gossip and inventing incidents and char- acters. If reconstructions of the tenth-century Tractatus Coislini- anus truly reflect an Aristotelian Poetics II, it appears that in his detailed examination of comedy Aristotle separated humor from diction and humor from action. Thus, Aristotle observed that comic writers utilized word-plays of various types as well as impossible and unexpected plot twists for humorous effect, just as the writer of any modern "sit-com" would do. Other ancient writers were also interested in defining and ex- plaining humor. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus continued his mentor's analysis, but of his works entitled "On Humor" and "On Comedy" only a few references preserved by later writers remain.29 Conclusions The ancient Greek sense of humor was well-developed, and we can recover examples of it in surviving literature and arti- facts. This is not surprising for the people who invented for- mal comedy and who prided themselves on their wit and</page><page sequence="15">Ancient Greek Humar 303 cleverness. The most popular stories of the Greeks centered on the Trojan War, which in the end was won not by force of arms or heroic deeds but by a trick using the false prize of a wooden horse to gain entry into the city. The most admired Greek hero of legend was crafty Odysseus, whose clever and often blatantly humorous stratagems got him out of many a tough spot. The examples we have cited support several generalizations about Greek humor which show it to be much like humor found in other cultures. The Greeks enjoyed all the humorous incon- gruities of life and made them a part of their rich and witty culture. An example is the joke that Pheidias' colossal statue of Zeus seated on his throne in the temple at Olympia was so big that if he stood up he would lift the roof on his shoulders. The Greeks liked the humor of insult, never missing an opportunity to laugh at someone less fortunate or different from them- selves. They enjoyed historical tidbits such as the one pre- served by Herodotus about Kleisthenes, the tyrant of Sikyon, who changed the names of rival tribes to "Pigmen, Assmen and Swinemen." The Greeks loved the humor in indecency. They probably roared with laughter when an actor in an Aristophanic comedy "accidentally" defecated on stage, or at a vase painting showing a drunken satyr balancing a kylix on his erect organ. They even imagined that the head of their pantheon chased mortal women and boys across the land for sexual sport. The openness of Greek indecent humor contrasts with operative norms in contemporary America. Greek ethnocentrism is evi- dent in the many examples of humor directed at foreigners, es- pecially those with contrasting religious practices. Humor at the expense of religion should not be taken to mean that religion was unimportant to the Greeks. Rather, its popularity demonstrates the reverse, a view clearly proven by the great works of religious architecture whose extant remains epitomize ancient Greek culture for us today. Anthropologists have found religious humor to be a common feature of many societies.30 Humor often derives from overstepping the bounds of proper behavior, such as insulting an authority fig- ure or making fun of religion. Modern Americans who tend to be church-goers enjoy religious jokes, but serious attacks on religion are treated with great concern today and were in an-</page><page sequence="16">304 SOUNDINGS Philip H. Young rient Greece, as Socrates found out. Parodying the Eleusinian Mysteries may have been popular at private parties in Athens, but public revelations of such hijinks had severe results. The greatest Athenian scandal involved mutilation of the ubiqui- tous, ithyphallic statues called "herms" just before the start of the ill-fated Sicilian Expedition in 415 B.C. This incident was taken not as a humorous prank but as an insidious political and religious outrage. On one hand, Greek religion with its child- like stories and bumbling, anthropomorphic deities was an easy target for humor. On the other hand, the Greek gods repre- sented powerful natural and psychological forces, ever-present and all-powerful, with which mortals contended at their own peril. The study of ancient Greek humor has important implica- tions both for historians and for humor theorists. Because it has been shown that "most of the manifestations of humor are in popular culture arenas,"31 examples of Greek humor often reveal information about the lives of ordinary people as op- posed to the elite usually encountered by students of historical events or classic literature. The great themes of war, govern- ment, and economics are illuminated by intimate glimpses of the common person's life, such as an Athenian at the theater laughing at Aristophanes' crude jokes or a vase painter smiling to himself as he draws a muscular Herakles overturning weak, effeminate-looking Egyptian priests. In addition to fleshing out political history, the study of humor adds a new dimension for interpreting works of art, in particular the minor arts. Along with many other themes and meanings (religious, aesthetic, narrative, illustrative of myth or literature, etc.), the possibility of humorous themes and overtones must be considered in the interpretation of artistic expression. The ancient Greek record demonstrates that the humor of a "dead" civilization can be at least partially reconstructed and examined through surviving literature and artifacts. It is signif- icant that the themes of incongruity, insult, and indecency which have been identified as important elements of contempo- rary humor are readily apparent in ancient Greek humor as well. This diachronic evidence supplements synchronie, cross- cultural studies and indicates that many basic principles of hu- mor are not culture-specific. The fact that so many characters</page><page sequence="17">Ancient Greek Humor 305 and stratagems of Greek humor are easily recognizable today is profound evidence of both the "panhuman"32 basis of humor and the fundamental linkage of contemporary western civiliza- tion to its Greco-Roman heritage, a thread so evident in other arenas such as political institutions, literature, language, art and architecture. Ancient Greek humor depicts people who enjoyed life with its uncertainties and contradictions, and in their poking fun at each other or at authority figures or their laughter at blatant obscenities we can identify constants in the human experience that close the gap between them and us. The specifics of Greek humor reveal how these constants were worked out in their dis- tinct culture, giving it a unique character. The Greek sense of humor is perhaps best illustrated in the Spartan's retort at Thermopylae to the arrogance of the invading Persians' threat to darken the sun with a multitude of arrows, that these were excellent tidings because the Greeks would be well content to fight in the shade.33 NOTES 1.
