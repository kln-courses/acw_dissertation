<plain_text><page sequence="1">Land of Hidden Fires (Loynde eldars land), by Tarjei Vesaas, trans., intro. by Fritz Konig and Jerry Crisp, Wayne State Univ. Press, 125 pp., $9.95. This expert and dedicated homage to the poetry of a well known Norwegian novelist is also an important cultural essay in miniature. Its compact intro- duction, on language and litera- ture in Norway, skillfully por- trays a people harshly divided- linguistically, politically-ever at odds with a demanding climate of natural extremes that enlivens even as it assaults them. Images drawn from extremes such as these are the motive forces be- hind Vesaas' poems. Though sev- eral are conventionally descrip- tive, the best of his lyrics are sharp glimpses at the life latent beneath surface appearances ("Glass under Tension"), the powerful pulling force nature ex- erts on human life ("If you only understood that all your thoughts /are moved by the waves' roll . . ."). Vesaas' real subtlety is to show how men are, naturally, products of a complex doubleness-al- ways fascinated, drawn by the natural world, but kept remote from its distant, uncomprehend- able core. One marvelous image will show the method: birch trees, with slender "white legs," stand watch outside the window of a sleeping child; they are a comforting anthropomorphic presence, but also a powerful in- carnation of mysterious sensual- ity. "Hidden fires" are answering forces embedded within us, deep- er in than we can suspect. In these vivid and distinctive poems, they flare up with startling sig- nificances.</page></plain_text>
