INTRODUCTION In 1979, Hector Catling delivered a lecture at Sheffield University, entitled 'Cyprus and the West 1600-1050 b.c.'. The text was published in 1980, and it includes a brilliant discussion of the relationship between Cyprus and the Aegean, though little mention is made of the Tar West', that is, of the west Mediterranean area. Recent finds and research have greatly increased our knowledge of possible connections between Cyprus of the Late Bronze Age and the west Mediterranean area, and the principal purpose of this article is to bring these to the attention of scholars. For some time now, it has been realised that Late Cypriot elements could be isolated within the general context of east Mediterranean or Aegean exchange or trade with Italy during the Italian Late Bronze Age; the major sources are set out below. In 1958, Lord William Taylour in his fundamental study on the Mycenaean pottery found in Italy (Taylor 1958) noted several affinities between Mycenaean vases found in Sicily and Southern Italy and Mycenaean vases found in Cyprus: he also mentioned the ox-hide ingots found in Sardinia, referring them broadly to the Aegean examples.</page><page sequence="2">2 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI After the pioneer study by Pigorini (1904), the ox-hide ingots were thoroughly discussed by Buchholz (1959), who gave a full catalogue for the time. Ih 1964 Cypriot Bronzework in the Mycenaean World was published, in which magnificent study Hector Catling assembled all the evidence of Cypriot bronzework including many classes of objects, which had received little attention to date.1 In Catling's monograph (1964) the bronzes from the Cape Gelidonya wreck are widely discussed and the full report on this wreck, among whose cargo were ox-hide ingots, tools and fragments from tripod-stands, were published by G. Bass (1967). In 1968, the bronze basin found by Paolo Orsi at Caldare at the end of the last century was compared with the Enkomi basin by L. Vagnetti, who suggested it was an actual import and who tried to assemble the evidence for specific Cypriot, as apart from Mycenaean, elements in Italy at this time (Vagnetti 1968). She also proposed that a contemporary sea-route round the south coast of Sicily to Sardinia existed; this hypothesis was supported by the recent discussion by A. M. Bisi of the bronze figurine of Adad or Reshef found in the sea near Selinunte (Bisi 1968). In 1970 E. Macnamara drew attention to the likeness between the Surbo hammer-heads and those from the Foundry Hoard at Énkomi (Macnamara 1970), and in 1971 L. Vagnetti published in detail the so- called Makarska hoard, composed of Cypriot bronzes and allegedly found on the Dalmatian coast, indicating that this provenance should be dismissed (Vagnetti 1971). The discovery in 1968 of a miniature tripod-stand of Late Cypriot III tradition in the votive cave of Santadi and subsequently published by Lilliu (1973) gave fresh stimulus for the discussion. Lilliu correctly identified the piece as of Sardinian manufacture and recognised its Late Cypriot background. However, following the views current at the time, he argued that manufacture of tripod-stands in Sardinia must post-date the arrival of the Phoenicians. The publication of the Contigliano hoard (Ponzi Bonomi 1970) permitted further research upon the imported objects of east Mediterranean origin, and L. Vagnetti (1974) tried to clarify the implication of these important finds from the lower Tiber valley. The puzzling presence of the 'Cypriot daggers' in Europe has a wide biblio- graphy. S. Gerloff (1975) and T. Watkins (1976) dedicated the most recent and comprehensive studies to this subject, though reaching opposite conclusions; the former advanced the hypothesis of the possibility that the hook-tanged daggers could be the prototype of the Wessex daggers in Britain; the latter dismissed the whole class in Western Europe as modern imports. The addition made by F. Lo Schiavo (1978b, 1980) of two new examples of this particular type of weapon, allegedly found in central Sardinia, once again raised the problem and was a starting point for continuing interest and close analysis of Cypriot connections with Sardinia.

In 1982, for the British Museum Colloquium, E. Macnamara and D. and F. Ridgway undertook the full study of the S. Maria in Paulis hoard, which includes a Sardinian imitation of a Late Cypriot tripod-stand and a bronze double-axe (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984). The writers believe that there is now enough archaeological evidence to require a new and comprehensive study of the subject. They have confined the field of this article to the Late Cypriot imports to Italy and the influence of these imports upon some subsequent bronze typologies of Italy. The whole question of Aegean contacts .with Italy and the strong north-south Adriatic trade of the thirteenth century is omitted.2 Flat axes, chisels and trunnion axes have deliberately been avoided, since they cannot be said to present a specific Cypriot character. We did not include fibulae, which have been the subject of many inconclusive studies, since they represent a topic that does not imply only a relationship between Cyprus and Italy but involves several other possible ways of transmission (Levant, Aegean, Balkans). Moreover we feel that this class of objects cannot be treated properly without a complete availability of the corpus of archaeological evidence that is now in preparation for northern and southern Italy (von Eles, forthcoming, Lo Schiavo, forthcoming). The Phoenicians are clearly excluded from this study for chronological reasons, though the writers are perfectly aware that Cyprus played a role in the Phoenician colonial expansion.3 Of the three authors, F. Lo Schiavo is responsible for the treatment of hook- tanged weapons, ingots, double-axes and smithing tools, E. Macnamara for tripod- stands and figurines and L. Vagnetti for pottery, mirrors and metal vessels and their attachments. The introduction and the conclusions were written in collaboration and the principle of collective responsibility applies for the whole study. II. POTTERY Among the pottery of Aegean provenance found in Italy, some has been attributed to Cypriot manufacture for a long time. In fact some sherds and vessels can be perhaps better classified as Cypro-Mycenaean than as purely Mycenaean. However, only in recent years have some pieces belonging to wares typical of Cyprus been throughout this article the Italian Late Bronze Age is taken as the span of time from c. 1250 to c. 900 b.c., with the same value as in Italian terminology Bronzo tardo including Bronzo recente and Bronzo finale.</page><page sequence="5">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 5 identified, giving to the problem a new interest. Hereafter different classes of Cypriot and Cypro-Mycenaean wares found in Italy are briefly treated with an evaluation of their chronological range. i. White-shaved Ware 1. Thapsos (Siracusa). Tomb D. Juglet, h. 19.5 cm. Mus. Siracusa; inv. 69335 (Voza 1973, 36, pl. 7, 87). Fig. 2, 1. In the same tomb were found the two juglets of base-ring type discussed below, together with imported Mycenaean pottery and local pottery of the Thapsos culture. The White-shaved ware is very common in Cyprus and is usually assigned to Cypriot production, although numerous examples of it have been found in Syria and Palestine, and occasionally in Egypt (Sjòqvist 1940, 33, 77f.; Astròm 1972, 221-5; 1972b, 745; Dothan, Ben-Tor 1983, 41; Gittlen 1977, 343-56). The chronology of this ware encompasses the Late Cypriot I and Late Cypriot II A-B although it seems to continue later (Dothan?, Ben-Tor 1983, 43). The juglet from Thapsos belongs to Sjòqvist type lb (Sjòqvist 1940, fig. 6) and Astròm type la (Astròm 1972, fig. 58, 7). ii. Base-ring II ware 1. Thapsos (Siracusa). Tomb D. Juglet, h. 13.3 cm. Mus. Siracusa; inv. 69336 (Voza 1973, 36, pl. 7, 85). Fig. 2, 2. 2. Thapsos (Siracusa). Tomb D. Juglet, h. 14. 4 cm. Mus. Siracusa; inv. 69337 (Voza 1973, 36, pl. 7, 86). Fig. 2, 3. 3. Sarroch (Cagliari). Nuraghe Antigori, room A. Small base probably belonging to a closed vessel; diam. 6.2 cm. Mus. Cagliari.4 Fig. 2, 4. 4. Sarroch. (Cagliari). Nuraghe Antigori. Room C. Fragmentary wishbone handle possibly belonging to a bowl. Stratified with local pottery and with some sherds of Aegean type; 1. 5.7 cm. Mus. Cagliari (Ferrarese Ceruti, forthcoming). Fig. 2,' 5. The base ring ware is one of the most typical productions of the Late Cypriot II period and was exported widely to the Syro-Palestinian region and to Egypt (Sjòqvist 1940, 80-2; Astròm 1972, 1 73-97; 1972b, 738-41; Merrillees 1968; Gittlen 1977, 80-105). It occurs also in the Aegean but apparently only on Rhodes (Cadogan 1972, 6). The two juglets from Thapsos are of unmistakably Base-ring II shape; however, their fabric is not Cypriot but could be Levantine. To real Cypriot manufacture can be attributed the two sherds from Nuraghe Antigori. iii. Cypro-Mycenaean pottery The existence of a special class of pottery, Mycenaean in technique, but using a range of shapes typical of Cyprus, has been recognised for a long time. This class of pottery, usually named Levanto-Helladic or Levanto-Mycenaean, is well known also on the facing Levantine coast and is particularly common in the Late Helladic IIIB. Among the mass of imported Mycenaean sherds from Scoglio del Tonno two can be attributed to this Levanto-Mycenaean class: 3See for up-to-date references Niemeyer (ed.) 1982. 4Best thanks to M. L. Ferrarese Ceruti for the kind permission to illustrate this sherd.</page><page sequence="6">6 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI Fig. 2.

Part of a shallow bowl with everted rim, decorated with "brown bands inside and stripes and lines outside. A pattern of linked S's (FM 48:5) on the lip is superimposed in white; diam. 18 cm. Mus.

It is decorated with red stripes outside and with bands inside. Blobs of paint on the handle; diam. 17 cm. Mus. Taranto (Taylour 1958, 101, 87, pl. 12, 13; Biancofiore 1967, pl. 34 a-b). Fig. 2, 6. The shallow bowl no. 1 belongs to a type almost exclusive of Cyprus and of the opposite Levantine coast (Stubbings 1951, 40, fig. 8, pls. 12, 16, 1-6; Karageorghis 1965, fig. 50, 2 with white paint on the lip) and seems to find its main diffusion in the Late Helladic III B period. The cup no. 2 displays a type of handle typically Cypriot; in general its shape is directly inspired by the so called 'milk-bowls' that are one of the most common shapes of the White slip ware, a very common class of Late Cypriot pottery (M. Popham, in Astròm 1972, 431-71; 1972b, 699-705). Although we maintain as probable the hypothesis that these two sherds are Cypriot,. one must take into consideration the fact that Cypriot features such as wish-bone handles, are adopted from time to time in Mycenaean pottery; moreover, recent finds of Cypriot and Levanto-Helladic pottery in Mycenaean Greece indicate the possibility that this pottery could have been traded to Italy through Greece.5 Apart from the sherds discussed above, belonging to classes of pottery typical of Cyprus, it is worth mentioning the fact that some of the Mycenaean pottery found in various sites in Italy has convincing parallels only among the Mycenaean pottery from Cyprus. Some of these parallels have already been noticed by Taylour (1958, 66, 131-2, 187-90) and Kilian (1969, 346-8) and now we add the beautiful rhyton from nuraghe Antigori (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981, fig. M 4; 1982, pl. 63, 5) decorated with FM 18 + FM 23, which has an exact parallel in a rhyton from Enkomi tomb 70 (Murray et al. 1900, fig. 75, 1114). The two rhyta can well be dated to the Late Helladic III B: I.6 5New evidence for this possibility came to light recently at Tiryns, where Cypriot pottery as well as Cypriot features have been found; Cypriot White slip milk bowl (Kilian 1981, 184, fig. 40, 5); Levanto- Helladic shallow bowls (Podzuweit 1981, 199, fig. 51; 1983, 399-400, fig. 18); wishbone handle on Mycenaean pottery (ibid., fig. 17); wall bracket of Cypriot type (BCH, CVII, 1983, 761, fig. 31). Benzi (Benzi, Graziadio 1982, 29ff.) in a survey of the provenance of the Mycenaean pottery found in Italy, casts some doubts about the possibility of a direct trade between Cyprus and the central Mediterranean on the basis of the pottery. In fact, if the evidence of the pottery were not supported by a wide range of evidence deriving from other classes of objects, especially from bronzework, this article could not have been written. 6We do not include among the possible examples of Cypro-Mycenaean pottery the few sherds of pictorial style found in Italy, since they find parallels also on the Greek mainland (Termi ti to: De Siena 1982, pls. 22-3; Scoglio del Tonno: Biancofiore 1967, pl. 12, 145; 23, 134; 24, 158; Avetrana; Biancofiore 1967, pl. 33, 276; Pozzomaggiore: Lo Schiavo, Vagnetti, forthcoming). Pictorial sherds found at Tharros seem to be later than the late second millennium b.c. (Acquaro 1982, pl. 26, 1, 3; 1983, pl. 17, 1; 18, 1). For a possible interpretation see Lo Schiavo, Vagnetti, forthcoming. We would also like to point out that a sherd from Antigori (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981, fig. M5), belonging to a big semi-coarse container, has a feature that is very common in Cyprus, although not exclusive to the island: it is that the extremity of the handle pierces the wall of the vase and protrudes inside. However, the detail is known also in Crete, an area which displays several connections with Antigori (Vagnetti, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="8">8 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI iv. Cypriot influence on local pottery As a last point the possible connections between Cypriot and local Italian pottery shapes should be briefly treated. The first shape to be considered is the strainer spouted jug, known in Sicily since Pantalica I phase and at Lipari since the Ausonian II. This shape has been connected with Phoenician trade (Bernabò Brea 1964-65, 2 1-22) . It is indeed well represented in the Levant in the Late Bronze Age, but it was adopted in Cyprus and in the Aegean mainly during the twelfth century b.c. This consideration and a detailed analysis of the known examples led R. Leigh ton (1981) to the conclusion that the shape may have arrived in Sicily via the Aegean. I would like to add that Cyprus could be a possible valid alternative, especially taking into account that the Cypriot component of Late Bronze Age trade seems to have been rather active in Sicily during the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries b.c. A more vague influence can be claimed on some Ausonian I and II bowls with inverted rim that display a wishbone handle, a feature typical of Cypriot pottery as we have stressed above (Bernabò Brea, Cavalier 1980, pl. 103, 3b, 220, 1; Podzuweit 1983, 399, note304).7 v. Red Lustrous Wheel-made ware. A correction After the discovery of the Mycenaean pottery at Antigori in Sardinia some sherds belonging to the same classes have been identified from other sites in Sardinia. M. L. • Ferrarese Ceruti promptly published some sherds from Nuraghe Domu s' Orku and from the nuragic village at Barumini (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981, figs. M 16-17; 1982b, pl. 64, 10-12). The sherds from Barumini deserve some comment. One of them (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981, fig. M 16) belongs to a class of pottery widely represented in nuraghe Antigori with a leather-colour burnished surface and a decoration in red or violet paint, usually rather matt. It is certainly produced under Aegean influence but the area of production (which in the opinion of the writer could even be Sardinia) is still a matter of discussion. The second sherd (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981, fig. M 17), certainly not Mycenaean, has been published as belonging to the lower part of an open vessel; on this assumption and after a first direct examination, the present writer proposed to assign it to Red Lustrous Wheel-made ware, possibly traded via Cyprus, where this class of pottery is extremely common (Vagnetti 1982, 212).8 Further research and a thesis discussed in Cagliari University on the material from the same hut (no. 20) at Barumini, brought to light other sherds belonging to the same vessel.9 Now it should be more correctly reconstructed as a closed vessel with a ridge at the base of the neck, a shape not represented in the very restricted 7As far as later material is concerned, Cypro-Geometric influence has been proposed by Taylour (1958, 76-7) on the trefoil mouthed jugs of S. Angelo Muxaro culture. This point has been accepted by other scholars including the present writer (Vagnetti 1968, 134). A thorough study of S. Angelo Muxaro pottery due to V. Fatta (1983, 120-3) rejects with good arguments such a connection, but seems to underestimate other possible Gypriot influences on Late Bronze Aere Sicily. 8Open shapes oí Red Lustrous fabric: Ástrom 1972, fig. 54, 1-2. On this class of pottery and on the unsolved problem of the place of production: Sjòqvist 1940, 51-2, 85; Amiran, 1970, 167-71; Courtois 1978, 256-9. 9The Barumini sherd is of light brown clay with inclusions. It is wheel-made and its surface is of deep red colour (10 R 4/6) well burnished, which flakes easily off.</page><page sequence="9">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 9 range of shapes known for the Red Lustrous fabric. This fact led to a reconsideration of the sherd and to the exclusion of the first hypothesis. In consideration of the context found in the same hut, that includes material datable from the late second to the early first millennium b.c., and of typological and fabric affinities, the sherd could be better ascribed to Red Slip ware of Phoenician production of the Iron Age, a date that is compatible with the local context.10 We leave the full publication of the sherd and the evaluation of the historical consequences to specialists of Phoenician pottery, stressing that it seems to be one of the earliest imports of Phoenician pottery of near eastern production found in Sardinia.11 III. HOOK-TANGED WEAPONS Two daggers of this class, belonging to very different types, are known from Sardinia and were found, according to the former owner, together with eight other tanged daggers and with a spear-head and a spear-butt, in an unknown site, possibly in Ottana district (Nuoro province). Type la: Oval blade with double-convex and thick section, short and sloping shoulders, thick tang whose section varies from elliptic, square to circular at the tip; 1 . 31. 7 cm. Fig. 3, 1. Type 1 b: Oval leaf-shaped blade with flat central midrib, short and straight shoulders, thin tang with square section; 1. 19 cm. (Lo Schiavo 1978b, 77, pl. 23, 1-2; 1980a, 341-2, figs. 1-2). Fig. 3, 2. Though the sloping shoulder is a distinctive character of the Late Cypriot 'rat- tail' tanged weapons in Catling's classification, the absence of the strong, square midrib, mostly of 'four-winged bayonet type' jnakes unlikely any hypothesis of direct import from Cyprus. Rather, the association with daggers of western affinity (Arreton Down) suggests the possibility of a local Sardinian production, in the last two centuries of the local Middle Bronze Age (fifteenth-fourteenth centuries b.c.). In this case, these weapons should be the most ancient proof of relationships between Cyprus and Sardinia.12 10Amiran 1970, 272-3, fig. 285; Pr,ausnitz 1982, fig. 4a. I thank most warmly A. Giasca, M. G. Guzzo Amadasi and D. Ridgway who discussed the problem with me. Obviously the responsibility of the opinion expressed remains mine. Among the Red slip pottery preserved in the collection of Near Eastern antiquities in the University of Rome, there is a Phoenician Red slip jug from Ramat Rahel, not too far from the Barumini sherd in quality, both for the colour of the clay, rather dark and not highly refined, and for the aspect of the surface that is dark red and burnished. 1 'Among the recent works on the subject see Bartoloni 1983 with bibliography. A relationship with the Red slip pottery of Phoenician manufacture found at Pithecoussai is also possible (Buchner 1982; Ridgway 1984, 124 ff.). On the Pithecoussai-Sardinia relationship in the second half of the eighth century b.c. see Ridgway, forthcoming. 12Gatling's comment to these weapons, at the time of their publication was '. . . they are uncharacteristic and unlikely to be of Gypriot origin "direct" though I suppose that they were made by a bronzesmith who was familiar with this class of weapons in his Cypriot form.'

OX-HIDE INGOTS This major archaeological connection between the east and west Mediterranean areas was first pointed out by Pigorini when the group of 19 ox-hide ingots was found at Ayia Triada in Crete; he called attention to the three similar ingots in the</page><page sequence="11">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 1 1 Cagliari Museum, found with two others at Serra llixi (Nuragus, Nuoro) 46 years earlier and acquired for the State collections by Giovanni Spano (Pigorini 1904; Spano 1857, 1858). From that time on, they have been the subject of many publications and the number discovered in Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, Turkey and the Levant has risen to hundreds. Extensive studies on ox-hide ingots have been made by Buchholz (1959; 1967), Catling (1964, 266), Bass (1967, 52), Parise (1967), Maddin Muhly and Wheeler (Mùhly 1973, 1977, 1979, 1980; Maddin, Muhly 1974; Muhly, Maddin, Wheeler 1977, 1980; Stech Wheeler, Maddin, Muhly 1975, 1979), Lo Schiavo and Vagnetti (1980), Balmuth and Tylecote (1976), Zwicker, Virdis, Ceruti (1980), Tylecote, Balmuth, Massoli Novelli (1983), Merkel (forthcoming). The main topics are the circumstances of the finds and their chronology, distribution and trade, the marks impressed and incised on them, the weight, the chemical and metallurgical composi- tion and copper ores, the technique of production and the shape.13 It is hardly possible to summarise the results of such a wide and complex discussion, largely because new discoveries are constantly taking place and opening up new problems, such as the ox-hide ingots from the Lipari Acropolis hoard (Bernabé Brea, Cavalier 1980), the mould for an ox-hide ingot from Ras Ibn Hani (Lagarce, Bounni, Saliby 1983, 277-90), the new wreck with an extraordinary cargo of copper and tin ox-hide ingots from Kas (Mellink 1984, 450) and the many new finds of fragments of ox-hide ingots in archaeological contexts from Turkey (Bogazkòy: Müller-Karpe, A. 1980, 303, 304), Cyprus (Pyla-Kokkinokremos: Karageorghis, Demás 1984) and from Sardinia (Galli 1984; Fadda 1983). Cautiously expressed, it now seems that the chronology of the ox-hide ingots runs from the end of Middle Minoan III and Late Minoan I- II (sixteenth-fifteenth century b.c.: Ayia Triada, Zakros, Knossos, Tylissos, . . .) to the twelfth century, but fragments can be still found in Early Iron Age contexts in the West (Sardinia); the chronological division of the different shapes as defined by Buchholz seems to be no longer acceptable. The chronology of the marks remains an open problem. The hypothesis of one centre of production of all ox-hide ingots in the east and the west is generally dismissed; incontrovertible proof of provenance associating a group of ox-hide ingots with a particular ore-body through chemical and metal- lurgical analyses has not been successful, while the lead isotope analysis, sometimes claimed to be capable of solving the problem, is still under discussion (Brill, Wampler 1967; Gale, Stos Gale 1982; Muhly 1983; Virdis, Zwicker, Begemann, Todt 1983). No certain conclusion has been reached about the system of production; some scholars believe in primary smelting directly from the ores, others tend toward the secondary melting from raw metal. The recurrence of a broadly common weight leads us to consider the ox-hide ingot not as a currency but rather as a general standard of metal guaranteed for its purity, but which, upon purchase, was subject to weighing and to the necessities of evaluation according to trade and exchange. From an archaeological and historical I3These are only the most important and recent publications on the subject, which give all the previous bibliography.</page><page sequence="12">12 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI point of view it seems highly probable that a few major copper mining centres existed, from which the metal was traded to a larger number of sites where the ox- hide ingots were produced, from which again they were shipped or traded by land to all the sites where they have been found, and there subsequently cut and used in the melting operation, with the addition of tin, whose trade routes remain to be traced (Muhly 1978; de Jesus 1978). In the west, as far as Sardinia is concerned, the island is rich in copper ores and many ox-hide ingots, both complete and fragmentary, have been found; it can be Fig. 4.

Capoterra</page><page sequence="13">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 13 suggested that it was a partly autonomous centre of mining production and internal distribution of this item. Certainly of external origin are the shape of the ox-hide ingots and their Cypro-Minoan marks, although when and by what intermediary is not yet known: in fact, either the Mycenaeans when they first came to Sardinia (Late Helladic III B-C) or the Cypriots of Late Cypriot III, whose activities in the West we are here trying to investigate, could have been responsible for the introduction of the four-handled shape, perhaps in an attempt to build up a system similar to the one in use in the Aegean and in the Levant. The reason why it is not possible to clarify this crucial problem is the absence in Sardinia of good chronological associations, though there is hope that this can soon be achieved; instead, in some cases the use of ox-hide ingot fragments into the Early Iron Age may be attested.

Unknown localities, Cagliari Museum (Lo Schiavo, Vagnetti 1980, 386). 15 Totally different is the problem of Sicilian ox-hide ingots: the first, an isolated fragment from Cannatello (Agrigento) (Mosso 1907, 524) still lacking modern documentation and analysis, and the many pieces in the Lipari Acropolis hoard (Bernabò Brea - Cavalier 1980, 785 ff.), in close association with weapons, orna- ments and tools of the thirteenth-twelfth century b.c., some of them imported from peninsular Italy. Apparently, for the Sicilian ingots the possibility of an eastern provenance seems more plausible than that of a Sardinian origin, since any direct connection between the two islands at such an earlier date is not widely demonstrated, while Aegean imports to and cultural influence on the Aeolian Islands and Sicily are well documented. The question still remains unsolved. 14The references concern only the most recent and exhaustive publications. 15No ox-hide ingots have been found in Sorgono and in Tharros: Buchholz's reports of these are based on a misunderstanding of Spano's texts (Spano 1869, 25; 1873, 21) where he clearly described finding fragments of plano-convex ingots (Sorgono) and of a slab ingot of 50 x 5 cm. (Tharros or, better, nuraghe Mannu in Sinis Peninsula).

DOUBLE-AXES The studies dedicated to or dealing with the double-axes (Petrie 1917; Hawkes 1937; Buchholz 1959; Deshayes 1960; Catling 1964; Macnamara 1970; Harding 1975; Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984) show clearly the wide and complex typology of this class of tools or weapons, including also ceremonial and votive objects, miniature pendants and jewels. Taking the Cypriot double-axes as a starting point, we consider here the massive, rectangular shape widening slightly from socket to cutting edges and with round socket.16 In peninsular Italy this shape is known only from the hoards of Madriolo (Montelius 1895, 185-6, pl. 34, 14-15; Caput Adriae 1983, pl. 15, B5), Chiuse di Frontone (Rellini 1905), Manciano (Peroni 1961, 15, 10), Montagnana (De Min, Bietti Sestieri 1979) and Bologna, San Francesco (Zannoni 1888, pl. 15a) and from Sardinia, apart from a few examples in museums without a certain provenance. A careful observation of the double-axes of Madriolo, Manciano and Mon- tagnana, as well as the accurate description made by Rellini of the pieces from Chiuse di Frontone, reveals some peculiar characteristics that do not correspond to the Cypriot examples. First of all, the trapezoidal section with straight or slightly curving sides reveals a casting in a one-piece or open mould;17 this observation is confirmed by the difference between the upper and the lower surface in the Italian pieces, the former being irregular because of slow cooling in open air (Rellini 1905, 15). It seems also that the general shape of the examples from Italian hoards is more oval, and the widening in correspondence with the socket and the diameter of the socket are inferior to the Cypriot and to many of the Sardinian double-axes. We should consider the examples of Madriolo, Chiuse di Frontone, Manciano and Montagnana as well as the 'saumons9 from Larnaud (Canton de Bletterans, arrond. de Lons-Le-Saunier, Jura: Chantre 1875, 1 16), as non-functional objects or 'ingot-double-axes' that cannot claim much connection with the Cypriot ones. The case of the double-axe in the Bologna, San Francesco hoard is different, being assuredly an ancient import from Sardinia, together with a dagger, a cauldron with a four-spiral attachment and a trefoil-shaped attachment (Lo Schiavo 1981, 302; 1982b, 1982c and p. 33 infra). The double-axe from Bellucci Collection, Perugia is from an unknown prov- enance; the one mentioned by Barfield (1966, 49) now in Castello Sforzesco, Milano, in the Inventory Book is said to come from 'Chianciano' (Siena); the axe in the Archaeological Museum, Firenze comes from Oniferi (Nuoro). In conclusion, leaving aside the 'ingot-double-axes', all the double-axes known in Italy are of Sardinian manufacture of recent or ancient provenance from the island. l6It is not easy to distinguish these features in the double-axes published, even in the repertories mentioned above, due to the bad drawings, and worse photographs, so that the following observations could be widely incomplete. 17No two-piece mould for this shape of double-axe has been found so far in Cyprus or in Sardinia; instead see Chapoutier, Demargne 1942, figs. 37-9, for an example from Mallia (Crete).</page><page sequence="15">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 15 Fig. 5.

It is worth noting that among the Greek miniature double-axes our type I of rectangular shape is not represented, while the very few with a similarity to our type II with slightly concave sides (compare no. 24 with Kilian Dirlmeier, nos. 1632 and 1634) are of unknown provenance.</page><page sequence="17">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 17 Fig. 6.

Two examples of double-axes very similar to the Sardinian Type I are included in the Enkomi Weapon Hoard and the Enkomi Foundry Hoard, dated by Catling respectively to the first half of the twelfth and to the twelfth century b.c. No clear chronological indication can be added by the Sardinian double-axes, mostly surface finds and from Museum deposits and private collections. Only recently the Santa Maria in Paùlis hoard has been studied and dated to the Late Bronze Age (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984); it is interesting to stress the fact that from Samugheo is said to come a double-axe, possibly identified in a piece without inventory number in Cagliari Museum; and in the same district a hoard has been found, in which Ellen Macnamara recognised the upper ring of a Cypriot stand (Taramelli 1903, fig. 19). Also in a private collection, at Oristano, are collected a double-axe and a Cypriot tripod-stand, together with big fire tongs and a shovel, which it is only reasonable to suppose were found in the same site and constitute a complex (see infra, p. 36, 24, 27). An application of the Late Bronze Age chronology to the other Sardinian double-axes can be fully accepted, not only for Ossi, Sa Mandra 5e Sa Giua, the nuragic village where also ox-hide ingots had been found (Contu 1966, 437; 1967, 205; 1968, 428; Lo Schiavo, Vagnetti 1980, 381), and for Tula (if the attribution of the two double-axes is correct) where, according to Spano's description many of them were stuck in six big holes in the ground, full of charcoal and ashes (Spano 1872, 28). The same chronology is plausible for the objects found near nuraghe Su Cobelciu, Chiaramonti, a big wedge (or anvil?) of a peculiar shape, comparable to the specimen from the foundation deposit of Temple 4 at Kition (Karageorghis 1976, pl. XV; Lo Schiavo 1984, pl. IV, 4) and three flanged axes of different sizes</page><page sequence="19">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 19 Fig. 7. Double-axes. Type II. 1. Ozieri 2. Sarule 3. Bonorva 4-5.

A similar wedge (or anvil?) comes from the Chilivani hoard in association with two double-axes and with other weapons and tools (Taramelli 1922, 292, fig. 4). A wide chronological range, but mostly the late Bronze Age from the twelfth century b.c. on, can be assigned to the material coming from the nuragic sanctuary</page><page sequence="20">20 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI of S. Vittoria, Serri (Taramelli 1909, 1911, 1914, 1922b, 1931): the bronze violin- bow leaf fibula is of Late Helladic III C date (Taramelli 1931, fig. 15a; Lo Schiavo 1978, 28), and there is a Tiryns type amber bead (Taramelli 1922, 321, fig. 47, identified in Cagliari Museum by Ellen Macnamara) and again a fragment of a local imitation of a Cypriot tripod-stand (Lo Schiavo 1984, pl. VI, 1) (see infra, p. 47). The same could be said of Abini, Teti (Pais 1884; Pinza 1901, 150-6), if the votive hoards related to the sacred well and to the sanctuary could be individually reconstructed; now all the objects, excavated at different times and by different treasure hunters and private collectors, are completely mixed up. Also from Teti is said to come a fragment of an ox-hide ingot (Lo Schiavo, Vagnetti 1980, 381-2). The chronological, typological and internal cross-association of types and shapes closely connects Sardinian double-axes to the Cypriot ones. To the two examples of Enkomi we must add the others from Cape Gelidonya (Bass 1967, 95, nn. 102-3). While in Cyprus as in Sardinia all the double-axes and bronze tools have a round shaft-hole, in the Cape Gelidonya cargo, perhaps due to the presence of objects of extra-Cypriot provenance, there is a double-axe with oval shaft-hole of pure Aegean style. In fact, though it is arguable that Cyprus derived the shape of the double-axe and the device of the round shaft-hole from Crete, there is no doubt that the distribution of the same device totally excludes Mycenaean Greece with the exception of three examples from Acarnania in Copenhagen Nat. Mus. (nn. 1324-5, 3158), four from Naxos in Copenhagen Nat. Mus. (nn. 3156-7), Mus. Polytech- nikum Athens and the British Museum, and another from Phylakopi, Melos (Buchholz 1959, 48, pl. 9, á; 48-9 pl. 10 e-f, 1J, a), so combining into an odd distribution pattern. It seems worth analysing the problem of a possible provenance of the Cretan double-axe to Cyprus and from Cyprus to Sardinia. The double-axes of the types discussed above (Fig. 8, 1-2) are not the only shape of the kind documented in Sardinia; a wide range of instruments is known with double working edges, round shaft-hole with collared socket protruding upon one side, always the same as that of the blades, and rhomboid profile: 1. The double- axes with vertical and converging blades (Fig. 8, 3). 2. The big picks with long curving arms (Fig. 8, 5). 3. The axe-adzes (Fig. 8, 4). The first class of tools is totally unknown outside Sardinia19 where it seems to be a local evolution of the former types of double-axes; the same can be said of the picks, whose shape appears to be not entirely independent from the Cypriot double- axes, but whose dimensions and functions are different; a comparison can be suggested between Sardinian and Cypriot axe-adzes, though these last show a tubular socket forming one piece with the vertical blade, while the other runs either from the bottom or from the middle of the socket, giving, as a whole, the idea of a 19A vague reference can be made to Deshayes type C2 represented only by one fragment from Cyprus with round hole but without collared socket (Gjerstad 1926, 231, type 8; Deshayes 1960, 259, 2083).</page><page sequence="21">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 21 Fig. 8.

The double-axes with vertical blades, the big picks and the axe-adzes have in common with the similar Cypriot tools the round shaft-hole and the protruding socket on one face only: it can be suggested that this local and homogeneous Sardinian production developed under general Cypriot influence but without direct imitation. VI. SMITHING TOOLS (a) HAMMERS Different types of hammer have been found in Italy, in Sicily and in Sardinia and they can be compared wih Cypriot and Aegean examples. The sledgehammers, extremely solid and heavy, widely used, as suggested by Catling, for works like cutting ingots, are represented only in Cyprus and in Sardinia; the small double-hammers (raising hammers), possibly suitable for working bronze vessels, are known from Cyprus, Greece, Crete, Italy, Sicily and from Sardinia. Again a distinctive feature seems to be the shaft-hole, round in the Cypriot and Sardinian hammers, oval, square and rectangular in the Aegean, Italian and Sicilian ones. In the present work, we leave aside all the asymmetric shapes21 and, among the symmetric ones, the Surbo, Montagnana and Morgantina hammers, whose affinity with Aegean tools is not in doubt, dealing instead with the Sardinian examples which show striking Cypriot affinities (Macnamara 1970, 248-9; Harding 1975, 194-5; De Min, Bietti Sestieri 1979, 212 fig. 5; Allen 1970, pl. 94, fig. 19).

Fig. 7, 7. The double axe no. 15 (Type 1 d) from Chiaramonti (see supra, p. 16), has long been in use as a sledgehammer judging from its striking ends. 20Deshayes 1960, 288 stresses the similarity between the Sardinian axe-adzes and the Danubian examples, suggesting as a possible explanation the long life of his C3 type; see also Schaeffer 1952, 55. 2ISee Casalecchio (Montelius 1895-1905, pl. 30, 8); Mottola (Müller-Karpe 1959, pl. 12, 5); Manciano (Peroni 1962, 1 1, 1, 5 (3) n. 52); Piediluco-Contigliano (Ponzi Bonomi 1970, 128-30, nn. 95-6, fig. 12, 6-7).</page><page sequence="23">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 23 Type II. Double-hammer, elongated rectangular shape, round shaft-hole. 3. Perfugas (Sassari); 13 cm. Mus. Cagliari; inv. 31348; Lovisato Coll., bought 1907, June 30th (Lo Schiavo, 1981b, fig. p. 280; 182, fig. 8; 1984, pl. II, 3). Fig. 7, 8. The hammer no. 1 is almost identical, as is the size, to the one from the Mathiati hoard (Catling 164, pl. lib), and to the hammer carved in a stone mould from Enkomi (Catling 1964, pl. 50 h), only it has a slightly oval shaft-hole, instead of a fully round one. The hammer from the Enkomi Foundry Hoard (Catling 1964, pl. 1 la) is bigger than the Sardinian examples, but the double-axe used as a hammer from Chiaramonti is much bigger. Different dimensions show a few bronze picks with broken arms, once used as hammers. Catling's hypothesis about the existence of similar immensely solid wooden mallets bound with metal sheets (Catling 1964, 99, n. 5), would explain the scarcity of tools of that size, whose shape and weight should vary, depending upon the function required; Deshayes recalls the persistant use of stone hammers (Deshayes 1960, 295-6)./ The double-hammer from Perfugas is similar in shape and size to the one from the Enkomi Foundry Hoard (Catling 1964, pl. lie) but it has almost double thickness; from this point of view, and apart from the oval hole, the Surbo hammers are very close to the Cypriot example. The chronology of Mathiati and of the Enkomi Foundry Hoards is within the twelfth century b.c.; the Sardinian hammers are sporadic finds. (b) TONGS To L. Vagnetti (1985) is due a typology of this big smithing tool; the 'Aegean' type, with a central loop and diverging blades, is represented at Crete (Nerokourou, Mallia, Zakro, Psira) and at Kos; the 'Levantine' type, with central loop, broad, marked shoulders and parallel blades, has been found in the Near East (Megiddo, Ras Shamra, Akko, Lachish). In Cyprus both types are documented earlier than the Cypriot Iron Age: the 'Aegean' type at Ayia Irini, t. 21 (Late Cypriot I A/B) (Pecorella 1977, 193, fig. 425, 195; 494) and in another example of unknown provenance (Karageorghis 1970, 201, fig. 16 a-b); the 'Levantine' type in the Enkomi Foundry Hoard (thirteenth century b.c.) (Catling 1964, 99, fig. 11, 4, pl. 10 a), and in the Sinda hoard (beginning of the eleventh century b.c.) (Karageorghis 1973, pl. VIII, fig. 2, 5). A pair of tongs of unknown provenance, with a central loop and diverging blades but with slightly marked shoulders may be an intermediate type between the two (Catling 1964, 99, fig. 11, 5, pl. 10 b). The blade of a pair of tongs in the Cape Gelidonya cargo can possibly be referred to the 'Levantine' type, where sometimes the bent and rounded ends of the blades are converging and almost touching (see Sardinian examples nos. 2 and 4) (Bass 1967, 109, B 187, fig. 116-17, 'Spit'). In the West, large bronze tongs are known only in Sardinia, all of them of 'Levantine' type with broad, marked shoulders;22 four of these tools (nos. 3-6) have 22Instead, the orientalising pair of tongs from Vetulonia, Circolo del Tritone, are very similar to the 'intermediate5 type mentioned above (Falchi 1900, 480, fig. 12; Montelius 1895-1905, pl. 179, n. 11).</page><page sequence="24">24 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI a ring under the loop, instead of the Cypriot cast collar, a parallel device to provide elasticity. As a whole, the tool could not have been cast in its actual shape, but as a rod, and then bent and cold hammered after casting. Five pairs of tongs (nos. 1-5) are large (42-5 cm. to about 30 cm.), smaller than the Cypriot examples (55 cm.). The sixth (no. 6) reaches only 25 cm. and it has been suggested it was used as a functional tool in the making of small bronze objects, like the bracelets, whose local production in the nuragic village of Serra Orrios has been documented (Lo Schiavo 1980 b, 146). 1.

The introduction of the 'Levantine' type in Cyprus dates apparently to the twelfth century b.c., much later than the 'Aegean' type in the tomb of Ayia Irini of Late Cypriot 1 A/B; consequently the dating of Sardinian tongs must follow that of the examples of Late Cypriot III, not having themselves enough chronological reference and associations. In fact, the tongs from Sassari, Badde Ulumu (no. 3) were found during the road excavations in January 1948, together with an extraordinary vessel cast in bronze with typical nuragic handle attachments, but it cannot be considered a close association. The little pair of tongs from Serra Orrios came from between the two nuragic huts nos. 42 and 43 in 1936, but Ahe stratigraphic position is unknown. More interesting, but still needing evaluation is the recent discovery during the 1984 excavation, of the fragments of tongs in the central tower of Nuraghe Santu Antine of Torralba.23 (c) CHARCOAL-SHOVELS These charcoal-shovels are another type of smithing tool known only, in the size and shape suitable for forge work, in Cyprus and in Sardinia. Catling mentions a close parallel to the Cypriot examples at Megiddo stratum Vila and at Beth Shemesh, but none of the kind has been found in the Aegean (Catling 1964, 101). In Cyprus there is one type of charcoal-shovel, with'a long twisted handle with a bird's head terminal and a square-sided blade with the four corners pinched together: usually the tool is cast in one piece, with the handle twisted after casting; in other cases, according to Catling, the handle is riveted to the blade. The three examples from the Enkomi Foundry Hoard (Catling 1964, 101, pl. 10, c-e), the two from an unknown provenance (Catling 1964, 101, nos. 5-6, pl. 10 g), and the one from Sinda (Karageorghis 1973, 75, 4, pl. 8, fig. 1, 4) are in one piece, as is the charcoal-shovel found at Hala Sultan Tekke, with a crucible, in a room with ashes in a corner (Obrink 1979, 5, 44 and 47, fig. 208; Àstròm 1982, 178, 8, 3). The only example with rivets for the handle at one side of the blade comes from the Enkomi Gunnis Hoard (Catling, 1964, 101, no. 4, fig. 11, 6, pl. 10 f).24 Catling lists also 'a survivor' in a Cypro-Geometric III tomb in Amathus, but he prefers to think of a continuity in use throughout the Iron Age for the shovel from Vouni. The best preserved Sardinian example from a private collection in Oristano (no. 1) is absolutely identical to the Cypriot charcoal-shovels: it is made in one piece with a long twisted handle, ending in a rough bird's head and a blade, partly damaged but with 'the distinctive scalloping of the back wall' (Catling 1964, 100); even the dimensions are the same as the bigger one from Enkomi (52-3 cm.). It is "Published here through the courtesy of the excavators Giudo Rossi and Susanna Bafico; the preliminary publication of the results of the excavations is in preparation. 24Being the only example of the type it can also be suggested to be a possible ancient restoration.</page><page sequence="26">26 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI highly probable, if not certain, that we are here dealing with a Gypriot import to Sardinia, perhaps together with the tripod-stand in the same collection (see infra, p. 36). The fragment of charcoal-shovel from Oliena, Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros is too small to allow a similar hypothesis, but it must be observed that the proportions, the angular profile of the blade are, again, identical.

The chronology of the charcoal-shovel no. 1 cannot be different from the pieces in the Enkomi Foundry Hoard and from Sinda, within the twelfth and to the beginning of the eleventh century b.c.; the same date is plausible also for the fragment from Carros, if it is also an import. It is more difficult to suggest a date for the Irgoli mould, which is without any dating association. (d) SHOVELS Five heavy shovels are known from Cyprus (two from the Gunnis Hoard and one each from the Stylianou Hoard, from Korovia Nitovikla and from an unknown provenance: Catling 1964, 79); one, similar to this last piece, is known from the Cape Gelidonya cargo (Bass 1967, 94, B 96). Catling defines them as agricultural tools, though the total absence in the Aegean and in the Near East of a comparable instrument seems strange. In the west, as well, shovels of such big size are totally unknown.25 The only Sardinian socketed shovel with oval blade, similar to the Cypriot examples for its shape but much inferior in size (17 cm), comes from an unknown site, and without association, in Sulcis, the mining district in the south of the island (Zervos 1954, fig. 162; Lo Schiavo 1981b, 280). It seems highly probable that it represents a smithing tool of practical use, namely a charcoal-shovel (Fig. 10, 4). Apparently it was made, like the Cypriot examples, cast flat in a one-piece mould and the socket rolled with the hammer.26 Concerning the smithing tools as a whole, there must be noticed the association of similar forms in Cyprus and in Sardinia, as opposed to the absence of similar toln Italy, small and apparently votive socketed shovels are known from the Late Bronze Age site of Frattesina and from Montagnana and Mandano hoards (Dizionari, pl. XCIII, 6-8; De Min, Bietti Sestieri 1979, fig. 5, 1); they all present a square-shaped blade. Oval, spoon-like decorated shovels, widely different from a solid and practical, either agricultural or smithing tool, are documented from many Protovillanovan sites of Northern Italy (Dizionari, pl. XCVII, 6-8, XCVIII, 1-3). 26 A socketed spatula is carved in a stone mould from Klavdhia, now in the British Museum, and a similar tool comes from Enkomi, Trésor de Bronzes (second half of the twelfth century b.c.). There seems to be no parallel for this tool either in the Aegean or in the Near East' (Catling 1964, 102, pl. 50c). The shape is also unknown in the west. In Sardinia, up to now, no socketed spatula is documented, but there is a striking similarity between the shape of the blade of Klavdhia spatula and a group of unfinished castings, still surrounded by flashes, from Monte Arrubiu hoard (Sarroch, Cagliari) (Taramelli 1926; Lo Schiavo 1984, pl. IV, 2-3). These six tools, when completed by cold hammering, could have been tanged spatulae. One of the castings could also have been a socketed spatula with a short rectangular blade, with the socket rolled up with the hammer. Clearly these suggestions cannot be conclusive.</page><page sequence="28">28 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI forms elsewhere. Sledgehammers, 'Levantine' tongs and charcoal-shovels are totally unknown in the Aegean and otherwise in the west; raising hammers and shovels are different from the examples known in Italy and in Greece; and in the Levant only 'Levantine' tongs and charcoal-shovels are documented. It seem difficult to suggest a contemporary independent invention of the complete set of smithing tools in the two islands, even based on the argument of the mining activity of both of them. The few but distinctive imports also stand against this interpretation of the archaeological data, stressing, on the contrary, the general framework of imports and influences from Cyprus to the west and mostly to Sardinia. VII. MIRRORS Bronze mirrors have been found yi Sicily (including the Aeolian islands) and in Sardinia. They belong to different iypes that have a perfect correspondence with the Aegean and Cypriot typology, as has been established by Catling (1964, 224-7). Type I. Tangless mirrors with rivet holes. 1.

Siracusa (Orsi 1912, 322; Peroni 1956, fig. 19). Fig. 11, 5. Fragments of mirrors of unknown type have been found at Lipari and Pantalica (Bernabò Brea, Cavalier 1980, 780, pl. 315, 283). All the examples quoted above are probably imports from the Aegean or from Cyprus. More precisely nos. 1-3 correspond very well to the widely known Aegean type with handle in perishable material (Blegen 1937, 350f; Iakovidis 1969-70, 285-6; Spyropoulos 1972, 132 ff.; Popham, Catling 1974, 230 f., fig. 19). This type is known in the Aegean possibly since Late Helladic/Late Minoan I and was certainly in use until the end of the Bronze Age. In Cyprus only one example of this type is known from Enkomi and has been considered as an import from the Aegean (Catling 1964, 224, pl. 40a). Type II, variant a is well known in Cyprus and appears also in Rhodes, possibly under Cypriot influence (Catling 1964, 224 f.). To this type can be ascribed no. 4 from Pantalica and nos. 5-6 from Sardinia. Type II, variant b seems to have a wide diffusion in Cyprus where some good examples have also come to light recently at Kition (Catling 1964, 224 f.; Karageorghis 1974, 90, pls. 85, 280, 332; 168, 280, 332). The two varieties belonging to type II have probably an Egyptian origin and could have reached Cyprus through Syria (Petrie 1927, 28 f, pls. 24-8; L. Astròm 1972, 562, n. 4). From a chronological point of view the tanged varieties in Cyprus can be dated to the thirteenth and to a part of the twelfth century b.c.; it is not possible to define a difference in chronology on the base of the tang type only. If we turn to the contexts of the mirrors found in Italy we can say that all the examples found at Pantalica belong to Pantalica I phase, the fragment from Lipari should not be later than the end of Ausonian I. The Sardinian examples are of more difficult chronology: in fact no. 6 is without context and no. 5 from Grotta Pirosu at Santadi belongs to a votive complex that encompasses a wide span of time. However, in consideration of the chronology proposed by E. Macnamara for the small tripod-stand found in the same cave and inspired by Cypriot prototypes, the mirror should be as early as the eleventh century b.c. (see infra, p. 42 and Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984). In Sardinia there is also another type of mirror that seems to be known only on the island. It is composed of an oval sheet with a short protruding tang; an openwork handle, usually decorated with cable pattern, is riveted to the tang. The</page><page sequence="30">30 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI best preserved examples belonging to this type has been found in nuraghe S. Pietro at Torpè. The chronology of this monument is in the Bronze Age, being characterised by ceramica a pettine^ however, the position of the mirror near the entrance, together with some later material of votive character, does not support a very early chronology.27 To sum up, we could say that mirrors were imported from the Aegean to Sicily, possibly as early as the end of the thirteenth century. Probably in the twelfth and the eleventh century b.c. tanged types of Cypriot derivation reached Sicily and Sardinia. This type of object had a further development in Sardinia at the transition between the Bronze and the Iron Ages.28 VIII. METAL VESSELS AND THEIR ATTACHMENTS Evidence for metal vessels in the West Mediterranean goes back to the Middle Bronze Age in Sicily (Thapsos culture). During the Late Bronze Age there is very little evidence for peninsular Italy and a great deal more for Sardinia, while Sicily seems to have none. Among the known examples several can be linked with Cyprus more convinc- ingly than to the Aegean, either as imports or as imitations. In the following paragraphs we shall examine separately the vessels and their attachments which can be considered as imports and the vessels and attachments which can be connected with Cypriot typologies, but probably produced in Italy. I. IMPORTED VESSELS Type I. Hemispherical bowl with a small swinging handle with rectangular attachment. 1. Caldare (Agrigento). Monte San Vincenzo. Found together with the basin with vertical handles no. 2 (see below), in a tomb of the Thapsos culture, diam. 24-6 cm. Mus. Siracusa (Orsi 1897, Vagnetti 1968).29 Fig. 12, 2. 27I thank F. Lo Schiavo for this communication (excavations at Torpè are in progress). An oval mirror without handle of the Vallero Collection in Sassari Museum has no provenance. Handles belonging to mirrors of this type are also known from S. Vittoria di Serri, from Teti, Abini and from Collezione Cara. One must also note that this kind of handle is very similar to openwork handles belonging to dashers or to lone votive swords of late date (Lo Schiavo 1981, fig. 380). 28One must recall also the tanged mirror from Tarquinia (Selciatello, grave 77; Hencken 1968, 47, fig. 35b), dated to the first half of the ninth century b.c. Its handle is attached to the disc through three rivets in a way that recalls closely the Villanovan razors (Bianco Peroni 1979, pls. 11-12, type Vulci with two cutting edges). It is a puzzling object, apparently later than any of the mirrors considered above and earlier than first millennium Greek mirrors. Should we think of a second millennium Aegean or Cypriot influence preserved in Italy (via Sardinia?) up to the ninth century b.c. and reflected in an object with details that are unequivocally Villanovan? The small dimensions of mirror no. 6 might recall the miniature votive mirrors very often found at sanctuaries of the Archaic and Classical periods (e.g. from the Argive Heraeum, Waldstein 1905, 264- 6, pls. 92-5). The lack of information on the real provenance of mirror no. 6 must warn us to consider it as only a possible example of the group of mirrors discussed here. However, even if mirror no. 6 were of a late date, this would not nullify the general picture for the other mirrors. 29 A small bowl, very fragmentary and distorted but possibly belonging to the same type, was found in tomb 57 at Thapsos (Orsi 1895, 131, fig. 45). Fragments of a third hemispherical?) bowl have been found in the area of Monte Campanella near Milena in southern Sicily (La Rosa 1979, 9, pl. 14, 6).</page><page sequence="31">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 31 Fig. 12.

In order to make immediately clear to which of the two finds the single objects belong, the provenances Piediluco and Piediluco-Contigliano are adopted in the present study.</page><page sequence="32">32 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI The hemispherical bowl with a swinging handle has good parallels in the Near East (Radwan 1983, 317-21) and is known also in Cyprus since the thirteenth century b.c. In fact to this date can be assigned a handle from Enkomi, found in tomb 1394 (Courtois 1981, figs. 171, 3; 172, 7). This type of handle has a wide development in Cyprus at a later date (Karageorghis 1983, figs. 88, 10; 115, 37; 156, 7). The basin with vertical handles and its Cypriot affinities have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Vagnetti 1968; La Rosa 1979, 11-12; Matthàus 1980, 136). Although the two Sicilian examples display some minor differences from the Enkomi basin, their Cypriot connection seems sure.31 The date of this type of basin is well fixed in the thirteenth century b.c., as for the hemispherical bowl discussed above. The type of large bowl or cauldron with vertical ring handle is only known in Italy from two attachments in the Piediluco-Contigliano hoard. One of the handles is attached to a fragment of the vessel's body, unfortunately badly preserved and twisted out of shape. The present writer proposed an affinity of this form of vessel with a type of Aegean cauldron known in Crete and mainland Greece between the fourteenth and the twelfth century b.c. (Vagnetti 1974, 661-3). This connection has been denied by Matthàus (1980, 137), who sees a substantial difference in the shape of the rim and in the profile of the bronze sheet. The shape of the rim of Matthàus' types 7-8 (Matthàus 1980b, 108-21, pls. 10-12) is in fact different from the shape of the Piediluco-Contigliano specimen which is characterised by a thickened flat ridge, almost T-shaped. However, thickened rims of this kind are known in other types of Aegean and Cypriot vessels (Matthàus 1980b, pl. 1,3 and many other examples; Catling 1964, fig. 17; Karageorghis 1983, figs. 88, 1, 89, 3-5, 7-8, 139, 92). As far as the shape of the vessel is concerned the state of preservation of the Piediluco-Contigliano example does not allow one to judge beyond any doubt its original profile. In any case the parallel suggested by Matthàus (1980, 137) with the Adrano cauldrons of the Iron Age, seems unlikely, both for the shape of the vessel and the type of handle. Moreover, recent finds from Cyprus provide a good parallel for the handle type; in fact a small cauldron from tomb 49 at Palaepaphos-Skales, dated to Cypro-Geometric I (second half of the eleventh century b.c.), displays vertical ring handles with rectangular attachments very similar to the Piediluco- Contigliano handle. It is also worth noting that the chronology of the new Cypriot example fits well with the chronology of the other imported objects found in the same hoard (see, infra, p. 40). II. VESSEL ATTACHMENTS CONNECTED WITH CYPRIOT TYPES The material treated in this paragraph has the characteristic of being almost certainly all of Sardinian manufacture under Cypriot influence, although some examples have been found in peninsular Italy. Sicily at the moment seems to be excluded from this distribution. 3IThe Cypriot examples (Catling 1964, 153, fig. 17, 10) seem to represent a mixed type deriving from the basin with vertical handles of Aegean type and the shallow bowl with stepped base very well known in the Near East and represented also in Cyprus (Matthàus 1982, fig. 9).</page><page sequence="33">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 33 Type I. Handle attachments of trefoil shape with spiral decoration. 1. Oliena. (Nuoro) Grotta Su Benticheddu; w. 4-8 cm. (attachment) Mus. Nuoro; inv. 25050. The attachment is fixed to the bowl by three rivets immediately under the rim. It seems to be made of coiled wire (Lo Schiavo 1978d, 89-91, pl. 28, 2). Fig. 13, 1. 2. Oliena.

Type II. Vessel attachment in the form of a figure-of-eight. 4. Dorgali. Serra Orrios (Nuoro). Nuragic village; w. 8-3 cm. Mus. Dorgali (Lo Schiavo 1980c, 147, pl. 41, 6). Fig. 13,9-10. The attachments of type I have good parallels in Cyprus where such a type is known from Enkomi (Catling 1964, fig: 17, 9; Matthàus 1982, 192, fig. 5) and Kouklia (Maier 1971, pl. 19); both the Cypriot examples are cast and can be dated between the end of the thirteenth and the twelfth century b.c. A third example from Ugarit, dated before 1200 b.c. is made of coiled wire (Matthàus 1982, fig. 6). The basic difference between the Cypriot and the Sardinian examples is the position of the loop for the handle. In fact, the Cypriot attachments have a vertical ring above the vessel's rim, while those found in Italy have a loop perpendicular to the surface of the attachment. This difference is probably due to the vessel's shape. In fact, while the examples from Enkomi and Ugarit belong to a situla, the Sardinian examples carried a cirular moving handle as it is visible in the well preserved bowl from Grotta Su Benticheddu. The chronology of the western specimens cannot be defined with great precision. The context of the Su Benticheddu cave does not seem to be very early although it could still be within the end of the Bronze Age; the material from the nuragic village at Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros includes examples of the Bronze Age and of the Early Iron Age (Lo Schiavo 1976b). It seems likely that the origin of the type must be put in close chronological connection with the Cypriot prototypes, but it is not possible to fix a lower limit for its duration in use. To this type of handle-attachment several other attachments with spirals set in various patterns must be typologically connected. All of them can be considered as of Sardinian derivation. The first one is a type of handle attachment with moulding at the rim and the plate below formed of four discs with spiral decoration. They have two loops perpendicular to the surface of the attachment set between each pair of outer discs from which hangs a small swinging handle. The best example of this type of handle attachment is riveted to a cauldron of biconical shape from Cala Gonone, Dorgali (Guido 1963, pl. 58) (Fig. 13, 8 and pls. la and Io), a second example, in very bad state of preservation, is included in the San Francesco hoard, Bologna (Zannoni 1888, pl. 47 A, 4; Lo Schiavo 1981, pl. 61a-b) (Fig. 13, 7 and pl. Ic). An example formed of only two spirals with one perpendicular loop is part of the so-called Terni hoard, in Copenhagen National Museum (Fig. 13, 6). This hoard is probably the third part of the Piediluco hoard and must be dated, as the other two parts,</page><page sequence="34">34 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI Fig. 13.

A further type, made of a rectangluar plate with two perpendicular loops and a series of spirals hanging from it, is represented by one example from Forraxi Nioi (Lo Schiavo 1981, pl. 61c), that could be as late as the Iron Age (Fig. 13, 5). Although these varieties have no exact parallels in Cyprus one cannot omit mentioning two Levantine objects found at Byblos (Dunand 1954, 353, fig. 387) (Fig- 13, 2) and Hama (Fugmann 1958, fig. 268, 6, C, 84), that perhaps can be interpreted as handle attachments very similar to the Sardinian examples. Both the objects are made of coiled wire (as are the trefoil attachments of the Ugarit situla quoted above) and unfortunately cannot be dated with any precision. The handle attachment of type II from Serra Orrios is highly fragmentary and of difficult interpretation. However, in consideration of the disposition of the holes, F. Lo Schiavo (1984b) suggested the recognition of it as a handle with 'rope bridges' derived from a type known in Cyprus for a long time. The earliest examples have been found in Tombs 49 and 58 at Palaepaphos-Skales, both belonging to Cypro- Geometric I (Karageorghis 1983, figs. 88, 1; 115, 32). This type has a long survival in Cyprus and in the Aegean, where it existed with several variations until the Orientalising period (Chavane 1982, 31-6). The Serra Orrios specimen cannot be closely dated. Judging by the pottery and other metalwork, the village seems to have been in use in the late second and early first millennium b.c.33 IX. TRIPOD-STANDS The fundamental study of Late Cypriot III stands is that of Catling (1964, 190- 223).34 Other major works are those of Lamb (1929, 32-5); Benson (1960, 7-16); Bass (1967, 107-9) and Cross (1974, 16-56); all these studies are principally concerned with tripods and other stands from the East Mediterranean and Aegean areas. In recent years considerable new evidence has come to light in Italy, principally from Sardinia, with the discovery and discussion of the Oristano, Santadi and S. Maria in Paulis tripod-stands, so that there is now, in 1984, strong evidence that at least two and perhaps three true Late Cypriot III tripod-stands reached Italy in antiquity, one example before c. 900 b.c. It is now also possible to declare that such Late Cypriot III tripod-stands were copied by bronzesmiths in Sardinia, and that such Sardinian imitations of this Late Cypriot III bronze form, on present evidence, may as justifiably be dated within the span of the Late Cypriot III period, that is c. 1200-1050 b.c., or closely after that period, as at any later date. The writer has taken this opportunity to illustrate all the examples known to her of Late 32Copenhagen National Museum, inv. 8077-8175. The handle-attachment is inv. 8169. These bronzes were acquired in 1924 from Amedeo Riccardi of Orvieto, who said they had been found in a pozzo near Terni. See S. Dietz, Etruskernes Verden Nationalmuseet, Brede Exhibition May 20 1982, 43. Information kindly supplied by S. Dietz and H. Roberts; see Dietz and Roberts forthcoming. 33A late derivation and local version of this type of handle can be recognised in a handle with 'bridges' from Decimoputzu-Monte Sa Idda, in Cagliari Archaeological Museum (Lo Schiavo 1981, fig. 368). 34The nomenclature of the component parts of tripod-stands used in this article follows those of Catling 1964, fig. on p. 191.</page><page sequence="36">36 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI Cypriot III tripod-stands, which were probably imported to Italy in antiquity, as well as the Sardinian imitations, and to mention some possibly relevant objects from other regions of Italy.35 I. IMPORTED LATE GYPRIOT III TRIPOD-STANDS 1. Tripod-stand of unknown provenance, now in a Private Collection at Oristano Fig. 14, 1; Reconstruction Fig. 14, 2; PL Ha. Though the precise provenance of this small tripod-stand is not known, there seems little doubt that it was found in Sardinia, and its broken state makes it most unlikely that it is a modern import, destined for the market of antiquities. The tripod-stand has already been described by F. Lo Schiavo (1983, 1 7 and Fig. on 15; 1984 forthcoming).36 Since not all readers may have access to Lo Schiavo's description' and discussion of this example, the most important points are again noted here. The Oristano tripod-stand is now broken into four fragments, which though twisted out of shape, nevertheless all once joined, and with the exception of any pendants once suspended from the pendant loops, together form a complete tripod-stand. These four fragments consist of (a) a small part of the ring with the remains of two outer struts; (b) one leg with part of its adjacent outer and inner struts and ring; (c) two legs, their adjacent outer struts, part of each adjacent inner strut and part of the ring, now fractured; (d) the inner ring with part of the three inner struts. On assembling this tripod -stand (Fig. 14, 2), the estimated original max. h. is 12-7 cm. and the estimated diam. of the ring some 12 to 13 cm. Though detailed measurements are not now possible, the reconstructed drawing is as accurate as may be achieved. No analysis of the metal is yet available. Like all tripod-stands, this miniature was designed to support a bowl or other vessel but the function of such assemblages is not yet clear. The supportive ring rises vertically from the junctions with the legs, and is made up of an upper and a lower 'double-bar', connected by diagonal supports, which form a zig-zag pattern. Each of these 'double-bars' may best be explained as first having been modelled in a single piece of wax, then grooved upon the outer and inner surfaces, although neither fully nor even really rounded, in order to give the appearance of two 'bars'. There is no decoration upon the surface of these 'double-bars'. The diagonal support in the zone of the ring is not formed of a continuous strip, but rather is made up of short lengths, which may best be explained as first having been separately modelled in wax, and then pressed or attached to the continuous 'false double-bars' above and below. The writer saw no discernible manufacturing join in the bronze of the circumference of the ring. The three legs are of composite type, being made up of a thicker middle section, which is flanked by two clearly defined outer ribs. At the base, the three elements are united to form out- turning feet of little definition, being neither modelled to resemble hooves nor circular. At the top, the middle section of each leg is directly united to the ring, there being no spacer, while the two outer ribs continue and turn outwards to form volutes of some three to four coils each; these volutes are also directly united with the ring. The different elements of the legs cannot have been separately cast in bronze and subsequently joined; moreover, though the volutes are clearly defined on the outer side, on the inner face they are sometimes distinct and sometimes virtually indefinable; it is also worthy of note that the small triangular spaces between the volutes, the middle section of the legs and the ring are sometimes àjour and sometimes filled with bronze. The writer believes that the manufacture of these composite legs may best be explained as first having been modelled in three separate pieces or bars of wax: these wax pieces were subsequently joined, being totally fused at the feet but with their separate definition preserved along the length of the 35I wish to express my deep gratitude to Fulvia Lo Schiavo and Lucia Vagnetti for reading and greatly improving this script. 36I am grateful to Fulvia Lo Schiavo for her generosity in allowing me to discuss this piece and her good offices in providing both drawings and photographs, as well as arranging for me to examine this tripod-stand.

Outer struts rise from each side of the legs at a point somewhat below half-way up their height; these outer struts rise diagonally to the ring, then bend and join the adjacent leg. Below the point at which they join the ring, in each case at the half-way point between the legs, there are set pendant loops; though no examples survive these loops would once have held pendants. Branching out from the same point on the legs, there also spring inner struts, which continue inwards to join and support the inner, circular ring; at the points of junction of the inner struts and inner ring are set the stylised forms of three birds. The writer believes that the outer struts, pendant loops, inner struts, inner ring and the birds would first have been modelled in wax and then pressed or attached to the adjacent parts. It is probable that this miniature tripod -stand was cast whole by the investment or lost- wax technique: that is, the craftsman first would have modelled in wax all the necessary elements of the whole, in the manner set out above, then joined them together, probably laying them upon a flat surface before composing them into a three-dimensional form, subsequently investing the completed wax model, and casting the Whole by the lost- wax process.37 Analysis of the metal at the junctions of the major component parts would demonstrate if any solder is present. The Oristano tripod-stand belongs to Catling's Group A Rod Tripod of II or III type; that is, though the ring, and indeed the whole object, was probably cast and thus should belong to Group A III with cast rings, nevertheless the ring has the appearance of being composed of several bronze parts, and thus might be included in Group A II type with composite rings. Though Catling suggested that several component parts of his Group A Rod Tripods, that is the rings of Group A II type, or parts of these rings, the legs and struts were first cast in bronze and then joined together, probably by hard soldering (brazing), or perhaps by casting-on, he also noted that some elements such as the three-dimensional animal protomes must have been cast by the lost- wax process, as were the rings 'of Group A Rod Tripod III type, and parts, if not the whole, of Group B Cast Tripods (Catling 1964, 190 and passim in the following pages) . The writer believes that the investment or lost- wax process was more widely used in the manufacture of Group A Rod Tripods, or at least those of miniature size;38 if this hypothesis is correct, the technique of the Oristano tripod- stand, as proposed above, does not alienate it from other examples of Group A II type. The principal typological affinities of the Oristano tripod-stand with others of Group A II or III types may be summed up as follows: the small size and robust character recall several of these Late Cypriot III tripod-stands and the general proportions, together with the straight legs designed to stand more-or-less upright with the ring rising vertically above them, unquestionably place this example, even if it is cast whole, within Group A Rod Tripods. The construction of the Oristano example with 'composite' ring and legs, outer struts, pendant loops, and inner struts and ring is a constant feature of Group A Rod Tripods. The poor craftmanship of 37For a rather similar description for the manufacture of the S. Maria tripod-stand and plaques, see Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 3 and 8. 38The writer has examined Catling 1964, no. 4, a miniature Group A Rod Tripod II type, now in Florence, and believes at least the ring and perhaps the whole was cast by the investment or lost-wax process.</page><page sequence="39">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 39 the Oristano tripod-stand may find analogies within Group A, and it may be that this lack of skill among the Late Cypriot III bronzesmiths indicates a late date. Among the Group A Rod Tripods of II or III type, double or 'false-double' 'bars' set at the edges of the ring are attested on Catling's no. 5 from Episkopi (1964, pl. 27e) and on an example recently found in Cyprus (Karageorghis 1971, 344 and fig. 23), as well as on the ring of a four-sided stand from Enkomi, Catling's no. 32 (1964, pl. 33c). However, double or triple 'bars' set at the borders of such rings, and often opposed to upper or lower 'bars' of a differing number, are common in the whole Late Cypriot III series of stands (e.g. Catling 1964, nos. 5, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33 and 34). Allied with a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif in the zone of the ring, such double or triple 'bars' are more common in Group B Cast Tripods (Catling 1964, nos. 24 and 25) than those of Group A, and the only Group A example known to the writer is that of the tripod-stand recently found in Cyprus (Karageorghis 1971, 344 and fig. 23); however, this example has 4 spacer, lacks volutes and an inner ring, and has opposed diagonal lines upon the 'double bars' bordering the ring. Such debased opposed cable or herring-bone patterning, so often present on Group A Rod Tripods and also known on four-sided stands, though absent from Group B Cast Tripods, does not appear on the Oristano example.39 Again within Catling's Group A Rod Tripods, but divided between Group A II ancLmuch more evidently in the Group A III form, defined as having cast rings, are examples of Rod Tripods with a composite type of leg, the outer ribs of which continue to form coiled volutes, and with no spacer. Among these Rod Tripods are Catling's no. 7, included in his Group A II type, from the Foundry Hoard at Enkomi (1964, pl. 28f), and of his Group A III type, no. 13 from Beth Shan (1964, pl. 29b) and no. 18 from Knossos (1964, pl. 30e), none of which has spacers. To these examples may be added the tripod-stand from Tomb 58, Palaepaphos-Skales (Karageorghis 1983, fig. CXV, 31). The examples from Enkomi and Beth Shan come from contexts dated to the twelfth century b.c., that from Palaepaphos from a tomb placed in the second half of the eleventh century b.c., and the context of Catling's no. 18 from Knossos may be as late as the proto-Geometrie period. However, none of these tripod-stands, apart from Catling's no. 18 from Knossos, which measures some 16-5 cm. in height, is of real miniature size, nor do any have a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif in the zone of the ring, though they do have inner struts and rings. It may be that the Beth Shan tripod-stand once had decorative elements set upon the inner ring (see Catling 1964, pl. 29b), but to date the Oristano example is unique in having birds perched near the junctions of the inner struts and ring. It is worthy of note that birds, modelled with open or shut wings, appear as pendants on the tripod-stand from Tiryns, Catling's no. 10 (1964, pl. 28b), a bird is set just below the junction of the ring and leg on the Piediluco-Contigliano fragment of a Late Cypriot III tripod-stand to be discussed below, and that three-dimensional birds appear on Late Cypriot III four-sided wheeled stands (Catling 1964, nos. 35 and 36). It may well be that such plastic motifs on the Late Cypriot III stands sometimes reflect the design of the vessels once 39It is worthy of note here that such cable patterning does appear on the Sardinian imitations of Late Cypriot III tripod-stands.</page><page sequence="40">40 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI associateci with them. Such a relationship between tripods and other stands and their associated vessels is well attested in later periods.40 In 1964, Catling suggested that at least some of the Group A Rod Tripods and Group B Cast Tripods were made at the same time but in different workshops (Catling 1964, 222). It still seems impossible to suggest any general priority between the groups; and indeed their many resemblances, together with those they share with the four-sided and wheeled stands, make it certain that their manufacture overlaps in time. Nor does it seem possible to place the individual examples, with all their complex details, of each group within a coherent typological series, though some details and a general lack of skill may indicate a date of manufacture late in the series, probably within the eleventh century b.c. With these considerations in mind, and whatever the final verdict may be upon the method of manufacture of the Late Cypriot III stands, it may be suggested that the Oristano example resembles in some ways both the larger and miniature tripod-stands of Group A Rod Tripods of both II and III types, and though to a much lesser extent Group B Cast Tripods. Among the closest analogies to the Oristano tripod-stand, though both have several differences, are Catling's no. 4, a miniature tripod-stand of Group A Rod Tripod II type of unknown provenance and now in Florence (Catling 1964, pl. 27f) and Catling's no. 1 1 of Group A III type, a small tripod-stand from a tomb near Episkopi, dated to the years after 1050 b.c., now in Pennsylvania (Catling 1964, pl. 29a). The former is chiefly similar in having a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif in the zone of the ring and in lacking cable patterning; the latter, though it has a cast ring with opposed diagonal lines forming a debased cable patterning and legs without composite form, nevertheless is of a similar size, proportion and stance to the Oristano example, and shares with it the poor technique, the lack of a spacer and the form of outer struts, pendant loops and inner struts and ring. It is of interest that this tripod-stand from Episkopi also seems to the writer to the closest analogy to the fragments of a tripod-stand from the Piediluco-Contigliano hoard, to be discussed below. It is extremely interesting that in the same private collection at Oristano as the tripod-stand are a double-axe, no. 13 {supra p. 16), tongs, no. 4 {supra p. 24) and a shovel, no. 1, perhaps a Late Cypriot III import to Sardinia {supra p. 27), and it is only reasonable to suppose these bronzes were all found at the same site and constitute a complex. 2. Fragments of a tripod-stand from the Piediluco-Contigliano Hoard {Terni) Fig. 14, 4 and 5; Pis. 116 and lie. Though separated in the literature and in different Museums, there can be no doubt that these fragments once formed part of a single miniature tripod-stand, firm evidence for the original unity of the so-called Piediluco and Contigliano groups.30 It is also probable that a number of bronzes from 'Terni', now in the National Museum of Copenhagen, once formed part of this large founder's hoard.32 These fragments have already been described (Catling 1964, 223. Piediluco, Mus. Pigorini, Rome, inv. 17788, Leopold 1939, fig. 2, 2; Müller-Karpe 1959, 74 and fig. 5. ^E.g. the tripod-stands decorated with the protomes of bulls or griffins of the Orientalising period, which reflect the embellishments on their associated cauldrons.</page><page sequence="41">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 41 Piediluco-Contigliano, Arch. Mus. Perugia, Ponzi Bonomi 1970, no. 116 and figs. 14, 7 and 15; Vagnetti 1974, 658 and fig. 1), but it will be clearest if a brief summary is given here. The workmanship of this tripod-stand is very poor and close comparison of measurements or other details is thus rendered impossible. The ring, some 3 cm. in width, rises more or less vertically from the legs and is made up of well defined upper and lower border 'bars', which are undecorated, and the intermediary zone, which is smooth on the inner side but on the outer face is divided into four 'bars', each pair decorated with opposed diagonal lines to form a very debased cable or herring-bone patterning. There appears to be no spacer, the legs are plain with a D- shaped section; the volutes, which are flat in the inner side, are very eccentric, with one on the Piediluco fragment resembling a four-spoked wheel. On the Piediluco-Contigliano fragment, set on the outer side of the leg just below the junction with the ring, there is perched a roughly modelled bird; a trace of the base for a similar bird may be seen on the Piediluco fragment. There can be no doubt that the ring of this miniature tripod-stand was cast, and probably together with the volutes and legs. No analysis of the metal is yet available, but such analysis at the junctions between the ring and legs would demonstrate if any solder is present. Like» the Oristano example, discussed above, the tripod-stand represented by the Piediluco-Contigliano fragments is an imported Late Cypriot III piece, and belongs to Catling's Group A Rod Tripods III type with cast rings. The fragmen- tary character of these pieces permits no observations concerning the general proportions of this example but it may be noted that the combination of a cast ring of 'composite' appearance, decorated with a debased cable patterning, with a plain leg and volutes with no spacer is rare. Indeed the only example known to the writer is Catling's no. 11, the miniature from a tomb near Episkopi, dated to the years after 1050 b.c. (Catling 1964, pl. 29a), which has already been mentioned as an analogy to the Oristano tripod-stand. Like the Piediluco example, the tripod-stand from Episkopi has well defined, plain 'bars' bordering the «ring; the zone of the ring has opposed diagonal decoration , which forms a debased cable pattern; the legs are plain and there are volutes with no spacers. Only the eccentric wheel-volute and the bird on the Piediluco-Contigliano fragments differ profoundly; it may be of interest that birds appear on two of the Late Cypriot III tripod-stands which reached the west Mediterranean. The Piediluco hoard is usually dated to c. 900 b.c., or perhaps somewhat later (see Ponzi Bonomi 1970, 152-3; Vagnetti 1974, 657). It is very possible that the true Late Cypriot III tripod-stand represented by the Piediluco-Contigliano fragments reached the lower Tiber Valley via Sardinia, later to be broken and included in a founder's hoard. Several west Mediterranean elements, also known in Sardinia, as well as some Sardinian bronzes reached west central Italy at a time broadly contemporary with the Piediluco hoard (Bietti Sestieri 1981, 241-2), and the presence of a handle attachment, mentioned above {supra p. 33) and probably of Sardinian manufacture, among the bronzes of the 'Terni' group now in the National Museum of Copenhagen, also supports this view. Here it is also relevant to note the other bronze fragments from the Piediluco hoard, which are Late Cypriot III imports or have strong Cypriot affinities; they are the vertical ring handles, which once would have been attached to bowls or cauldrons {supra p. 31), a cast, four- spoked wheel of miniature size, which may once have belonged to a wheeled stand (Ponzi Bonomi 1970, no. 1 10, figs. 14, 8 and 13, 2; Vagnetti 1974, 660 and fig. 2) and which may be compared with an example from Cyprus of twelfth-century date</page><page sequence="42">42 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI (RDAC 1979, 203 and pls. XXV-XXVII). It may be worthy of note that, if the Piediluco-Contigliano miniature wheel did once belong to a wheeled stand, such a stand would probably have had panels including figures (see Catling 1964, nos. 35 and 36). It is also possible that a small sword or dirk from the Piediluco-Contigliano group (Ponzi Bonomi 1970, no. 31, figs. 6, 2 and 7, 2) has Cypriot affinities. 3. Ring from the Samugheo Hoard (Nuoro) Fig. 14, 3. It is possible that a ring, made up of two border 'bars' joined by a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif in the zone between may once have formed part of a true Late Gypriot III stand (Vivanet 1890, 292; Taramelli 1903, 490 and Fig. 19). Unfortunately the present whereabouts of this hoard is not known and Taramelli gives no measurements, but he noted the fine quality of the piece, suggested that it was cast whole by the lost-wax process and interpreted the object as a braccialetto' \ It is impossible to tell from Taramelli's illustration whether this piece is more likely to be an import or a Sardinian imitation but its very simplicity may suggest the former; if this ring is of Cypriot manufacture, it might once have formed part of a tripod-stand or a four-sided stand (cf Catling 1964, nos. 4, 23, 24, 25, 33 and 34)41 which, judging by the scale at which the other objects from this hoard are illustrated by Taramelli, was probably of miniature size. It may be worth observing that, if this ring did once form part of a four-sided stand, such a stand might have had panels adorned with figures (see Catling 1964, nos. 33 and 34). The known bronzes from the Samugheo hoard, which Taramelli described as a founder's hoard, would suggest a date within the Italian Late Bronze Age. II. SARDINIAN IMITATIONS OF LATE GYPRIOT III TRIPOD-STANDS 1. Tripod-stand from Grotta Pirosu su Benatzu, Santadi {Cagliari) Fig. 15, 1 and PL THa. This small tripod-stand, now in Cagliari Museum,42 was found during 1968 in a cave with may other votive offerings. It has been fully described by Lilliu, who noted many precise comparisons, and only a short summary with some further observations need be offered here (Lilliu 1973 passim; Ridgway 1979-1980, 61 and fig. 8; Lo Schiavo 1982, 277 and pl. XXIII). The Santadi tripod-stand is complete, a condition no doubt owing to its robust character. It measures some 13 to 13-5 cm. in height, the diameter of the ring is c. 5-4 cm., and the width of the ring some 3-2 cm. Despite a fault in the casting of the upper circuit of the ring, the craftsmanship of this piece is excellent; the patina shows some difference between the lower legs and the rest of the tripod-stand, but this may well be due to the soil conditions in which it lay. No analysis of the metal is as yet available. The ring is ornate and, if it were not for the outward flare of the lower legs and feet, would give the tripod-stand a top-heavy appearance. The ring is made up of two superimposed circuits, each of which follows designs characteristic of Late Cypriot III tripods and other stands. The upper circuit is made up of three upper and two lower border 'bars', all without decoration, joined by a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif in the zone between; the distinct lower circuit is formed of two upper and four lower border 'bars', of which the bottom two are plain while the others are decorated with a crisp pattern of opposed diagonal lines to form a very debased cable or herring- bone patterning, while the zone is formed of 'double spirals'. The exterior face of the ring is finely modelled but the designs are ill defined upon the inner side. Set on the ring and just above the junctions with the legs are the heads of bulls; these heads are well modelled with protruding eyes, well defined ears and knobs on the tips of the horns. There is no discernible join in the bronze of the circumference of the ring. 41 See Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 9, where it is tentatively suggested that the S. Maria in Paulis plaques may have been designed to decorate a four-sided stand. wl am most grateful to Frotessor t . barreca tor permission to study tnis tripod-stand . i ne drawing is by F. S.

The short outer struts, somewhat oval in section, join the upper half of the legs to the ring; just below the point of junction between these struts and the ring is set a prominent spherical boss and below there is a pendant loop from which hangs a single joining link and a spherical pendant, whose surface is covered with dots resembling pin-heads. The suspension loop of these pendants were cast with the pendants and it is worthy of note that the connecting link has no discernible join in its circumference, so that it seems possible that the pendant, link and pendant loop with the tripod-stand were all cast together. This tripod-stand must have been cast by the investment or lost-wax process, either whole or with the upper circuit of the ring cast-on. Analysis of the metal at the junctions between the major component parts would demonstrate whether any solder is present. There can be no doubt that Lilliu in his brilliant discussion of the Santadi tripod-stand was correct in declaring it to be of Sardinian manufacture following Late Cypriot III prototypes of Catling's Group A Rod Tripod II or III form (Lilliu 1973&gt;, 287). Since, as has been stated above, the writer thinks that casting by the investment or lost-wax process was more widely used in the manufacture of Late Cypriot III examples than Catling believed in 1964, the technique of manufacture proposed above does not alienate the Santadi tripod-stand from the Cypriot examples. Some general and detailed observations may be made upon the Cypriot prototypes which inspired the craftsman in Sardinia, who created the Santadi tripod-stand. The stance, as well as the general proportions, of this piece, whether it was originally conceived with or without the upper circuit of the ring, more closely resemble the larger examples of Catling's Group A Rod Tripods than any miniature specimens. The upper circuit of the ring, with multiple, plain border 'bars' and a zig- zag motif in the zone between, recalls the ring of Catling's no. 4, which has no volutes (Catling 1964, pl. 27f), Catling's nos. 23, 24 and 25, all Group B Cast Tripods (Catling 1964, pls. 31e, 31f and 32a and b) as well as the rings of the four-sided stands, Catling's nos. 33 and 34 (Catling 1964, pls. 33d and 34). To these there may now be added a tripod-stand recently found in Cyprus, which has no volutes (Karageorghis 1971, 344 and fig. 23), the Oristano example discussed above (Fig. 14, 1 and PL Ila) and even the Samugheo ring (Fig. 14, 3). Of all these analogies, the closest is that of Catling's no. 25, a Group B Cast Tripod from a tomb at Amathus, dated to the end of the eleventh century b.c.; the ring of this tripod- stand also has three plain border 'bars' above, two plain border 'bars' below, and a zone with a wavy 'bar' or zig-zag motif. The lower circuit of the ring of the Santadi tripod-stand, with multiple border 'bars', two pairs of which are decorated with diagonal lines, and a series of 'double spirals' in the zone between, recalls the ring of Catling's no. 5 from Episkopi, which also has animal heads set on the legs (Catling 1964, pl. 27e), the rings of some four-sided and wheeled stands, Catling's nos. 31, 32 and 35 (1964, pls. 33a, b and c, pl. 36a), and the detached ring from a twelfth- century context at Myrtou, Catling's no. 41 (1964, pl. 36b). The crisp lines of the opposed diagonal motif, which must have been incised on the wax, recall those on the Piediluco-Contigliano fragments (Fig. 14, 4 and 5). The general decorative effect of this lower circuit resembles the ring of the S. Maria in Paulis tripod-stand, also of Sardinian manufacture and to be discussed below (Fig. 15, 2).</page><page sequence="45">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 45 All these details emphasise that the craftsman who made the Santadi tripod- stand was working closely within the Late Cypriot III tradition, but other points make it certain that this piece is of Sardinian manufacture. The lack of both volutes and spacers never occurs among Group A Rod Tripods and true Late Cypriot III tripod-stands never have two superimposed circuits in the ring; it may be worth noting that both these features seem reflected in a Cypriot terracotta tripod-stand, perhaps of Cypro-Geometric I date (see Catling 1964, 214 and pl. 38a). The placing of animal protomes on the ring is unique, the form of the legs and outer struts is eccentric, and the spherical bosses, which never appear on Cypriot examples, seem to be of Sardinian inspiration. The writer believes that the craftsman who made this miniature tripod-stand in Sardinia must have been aware of true Late Cypriot III Group A Rod Tripods, probably of both II and III types, and perhaps of the large as well as miniature versions and may well have seen a Group B Cast Tripod. The votive deposit of the Grotta Pirosu su Benatzu cannot be closely dated, but it is relevant to note that a mirror, no. 5 above {supra p. 31) was also found there; this mirror is probably imported and may date to the eleventh century b.c. 2. Tripod-stand with Bowl from Tomb 10, Bologna-Romagnoli PI. £Qò. It is possible that this miniature, found in a seventh-century grave at Bologna, is of Sardinian manufacture (Brizio 1893, 186 and fig. 10; // Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna 1982, 245). The small bronze takes the form of a tripod; the legs are plain, roundish in section, and drop vertically from the ring and then flare outwards to end in plain out- turned feet. At either side of the junctions of the legs with the ring are pendant loops, possibly ultimately recalling the Late Gypriot III volute motif, and from these loops hang pendants resembling acorns. The shallow bowl rests upon the ring; it is some 7 cm. in diam. and is strongly carinated; there are mouldings at both the rim and carination. The base has a deepening at the centre, which fits into the circuit of the ring; at the bottom of this central deepening there is a larger central hole and three smaller holes set round its rim. Two small fixed vertical handles of rounded form were once set at the rim of the bowl; these handles had spherical knobs placed on either side of their base. It is not clear whether this small bronze was cast in one or two parts. It is difficult not to believe that its form ultimately goes back to Late Cypriot III tradition and some elements recall Sardinian bronzework; the stance of the legs strongly resembles those of the Santadi tripod-stand and the small vertical ring handles with a spherical boss set either side of the base recall those on a cast bronze vessel, perhaps to be associated with the tongs, no. 3 (supra p. 23), from Sassari, Badde Ulumu. The seventh-century date of the tomb at Bologna, in which this small bronze was found, may seen to militate against the hypothesis that it is in fact an example of the longevity of the Late Cypriot III traditions sustained in Sardinia through several centuries. It is therefore relevant to note that the San Francesco hoard, which included objects of an even later date (see Carancini 1979) also has bronzes which, as has been suggested above, have a similar typological tradition. These bronzes are a double-axe, no. 12 (supra p. 16), a bronze handle attachment of trefoil shape, no. 3 (supra p. 33), and a handle attachment with mouldings at the rim and the plate below formed of four discs with spiral decoration (supra p. 33).</page><page sequence="46">46 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI 3. Tripod-standfrom Ittiri (Sassari), S. Maria in Paùlis Hoard Fig. 15, 2 and PL TELc. The 139 bronzes of the S. Maria in Paùlis hoard were bought by the Trustees of the British Museum from Signor G. Massaia of Sassari in 1926, and were said to have been excavated near Sassari in the previous year.43 The hoard was mentioned by von Bissing (1928, 87), and some of the bronzes were discussed and illustrated by Zervos (1954), Guido (1963) and Lilliu (1980). However, the entire group was not studied, nor the tripod-stand discussed and illustrated, until 1982, when the S. Maria in Paùlis hoard was the subject of a paper presented by David and Francesca Ridgway and the writer at the Sixth British Museum Classical Colloquium (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984). Thus the miniature tripod-stand has already been fully discussed by the writer but it is necessary here to repeat a short description and some observations, in order that the general thread of argument may be clear. The S. Maria tripod-stand (GR Reg. 1926. 5-11.2. Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 2-7, pl. II and fig. 2) reached the British Museum as seven fragments, a condition which reflects the fragile quality of the piece. The tripod-stand measures some 71 cm. in maximum height, the restored diameter of the ring is c. 11 -5 ¿to 12 cm. and the width of the ring some 3-5 cm., with a thickness of only 0-15 cm. The ring is ornate and made up of three bands with two superimposed zones set between. The two border and middle bands have the same patterning and each is composed of two plain outer ribbons and a middle ribbon, which is decorated with a series of diagonal lines to form a debased cable pattern. Between these three bands are two zones of 'false coils', that is the full 'coils' are marked upon the exterior surface only; the inner face of the ring, both of the bands and 'coils' is almost flat. The legs of this miniature rise at a slightly inclining angle from foot to ring; they are an irregular rectangle in section and decorated on the outer surface with three groups of three diagonal striations. Outer struts are recalled in short bars joining the plain feet to the ring near the junction with the legs; set in the triangular space thus formed and touching the ring, leg and outer strut are 'false coils' resembling volutes. It is probable that this small tripod-stand once had pendant loops set on the lower edge of the ring mid- way between each leg; only traces of these survive and all the pendants are missing. X-ray fluorescence analysis of the metal at the junctions of the component parts of this piece showed no solder was present; the composition of the bronze suggested it was made of copper mined and smelted in Sardinia (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 19-20). This brief description of the S. Maria tripod-stand may serve to demonstrate some of its technical and typological affinities. Like the Santadi example, it was probably cast whole by the investment or lost- wax technique (Macnamara, Ridg- way, Ridgway 1984, 3) and by a craftsman in Sardinia. Though fragmentary, the small piece of bronze from S. Vittoria di Serri, no. 4 below (Fig. 15, 3), is so like the ring of the S. Maria example that it is suggested it once formed part of a similar tripod-stand, perhaps made in the same workshop. The S. Maria tripoH-stand resembles the Santadi example in having two superimposed zones in the ring, a feature not known to occur among the true Cypriot stands; it is worthy of note that whereas the Santadi tripod-stand has two distinct circuits, both closely following Late Cypriot III types of ring, placed one above the other, in the S. Maria tripod- stand two zones form part of the design of the ring conceived as a whole, with the patterning of the border and middle bands and of the zones repeating. In this respect, the Santadi example may seem closer to the Late Cypriot III prototypes, with the S. Maria tripod-stand following a development of design, which took place in Sardinia. 43The bronzes are in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the British Museum, GR Reg. 1926. 5-11. 1 to 139. The drawing is by Susan Bird and the drawing and photograph are kindly supplied by the courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum.</page><page sequence="47">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 47 Nevertheless, the craftsman who made the S. Maria tripod-stand was working closely within the Late Cypriot III tradition and it has features which recall both Catling's Group A Rod Tripods and those of Group B Cast Tripods. The wide, low proportions of this piece undoubtedly recall Group B Cast Tripods more closely than' those of Group A; again the pendant loops attached directly to the ring mid- way between the legs are a common feature of Group B Cast Tripods (e.g. Catling 1964, nos. 25, 28, 29, pl. 32). However, the volute motif is characteristic of Group A Rod Tripods but lacking on those of Group B, though it is sometimes recalled on the design of the ring, the lack of inner struts or ring and the presence of replica outer struts, a feature very rare on Group B Cast Tripods, all point to a familiarity of the design of Group A Rod Tripods. Coils or spirals, double spirals and continuous spirals occur in the rings of both Group A and Group B Tripods, as well as on those of four-sided and wheeled stands; rings with a cable patterning set between, or alternating with, plain 'bars' often occur on Group A Rod Tripods (e.g. Catling 1964, nos. .7, 10, 11, 13). One of the closest analogies to the design of the ring of the S. Maria tripod-stand is that on the detached ring from a twelfth-century context at Myrtou, Catling's no. 41 (1964, pl. 36b). It therefore seems likely that the craftsman who made the S. Maria tripod- stand in Sardinia was aware of the design of true Late Cypriot III Group A Rod Tripods and Group B Cast Tripods; Cypriot hybrids of these groups are not yet known. It is also possible that he was influenced by Sardinian developments based upon these Cypriot traditions. Among the other bronzes included in the S. Maria hoard there are three nearly complete and the fragments of two further plaques; each has two zones of coils set within a rectangular frame. The general character of these plaques may recall Late Cypriot III traditions and it is just possible that, if they were designed to decorate a single object, this might have been a Sardinian derivation of a Cypriot four-sided stand (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 7-9, pls. Ill and IV, fig. 3). The double-axe, no. 16 [supra p. 16), also formed part of this hoard. The objects in the S. Maria hoard may span a considerable period of time; the hoard has been tentatively dated within the eleventh and tenth centuries b.c. (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 17-18). 4. Fragment of a tripod-stand from S. Vittoria di Serri (JVuoro) Fig. 15, 3. A small bronze fragment, now in Case 27 of Cagliari Museum, must once have formed part of the ring of a miniature tripod-stand very similar to that of the S. Maria hoard, described above (Lo Schiavo 1983, 18). This fragile piece measures only 2-9 x 1-9 cm.; there survives part of a band made up of two plain outer ribbons and a middle ribbon, which is decorated with a series of diagonal lines to form a debased cable pattern, and two 'false coils' are still attached to this band. The resemblance to the ring of the S. Maria tripod-stand is clear, and it seems likely that this fragment and the S. Maria example were made in the same workshop. F. Lo Schiavo (1983, 18) also drew attention to a small spherical bronze pendant from S. Vittoria di Serri, which might once have belonged to a small tripod-stand, and two other pendants of slightly larger size also come from the site (Fig. 15, 4a- c); these, too, are now in Cagliari Museum. It is relevant to note that other objects from this great sanctuary suggest an early date, mainly during the</page><page sequence="48">48 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI Italian Late Bronze Age from the twelfth century on (see Taramelli 1909, 1911, 1914, 1922b and 1931); these include part of a violin-bow leaf fibula similar to those of Late Helladic C date (Taramelli 1931, fig. 15a; Lo Schiavo 1978, 28 and fig. 2, 2), an amber knuckle-bone bead of Tiryns type (Taramelli 1922b, 321, fig. 47), and two small double-axes, nos. 18 and 19 {supra p. 18). Another tripod-stand, now lost, is said to have been found in Sardinia, perhaps at a site near Santadi (Lo Schiavo 1982, 278). A further bronze pendant was found in the area of the nuragic village of Costa Nighedda, Oliena (Nuoro) (Fig. 15, 5. Lo Schiavo 1983, 18), and Lo Schiavo compared a small length of bronze bar, some 21 x 1-3 cm. and decorated with opposed diagonal lines, from Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros, Oliena (Nuoro) (Fig. 15, 6. Lo Schiavo 1983, 18) with the legs of some Late Cypriot III stands. The general likeness between the Oliena fragment and, for example, the fragment probably from the leg of a tripod-stand from the Cape Gelidonya wreck (Bass 1967, B185, 108 and fig. 116) or that from the Enkomi Miniature Hoard (Catling 1964, tío. 45, pl. 36h) is evident; however, Lo Schiavo has also* remarked the likeness of the Oliena fragment to that of the suspension bar of a Sardinian miniature bronze boat (e.g. Kunst und Kultur Sardiniens 1980, no. 181). Such strong resemblances between Late Cypriot III and Sardinian bronzes emphasise the common character of their tradition. Other small pieces of bronze from Italy, which might once have formed part of tripods or other stands, should be mentioned here. There is a bronze pendant from Tomb 4 at S. Domenica di Ricadi, Calabria; this tomb also included glass paste beads and pottery similar to that of the Ausonian I period of the Lipari Islands (Ardovino 1977, 13-17 and fig. 3, 8; Vagnetti 1982b, 168-9). At the Third Italian Seminar, held at Cambridge in January 1984, G. Bergonzi mentioned a small bronze spiral from Pantalica, published as stratified in an Italian Late Bronze Age context (Orsi 1899, 79 and fig. 31), and suggested that it might once have formed part of a tripod or other stand.44 It is now necessary to sum up the evidence provided by the Late Cypriot III tripod-stands, which were certainly or in all probability imported to Italy in antiquity, and the Sardinian imitations. As the writer has stated elsewhere (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 5), until recently it has seemed possible to. accept Catling's hypothesis that true Late Cypriot HI tripods and other stands form a homogeneous group, made in Cyprus and, though the inspiration may rest in the Levant and go back to the thirteenth century b.c., the Cypriot examples are of twelfth or early eleventh-century date and ceased to be made about 1 100 b.c. or at the end of the Late Cypriot III period around 1050 b.c. (Catling 1964, 216-17). The later date, or perhaps even a little afterwards, may now seem preferable for the end of the manufacture of true Cypriot stands, for two more tripod-stands have been recently found in tombs in Cyprus dated either to the second half of the eleventh century b.c. or simply within Cypro-Geometric I, that is c. 1050 to 950 b.c.; these are 44 Also from Sicily but from a context of much later date, the Adranò hoard of the eighth or seventh century b.c., comes a bronze fragment which may be likened to the support of a Late Cypriot III offering-stand, or might be of Sardinian manufacture. See Müller-Karpe 1959, pl. 9, 8; Bartoloni and Delpino 1975, 43, note 178.</page><page sequence="49">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 49 the fine examples from Palaepaphos-Skales, Tombs 49 and 58 (Karageorghis 1983, fig. LXXXIX, 11 and fig. CXV, 3 1).45 It is also possible that the Cretan group of tripod-stands may have been made after the end of the Late Cypriot III period (Catling 1964, nos. 18, 19 and 20, pl. 30e and pl. 31a and b. See, too, an example from Thera, Aupert 1975, 684 and fig. 203); no doubt the design of the Cretan tripod-stands was inspired by Cypriot prototypes (cf. Catling 1964, no 17, pl. 30f from Enkomi or Karageorghis 1983, fig. CXV, 31 from Tomb 58 at Palaepaphos- Skales) but the writer believes they stand apart from the main Cypriot groups and may have been made in Crete. If this hypothesis is correct, it would be symptomatic of a process in which outstanding Late Cypriot III bronze forms or craftsmen, or both, reached areas peripheral to Cyprus, and that in some of these areas traditions of Late Cypriot bronzework survived, to emerge again at a later date (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 5). The typology of the tripod-stands and four-sided stands, including wheeled stands, makes it almost certain that this occurred in the Levant with its neighbouring regions (Cross 1974, 57-116), in Crete (see Catling 1964, 222; Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 25 note 40), and perhaps elsewhere in Greece (Catling 1980b, 93-7; see too, Popham, Touloupa, Sackett 1982, 171, where a set of bronze wheels is mentioned; Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 24 note 32). Thus true Late Cypriot III tripod and other stands, or fragments of such stands, which have been found in much later contexts - like that from a grave on the Pnyx at Athens, which is dated to the Geometric period (Catling 1964, no. 6), or the example of a Group B Cast Tripod from Olympia, which Catling suggested must have been dedicated as an antiquity (Catling 1964, 223), or the fragments from the Piediluco-Contigliano hoard, completed c. 900 b.c., or a little later - must all have been old at the time of their burial or dedication, or were broken and included in a founder's hoard. Nevertheless, derivatives of such Late Cypriot III types continued to be made in parts of the Mediterranean world reached by Late Cypriot III contacts. The above two hypotheses must form the background for the discussion of Late Cypriot III tripods or other stands, or fragments of such stands, known from Italy, and all the other related forms, also from Italy. Examples of Late Cypriot III stands reached Greece in the Mycenaean age (from Tiryns, Catling 1964, no. 10; from the Anthedon Hoard, Catling 1964, no. 43), and, though the chronology is not clear, it has been suggested above that such imports also reached Crete. As has been shown in this article, there is now very strong evidence that Late Cypriot III bronze objects were imported to Sardinia or copied there; some of these types did not survive the Cypriot Late Bronze Age, and often they are the equipment of workers of metal ores or bronzesmiths. Among these imported bronzes are firstly the Oristano tripod-stand, which it is only reasonable to suppose was found in Sardinia and once constituted a complex with a shovel, perhaps also a Late Cypriot III import, a double-axe and tongs, both with Late 45It is interesting to note the wealth of fine bronzework from these and contemporary tombs at this site. The bronzes of Tombs 49 and 58 included a small cauldron with vertical ring handles comparable to no. 5 above (supra p. 00) and vessels with attachments in the form of a figure-of-eight (supra p. 00).</page><page sequence="50">50 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI Cypriot III affinities; secondly, the PiedilucoContigliano fragments of a tripod- stand, which may well have reached west central Italy via Sardinia, and were found in a hoard which may be dated to c. 900 b.c., or a little later, and associated with vertical ring handles and a miniature wheel, all of which may have Late Cypriot III affinities; and thirdly, the Samugheo ring, perhaps an import, and from a Sardinian hoard of the Italian Late Bronze Age. Thus it is entirely possible, indeed probable, that the known imported examples of Late Cypriot III tripod or other stands reached Italy at an early date, that is during or a little after the floruit of these forms in Cyprus during the twelfth or eleventh centuries b.c. It is clear that Late Cypriot III tripod-stands were subsequently imitated in Sardinia, and in a closely related technique, as well as with a full familiarity with Late Cypriot III designs. There can be little doubt that the craftsmen in Sardinia who created the Santadi, S. Maria and S. Vittoria miniature tripod-stands were well aware of both the general design an¡d many details of Late Cypriot III tripod-stands of Catling's Group A Rod Tripods/perhaps both large and miniature examples, and Group B Cast Tripods; it is possible that contemporary craftsmen in Sardinia also knew of the design of Late Cypriot III four-sided, including wheeled, stands. In view of the evidence set out above - that is principally the probable date of arrival in Italy of true Late Cypriot III tripod-stands during the twelfth or eleventh centuries b.c. or a little later, the full familiarity with Late Cypriot III bronzework shown by the craftsmen in Sardinia who made imitations of Cypriot tripod-stands, and the possibility that Cypriot bronzeworkers reached Sardinia during the Italian Late Bronze Age - it is Very probable that the Sardinian imitations of Late Cypriot III tripod-stands were made at a period not very far removed from that of their prototypes. Though without well-dated contexts it is impossible to estimate how long Late Cypriot III traditions and typologies may have survived in Sardinia, the current evidence suggests that the Sardinian imitations of Late Cypriot III tripod- stands may as justifiably be dated within the floruit of the Late Cypriot III forms in Cyprus, or closely after that period, as at any later date. The contexts of the Santadi, S. Maria and S. Vittoria tripod-stands, or fragments of such stands, do not militate against this view; all have other finds which are certainly datable within the Italian Late Bronze Age. An alternative opinion, put forward by Lilliu in his study of the Santadi tripod-stand, should be included here (Lilliu 1973, passim). Though well aware of the complicated exchanges between the east Mediterranean area and Sardinia during the end of the second millennium b.c., and correctly defining the Santadi miniature as dependent upon Late Cypriot III prototypes, Lilliu nevertheless came to the conclusion that the Cypriot prototype for the Santadi miniature must have reached Sardinia during the colonising age, after the arrival of the Phoenicians. He therefore proposed a date for the manufacture of the Santadi tripod-stand during the late ninth or eighth centuries B.c., finding some confirmation for this dating in the evidence provided by the Piediluco- Contigliano hoard, dated to the ninth century b.c., and by the wheeled stand from Bisenzio of c. 700 b.c. (Lilliu 1973, 300-1). But, as has been suggested above, the fragments representing a true Late Cypriot III tripod-stand from the Piediluco-Contigliano hoard may have reached peninsular Italy via Sardinia and considerably before 900 b.c., so that they do not suggest Late Cypriot III imports, which reached Italy during the colonising age. It is known that true Late Cypriot III tripod-stands existed in Greece to be placed in a tomb of Geometric date (Catling 1964, no. 6) or to be dedicated at Olympia (Catling 1964, 223), but this evidence only provides termini ante quos for their arrival in Greece, and no Late Cypriot III survivals or imports from contexts of colonial date</page><page sequence="51">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 51 in Italy are known to the writer. As has been suggested above, tripods and other stands of Late Cypriot III tradition continued to be made in the east Mediterranean and Aegean areas during the early first millennium b.c., but it is extremely doubtful that, apart from Sardinia, any such tradition existed in Italy. Thus when the bronzesmiths of west central Italy began, in the eighth century b.c., to make hammered tripod-stands, ultimately dependant upon Late Cypriot III designs, it is likely that a new inspiration of the colonial age had provided a knowledge of the form; this inspiration may well have arisen from the importation of either a pottery or bronze prototype from Greece (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 6). A rather similar hypothesis may best explain the Bisenzio wheeled stand, which is unquestionably of Italian manufacture and c. 700 b.c. in date, though also ultimately derived from Late Cypriot III traditions (see Moretti and Maetzke 1970, 82 and pl. 84). It and the other contemporary Italian wheeled-stands (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 25 note 39) in all probability derive from Cretan or east Mediterranean prototypes of the colonial period, so they, too, do not suggest Late Cypriot III traditions arrived directly in Italy during the colonising age. Indeed when 'Rod' tripod-stands again appear in Italy during the seventh century b.c., they follow a typology which must ultimately depend upon Late Cypriot III designs, but these Orientalising tripod-stands have their more immediate prototypes in the Near East and the form passed west via Cyprus and the Aegean world.46 Thus the great longevity *of some Late Cypriot III bronzework traditions is demonstrated and resemblances between some Italian Iron Age forms and those of Late Bronze Age Cyprus do not necessarily imply that Late Cypriot III objects reached Italy in the colonising age. If the hypotheses that Late Cypriot III stands reached Italy towards the end of the second millennium b.c., and that they were subsequently imitated in Sardinia, perhaps during the eleventh or tenth centuries b.c., be correct, a most important deduction is that the bronzesmiths of Sardinia were masters of the art of casting bronze by the investment or lost-wax technique during the Italian Late Bronze Age. This possibility has serious implications for the study of the great series of Sardinian bronze figurines.47 X. FIGURINES As has been noted above, the evidence for the use and exchange of ox-hide ingots of the second millennium b.c. now spans the east and west Mediterranean areas from the Levant to Sardinia, and some bronze forms which reached Italy were held in common between the Levant and Cyprus during the Late Bronze Age of the east Mediterranean area; yet no second-millennium Levantine or Syro-Palestinian imports to Italy have yet been mentioned in this article.48 Though no conclusions will be attempted here, and with the current evidence it is probable that no such conclusions should yet be attempted, it is clearly necessary to review the present evidence of Syro-Palestinian figurines together with those showing Cypriot affinities 46The writer intends to return to this subject in a future article. 47Since this script was finalised, the writer has received H. W. Catling's article entitled 'Workshop and Heirloom: Prehistoric Bronze Stands in the East Mediterranean', which is published in the Report of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus 1984, 69-91. 48Here, the term Syro-Palestinian will be used for figurines made in the Levant before c. 1050 b.c. The name Phoenician will only be used to refer to the people or objects stemming from the Levant after c. 1050 b.c. When the name has been placed in parenthesis, i.e. 'Phoenician', the writer is quoting references where the name is used before c. 1050 b.c.</page><page sequence="52">52 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI of second-millennium date, which have been found in Italy; to estimate the possibility that they reached Italy in the late second millennium b.c.; to try to isolate any specifically Cypriot characteristics and most tentatively to indicate whether it seems possible or likely that 'pre-coloniaP imports to Italy49 from the east Mediterranean area, perhaps as early as the twelfth or eleventh centuries b.c., inspired or influenced the development of the great series of Sardinian bronze figurines. Much has been written concerning the imported and Sardinian bronze figurines and this is not the place to repeat the arguments in full. Rather a broad presentation of the present evidence is attempted here, with only the fundamental and some recent works mentioned and a few observations added. The whole subject is fraught with difficulties arising from the indecisive character or lack of evidence to date; this is clearly shown by the widely differing opinions currently expressed by scholars. The following headings should therefore be considered as tentative. I. IMPORTED SYRO-PALESTINIAN FIGURINES 1. Male figure in smiting pose , found in the sea off the south coast of Sicily, near Sciacca. This complete statuette was dredged up in the nets of fishermen from Sciacca, near Selinunte, in 1955 (Seeden 1980, no. 1811, see for many references; Bisi 1980, 7-8 and pl. II, 1; Tusa 1983, 512 and fig. 38). It is now in Palermo Arch. Mus. Though much corroded the figurine shows a fine craftsmanship; it is some 35-2 cm. in height and represents a striding male figure, with a conical helmet or crown and wearing a kilt. The right arm is raised in a smiting position, the left arm is bent at the elbow and the fore-arm held forward horizontally, and both hands are clenched to hold shafts. The left foot is advanced, in a pose suggesting movement. No analysis of the metal is yet available. It is now generally agreed that this bronze statuette is of Syro-Palestinian manufacture and of second-millennium date, probably of the fourteenth to twelfth centuries b.c. (Negbi 1976, no. 1412; Seeden 1980, no. 1811; Bisi 1980, 7-8; Tusa 1983, 512), and Tusa has noted that the figure represents Adad or Reshef (see Harden 1962, 86 and fig. 51). The circumstances of the find preclude any information concerning the destination to which the statuette was bound at the time of its loss at sea or of the date it reached the west Mediterranean. Current hypotheses and opinions have recently been summarised by Bisi (1980, 7-8) and Moscati (1983, 6); though it cannot be proven that the statuette did not reach the west Mediter- ranean at a later date, current opinions suggest it was carried west late in the second millennium b.c., either by Syro-Palestinians or 'Phoenicians', perhaps in the eleventh century b.c. (Moscati 1983, 6; Tusa 1983, 512), or by Mycenaeans, perhaps with a Cypriot connection (Vagnetti 1973, 467; Bisi 1980, 7-8). 2. Male figure in benedictory pose from Flumenelongu (Alghero-Sassari) . Only the upper part of this statuette survives. It was found long ago in the village surrounding a nuraghe at Flumenelongu, which is situated some 20 kilometres north-west of Alghero (Bisi 1977, 912, 916 and pl. XXXHÍ, 1; Bisi 1980, 8-9, pl. Ill, 1; Barreca 1981, 405 and 49Here, the term 'pre-colonial' will be used to refer to the period before c. 850 b.c.

LXXXI, 2), It is now in Cagliari Arch. Mus., inv. 21388. Judging by its present condition, the figurine is of rather poor craftsmanship; the lower torso and legs are missing, and the surviving part now measures some 9-4 cm. It is impossible to be certain whether the figure was seated or standing. The male figure wears a conical helmet, crown or hat, and the upper torso is nude. The right hand is raised in a benedictory or praying position, with the palm held forward; the left arm is also bent at the elbow and the fore-arm held forward horizontally with the hand clenched, a pose similar to that of the Sciacca statuette. No analysis of the metal is as yet available. Though the fragmentary state of the figurine from Flumenelongu prevents its certain classification (Negbi 1976, no. 1494), the similarity of the modelling, together with the position of the arms and hands, recall those of Negbi's male figurines Type IV, 'Male Deities and Worshippers in Benedictory Pose' and Type V, 'Enthroned Male Deities and Worshippers' (Negbi 1976, 42-58), and it is generally agreed that the bronze figurine is either of Syro-Palestinian or 'Phoenician' manufacture (Barreca 1980, 121; Barreca 1981, 405; Tore 1981, 22), or perhaps of strong Syro-Palestinian tradition but made in a Cypriot workshop (Bisi 1980, 9). Though most general and some individual analogies offered, like that of the smiting figure bought in Beirut and now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Bisi 1980, 8; Moorey, Fleming 1984, no. 11) are of late second-millenium date, estimates for the date of manufacture of the Flumenelongu figure vary considerably. Opinions range from that of Bisi, who would place it at the end of the second millennium b.c. (Bisi 1977, 916-9), a dating accepted by Lo Schiavo (1976c, 15), through that of Barreca, who recently has suggested a date of c. 1000 b.c. (Barreca 1981, 405), to those of Lilliu and Tore, who have proposed a time at the end of the ninth or during the eighth centuries b.c. (Lilliu 1966, 288; 1980, 72; Tore 1983, 456). The figurine came from a nuragic village, but there is no further stratigraphic evidence for the find. Nevertheless, it is worthy of note that other bronzes from the site may be dated well within the Italian Late Bronze Age (Lo Schiavo 1976c, passim). Naturally, opinions concerning the date at which the figurine reached Sardinia vary with those held upon the probable time of its manufacture and, as in the case of the Sciacca statuette, it cannot be proven that the Flumenelongu figurine did not reach Sardinia long after its manufacture. All that can be said with certainty is that, if the figurine is of east Mediterranean manufacture and second-millennium in date, then it is not impossible that it reached Sardinia towards the end of the second millennium, perhaps on a Mycenaean ship with a Cypriot connection (Vagnetti 1973, 467). Those who view the Flumenelongu figurine as made during the first millennium b.c. usually suggest it was carried west by the Phoenicians, and either see it as evidence for very early 'pre-coloniaF contacts between the Levant and Sardinia (Barreca 1981, 351), or as among the Phoenician-Punic imports or influences upon Sardinia in the full colonising era (Lilliu 1966, 288). The many inter-relationships of the groupings of bronze statuettes of second- millennium date from the east Mediterranean area, together with their chronology, are becoming clearer (Negbi 1976; Seeden 1980; Moorey, Fleming 1984), and with these firmer foundations it may become possible to propose a convincing hypothesis for the present indecisive evidence from the west Mediterranean. There is no doubt that second-millennium Syro-Palestinian statuettes, and perhaps bronzesmiths,</page><page sequence="54">54 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI reached Cyprus and there influenced the local Late Cypriot III products; examples of such figurines, either imported to Sardinia from Cyprus or showing strong Cypriot connections, are discussed below. Such Late Cypriot III figurines, or their influence on local types, seem absent from Greece, but it is clear that Syro- Palestinian statuettes of late second-millennium date reached Greece in the Mycenaean age. Well-stratified examples are recorded from Phylakopi and Mycenae (Seeden 1980, nos. 1814, 1815 and 1817); others, often from votive or sacred sites, and of indeterminate or later contexts, may have arrived in Greece during the first millennium. Besides the examples from Italy noted above, some Syro-Palestinian statuettes of second-millennium date are said to have come from Spain, though none have good contexts (Bisi 1980, 10-12); like the Sciacca and Flumenelongu figurines, the Spanish examples provide no certain evidence for east Mediterranean contacts, be they direct or indirect, in the west Mediterranean during the second millennium b.c. &gt; •Another statuette from Sardinia should be mentioned here; it is the bronze figurine from Olmedo, which will be more fully discussed below (p. 59). Though generally believed to be of Sardinian manufacture, this significant figurine has close affinities with some Syro-Palestinian statuettes of second-millennium date. Together with the Flumenelongu import and with the figurines from Paulilatino and Galtelli, to be discussed below as imported from Cyprus or showing strong Cypriot affinities, the Olmedo figurine comes from a nuragic context. As in the case of other bronze forms including the tripod-stands mentioned above, the writer knows of no certain nor even likely bronze statuettes of east Mediterranean manufacture and second- millennium date from Phoenician-Punic sites of the west Mediterranean, sites at which they might be expected to occur if they reached the west during the colonial age. As has been stressed above, evidence for direct Syro-Palestinian or 'Phoenician' contact with Italy during the second millennium is weak and it is therefore of great importance to note a recent opinion that the lettering upon the fragmentary stele from Nora, on the south coast of Sardinia, is Phoenician and of eleventh-century date (CIS 1, 145. Cross 1984, 60-3. See for previous references). II. FIGURINES FROM SARDINIA, IMPORTED FROM CYPRUS OR CONNECTED WITH LATE GYPRIOT III TYPES 1 . Fragmentary male figure from Galtelli (JVuoro) Fig. 16, 1. This fragment of a small figurine was reported in 1979 and had been found, perhaps together with 23 other objects, during trenching works near Galtelli (Lo Schiavo 1983b passim and pl. LXXXIII). It is now in the Coll. Berardi. The condition of the fragment is poor with only the upper torso and most of the arms surviving; the head is missing and the fragment now measures 1 -9 cm. in height. Details are few but it is probable that the torso was nude, the right arm is bent at the elbow with the fore-arm extended forward and the left arm is held with the hand pressed against the chest, a pose suggesting prayer or offering. No analysis of the metal is yet available. Fulvia Lo Schiavo has drawn attention to the rarity of the pose of the Galtelli fragment and compared it with that of the much larger Horned God of Enkomi, which is generally agreed to have been manufactured in Cyprus and to be of Late Cypriot III date, probably of the first half of the twelfth century b.c. (Catling 1964,</page><page sequence="55">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 55 255-6 and pl. 46; Seeden 1980, 122 and 131). The condition of the Galtelli fragment makes it impossible to decide whether it might be of east Mediterranean, perhaps Cypriot, manufacture, or a Sardinian imitation. The context provides no evidence for dating, for the figurine was not securely associated with the other finds, and these are not a closed group, varying considerably in date from fragments of nuragic bronzework, a fibula which might be dated to the eighth century b.c. and part of a buckle. 2. Seated female figure from Paulilatino [Cagliari) Fig. 16, 2. This complete figurine was found in 1967 at S. Cristina, near Paulilatino, a nuragic site with a sacred well some 25 kilometres north-east of Oristano (Bisi 1977, 912, see for references, 919 and pl. XXXIII, 2; Bisi 1980, 9-10; Barreca 1981, 405 and fig. 408; Tore 1981, 15, 23; Tore 1983, 455- 7). It is now in Cagliari Arch. Mus. The figurine is poorly modelled and some 9 cm. in height; it was designed to be viewed from the front only, the thin profile being only schematic in form. The face has sunken eyes and a prominent nose; a /tiara-like feature rises above the head and around the neck is a coiled band, which falls forward over the chest. The thin arms are held at the level of the breasts and the hands are clasped; the legs and feet are pressed close together, and a flange for attachment projects forward from the feet. No analysis of the bronze is as yet available. The thin bronze female figure in a seated position recalls those of Negbi's female statuettes Type V, 'Enthroned Female Deities and Worshippers' (Negbi 1976, 90-5). These, together with the corresponding male statuettes, often were designed to be seen from the front only with the profile view schematic; of the examples illustrated by Negbi, further features indicated in the Paulilatino figurine and clearly shown on the fine Syro-Palestinian statuettes are the sunken eyes and hair or head-dress of tiara-like form of an example from Ras Shamra (Negbi 1976, no. 1648) and the coiled necklaces or neck-bands of some examples (NegBi 1976, nos. 1644, 1646 and 1648). The type of statuette of a seated figure, designed to be viewed from the front only, passed to Cyprus and was imitated there, as is demonstrated by the small, male seated figurines found at Enkomi (Catling 1964, 253, nos. 2 to 5, pl. 45). The general aspect of the modelling, together with the coiled band shown around the neck and falling forward over the chest, of the Paulilatino figurine is similar to that of a figurine from Mandas (Tore 1983, 460, no. 8, pl. 82, 1) and may also recall the small female figurines from Cyprus, one standing upon an ox-hide ingot now in the Louvre, and the other in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, both of which are now generally agreed to be of Late Cypriot III date (Bisi 1977, 920-1, figs. 24 and 25). It is usually agreed that the Paulilatino figurine is of east Mediterranean manufacture and probably of very late second-millennium date. Barreca has believed it to be an import to Sardinia from the Levant or Cyprus (Barreca 1974, 198) and eleventh-century or c. 1000 in date (Barreca 1980, 121 and fig. 88), and has seen it as evidence for early cpre-coloniaP contacts between the Phoenicians and Sardinia (Barreca 1981, 351). Bisi tends to believe the Paulilatino figurine to be of Cypriot manufacture and probably close in date to the end of the second millennium (Bisi 1977, 921); Tore, though not excluding an earlier dating implies he thinks the Paulilatino figurine to be of late ninth or early eighth century manufacture, and thus could not have reached Sardinia before the full colonising era (Tore 1983, 457), Lilliu gives a similar dating (Lilliu 1980, 72).</page><page sequence="56">56 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI As in the case of the fragmentary statuette from Flumenelongu discussed above, estimates of the probable date at which the Paulilatino figurine reached Sardinia, and the manner in which it did it so, vary with opinions held concerning its likely place and date of manufacture. Again, it cannot be proven that this figurine did not reach Sardinia long after its manufacture, for the context in which it was found, a nuragic site with a sacred well, has not provided any clear stratigraphic evidence. All that can be said with certainty is that, if this small figurine is of east Mediterranean, perhaps Cypriot, manufacture and of late second-millennium date, then it is not impossible that it reached Sardinia at an early date, perhaps during the eleventh century b.c. (Vagnetti 1973, 467). On present evidence, the small figurines from Galtelli and Paulilatino seem to find their closest analogies in bronze statuettes, largely inspired by the great tradition of the Levant, which were made in Cyprus, have been principally found at Enkomi, and are of Late Cypriot III date. fit may be that these figurines from Sardinia, together with the massive evidence of other Late Cypriot III imported bronzes and those made in Sardinia but closely connected with Late Cypriot III types, provide a clue as to the manner and date at which Syro-Palestinian statuettes of second- millennium date reached Sardinia. III. SARDINIAN FIGURINES The Sardinian figurines, together with some of the other fine, cast bronze types from the island, are a profoundly exceptional series, whose forms have to date baffled any close comparisons with those of other regions. The vast majority of the Sardinian figurines and the other bronzes are notoriously lacking in a firm chronology based upon their stratigraphic or group contexts in Sardinia; very many come from votive or sanctuary sites, where closed finds cannot be confidently expected as within well- stratified habitation sites or a series of individual graves. Consequently, the best- dated contexts in which fine, cast Sardinian bronzes have been found are often those of Villanovan or Etruscan sites in west, central Italy. Until quite recently, examples were known only from eighth-century or later contexts and this allied with the knowledge of Phoenician activity in the west Mediterranean at the time gave rise to the impression that the Sardinian figurines were of a similar date of manufacture. Some scholars of the past have suggested that the date of manufacture of the Sardinian figurines might be early, perhaps beginning during the second millennium b.c., or that the question might not be resolved until better evidence becomes available (see Pinza 1901, cols. 214-15; von Bissing 1927; Müller 1932). More recently, the principal work on the Sardinian figurines and other fine, cast bronzes has been that of Lilliu and his great book, Sculture della Sardegna nuragica of 1966, with his datings based upon the evidence available at the time, remains fundamental. Through many of Lilliu's major studies runs the implicit conviction that any clear east Mediterranean influence upon the Sardinian bronzes should date after the arrival of the colonising Phoenicians in Italy, a moment now widely accepted as not before the late ninth or eighth centuries b.c. (see Moscati 1983, passim). Lilliu's opinions have influenced many scholars, so that it has become common to state that all of the Sardinian figurines are of the Italian Iron Age in date, that is that they were manufactured after c. 900 b.c. and probably after the late ninth century. Even when</page><page sequence="57">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 57 Fig. 16 Sketches of bronze figurines. 1. Galtelli 2. Paulilatino</page><page sequence="58">58 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI it is accepted that statuettes are of east Mediterranean manufacture and of c. 1000 b.c. or earlier in date, and that their presence in Sardinia may best be explained by 'pre-colonial' contacts, it is suggested that these imported examples ante-date the Sardinian series by some two hundred years (Barreca 1981, 405). Until recently there has been great difficulty in the recognition and dating of many of the groupings of east Mediterranean, including Syro-Palestinian, statuettes of second-millennium date, and it is still far from clear how many examples might have survived or the type been continued into the first millennium, and so been carried west even as late as the colonising age (Moorey, Fleming 1984, 75-6). Nevertheless, the writer would like to suggest that it has been largely the knowledge of the Phoenician-Punic colonisation of Sardinia that has tended to obscure any full acceptance by many scholars of influence from the east Mediterranean at the end of the second millennium b.c.; and it is revealing to contrast the agreement among scholars concerning the activities of the Mycenaeans in Italy, followed by that of the Greeks of the colonising age, against the lack of acceptance of the possibility of Levantine or Cypriot contacts towards the end of the second millennium b.c. in the light of the Phoenician-Punic colonisation. Though it is impossible to deny the possibility of occasional contacts between the east and west Mediterranean areas during the intervening centuries, and though 'trade' must surely have preceded the flag, there is still little evidence from Italy for such contacts during the tenth or early ninth centuries, or for Phoenician colonisa- tion before the end of the ninth century b.c.; for Sardinia, a crucial point of reference is that of the date, and interpretation, of the Nora Stone. Cross has recently suggested that this supports the view that the Phoenicians of Tyre were involved in colonisation in Sardinia no later than the ninth century (CIS 1 , 144; Cross 1984, 53-9. See for previous references). It is thus possible that east Mediterranean imports, followed by their influence in Sardinia, principally fall towards the end of the second millennium, the period under discussion in this article, or from the second half of the ninth century onwards, and that to some extent the events of the colonising period mirror or reflect those of the twelfth or eleventh centuries b.c., with east Mediter- ranean and Greek sailors returning to coasts and harbours well known to their predecessors (Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 6). If this be so, then it must be seriously considered whether there is any convincing evidence that at least some of the Sardinian figurines, and particularly those showing any second-millennium traditions, were made during the Italian Late Bronze Age. Evidence is slowly gathering to support this possibility, for it is known that east Mediterranean figurines of second-millennium date reached Sicilian waters and Sardinia, that figurines either imported or showing Late Cypriot III affinities have been found in nuragic sites and that it is not impossible that they arrived in Sardinia towards the end of the second millennium b.c. It has also been suggested above that bronzesmiths working in Sardinia were well-versed in Late Cypriot III traditions and capable of casting fine bronzes by the investment or lost- wax process and imitating Late Cypriot III forms, perhaps as early as the eleventh or tenth centuries b.c. An important indication for the date of manufacture of the Sardinian series was given by the discovery in 1957 of a small Sardinian figurine, together with two other cast Sardinian bronzes, a miniature container and part of a 'rattle', in a</page><page sequence="59">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 59 grave in the Cavalupo necropolis at Vulci. The grave is dated to an advanced but not final stage of the Villanovan I period, that is, probably during the second half of the ninth century or a little later (Falconi Amorelli 1966, 12 and pl. II; Lilliu 1966, no. Ill; Lilliu 1980, no. 134, here dated to the late ninth century b.c.). There seems no reason to place the figurine from Vulci early within the Sardinian series, at least those of the Uta-Abini style (F. R. S. Ridgway, forthcoming); certainly it provides a terminus ante quern for the manufacture of Sardinian figurines and suggests they were known and sought after in west central Italy during the ninth century b.c. As has been said above, the series of Sardinian figurines and other fine, cast bronzes has as yet defied any close comparison with any other group, be it of second or first-millennium date; if this were not so, the problems of possible inspirations for the series, and perhaps of its dating, would have been solved. Here it is not the intention to seek analogies for individual Sardinian bronzes from many east Mediterranean sources or over many cer/turies, a method which, perhaps with the exception of the Orientalising period, is open to criticism in itself. Rather, as the title of this article defines, it is proposed to focus upon the Late Cypriot period and, since Syro-Palestinian statuettes of late second-millennium date as well as those showing Late Cypriot III affinities, and the areas were in close contact for much of the relevant time, and are known from Italy, particularly in Sardinia, to concentrate upon any similarities between the statuettes of these areas with those of Sardinia, together with possibly related details from other east Mediterranean sources and types. The writer is well aware that the resemblances noted below between east Mediterranean examples of the second millennium b.c. and those of Sardinia are not conclusive, and will only attempt to rehearse some similarities and other points which may tend to suggest an early date for the manufacture of the Sardinian figurines, rather than one completely within the Italian Iron Age. The general style of the Sardinian figurines cannot be said to resemble those of the east Mediterranean area at the end of the second millennium b.c. If a relationship does exist, then a 'sea-change5 took place, in which, as in the case of the tripod-stands described above, bronzeworkers in Sardinia were aware of east Mediterranean models, but also conformed to Sardinian taste and local detail. The problem may first be approached through a consideration of the figurines, which Bisi (1977, 912, Type 2, 913) believes to be of Sardinian manufacture and east Mediterranean inspiration, and which may be connected with second-millennium types. An outstanding example is that of the complete male figure in benedictory pose from Olmedo (Sassari), which has been mentioned above (p. 54). It was found in 1926 at a nuragic site with a sacred well (Lilliu 1966, no. 175, see for references; Bisi 1977, 913, 923-4 and pl. XXXIII, 3; Barreca 1981, 406 and fig. 411; Tore 1981, 14-15 and passim, pls. IV and V). It is now in Sassari Arch. Mus., inv. 893. The standing male figure, some 10-4 cm. in height, has the right hand raised in a benedictory or praying pose with the palm held forward; the left arm is also bent at the elbow and the fore-arm held horizontally forward with the hand clenched. The left leg is thrust forward but the weight of the body rests upon the right leg, so that the figure is shown in a relaxed, not striding, position. The figure has a rather pointed beard, wears no head-dress and has a simple loin-cloth at the waist. No analysis of the metal is as yet available. Though a general similarity to second-millennium Syro-Palestinian figurines is</page><page sequence="60">60 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI evident, the Olmedo example does not conform with Negbi's major types, and several writers have suggested that it was made in Sardinia, though estimates of its date of manufacture, taken to depend upon an inspiration from the east Mediter- ranean, vary considerably. Vagnetti (1973, 467) and Bisi (1977, 924) hint at a Syro- Palestinian influence of second-millennium date; Lilliu (1966, no. 175; 1980, 72) and Barreca (1981, 406) believe the figurine to have been inspired by imports or influences from Phoenicia of colonising date. Recently, Tore (1981, 18-19) has proposed that the Olmedo figurine is itself an import, probably of the first- millennium or colonial date. With such a divergency of recent opinions, the Olmedo figurine is clearly a puzzling piece, and the record provides no stratigraphic or group context for the find, except that it comes from a nuragic site. On present evidence, the writer would incline to believe the Olmedo figurine to be more closely related to Syro- Palestinian examples of the late second millennium than to those of the colonising period; analysis of the metal might provide a clue as to whether the figurine was made in Sardinia or elsewhere. If it should prove to be of Sardinian manufacture, then the Olmedo figurine is an example of bronzesmiths in Sardinia closely following east Mediterranean models, probably of second-millennium date. Of the other figurines and types, which Bisi has identified as of Sardinian manufacture, inspired by east Mediterranean models (Bisi 1977, 912, Type 2), no others have so evident a relationship with second-millennium types. Nevertheless, the attitude of prayer with the right hand raised and the palm held forward, though usually with a gift held in the left hand, does recall many east Mediterranean statuettes of second-millennium date, and it may be worthy of note that the large, hollowed eyes of a Sardinian female offerer resemble those of many Syro-Palestinian statuettes of the second millennium b.c. (Lilliu 1966, no. 79; Negbi 1976, passim). It is difficult to estimate just how much reliance should be placed on unique or rare details of style or of items of equipment which may show resemblances between east Mediterranean models and the Sardinian figurines. Evidence for such equipment often only survives in pictorial or illustrative sources, and these are scattered in time and place. Nevertheless, the head-dress with feathers or plumes, the so-called 'feathered-crown', shown on the head, now without the body, of a Sardinian figurine, presumably of a warrior, should be mentioned here (Lilliu 1966, no. 44; Bisi 1977, fig. 28); this head-dress has often been compared with those worn by some of the northern enemy shown in the reliefs of the great temple at Medinet Habu in Egypt of Ramesses III, who reigned from c. 1 194 to 1 162 b.c. (Sandars 1978, figs. 80-2, see p. 134). A similar head-dress is also recalled in those depicted upon an ivory box from Enkomi (Sandars 1978, fig. 131) and on a seal, also from Enkomi and found under a floor of Late Cypriot III A date, which shows a warrior holding a round shield with a pointed or conical boss at the centre (Sandars 1978, fig. 132). The present writer has never been convinced by any east Mediterranean parallels offered for the elaborate protective armouring of leather covered with bosses, which is worn by two Sardinian bronze archers (Lilliu 1966, nos. 24 and 25; Bisi 1977, figs. 8 and 26) .50 More reliance may be 50The type of ship, so often represented in the fine, cast bronzes of Sardinia, may find closer analogies within the east Mediterranean sources of late second-millennium date than those of the colonising period. Ship-builders have always been conservative in their methods, so that those of the, east Mediterranean Iron Age may be expected to reflect traditions of previous centuries. Any similarity between the ships shown in east Mediterranean sources and Sardinian bronzes may well date to the end of the second millennium b.c.; compare the ship painted upon a vase from Skyros of Late Helladic III C date (Sandars 1978, fig. 85) with those of the bronze ship-lamps of Sardinia (Lilliu 1966, nos. 271 and following) .</page><page sequence="61">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 61 placed upon other features, often repeated in the Sardinian figurines and which may find resemblances in east Mediterranean sources of second-millennium date. Though the smiting pose is not found among the Sardinian figurines, Nancy Sandars recognised that some relationship is likely to exist between the conception and equipment of the splendid smiting figure standing upon an ingot from Enkomi (Negbi 1976, no. 1405; Seeden 1980, no. 1794 and see for references) and those of some of the warriors of Uta-Abini style from Sardinia (Sandars 1978, 161, 196-7, 199). Though stemming from the Syro- Palestinian tradition, the former was made in Cyprus and found in a sanctuary dated from the Late Cypriot III B to Cy pro-Geometric I periods; he wears a horned helmet and probably greaves, flourishes a spear and holds a round shield. The Sardinian figurines often wear a horned helmet, greaves and leather corselets and carry a round shield with a conspicuous central boss. Miss Sandars must be correct in suggesting that the Enkomi smiting figure on an ingot wears a horned helmet allied to those of the Shardana and probably other northern enemies shown on the Medinet Habu reliefs, or that it perhaps has a connection with Syria (Sandars 1978, 106-7, 197, figs. 82 and 91). As a practical piece of military equipment, the leather helmet with bulls' horns of this figure from Enkomi seems a more convincing analogy for those of the Sardinian warriors than any of the colonising age known to the writer. Some of the greaves shown on the Sardinian figurines, without bosses and of bronze or leather, resemble those current in the east Mediterranean in the late second millennium, and particularly the type with two ridges running around the rim. Though stemming from the Aegean, such greaves were adopted in Cyprus (Catling 1964, 140 and pl. 18a, b and c) and could have reached Sardinia from there (Sandars 1978, 199; see Lilliu 1966, no. 89; Guido 1963, pl. 47). The Sardinian warriors are often shown wearing corrugated corselets, presumably of leather, which cover their chests and pass over their shoulders. Be they of bronze or leather, and though the design for the protection of the vital points of the body seems to differ, ribbed or corrugated corselets are worn by northern enemies, also equipped with 'feathered-crowns' or horned helments, who are carefully depicted in the reliefs at Medinet Habu (Sandars 1978, fig. 82). A similar corselet is worn by the figure shown slaying a griffin, which is carved upon an ivory mirror handle from Enkomi (Sandars 1978, fig. 97). Moreover, and though the literature is far too large to quote here, round shields with a prominent central boss and broad-bladed slashing swords, both of which are shown in the Sardinian figurines (see Lilliu 1966, nos. 11,12 and passim) , find analogies at the end of the second millennium b.c., which are far more convincing to the writer than any of the colonising age. So many resemblances of the equipment, repeatedly occurring together, between that of the northern enemies shown in the Medinet Habu reliefs and in objects made in the Levant or Cyprus and often found at Enkomi, and so many resemblances of late second-millennium date in east Mediterranean sources with those of the Sardinian figurines are 'too close to be ignored' (Sandars 1978, 199). To sum up the evidence to date of the bronze figurines: in view of the second- millennium date of manufacture and the probable Syro- Palestinian or Cypriot place of manufacture of at least two and perhaps five bronze figurines from Italy, principally Sardinia, it is not impossible that statuettes made in the Levant or Cyprus towards the end of the second millennium b.c. reached Italy at that time, perhaps in Cypriot ships. Those who carried votive figurines to the west Mediter- ranean would perhaps have taken them to worship or dedicate, rather than to exchange or sell. It has been argued above that some Cypriot bronzeworkers also reached Sardinia during the late second millennium b.c. and that, perhaps during the eleventh or tenth centuries, bronzesmiths working in Sardinia were familiar with the skills of casting bronze by the investment or lost-wax technique. If the prototypes, perhaps the traditions of worship and dedication at sacred sites, together with the necessary skills were all present in Sardinia at the end of the second millennium b.c., then it is at least possible that some of the Sardinian figurines were made during the Italian Late Bronze Age, and long before the colonising era. It must be hoped that statuettes of east Mediterranean manufacture, their place and date of</page><page sequence="62">62 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI origin reasonably clear, will be found in secure contexts in the west Mediterranean; only such evidence can finally resolve the problems surrounding the inspiration and dating of the bronze figurines of Sardinia. XL CONCLUSIONS To sum up: the beginning of the contacts between Cyprus and the west, perhaps indicated by the hook-tanged weapons, should be omitted as the archaeological evidence is not satisfactory to date. We can place the first definite evidence for imported Cypriot pottery (White-shaved) at Thapsos within the fourteenth century b.c., while the Base-ring sherds from Antigori should belong to the thirteenth century, as well as the two sherds of Cypro-Mycenaean bowls from Scoglio del Tonno. As far as the ingots are concerned, they are an open problem; it is not yet proved that any ingots were made in Sardinia, though it is highly probable that they were. It is certain that Sardinian ingots were used locally and, assuming a local production, the only reasonable explanation for the adoption of the Aegean-Cypriot form is for the use in foreign trade. The types of ingots found in Sardinia have a wide chronological span through Late Helladic III and Late Cypriot II- III; in Italy, the only real chronological evidence is that of the presence of fragments of ingots in the Lipari Acropolis hoard, whose context is at the end of Ausonian I, dated by Bernabò Brea and Cavalier (1980) within the end of the twelfth century b.c. The place of origin - Cyprus, Crete or Sardinia - of these fragments of ingots cannot be defined. In Sardinia the majority of ingots are without association; some fragments of ingots, however, have been found together with bronzes of first millennium date. The Caldare and Milena basins, rightly considered as imports from Cyprus, can safely be dated to the thirteenth century b.c., both in Cyprus and in Sicily. The imported mirrors of Cypriot types from Sicily can be dated to the twelfth century b.c.; in Sardinia the Santadi mirror does not have a closed context but a date within the eleventh century may be suggested. The double- axes of massive, square section in the Enkomi hoards and from the Gelidonya wreck are dated c 1200 or the twelfth century b.c.; their closest parallels in Sardinia seem to be earlier than all the other double-bladed tools, being recurrently associated with bronze objects of Late Cypriot III affinities. The smithing tools can be taken as a group; in Cyprus they all date to the twelfth century and, with the exception of the charcoal-shovels, there are no later examples. In the west Mediterranean, all these forms of smithing tools are only found in Sardinia. Though none of them has yet been found in a dated archaeological context, the typological affinities with the Late Cypriot III bronze forms are totally convincing, and the charcoal-shovel now in Oristano, and perhaps the fragment from Carros too, are actual imports. The tripod-stand now in Oristano, and perhaps found together with the charcoal-shovel, is also a Late Cypriot III import, which may find among its closest analogies the miniature tripod-stand from a tomb near Episkopi, dated to the years after 1050 b.c., though it is likely that the tripod-stand was made somewhat earlier,</page><page sequence="63">LATE CYPRIOT IMPORTS TO ITALY 63 perhaps during the first half of the eleventh century. A similar date may be proposed for the imported Cypriot fragments from a tripod-stand, two cauldron handles and a miniature wheel from the Piediluco hoard. After this date, no other Cypriot imports to the west Mediterranean are known to the writers until the colonising age, but there is strong evidence of a flourishing industry in Sardinian bronzework, often imitating Late Cypriot III models. Neither the Santadi nor the S. Maria tripod-stands, both Sardinian imitations of the Late Cypriot III form, are from closely datable contexts, but it has been suggested that the S. Maria hoard may best be placed within the eleventh or the tenth centuries b.c. In the same way, several Sardinian handle attachments for metal vessels may be interpreted as imitations of very common Late Cypriot III or Cypro-Geometric I prototypes; such a Sardinian production seems to have reached the lower Tiber valley not later than c. 900 b.c., perhaps, with the real Late Cypriot III imports mentioned above. The bronze figurines ofithe west Mediterranean remain an open problem, but it may be that the great series of Sardinian figurines, cast with the finest craftsmanship by the lost-wax or investment process, also found its inspiration in the Late Bronze Age of the east Mediterranean. Leaving aside the hook-tanged weapons for the reasons given above, we may say that the first evidence of Cypriot imports, both pottery and bronzes, is documented in Sicily, where it may be put within the general framework of Aegean trade with the west during the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries b.c. The two Cypriot sherds from Scoglio del Tonno may also be placed within this general background. Sardinia follows the same pattern during the thirteenth century (two Cypriot sherds found together with Mycenaean pottery at Antigori), but there is a great concentration of Cypriot elements, mostly Late Cypriot III bronzework dating to the twelfth or eleventh centuries b.c., in Sardinia, which inspired a flourishing local production. In the light of this evidence, it is most acceptable that at least some Cypriot metalworkers settled in Sardinia at this time. The writers are well aware of the possible implications which may arise from such statements, which principally would concern the various exchange systems in metal ores and bronze objects between the east and west Mediterranean areas during the Italian Late Bronze Age, and some historical hypotheses involving the troubled conditions in the Mediterranean at that time. The writers believe however, that this article is not the place to enlarge upon the problems surrounding the activities of the 'Peoples of the Sea' and on the conflicts of the time, with all the subsequent movement of people (Sandars 1978, 97-103; Macnamara, Ridgway, Ridgway 1984, 6-7). Rather they have intended at this date to concentrate on and restrict themselves within the title of this article and to trust that future research upon the origin of the metal ores, techniques and typologies will soon bring further evidence and enlightenment on these historical problems. Fulvia Lo Schiavo, Ellen Macnamara, Lucia Vagnetti</page><page sequence="64">64 LO SCHIAVO, MACNAMARA AND VAGNETTI ADDENDUM Since this article went to press, some new archaeological discoveries concerning this subject have been made in north-central Sardinia. Although they do not affect the hypotheses and conclusions expressed above, these discoveries will be briefly mentioned, so that as much evidence as possible is presented here. A. Orgosolo (Nuoro). Twelve fragments belong to at least two distinct ox-hide ingots with protruding 'horns'. Discovery due to M. A. Fadda. B. Triei, north of Lanusei (Nuoro). Nuragic village Bau Nuraxi. A hoard with fragment of bronze implements together with fragments of an ox-hide ingot. Discovery due to M. Sanges. C. Ozieri (Nuro). S. Luca. Fragment of a 'horn' of an ox-hide ingot, together with a double-axe of type I and other objects. Discovery due to L. Campus. We also wish to mention a preliminary publication of the exceptional shipwreck at Ka§, Turkey, in which a great number of ox-hide ingots were found: G. F. Bass, D. A. Frey, C. Pulak, JNautArch 13, 1984, 271-9. In July 1985, an important archaeological exhibition concerning the nuragic civilisation of Sardinia was held in Milan. Many of the objects discussed above were exhibited; they include the ox-hide ingots from Serra Ilixi, the bronze cauldrons from Cala Gonone and the S. Francesco hoard, Bologna, together with all the objects identified as Sardinian from the same hoard, the double-axe from 'Chianciano', the tripod-stands from Santadi and from Bologna-Romagnoli, and a selection of Mycenaean and Cypriot sherds from Antigori. A well-illustrated catalogue was also published: Sardegna Preistorica. Nuraghi a Milano, Milano 1985. The preliminary illustration in this catalogue (p. 224, fig. 19) of a bronze bowl from Sardara (Cagliari) is of great interest; this bronze bowl has two handles with attachments in the form of a figure-of-eight, of the type suggested above for our type II, 4. Two chapters of the catalogue are particularly relevant to the subject of this paper; they are, M. L. Ferrarese Ceruti, 'La Sardegna e il mondo miceneo', pp. 245- 54, and F. Lo Schiavo, 'La Sardegna nuragica e il mondo mediterraneo', pp. 255-84. An unpublished part of the famous Chilivani hoard, to which our double-axe no. 20 belongs, with a new double-axe of the same type I, has been illustrated in the guide book Museo Archeologico di Ozieri, Ozieri 1985, 47.
