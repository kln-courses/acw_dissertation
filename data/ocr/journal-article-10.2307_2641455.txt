It will also be of significant interest to those wishing to compare the ecol- ogy, anatomy, physiology, and evo- lutionary history of mammals that live in different environs than the more widely studied terrestrial mam- mals. Unlike many multi-author vol- umes, this work is superbly edited, lending a uniformity of style that will make it useful as an advanced text- book as well as a reference compen- dium. Beginning with a fine chapter, "Marine Mammals of the World," by Reynolds et al., the book establishes a style in which competing views (e.g., concerning taxonomy) are treated in a nonargumentative style, encourag- ing readers to do further research and draw their own conclusions. The next four chapters, which deal with functional morphology, physio- logical problems of an aquatic exist- ence, sensory systems, and energet- ics, deliver complex material in a highly readable fashion. They in- clude sufficient brief reminders of basic biology so that readers will not have to rely on other texts to refresh their understanding of such issues before they embark on the compara- tive material concerning marine mam- mals. I would have liked more detail in some sections of the chapter "Liv- ing in Water: Solutions to Physiologi- cal Problems" (Elsner). Neverthe- less, the author's concluding message concerning the need to study inte- grated systems to gain knowledge of how the organism works, rather than exclusively concentrating on isolated aspects of its physiology, is an important contribution. We all need to be reminded that memoriz- ing lists of specialized mechanisms is not equivalent to understanding how organisms "work." The chapter on functional mor- phology (Pabst et al.) is well placed near the beginning of the volume. Understanding the limited knowl- edge of specialized mechanisms that allow mammals to live for much of their lives (or exclusively) in marine environments is a prerequisite to ap- preciating the challenges presented to authors of the remaining sections of the book. The understanding of some of the processes of both diver- gent and convergent evolution in producing these morphologies is fa- cilitated by a clear presentation of the varied anatomical specializations of marine mammals. In particular, the chapters consider the specializa- tions rendered by factors such as thermal challenges, osmotic difficul- ties in a saline environment, and changes in pressure as a function of diving. This chapter is the first of several that dwells briefly on the question of brain size and its relation to "intelli- gence." It is a pleasure to see the au- thors united throughout the volume in the understanding that "intelli- gence" may not be the best concept for making comparisons across spe- cies. What is "smart" for a dolphin to do may be exceptionally "ignorant" for a larger cetacean, a pinniped, or a human to attempt. As reviewed succinctly in this chapter, the varn- ous attempts to use morphological measures ranging from absolute vol- ume to brain-body ratios have not yielded much of predictive value con- cerning the relative intellectual abili- ties of species. For most marine mam- mals, we have limited knowledge of the functions of many parts of the brain. This is in no small part a result of the difficulties in acquiring permits to do invasive research on marine mammals. Much of wlhat is presented concerning probable functional spe- cialization amounts to conjecture based on apparent similarities to the morphology of better-studied terres- trial mammals. The conclusion of this chapter is paralleled in many other parts of the text, where it is empha- sized that the development of new technologies to allow in vivo measure- ment of physiological functioning will lead to much greater under- standing of the functional morphol- ogy of marine mammals. "Marine Mammal Sensory Systems" (Wartzog &amp; Ketten) includes an excel- lent selection of diagrams and review materials, that provides sufficient in- formation to explain the compara- tive sensory biology of marine mam- mals and their terrestrial relatives. It is unfortunate that the publishers have chosen not to use color in any of the illustrations throughout the text. Many of the photographs and schematic representations would have been enhanced greatly by contrast- ing colors. Nonetheless, the authors of this chapter have done an excel- lent job of compensating for this dif- ficulty by carefully using shading to make their representations easily un- derstandable. Appreciation of differences in the perceptual worlds of animals living in an environment that we can only visit, depends at the outset on our understanding of the differences in ways that they transduce segments of the energy that they encounter, and the specialization of their ner- vous systems in processing this in- formation. In a limited number of pages, Wartzog and Ketten have done an exceptional job of organiz- Conservation Biology Volume 14, No. 3, June 2000</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 917 ing the known facts of marine mam- mal sensory systems and providing the tools necessary to understand the biology and physics involved. The chapter on reproduction (Boyd et al.) is broken down conveniently into sections on carnivores, cetaceans, and sirenians, making it more useful as a reference source while simulta- neously allowing students using it as a text to produce organized notes. There is a disproportionately large amount of material on sirenians, but this is not surprising considering the involvement of some of the current authors in this detailed research. Peter Tyack presents some strong philosophical arguments against pre- mature and anthropomorphic judg- ment of the cognitive and communi- cative abilities of marine mammals. His chapter also provides an elo- quent introduction to some of the complex issues concerning echolo- cation in a variety of species. It is not often that these materials are presented in such clear and concise form. Similarly, the sections on the evolution of "advertisement displays" stays carefully close to the data, avoiding excessive speculation about probable functions. Wells et al. provide a chapter on behavior that concentrates on natu- ral history and ecology, avoiding the excessive concentration on captive studies apparent in some other texts that deal with the topic of behavior in marine mammals. Inevitably, there is some redundancy between chap- ters, the titles of which promise unique materials. For example, the chapters on "Behavior" (Wells et al. ), "Reproduction in Marine Mammals" (Boyd et al.), and "Distribution, Pop- ulation Biology, and Feeding Ecol- ogy of Marine Mammals" (Bowen &amp; Siniff) overlap considerably. Those adopting this volume as a primary text will wish to carefully integrate these chapters in their lesson plans. O'Shea's chapter on environmen- tal contaminants provides a brief in- troduction to some of the common misunderstandings and confusing no- menclature concerning toxic prod- ucts introduced by humans and their effects upon the environment. It also includes several tables and an exten- sive appendix that will be of use largely as reference materials con- cerning poisonous residues found in various marine mammals. In general, readers will find chap- ters in this work up to date and com- prehensive. Many who wish to use it as a text will glory in the fact that they do not have to produce massive readers to bring sufficient contem- porary detail to their courses. Rush out and get this book! Most of the authors contributing chapters to Conservation and Man- agement of Marine Mammals com- ment on the paucity of detailed in- formation on the ecology and exact current status of the species involved. Although the book exhibits the same fine writing and editing as in the com- panion volume Biology of Marine Mammals, some chapters are less comprehensive. In spite of the limi- tations of available data for some as- pects, the authors have done a re- markable job of making materials gleaned from disparate sources into flowing, readable chapters. For ex- ample, the chapter by Baur et al., "The Laws Governing Marine Mam- mal Conservation in the United States" provides an interesting historical nar- rative, giving context to materials which in themselves are rather dreary legalistic documents. Following a brief introductory chapter by the editors, there is an intriguing and informative chapter concerning "The Evolution of North American Attitudes toward Marine Mammals." Although most everyone recognizes that conservation atti- tudes have changed spectacularly in recent history, it is nice to be able to associate some specific numbers with these changes. Lavigne, Scheffer, and Kellert provide an informative selec- tion of statistics on issues ranging from public movement away from viewing marine mammals as com- modities or resources to more recent conflicts between "wise use" advo- cates and "animal protection" groups. Also of considerable interest is the growth in ecotourism and whale watching. For example, the estimated monetary value of whale watching around the world has grown from $14 million in 1981 to $504.3 million in 1994, with more than 5.4 million "wlhale watchers" involved in 1994. The chapter has a clear conservation bent but does a responsible job of re- viewing some of the attitudes of ex- tremists invoking "animal rights" argu- ments, and it places emphasis on the need for understanding the role of ma- rine mammals in evolving ecosystems. Delving more directly into the sci- ence of ecosytem analysis, Mangel and Hofman (chapter 4) essentially present a tutorial on definitions and techniques involved in studying eco- systems. They also caution against overgeneralizations between environ- ments and warn readers that many of the most common beliefs about ma- rine mammals as "indicators of eco- system health" may not hold up to careful scrutiny. An important empha- sis in this chapter is that ecosystems need to be dynamic in nature, that they are the results of "ongoing pro- cesses of speciation and extinction." The most critical matter concern- ing the long-term potential fate of marine mammal species is their in- teraction with fisheries. Northridge and Hofman (chapter 5) exhibit a management approach to regulating fisheries that will "reduce or elimi- nate conflicts between fisheries and marine mammals." Included is useful information for analyzing ways that methods for protecting marine mam- mals may benefit the fishing indus- try. Although such information may be difficult to transmit to those whose catch is "being robbed" by animals invading their fish-capturing appara- tus, it deserves more attention from those who establish and enforce laws for protecting marine mammals. Four case studies are presented briefly to illustrate some of the is- sues involved. The titles alone should entice readers: "Managing Fisheries Impacts on Marine Mammal Food," "Culling Marine Mammals as a Means Conlservationl Biology Volume 14, No. 3, June 2000</page><page sequence="3">918 Book Reviews of Improving Fishery Yields," "The Large-Scale High-Seas Driftnet Fisher- ies," and, "Harbor Porpoise Mortality in the Gulf of Maine Sink-Gillnet Fish- ery." Each topic is discussed in a dis- passionate and thoughtful manner, and the history of successes and fail- ures in conservation is documented. In logical sequence, this discussion is followed by Gosliner's chapter, "The Tuna-Dolphin Controversy." Here the reader will find detailed in- formation on the history of the prob- lem, associated legislation, attempts to enforce new protection laws with varying degrees of success, and the need for more scientific data. The ef- fectiveness of citizen groups in encour- aging both conservation legislation and enforcement also is emphasized. This is a case in which a relatively happy contemporary situation has followed many years of controversy and efforts to find feasible solutions to a problem of great severity. As Goliner phrases it, "dolphin mortality (as a function of the eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery) is no longer considered by most marine mammal scientists to be biologically significant." But the difficulties along the way, including the killing of more than two mil- lion dolphins in tuna nets and nega- tive effects on the U. S. tuna indus- try, are not glossed over in this detailed analysis. Fraker and Mate's chapter, "Seals, Sea Lions and Salmon in the Pacific Northwest," is a brief treatise that leaves the reader with an under- standing that much more research is needed to inform decisions about the role of pinnipeds in the reduc- tion of stocks of these commercially important fish stocks. The whole business of trying to evaluate when aquatic habitats have reached "carry- ing capacity" for individual species is a quagmire that is well identified in this chapter. Chapters 8 and 9 provide a stark contrast between the relative success of the Antarctic Treaty System in pro- tecting a "unique and fragile ecosys- tem" and the current endangered status of the International Whaling Commis- sion (IWC). According to Gambell's chapter, the very existence of the IWC is "threatened by the schism between proponents and opponents of whal- ing." Although there is an emphasis on the need for redefinition of the role of the IWC and incorporation of more scientific data in decision mak- ing, one is left with the feeling that this remains more a political than a scientific issue. The next several chapters focus on the biology and status of selected en- dangered species and management efforts underway for each. Ragen and Lavigne review information on the Hawaiian monk seal, Reynolds reviews efforts to conserve mana- tees, and Perrin reviews the plight of a number of small cetaceans at risk. All of these chapters recount dismal histories of conservation attempts and offer a mixture of mild hope with respect to the future and prescriptive advice concerning steps that may lead to the survival of some of the an- imals involved. Katona and Kraus re- view our limited knowledge of the bi- ology and behavior of the North Atlantic right whale, and address some of the problems in establishing the necessary steps for conservation of this species. Like the authors of other chapters, Katona and Kraus ex- press concern about the effective- ness of some of the regulatory agen- cies and commissions in enforcing and promoting conservation efforts. A paleontologist's perspective on "Endangered Species: The Common Denominator," is presented by Down- ing in chapter 15. In this brief exposi- tion, Downing centers his arguments on the clear and present danger of exploding human populations. The effects of human overpopulation and waste in contributing to histori- cally massive rates of extinction is emphasized as a moral dilemma that must be solved if there is to be a res- toration of balance in nature. Chapter 16 reviews some of the effects of marine debris pollution on marine mammals and suggests some partial solutions to these difficulties. This discussion is followed by two chapters that concentrate on research concerning marine mammal die-offs and the related matter of stranding networks. In addition to the scien- tific knowledge to be gained from efforts involving stranded animals, Wilkinson and Worthy emphasize the importance of these efforts in gaining the support of the public for conservation efforts. A growing con- troversy concerning the maintenance of marine mammals in captivity pro- vides the material for an interesting discussion of the opposing positions in this arena. Reeves and Mead (chap- ter 18) provide historical context for the controversy and a balanced view of the issues involved. The book concludes with a chap- ter ambitiously titled "Marine Mam- mal Conservation: Guiding Principles and Their Implementation." Unfortu- nately, the chapter dwells more on ideals than on the implementation of "guiding principles." Still, it is a nice touch to end a book on marine mam- mal conservation by having experts in the field summarizing their beliefs about principles that will best guide interested scientists and conservation- ists in general. Overall, this text has sufficient up-to-date information to make it a welcome addition to the li- braries of those interested in marine mammal conservation and manage- ment. It also has potential to be a book of considerable use as a re- source for classes emphasizing the conservation of marine mammals and for acquainting regulatory bod- ies with some of the history of con- servation issues.
