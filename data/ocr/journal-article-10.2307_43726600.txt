Pp. xviii + 324. $100. The cults and beliefs of the central powers of ancient cultures - variously called "national," "state," or "official" religion - have long dominated scholarly and popular inter- est in the religions of the ancient Near Eastern and classical worlds. Consequently, religious activities directly involving relatively few members of society have received the lion's share of attention, while those that permeated the lives of virtually everyone have been largely</page><page sequence="2">448 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 ignored. This volume, originating from a Brown University conference held in 2005, is not the first step in redressing this imbalance, for interest in the everyday religious lives of the general populace in ancient West Asia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome has become more promi- nent in recent decades; but it is certainly an important and valuable step. As a collection of essays that provides insightful consideration of family or household religious life in many Near Eastern and classical cultures, it has the added benefit of offering a comparative per- spective. That is, it allows readers to glimpse distinctive forms of the religious lives in spe- cific cultural contexts and also to identify phenomena that appear throughout the region and that may represent universal concerns. John Bodel and Saul M. Olyan provide introductory ("Introduction" [pp. 1-4]) and concluding ("Comparative Perspectives" [pp. 276-82]) chapters that set forth, respectively, the volume's intellectual agenda and the tentative conclusions that can be drawn. A primary concern is terminology. The title of the volume, using both "family" and "household" as descriptors of nonofficial religious phenomena, indicates the difficulty in selecting a single, suitable designation for the enterprise. The editors discuss those two terms and also consider "domestic," "private," and "popular." Many of the authors also wrestle with the attempt to find appropriate terminology and are careful to explain why they have chosen particular labels. Sometimes the terms found in ancient sources are employed, and social and spatial considerations are often deemed relevant. Still, the discussion of terminology would have benefited from more engagement with the models provided by anthropological and socio- logical literature on families and households. "Theorizing the Religion of Ancient Household and Families" by Stanley K. Stowers (pp. 5-19) is notable for exploring the fundamental issue of what is meant by "religion" when it comes to studying ancient cultures and also for drawing attention to the interlock- ing nature of religious, economic, and political practices in those cultures. The remaining essays discuss specific cultures. The first three deal with western Asia and Syria: Karel van der Toorn, "Family Reli- gion in Second Millennium West Asia (Mesopotamia, Emar, Nuzi)" (pp. 20-36); Daniel E. Fleming, "The Integration of Household and Community Religion in Ancient Syria" (pp. 37-59); and Theodore J. Lewis, "Family, Household, and Local Religion at Late Bronze Age Ugarit" (pp. 60-88). Next come several essays on Israelite religion, with the first two also including data from beyond Israel's borders: Rainer Albertz, "Family Religion in Ancient Israel and Its Surroundings" (pp. 89-112); Saul M. Olyan, "Family Religion in Israel and the Wider Levant of the First Millennium BCE" (pp. 1 13-26); and Susan Acker- man, "Household Religion, Family Religion, and Women's Religion in Ancient Israel" (pp. 127-58). Rudiger Schmitt's essay on the Philistines, "Ashdod and the Material Remains of Domestic Cults in the Philistine Coastal Plain" (pp. 159-70), is followed by two essays on Egypt: Robert K. Ritner, "Household Religion in Ancient Egypt" (pp. 171-96), and Barbara S. Lesko, "Household and Domestic Religion in Ancient Egypt" (pp. 197-209). Finally, the classical world is presented in three essays: Christopher A. Faraone, "Household Religion in Ancient Greece" (pp. 210-28); Deborah Boedeker, "Family Matters: Domestic Religion in Classical Greece" (pp. 229-47); and John Bodel, "Cicero's Minerva, Penates, and the Mother of the Lares: An Outline of Roman Domestic Religion" (pp. 248-75). The volume also provides a bibliography of citations from the essays and a helpful index.</page><page sequence="3">COLLECTED ESSAYS 449 Finding appropriate sources for research on nonofficial practices can be difficult. Most of the contributors rely mainly on written sources and thus risk depicting phenomena that reflect only the elites who produced the texts. Although several authors do note the prob- lem of generalizing from those sources, others seem to treat family or household practices known from texts as uniform throughout society. Archaeological data, of course, are extremely important for this enterprise, and virtually all of the essays draw upon them. In fact, Schmitt uses only material remains because of the lack of documents; the result is somewhat overspeculative in making assumptions - especially about anthropomorphic figures - without engaging the anthropological literature that explores ways to understand artifacts in the absence of texts. In contrast, Lesko's cautious speculation about figurines in Egyptian contexts is commendable. In general, however, the contributors are aware that their claims sometimes rest on inadequate evidence. Noteworthy in this respect is that sev- eral authors (e.g., Albertz, van der Toorn, Schmitt) forthrightly admit that they have revised some of their earlier views in light of new evidence or fresh theoretical perspectives. Not every specific case in this excellent collection presents information that relates to the data of other pieces. Yet sufficient overlap justifies noting some general patterns, many of which the editors discuss in their concluding chapter. One recurrent feature is that oppo- sitional categories - such as private versus public or popular versus official - often do not represent the realities underlying the data examined. In most instances, household or fam- ily religion seems to be integrally connected to rather than at odds with religious phenom- ena associated with larger social or political forms. Another frequent aspect, perhaps related to the importance of kinship structures in these premodern cultures, is the prominent place of deceased ancestors in family and household rites. Many, although not all, of the studies deem the role of women significant. Finally and unsurprisingly, religious phenomena that mark milestones in people's lives or the seasonal cycles and also ones that address the con- cerns of all people - about health, sustenance, and family continuity - are widely identi- fied.
