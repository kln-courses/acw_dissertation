<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEGINNING OF THINGS BY ARCHIBALD MacLEISH It is arguable that things don't begin or end at all. But in the face of human experience the argument is hardly worth making. Particularly in the field of letters, and more particu larly still in the acreage of narrative fiction, it is necessary to commence, and eventually it is desirable to stop. It' is not always essential to trace a hero "as Horace says, ab ovo", nor is it perhaps incumbent upon a novelist to be so exhaustive as Mr. Sterne, who began, "I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me?" but the necessities of time and space require a beginning some where. And it is no use for a novelist or a poet or any other sort of artist to act as though he had never begun at all but had merely recollected himself in the middle of a revery. Mr. Sherwood Anderson understands that, as well as the wisest of the ancients. He does not begin with a sleeping porch scene in the house of a perfectly strange man, nor does he break vio lently into the confidence of a girl who fancies herself alone, nor does he whisper scandal about someone whom you have never seen and who may, for all you know, live away off somewhere in the last paragraph of the book. He walks straight up to his hero and points him out. "There was a man named Webster lived in a town of twenty-five thousand people in the state of Wisconsin. He had a wife named Mary, and a daughter named Jane, and he was himself a fairly prosperous manufacturer of washing machines." Well, "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a</page><page sequence="2">368 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East." There you have Webster and there you have Job. There can be no doubt as to their respective identities and no question of a violation of confidence. Having gone some steps out of your way to look at them, you are satisfied that you have a right to know anything that there may be to know about them. And you assume that there is something about them worth knowing. You assume that from the fact that they have gotten into print. And you are persuaded from the deliberate and orderly character of these beginnings that you will find out everything decently knowable all in the writer's good time. So you read on and on, and after a while you find that there was something important about both of them. Job suffered patiently from boils and commiseration, and John Webster rejoiced im patiently in glands and a cleanly secretary. And your faith is justified. Stories which begin that way with the name of a man and the name of a place are more than chronological. They are human. They grow. There was such and such a man, lived in such and such a place, and had so and so?children or sheep or washing machines. And such and such things happened to him one after the other. And after a while he died. And that was that man. You don't see the whole of him, because the brevity of an author's life puts certain restrictions upon his work. Even James Joyce confined himself to twenty-four hours of Dublin. But the neces sary selection is practised not upon the skeleton of the man's history but upon the details of his existence. You see him emaciated, but anthropomorphic nevertheless. And such stories fall into the mould scooped out by the facts of things. From the point of view of man who lives time and breathes time and thinks time, all forms of art which move in time must have beginnings and middles and ends, for man him self has a beginning and a middle and an end. The temporal mind insists that the persons of a play or a poem or a story should come from somewhere in the beginning and should go somewhere in the end. They cannot simply happen, and they certainly must not be left around the stage when the play is over.</page><page sequence="3">THE BEGINNING OF THINGS 369 Hence the ageless stage trick and expedient of tragedy, which can be depended upon to clear the boards of the most reluctant Hamlet. And hence equally, and in like fashion, the predilection for marriage or its substitutes to sweep up after a novel of ro mance. Marriage and the grave are tidy and unobtrusive receptacles for souls. If it had not been for the short story and its parallels in the other arts, there could be no question about the merits of this sort of orderly arrangement of facts. But the short story made popular an entirely different model of display. The art of the short story writer consisted in laying out something called The Plot, which was a sort of intricate human tangle, and then magically unpulling the knot just before it choked the persons of the tale. The trick was to get the knot tied before anyone saw how easily it could be undone. And that required a great many rapid gestures and a considerable amount of distracting noise in the first few sentences. So you had stories beginning with the echoes of a scream which had just been stifled to the left of the first paragraph. "'My God!' gasped pretty little Nausicaa Nevers of Pride's Crossing, sitting up quite straight in her little bed." Plump?you're in it. What on earth made pretty little Nausicaa Nevers curse? And before you find out, or before you discover that you never will find out, the seeming tangle has been neatly caught and your fingers are working anxiously at the threads. Or you have stories which begin with a deliberate and brutal assault upon your intelligence. You read that "Lesbia was born upon a midnight bench in Madison Square at the age of three-and-twenty". Well?really?you protest. And then you are in over your head. Now of course that kind of beginning was unsatisfactory. It assumed that life was a collection of situations much like a collection of photographs in an album, and that the art of litera ture was the art of the projectoscope aimed at the most startling enlargement of each situation. It assumed further that human beings are artistically interesting as the figures in a situation. And of course they are not and never can be. They can not stand still. They are born and they live and they die and they do things and occasionally things are done to them. They make VOL. CCXIX.?NO. 820 24</page><page sequence="4">370 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW and unmake patterns with each other. But they are always in process, they are always changing, if it is only to become older. They live on a planet which commits gigantic spirals around the sun, and they measure their lives by the periods of its revolution. They are always at that juncture of then and then which is gone before they can call it now, and they are never anything but a sort of epilogue and prophecy of themselves. Even the two wounded soldiers, beloved of the lady magazinists, who fight in a shell hole and see too late by the flash of a burst that they are brothers, are not interesting as the numerators of a situation. They are, if they are anything at all, two boys who have recently been very different from what now they are. The only signifi cance of their dying bodies is the ironical conclusion of their living lives. As corpses crying "Brother ! " to each other in the columns of a sentimental publication, they are so much literary rubbish. Cross sections of time such as the magazinists attempt are like the linens of the Pharoahs which, spread out for admiration, are already dust. Nothing but a tracery of threads remains. Only changing things endure, and they endure only so long as they change. Dying is real, but death is a mere abstraction in the flesh. And this is so, of course, because the world we inhabit is not in any sense of the term a world of three dimensions. It is a world of four. It has length and breadth and thickness and then it has time?an oblique movement of all three. Things which have no time are as unreal in our world as a two dimensional silhouette in the world of paint. And no form of art worthy the name ever existed in contempt of the element of time. The picture or the lyric which seems most instantaneous rests most upon duration, for it represents a moment poised, a toppling of the wave. If it might be always, it would be commonplace. If it did not promise change, it would be stupid. Being momen tary, it is rare. Even the inertness of sculptured or imagined rest catches from time its loveliness. It is the lapse of ocean which foretells the tide, and stillness in the poplars which makes loud the wind. Great art never attempts the snapshot. It has its irony, and when it is most instantaneous it most suggests the before and after of time, just as the turn of a leaf or a momentary fragrance</page><page sequence="5">THE BEGINNING OF THINGS 371 may recall the whole sweep of a childhood. Snapshots have no irony. There hangs the hurdler in mid-air, forever balanced, as immovable as stone, a flick of mechanic light caught in a shut tered box. It is unimportant, and no part of the picture's meaning, to know whether he came to earth again or not. And the same thing is true of those literary efforts to emulate the camera which Mr. T. S. Eliot has apotheosized in his poem, The Waste Land. The aesthetic unintelligibility of this piece is due to its abuse of time. It is a syncopated variation played upon a moving picture machine in which the brain is flecked with the tatters of an anthology. It is not significant that analytical minds are fascinated by these flashes of interrupted light and find the labour of interpretation exhilarating. The human sense to which most poetry appeals is left untouched and cold, because these flashes are not only unintelligible but unreal. And they are unreal because they violate the revolutions of the earth. If we needed proof that there are limits to human experiments with humanity, we should have it in the artistic records of the last thirty years. And experiment in literary form is no exception. The Greeks invented all the forms we now use, not so much be cause the Greeks were clever as because the possible patterns were few. Not only are the malleable materials of expression few, but the directions in which they may be manipulated are fewer still. Literature does not escape by its thin trickle of sounds and signs from the boundaries set by nature upon marble and bronze, for its medium is not sound but the meanings of sound. It uses images which are as obstinately broad and tall and thick as the stubbornest piece of marble ever quarried from a hill. And it uses images which, out of time, would be as mean ingless as mountains without height and oceans without depth. Our minds no less than our bodies are lunar and obey the periods of the moon. And the breath of our understanding is time. Akchibald MacLeish.</page></plain_text>
