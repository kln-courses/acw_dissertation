<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRE-EGG STAGE IN TIIE ALBATROSS FAMILY. Biological Monograph No. 3. By L. E. Richdale. Otago Daily Times and Witness Newspapers Co., Ltd., Dunedin, New Zealand, 1950: 92 pp., 13 figs. Price 10s. from the author, 23 Skibo Street, Kew, Dunedin, S. W. 1, New Zealand. In the third of his admirable series of monographs, Richdale presents original observations on the breeding behavior of the Royal Albatross (Diomedea epornophora) on Taiaroa Head, New Zealand, from 1936 to 1949, and uses these as a basis for comparisons with the breeding behavior of the other species of albatrosses. For these comparisons, he draws largely on his own field experience wifh Buller's Mollymauk, the subject of the second monograph in this series, and from the writings of R. C. Murphy, L. H. Matthews, W. K. Fisher, and F. C. Hadden. By the term "pre-egg stage" is meant the period from the time the adults return to the breeding grounds until the egg is laid. The types of behavior observed during this period are named, defined, and discussed. Some of the names used for the behavior patterns seem overly anthropomorphic and at times inappropriate (as in the legend for figure 10 which reads in part "The fledgling . . . was refused further food and responded with the ecstatic ritual."). This, however, is quibbling, for the author never makes the mistake of interpreting the behavior anthropomorphically. The photographs which illustrate the types of behavior are a fine example of the value of photography in life history work. Too often bird photographers concentrate on taking pictures of rare or striking birds for the sake of the pictures themselves. Richdale's photographs illus- trate types of behavior and are thus important for their content as well as pleasing to the eye. In his papers on penguins and tubinares, one of Richdale's major contributions has been his discussions of "unemployed" birds, and this subject is treated at length in this study. Nine classes of unemployed birds are recognized: non-laying mated pairs (pairs which were</page><page sequence="2">216 THE WILSON BULLETIN Sept. 69N1 known to have bred in former years), non-laying paired birds (pairs which have not bred), mated pairs which lost eggs, mated pairs which lost chicks, birds which returned without mate, birds which attempted to breed elsewhere and later r2turned to Taiaroa breeding area, unattached birds, young birds which returned to place of hatching, and fledglings. The behavior of birds in each class is discussed, and the behavior of unemployed birds is contrasted with that of breeding pairs. The author's ability to identify individual birds, either by means of bands or by irregularities in the web of the foot, made this analysis possible. As might be expected, the comparisons with the behavior of species with which the author is unfamiliar in the field are not as full as one might wish. The fault lies in the inadequacy of the literature, as anyone who has tried to find good descriptions of even the simplest be- havior patterns will agree. Nevertheless, Richdale has made a definite contribution in pointing out what needs to be learned about the other albatrosses. His most important contributions, however, are the series of descriptions of types of behavior, which can be used by future workers as a basis for studying other species, and a full account of the breeding behavior of a second species of this relatively little-studied family of birds. The author is to be commended further for having founded this monograph series as an outlet for his valuable studies, and we hope that many more such monographs will folloW.- Robert W.
