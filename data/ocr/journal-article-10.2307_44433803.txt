Automotive Applications for Epichloro- hydrin Elastomers. W. R. Leach, B. F. Goodrich Chemical Co. In this paper the properties of epichlorohydrin elas- tomers are discussed and automotive applications which could benefit from them are suggested. The copolymer CHC (Hydrin 200) is an interesting new material for valve stem seals and O-rings because of its -65 to 275 F temperature service range and its excellent oil resistance. Suspension ball joint seals and spark plug boots may take advantage of its ozone resistance. It should also find acceptance in dia- phragms because of its combination of fuel resis- tance, low temperature flexibility, and ozone resis- tance. In brake, radiator, and fuel line hose, the ozone and fluid resistance of CHC will be attractive, and the high impermeability to gases and refrigerants may make epichlorohydrin elastomers valuable in air conditioner systems. 660002. Properties, Processing and Potential Automotive Applications of PPO Poly- phenylene Oxide Resins. J. W. Robertson, P. Shenian, and J. Allen Punkar, General Electric Co. Polyphenylene oxide resins, a new class of engineer- ing thermoplastics, offer the automotive engineer good mechanical properties which are relatively constant over the normal automotive operating tem- perature range. Parts molded of these resins are ser- viceable in a wide range of aqueous environments. The resins can be processed by conventio≈Üal thermo- plastic techniques. This paper relates the properties of PPO resins to automotive performance require- ments, discusses the prospects for satisfactory per- formance in typical use conditions, reviews basic processing information, and suggests potential auto- motive applications for PPO resins. 1967 SAE Transactions 660003. Polysulfone- A New Thermoplastic Resin for the Automotive Industry. R. K. Walton, Union Carbide Corp., Plastics Div. Thermoplastic resins have realized appreciable use by the automotive industry. There is additional op- portunity for a thermoplastic that more completely meets the requirements of a "working plastic," that is, one suitable for structural, load bearing, or under- the-hood uses. The potential use of polysulfone in these end applications is related to pertinent per- formance characteristics, which include consistency 660001-660006 of mechanical properties, resistance to creep, and resistance to environments encountered in an auto- mobile. The excellent performance of polysulfone under rigorous conditions, plus its toughness, paint- ability, and thermal and oxidative stability, suggest suitability for many automotive applications. 1967 SAE Transactions 660004. (SP-279) Visual Considerations: Man, the Vehicle, and the Highway - Part I. Dr. I. Schmidt, Visual Consultant. This treatise represents a short physiological optics review for designers and users of automobiles. It starts with a description of the microscopic anatomy of the visual organ. The movements of the eyes, the visual field, and fixation field are described in a more detailed way, together with the sensory mechanisms which comprise adaptation, contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, perception of motion, and perception of direction and distances. In view of their impor- tance in driving, special attention was given to the problems of glare, the time factor in vision and the visual problems in motion. A comparison of visibility of red versus green concludes the paper. An effort has been made to confine the text to the phenomena which are basic and necessary for general under- standing and have an obvious bearing on automotive design and driving procedures. (See 660164 for ab- stract of Part II) Discussion: Glenn A. Fry, Ohio State University. 1967 SAE Transactions 660005. Body Stress Analysis. R. A. Myers, Metal Stamping Div., Ford Motor Co. The use of theoretical stress analysis in the design of an automobile body is important for proper control of weight and cost. The loads, design standards, and test data that are considered in body design are dis- cussed in this paper. 660006. Lightweight Chain Saw and How It Got That Way. H. I. Hazzard, McCulloch Corp. The logger's chain saw is a portable tool in which weight is particularly important. The dollar value of weight must be established, yet its relative impor- tance must also be recognized. Interdepartmental cooperation is stressed along with design philosophy. Design details are discussed on a saw which is 22% lighter than the average of saws of similar displace- ment, and which provides the same features as a pre- vious model having 35% more parts. 61</page><page sequence="3">660007-660014 660007. 3.5 Horsepower in an 8-pound Package. R. Perle witz, Tecumseh Products Co. A new lightweight gasoline, two-cycle engine for portable tools is described. The total weight of 8 lb with an output of 3.5 hp was achieved by means of compact design with the use of standardized parts wherever possible, rather than by creating all new parts. 660009. The Present-Day Efficiency and the Factors Governing the Performance of Small Two-Stroke Engines. C. Waker, Fichtel &amp; Sachs AG. This paper deals with the present-day efficiency of small 50 cc aircooled, two-stroke engines, showing the essential performance characteristics of utility engines and higher output engines. The problems arising when output is increased by modification of the cylinders and exhaust systems are discussed, as well as the degrees of accuracy required in tne manu- facture of power determining assemblies. Some of the essential technical considerations involved in engine designing are also discussed. And some of the studies carried out to prove the suitability of the ex- haust system, combustion-chamber configuration, spark plug assembly, piston rings, and cylinder mate- rial are described. 1967 SAE Transactions 660010. Conversion of High-Speed, Aircooled Diesel Engines from Pre-Combustion Chamber Process to Direct Injection. H. Linnenkohl, Motoren-Werke Mann- heim AG. This paper discusses the direct injection combustion system as applied to diesel engines. A short review is given of the development background and associated problems arising during application of direct injec* tion with intense rotation of the cylinder charge. Test results are reported and these validate the mer- its of the system for air-cooled diesels. 660011. Diesel Engine Operation in Cold Wea- ther. R. C. Schmidt, Cummins Eng. Co., Inc. Many devices are available for winterizing diesel engine systems for cold weather operation. The key is adequate preparation down to the lowest expected starting and operating temperatures. Optional sys- tems are available which are simple and reliable provided the operator has them on hand and in con- dition to use before encountering cold weather. New and improved systems have been developed which include the positive engagement starter, the thermo- stat controlled glow plug air heater and the sus- tained-operation heater for the air intake system. Simple systems are available for ether induction, for heating of engine coolant, batteries, lube oil, etc. It appears that progress has been made with wider use and acceptance of the diesel engine such that cold starting is a provisioning condition for the diesel rather than a diesel problem. 660012. Cranking Motor Requirements. G. L. Cameron and C. W. Pettit, Delco-Remy Div., GMC. The cranking motor is basically a device for convert- ing electrical power from the batteries to mechanical power for rotating the engine. To obtain satisfactory cold cranking performance, the power available from the cranking system must be equal to or greater than the power required by the engine. Greater cranking system power can be obtained by increasing the bat- tery output and by matching the battery power with a cranking motor of adequate size to carry the higher loads without overstressing or overheating. This paper discusses the specific conditions that must be evaluated for determining the best way to improve cold starting. 1967 SAE Transactions 660013. Should There be a Truck for Cold Weather? K. K. Stubenvoll and F. J. Mul- ligan, General Motors Corp., Truck &amp; Coach Div. Every truck can be a cold-weather truck. A simple 25 amp wiring arrangement, plugged into a 110 v outlet at the terminal before the truck's daily run, activates a series of immersion heating elements which will raise the engine, radiator, battery, and the fuel in the tanks to summer starting temperatures. The results will be elimination of cold-weather downtime in ambients of as low as minus 40F, and assurance of normal battery life, without the addition of any main- tenance items such as plumbing or hosing systems. 660014. Multi-Grade Oil Proved by Ten Years9 Test Experience. L. J. Test, Atlantic Refining Co. Ten years of experience with multi grade oil in the Marketing and Refinery Department fleets of The Atlantic Refining Co. indicate that this type of oil can satisfactorily lubricate a variety of engines under a wide range of operating conditions. The fleets include such diverse vehicles and equipment as trucks (all types), tractors, cranes, loaders, and pas- senger cars. The use of the multigrade oil has proved the most economical method to obtain good 62</page><page sequence="4">low-temperature starting and at the same time retain excellent high-temperature performance. At ambient temperatures between 0-100 F, multigrade 20W-40 oil has been found to give excellent performance in all equipment during all seasons. 66001 5. Cold Weather Starting Aids and Devices; Coolant, Battery, Lube Oil, Fuel Filter Heaters; Clow Plugs and Starting Fluid. L. G. Solstad, Phillips Mfg. Co., Inc. A system to maintain or preheat engines and bat- teries to summer-like temperatures even in winter's coldest weather is described. This method applies heat to the areas causing problems. Proper utilization of aids will meet every requirement so engines will not only start but keep running regardless of weather conditions. Engines, starters, and batteries will per- form better and last longer. 660016. Engine Starting with New Pneumatic- ally-Controlled Ether Injection Sys- tems. K. B. Owings, Spray Products Corp. The use of ethyl ether as an auxiliary fuel for start- ing diesel engines is discussed. With ether, ignition temperature requirements are substantially reduced and cranking requirements to reach temperature for combustion are severely reduced. The means of applying ether are traced up to the introduction of the aerosol pressurized can, and culminate in the spray priming system. This latter system is described in detail. 660017. The Volvo Dual Powerplant for Military Vehicles. S. O. Krong√§rd, Volvo AB. This paper gives a brief description of the diesel-gas turbine powerplant, developed by Volvo for military applications. It describes the operation principles, the basic components and their relative arrangement, some of the basic philosophy and thinking behind the selection and design of the unit. Also described are the new combining gear and transmission ar- rangement with the interlockable free-wheels, as well as some other new features incorporated. Pos- sible future development of the system and possible applications are discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660019. Economic and Design Aspects of Gas Turbine Recuperators. N. L. Dyste and L. B. Peltier, Garrett Corp., AiResearch Mfg. Div. This paper discusses the role of recuperators in gas turbine systems and emphasizes the use of compact matrix designs in providing efficient packaging and height utilization of available space. Problem areas 660015-660022 encountered in recuperators for propulsion and pow- er conversion engines are noted in terms of design, fabrication prices and materials. Economic factors are compared in terms of initial cost and operational savings for various gas turbine applications. 1967 SAE Transactions 660020. Less Fuel More Torque - New Ap- proaches to the Automotive Gas Tur- bine. W. Hryniszak and M. A. I. Jacobson, Clarke Chapman and Co. Ltd. The rapid development of gas turbines raises a prob- lem of waste heat, that is, finding ways to recover the energy lost. This paper discusses air preheating as one method, using direct heat to exchanger conver- ters. The paper introduces a new design of gas tur- bine, the SCDGT, for automotive applications, and gives details of its characteristics, development test performance, and other pertinent specifications. It is shown how more torque is produced with less fuel consumption by this unit, and comparisons are made among gasoline, diesel, and SCDGT performances. Indications are that the turbine described here has many prospects as power units for civilian, commer- cial, and military uses because of its unique design, economy, and high torque range. 660021. Solid State Breakerless Flywheel Type Magneto Ignition. G. A. Guernsey and E. J. Brayley, Globe-Union Inc. Solid state breakerless flywheel magnetos eliminate breaker points and their attendant problems; no rub- bing or wearing parts are employed. Test results show unusually long life with no performance de- terioration. These magnetos are presently costly in contrast to conventional flywheel magnetos. When viewed with regard to their performance, durability, and installation simplicity, however, they are made presently feasible for certain applications. Volume usage will result in reduced cost. 1967 SAE Transactions 660022. Control System to Optimize Engine Power. P. H. Schweitzer, Schweitzer, and Hussmann Engrg. Office; C. Volz, Penn- sylvania State Univ.; and F. DeLuca, Am- erican Bosch Arma Corp., Amer. Bosch Div. A feedback-type electronic control system has been developed for optimizing the performance of power producing machines. The device continuously cor- rects the setting (for instance spark timing) of the machine for best power, which usually is also the point of best fuel economy. Instead of adjusting the setting from the outside, the engine is enabled to select its own best setting and to correct it continu- 63</page><page sequence="5">660023-660029 ously to always maximize the power output. The de- vice consists of four principal components: the Dith- er, which oscillates the setting continuously between narrow preset limits; the Celsig, which senses the most minute accelerations; the control, which re- ceives signals from the two; and a servo, which re- ceives commands from the control and adjusts the setting. 660023. Forward Look at Tube Transportation. R. M. Lewis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst. The high-speed tube transportation system proposed by Prof. J. V. Foa and under study at Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute is described, with particular atten- tion given to the areas of propulsion, vehicle sup- port, electrical power, and operation. Important re- ductions in power are possible through the use of a novel mode of propulsion which utilizes the tube and its contained air as the means for propulsion. The vehicle is supported by a fluid suspension and is capable of high subsonic or supersonic speeds. 660024. Stability and Controlability of Vehicles for High Speed and High Traffic Per- meability. Y. T. Li, Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. A general study of the basic requirements of vehicles for individual and public transportation systems leads to the belief that the incorporation of an active suspension system into the vehicle would constitute a major step forward. Various aspects of an active suspension system were scrutinized. Favorable re- sults from an experimental test vehicle confirmed that belief. By incorporating the principle of an ac- tive suspension system, a narrow vehicle was pro- posed for commuter traffic; a utility vehicle for agri- culture and military application; and a monorail ve- hicle for public transportation as well as for super high-speed intercity transportation. 660025. High Speed Ground Transport Propul- sion. S. W. Gouse, Jr., Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. This paper presents the results of considerations of various aspects of the propulsion power require- ments of high speed ground transport systems as yet unspecified. In addition to estimating propulsive power requirements by extrapolation of low speed performance (100 mph) of existing vehicles to high speed (400 mph and up) and by examining the re- sults of an apparently universal drag law, order of magnitude estimates have been made of a number of other factors associated with high speed travel, es- pecially in an enclosed guideway. It must be borne in mind that the purpose of these estimates is to iden- tify potential problem areas and establish order of magnitudes for preliminary thinking. 1967 SAE Transactions 660026. Automotive Battery Requirements- To- day and Tomorrow. R. E. Hojna, Chrys- ler Corp. Performance, economics, and reliability must be considered in the selection of a battery for any pas- senger car. The battery selected must provide ade- quate power to the starting motor, and the ignition system during starting. The battery also must supply adequate power when the operating load require- ment exceeds that of the output available from the charging system. To determine the proper battery needs for a vehicle the car manufacturer must evalu- ate: (a) the cold cranking requirements of the en- gine; (b) the hot cranking requirements of the en- gine; (c) the battery performance characteristics at both hot and cold temperatures; and (d) the balance of battery capacity, alternator output and accessory requirements. The above considerations are used to select a battery for a hypothetical passenger car, equipped with a 400 cu in. engine. Future battery requirements are considered briefly. 660027. Battery Performance - Negative Plate Improvements. J. W. Brodhacker, Elec- tric Storage Battery Co. Negative plate life has been improved by reducing the rate of sulfation of the battery. Chemistry sulfa- tion is briefly reviewed and factors in battery design contributing to improved sulfation-life are discussed. Emphasis is given to the "oil negative," which not only reduces sulfation of the wet battery but has been found to prevent effectively the oxidation of dry charged negative plates. 660028. Battery Cell Connector Improvements. D. Orlando and T. Oswald, Globe Union, Inc. Modern storage batteries must provide greater start- ing power to meet the demands of today's engines. An effective method of increasing starting power is to reduce the resistance of the cell connectors. Cell connectors formed by resistance welding through the partition prove to be reliable and efficient con- nections, meeting all requirements for storage bat- tery use. Batteries made with this type of cell con- nector provide considerably more starting power, particularly at low temperatures. This construction has been applied to all types of automotive batteries. 660029. Battery Ratings. R. Kruger and J. W. Bar- rick, Delco-Remy Div., GMC. Battery ratings set forth by the SAE Standard are used to specify minimum charge and discharge char- acteristics and minimum life standards. Some defi- ciencies with present ratings are discussed as well as the requirements for a good battery rating. Factors 64</page><page sequence="6">such as temperature, current, state of charge, elec- trolyte concentration, and battery age must be con- sidered in any rating. The development of perform- ance equations as a new rating method is suggested to widen the scope of present measures of perform- ance. 660030. Realistic Evaluation of Plastic Compo- nents for the Automobile Body. G. M. Wolf, Ford Motor Co., Metal Stamping Div. Realistic evaluation of plastic components for the automobile body is dependent on meaningful labora- tory tests and correlative field testing at stationary exposure sites and in fleet vehicles. Results of these tests are incorporated in material and performance specifications which stipulate the engineering re- quirements. Several case histories of actual devel- opment and application problems involving several plastics are reviewed. Some fifteen different types of thermosetting and thermoplastic materials are employed in the automobile body. These plastics are used alone, in combination with each other, or combined with metal, fiberboard, or fabric in a wide variety of body components. Engineering material and performance specifications are essential to con- trol the quality and durability of these components as related to their serviceable life. Standard industry test methods of the ASTM and numerous unique test methods are developed and employed in order to evaluate engineering requirements. 1967 SAE Transactions 660031. Decorative Finishes for Plastics in the Automotive Industry. M. Z. Thorson, Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., Inc. Decorated plastics for automotive applications are fast assuming first-rank importance to designers be- cause of outstanding properties such as crystal clear- ness, nonyellowing characteristic, high heat resis- tance, and better weather resistance. As first and second coatings, these physical and chemical prop- erties portend the role of plastics as primary automo- tive materials. Constant research by the plastics in- dustry is producing a stream of improvements and new products that have greater strength and are available at considerably lower cost than the metals they supplant. This paper describes the different kinds, the processes of their development, and the modes of application. 660032. Automotive Cam Profile Synthesis and Valve Gear Dynamics from Dimension- less Analysis. R. J. Erisman, International Harvester Co. The Fourier Series is used in the development of a continuous function to express cam lifts and accelera- 660030-660035 tions. The mathematics is extended to generate an acceleration response curve which includes the ef- fect of valve linkage flexibility. When a standardized acceleration diagram is established, the variables can be summarized in dimensionless design para- meters. Design charts for a parabolic-shaped acceler- ation curve, suitable for automotive applications, are included. The variables listed as dimensionless para- meters include life, half angle of event, ramp velo- city, flow factor, maximum positive acceleration, maximum negative acceleration, acceleration posi- tive pulse width, minimum tappet diameter, base circle diameter, and minimum radius of curvature. Methods of profile synthesis for unsymmetrical half angles of event and matching of profiles to flexible linkages are explained. A dimensionless design chart for valve springs is also included. 1967 SAE Transactions 660033. New Calculation Methods for Engine Bearings. H. W. Hahn, Rheinstahl-Ha- nomag. Hydrodynamic theory for bearings is applied for engine bearings with dynamic loads. Calculation methods are derived for computer and noncomputer use to determine film thickness, lubricant flow, tem- perature rise, and bearing reliability for different kinds of dynamic loads. Experiments on test rigs with dynamic loads and in diesel engines are result- ing in good correlation with calculations, and con- firm the proposed methods. Some typical behavior of bearings for diesel engines (in-line and V-form) are discussed based on calculation, experimental results, and practical experience; also with respect to engine dimensions, mean effective pressure, and mean piston speed. These calculation methods pro- vide important information to designers of engines, especially by demonstrating physical correlations between dynamic loads and bearing behavior. 1967 SAE Transactions 660034. Diesel Exhaust Valves. V. A. Johnson and C. W. Galen, Eaton Mfg. Co., Valve Div. A practical discussion summarizing the variety of common diesel exhaust valve failures encountered in the field is reviewed. The significance of diesel fuels and valve alloys with respect to exhaust valve corrosion was investigated, and is discussed in this paper. 1967 SAE Transactions 660035. Evolution of a Turbine Engine for In- dustrial Markets. L. E. Johnson and W. W. Davis, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A single-shaft, simple-cycle gas turbine engine has been developed to power 200 kw alternators for 65</page><page sequence="7">660036-660043 standby power and for applications where heat is needed. The engine was designed to be sold and serviced by distributors of earthmoving and indus- trial machinery. Where feasible, design practices of industrial piston engine powered generator sets were incorporated to facilitate installations of com- binations of engine types, and to limit novel and un- familiar features of the basic turbine engine to those that were considered essential. Individual compo- nents and complete engines, initially developed by a research group, have been subjected to a wide var- iety of laboratory tests to measure performance and develop reliability. 660036. Caterpillar Turbine Engine - A Com- plete Power Package. R. E. Kennemer, Caterpillar Tractor Co., Indust. Div. A new 200 kw gas turbine engine power package has been developed. This is a complete unit contain- ing the engine, reduction gear, power generator, and all necessary accessories and controls. This unit will be applied in continuous duty applications when there is a demand for exhaust heat recovery or in intermittent standby power applications. Power out- put and heat recovery characteristics are of interest in studying possible applications. 660038. High Strength Corrosion Resistant Copper- Alloy Tube for Hydraulic Brake Lines. B. J. Sirois, Phelps Dodge Copper Products Corp. A variety of high copper alloys have been studied to determine suitability for use in tubular form in auto- motive hydraulic brake lines. A 1% iron-bearing cop- per alloy in a light cold worked temper was found to have the strength, ductility, resistance to fatigue and to salt, and the stress corrosion characteristics re- quired for this application. 1967 SAE Transactions 660039. Variable Volume Hydraulic Motors. H. L. Von Hoene, Vickers, Inc. Hydraulic motors are usually used with various types of gear reduction mechanisms to power rotary de- vices; in some instances they are also used with cable where long linear travels are required. They are inherently small devices compared to other de- vices of the same power level. Their small size and light weight further make them ideal for installation close to the output. Since mounting attitude is not limited, they can be installed on devices which must move through many different gravitational relation- ships. Another advantage of hydraulic motors is the wide range of controls which are available to provide virtually any type of control system. The most preva- lent type of control used with hydraulic motors is the four- way directional valve. In addition to provid- ing forward and reverse control, this valve enables the operator to vary motor speed by metering the flow of oil to or from the hydraulic motor. With it, he can also jog the motor to obtain close positioning control. In general, hydraulic motors are simple to apply, the two most prevalent problems being dispo- sition of the drain oil and the shock pressures or back pressures generated by rapid operation. 660040. New Directional Control Valve for Re- motely Controlling Vehicle Hydraulics. R. E. Kay, Vickers, Inc. A new electrically controlled, proportional-control directional valve has been developed for application in the mobile industry. This valve promises to great- ly simplify mobile hydraulic systems and provide the unique advantages of remote control. This paper will briefly discuss the operation of the valve and illustrate its usefulness in a modern closed-center system. 660041 . A Look at Washing Insulators. R. A. Hill, Waterous Co. This paper reviews the problems of cleaning air- borne deposits from insulators; shows that hot-line insulator washing is a safe, fast, and economical way to do this job; describes the procedures and var- ious types of equipment used in hot-line insulator washing; and speculates on possible refinements of this equipment due to an increasing range of applica- tions. More electric utilities are becoming interested in hot-line insulator washing as contamination prob- lems in their areas increase. 660042. Design of a Compact, Self-Propelled Digger-Derrick. D. E. Broderson, R.O. Products, Inc. A new self-propelled vehicle has been developed for further mechanizing the operations of utility com- pany line crews. This unit is specifically designed for work in inaccessible areas such as the installation, maintenance, and replacement of distribution sys- tems located on residential easements. 660043. Vibrating Plows for Direct Burial of Cables, Wires, and Tubing. J. A. Kem- nitz, G. P. Buck, and L. F. Brisk, Illinois Bell Telephone Co. The purpose of this paper is to report on experi- ments, tests, development, and performance of vi- brating plows for direct burial of small cables, wires, and tubing. Utilities have great need for equipment that will reduce the cost of buying short service con- nections between the customer's house and the dis- tribution facility. Vibrating plows help answer that 66</page><page sequence="8">need. The report lists goals in design and minimum performance requirements for vibrating service plows. 1967 SAE Transactions 660044. An Auxiliary Solid State Low Fuel Warn- ing System. J. A. Stewart, AC Spark Plug Div., GMC. A fundamental change in the fuel indicating system on General Motors 1965 model cars necessitated de- velopment of a nonmagnetic electronic switch for actuating the low-fuel-level warning light. The switch compares an internal reference voltage against the tank unit sender voltage, and lights a warning lamp when the fuel level drops to a predetermined point, usually about one-eighth tank. No alteration of the standard indicating system is necessary, and the unit mounts at any desired location in the instrument cluster. 660045. Imperial Sentry Signal Warning Sys- tem. H. M. Merker, Chrysler Corp. The Sentry Signal Warning System was developed for the 1965-6 Imperial. By means of a single warn- ing light the driver is alerted to possible trouble caused by low oil pressure, high coolant temperature or low fuel level. This system complements the regu- lar gages and provides the driver with an attention- getting warning light. 660046. Pressure and Temperature Relation- ships Which Might Be Used to Antici- pate Coolant Boiling. D. L. Van Ostrom, AC Spark Plug Div., GMC. The conventional temperature switch presently used to anticipate boiling in an automotive cooling system is not completely satisfactory under certain conditions. Following an analysis of cooling system phenomena, the possibility is suggested of sensing both temperature and pressure to anticipate boiling. The vapor pressure comparator, a combination tem- perature-pressure switch, is described and its per- formance is analyzed with respect to cooling system phenomena. 660047. Circuits Using Functional Indicator Lamps in Ford Cars. J. D. Jenks, Ford Motor Co. Modern automobiles have a number of electrical circuits devoted to providing visual signals to the driver by means of indicator lamps. The circuits using indicator lamps found in Ford cars are re- viewed, including both the indicators which are re- quired by law, as well as those which are offered optionally. The unique characteristics of certain car models dictate variations in circuitry to accomplish 660044-660050 a function similar to all models. In some cases, cir- cuits and components are developed to achieve special features. 660048. Dimensional Stability and Structural Integrity of Labyrinth Seals. J. S. Alford and G. W. Lawson, General Elee. Co. Experience has shown that the noncontacting dyna- mic seals of high-speed engines require special me- chanical design considerations for long life and good performance. Dimensional stability and structural integrity are compromised if certain mechanical cri- teria are not incorporated into the design. This paper emphasizes mechanical design considerations, fail- ure experiences, "fixes," and an analytic approach to the mechanical design of labyrinth seals with par- ticular reference to applications to aircraft gas tur- bines. 1967 SAE Transactions 660049. New Lucas Fuel Control System for the Rolls Royce Spey Engine. K. A. Hatchett, Rolls Royce Ltd.; and B. E. Sparks, Lucas Gas Turbine Equip. Ltd. A new fuel system has been developed for the Spey engine. The system uses rotating metering valves controlled directly from engine signals together with a variable-stroke fuel pump which incorporates an improved servo control giving very fast response with stability. Nondimensional acceleration and deceleration control are obtained without the need for air temperature measurement. The integration of the pilot's full-range speed governor with the accel- eration control produces isochronous governor per- formance without the use of additional reset devices. The system is accurate over a range of fuels, is easily calibrated, and will tolerate fuel contamination. The simplicity of its design will promote reliability and reduce operating costs. 660050. New Alloys and Plating Systems Through Zinc Research. S. F. Radtke, Internation- al Lead Zinc Res. Organization, Inc. Two new zinc casting alloys have been developed to add to the family of zinc alloys in use for decades. A zinc-copper-titanium alloy (ILZRO 14) offers a cold chamber casting alloy with excellent casting characteristics, low porosity and superior surface finish with very good creep resistance for supra- ambient temperature applications. A gravity casting zinc-12% Al alloy (ILZRO 12) provides outstanding performance for prototype production as well as for limited production runs when tooling costs prohibit the use of die castings. These developments linked to existing die casting and wrought zinc alloys, com- 67</page><page sequence="9">660051-660058 bined with superior plating systems now available, provide improved design and styling flexibility and outstanding service performance. 660051. Zinc Extrusion. G. H. Laurie and J. R. Wellington, Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co. of Canada Ltd. The extrusion of zinc alloys, with special reference to zinc-titanium alloys, is described. Parameters for this process are defined. The excellent tensile and creep properties obtained in a typical extruded zinc- titanium alloy are presented. Extruded zinc with a quality copper-nickel-chrome plated finish offers a new approach to the production of automotive trim and of similar products. 1967 SAE Transactions 660053. Cooling Modern Aero Engine Turbine Blades and Vanes. A. Hare and H. H. Malley, Rolls Royce Ltd. Part one reviews the application of turbine blade and vane cooling in current Rolls-Royce civil aero engines, together with some side effects on engine design and development. Part Two presents a history of turbine blade and vane material improvement and of air cooling development as applied in these en- gines. Related problems affecting turbine blade and vane deterioration in engines are described, and an outline is given of a method of creep life deter- mination in cooled blades. 1967 SAE Transactions 660054. Air Cooling of Hot Turbine Parts. F. Burggraf and W. Houchens, General Elee. Co., Advanced Technology and Eng. Dept. The requirements and methods of high temperature turbine blade air cooling are discussed. This qualita- tive discussion includes the application of various cooling methods to the separate blade elements and the integration of these methods into a balanced de- sign. Analytical design methods utilizing experi- mentally derived data have provided high tempera- ture turbine designs for commercial and military applications. Successful results of cyclic and steady state endurance testing in component rigs and in en- gines has substantiated the reliability of these tur- bine designs. 660055. Control of Grain Shape and Its Effect on the Properties of Cast Components for High-Temperature and High-Stress Applications. B. J. Piearcey and F. L. Ver Sny der, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. A precision casting technique based on directional solidification, which imparts ductility and thermal shock resistance to high-temperature, creep-resis- tant, nickel-base superalloys has been developed at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. The desired improvement in physical properties is achieved by controlling the grain solidification process so as to eliminate trans- verse grain boundaries. Furthermore, the feasibility of producing parts using this "directional solidifica- tion process" has been demonstrated in both experi- mental and production foundry facilities. 1967 SAE Transactions 660056. Thermal Fatigue of Turbine Alloys with Special Reference to PWA 663 -Nickel- Base Alloy. M. J. Donachie, Jr., R. P. Brody, and E. F. Bradley, Pratt and Whit- ney Div., United Aircraft Corp. Thermal fatigue and bow evaluation of an alloy for aircraft gas turbine applications are considerably en- hanced by the use of miniature airfoil specimens, which provide a rapid means of sorting alloy compo- sitions. This paper discusses the merits of the test and specifically in relation to the newly developed PWA 663 nickel base alloy. The procedure in testing this alloy, which proves to be superior to cobalt base alloys, is fully described and the results are given together with those of a complementary strain cyc- ling test. 660057. Material Considerations for Long Life Jet Engines. G. J. Wile, General Elee. Co. The design of high-performance jet engines for long and reliable life has posed a series of important chal- lenges to materials technology. Reliable predictions of the behavior of the metals used is a formidable as- signment because of the long time interaction of steady and cyclic stress in a corrosive environment at high temperature. The most immediate problems are the loss of strength and the reduction of ductility resulting from long-time elevated temperature- stressed exposure of the nickel alloys used for "hot" parts. The problems of agglomeration of strengthen- ing precipitates, the formation of secondary phases, and grain boundary carbides are prominent struc- tural changes. The formation of the acicular sigma phase is especially sensitive to the chromium con- tent of nickel base alloys. Low chromium content inhibits the formation of this phase but invites hot corrosion. Improved strain cycling criteria are essen- tial to designing for cyclic life. The Coffin criterion is adequate at low temperatures but nonconservative at turbine operating temperatures. 660058. Rapid, Precise Measurement of Engine Oil Economy by a Radiometric Method. W. J. Mayer, C. P. Moore, D. P. Krause, W. H. Lange, and C. B. Murphy, General 68</page><page sequence="10">Motors Res. Labs; and J. J. Klepaczyk, Cadillac Motor Car Div., GMC. A rapid and precise oil consumption measurement in an automotive engine can be made in five to seven minutes by a radiometric method. Several hours are usually required for conventional methods. The radi- ometric method consists of tagging the engine oil with a radioactive tracer, 1,2-dibromooctadecane con- taining bromine-82. This material undergoes com- bustion with the oil, and the radioactive hydrogen bromide is extracted from the exhaust gas with one molar sodium hydroxide. Scintillation counting is em- ployed to determine the amount of radioactivity re- covered, which in turn is proportional to oil consump- tion. Oil consumption measurements were deter- mined over a speed range from 1500 rpm to 3000 rpm and over manifold vacuum ranges from 22 in. to 2 in. of mercury. It was found that the presence of lead, either as engine deposits or in the gasoline, interfered with the recovery of hydrogen bromide. Therefore, this method is restricted to non-leaded engines. In ad- dition it was necessary to add some bromine deriva- tive to the gasoline to act as a carrier for the tracer. A fuel consisting of isooctane with 4 cc/gal ethylene bromide proved satisfactory. The method is capable of 10% precision determined from pairs of duplicate measurements. When compared to conventional methods, the agreement is better than ¬±12%. Typi- cal oil consumption data obtained at various speeds as a function of manifold vacuum are given. Oil consumption data measured during engine break-in, unobtainable by conventional methods, are dis- cussed. Discussion: G. Hoyt Whipple, University of Michigan; H. F. Prasse, TRW, Inc.; Bruce E.

Webster, Chrys- ler Corp. The new 5 and 50 warranty program requires that careful records be kept of every car until it reaches the fifth anniversary of its sales date. At today's vol- ume, this means more than 8 million base records must be kept. Warranty claims are submitted to the Chrysler regional sales offices. From there they are sent to Detroit for microfilming, keypunching, payment, and analysis. The RCA 3301 is being used to process claims. Such things as vehicle serial number, body style, production date, option codes, sales date, selling dealer, color, trim, and certain special codes are maintained on the RCA 3488 RACE files. On each claim, transfer, or mechanical report, 660059-660062 the date, mileage, condition codes (that indicates the nature of the failure), microfilm reference number, MOPAR codes, as well as the amount of the claim are recorded. The system allows an inquiry as to the status of any one of the 8 million cars to be made, and an an- swer obtained in about 6 sec. 660060. Reliability Prediction from Warranty Data. B. H. Simpson, Ford Motor Co. From warranty data analyzed after six months or less of field service, one can predict product reliability and lifetime cost and repair rates ... as much as two and one-half years ahead-of-the-fact. In addition to reliability prediction, warranty data analyses can be used to identify differences in problem rates be- tween assembly plants, months of production, ven- dor sources, and vehicle options, and can describe the type of complaint for each part. This close track- ing of field performance quickly spots any new prob- lems, helps to identify causes, and guides future plans. This paper describes how Ford Motor Com- pany organizes warranty input data, analyzes it us- ing Weibull distribution programmed on a computer, and uses the results. 660061. American Motors Corp. Warranty Pre- dictions. A. J. Junker, American Motors Corp. Studies have shown that warranty expense per car, may be represented by a linear relationship through- out the warranty life of a Rambler car. Mileage ac- cumulation rates of the average owner, when applied to the expense data, allows accurate lifetime war- ranty expense predictions to be developed. The time required to obtain representative samples of the car population determines when the first forecast can be made. The procedure discussed, covers some methods of developing total warranty expense pre- dictions. 660062. Statistical Prediction Techniques for Analysis of Field Failures. L. G. Johnson, General Motors Res. Labs. In any statistical prediction problem involving items being used by customers in the field, it is important to attach the correct percentile number to each case of a failure. The method of "suspended items," that is, treating unfailed items together with failed ones, is presented as one solution in this difficult problem of placing failures in correct order within a popula- tion. Once this has been done, the prediction prob- lem can be solved in a straightforward manner, either graphically or numerically in a computer. 1967 SAE Transactions 69</page><page sequence="11">660063-660070 660063. New Applications of Data Processing for Comprehensive Control of Truck Maintenance. C. L. Hayden, Mobil Oil Co. New applications of data processing to truck mainte- nance give fleet managers an excellent means of re- viewing maintenance experience and controlling maintenance costs. Classifying each maintenance ex- perience according to the reviews to be made, and making a data processing record of each one, creates report patterns that uncover repetitive repairs, ineffi- cient procedures and practices, and inappropriate component selections. This paper describes the benefits of such a system and discusses the consider- ations, procedures, and problems involved in setting it up. The paper also points out the basic simplicity of the data processing techniques used and their applicability to fleets of all sizes. 1967 SAE Transactions 660065. Data Processing Applications for Rout- ing, Scheduling, and Maintaining Mo- tor Vehicles. R. R. Allen, A. T. Kearney &amp; Co., Inc. Data processing applications for motor vehicles maintenance typically include cost control or record keeping, application of garage labor standards, scheduling preventive maintenance or general re- pairs, timing of vehicle replacements, and new ve- hicle component selection. Fleet operators starting data processing control of maintenance operations should define long-range objectives, develop de- tailed plans, perform careful evaluations of data re- quirements, prepare estimates of costs for alternative systems, and plan a coordinated implementation program. The cost saving advantages claimed for data processing maintenance control systems often include improvements in basic management systems and procedures which can be realized without data processing techniques. The routing and scheduling of vehicles with data processing equipment is an ad- vanced technology. 660066. Instrumentation for Magnetic Pulse Metal Forming. D. F. Brower and R. A. Ayers, General Atomic Div., General Dy- namics Corp. Magnetic pulse metal forming results from kinetic energy imparted to a metallic workpiece by a mag- netic pulse. Control and measurement of this energy is purely electrical. Once the parameters are estab- lished for a particular magnetic pulse forming appli- cation, the process can be monitored by a single volt- age measurement. Because of general freedom from mechanical inertia, relatively high repetition rate capability (for example, 16 operations per second) can be built into the machines. Likewise, microsec- ond synchronization is feasible. Energy storage bank charging time is the main restriction on synchroniza- tion. Measurement of pressure on the workpiece can be derived directly from the value of the magnetic field at the surface of the metal by relatively simple equipment. 1967 SAE Transactions 660067. The Wallace Expanding Process. R. E. Roper, Wallace Expanding Machines, Inc. The art of stretch forming a sleeve of sheet metal into desired product shapes can be achieved, and in all cases the girth dimension is increased as the shaping is generated. Two basic types of expanded products to which this process can be applied are one-piece expansions and multiple-piece expansions. Impor- tant incentives to improving technology in commer- cial metal shaping such as material savings, quality improvement, cost comparisons, and shaping stabil- ity are discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660068. Plating Specifications- Are They Real- istic? J. D. Thomas, General Motors Res. Labs. Specifications for plated exterior trim for automo- biles are based on knowledge of corrosion behavior of nickel-chromium systems in service. The CASS and Corrodkote tests are tools for measuring this be- havior in a realistic manner. Corrosion cannot be eliminated, but it can be controlled to permit satis- factory performance. Conformance to the specifica- tions is necessary to maintain customer acceptance of plated decorative trim. 660070. What's New in Phosphate Coating of Steel. H. A. Kafarski, Chemical Process- ing, Inc., and Chem-Electro Processors. Phosphate coatings have been developed to serve many useful applications because of variations of coating obtainable, because of improvement in con- trol, and development of new processes. Important characteristics for the following facets are compared such as, typical application and functions; new de- velopments and improvements; types of coatings, final and supplementary finishes; basic processes; controls of process and quality; requirements of coatings; problems posed in applying; and effects of design and handling. Phosphate coatings have an essential role in industry not only for corrosion pre- ventive purposes but also for functional applications and for use as a production tool. 70</page><page sequence="12">660071. Lubricants for High Performance Tur- bine Engines. K. L. McHugh, Monsanto Co. Several lubricants now available have the requisite performance characteristics for use in the high tem- perature environments predicted for the Mach 2.0- 4.0 turbojet engines. Based upon bench and rig eval- uations, these lubricants promise performance levels of safety, reliability, and economy in the high Mach number engines equivalent to current commercial lubricant powerplant systems. Performance data comparing existing commercial aviation lubricants with the advanced Type 3 and Type 4 lubricants are reported and discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660072. Lubricant Requirements for High Tem- perature Bearings. R. P. Shevchenko, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div. Desirable lubricant properties for high temperature bearings are discussed from the bearing application engineering standpoint. This discussion is proceded by a short description of a jet engine lubrication sys- tem. The need for more realistic overall engine lubri- cation-system lubricant screening tests is stressed. Recommendations are made for incorporation of a thrust bearing rolling contact fatigue tester, an en- gine simulator, and more exhaustive engine evalua- tion in lubricant specifications. The case history of the compromises and their justification in the selec- tion of a highly successful five-ring polyphenyl ether fluid (PWA 524 or Skylube 600) for 500¬∞ F oil-in supersonic engine applications is presented. 1967 SAE Transactions 660073. Factors Influencing Aircraft Turbine Engine Oil Drain Practices. D. W. Be- dell, Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. In deciding what oil drain practices should be for a given aircraft/engine combination, the basic design of the engine is the most important factor. The meth- od of installation of the engine in the aircraft also helps establish lubricant limitations as does the sev- erity of operation of the aircraft. After the mechani- cal conditions and its surrounding atmosphere are set, the lubricant quality is the limiting factor in es- tablishing lubricant life or oil drain practices. 660074. Means of Assessing Aviation Turbine Lubricant Quality. A. E. Smith, G. Can- tini, and R. J. De Chard, Socony Mobil Oil Co., Aviation Dept. Various methods and tests are used for measuring turbine lubricant quality, but it is only by a thorough analysis of operation, maintenance and the overall 660071-660077 performance achieved under a multiplicity of condi- tions that the quality can be objectively assessed. Unless this approach is followed, the assessment of quality tends to be based solely on compliance to specifications with their limitations and engine or equipment inspection ratings with their inherent subjective factors. Assessment of a lubricant's qual- ity is also a continuing process. It is, in fact, a matter of endeavoring to determine its ultimate limitations. 660075. New Ford 3-Speed Automatic Transmis- sion. J. W. Greer and G. W. Schulz, Trans- mission and Chassis Div., Ford Motor Co. This paper outlines the design objectives of the 1966 Ford high capacity automatic transmission and dis- cusses the effect of these objectives on various trans- mission components. Major features described are a new 1-2 shift control and band cooling system, sin- tered iron applications, method of reducing thrust loads on engine crankshaft, and drivetrain resonance. Appendix gives general information on the trans- mission. 660076. International's New Motor Truck V-8 Diesel Engines. R. H. Malcolm, Interna- tional Harvester Co. A total vehicle concept was realized with the intro- duction of International's DV-462/550 engine series for diesel powered motor trucks. A large portion of gasoline engine tooling is used, but few parts com- mon to it are retained. The "M" system provides smooth and quiet operation, through controlled com- bustion. The author includes pertinent details on the operation of the combustion, breathing, and injec- tion systems, and he also outlines performance and design details. The engines are lightweight with low specific weight and high horsepower per cubic inch of displacement and achieve maximum output through speed rather than size. 660077.

The dis- cussion deals primarily with vertical loading (pay- load) and side panel design concepts; design consid- erations presented are general in nature. Final de- sign must include many factors too lengthy to in- clude. This paper does not describe in detail the ac- tual engineering theory of design, but uses simpli- fied analogies so that the basic concept can be under- stood and, thereby, encourage repair procedures compatible to original design. 71</page><page sequence="13">660078-660085 660078.

Specific approved techniques for patching, sealing, splicing, and joining of various dissimilar truck- trailer construction materials are outlined. The im- portance of using compatible replacement materials is particularly stressed. In cases of involved struc- tural repairs or alterations, however, these should be handled by professional or more experienced or fully equipped t√Øailer service shops. If any doubt exists as to the nature of the original material, the trailer manufacturer should be consulted. 660080. Auto-Pedestrian Collision Experiments. D. Severy and H. Brink, Institute of Trans- portation and Traffic Engineering, Cali- fornia Univ. Auto-pedestrian accidents - one of the most impor- tant factors in motor vehicle deaths and injuries - were studied with the precise techniques of full- scale accident simulation. Thirty-eight anthropometric dummies, instru- mented with tri-axial accelerometers, were impacted under representative auto-pedestrian exposure con- ditions. Under study were: The pedestrian blow by the striking vehicle and the pedestrian's correspond- ing body gyrations, displacements and subsequent pavement contacts varying with the size and speed of the impacting vehicle; the portion of the front-end contacting the pedestrian; the direction the pedes- trian was facing when impacted; the pedestrian height, and his walking or standing postures. Other factors under study concerned the relationship that vehicle braking and special vehicle structures bear to auto-pedestrian injuries. Thirty special photographic devices provided coverage for data reduction and documentary film production. Post-impact observations provided data of considerable value in accident reconstruction. 660081. Modern Approach to Piston Ring-Bore Assembly Wear Determination. J. A. Den Besten, E. G. Leverenz, and C. M. Bloom, International Harvester Co. The addition of the radiotracer method of wear meas- urement to the tools available to the development engineer is a great aid, but not a panacea. Its use in conjunction with the conventional approaches can expedite development testing. If the test techniques are properly selected and combined, the ultimate answer can be partially predicted, alternatives screened, and backup engine tests made in a smooth flowing test sequence. Data from two unrelated pro- duct development programs are given as illustration. Indications are that piston ring wear predictability can be measurably improved. 660083. Kryptonates: A New Technique for the Study of Wear Parameters. O. Cucchiara and P. Goodman, Parametrics, Inc. The use of the Kryptonate technique for the study of surface temperatures, chemical reaction rates, and erosion is discussed as it pertains to wear. Krypto- nates are solids into which radioactive Kr85 has been introduced into the surface layers to a depth of ap- proximately 10-100 millimicrons. Following stabili- zation at an elevated temperature, the kryptonated solids retain their Kr85 content indefinitely unless subjected to external stresses. Such stresses include temperatures in excess of the stabilization tempera- ture, chemical reaction at the surface, and mechani- cal removal of surface layers. Maximum surface temperatures and tempera- ture distributions have been measured by exposing unstabilized samples to unknown environments, and reheating them in a controlled chamber. That tem- perature at which Kr85 release first commences de- termines the unknown surface temperature. Since the loss of Kr85 from a sample depends upon the mag- nitude and duration of the stress, the technique per- mits measurement of rates of oxidation, or other chemical reaction, and of mechanical erosion to be measured with extreme sensitivity by determina- tion of the rate of loss of Kr85 activity from the sample.

The development of the inch-pound and the metric measuring systems is briefly outlined and the pres- ent status of each is discussed. Each of them is a com- plete and fully defined system suitable for sophisti- cated use. The metric system is the simpler of the two and is more coherent. The existence of two meas- uring systems is a serious handicap to essential world communications. More serious is the resulting difference in standard sizes, which provides an effec- tive barrier to free exchange of goods and design. The problem is complex and demands a thorough, competent, open-minded study to guide a concerted effort of U.S. industry toward the best solution. 660085. Measurement Systems and the SAE. R. P.

Success of the program depends on: total management support, careful planning, dynamic program administration, and intense employee indoctrination. The basis of the Zero Defects concept is the challenge to strive for error free performance, and the recognition of those who have accepted the challenge. 660092.

Fluid Performance in Automatic Trans- missions. E. D. Davison and M. L. Havi- land, General Motors Res. Labs. In order to determine transmission fluid require- ments, fluid performance in automatic transmissions has been investigated using engine-transmission- dynamometer test apparatus. It was found that the rate of fluid oxidation was essentially the same using two-speed and three-speed transmissions. Further, the rate of fluid oxidation was very similar in part throttle and full throttle cycling tests. In addition, the effect of fluid frictional deterioration on shift performance was similar between the two transmis- sion types. It is concluded that performance in the two-speed transmission can be evaluated using the three-speed transmission, or vice versa. The signifi- cance of the full-scale laboratory test results was con- firmed by establishing a correlation with car test results. Discussion: R. A.

Laboratory studies using bench, chemical, and dy- namometer tests were carried out to define some of the ways in which fluid degradation may occur and affect the serviceable life of an automatic transmis- sion, as well as how components, individually or in combination, may accelerate or retard fluid degrada- tion. Once these details were defined, the test results indicated two major conclusions. First, degradation products of an automatic transmission fluid (acids, sludges, varnish forming products, and so on) should be considered as new fluid components, since they may have more effect on transmission performance than the original components. And secondly, reten- tion of desirable friction control properties must be a prime consideration in the design of a satisfactory automatic transmission fluid. Discussion: S. R.

Procedures for the Evaluation of Auto- matic Transmission Fluids. W. K. Fuel- berth, H. L. Sharp, and R. A. Wilkins, Chevrolet Motor Div., GMC. The development of more powerful engines with higher operating temperatures, the trend toward lower axle ratios, and increased use of passenger cars for trailer hauling have imposed greater de- mands on the durability of transmission fluid. What had been reported in the past as unexplained clutch failures might have been more accurately recog- nized as oil failures due to lack of friction retention. Recent transmission fleet evaluations recording trou- ble-free service in excess of 100,000 miles can be attributed to a proper additive balance in the trans- mission fluid. This additive balance can be accom- plished either through a systematic oil change pro- gram, or by taking advantage of recent progress by the oil industry in the formulation and blending of transmission fluids. This paper describes Chevrolet's efforts to define desirable fluid characteristics and to describe the test procedures developed to evalu- ate transmission fluids. Discussion: E. F.

An outline of the field-testing of automatic transmis- sion fluids in two New York City taxicab fleets over a three-year period is presented. The field testing of six fluids in each fleet was found to be a suitable method for evaluating their relative quality. Some fluids performed satisfactorily for 11,000 miles while others were in service for over 90,000 miles. With ex- tended fluid drain intervals, the major cause of trans- mission malfunction was fluid oxidation. No signifi- cant relationship was found between the field test results and motor driven transmission and beaker bench oxidation tests. A fairly good correlation was established with engine driven cyclic transmission tests. The theory and modes of transmission malfunc- tion are also discussed. Discussion: R. A.

Studying Structure Dynamics with the Cadillac Road Simulator. E. R. Betz, Cadillac Motor Car Div., GMC An automobile structure is a complex, spring-mass system which is excited into various modes of vibra- tion by road inputs. The vibrational modes falling in the frequency range of 5-30 cps are termed struc- ture shake, and produce disturbances seen and felt by the vehicle occupant. The Road Simulator is a four-channel, servo controlled hydraulic exciter system used to simulate road excited structure vibra- tions in the laboratory.

Simple load con- trol programs are used which are within the capa- bilities of most fatigue test machines, as well as ¬´ servo-hydraulic test equipment. Two new concepts, test acceleration by the use of the "mixed cycle" S-N curve and a technique to simulate multiple modes of loading, are combined with known simula- tion methods to form the overall technique. The ap- plication of the technique to life testing of auto- motive components is shown and correlation to field life is discussed.

At this time, exhaust emission standards for oxides of nitrogen and for odor are being considered as addi- tional standards. Future standards may rate hydro- carbon emissions according to their smog potential. Another possible change that is discussed is to speci- fy the quantity rather than the concentration of pol- lutants that may be emitted from the exhaust of mo- tor vehicles. 660105. Exhaust Hydrocarbon Measurement for Tuneup Diagnosis? M. P. Sweeney and M. L. Brubacher, California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Bd. Recently attention has been focused on simplifying exhaust hydrocarbon measurement for potential use as a tuneup garage diagnostic tool. Work has been underway to evaluate new instrumentation and pro- cedures for hydrocarbon measurement suitable for field use. It is concluded that: 1. With a "one minute" cycle, measured emissions seem to correlate adequately with the California procedure. 2. There are prototype instruments which are in- herently much less susceptible to environment of use. 3. For engine diagnostic purposes, the principal uses of hydrocarbon measurements would be: An initial check - almost any engine malfunction raises hydrocarbons; hence, if low, engine does not need tuneup work. Recheck after tuneup - an increase in hydrocarbons indicates a tuneup oversight or error, and the car would then be checked further. 6601 06. Design and Development of the General Motors Air Injection Reactor System. W. K. Steinhagen, G. W. Niepoth, and S. H. Mick, General Motors Corp. The General Motors air injection reactor system meets the California standards for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission and will be installed on most 1966 GM cars and light trucks sold in Califor- 75</page><page sequence="17">660107-660112 nia. The various components of the system are de- scribed along with their calibration for optimum emission control, and the special techniques used to analyze the system performance on the California cycle emission test. 660107. Exhaust Emission Control by Chrysler -The Cleaner Air Package. E. W. Beck- man, W. S. Fagley, and J. O. Sarto, Chrys- ler Corp. Air pollution problems in California required con- trol of vehicle exhaust emissions. The early develop- ment of catalytic converters and direct flame after- burners led to relatively complex mechanisms with substantial added cost to the vehicle. An evaluation of the primary factors affecting exhaust emissions indicated the feasibility of control by engine modifi- cation alone. A series of engine modifications were subsequently developed which reduced the exhaust emissions to below the California standard of 275 ppm hydrocarbons and 1.5 percent carbon monoxide. The primary changes were to employ optimum com- binations of fuel-air mixture and spark timing at all operating conditions. These changes are known as the "Cleaner Air Package" (CAP). 50,000 mile tests indicated that with normal maintenance the exhaust emissions were stable and remained at a low level. The CAP system was put into production on 1966 model Chrysler Corporation passenger cars and light trucks marketed in California. 1967 SAE Transactions 660108. General Motors Air Injection Reactor Air Pump. W. B. Thompson, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., GMC 1966 models of General Motors passenger cars and light trucks sold in California are equipped with the General Motors air injection reactor system. This system meets standards for control of exhaust emis- sions. Saginaw's contribution to this system is the air pump, which supplies supplementary air for the in- jection system. The Saginaw air pump is a semi-articulated vane type pump of a positive displacement variety. The pump has a design displacement of 19.3 cu in. per revolution with high volumetric efficiency and low horsepower consumption. In the development of the pump, it was necessary to establish durability re- quirements consistent with the life of the vehicle, providing satisfactory performance without main- tenance. It was necessary to perform laboratory tests to insure compliance with these requirements. The Saginaw air pump satisfies all the design objec- tives and has been accepted for use on 1966 vehicles sold in California. 660109. Potentialities of Emission Reduction by Design of Induction Systems. E. Bar- tholomew, Ethyl Corp. As an alternative to oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust system, a research program conducted by Ethyl indicates that the vol- ume of the combustibles discharged from the cylin- ders can be minimized by redesign of fuel-induction systems. The objective is achievable without lower- ing of the level of acceleration performance or in- crease of fuel consumption. A two-stage carburetion system is employed in combination with a dual or single-barrel primary stage of the carburetor, which is used alone in cruising up to about 70 miles per hour, provides good mixture preparation and close to uniform fuel distribution to the cylinders. The one or two barrels of the second stage are brought into operation when maximum performance is desired. Other features of carburetors and manifolds are des- cribed that contribute to emission reduction. 660110. Anti-Smog Carburetor Hardware and Test Equipment. F. W. Cook, ACF Indus- tries, Inc., Carter Carburetor Div. Control of exhaust emissions from the automobile engine has added many requirements to those nor- mally established for the manufacture and perform- ance of the carburetor. This report covers the car- buretor work performed in meeting these new re- quirements of the automobile manufacturers employ- ing engine modification, air injection, or a combina- tion of both methods, for controlling exhaust emis- sions. 660111. Combustion Chamber Surface Area, a Key to Exhaust Hydrocarbons. C. E. Scheffler, General Motors Corp. Cars with engines having low combustion chamber surface area in relation to volume have correspond- ingly low exhaust hydrocarbon concentration on the California Schedule. Combustion chamber surface area relative to volume increases with compression ratio and number of cylinders, and it decreases with long stroke and larger displacement. 1967 SAE Transactions 660112. Hydrocarbons in the Dead Space of Flames: An Approach to the Study of the Flame Quenching Process. A. G. El- Mawla, EinShams Univ., United Arab Republic; and W. Mirsky, Michigan Univ. A porous plate, flat flame burner was used in an at- tempt to approximate the transient flame quenching process at the combustion-chamber walls in an in- ternal combustion engine with a steady-state model. The model used propane-air mixtures to provide a 76</page><page sequence="18">laminar flame propagating towards a relatively cool porous wall at approximately 1/16 the free flame velocity. Flame temperature and hydrocarbon concentra- tion profiles are presented, covering the distance from the wall to a point beyond the flame where the hydrocarbons were no longer detected. These were used to compute the total mass of unburned hydro- carbons per unit wall area. Results are presented for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.945 to 1.25, wall temperatures between 190-600 F, and combus- tion-chamber pressures of 1 and 2 atmospheres. 660114. Control of Auto Exhaust Emission by Modifications of the Carburetion Sys- tem. R. D. Kopa, California Univ. Carburetion of a lean air-fuel mixture is proposed for reduction of all major contaminants emitted from auto exhaust. Since the mixture lean limits tolerable by an internal-combustion engine equipped with conventional carburetor make this approach unsuit- able for nitrogen oxides control, exhaust gas recir- culation as a supplemental control method is con- sidered. Good fuel atomization and homogeneous mixing with air prior to admission into the inlet manifold eliminate "power surging" and extend the mixture lean limit of satisfactory engine opera- tion. These tasks can be accomplished by pneumatic fuel atomization carburetion. Experimental results ¬´ indicate effective reduction of unburned hydrocar- bons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides as well as good engine performance at air-fuel ratio settings over 18:1. 660115. Oxides of Nitrogen from Air Added in Exhaust Ports. R. S. Reid, J. G. Mingle, and W. H. Paul, Oregon State Univ. This paper presents the results of a study made to examine quantitatively the oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust of an internal combustion engine installed in a passenger car. The effects of adding secondary air in exhaust ports, with both a rich and lean carbure- tor, and for steady-state conditions, are reported. Ex- perimental setup and procedures are explained. 660116. Continuous Mass Spectrometric Deter- mination of Nitric Oxide in Automotive Exhaust. R. M. Campau and J. C. Neer- man, Ford Motor Co. Three techniques for the measurement of the oxides of nitrogen in automotive exhaust were evaluated. The techniques included a "nitrous fume" analyzer, a gaseous nitrogen dioxide colorimeter, and a mov- able mass spectrometer. All data obtained were com- pared to data from currently accepted wet chemical methods, the phenoldisulfonic acid method and the 660114-660117 "modified" Saltzman technique. Of the techniques evaluated, the mass spectrometer analysis of nitric oxide has been found to be the most useful for the study of nitrogen oxides in engine exhaust. The high cost of wet chemical analysis has indicated a need for an improved and continuous analytical method. Most analytical methods oxidize the nitric oxide (NO) which is present in exhaust gas to nitrogen dioxide (N02). N02 is highly reactive with other exhaust constituents and even with the sampling systems. The mass spectrometer approach measures NO with- in seconds of its discharge, thus minimizing any re- actions prior to measurement. Nitric oxide is moni- tored at the mass/charge ratio of 30, the molecular ion peak. Contributions to the m /e peak by other ex- haust components such as formaldehyde and ethane are less than five percent under most engine oper- ating conditions. For rich operation, a small correc- tion was used for carbon monoxide of molecular weight 30. The rapid response of the mass spectro- meter allows monitoring of NO in automotive ex- haust under transient conditions such as the Cali- fornia Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board Ex- haust Test Procedure. Typical MVPCB nitric oxide traces are shown with various carburetion and spark timing calibrations. Discussion: R. S. Spindt, Gulf Research and Develop- ment Co. 1967 SAE Transactions 660117. Fast-Response Flame-Ionization Detec- tor for Exhaust Hydrocarbons. L. B. Graiff and C. E. Legate, Shell Oil Co., Wood River Res. Lab.; and I. C. H. Robin- son, Shell Res. Ltd. A hydrogen flame ionization detector with a spec- ially designed sample inlet system has been de- veloped which makes it possible to continuously and accurately monitor the total hydrocarbon content of exhaust gases from a cyclically operating engine. The apparatus has a sample delay time (that is, the time required for the exhaust sample to travel from the sampling point to the detector) of about 1 sec, enab- ling it to follow rapidly changing engine operating conditions. Hydrocarbon emission (HCE) measure- ments with the fast-response detector are shown to be substantially higher and more indicative of abso- lute hydrocarbon concentration than values obtained using nondispersive infrared equipment according to the California test procedure. In addition, sample delay time is shown to affect apparent HCE values. By using high ratios of hydrogen-to-sample gas flow rates to the detector, errors in hydrocarbon measure- ment resulting from oxygen interference can be held to less than 10%, thereby making the device suitable for monitoring HCE from cars employing exhaust air injection for emission control. 77</page><page sequence="19">660118-660124 660118. Evaluation of Techniques for Measur- ing Air-Fuel Ratio. L. C. Broering, Jr., Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engrg. Center, U.S. Public Health Service. Four methods for determining air-fuel ratio by ex- haust analysis are compared. The methods selected for study are all potentially useful with analyses of integrated samples obtained in road tests or exhaust samples generated in the laboratory. A V-8 engine mounted on an engine dynamometer was used to generate exhaust, from which the air-fuel ratios were determined simultaneously by the various methods. The air-fuel ratio of the mixture delivered to the en- gine was determined by measuring directly the quantities of air and fuel supplied. This value was compared to those obtained by the four exhaust an- alysis techniques. Comparisons were made during normal operation and during conditions of deliber- ate cylinder misfire to simulate the most adverse combustion condition encountered on the road. One of the methods has distinct advantages which are discussed. 6601 1 9. Influence of Air Pressure and Tempera- ture on Carburetor Metering. J. A. Bolt and M. J. Boerma, Michigan Univ. This paper provides data concerning the enrichment of automotive carburetors with variation of inlet air pressure and temperature. These changes occur with weather and the seasons, with altitude, and be- cause of underhood heating. The early opening of the conventional carburetor enrichment valve at altitude can add greatly to the "normal" carburetor enrichment. Means for compensating the mixture ratio for these changes in inlet air conditions are known, but will almost certainly add to the complex- ity and cost of the engine induction system. The cost of improved devices must be compromised with the possible reduction in exhaust emissions and im- provement in fuel economy. 660121. Computerized Testing of Automatic Transmission Main Control Assemblies. E. J. Hughes, G. O. Boston, and P. A. Did- dens, Transmission and Chassis Div., Ford Motor Co. A new method of testing automatic transmission main control assemblies has been developed which provides increased reliability in transmission valve body testing. This method employs an electro-hy- draulic test stand sequenced by an IBM 1710 com- puter system. The computer controls the test cycle, accurately compares test values against test specifi- cation parameters, records all test values and deter- mines whether the transmission main control meets all specifications. This method has essentially elim- inated failure of final transmission tests due to out of specification main control assemblies. Test cycle time has been reduced by a ratio of 2% to one, and all test data is collected for statistical evaluation. Discussion: Martin W.

The use of computers in the Quality Control Depart- ment of an automotive assembly plant is described. The concept of Real Time reporting is detailed; in- formation on production problems affecting quality is relayed to appropriate areas for corrective action. All information is then processed daily to provide a 5-Day Summary Report on each quality variation. Computers are also used to assess repair time and to compare results of in service complaints with similar conditions at each assembly plant. 660123. Engineering Society Cooperation in Improving Dissemination of Engin- eering Information. F. Y. Speight, En- gineers Joint Council. The paper outlines a program of cooperation by en- gineering organizations to improve engineers' ac- cess to technical information. The program of Engin- eers Joint Council initiated in 1962 addressed itself to the fundamentals of information transfer in the written media, specifically to develop a Thesaurus for controlling indexing vocabularies and to encour- age greater participation by authors and editors in indexing technical papers, at the time of publication. Specific topics discussed are the rationale for the EJC approach to handling information, the Thesau- rus and its applications, primary publications, review practices, source indexing, education in information handling, pilot projects, and the steps taken toward establishing a coordinated engineering information system for the technical community. 660124. The New SAE Transactions. V. G. Ravi- olo, Consultant. A new form of SAE Transactions has been developed which allows for considerable flexibility in format, content, and distribution. A key volume includes abstracts of all SAE papers and a comprehensive depth index. Optional additions include printed and bound sets of all Transactions papers in full, sub- scriptions for all SAE papers, subscriptions for all SAE Transactions papers, and microfiche versions of each of these. No longer limited by physical size, all worthy papers can now be included in Transac- tions together with discussion, thereby enlarging the scope of Transactions approximately seven times. 78</page><page sequence="20">660125. New Features for Four Wheel Drive Vehicles. P. G. Axelrad, Ford Motor Co. Four wheel drive vehicles have long had a reputa- tion for hard riding and clumsy handling. A new coil spring front suspension, the development of a new driving front axle, along with better isolation of the chassis from the body, have been adopted for two new Ford four wheel drive vehicles with improved ride and maneuverability. 660126. Pontiac's New Overhead Camshaft Six Cylinder Tempest Engine. M. R. McKel- lar, Pontiac Motor Div., G.M.C. Pontiac' s new overhead camshaft six cylinder Tem- pest engine utilizes a neoprene, glass fiber rein- forced, timing belt for its camshaft drive. The suc- cessful application of this timing belt provides a quiet, reliable drive for the overhead camshaft. This engine incorporates for the first time hydraulically actuated zero valve lash compensation in an over- head camshaft valve mechanism. In its standard ver- sion, the new engine is equipped with a one barrel carburetor and uses regular fuel, while a four barrel premium fuel option is also offered. Increased en- gine performance, high rpm potential, economy of operation, good idle characteristics, smoothness and durability at high engine speeds, and exceptional ease of servicing have been achieved. 660127. Design Evolution of the Quadrajet Car- buretor. D. Stoltman, Rochester Products Div., G.M.C. This paper describes the technical evolution of con- temporary four-barrel carburetors to the new Quad- rajet by citing details of construction and their rela- tion to functional requirements. The critical design function recognizes valuable concepts, optimizes their design, and invents a unified assembly that will best satisfy foreseen markets. Finally, the design and its definition must complement new processing techniques in order to achieve maximum quality at reasonable cost. By understanding these engineering principles, the reader will gain a broad viewpoint of carburetor design and be stimulated to establish the proper perspective for further technical growth. 660128. Field Performance of Factory-Installed Anti-Freeze Coolants in Passenger Car Service. E. Beynon, Union Carbide Corp., Consumer Prod. Div. Four annual surveys have been conducted to deter- mine the condition of factory-installed antifreeze coolants during typical consumer usage after both one or two years of service. Over 25% of the cars required preventive or corrective cooling system service within the first year, and this increased to 660125-660129 47% or more in the second year. Dilution of the cool- ant with water in many cars reduced both freezing protection and corrosion protection, often to unsafe levels. The modern antifreeze coolant is capable of providing satisfactory year-round service in a leak- tight cooling system when accompanied by periodic cooling system inspection and preventive mainte- nance where required. However, many coolants do not give the anticipated service because of mechan- ical factors, inhibitor depletion from natural causes, and the practices of service men and car owners. 660129. Cylinder Pressure Variations, A Funda- mental Combustion Problem. D. J. Pat- terson, General Motors Corp. Cylinder pressure variation is a fundamental and widespread combustion problem in spark-ignited engines. The basic factors causing this problem are variations both in the start and in the rate of combus- tion. These variations occur not only from cycle to cycle within each cylinder but may also show up as consistent differences between cylinders. The pres- ence of these combustion variations means that the spark timing and carburetion for the engine must be a compromise. This reduces power and economy and increases exhaust emissions. Moreover, engine oc- tane requirement and combustion roughness noise are increased also. Our test results indicate that the major cause of cyclic combustion rate variation is the mixture velocity differences that exist within the cylinder near the spark plug at the time of ignition. Poor mixing of the fuel and air and cyclic spark tim- ing variations also contribute to this problem, but they account for less than % of the total pressure va- riation within one cylinder. Consistent differences between the cylinders of an engine are caused by a combination of consistent mixture velocity differ- ences, poor fuel distribution and geometric dissimil- arities such as compression ratio and spark timing. As yet we do not know how to reduce the cyclic mixture velocity variations and thus reduce the problem at its origin. However, it is possible to circumvent some effects of cyclic pressure variation by increasing the average combustion rate. This steadies the power output of the engine and allows leaner operation without objectionable car surge. This solution is particularly effective at light or road load operation where the combustion rate is very low. Manifold de- sign and intake valve location are factors which af- fect the average mixture velocity within a cylinder. Better control over combustion variations should lead to significant improvements in the performance of the modern spark-ignited engine. Discussion: P. H.

Effects of Deposit Properties on Volu- metric Efficiency, Heat Transfer and Preignition in Internal Combustion En- gines. J. P. Bradish, Marquette Univ.; P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Wisconsin Univ. Digital computer methods were used to investigate the behavior of engine operating characteristics with a time-varying gas-film heat-transfer coefficient and gradual buildup of combustion-chamber deposits. Simulated engine runs were made with a "clean" engine having different wall materials and operating at different engine speeds as a basis for comparison. From the data calculated, heat transfer rates were es- tablished and inferences drawn regarding trends of detonation, preignition, and volumetric efficiency during the deposit buildup period. It was found that, while thermal resistance (x/k)d of the deposit layer is the most important parameter, a secondary parameter of interest is the thermal penetration, Vkpc, in com- paring the effects of deposits of different properties.

This paper discusses possible improvements in compression ignition engine performance charac- teristics by greater utilization of the excess energy of exhaust gases of a typical engine. It also considers complications involved in this increased utilization as well as resulting differences in cost. Various direct and indirect methods of achieving results in these areas are suggested. Th√® almost necessary use of variable geometry in the turbine unit if any real prog- ress is to be made and the requirements involved in its use are also discussed. 660132. Future Development of Free Piston Gasifier Turbine Combinations for Ve- hicle Traction. F. J. Wallace, E. J. Wright, and J. S. Campbell, Free Piston Dev. Co. Ltd. The present status and future developments of auto- motive outward compressing free piston gasifiers are discussed, with particular reference to gas gener- ators in relation to turbocharged and compound en- gines, the present status of the machine produced by the authors' company, and the operating character- istics of a proposed 150 shaft horsepower gasifier- turbine-gearbox combination for vehicle traction. It is shown that under certain specified condi- tions, the gas generator cycle operates with superior efficiency, and with stated improvements in compo- nent efficiencies, the present gasifier will achieve a gas thermal efficiency of the order of 45%. Further, a vehicle power unit having an estimated specific weight of 8 lb shp and volume of 9.75 shp/cu ft for the complete unit, with an overall torque ratio of 10:1, can be realized. 660133. Influence of Turbocharger Characteris- tics on Supply of Air for High Speed Diesel Engines. J. H. Nancarrow, AiRe- search Indust. Div., Garrett Corp. Development of turbochargers with more favorable basic characteristics has significantly improved tur- bocharging at part speed and part load. Conse- quently, the engine air flow requirements for these operations can be met with less oversupercharging at rated power. As engine bmep ratings are in- creased, the engine as well as the turbocharger and controls must be made more compatible, to limit ex- cessive boost pressure in non-aftercooled engines and to avoid negative pressure differentials in after- cooled engines.

A fully operative test bed vehicle that has been built and tested demonstrates the a-c electric wheel drive concept. The tractive power for the 2% ton, 6x6 vehicle is provided by six 3-phase, squirrel-cage in- duction motors operated in a closed loop, controlled slip mode. The basic concept of motor operation in conjunction with a cycloconverter type of frequency changer is discussed. The drive system provides an infinite range automatic transmission with individual wheel controls, which enhances mobility and im- proves performance of over-the-road, off-the-road, and trail vehicles. 1967 SAE Transactions 660135.

Truck ride tests should be paired with theoretical analyses for efficient direction of ride development programs. Electronic instrumentation is used in ob- taining presentations of test and analysis results in a form that leads to rapid and correct engineering evaluation of the data. Data presentation systems are described for both time and frequency domain test- ing. Two specialized data presentation systems are also described. 6601 38. Power Spectral Density and Ride Evalu- tion. A. A. Butkunas, Ford Motor Co. Vibrational ride environment consists of all motion inputs to the passenger. If each input is properly re- lated to human discomfort, their combined values will produce an overall ride sensation index. This paper presents methods for analyzing and evaluating vibration measurements in an on-the-road environ- ment. For purposes of design information, the total comfort index is broken down into contributions of each input and each frequency component of that input. Thus, vehicular elements that are most detri- mental to ride can be pinpointed and improved. 1967 SAE Transactions 660139. Vibration Comfort Criteria. F. Pradko and R. A.

A new criteria - ab- sorbed power - is developed through the applica- 660136-660142 tion of transfer functions. Absorbed power is used to study ride comfort. Preliminary evaluation of this new measure indicates, with substantial credence, that absorbed power correlates with subjective re- sponse. 660140. Practical Approach to Truck Ride Evaluation. R. N.

The comprehensive presentations on ride instru- mentation are reviewed with special reference to the practical requirements for use in heavy, commercial highway vehicles. This leads to specific recommen- dations for (a) measurement equipment which is relatively uncomplicated, economical, and commer- cially available; and (b) road testing procedures which facilitate the acquisition and processing of essential data. New data on human response to vibra- tion, presented by Pradko and Lee, are correlated with previously proposed criteria to show important areas of agreement. Detailed procedures are rec- ommended for interpretation of vibration measure- ments in terms of human response. Desirable shock and vibration limits for cargo protection are also proposed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660141. Design, Application and Comparative Tests of Trailer Air Suspension Systems. O. L.

These changes have brought about new considera- tions for those responsible for designing and main- taining highway vehicles, as well as for those con- cerned with the effects of shock and vibration upon both cargo and operator. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design principles of Neway Equip- ment Company's trailer air suspension, to illustrate certain applications of this suspension system, and to present results of comparative ride tests.

Testing of Lunar Surface Vehicles Un- der Simulated Lunar Gravity Condi- tions. H. Schaefer, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. Three different methods of testing mobility systems of lunar surface vehicles (LSV) under simulated lu- nar gravity conditions and the types of mobility test articles (MTA) required for such tests are discussed. A proposed outline for an LSV mobility test program is given which is based on three types of MTA. These MTA' s are: a Block I, with a linear scale of 1/1 and a mass scale of 1/6; a Block II, which is es- sentially the MTA Block I ballasted to its full mass; and a Block III, which has a small linear scale and a mass scale corresponding to the applicable model scaling laws. The MTA Block II requires the use of a lunar gravity simulator; several types of such a simulator are discussed. 660145. Scientific Exploration of the Moon Using a Roving Vehicle. O. L. Tiffany and E. Zaitzeff, Bendix Systems Div., Bendix Corp. A planning study of support systems for use in con- junction with Project Apollo to explore the moon is described. Engineering design of the support sys- tems requires preliminary definitions of typical scientific mission plans. This paper discusses some of the more recent measurement results which affect decisions in lunar mission planning, including geo- physical techniques used on the earth which will be useful for lunar exploration, lunar site selection, typical sortie traverse design, and statistical data on lunar missions. 660146. Lunar Mobile Laboratory- Design Characteristics. R. E. Wong and L. Gal- an, Bendix Corp., Bendix Systems Div. System concepts for lunar exploration beyond cur- rent scheduled Apollo/LEM flights have been the object of study by both NASA and industry for sev- eral years. Notable is the Apollo Logistics Support System (ALSS), in which a lunar mobile laboratory (MOLAB), is considered as one of its payloads. Pre- liminary design studies of the MOLAB system have demonstrated its feasibility. These studies have shown that for an optimum system, special emphasis should not be placed on any single subsystem such as mobility, and that trade-off must be made between MOLAB's many subsystems. Subsystem design char- acteristics and performance specifically covered are: mobility, power, cryogenic storage, life support ca- bin, astrionics, and tie-down and unloading subsys- tems. 660147. Preliminary Mobility Tests of a Scale Model Lunar Roving Vehicle. W. B. Sponsler, Northrop Corp. In order to resolve some of the many variables as- sociated with lunar surface vehicle design and to evaluate early analyses and assumptions, an operat- ing model vehicle was constructed and tested over a wide range of surface conditions. The resulting test data permitted making preliminary performance comparisons of 4, 6, and 8-wheel, split-track and full- track vehicles, and predictions of prototype perform- ance. The conflicting requirements imposed by the variable mission and surface conditions stress the necessity for an adaptable or flexible locomotion sys- tem. Common wheel or track systems which employ fixed relationships with the ground cannot provide the combination of reliability, efficiency, traction, stability, and maneuverability so important to lunar missions. The test vehicle which employed the Northrop "Walking Beam Suspension" system per- mits the efficient use of scuff steering, and provides many of the advantages of a tracked vehicle at gen- erally higher mechanical efficiencies and improved reliability. It also promises unique advantages in performance and maneuverability, as well as opera- tional adaptability and multitask capabilities. 660148. Scale Model Testing of Land Vehicles in a Simulated Low Gravity Field. D. Schuring, General Motors Defense Res. Labs. The exact model rules for lunar vehicles whose per- formance on the moon has to be tested on earth are derived. A true picture of lunar performance can be obtained by taking high-speed motion pictures of a 1/6-scale model. The experimental restrictions im- posed by exact model rules can be relieved by resort- ing to approximated similarity to get away from the 82</page><page sequence="24">linear scale of 1/6. Examples are given for a full-scale model. 1967 SAE Transactions 660149. Locomotion Energy Requirements for Lunar Surface Vehicles. F. Pavlics, Gen- eral Motors Defense Res. Labs. This paper outlines an approach used for determin- ing locomotion energy requirements for lunar sur- face vehicles. Both analytical and experimental tech- niques are discussed based on methods developed for the mechanics of terrain-vehicle systems. Factors affecting energy requirements are considered in- cluding motion resistance, vehicle speed, slip, and mechanical efficiency. Motion resistance factors dis- cussed include grade, inertia, rolling, soft soil, and obstacle resistance. Special attention is given to energy expended due to surface roughness. Some experimental results are presented to verify the soundness of the approach. 1967 SAE Transactions 6601 50. Corollary Advantages of Lunar and Ter- restrial Vehicle and Power Train Re- search. D. Friedman, General Motors Defense Res. Labs. Lunar and planetary programs have entered the sur- face exploration research phase. In this phase, con- siderable emphasis is needed on high mobility ve- hicle configurations, reliability and high efficiency, low weight electrochemical energy converters, and electric traction power systems. This research, in many cases, is applicable to solving future mobility problems on earth. Three areas of current lunar and terrestrial research are discussed and analyzed, and the correlative advantages to those working in both fields are highlighted. The three areas are: (1) high mobility vehicle configurations; (2) electrochemical energy converters; and (3) electric traction power systems. 660151. Numerical Control at Ford Motor Com- pany. G. Pascoe, Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Company has developed and put into operation original computer programs and numeri- cal control systems for computing the non-analytical automotive body surfaces, and numerically ma- chining such surfaces on dies and other body tool- ing. Thousands of templates, hundreds of wood models and many lines of dies have been surfaced through the new systems. Quality, accuracy and sym- metry of numerical surfaces are superior to those produced conventionally. In combination with com- puter-aided design developments, N/C systems will be employed to perform or assist in a number of operations now performed conventionally in styling, 660149-660154 product engineering, manufacturing engineering and tooling, to improve tooling accuracy and pro- duct quality, and to minimize lead-time from clay models to production of new cars. 660152. Analytic Surfaces for Computer-Aided Design. W. L. Johnson, J. W. Sanders, and N. E. South, Ford Motor Co. A method of analytic definition of surfaces in space, which was proposed by Professor S. A. Coons of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was investi- gated and the results reported. The investigation in- volved: (1) development of computer programs to implement the method; (2) development of means to display the generated surfaces; (3) study of the na- ture of the surfaces which can be produced; and (4) determination of the control that the user has over surface shape. The method was found to be well adapted to computer use and to available display equipment. It produces a great variety of surfaces over which the user has excellent control, and it holds promise in surface design and replication applications. A motion picture was made on the computer to demonstrate various study aspects. 1967 SAE Transactions 660153. Computer-Aided Design in Body En- gineering. W. M. Hogue, Ford Motor Co., Metal Stamping Div. Mathematical definition and manipulation of part surfaces within a computer assists the body engin- eer in the design of automobile components and in the evaluation of tentative designs. Methods have been developed to rationally design hardware me- chanisms, to evaluate optical distortion characteris- tics of tentative windshield designs, and to generate data about the effects of component tolerances. Methods have been established for the application of analytic surface methods to actual body parts. 1967 SAE Transactions 6601 54. The Toronado- A New Breed. J. B. Beltz, A. K. Watt, J. H. Diener, W. A. Weidman, and R. J. Schultz, Oldsmobile Div., G.M.C.; J. R. Doidge, Hydra-Matic Div., G.M.C.; and D. P. Marquis, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., G.M.C. Major phases of the Toronado design and develop- ment are described. The purpose is to provide gen- eral orientation in the arrangement and features of this new front wheel drive automobile, and to give insight into why and how the car was developed. The use of front wheel drive to permit combining all power and driving components into a single unit ahead of the passenger compartment, proved to be 83</page><page sequence="25">660155-660161 an important element in attaining an improved ve- hicle. From a design point of view, front wheel drive is a very clean way to lay out an automobile. When all the machinery is grouped together in the front, it permits a lot more freedom in designing space for the passengers. It also gives the chance to reduce ex- terior size. The car has a 4 in. shorter wheelbase, 6 in. less overall length and 1.5 in. less width than the regular rear drive Starfire hardtop coupe. This reduc- tion in exterior size is aided by the more efficient use of inside space as the result of eliminating the floor tunnels and kick-up over the rear axle. There are a great many possible ways to arrange the components in a front drive car. The important thing about the composite drive system on the Tor- onado is that it uses space most efficiently. This single unit, consisting of engine, transmission and differential, occupies very little more space than the engine alone in a rear drive car. 1967 SAE Transactions 660155. Ammonia as a Spark Ignition Engine Fuel: Theory and Application. E. S. Starkman, H. Newhall, R. Sutton, T. Ma- guire, and L. Farbar, California Univ. Anhydrous ammonia has been demonstrated to op- erate successfully as a fuel for spark ignition engines. Principal requirements are that it be introduced in the vapor phase and partly decomposed to hydrogen and nitrogen. Spark timing for maximum perform- ance must be advanced slightly for ammonia but sen- sitivity to spark timing is little greater than with hy- drocarbons. Increasing the cylinder wall tempera- ture aids in effecting successful and reliable opera- tion. The maximum theoretically possible indicated output using ammonia vapor is about 77% of that with hydrocarbon. Specific fuel consumption in- creases twofold at maximum power and 2ƒº¬£ fold at maximum economy when using ammonia as a re- placement for hydrocarbon. Discussion: W. E.

Meckel, and R. D. Quillian, Jr., Southwest Res. Inst. This paper describes full-scale engine studies con- ducted to determine the feasibility and compata- bility of ammonia combustion in various systems. Briefly outlined is the spark-ignition investigation undertaken by the Army Laboratory to learn the po- tential and effect of ammonia as a fuel and to study the influence of engine variables on combustion. A study of compression-ignition performance was made to ascertain the ability of ammonia to be pumped in existing injection systems and various means of achieving ammonia combustion were ex- plored. Conclusions drawn from these studies on the use of ammonia as a fuel are given. Discussion: T. J. Pearsall, Continental Aviation and En- gineering Corp.; D. S. Gray, American Oil Co.; P. S.

This paper discusses a linkage analysis of the Jagjiar type C torque reactor, reducing linkage configura- tion to a simple distance ratio and providing for an additional link to assure directional stability during braking. The suspension described is of value to automobile builders who, for cost reasons, must use a solid, live rear axle, but wish to improve perform- ance through improvement in rear wheel adhesion with this simple four-bar linkage. 660159. Better Needle Bearings for Universal Joints. L. J. DiFrancesco, Torrington Co. In applying needle roller bearings to universal joints, it is desirable to identify and quantify several fac- tors, recognizing the interrelationship of these fac- tors in order to obtain the ultimate in successful per- formance and increased life. This paper discusses various aspects to be considered in bearing design (proportions and clearances); manufacturing toler- ances; use of different materials; and the importance of proper yoke and cross deflection, cross end play, cup grind relief and trunnion camfer, crowned races, and controlled contour rollers. 660160. Small Shaft, Radial Loads - Select the Right Bearing. H. Yarbrough, Kaydon Engrg. Corp. The shell type of radial needle bearings provides maximum antifriction capacity, while occupying generally the same space as plain bearing bushings, and fills a critical design need in larger and more complex machinery. Capacity, life, maintainability, and cost must be considered in the selection of the type of needle bearing in a particular application. This paper discusses its various applications. 660161. Polytropic Technique for Gas Turbine Performance Prediction and Evalua- tion. H. J. Wood, H. J. Wood &amp; Associates. The sophistication factor "S" is a number expressing deviations from isentropic operation of a gas turbine 84</page><page sequence="26">flow path due to gas dynamic effects. It may be used with remarkable accuracy in polytropic equations to analyze gas turbine cycle performance. When re- lated to statistics, it provides a means of evaluating proposed or existing engines with respect to current technology status. A corresponding technique for dealing with recuperators is also presented. 1967 SAE Transactions 660162. (SP-276) Objective Approach to High- way Truck Frame Design. W. J. Sidelko, Ford Motor Co. The design requirements for the frame as a load car- rying member are discussed in relationship to a high- way truck and its basic vehicle package. The theoret- ical and experimental procedures are given in detail to demonstrate the techniques for frame design. The features of a method to laboratory test a frame with correlation to service miles is discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660163. Ford Approach to Exhaust Emission Control. J. M. Chandler, J. H. Struck, and W. J. Voorheis, Ford Motor Co., Eng. and Foundry Div. A brief overall description of the Ford approach to the emission control problem is presented. Exhaust emission control development, vehicle development and testing, and details of the major Thermactor subsystems are covered. The Thermactor exhaust emission control system is composed of the following major parts: ‚Ä¢ Air pump, incorporating a relief valve ‚Ä¢ Air distribution manifolds with check valves ‚Ä¢ Cylinder head(s) with air injection tubes ‚Ä¢ Exhaust backfire suppressor valve ‚Ä¢ For some engines, revised distributors and car- buretors. The air inlet manifold distributes fresh air from the air pump to the individual exhaust ports in the cylinder head. The cylinder head with air injection tubes provides for the introduction of the air into the exhaust port near the exhaust valve seat. This lo- cation most efficiently mixes the exhaust gas and the air for effective burning. 660164. (SP-279) Visual Considerations: Man, the Vehicle, and the Highway - Part II. P. L. Connolly, Visual Consultant. The high-speed highway environment of today places great demands upon the physiological and perceptual capabilities of the driver's visual system. Suggestions for reducing accidents and fatalities on the road are offered from the standpoint that vision is the one common denominator in all the four ele- ments involved in highway safety - the vehicle op- erator, the vehicle itself, the highway, and the high- 660162-660169 way environment. Detailed aspects of these four im- portant factors are examined, and the results given of various studies to obtain more knowledge on human vision as related to vehicle and highway perform- ance.

A description is given of the technique used by FIAT, where three simple and economical methods for testing the complete car have been set up, namely, a static compression test, a dynamic test on catapult, and collision road tests of radio guided cars (con- trolled from other cars or from helicopters). The results are reciprocally integrating so as to give a thorough understanding of the behavior of several car models in collisions occurring in differ- ent ways and at different speeds. About 200 full- scale tests have been run so far and the results are in fair agreement with findings from actual road acci- dents. The information obtained has permitted pro- gressive design refinements, and has shown the way towards constructional improvements likely to in- crease car safety. 6601 66. Dual Usage of English and Metric Units. G. D. Mattison, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The fact that different countries use different dimen- sioning systems spurred the New Products Engin- eering Group of John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works to develop a system for interchangeability of parts in their factories. This paper discusses how the group undertook their assignment. 660167. Statistical Procedure for Predicting the Frequency of Extreme Loads. R. K. Brown, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The magnitude and frequency of extreme loads are essential to an accurate calculation of life when cumulative fatigue damage theories are employed. During field load measurements of limited duration, extreme loads are usually not encountered. The mag- nitude of extreme loads can be determined by abu- sive tests but this does not provide any information on their frequency. It has been found that normal op- eration loads usually conform to one of the many statistical distributions. By plotting normal operation loads on probability paper, the frequency of extreme loads can be estimated. 1967 SAE Transactions 660169. NASA's Role in Air Transportation. J. B. Parkinson, Office of Advanced Research and Technology, NASA. The mission of NASA in aeronautics is "to conduct 85</page><page sequence="27">660171-660177 research on the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution." The author in discussing the NASA mission, breaks it down into three major areas: advanced research, applied technology, and developmental technology. The discussion is based on specific aircraft. Among these are the V/STOL transports, the S ST, and hypersonic cruise vehicles. 660171. Turbine Powered Vehicle - Promises or Profit. G. W. Kahle, Deere and Co. Has the turbine engine progressed from an engineer- ing curiosity to a sophisticated powerplant capable of producing a profit for both the vehicle manufac- turer and the vehicle user? This paper discusses the answers to this question as related to off-highway in- dustrial vehicles of 600 hp or less in terms of such factors as thermodynamics, aerodynamic efficiency, and specific power. 1967 SAE Transactions 660172. Turbocharging Today and Tomorrow. G. Holzhausen, AiResearch Industrial Div., Garrett Corp. The mass production of turbochargers is a postwar industry primarily directed toward high speed vehi- cular diesel engines. The major product develop- ment and improvement have been concentrated in the p√°st ten years. Significant cost, weight, and size reductions have been achieved simultaneously with improvements in quality, reliability and perform- ance. Additional improvements in all those aspects can be expected for the future although not at such a rapid rate. 660173. Highly Compounded Two-Cycle Radial Light-Plant Engine. J. L. Dooley and J. W. Whittlesey, McCulloch Corp. This paper reviews the requirements, describes some of the unusual design features and character- istics, and presents the performance and weight data for the new McCulloch TSIR-5190 aircraft engine. This powerplant is a highly turbosupercharged, two- stroke cycle, direct fuel injection, liquid cooled, 5 cyl radial engine of 190 cu in. displacement. Maxi- mum rated horsepower is 270 at 3600 rpm, and the brake specific fuel consumption, over the range from half- to full-power, is below 0.5 lb/bhp-hr. The esti- mated "ready to fly" weight for the production en- gine is 365 lb. Some comparisons are made with cur- rently available engines. 1967 SAE Transactions 660174. (P-9) Nature and Intensity of Clear Air Turbulence. D. Colson, United States Weather Bureau. The phenomenon of clear air turbulence is reviewed indicating the role of wind shear, gravity waves, Richardson number and other indices in relation to turbulence intensity. Standard clear air turbulence intensity criteria are reviewed, including vertical accelerations, derived gust velocities, and airspeed fluctuations. Various descriptive criteria are re- viewed along with some newer concepts such as "chop." A panel has been established to up-date the current intensity criteria. A research flight program is now underway which will furnish a more complete understanding of clear air turbulence and a basis for a more quantitative set of intensity criteria. 660175. (P-9) Clear Air Turbulence: Problems and Solutions (A State-of-the-Art Re- port). E. R. Reiter, Dept. of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State Univ. A summary is given of the present state of knowledge on the physical causes of clear air turbulence. Spec- ial reference is made to recent measurements results from Project TOPCAT. Implications of these flight investigations, which were made over Australia, on remote sensing of clear air turbulence and on the planning of future research efforts are outlined. 660176. (P-9) Theory of Generation of Clear Air Turbulence. R. L. Moore, Douglas Air- craft Co., Inc.; and T. N. Krishnamurti, California Univ. and consultant, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. This paper presents additional information of a theo- retical nature and a synoptic case study concerning the nature of the generation of clear air turbulence. The hypothesis in this paper is that (a) shear is generated rapidly in a specific region of the atmos- phere; (b) the shear reaches a critical value and the flow becomes turbulent; and (c) the turbulent flow field, in the form of a cell or eddy, is carried away from the source region and gradually decays. The theory on which the prediction of shear is based is developed on a nonlinear basis to show that if convection of vorticity is neglected, the vertical component of the vorticity depends quadratically with time on the solenoids of temperature and diver- gence of velocity, plus another smaller term. Thus the horizontal shear of velocity may be expected in certain large scale synoptic situations to grow non- linearly. Synoptic analysis has been made by com- puter program of a well-known case of clear air tur- bulence: April, 1962. Data are presented comparing theory with observation of clear air turbulence. 6601 77. (P-9) Synoptic Analysis of Clear Air Tur- bulence. J. C. McLean, Jr., United States Navy Weather Research Facility. It is hypothesized that frontal surfaces between air 86</page><page sequence="28">masses of differing characteristics are the source of much of the clear air turbulence encountered by air- craft in the upper troposphere and lower stratos- phere. These fronts can be detected on detailed soundings as adiabatic zones of mixing and traced over geographic areas by isentropic analysis. 1967 SAE Transactions 660178. (P-9) Economic Aspects of Flight in Turbulence. J. Lederer, Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. This paper presents an initial attempt to estimate the economic effects of turbulence on airline opera- tions from the standpoint of costs of temporary grounding for inspections and repairs, cost of train- ing crews to cope with turbulence, the cost of dis- seminating information on turbulence, the cost of injuries sustained by passengers. The data was ob- tained from several airlines covering a wide geo- graphic area. The costs were difficult to ascertain because the accounting systems do not readily sep- arate the cost elements from several associated costs of operation. The information was extrapolated for all the major airlines to arrive at an estimate that turbulence costs about $6.00 per flight. 660180. (P.9) Clear Air Turbulence Detection and Warning. P. Rosenberg, Paul Rosen- berg Associates. Possible methods for the advance detection and warning of clear air turbulence by airborne devices are surveyed briefly. These include: active use of radar, microwaves, infrared and visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum; passive use of infra- red, millimeter waves and visible light; air tempera- ture probes; electric field measurements; electric charging of aircraft; ozone detection; and microbaro- metric measurements. The state of the art of clear air turbulence detection and warning is still explora- tory. No method has yet been demonstrated to give advance warning of clear air turbulence with a con- fidence level sufficient to justify operational use, and too little is known about the physical parameters of clear air turbulence to enable any one method of detection and warning to be singled out as the most promising. More basic research on the physics and meteorology of clear air turbulence itself is needed. 660181. (P-9) Exploration of the Relationship Between Atmospheric Temperature Change and Clear Air Turbulence. P. W. Kadlec, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. Certain atmospheric temperature changes have been observed to be a factor in detecting the occurrence of clear air turbulence, especially at jet altitudes above 25,000 ft. Data for this study were collected 660178-660184 on 146 flights during the year while riding as an ex- tra crew member in the cockpit of airline and mili- tary jet aircraft. The aircraft instrumentation in the research program included a portable test instru- ment to detect temperature changes as well as the normal components of an air data system and tem- perature sensors. A comparison between several rates of temperature change was made in an effort to determine which would indicate actual flight con- ditions most efficiently. From flight observations using the portable test instrument, a rate of tempera- ture change of 1.0¬∞C per minute was found to be the most useful criterion for correctly indicating flight conditions in the majority of cases. 660182. (P-9) Investigation of Techniques for Detecting Clear Air Turbulence. W. H. Paulsen, Air Force Cambridge Res. Labs. A review is made of the various approaches consid- ered in trying to develop an instrument capable of detecting clear air turbulence ahead of an aircraft. Because of the widespread regions in which clear air turbulence can occur and its often limited size, an airborne instrument is felt to be necessary to pro- vide the pilot with sufficiently accurate and timely data to permit appropriate action to be taken to mini- mize its effect on the aircraft. While progress has been understandably slow, the outlook is not as black as it was a few years ago and the interest and efforts of many more people plus advances in tech- nology enhance the possibilities of finding a solution to the clear air turbulence problem. 660183. (P-9) Clear Air Turbulence Research Programs of the Aerophysics Labora- tory. R. M. Endlich, S. M. Serebreny, and M. G. H. Ligda, Stanford Res. Inst. Research programs are discussed that concern the nature and causes of clear air turbulence; the prac- tical identification of turbulent regions by computer analysis of ordinary radiosonde measurements of winds, temperature, and pressure; the use of satel- lite photographs of clouds in turbulence analysis; determination of the climatology of clear air turbu- lence; and possible detection of layers that contain turbulence by means of lidar observations. 660184. (P-9) Correlation Between Clear Air Turbulence and Aircraft Electrical Ac- tivity. J. E. Nanevicz, E. F. Vance, and S. M. Serebreny, Stanford Res. Inst. The results of a cooperative effort by Stanford Re- search Institute, United Air Lines, and Air Force Cambridge Res. Labs, to determine the correlation between regions of clear air turbulence and aircraft electrical activity are described. Corona discharges 87</page><page sequence="29">660185-660189 from precipitation static discharges on DC-8 aircraft were monitored and correlated with clear air turbu- lence encounters. A significant correlation was found to exist between clear air turbulence encounters and periods of electrical discharge. It is suggested that these electrical discharges may be caused by electric fields in the region of clear air turbulence, particulate matter in the region that charges the air- craft, or a combination of both. The results of a mete- orological analysis of the regions where turbulence associated with electrical activity was observed in- dicated that the clear air turbulence incidents were of typical kinds that are associated with jet streams. 660185. (P-9) Low-Frequency Electrical Charac- teristics of Clear Air Turbulence. H. W. TenBroek and C. R. Seashore, Honey- well, Inc., Systems and Res. Div. The results of an investigation of the low frequency electrostatic field characteristics of clear air turbu- lence are presented. Brief descriptions are included of the general theory and practical aspects of the field sensing antennas used during the program and the electronic instrumentation used in data-gather- ing flights and subsequent data reduction. The data from a ridgeline turbulence encounter is analyzed with respect to frequency content in the decade bandwidths from 0.1 cps to 2000 cps. The results re- veal turbulence-generated signals in the 0.1-10.0 cps region which differ from pre- and post- encounter norms, presenting the possibility of anticipating the encounter. The direction of future effort is described. 660186. (P-9) Optimizing the Radar Detection of Clear Air Turbulence. D. Atlas and K. R. Hardy, Air Force Cambridge Res. Labs; and K. Naito, Northeastern Univ. An analysis is made of the spectrum of refractivity fluctuations in regions of clear air turbulence and of its radar reflectivity as a function of wave-length. The results are compared to the minimum detectable reflectivity of airborne radars having otpimum state of the art characteristics at each wavelength. It is shown that the best radars now feasible can barely detect the most reflective clear air turbulence at 10 na. mi. (i.e. 1 minute warning). A 20 db improvement in sensitivity is required for detection of most clear air turbulence, which appears to be just attainable by pre-detection integration. The optimum wavelength to implement is 5-6 cm. The best radar at this wave- length will also detect cirrus clouds reliably. Whe- ther detecting clouds, chaff, or direct clear air tur- bulence echoes, a measure of the echo fluctuation (or Doppler) spectrum is required to identify the intensity of clear air turbulence. It is also demon- strated that a ground-based forward-scatter link holds great promise for reliable clear air turbulence. 660187. (P-9) Radar Detection of Turbulence in the Upper Troposphere. W. E. Buehler and C. D. Lunden, Boeing Co. Encounters of jet aircraft with high altitude turbu- lence prompted the investigation of various tech- niques to probe and locate turbulence in areas lack- ing particles (rain drops, hail stones). A promising technique is to measure the radio refractive eddies and gradients by radar backscatter. Radio refractive index eddies can, in principle, be found where an atmosphere characterized by a non-adiabetic lapse rate of refractive index is stirred up by turbulence. This paper presents a sequence of VHF backscatter experiments which will hopefully lead up to an air- borne clear air turbulence detector. Described are: A cw bistatic backscatter experiment showing re- turns from turbulent volumes, a monostatic pulsed radar with returns from definite turbulent cells at various altitudes and an airborne experiment car- ried aboard a jetliner. The wavelength dependence of radar backscatter on the detectability of signifi- cant turbulent eddies is discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660188. (P-9) Results Applicable to Clear Air Turbulence Detection Using a Milli- meter Wave Radiometer Probe. W. D. Mount and B. R. Fow, Sperry Rand Res. Center. Millimeter wave emission from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere is investigated as a means for remote- ly measuring the ambient air temperature. Experi- mental results show that it is possible to obtain a re- mote measure of the temperature and temperature gradient. Temperature gradients typically associated with clear air turbulence are formulated in a model for computing radiometric temperatures that an in- flight remote sensor would detect. These results show that a millimeter wave radiometric system could be used more effectively than a direct tem- perature measuring system to provide a more reli- able and earlier warning of impending clear air tur- bulence. 1967 SAE Transactions 660189. (P-9) Remote Detection of Clear Air Turbulence by Means of Airborne In- frared Instruments. E. M. Wormser, Barnes Engrg. Co. Air temperature gradients are frequently associated with clear air turbulence. Radiation measuring in- struments have already been used for the remote sensing of air temperature. A suitably-designed in- strument should give adequate warning of turbu- lence regions ahead and provide an opportunity for their avoidance. A spectral scanning infrared radio- meter has been designed for this purpose and is des- 88</page><page sequence="30">cribed in this paper. Extensive ground tests have been conducted, including making atmospheric temperature analyses in horizontal and vertical di- rections. Mountaintop tests are being planned and airborne tests will follow. Detection ranges of 25 miles are anticipated. 660190. (P-9) Airborne Laser Radar Investiga- tions of Clear Air Turbulence. P. A. Franken, J. A. Jenney, and D. M. Rank, Michigan Univ. The airborne experiments reported in this paper were initiated to explore the possibility that charac- teristic optical radar echoes might actually be cor- related with clear air turbulence. A light twin en- gine airplane (Army L-23D) was equipped with a laser radar and ancillary equipment for monitoring acceleration, temperature variations, and relevant meteorological data. The design of this equipment and the development of the flight programs were predicated on theoretical considerations of optical scattering from particulate matter. A detailed dis- cussion of the theory, together with descriptions of the actual equipment, are contained in a report by the authors that has been prepared at the University of Michigan. The present paper will confine itself to the conclusions that we have reached in the ex- periments that have been conducted throughout 1965. 660191. (P.9) Advanced Optical Radar System for Atmospheric Studies. L. G. Cross, Lear-Siegler, Inc. A scanning optical radar system for meterological studies is briefly described. The techniques of ob- taining efficient, high pulse repetition rates from a ruby laser, scanning the transmitter and receiver beams, and the operation of the B scope area dis- play are discussed. 660192. (P-9) Remote Measurement of Differ- ential Atmospheric Velocity. R. C. Breece, D. L. Fried, and J. B. Seidman, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. A concept for detection of clear air turbulence utiliz- ing the Doppler frequency shift in laser light back- scattered from atmospheric aerosol is described. The concept employs detection of beat frequencies in the output current of a photodetector resulting from photo mixing the backscattered light from two laser pulses illuminating separated volumes of air. Analysis of the spectral and coherence properties of scattered light is given which proves that the basic phenomena exists. The realizability of a practical system depends upon sufficient aerosol densities 660190-660196 and higher performance lasers to achieve adequate S/N at useful distances. 660193. (P-9) Early Warning of Clear Air Tur- bulence by Photometric Measurements. J. Greene, S. Roberto, and M. Le win- stein, Kollsman Instrument Corp. This paper with techniques of photometric measure- ments of starlight variations which propagate along a line of sight coincident with the flight profile of a jet aircraft. Thus, a clear air turbulence "volume" intersecting this flight path may be detected at some prior point in time and compared to nonturbulent measurements. A star tracker will produce informa- tion which by statistical processing will establish a threshold for advanced warning of clear air turbu- lence. Recommendations are presented for night time feasibility tests to be made with operational hardware under controlled conditions. Daytime tests requiring the measurement of weak bodies in high ambient conditions pose severe problems. 660194. (P-9) Airline Practices in Forecasting Clear Air Turbulence. J. J. George, East- ern Air Lines, Inc. The flight problems of clear air turbulence are brought into focus. The forecast problem is reviewed and airline practices in forecasting are described. It is demonstrated that adding the requirement of an axis of minimum temperature at levels from 300 to 200 mb reduces the average forecast box appreciably as well as adding accuracy. A practical forecast pro- cedure is suggested. 660195. (P-9) Minimizing the Effects of Moun- tain Waves and Shear Generated Clear Air Turbulence in Airline Operations. W. B. Beckwith, United Air Lines, Inc. The development of techniques employed by the airlines in overcoming the problem of clear air tur- bulence is outlined. Improvement in transport air- craft brought new sets of challenges in this area which were overcome by applied meteorological studies conducted by the airlines and assisted by military and government research. A distinction is made in the methods of bypassing the turbulence re- gions caused by wind shear and those caused by the mountain wave. A new study on mountain wave tur- bulence evasion showing considerable promise is discussed. Recommendations are made on methods for keeping pace with an increasing exposure to this important operational problem. 660196. (P-9) Analysis of Clear Air Turbulence Incidents. M. G. Beard, Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. Analysis of turbulence incidents since 1959 indicates 89</page><page sequence="31">660197-660202 that the record could have been much better if a good clear air turbulence detector had been available. A device which defines clear air turbulence areas and indicates the degree of turbulence could be more ex- act than weather radar is in indicating storm areas. This paper briefly summarizes the turbulence inci- dents during the last six years and discusses the causes of some of the more severe ones. 660197. (P-9) Pilot Technique in Turbulence. J. B. Clark, American Airlines, Inc. Clear air turbulence and thunderstorm turbulence are compared. The flight technique to be used is the same in all turbulence. Upsets in thunderstorm tur- bulence are discussed. Years ago there was evidence of a clear pattern in the upsets involving propeller driven airplanes. There was heavy airplane nose down elevator use following a violent updraft with eventual recovery from a deep dive. A similar pitch axis pattern is apparent in jet upsets. The swept wing jet has different stability characteristics; has a motor driven horizontal stabilizer as well as an ele- vator to control around the pitch axis; has improved flight instrumentation. Pilot training and a stabilizer modification have contributed to a dramatic decline in incident reports. 660198. (P-9) Feasibility of Optical Radar to Detect Clear Air Turbulence. R. E. Zirkle, Jr., Honeywell Inc. Pulsed ruby laser optical radars were used to exam- ine the feasibility of turbulence detection in labora- tory test chambers and afield. Many returns obtained showed evidence of particle concentration varia- tions, but none were identified as interactions with either turbulence or correlates of rough flying. Cal- culations and recently reported experimental evi- dence show that c-w laser doppler optars might even- tually measure wind velocity components and gust spectra. 660199. D-C Electric Drive for Off-Highway Ve- hicles. R. W. Volpe, General Elee. Co. D-C electric drive systems have demonstrated to users of off highway vehicles unmatched perform- ance and provided materials haulage at unprece- dented savings in total cost per ton moved. It is ap- propriate to discuss these drive systems and estab- lish the parameters which made them of such unique value to the vehicle user. The application of electric drive to off-highway vehicles requires a knowledge of the vehicle mechanics, the engine power avail- able and the electrical characteristics of the drive components to provide a well balanced unit. Proper- ly designed and built electric drive vehicles in wide spread use in the toughest off-highway mining and materials handling service are out-performing the best in torque converter-multiple gear shift drives which have been matched with them in the language which is most important to the user: total cost per ton moved. 660200. Problem Analysis and Decision-Making. A. R. Kluckner, British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority. This paper provides a brief introduction to the man- agement function of problem analysis and decision- making. It reduces to the essentials the actual steps involved in identifying problems and finding solu- tions for them, and does this in a framework corre- lated with the bases of business policy, objectives, and managerial functions. Actually, it is intended to be a capsule revi√©w of a minimum training course in this important subject. 660201 . Changing Concepts of Automatic Flight. K. Frudenfeld, Brittain Industries, Inc. In a search for hardware to be used for automatic stabilization for aircraft it appears that a sensor-servo system to control the roll axis would be the most sig- nificant. Actually, today's aircraft are relatively stable in respect to pitch and yaw. As a matter of fact, dis- orientation rarely results in drastic changes of atti- tude in respect to pitch and yaw, unless preceded by deviation on the roll axis. Sensor-servo means to control the roll axis have been incorporated in a num- ber of these general aviation type aircraft. Some of these systems are the Piper AutoControl, the Cess- namatic 200, the Mooney "PC," and the Beech Con- stant Copilot. All of the above utilize a gyro sensor. Attempts to develop sensor means, other than gyros, have been numerous over a period of decades. De- vices, depending upon differential pressures and pendulums, have been generally unsatisfactory as a result of the relatively low threshold provided by such means. It appears, therefore, that present day hardware must incorporate a gyroscopic sensor. If a stabilization system is to incorporate a gyro sensor, it would appear fundamental that the output of the gyroscopic device remain entirely redundant and separate from the gyro flight instruments. The mal- function of an instrument providing both visual atti- tude reference and stabilization, or autopilot inputs, obviously creates a dilemma. On the other hand, an aircraft stabilized by independent gyro and operated by a pilot capable of maintaining orientation by ref- erence to an attitude display, would present the greatest margin of safety. 660202. Cessna Model 210 Hydraulic System and Its Development. A. K. Mabe, Cess- na Aircraft Co. 90</page><page sequence="32">Current hydraulic system on the Cessna model 210 aircraft and some of the problems encountered dur- ing its development are presented. Several cross-sec- tion views of the various components are illustrated, along with a schematic of the system, to aid in ex- plaining how the necessary sequencing is accomp- lished with a combination of electrically and hydrau- lically controlled sequencing devices. In view of the demands made of the system, it is a practical, reason- ably simple, and reliable light aircraft landing gear retraction system. 660203. Adapting the Automotive Alternator to the Light Commercial Airplane Envir- onment. H. L. Wise, Cessna Aircraft Co., Commercial Aircraft Div. The self-rectifying automotive-type alternator is being modified for light airplane usage. The alter- nator is rapidly replacing the conventional d-c gen- erator in light commercial airplanes because of its greater output at low speeds, weight savings, simpli- city of control, and eventual cost savings. The change from d-c generator to self-rectifying alternators has required that the airplane's electrical system and ac- cessories also be modified to accept the inherent electrical "noise" developed by the self-rectifying alternator. These first applications of the automotive alternator are the beginning of a series of electrical system improvements that lie ahead for the industry. 1967 SAE Transactions 660204. Cessna Aircraft Commercial Division Quality Control Program. G. R. Biggs, Cessna Aircraft Co., Commercial Aircraft Div. The philosophies and methods used in the quality and reliability programs of the leading manufacturer of business and personal aircraft are given. The per- sonnel involved are numerous and range from trainee to scientist covering every basic modern sci- ence except the most exotic ones. While the activities are not radical, they do represent practical refine- ments of techniques which have been proved by re- sults. 660205. Practical Data Processing Approach for Achieving Effective Management Control of Aircraft Manufacture. B. Gebhardt, Mooney Aircraft, Inc. Continued prosperity in the aircraft industry can lead to costly inefficiencies. Management is using data processing to offset these inefficiencies but many applications are only partially effective. This paper reviews a system application at Mooney Air- craft, Inc., that was developed from "ideal" operat- ing concepts. The theory behind the system develop- 660203-660208 ment is outlined and the critical control procedures and objective operating results achieved are identi- fied. 1967 SAE Transactions 660206. Production "Within the State of the Art" for High Subsonic Aerodynamics. L. Bush, Rockwell-Standard Corp., Aero Commander Div. With the advent of business jet aircraft that operate at high subsonic speeds, Aero Commander has, in the absence of newer, "tested and proved" tech- niques of construction, adapted conventional sheet metal methods to meet the requirements of high- speed aerodynamics. Special techniques have been developed for handling "skins" to prevent surface marring and to insure smooth butt joints. Chem- milled skins are employed for weight reduction, fail- safe requirements and aerodynamic smoothness. Manufacturing processes have been devised for pro- duction of single-piece, compound-curved sheet metal parts so that one piece replaces several that would be used in conventional production. Toler- ances in fitting are more exacting. Various tech- niques, such as rivet head shaving, are used to pro- duce aerodynamically clean surfaces. These tech- niques and their relationship to production time and costs are presented. 660207. Current and Possible Future Trends in Oxygen Equipment and Usage. A. E. Miller, Scott Aviation Corp. The importance of oxygen in our environment is briefly reviewed, and a number of potential future developments which might result in radically dif- ferent oxygen storage and distribution systems in aircraft are described and discussed. 660208. Application of Vapor-Cycle Cooling Systems to Business Aircraft. G. R. Whit- nah and R. D. Mills, Litton Systems, Inc. In recent years, vapor-cycle cooling systems have been used widely on airliners and are currently of- fered on some business aircraft. Several aircraft man- ufacturers are now studying the incorporation of va- por-cycle systems in their new business. In an inde- pendent research and development program, the Applied Science Division of Litton Systems, Inc. has developed a vapor-cycle air conditioning system designed to the requirements of this class of aircraft. Minimum power consumption consistent with reas- onable weight and volume is considered extremely important. Compatibility with ventilation or pres- surization systems is also an important design con- sideration. Test results are given for a range of oper- ating speeds. 91</page><page sequence="33">660209-660216 660209. Development of Air Conditioning in Beech Airplanes. L. B. Clay, Beech Air- craft Corp. A general discussion of the problems involved in introducing air conditioning in small executive air- craft. The discussion includes: (1) early studies and hardware for "add on" package units, (2) system sel- ection studies for small pressurized turbine powered aircraft, (3) system design including structural changes required, (4) testing, development and serv- ice experience on the Beech King Air cooling sys- tem and (5) other applications and possible future development trends. 660210. Economics of Business Aircraft. H. W. Ryan, Beech Aircraft Corp. The economics of business aircraft as a tool of in- dustry is examined in the context of the interests of: 1. The airplane salesman whose task it is to define a need which may not be readily apparent to the prospect. 2. The prospective purchaser whose interest in aircraft economics is presumed to be contained in the economics of his business. 3. The aircraft owner who seeks to obtain produc- tive use of his airplane as he does other tools and equipment. 6602 1 3. Support Breeds Success and Successors. H. J. Schoenenberg, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. The days have passed when a manufacturer of cor- porate aircraft can limit his marketing efforts to the aircraft itself. Chief pilots and transportation man- agers must now be able to predict support costs and, in fact, insure their corporate officers that adequate support is, or will be, available. In the past, the ini- tial cost of an aircraft was the primary consideration of the potential buyer. Support was generally a hit or miss effort with spares bought from surplus stock or commercial suppliers. With the introduction of sophisticated turbine-powered aircraft designed spe- cifically to meet corporate requirements, support has become a mandatory consideration. It can no longer be assumed; it must be guaranteed! A corpor- ate aircraft without a support program guaranteed by the manufacturer will, in a short period of time, be- come an unjustified luxury rather than a useful cor porate tool. Maximum availability is a must which can only be economically attained by a complete support system. This presentation deals with the many aspects of a modern support program which must be considered by both the manufacturer and the operators of the aircraft. It shows that support of corporate aircraft is an accurate and demanding busi- ness unlike anything devised for airline or military systems. 660214. Birdproofing the Sabreliner. C. W. King, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. Birdproofing the cockpit of the high-performance North American Sabreliner involved "shooting" 4- pound birds at the windshields at speeds up to 350 knots, in order to qualify for a Transport Category Type Certificate. A description of the test proce- dure and results is given for the five basic transpar- ent areas requiring qualification. The function of heating the vinyl interlayer related to its birdproof- ing, defogging, and anti-icing requirements is des- cribed. Data of tests by Civil Aeronautics Adminis- tration is compared with Sabreliner test points. 660215. Defining the Fatigue Load Environ- ment for Business Aircraft. C. M. Thompson, Lear Jet Corp. Load environments for general aviation and business aircraft have not been a matter of concern in the past, except for static strength purposes. Increased recog- nition of the importance of fatigue qualification must be accompanied by an examination of how these air- craft are being used. The approach suggested here is a simplification of that used by the transport aircraft industry. Examinations of the gust and maneuver load environments are made relative to different types of flight operations. Ground-air-ground cycles, cabin pressurization, and landing load experiences are also examined. 1967 SAE Transactions 660216. Design and Development of the Struc- tural Integrity of a Jet Executive, D.H. 125. B. A. Noble, Hawker Siddeley Avia- tion, Ltd. The paper deals first with the pedigree of the D.H. 125 and then with the background decisions affect- ing the design and design aims, such as probable flight plans and utilization. The choice of materials and the construction formulae to achieve these aims are then discussed. The philosophy of thorough an- alysis backed by comprehensive testing is pro- pounded and the view taken that the right place for trouble to be discovered is on specimens in the lab- oratory and not on aircraft in service. There is dis- cussion of the difficult task of how and when to test to maximum advantage, bearing in mind the desire to demonstrate the three departments of static load- ing, repeated loading, and fail safety. The highlights of experience in this field are then described as they have affected the development of the structural in- tegrity of the D.H. 125 and a rundown on some test programs of major components used to illustrate the achievements. 92</page><page sequence="34">660217. FAA Research, Development, and Air- worthiness Compliance for General Av- iation Aircraft. W. H. Weeks and H. D. Hoekstra, Federal Aviation Agency. Aeronautical safety research and development work can provide a substantial contribution to the im- provement in airworthiness standards and safety. Six representative Federal Aviation Agency research and development projects are described and the procedures employed to establish and conduct the work are outlined. 660218. Development and Flight Testing a Sim- plified Fixed Shaft Turboprop Flight Control System. V. Johnson, J. R. Baker, and J. W. Massey, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona, Div., Garrett Corp. Adaptation of fixed shaft turboprop engines to busi- ness and utility aircraft requires drastic simplifica- tion of the control system as compared to transport turboprops. The AiResearch TPE331 engine incor- porates a variable low pitch stop controlled thru mechanical linkage to achieve both simplified con- trol and also reverse thrust. Control of the system utilizes a cam cut to match airplane-engine-propel- ler flight characteristics. Flight testing in aircraft varying from a converted B-26 test bed to slow STOL aircraft was used to verify calculations and develop control system, negative torque system and general engine development. 660219. Evaluation of General Aviation Aircraft Flying Qualities. M. R. Barber, F. W. Haise, and C. K. Jones, Flight Research Center, NASA. The flying qualities of six late-model personal-own- er aircraft are generally satisfactory for operation in visual-flight environment. During instrument flight, particularly in the presence of turbulence, the flying qualities of these aircraft are such that excessive pilot effort is required to perform precise tracking tasks such as instrument landing system approaches. A correlation between pilot workload and stability and control characteristics indicates that improved characteristics would alleviate much of the effort required of the pilot. A method of quantitatively evaluating the effect of individual stability and con- trol characteristics on the pilot workload is needed. 660220. Effect of a Light Aircraft Stability Aug- mentation System on Pilot Performance. N. R. Driscoll, Langley Research Center, NASA. A simple wings-leveling device for light aircraft, and the effect of his device on the instrument flight per- formance of non-instrument qualified private pilots 660217-660223 were evaluated. Experienced research pilots found overall system performance acceptable. However, slightly lower rate capability and slightly higher con- trol forces than desired were present. Non-instru- ment qualified private pilots were provided with an increased capability to recover from an inadvertent instrument flight situation. Limited navigation and communication tasks, beyond the capability of the pilot while controlling the basic aircraft, could be performed with system aid. Control wheel force de- veloped by the system as a function of bank angle in a steady turn was found to be a definite instrument flight aid. 660221. Application of the High Bypass Turbo- fan for Business and Executive Aircraft. L. R. I'Anson, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. The future market potential of business executive jet aircraft based on an extrapolation of the current market is discussed together with a definition of the overall requirements of this type of airplane. Mission performance of a representative executive jet trans- port, comparing a pure jet engine propulsion system with fan engines of various bypass ratio shows that a bypass ratio of about 6:1 provides the best overall solution over the mission spectrum considered. Fea- tures of Avco Lycoming's PLF Series fan engines are discussed in relation to the requirements for a business executive jet airplane. 660222. New Generation of General Aircraft Engine Mountings. R. A. John and E. J. Straneva, Lord Mfg. Co., Div., Lord Corp. Modern airplanes use engine mountings which are very soft compared to similar engine installations of only five years ago. Soft mountings provide better attenuation of engine-induced vibrations and lower cabin vibration levels. The penalty paid for less vi- bration is large engine motions during starting and stopping which must be controlled. One such motion control device is discussed in the paper. The effi- ciency of engine mountings is usually reduced by modern lightweight flexible mount structures. Soft mountings can decrease the influence of mount structures on suspension systems. 660223. Jet Pump as a Fuel Pump for Today's Aircraft. R. L. Klapprott and L. D. Smith, Lear Jet Corp. The use of jet pumps in aircraft fuel systems has at- tracted considerable attention in the past few years. This paper discusses the jet pump development pro- gram conducted on the Lear Jet Model 24, 8-passen- ger executive jet, and the 28-passenger Model 40 jet transport. Also discussed are the results of exten- sive laboratory testing of jet pumps. The data is pre- 93</page><page sequence="35">660224-660232 sented in a manner that will assist designers of jet pump systems in sizing jet pumps with a minimum of laboratory testing. 1967 SAE Transactions 660224. Elephant Power on a Shoestring. K. C. Custer, Gates Rubber Co. This paper reviews a new cast polyurethane V-belt using a 60 deg sheave angle system representing a new concept in belts. It discusses trends in engine design influencing belt drives - higher accessory loads, needs for compactness, cost reduction, and longer warranties. It explains how this belt meets future needs through higher capacities, smaller cross sections, higher coefficient of friction, and greater manufacturing uniformity. It gives the background for the selection of a 60 deg angle system and shows, with graphs and line drawings, each advantage built into the belt drive. It discusses a time-life design concept available to the engineer designing V-belt drives. 660225. Acro-Set: A New Method For Installa- tion of Tapered Roller Bearings with Accurate End-Play Setting. R. F. Corn- ish, Timken Roller Bearing Co. Making use of the elastic deflection of an assembly to set tapered roller bearings with end play is a new ap- plication of a time proven method of setting bearings with preload. The technique offers a simple method for accurate bearing setting with a minimum of tools, is adaptable to both loose and tight fitted bearing parts. 660226. Powershift Transmissions Featuring Variable Capacity Converter. R. L. Black, Allison Div., G.M.C. The variable capacity converter feature in power- shift transmissions eliminates performance compro- mise in applications having multiple power require- ments similar to the elevator scraper. With the capa- bility of shifting converter capacity, maximum per- formance is obtained for each phase of operation, thus providing optimum vehicle performance. 660227. Fairbanks Morse Model 50 Range of High Speed Diesel Engines. T. Lancas- ter, Fairbanks Morse Inc. This paper describes the design, construction, and performance features of two ranges of compact, high specific output diesel engines designed for station- ary, mobile, and marine applications, and capable of operation in severe climatic or service conditions. The description also shows how design simplicity and maximum interchangeability of components have been combined to ensure easy maintenance. 660228. The Caterpillar 100-Ton Electric Drive Truck. R. H. Kress, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Design features of the 100 ton electric drive truck developed by Caterpillar are discussed. Salient fea- tures of this vehicle are its power-weight ratio which is equal to or better than many small vehicles, and its maneuverability which enables it to turn within a 52 ft SAE circle. Two additional items mentioned are the use of electric power for smooth shifting of the vehicle and oil-cooled friction brakes for control of the truck under any stopping or retarding require- ment. Present testing indicates this vehicle will make a worth-while contribution to the better hand- ling of construction material. 660230. Fuel Cells - Present Status and Develop- ment Problems. T. G. Kirkland and D. J. Looft, Army Engineer Research and De- velopment Laboratories. The approaches being taken at the U.S. Army En- gineer Research and Development Laboratories at Ft. Belvoir, to develop fuel cell power plants for United States Army application which utilize hydro- gen derived from liquid hydrocarbons and oxygen from ambient air, are reviewed. Four systems are being investigated: Direct Oxidation, Internal Re- forming, External Reforming and Partial Oxidation - Molten Carbonate. Use of other more special fuels such as hydrazine and ammonia for special applica- tion is also discussed. The major problem areas com- mon to all systems are electrode reliability and noise, weight, and reliability of auxiliary components. The fuel cell power plant power density that has to be achieved to replace internal combustion engines in vehicles is between 10 and 13 lb per kw. With the present rate of progress, this power density is not overly optimistic for the 1980 time frame. 660231. Concept and Design: LW 120 Electric Haulpak. W. D. Cashman, LeTourneau- Westinghouse Co. The LW120A, announced late in 1965, is the largest off-highway, two-axle truck manufactured to date. It employs new engine powerplants in the 1000-hp range and transmits this power via a d-c electric drive system. This paper briefly describes the product planning which led to the basic concept, and dis- cusses the main design areas and their design criteria. 660232.

From recent nuclear excavation research come ex- perimental data and theoretical techniques which can be used to design the excavation of an Isth- 94</page><page sequence="36">mian sea-level canal by means of nuclear explosions. Preliminary designs have been made for routes in the Darien region of eastern Panama and the Choco region of northwest Colombia. While there are im- portant uncertainties, the outlook is promising for demonstrating the technical feasibility of the pro- ject, its safety, and its economy compared to conven- tional construction of a sea-level canal in the vicin- ity of the present Panama Canal. 1967 SAE Transactions 660233. Computerized Excavation. J. F. Seger, Groves IS. J.I and Sons Co. The challenge of change in technology is taxing the ingenuity of contractors and managers, forcing them to use all the modern techniques available to them. The first section of this paper examines excavating with a scraper. It discusses planned replacement of equipment, preventive maintenance, selection of the correct hauling unit, analysis of operation efficiency, and over pushing. The second portion introduces space age mathematics to the excavating operation. By use of the computer, it is possible to simulate the haul characteristics of various types and makes of equipment, and the drill and blast requirements of rock projects.

Edwin Burks, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper discusses world needs for improvements in transportation; better water cQntrol and conserva- tion; more airfields; more modern highway systems; more housing; urban renewal; more food and fiber; better railway systems; greater tonnage of basic ma- terials mined and processed; and greater acreage of marginal lands reclaimed for agricultural purposes. It describes earthmoving developments that will en- able the industry to meet this challenge. Specifically covered are productivity advances; increased output from smaller, lighter engines; time improvements; increased use of hydraulics; and lighter, stronger, and more abrasion-resistant materials. Also, ad- vances in transmissions, power trains, clutches and brakes, ride control, seals, and turbochargers. 660236. Construction and Earthmoving Equip- ment Requirements in Vietnam. Frank Milner, Army Engr. Res. and Dev. Labs. The engineer troops in Vietnam have had to cope with a number of problems caused by the rapid buildup of troops, the complexity and wide variety of equipment in use, and the resulting high level of 660233-660273 skill required of operator and maintenance person- nel. This paper describes some of the equipment and procedures developed by U.S. Army Engr. Res. and Dev. Labs, for ease of assembly and mainten- ance, including the sectionalizing of vehicles. The author also outlines maintenance problems encoun- tered in the field, particularly on hydraulic systems and the overall problems of quality control. 660237. 110-Ton Payload on Two Axles with Hydro-Mechanical Drive. Murray Ait- ken, KW-Dart Truck Co. Late developments in tires and in lightweight, high horsepower engines and transmissions have enabled the earthmoving and mining industry equipment manufacturers to design and produce several types of preproduction 100-ton capacity trucks. A straight- forward approach to the design of a 110-ton end dump truck on two axles with a hydromechanical drive was followed by KW-Dart Truck Co. to produce a low cost per ton-mile vehicle. 660238. New Era in Controllability- Hydrosta- tic Steering for Articulated Vehicles. B. C. Hudgens and R. L. Goff, Ross Gear Div., TRW Inc. With the advent of ever larger mobile machines in the earthmoving industry new methods of steering control had to be developed. Three basic systems which had sufficed in the past were mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic power steering mechan- isms. This paper describes a new hydrostatic power steering system which appears particularly applic- able to large off-road construction machines. Basic features of the V2 Hydraguide system are discussed. It is believed this system meets the general require- ments for a high-flow steering unit and represents a new era in controllability for articulated vehicles. 660273. Pilot9¬ª Summary of XB-70 Flight Test Experience. A. S. White, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The XB-70, the most advanced manned airplane being flown today, weighs over 500,000 lb at take- off and is capable of speeds up to 2000 mph at 70,000 ft. Innovations of folding wing tips, a variable geom- etry air inlet duct, and elevons have been incorpor- ated into the design for the control of an air vehicle of this size, weight, and speed/altitude envelope. These innovations have made flying this air vehicle a new experience. This paper summarizes this expe- rience in actual flight testing, and includes informa- tion gained in the low-speed regimes as well as in high Mach number flights. 1967 SAE Transactions 95</page><page sequence="37">660274-660281 660274. XB-70A Mach 3 Design and Operating Experience. W. A. Spivak, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The XB-70A represents the most advanced example of the evolution and technological advances of manned aircraft in the past decade. It is, in effect, the forerunner of SST type aircraft and in itself is respon- sible for many items or features that have been sub- sequently embodied in contemporary military air- craft. This paper describes the unique aerodynamic concepts and configuration of the XB-70A and its airborne systems. Results of the current flight test program are summarized along with discussions on "gremlin" areas during fabrication and flight test- ing, and how they were or are being solved. Ex- amples of improvements in air vehicle No. 2 as a re- sult of air vehicle No. 1 experience are presented, in- cluded a summary of major system reliability demon- strated during the flight test program as an indicator of the potential refinements in cost and performance possible for future large high-speed aircraft. 1967 SAE Transactions 660275. XB-70 Ground Servicing and Safety Precautions. R. M. Roper, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Planning for good servicing and maintenance started in the proposal phase and has been followed by test program experience with the XB-70 Mach 3 air ve- hicle. Servicing and associated safety requirements are summarized. Discussion of maintenance and sup- port actions includes mention of equipment pro- vided to meet the requirements. Preflight, postflight, and periodic operations are outlined* along with some indication of changes that resulted when plans were put into practice. The demands of a high per- formance flight test air vehicle limit movements toward simplification. 660276. XB-70A Laboratory for Progress. G. Stroh, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The development of the XB-70 research aircraft pro- duced advancements in many fields of technology. This paper covers a few of these advancements in the areas of materials, equipment, and manufactur- ing. These include honeycomb construction, PH 15-7 alloy steel, vacuum melted H-ll steel, equip- ment capable of withstanding high temperatures, chemical milling of many different alloys, minia- turized welding equipment, and exothermic brazing techniques. 660277. Design Importance of Airplane Mile Costs versus Seat Mile Costs. C. P. Autry and P. J. Baumgaertner, Boeing Co., Air- plane Div. It is shown that the airplane design factors affecting direct operating cost may be isolated into two major categories: (1.) airplane size, and (2.) technology and configuration. In the first category the effect of design payload and design range on airplane mile and seat mile costs, profit potential, and productivity are dis- cussed. The airline planning factors of traffic den- sity, frequency and load factor are shown to have the principal influence on airplane size. In the second category, the effects of technology and/or configuration differences on direct operating cost are shown as factors independent of airplane size. 660279. Factors Affecting Utilization. W. G. Kal- dahl, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. Aircraft utilization is affected by numerous factors. It is also influenced by all phases of an airline opera- tion. Although frequently established as an objec- tive, it is more realistically a result of the plans de- veloped. The intent of this paper is to highlight and discuss some of the more meaningful factors which affect utilization, from the vantage point of a sched- ule planner, with the view that knowledge of their existence may contribute to appropriate solutions. 660280. ATA Direct Operating Cost Formula for Transport Aircraft. E. L. Thomas, Air Transport Association. Estimation of aircraft operating expense for airline operation is becoming increasingly complex. The ATA Standard Method of Estimating Comparative Direct Operating Costs of Transport Airplanes, last reviewed in 1960, is again under study for revision. When revised it should provide a more useable tool to the industry in analyzing the economics of compe- titive aircraft. Although considerably refined it will necessarily retain most of the limitations of the pres- ent edition - limitations that are inherent in any standardized method of this nature. 660281. Effects of the Super Sixty Series DC-8 on Airport Requirements. R. E. Black, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. A welcome relief to airport runway, taxiway, gate position saturation, and air traffic congestion is of- fered by the new Super Sixty Series DC-8, which now carries twice as many passengers per flight. Air- plane operators benefit from substantially lower di- rect operating costs per seat-mile and more efficient utilization of pilot manpower in an area of growing shortage. These airplanes have a special family of problems in common with earlier jets, including community annoyance caused by noise, runway strength limitations, and the requirement for an in- crease in terminal people and baggage handling equipment. 96</page><page sequence="38">660282. Super Airport Planning. R. F. Ziegen- filder and W. H. Wilkinson, Jr., Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade &amp; Douglas. The rapid growth of commercial air transportation has forced many of the nation's major airports into early obsolescence. In most cases, this could have been prevented if planners had provided sufficient flexibility for expansion to meet changing demands and to accommodate increasing volumes of passen- ger and cargo movements. Two super airport con- cepts which provide this flexibility - the satellite and the unit terminal - are discussed in this paper. 660283. Flight Operations on a Circular Run- way. Com. L. H. Smith, Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility, Navy Dept. Inherent advantages of an infinitely long runway, op- timum terminal location at the center of the circle, and safety enhancement by increased directional stability during aircraft ground roll generated inter- est in the circular runway concept. The Bureau of Naval Weapons originated a project to determine, within the realm of aircraft behavior, the feasibility of flight operations from a circular runway. Utiliz- ing an existing circular track at the General Motors Proving Ground near Mesa, Arizona, tests were con- ducted with a T28, an Al-E, and A4-B, and a C54. It was determined that pilots readily adapt to opera- tions from a circular runway, that aircraft lateral and directional stability is more positive than on a flat runway, that tangential approaches are no more dif- ficult than approaches to a straight runway, and that low visibility approaches are much simpler than to a straight runway. Flight operations from a circular runway are feasible. 1967 SAE Transactions 660284. Airport Planning- Past, Present, and Future. A. E. Blomquist, A. E. Blomquist and Associates. The ever expanding growth of the eastern seaboard megalopolis presents major problems in the planning of airports to serve the area efficiently. This paper reviews past experience and future needs of the Washington - Philadelphia - New York - Boston area. Discussed in detail is the planning for the airports, with connecting arterial highway and rail transporta- tion. The author concludes that the metropolitan re- gion must be totally planned to preserve the balance of residential, business, and industrial development with sufficient open spaces, and that airports must be a major part of such planning. 660285. Government Attitudes, Interests and Expectations in Industrial Readiness. E. Bennewitz, Office of Assistant Secre- tary of Defense, Defense Dept. 660282-660287 Industrial readiness planning encompasses a num- ber of diverse activities involving varying degrees of industry/government input. This paper outlines contractor or government actions which permit quick response to unforeseen production demands. The author discusses production planning with industry; maintenance of stand-by facilities; maintenance of production facilities in "package plants" for use in an emergency; modernization of industrial equipment; use of priorities and allocation controls; material stockpiling; and financial assistance for mobiliza- tion planning. The Defense Dept. is continuing its efforts to improve government/industry production planning programs and to weld the various programs into a cohesive package. 660286. Readiness and Contingency Planning of External Resources. J. P. McCarthy, Lockheed-Georgia Co. A program for readiness and contingency planning of external resources for the aerospace industry must of necessity be accomplished within the framework of the Defense Materials System, which controls the supply of copper, aluminum, and steel. This system, a simplified form of the former Controlled Materials Plan, was established in anticipation of such an em- ergency as exists in the world today. The Defense Materials System helps ensure first, that defense programs are maintained on schedule by providing a priority for the purchase of materials by contractors, subcontractors, and their suppliers; secondly, that the operation of the system results in the mainten- ance of an administrative means of promptly mobiliz- ing the total economic resources of the country in case of a declared national emergency. 660287. Maximizing Aircraft Production for Industrial Readiness Programs. P. T. Rafter and L. A. McKinnis, McDonnell Aircraft Corp. The Industrial Readiness Planning Program for na- tional defense is designed to prepare a producer for accelerated delivery of critical weapon systems dur- ing a national emergency. The dynamic character of the aerospace industry combined with the pre- mises of national emergency demands effective and responsive planning of resources in order to maxim- ize aircraft production for industrial readiness pro- grams. These programs are developed prior to na- tional emergency, and therefore preconceived con- ditions of pertinent internal resources must be real- istically projected. Since readiness programs are primarily concerned with productive capacity, re- lated factors must be used in planning internal re- sources, but specifics vary between companies and these variations affect overall planning. Discussed 97</page><page sequence="39">660289-660295 are typical approaches for accelerating or compress- ing schedule requirements. Some current problems are identified and recommended solutions are pro- posed. 660289. Profile Milling of Titanium. A. L. Pick- rell, Boeing Co. Profile milling of titanium combines the problems of a relatively new manufacturing process with those of machining a new material. Titanium is not diffi- cult to machine as compared to steel of equivalent strength; however, it must be properly processed or higher cutter costs and low production output will result. The process of profile milling can be greatly improved through the use of adaptive control. Two elements of the numerical control machining pro- cess, the part programmer and the machine operator, are sources of considerable process variability. Con- sequently, in the foreseeable future adaptive con- trol concepts will be applied to the process to im- prove efficiency by reducing this "people" influence on machine output. 1967 SAE Transactions 660290. Hot Drape Forming of Torus and Semi- Toroidal Bulkhead Segments. F. J. Hoppe and W. B. Trepei, Fairchild-Hiller Corp. The "hot drape forming process" provides an inte- grated method for forming-stretching and heat treat- ing of 7039 and X7106 aluminum alloys to a toroidal segment configuration. An electrically heated cera- mic die was used for the process. Its construction permitted selective zone heating for controlled stretching of an area. The forming and stretching was accomplished by means of two "contour wiper plates" which provided good forming at the edge areas. In addition, the part was heat treated (solution treated, spray-water quenched, and aged) while clamped down on the die. The process produced a stress-free, accurately formed, heat treated part with uniform thickness. It is believed that this process can be used for other configurations more reliably and efficiently than other conventional methods. 1967 SAE Transactions 660291. Ductility of Beryllium Cross-Rolled Sheet- Barrier or Challenge. S. E. Ing- els, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Production techniques required for the severe form- ing of commercially available cross-rolled beryllium sheet are described. Configurations prepared with these techniques include straight bends, curved channels, hemispherical segments, and semicylind- ers with spherical ends. A minimum acceptable bend radius 5t, an optimum forming temperature of 1350 F, and shrink and stretch values of 9.0 and 13.0%, re- spectively, are established by statistical, metallo- graphic, and dimensional analysis. The feasibility of the extreme forming of cross-rolled sheet material, as required for many aerospace applications, is clear- ly demonstrated. 1967 SAE Transactions 660292. New Developments in Aluminum Weld- ing. P. G. Parks, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. A critical review of aluminum welding was made to determine the kinds of internal defects which lower the strength and reliability of welds. The principal kinds of defects were found to be porosity and metal- lurgical changes in the heat affected zone. Basic in- vestigations have isolated single parameters and combinations of parameters which have statistical significance as causes of porosity. Improper time- temperature cycles are the cause of detrimental met- allurgical changes. Knowledge of the parameters, combinations of parameters, and time-temperature cycles can be used to produce significant improve- ment in the reliability of aluminum weldments. 660293. FAA Concept in Safety for the SST. R. S. Sliff, Federal Aviation Agency. This paper presents the airworthiness and opera- tional standards approaches toward assuring a high level of safety for the supersonic transport. A des- cription is given of the major technical problems and the means established for their resolution. 660294. SST Operations and Maintenance Con- siderations. J. R. Gannett and R. T. Dix- on, Boeing Co. The SST pilot will have at his command more auto- matic equipment and better readout and displays to control noise level near the airport, to program the climb for minimum sonic boom, and to operate the airplane to lower weather minimums than on any previous transport. Yet, Boeing believes the typical senior airline captain will make the transition with- out any difficulty. The SST mechanic will have new and larger facilities, will handle bigger and heavier equipment, will learn to maintain airplanes still hot with residual heat, and will learn to maintain and repair that new metal titanium. The mechanic will find SST maintenance and repair the best planned and organized of any airplane program yet. 660295. Operating Techniques and Mainten- ance Practices for the Lockheed SST. W. W. Magruder and J. F. McDonald, Lockheed-California Co. The operational and maintenance characteristics of 98</page><page sequence="40">a commercial double delta supersonic transport are compared with those of contemporary subsonic ve- hicles. It is shown that the large delta wing in com- bination with the high thrust engines provides ex- ceptional safety margins for take-off and landing conditions. The pilot's viewpoint is given upon low speed handling and controllability in emergency situations. Community noise is discussed together with sonic boom considerations and upper air mete- orological effects are briefly reviewed. Operational flight planning is examined including climb and transonic acceleration, supersonic cruise and des- cent to subsonic speeds. Existing runway lengths and strengths are shown to be generally satisfactory. Turn-around and en route stop conditions are briefly analyzed together with line maintenance aspects. Arrangement of the aircraft for maintenance pur- poses is described and reference is also made to in- flight data processing, engine change techniques, overhaul schedules and ground support equipment. Comments on maintenance considerations peculiar to such an aircraft are made and the general design philosophy is reviewed at this stage of the U.S. Su- personic Transport Program. 1967 SAE Transactions 660296. Propulsion Systems - Airline Opera- tional and Economic Coals. N. R. Par- met and W. D. Sherwood, Trans World Airlines, Inc. Successful use of the public benefits of air transpor- tation at supersonic speeds will require attainment of many goals. Five requisites are categorized and examined in relation to the propulsion system. Spe- cifically, the needs of reliability, maintainability, operational flexibility, salability, and profitability are discussed and the interplay and accumulative effects are described. Goals for the SST propulsion system are compared to the status of today's opera- tion and data showing historical trends are presented. Achievement of these goals is shown to require a team effort with complete freedom of two way com- munication between manufacturer and user during the entire design phase and aircraft life. 660297. Supersonic Transports - Propulsion Systems- Application of Advanced Technology. W. L. Gorton, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The SST will require considerable advanced tech- nology in several areas of the engine propulsion sys- tem. The steps taken by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft to advance the state-of-the-art related to the fulfillment of these requirements are described. Above all, it is emphasized that a satisfactory commercial SST en- 660296-660300 gine for all practical purposes must include a de- velopment program after engine certification and qualification that is comparable in magnitude to that achieved prior to certification. This continuing de- velopment program is essential in order to attain the maximum in engine dependability, durability, and maintenance. 660298. Supersonic Transport Propulsion Sys- tems-Operational Growth Feasibility. G. Neuman, Flight Propulsion Div., Gen- eral Elee. Co. Since the first passenger-carrying aircraft went into service, each major new aircraft type has grown in size, weight, performance, reliability, and econo- mics. Thus, history, plus a sharply increasing travel market, have provided statistics that define general requirements for development and growth needs of the powerplants for supersonic transports. General Electric's GE4 turbojet engine for the United States SST is examined, from a conceptual design and de- velopment program standpoint, against today's air- lines requirements. The important criteria of a relia- ble and mature engine for initial SST service is re- lated to the prospect of that engine's operational growth capability for the future, with emphasis on maintainability, safety, performance, and economics. 660299. Role of the University in Developing Professional Manufacturing Engineers. D. F. Baker, Ohio State Univ. This paper outlines briefly the history of manufac- turing engineering and discusses the problems asso- ciated with meeting the technical manpower require- ments associated with large scale engineering devel- opment. The major thesis presented is that the escala- tion of technology associated with major engineering projects undertaken in manufacturing has brought about the need for engineering talent from many disciplines and that a major effort in the management of the large number of professional technical person- nel in large manufacturing enterprise is required. It is suggested that recruiting and preparing of profes- sional engineering manpower required in manufac- turing should be a joint effort between the manufac- turing industry and the university at all organiza- tional levels and at all stages of professional career development. 1967 SAE Transactions 660300. Manufacturing Engineering in Indus- try. D. A. Spetta, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Professionalism in the manufacturing engineering field is reflected through a demonstrated attitude of the individual caring about his own personal prog- 99</page><page sequence="41">660301-660307 ress and his progress on the job, together with man- agement recognization of all the different disciplines that make up the manufacturing engineering team. This philosophy is indicated in the obligation of man- agement to provide opportunity for advancement to all working within the manufacturing engineering specialties, regardless of the individual's educational level at the outset. A planned approach providing steps to offer continual professional growth in manu- facturing engineering at Grumman is described. Rec- ommendations are also made as to specific objectives which would help clarify the importance of the manu- facturing engineer's role in industry. 660301. Manufacturing Engineer in the Space Program. M. P. L. Siebel, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The unique problems encountered in the manufac- ture of space vehicles are reviewed. The role of the manufacturing engineer in the production of space vehicles is described by using examples from the S-IC stage and by discussing the missions of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at the Mar- shall Space Flight Center. A conclusion is drawn that the manufacturing engineer is truly a professional by virtue of his training in engineering fundamen- tals, his experience, and his devotion to the public interest. Finally the training, recruitment, and growth of the professional manufacturing engineer are reviewed. Some missionary zeal by the profes- sion is advocated. 660302. Attracting and Developing Professional Manufacturing Engineers - An Air Force Viewpoint. Col. F. F. Swan, Air Force Contract Management Div. (AFSC). Although the military services are enjoined by law and directives from competing with industry in man- ufacturing they, nonetheless, have a distinct need for attracting and developing professional manufactur- ing engineers. During the past five years those agen- cies responsible for procurement of major weapon systems have been faced with the increasing criti- cally to national survival of meeting predicted per- formance, cost, and schedule goals, and also changes toward fixed price and incentive contracts. A review is made of how the Air Force Contract Management Division (AFSC) is solving the problem; job oppor- tunities in industrial engineering for professional growth and career progression are cited, and exam- ples of accomplishment are given. 660303. Unit-System Picture Has Many Angles. C. F. Kayan, Columbia Univ. For 75 years there has been fruitless sporadic ac- tivity in efforts to resolve our unit-system chaos and confusion. There now appears some progress, how- ever, toward effecting a solution in this difficult and controversial area. One reason for past lack of action may be due to the single-purpose solution of enthus- iasts advocating complete changeover to the metric system for the United States, notwithstanding the many problems involved and the possibilities of gradual evolution toward adoption of a new system. The arguments on both sides of the question are dealt with, and a number of steps proposed for realis- tically attacking the problem. 1967 SAE Transactions 660304. Is United States Evolution to the Metric System Desirable? G. M. Muschamp, Honeywell, Inc. There is a trend toward the adoption of the metric system in the United States which can be acceler- ated or retarded as advantages and disadvantages are identified, publicized, and acted upon. Studious evaluation of the pros and cons is needed, particu- larly net cost of conversion, compensated for the cost recoveries and annualized so as to take the time ele- ment into account. Improved communication be- tween engineers and scientists in the United States and between United States technical people and those of other countries would be enhanced by adop- tion of the metric system in the United States. Strong feelings on both sides points to the desirability of supporting fact finding such as the proposed study pending in Congress. 660305. Some Problems the Fastener Industry Perceives in Effecting Aerospace Con- version to the Metric System. F. W. Ak- stens, Industrial Fasteners Institute. This paper discusses the effect conversion to the metric system of weights, measures, and standards would have on the technological and industrial base of the U.S., with particular emphasis on the impact such a conversion would have on our aerospace in- dustry. Using the experience of British industry and its reaction to British government's recent announce- ment to convert to metric, the difficulties facing any industrial nation are described. 660307. Shaping Economic Justification Pro- cedures. R. W. Johnson, ARO Corp. The ARO Corp. has evolved an approach to the econ- omic justification of expenditures which takes ad- vantage of a small company's close-knit organization, and at the same time utilizes very progressive and technically advanced principles. This paper des- cribes the organization and the practices at ARO, and gives examples ranging from small to large projects. 100</page><page sequence="42">660308. Planning for Economie Justification of Equipment. M.J. Dellape, Martin Co. One of the most difficult management decisions in- volves the allocation of funds for capital expendi- tures. The purpose of this paper is to offer some rec- ommendations and procedures which will enhance the planning and control of capital expenditures for equipment. Top management will still make the final decision, and no procedure will ever replace it. The procedures here suggested are not substitutes for good judgment but, rather, provide a means by which to apply judgment and with closer approximation to the realities of the situation. 660309. Selling Your Capital Programs. E. Au- zenbergs, TRW, Inc. Unless in today's multimillion dollar corporations capital expenditure proposals are well organized, clearly presented, and easily understood, much un- necessary delay in the project's approval can be en- countered. This paper analyzes the important ele- ments that should be considered and presented in selling the various components of a corporate capital expenditure program, emphasizing the necessity of presenting profitability figures, and briefly touches upon the merits of having and using capital program- ming in large organizations. 1967 SAE Transactions 660310. Protective Coatings for Extended Life at Aircraft Jet Engine Parts. W. E. Helf- rich, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whit- ney Aircraft. One of the problems associated with long part life in aircraft jet engines is wear in nonlubricated mat- ing parts resulting from vibration, fretting, impact, or sliding during engine operation. A significant im- provement in the life of engine parts subject to this type of wear can be achieved by coating mating sur- faces with protective, wear resistant materials. Nu- merous plasma sprayed and detonation flame plated coatings have been developed for this purpose. Suc- cessful use of the plasma sprayed coatings in these applications is dependent on development of the necessary coating properties and strict control of the coating process. Engine experience with both types of protective coatings has been most successful when tailored to the environment and type of wear en- countered. 1967 SAE Transactions 66031 1 ‚Ä¢ Designing to Avoid Fatigue in Long Life Engines. C. E. Danforth, Flight Propul- sion Div., General Elee. Co. Control of vibration, emphasis on the cyclic charac- ter of engine operation accentuated by long life, the control of transient thermal response, and a constant 660308-660314 sensitivity to the limitations of familiar measures of material strength in establishing permissable levels of structural loads are key factors in assuring from the outset engines insensitive to fatigue for long life. Blade, accessory part, and overall system design are given as illustrations of vibration control. Thermal fatigue presentation is illustrated in terms of cooled turbine blading. The need to be mindful of the mean- ing of material strength factors in assuring high time, high cycle life engines is suggested in the treatment of cycling-rupture-vibration interactions . Increas- ingly precise analysis and experimental verification as an integral part of the design process make possi- ble the increasingly complex design execution and attainment of design goals. 1967 SAE Transactions 660312. Getting the Most Out of Gas Turbine Parts. J. J. Eden, Air Canada. Although the design lives of subsonic gas turbine engine components and parts are attainable within the current state-of-the-art, in practice they may not be reached. The factors which could be responsible for reduced life of a part include metallurgical and dimensional variances; incorrect production, over- hauling, maintenance, or handling techniques; im- proper assessment of usage (stress-cycle relation- ships); faulty environment; and/or unrealistic build policy. Practical suggestions for obtaining greater life from currently produced gas turbine parts are given. 660313. Extended Engine Life through In-Serv- ice Development. J. F. Leamon and J. T. Pratt, Trans World Airlines, Inc. The economic impact of commercial airline engine material costs generates a demand for an aggressive and timely approach toward extending component life. Factors affecting component life and the meth- ods used to combat them are discussed. The keynote, however, is that more component repair must be done - and it must be done faster. The airlines, the engine manufacturers, and the manufacturers of ad- vance process equipment are all challenged to be- come more progressive in longer component life development. 660314. Development of High-Performance Ro- tary-Wing VTOL Aircraft. L. H. Ludi, Army Aviation Materiel Labs. This paper summarizes the programs for, and some of the results of, the Army's continuing effort in the development of high performance rotary wing VTOL aircraft. The objective of this continuing effort is to: (1) Increase the state of the art of rotary wing air- craft by providing advanced measured design data; 101</page><page sequence="43">660315-660319 (2) Validate by flight tests the design concepts that indicate marked improvements; and (3) Provide rec- ommendations for increasing the capability of all future Army rotary wing aircraft. 1967 SAE Transactions 66031 5. Report on Stability and Control Testing of a Tilt Wing V/STOL Aircraft. W. S. Longhurst, Canadair Ltd. A limited test program is being conducted on a pro- totype of the Canadair CL-84 tilt-wing V/STOL air- craft to evaluate its stability and control design ob- jectives. The results to date indicate that only very minor modifications were necessary with regard to the flying control criteria previously established through analysis, fixed-base simulator studies, and variable-stability helicopter tests. In general, the qualitative assessment made this far of the handling qualities of the CL-84 has proven the adequacy of the established criteria for stability and control performance for systems as complex as the CL-84. 660316. Effect of Size on the Economics of a V/STOL Transport Airplane. G. D. Ray, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. To have good economy, aircraft should be large enough that the variation of payload as a percentage of gross weight is not affected greatly by a small change in gross weight. Particular attention for weight saving should be directed towards fixed items of an airplane's weight that are dictated by the mis- sion. To be economical, a VTOL airplane can be ex- pected to have a higher gross weight than a STOL or CTOL. VTOL transports permit major reductions in total time for accomplishing a mission. The VTOL system will be cheaper than STOL or CTOL for short mission accomplishment times. It is necessary to evaluate total savings resulting for shorter mission accomplishment times, but this is difficult because the ability to do things faster permits doing more things in a different manner. 660317. Commercial V/STOL and the Califor- nia Corridor. R. B. Meyersburg, Federal Aviation Agency. Realistic assessment of the role of V/STOL air trans- portation in the 1970's is important to government transportation policies being formulated. Studies of a system, including the vehicle, airport, air traffic, and navigation facilities, were conducted in a speci- fic market- the California Corridor. Four VTOL aircraft representing various concepts were designed to a common set of requirements. These aircraft, one STOL, a conventional jet aircraft, and a conven- tional helicopter, were operated in a simulated air- line network. Costs and revenues were compared to those of conventional jet aircraft operating on the same airline network. Ground transportation systems were assessed, including the automobile which is a formidable opponent on shorter routes. The STOL/ VTOL systems by virtue of their convenience and overall speed, capture some traffic from other trans- portation means and generate new customer markets. 660318. V/STOL Transport Aircraft for Inter- city Passenger Movement. N. W. Tilling- hast and G. B. Pearson, LTV Aerospace Corp. This paper presents a discussion of some of the key considerations associated with the use of V/STOL transport aircraft for intercity passenger movement. Travel demand is related to V/STOL aircraft opera- tions insofar as it influences the optimum terminal site location. Cost-benefit comparisons are presented from the viewpoints of: aircraft operations, airport construction, and passenger fares. The impact of V/STOL technology on existing equipment and fa- cilities, traffic servicing standards, and flight opera- tions is assessed. The study reports that V/STOL air- craft will be a desirable transit mode for the regional intercity passenger market expected to become dom- inant during the next decades. 660319. Commercial Helicopter Outlook Verti- cal Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Air- craft Air Traffic Control System. G. Litchford, Aviation Systems Consultant; and J. E. Gallagher, New York Airways, Inc. The inauguration of true city center schedules coupled with the tremendous response from the trav- eling public and the continuing increase in passen- ger seat mile revenues for over a decade of VTOL scheduled air carrier service is evidence of the pub- lic need and confirmation of a continuing expansion of operations. Future research and development will be directed at reducing operating costs and improv- ing schedule regularity on trip lengths that vary from the very short inter-airport to city distances to up- wards of a hundred miles. The airframe manufac- turers are already building helicopters large enough to carry 45 to 65 passengers and if adequate progress can be made in reducing direct operating costs (and thereby lowering seat mile costs), helicopters will become a common mode of air transportation in the very short-haul market. One significant advantage of VTOL air transportation is the flexibility of serv- ice patterns that can be provided. As neighborhoods change in character and new residential and cor- porate headquarter communities are developed in previously uninhabited areas, VTOL air services 102</page><page sequence="44">can adjust accordingly. All that is needed is a rela- tively small landing and terminal area. By compari- son, surface transportation whether by transit sys- tems or private vehicles, assumes a rather inflexible pattern once it is established. They often require a good deal of extremely expensive real estate and force the relocation of many people at high economic and sociological costs. The need to provide service regularity through improved specially suited navi- gation, air traffic control and approach facilities for flight operation in instrument meteorological condi- tions is essential. Hard and controlled operating experience with a low frequency navigational aid and tests of various VTOL landing systems and techniques are reviewed. The use of the Air Traffic Control Beacon (secondary radar), communications and the relationship of VTOL requirements is compared to fixed wing re- quirements. Air space requirements of fixed wing and VTOL aircraft do not normally compete except in the proximity of the airport. It would appear that practical and operationally compatible procedures can be developed for mixing these different types of air traffic. In order to assure still greater public ac- ceptance of VTOL air carrier services the regularity of schedules, with instrument flight capability, must be considerably improved over the present visual flight operations. Some suggestions for the direction of future effort in the development of navigation and air traffic control hardware and procedures for in- strument operation are presented. 660320. Operational V/STOL? Kestrel Tripar- tite Evaluation. P. R. Curry and J. A. Johnston, Army XV-6A Tri-Service Evalu- ation Team. This paper describes certain aspects of the Kestrel (P-1127) Tripartite V/STOL Operational Trials which commenced Jan. 1, 1962. The aspects des- cribed include the purpose of the trials, a brief chron- ology, a description of the test aircraft, the organiza- tion of the test unit, the scope of the trials, and sel- ected results and conclusions of the trials. 1967 SAE Transactions 660321. Re-Engining Large Jet Transports in 1972? - Economics and Technology. F. Searls and C. Y. Joe, United Air Lines, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to explore one part of the 1972 commercial air transport picture. New jet engine and aircraft technology will be available which offers substantial advantages in operating economics. A major portion of the improvement will come by way of the engine redesigns. Higher by- pass ratios, higher turbine inlet temperatures, and 660320-660324 substantially advanced structural concepts point in the direction of lower direct operating costs. An an- alysis is made using these "new technology" engines on older fleets of large jet transports. Results show that the domestic operators have little to gain. Long- er range, intercontinental operators may find the en- gine conversion attractive for some route segments where range is critical. Engine maintenance costs, among other costs, associated with reengining are considered. Finally, using these results, an estimate is made of an airplane size which will maximize the cost-reduction potential of the engines. 1967 SAE Transactions 660322. Candidate Turbofan Engines for Sub- sonic Aircraft of the 1970s. G. H. Ped- ersen and J. C. Smith, Wright Aero. Div., Curtiss-Wright Corp. Research and development efforts for improving subsonic propulsion systems for long range trans- ports must be directed at providing advanced tech- nology in the fields of high cycle pressure ratio com- pressor, regenerators, high temperature turbines, and engine/air-frame minimum drag installations. Efforts in these areas can be expected to decrease current direct operating cost levels a minimum of 20 percent, and perhaps decrease them as much as 30 percent. 660323. New Engine Technology and the Sub- sonic Transport. J. Morris, Aircraft Div., Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. During the course of the C-5A Heavy Logistics Transport Studies, a new level of engine technology emerged. The object of this paper is to demonstrate what impact engines designed to that technology level would have on the commercial subsonic trans- port. Three cases have been considered: (1) installing new engines on an existing airframe, (2) increasing fuselage size and passenger capacity of an existing aircraft as well as fitting new engines, and (3) using a completely new aircraft with new engines. 660324. Manufacturing Engineering: A Partner in Advance Product Design. L. R. Glass- burner, Beech Aircraft Corp. The multiplicity of advancements in the aerospace sciences and manufacturing technologies have brought both promises and problems. Successful integration of this knowledge is clearly reflected in the product profit. The successful development and introduction of new products is not a matter of "luck" but rather enlightened, comprehensive, step-by-step planning accomplished in cooperation with the pro- duct designer early in the product phase. The pro- 103</page><page sequence="45">660325-660336 mise of continued acceleration of new scientific knowledge and development of new technologies will require manufacturing engineers with vision, courage, the ability to plan, and the desire to learn. 660325. Manufacturing Engineering Contribu- tion to Design-Development. W. S. No- chisaki and I. E. Krizan, United Aircraft Corp., Sikorsky Aircraft Div. New product design, and the development effort ac- companying it, requires a high degree of coordina- tion between manufacturing and design engineering. Manufacturing engineering, with the responsibility for determining how a product will be fabricated, is in a position to exert positive influence on product design as well as the areas of capital investment, labor distribution, and profitability. The activities of the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering group at Sikorsky Aircraft are herein described. Both design and manufacturing problems are reviewed with emphasis on specific contributions made by manu- facturing engineering to their solution. Advanced manufacturing techniques are described and the final designs using these techniques are discussed. 660326. Modern Manufacturing Methods for Shaped Honeycomb Core. J.J. Kenna, Jr. and H. R. Cook, General Dynamics Corp. Methods and equipment have been developed to sculpture aluminum honeycomb core. Three special honeycomb mills, hand-step cutting equipment, and a composite tooling material are being utilized to contour machine aluminum honeycomb on a produc- tion basis. 660327. Design, Fabrication and Cost Relation- ships for Titanium Sheet Structures. J. S. Newman and A. E. Nelsen, Grumman Air- craft Engrg. Corp. A description of the design and fabrication cost re- lationships of formed titanium sheet structures is given. Emphasis is placed on the potential advan- tages of implementing an advanced hot forming con- cept and related equipment. The use of this concept and/or equipment will insure quality products at minimum cost by extending current design and fab- rication limitations and reducing the number of tools, parts, assembly operations, and assembly fit- up time normally required for structural assembly. 660332. Air Transportation Plan in the Eastern Corridor. R. H. Miller, Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology. f The potentials of short haul air transportation sys- tems are projected to the mid-1970 and 1980 periods. The costs and operational characteristics of these systems are sensitive to the size and nature of the travel market which, at the present time, is not well defined. However, indications are that air transporta- tion could hold the key to the solution of the prob- lems of short haul travel in heavily populated areas. 660333. United Aircraft Turbine Powered Train and Its Suspension System. R. H. Shatz, United Aircraft Corporate Systems Center. The turbine motor train designed by United Aircraft Corp. represents a systems approach to high-speed rail service, and incorporates many unique features that will permit operation at speeds up to 160 mph on existing roadbeds with significant savings in trip time and maintenance costs. Special emphasis is given the suspension system used on the UAC tur- bine powered train. The advantages of this system are that it banks the car body proportional to the lateral force, allowing higher speeds on curves with comfort equal to or greater than is now encountered. Also, intermediate axles are guided to eliminate the oscillations or truck hunting encountered in conven- tional trucks. 660335. Vertical Flight in Common Carrier Transportation. R. L. Cummings, New York Airways, Inc. Helicopters capable of vertical flight have opened a new market for air transportation. They offer a means of rapid access to city centers avoiding the congestion and wasted time of surface travel. The growing success of the high frequency common car- rier operations of New York Airways, conducted be- tween La Guardia field, the Wall Street Heliport, Newark Airport and Kennedy International Airport, and between Kennedy International Airport and the Pan Am Building Heliport in mid-Manhattan, have set an example of service for densely populated areas everywhere. 660336. Place of the Helicopter in a Megalopoli- tan Transport System. C. C. Wood, United Aircraft Corp., Sikorsky Aircraft Div. The helicopter has a role to play in transportation and this is shown in comparison to the automobile, train, and airplane. Economic costs, based on fares and value of time while traveling, have been used to determine the effectiveness of each system. Si- multaneous comparison of all four systems presents definite economic boundaries between them. Each system serves a specific segment of the transporta- tion market. In this regard, the helicopter is current- ly superior in serving the quantity transportation market for ranges of 20-200 miles, and for ranges of 30-300 miles in the future. 1967 SAE Transactions 104</page><page sequence="46">660337. Assisted Landing and Takeoff for Short Field Commercial Aircraft. C.J. Daniels, All Amer. Engrg. Co. During recent years the technology of launching and arresting aircraft aboard aircraft carriers has been applied to land based runway operations. Such appli- cation results in remarkably short runways, excellent safety considerations, and accelerations that are es- sentially similar to peak conditions of current com- mercial aircraft operations. Present military equip- ment for assisted take-off and landing is briefly ex- plained and illustrated, and applications to large commercial jet transports, as well as to small commer- cial aircraft, are examined. 660338. International Automotive Trends. W. C. McDonald, Jr., Ford Motor Co. The overseas automotive industry is discussed with a review of the market, political, and financial con- ditions. Less stringent tariff barriers and an increase in the individual's purchasing power will strongly in- fluence future design trends; and modification of present license and insurance limitations will per- mit more reasonable engine designs with increased power and size. As the competitive pace increases, there will be a trend to shorter product cycles, and a larger number of models will be available with more convenience and luxury options. The rapid growth of the car market in the free world is bringing about an expansion of road systems to permit better utiliza- tion of the automobiles. 660339. New Approach to Diesel Smoke Sup- pression. George R. Norman, Lubrizol Corp. Through proper treatment of diesel fuel, using a bar- ium containing additive, exhaust smoke can be effec- tively suppressed in a wide variety of diesel engines. This additive has been found to produce no adverse effects on engine components and often results in additional benefits, including greater engine clean- liness and piston ring wear reduction. 660340.

Automotive Gas Turbine - Its Fuel and Lubricant Requirements. W. A. Herbst, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. This paper reviews available information on the fuel and lubricant requirements of vehicular size gas turbine engines to highlight important quality as- pects and indicate potential trouble spots. The indi- cations are that the hydrogen content, boiling range, and viscosity of the fuel are important parameters related to carbon deposition, flame luminosity, and spray characteristics. These turbine engines per- form well on available petroleum base lubricating oils of good oxidation resistance and antiwear char- acteristics. Special fuels and lubricants can be pro- vided for the automotive turbine, if necessary. How- ever, their distribution and handling costs will be high. There will thus be a strong price incentive to use currently available products wherever possible. 660342. Chrysler Corporation's New Hemi Head High Performance Engines. W. L. Weert- man and R. J.

(SP-280) High Output Diesel Engines - Diesel Combustion at High MEP with Low Compression Ratio. W. P. Mansfield and W. S. May, British Internal Combus- tion Eng. Res. Inst. Ltd. Very high mean effective pressures can be obtained from the diesel engine with limited maximum cylin- der pressures by using a large clearance volume, that is, a low compression ratio, at high loads. The result- ant low compression temperature is an added advan- tage as far as power production is concerned, but gives rise to excessive ignition delay and hence un- controlled combustion.

Feasibility Study of New York State Safety Car Program- A Preliminary Report. John O. Moore, and Henry H. Wakeland, New York Motor Vehicle Dept.; James A. Clark, Republic Aviation Corp. This paper describes the legislative background, ob- jectives and results to date of the New York State study of the feasibility of designing a prototype safe- ty car suitable for limited mass production. The pre- liminary results of the study, which is using the sys- tems analysis approach, indicate that it is feasible to design a vehicle which can sustain barrier impacts at 50 mph, 40 mph side impacts, rear impacts at 50 mph and rolling impacts at 70 mph with the reduction of at least 50 per cent of the grades of injury for moderate through fatal seen in present-day automobiles. One conceptual design has been produced to date. The study is devoting attention to operating systems to reduce accident causes, structural systems to reduce injury causes and non-operating systems to reduce risk of accidents and injuries when the car is not being driven. 660346. Experimental Determination of the De- pendence of the Minimum Spark Igni- tion Energy Upon the Rate of Energy Release. J. C. Steiner, General Motors Corp.; and W. Mirsky, Michigan Univ. The conventional ignition system utilizing an induc- tion coil produces a spark consisting of a capacitive or high energy rate component and an inductive or low energy rate component. Predominant among conflicting arguments reported in the literature is - the argument that the high energy rate component is the more effective for ignition of combustible mix- tures. An investigation was conducted to measure the effect of the rate of energy release upon mini- mum spark ignition energy with electrode spacings greater than the quench distances reported in the literature. Lean, quiescent, propane-air mixtures were studied in a constant volume bomb. Results in- dicate that the minimum ignition energy decreased as the instantaneous peak power or peak rate of ener- gy release was increased. Discussion: R. C.

Martinengo, Inst, of Physical Chemistry, Gottingen University. Under the condition of adiabatic compression the ignition of different fuel-air mixtures has been inves- tigated for a large range of initial conditions. The ig- nition behavior of these mixtures could be charac- terized by delay times and reaction rates as functions of temperature, pressure, and composition. A better understanding of the whole ignition process, for one stage as well as for two stage ignition, could be ob- tained by measuring the concentration of reactants, intermediates, and products during the course of the preignition reactions (delay times of milleseconds).

Neuser, Eng. and Fdy. Div., Ford Motor Co. Until recently, the sheer enormity of manual compu- tation has limited valve train design analysis to static models involving a few parameters. However, with today's high-speed electronic digital computers, the analyst can now perform a more comprehensive in- vestigation. A collection of mathematical expressions which have been formulated, tested and revised, describe some condition, characteristic or actual part of a valve train. These expressions have been en- coded to form a system of computer programs which model the valve train under study. This modeling simulates the test of maximum design limits in a safe and economical manner. The success of such model- ing in valve train development depends in part on the validity of the model concept and its symbolic representation. The development of a valid model is enhanced by the speed embodied in computer-aided procedures to conduct tests, analyze test data and present summary information. The subject matter of this paper encompasses the nature and use of this model, explains how the model provides a better understanding of casual relations in the valve train, and presents a representative computer output used for analysis and summary purposes. 660349.

Crandall, Oldsmobile Div., GMC. Oldsmobile's Engine Design Group has replaced a lengthy semigraphical crankshaft design balance procedure with a computerized design analysis pro- 660350-660355 gram for V-8 crankshafts. This paper explains how the computer is used to reduce the time required, human errors, and complexity in crankshaft balance and weight optimization.

The des- cribed system permits rapid and accurate surface de- velopment and has been proved to be thoroughly predictable. The ability to compute the coordinates and surface normals of a large number of arbitrarily selected points on a nonlinear surface is mandatory with numerical control applications. The described system affords this capability for the five axis part programming of compound surfaces. 1967 SAE Transactions 660354. APT- Present and Future. P. Aranda, S. Hori, and R. N.

The one-piece cover linkless type of battery con- struction represents a major automotive battery inno- vation. The smooth unobstructed top of the linkless one-piece cover allows for maximum design flexi- bility and improved design potentials. The internal construction makes possible improved battery per- formance. The need to redesign containers and cov- ers completely when changing to the new design has provided battery manufacturers the opportunity to incorporate many features into this improved battery construction. 660357. Battery Operations. T. J. Varga, General Parts Div., Ford Motor Co. A significant increase in battery service life has taken place in recent years due to major improvements in the vehicle electrical power supply system. Factors contributing to the better battery service life are out- lined in this paper. These include battery design im- provements, alternator systems, lower voltage regu- lator settings, battery installation improvements, and charging system wiring changes. Battery service life with present alternator systems is compared to service life obtained with earlier battery designs on generator equipped cars. 660358. Dry Charge Processing- Its Effect on Battery Performance. J. P. Badger, Pres- tolite Co. The cranking ability of dry-charged batteries immed- iately after cold activation decreases as both the lead oxide content of the negative plates and the resis- tance of the positive plates increases. The presence of a wetting agent in the negative plate material ac- celerates the formation of lead oxide during storage. The resistance of the positive plates is sensitive to drying conditions. Low resistance results if the water vapor content of the drying atmosphere is kept low. 660359. Some News of European Starter Bat- teries. E. O. A. Blaich, Robert Bosch G.m.b.H.

Development of the Glass Ceramic Re- generator for the Rover 2S/150R En- gine. R. N. Penny, Rover Co. Ltd. A glass ceramic regenerative heat exchanger has been successfully applied to a small basic gas tur- bine of simple layout. This development has given encouragement for further application of high tem- perature ceramics to small gas turbine designs. As a result brief information is given on one form of ad- vanced design of small gas turbine incorporating the wider use of high temperature ceramics. The basic Rover engine involved in the development of the ceramic regenerator was originally conceived with steel recuperative heat exchangers and has been in operation with these for many years. Therefore the opportunity is taken to compare the relative merits of these two main types of heat exchanger. The signifi- cant aspects of the development in applying the glass ceramic regenerator to the Rover 2S/150R engine are openly outlined. Discussion: P. A. Pitt, International Harvester Co.; D. J. S.

LP-Gas Tractors Deserve Careful Spark Plug Selection. G. M. Galster and J. S. Pigott, Champion Spark Plug Co. Spark plug heat range requirements, preignition li- mits, and ignition voltage requirements were inves- tigated in several liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fueled engines. These tests show that ignition volt- age requirements both for cold starting and for run- 108</page><page sequence="50">ning are considerably higher than with gasoline. It is also shown that very cold running spark plugs are both undesirable and unnecessary with LPG fuels. Spark plug design can be utilized to reduce voltage requirements and to improve the overall perform- ance of these engines. Projected core nose type spark plugs may offer additional performance benefits in LPG tractor engines. 660364. Future Fuel and Lubricant Require- ments for Agricultural Tractors. J. W. Walker and M.

Present areas of concern which tend to define future requirements are outlined. In addi- tion, specific areas where lubricants for agricultural tractor engines need further understanding of the lubrication phenomena involved are pointed out and a possible revision in current engine oil test procedure is suggested. With the rapid development in engine and other tractor components, optimiza- tion of tractor design dictates that fuels and lubri- cants need to be considered an integral part of the overall vehicle design. 660365.

This paper discusses a new high efficiency variable speed permanent magnet (PM) d-c electric motor de- signed for initial use in windshield wiper assemblies on 1967 passenger cars. It traces the development from the basic two-speed, three-brush PM motor to the more sophisticated variable speed unit. Labora- tory test data are used to compare performance of a variable speed wire-wound design and a two-speed PM motor with the new variable speed PM unit. Evolution of the needed circuitry is discussed and illustrated. The importance of using a diode in the circuit is stressed as the key to success in the high efficiency variable speed PM development. 660366. Moisture Protection of Window Lift Motors. R. D. Montgomery, Chrysler Corp. This is an evaluation and description of the methods and materials used to moisture proof window lift motors as applied inside automotive doors. An en- vironmental test cabinet is described. The materials and methods were tested for their ability to seal, their resistance to abuse, their application to the motor housing, their resistance to lubrication, and their cost. The methods of moisture protection inves- tigated were: drain holes, moisture proofing mate- rials, and positioning. Considering all aspects, gas- 660364-660370 ket seals between the motor frame and the housing proved to be a superior way to protect motors from water damage. 660367.

Torque Converter as a Vibrator Damp- er and Its Transient Characteristics. T. Ishihara and R. I. Emori, Inst, of Industrial Science, Tokyo Univ. Equations of nonsteady-state motion of a torque con- verter were established and its speed changing per- formance was obtained. Damping effects of a torque converter on torsional vibrations were clarified by linearizing the equations around a steady-state oper- ating point. Theoretical results showed good agree- ments with experiments. It was found that steady- state characteristics may be used in the analysis of a non-steady-state phenomenon. Torque converters were successfully stimulated by a vibration model, which simplified the vibration analysis of a system. 1967 SAE Transactions 660370. CITE Fuels - Some Pump, Some Don't. J. T. Gray, Jr., E. Dimitroff, and N. T. Meckel, Army Fuels and Lubricants Res. Lab., Southwest Res. Inst. An engineering study was conducted to gain a bet- ter understanding of the system and fuel factors af- fecting low temperature pumping performance of CITE fuels. The system investigation illustrates that filter pore size, area, flow rate, and fuel charge were important variables and that properly designed and placed components can significantly influence the temperature to which fuels can be pumped. The study showed that very small amounts (2-5 percent) of frozen hydrocarbons can cause filter plugging and that the presence of insoluble fuel products at low temperatures also contribute to the problem. The program also pointed out that the aromatic portion of the fuel can be as much at fault as the saturates. The paper emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the relationship of the hydro- 109</page><page sequence="51">660371-660377 carbon group and sub-group composition in estab- lishing low temperature fuel behavior. 1967 SAE Transactions 660371 . Dimensions of Diesel Fuel Performance: Design, Depressants, and Response. B. L. Mickel, American Oil Co., and L. D. Fergesen, Amoco Chemicals Corp. The ability of a diesel vehicle to utilize the improved cold flow properties imparted by pour depressant additives depends upon fuel system design and fuel type. The most critical part of the diesel fuel feed system is the suction filter or screen. Pour point de- pressants, when used in responsive fuels, delay blocking of this filter by wax. In a well-designed sys- tem, depressants extend the warmup period suffi- ciently to permit continued operation. At the thresh- old temperature for unsatisfactory operating condi- tions, the extra margin provided by depressants can be all important. 660372. Role of Flow Improvers in Solving Auto- diesel Winter Fuel Problems. K. A. Bey- reis, V. P. Catto, and E. S. Swanson, Jr., Enjay Chemical Labs. Flow improved fuel was shown to be highly effec- tive in providing good low temperature performance in autodiesels. At Bemidji, Minn., a controlled field test demonstrated that in terms of autodiesel opera- bility at low temperatures flow improved fuel is equal to or better than lower cloud kerosene diluted fuel. It was also found that fuel system design fea- tures could affect low temperature operations. Two commercial truck fleets, using flow improved fuel in the northern Midwest, had completely satisfac- tory winter operations.

Measurement and Evaluation of Sur- faces By Evaporative Rate Analysis III Quality of Seal on Anodized Aluminum. J. L. Anderson, Cleanometer Corp. First studies of the quality of seal of anodized alum- inum through measurement and evaluation of the surface by evaporative rate analysis of an added test solution showed a generally orderly response; that is, the greater the extent of seal, the more rapid the evaporation of the test material. However, more de- tailed studies have shown some marked anomalies in evaporative response; quantitative data are pre- sented herein for the first time. The evidence pre- sented indicates that even modest high humitity aging of nonboil sealed surfaces is superior to any boil sealing insofar as desorptive phenomena are con- cerned. 660374. Some Factors Affecting the Response of Anodized Aluminum to the CASS Test. C. E. Michelson, D. C. Montgomery, and P. D. Str√°nsk√Ω, Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp. New experimental evidence shows that most corro- sion sites observed on CASS tested panels are sites of cathodic activity during the initial stages, and that the anodic areas are probably largely confined to the edges in the early part of the exposure. Most of the deterioration is due to action of high pH run- down associated with cathodic activity. Continued cathodic activity and consequent deterioration of the anodic coating produce additional anodes in the im- mediate vicinity of many of the cathodes. Surface impairments, metal defects, and conditions of aging between finishing and testing affect the amount of deterioration during CASS exposure. 1967 SAE Transactions 660375.

Dobie, United States Rubber Tire Co. During the last five years 2-ply tires have replaced 4- ply in a very substantial percentage of all passenger tire production. This move was primarily motivated by the improved performance potential of the 2-ply construction with particular reference to extended high speed driving. This paper reviews the engin- eering principles involved and includes a perform- ance comparison on controlled laboratory and prov- ing ground tests. It also includes a comprehensive performance history comparing 2-ply versus 4-ply on millions of tires produced during this five year per- iod. The results leave no doubt that the 2-ply tire has proven itself superior to the 4-ply on an overall basis. 1967 SAE Transactions 660379. Hydrodynamic Sealing with Radial Lip Seals. L. H. Weinand, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Conventional radial lip oil seals can be made more effective by utilizing helical grooving beneath the contact lip surface. Miniature hydrodynamic pumps so formed aid the radial lip seal in containing the oil by generating fluid forces opposite in direction to the leakage flow forces. This seal-shaft combination has been termed the Hydroseal. Four factorial experi- ments were conducted to evaluate the effect of helix angle, groove depth, groove width, and number of grooves on sealing performance. The criterion used as a basis for selecting the optimum design were leakage, wear, hardening of the sealing surface, and pumping capacity. These data indicated that the best hydroseal design was one with three grooves, 0.0003 in. deep, 0.014 in. wide, having a helix angle of 45 deg. 1967 SAE Transactions 660380. Optimum Lip Seal Design by Fractional Factorial Experimentation. J. D. Sy- mons, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The multitude of lip section designs and the con- tinued major automotive warranty problem in the field of radial oil seals indicated that a more thorough knowledge of lip section design was necessary. Seven design factors were investigated by means of fractional factorial experimentation to determine the optimum level for each of the factors. The general ef- fects of trim diameter, radial lip force, seal lip to 660378-660387 case eccentricity, spring position, contact width, flex section, and material modulus, plus the interactions between these seven factors, were investigated. Leakage was measured as the response or dependent variable. A detailed drawing of the optimum lip sec- tion, derived from the results of tests which opti- mized on the main effects only, is given.

Although tests were conducted on these models at quarterscale Rey- nolds number, results agree closely with similar tests on larger models. Balance makes practical unusual preliminary investigations before developing full- scale prototypes. 660385. Some Problems Concerning Wind Tun- nel Testing of Automotive Vehicles. D. S. Gross and W. S. Sekscienski, Maryland Univ. Some of the techniques used in wind tunnel testing of automotive vehicle models are discussed. The cur- rent problems and unknowns are presented with comparative data when available. Aerodynamic lift is shown to be the most sensitive and uncertain of the aerodynamic components. 1967 SAE Transactions 660387. Aerodynamic Drag Characteristics of Land Speed Record Vehicles. A. S. Tre- mulis, Tuscan Motor Co., Inc. An analysis is presented of several existing land 111</page><page sequence="53">660388-660394 speed record cars and the aerodynamic drag charac- teristics involved in attaining the speed of sound. The importance of minimum profile area is discussed with the implications that the two wheel tandem principle presents the ultimate form for land speed record attempts achieving Mach I speeds. 660388. Body Aerodynamics and Heater Air Flow. R. W. Shirk, Chrysler Corp. The heater air flow rate is a function not only of the heater itself but also of the size and location of the heater system air inlets, the car body air outlets, and the body surface pressure at these inlets and outlets. Favorable pressure conditions generally exist at the typical top cowl heater air inlet; however, the aero- dynamics of each particular vehicle should be studied to confirm the existence of these conditions. Little consideration has been given to body air outlet pressure conditions since body leakage paths have generally served as adequate air outlets; but, as body leakage is reduced, specific air outlets must be con- sidered and a knowledge of aerodynamics is essen- tial to the achieving of appropriately sized and ap- propriately located air outlets. 660389. Generalizations on the Aerodynamic Characteristics of Sedan Type Automo- bile Bodies. William D. Bowman, Ford Motor Co. A set of empirical equations are offered which de- fine the variation of aerodynamic coefficients with yaw angle for sedan-type automobile bodies. These are derived from wind tunnel tests on % size models of twenty-one automobile body forms, of which sev- enteen were production car specimens. The results show that while body form and features exert deci- sive influence on numerical values of force and mo- ment coefficients, their mode of variation with yaw angle is independent of body shape and size. 1967 SAE Transactions 660390. Aerodynamic Design of the Goldenrod -To Increase Stability, Traction, and Speed. W. H. Korff, Lockheed-California Co. A major consideration for world land speed record automobiles is the influence of aerodynamic design on traction, stability, and speed. The features of the successful Goldenrod are described through prelim- inary design, wind tunnel testing, modifications, per- formance calculations, and vehicle tests on the Bonneville Salt Flats. These features include lowest minimum drag coefficient (0.1165); download (nega- tive lift) from the shape of the basic body alone; and high-speed stability without the addition of hori- zontal or vertical fins, spoilers, or weight (ballast). Design requirements were achieved by the model in wind tunnel tests and the car performed as predicted by these tests, setting a new world record in third gear. The Goldenrod appears to have sufficient po- tential to also challenge the world speed record for piston engined aircraft. 660391. Design and Construction of Improved Flasher Testing Apparatus. G. R. Smith, D. R. Dunlop, and D. M. Finch, California Univ. This report describes equipment designed and built in the Motor Vehicle Devices Testing Facility of the California Highway Patrol, and used to increase laboratory capacity for testing of automotive signal flashers. The new durability test apparatus is capa- ble of handling two or three terminal flashers in groups of 80 at one time, and uses two electronically regulated, solid state power supplies as sources of stable d-c power. The performance test apparatus makes it possible to obtain the operating character- istics of 10 flashers in quick succession through use of a switching control unit and a strip chart recorder. 660392. Reliability Testing of Signal Flashers. Thomas K. Brichford and James W. Mur- ray, Ford Motor Co., Metal Stamping Div. Determining the actual usage and environment to which a turn signal flasher is exposed made it possi- ble to design a laboratory test from which predic- tions could be made of flasher reliability as installed in a vehicle. A simplified reliability test plan was also devised for monitoring production flashers which permits valid conclusions to be reached by personnel not acquainted with statistics. 660393. Caterpillar's 1676 Truck Engine. H. D. Harms, Industrial Div., Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. Late in 1965, Caterpillar introduced its 1676, a 340 hp diesel truck engine of completely new design. Construction details of this compact engine which features turbocharging, after-cooling, and four valves per cylinder are illustrated and described. Develop- ment problems and performance of the production engine are also presented. 660394. Some Development Aspects of Two- Stroke Cycle Motorcycle Engines. H. Naito and M. Taguchi, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes aspects of Yamaha 2 cycle, high speed, high output engines. Generally speak- ing, in order to obtain good results in developing en- gine performance, high delivery ratios and high ther- 112</page><page sequence="54">mal and mechanical efficiencies are essential. In ad- dition to these, the most suitable cooling and lubri- cating systems must be employed. Yamaha has de- veloped a separate and automatic lubrication system for 2-cycle gasoline engines, which keeps Yamaha engines well lubricated. Discussion: W. J. Harley, Harley-Davidson Motor Co.; G.

Study of the Effects of Automotive Fluids on Elastomer Seal Materials Us- ing Immersion Tests. B. C. Vandermar, Western Felt Wks.; and G. A. Ilkka, Gen- eral Motors Res. Labs. Effective performance of functional automotive com- ponents requires fluid sealing under compatible conditions. One method of determining this compat- ibility is through the use of immersion testing under a variety of conditions that simulate those experi- enced in actual use. By measuring the changes in the physical properties of the seal materials after immersion a judgment can be made regarding seal/ fluid compatibility which will be encountered later in actual use. A series of immersion tests using rep- resentative seal materials and automotive fluids; namely, gear oils, transmission fluids, and motor oils were conducted within the framework of the 4 Technical Committee on Automotive Rubber, jointly sponsored by SAE-ASTM. 1967 SAE Transactions 660396. Evaluating the Effect of Fluids on Auto- matic Transmission Rotating Shaft Seal Elastomers. G. A. Peters and J. J. Rodgers, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The Total Immersion Test (ASTM D 471) for seal elastomers, used in evaluating the compatibility of fluids and seals for automatic transmissions, does not produce hardness and volume change results similar to those found for rotating shaft seals in service. The Tip Cycle Test was devised to provide better agree- ment with service results. In the test, one side of the seal is exposed to air, and the other alternately to fluid and to air fluid vapor. Rotating shaft seals were evaluated in both car and dynamometer transmission tests, and in various bench tests. Agreement was poor between transmission tests and both the Total Im- mersion and the Dip Cycle Tests. Good agreement was found with the Tip Cycle Test. 660397. Fluid Composition Affects Leakage from Automatic Transmissions. M. C. Goodwin, J. J. Rodgers, and G. A. Peters, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Tests were conducted using older model cars with 660395-660400 automatic transmissions to determine the effect of fluid composition on leakage past the rotating shaft seals. It was found that seal leakage was reduced or stopped by changing to seal-swelling fluids, and in- creased with seal-shrinking fluids. Leakage was also reduced by adding aromatic additives to existing fluids in the transmissions. Seal volume and hard- ness change results from bench tests support the car data. 660398. Brake Balance - It Can Be Improved. R. J. Morse, Bendix-Westinghouse Auto- motive Air Brake Co. Two means of making substantial improvements in brake balance are discussed. The first, the use of dynamic rather than static weights in braking power calculations has greatest value on loaded vehicles. Dynamic weights existing at 0.3 g deceleration are proposed as a standard. The second, load propor- tioned braking, is helpful on empty vehicles but must be used on all axles which have a substantial change in weight from the empty to the loaded con- dition. If used on only one unit of a combination ve- hicle, it may have a detrimental effect on brake bal- ance. 660399. Dynamic Brake Balance Via the Com- puter. W. D. Noon, G. L. Smith, and P. A. Bochnig, Truck and Coach Div., General Motors Corp. The evaluation of commercial vehicle brake system balance is a complex analytical task. Tractor-trailer combinations frequently include different brake designs on different axles, which have widely vary- ing characteristics. In addition, variations in brake parameters such as pressure, response times, linings, and heat transfer under various operating conditions add to the complexity of analyzing the brake system. This paper describes a mathematical model of the vehicle brake system and a program for a digital computer to solve the mathematical expressions. Us- ing the computer to simulate dynamic brake system operation, current designs can be evaluated rapidly for effectiveness and possible improvement, and future designs can be analized prior to expensive prototype fabrication. 1967 SAE Transactions 660400.

Automatic Assembly of Differentials at Pontiac. R. W. Laile, Pontiac Motor Div., GMC. This paper describes four integrated, index type, parallel lines with intermixed manual and automatic operations used at Pontiac Motor Division to as- semble rear axle differentials. Automatic pinion bearing preloading, gaging of pinion cone distance, gaging of side bearing shims, heating of ring gear bore, spreading of carrier, and on the line testing are the main features of this machine. Quality has im- proved through automatic gaging and the ability to perform automatic operations while the parts are stationary. Significant manpower reductions have been made possible with this automated assembly, which has a production gross of 270 assemblies per hour. 1967 SAE Transactions 660403.

Sterling Plant are: automatic gaging for proper bearing preload; au- tomatic check of pinion torque; automatic run-out and freeness of pinion and universal joint assembly; combination station to feed out the differential pin- ion shaft, press it into the case, feed and drive in the roll pin; automatic bolt inspection; automated bolt feed into case and run down to proper torque; and automatic removal of doweled bearing cap. 1967 SAE Transactions 660404. Effects of Some Engine Variables and Control Systems on Composition and Reactivity of Exhaust Hydrocarbons. M. W. Jackson, Res. Labs., General Mo- tors Corp. The effects of air-fuel ratio, spark timing, an engine modification system, and the Air Injection Reactor System on the composition and reactivity of the ex- haust hydrocarbons are reported. The reactivity in- dex and composition changes are compared to those indicated by the nondispersive infrared analyzer. Either retarding the spark timing or leaning the air- fuel ratio reduced the hydrocarbon concentration measured by the infrared analyzer. Discussion: C. M. Heinen, Chrysler Corp.; John A.

The tedious, time consuming task of hand reducing data from the California exhaust emission test has been alleviated through the use of digital data acqui- sition equipment and a digital computer. Analog signals from exhaust gas analyzers and an engine speed transducer are converted to digital measure- ments which are recorded on tape and submitted to a digital computer for data analysis and computation of results. In the data analysis, the computer identi- fies the required driving modes from engine speed changes, taking into account the sample delay time. 660407. Determining the Amount and Composi- tion of Evaporation Losses from Auto- motive Fuel Systems. H. L. Muller, R. E. Kay and T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co. The amount of vapors lost from an automobile fuel system is determined from changes in density of the gasoline as it weathers. The composition of the va- pors lost is calculated from the initial composition of the fuel by simple distillation theory. The tech- niques are simple, precise, and generally applicable.

Investigations into the Composition of End Gases from Otto Cycle Engines. M. Alperstein and R. L. Bradow, Texaco, Inc. Techniques are described for determining the chem- ical nature of the end gas in a normally fired CFR otto cycle engine. Apparatus for obtaining and chro- matographically analyzing representative end-gas samples is described, and its utility illustrated using isoctane as a fuel. Twenty-seven carbon containing slow combustion products were identified before flame arrival; these consist principally of olefins, ring ethers, carbonyls, CO, and C02. Product forma- tion is shown to increase with increasing pressure and temperature stress and to be inhibited by octane number appreciating additives. Distinct product for- mation trends from the slow combustion of isoctane were observed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660411. Approach to Load Sensing Brake Pro- portioning for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks. R. T. Eddy, Bendix Pro- ducts Auto. Div., and R. A. Wilson, Res. Labs Div., Bendix Corp. Load sensing brake proportioning is a means of op- timizing the ratio of front-to-rear wheel retarding forces for the full range of vehicle loadings and de- celerations. A relatively simple system of providing two-axled vehicles with improved brake balance has been developed. Simulation studies of vehicle brake system requirements, effects of a pressure reg- ulating device used to implement these require- ments, and the resulting improvements are com- pared in actual tests of vehicle and hardware.

Automotive brake lining is a complex composite of organic resin binder, asbestos fiber reinforcement, and friction modifying fillers. The battery of labora- tory and vehicle tests used to select and qualify spe- cific formulations for use on each car line is time- consuming and not generally suitable for quality control. A new integrated system of tests is therefore proposed. The tests are X-ray radiography and opti- cal resinography for structural definition; thermal analysis for chemical composition and state of cure; and a short sliding friction (drag) test utilizing the widely available SAE J661 friction materials test machine for friction level and fade temperature.

Procedures for designing and evaluating a tandem truck driveline are presented here in a form that re- quires only basic algebra and trigonometry for using the graphs, illustrations, and tables. Phasing of a two joint driveline with the joints in two different planes, angular velocity relationship, and prediction of uni- versal joint bearing life are all expressed in simple equations. Important design considerations are pre- sented for the spline, tube and cross. Stress formulas and fatigue curves tnat provide technical assistance to a designer for these components are illustrated and explained. 1967 SAE Transactions 660415. Truck Driveline Slip. J. R. Young, Uni- versal Joint Div., Rockwell-Standard Corp. Slip (or axial length change) is almost required where universal joints are used to transmit power. Universal joints permit angular or offset misalign- ment while transmitting torque between power source and power user. Truck drive trains may use universal joints to connect any or all components be- tween the engines, transmissions, auxiliary trans- missions, transfer cases, axles, or axle wheels. Length variations during operation may be intentional for design function or unavoidable. These relative movements in trucks are generally allowed by a sliding section in the driveline. This paper will dis- cuss prevalent conditions, current state-of-the-art, and what may be in the offing for the future. 115</page><page sequence="57">660416-660424 660416. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Marine Safety- Some of the Problems and Sug- gested Solutions. W. J. Webb, Outboard Marine Corp., Evinrude Motors Div. It is the responsibility of the boating industry to make certain that its marine products are designed and manufactured to operate safely and under almost all conceivable conditions. It is also the industry's responsibility to educate boat operators and the gen- eral public in common sense boating practices. How- ever, in attempting to improve boating's safety rec- ord, it must be remembered that in the final analy- sis if the boat operator does not use good judgment or comply with the law, then all the engineering im- provements, educational programs, and efficient law enforcement will not prevent boating accidents. 660417. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Educa- tion of Pleasure Boat Operators. Ken- neth B. Champ, United States Power Squadrons. The avowed purpose of the U.S. Power Squadrons is to educate small boat users in safe boating practices and to inform participants in water activities on how to properly enjoy water sports and at the same time respect the rights of others. Over 350 local Squadrons situated across the country offer various courses at no charge to the public covering such diverse sub- jects as small boat handling, charts, piloting, rules of the road, and even celestial navigation. It is un- fortunate that not enough persons are aware of this program, and of those who do register for classes, many do not complete the courses in which they en- rolled. 660418. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Problems in Education of Pleasure Boat Opera- tors. Joseph V. Day, United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. The boating safety education program of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary is designed to reach both ex- perienced recreational boaters as well as novices. The problems inherent in trying to convince boat users of the need for comprehensive knowledge cov- ering all aspects of boating safety are many and varied. They include the need for increased publi- city on the courses and programs offered by the Aux- iliary; a larger instructor corps; and suitable space in which to present its educational courses. 660419. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Federal Safe Boating Legislation. David Oliver, United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard approach to Federal safe boating legislation is both cautious and comprehensive. Its part in promoting safe boating, both through legisla- tion and enforcement, is discussed, with emphasis on the continuing need for close liaison with state administrators, industry representatives, industry associations, marine trade groups, and of course the boating public. 660420.

(SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: State Safe Boating Legislation. James A. Had- ley, Michigan Conservation Dept. The Federal Boating Act of 1958 provides for coordi- nated Federal-state recreational boating safety pro- grams. Today 46 states have passed legislation deal- ing with recreational boating. However, many of the operating and equipment requirements vary distinct- ly from both the Federal requirements and those of neighboring states. Of the various solutions which have been proposed to alleviate this confusing situa- tion, it would appear that the most sensible is the development of uniformity in boating laws, rules, and regulations. The necessary steps in order to ac- complish such uniformity are outlined. 660422. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Motiva- tion Is the Key to Effective Law Enforce- ment. Gordon H. Dickman, United States Coast Guard. Recruiting, training, and motivating marine law en- forcement officers to effectively perform their mis- sion is vital if results are to be achieved in boating safety. Since boating laws cover an extremely diverse field and by necessity are set forth in very broad lan- guage, the marine law enforcement officer must use considerable judgment and discretion in applying laws and regulations and in dealing with offenders. But above all, his work must be recognized by both the courts and the public as being an important ad- junct to boating safety. 660424.

A few of the speci- fic problems for which some new recommended BIA practices offer solutions are described in such areas as electrical systems, fuel systems, compartment ventilation, steering systems, and boat capacity. The overall goal of BIA recommended practices is to enable manufacturers to build better performing and safer products for the public through pooled in- dustry judgment. 660426. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Develop- ment of Safety Standards for Small Craft by American Boat and Yacht Council. Harper H. Hull, Trojan Boat Co. The American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to supply the boat manufacturing industry with safe- ty standards for pleasure craft. Tentative standards first developed by the Technical Members of the Council are widely disseminated throughout the industry for comment. Only after all comments and suggestions are resolved is the standard finally adopted. Adopted standards thus represent the best thinking of the majority of the boating industry. Standards are keyed to the safety of life at sea and vessel safety and durability. 660427. (SP-281) Pleasure Boat Safety: Power Train and Accessory Standards. Elmer P. Jasper, Chris-Craft Corp.

The Yacht Safety Bureau is an independent, non- profit, public service organization engaged only in testing for public safety in the boating field. The test- ing services are for end products only. Its object is to make certain that marine equipment measured for safe operation performs as intended. In order to ac- complish this, the Bureau's safety evaluation pro- gram provides a reference base to which the meas- urement of a product can be related (safety testing standards), the means for accomplishing the meas- urement (safety testing), and the means for informing the public that the measurement has been met (pro- duct listing and labeling). 660430.

In this paper, the effects of fluctuating torque on loosening of a tightly seated bolt are investigated. Tests over a wide range of bolt stresses and loosen- ing torques are reported and equipment developed for determination of such effects is described. It is shown that a definite functional relationship exists between the stress on a typical bolt, the oscillatory loosening torque that is applied, and the number of cycles before the bolt becomes loose. The effects of these relationships follow a clearly defined law, although they are, of course, influenced by a number of additional variables. 660433. Strength of Bolted Assemblies Sub- jected to Combined Dynamic Loads. C. S. Larson and E. I. Radzimovsky, Illin- ois Univ. This paper deals with the study of the strength con- ditions of bolted assemblies subjected to various types of repeated loads. The loads considered are repeated axial loads, repeated bending loads, and repeated combined loads, which are composed of axial and bending loads. A rational equation of the strength of a bolted assembly is suggested in order to express the conditions that exist when such an as- sembly is subjected to conditions of combined dyna- mic loading. 1967 SAE Transactions 660434.

Practical Applications of Truck Body Mountings. Robert. C. Anthony, Chevro- let Motor Div., G.M.C. Body mounting system selection must consider the following: 1. Body structure indicates that body mounts should be positioned outboard for optimum utiliza- tion of available rim strength. 2. Frame twist indicates that body mountings should be modified in board for body relief. 3. Frame beaming is not a serious problem except when combined with frame pitching. Long wheel- base school bus models pose a special beaming prob- lem. 4. Frame shock loading through mounts results from frame pitching and calls for soft, widespread mounting systems to produce the best body durabil- ity. 5. Cushion locations indicate optimum design to be a modified 6-point, wide spaced mounting system. 6. Cushion rate must tune out noise and vibration, but the low rate mount cure must not be incorporated at the expense of excessive cab motion. Allowable body motion should hinge to frame at cab rear mounting. 7. Cushion type recommends a long look at the versatile compression-rebound mounts before turn- ing to alternate design types. 8. Cushion size is most important from the stand- point of cushion durability. Durable cushions insure body durability. 9. Cushion damping is a worthy objective with energy absorbing benefits clearly discernible in lower rate mountings. 660439.

The S-IVB must satisfy two different sets of vehicle constraints: (1) as a second stage for the Saturn IB launch vehicle; and (2) as a third stage with restart capability for the Saturn V launch vehicle. A com- parison between these missions is presented. Since upper stages generally contribute more kinetic en- ergy to the payload, they are more critical than lower stages from a performance tradeoff aspect. Initially, space launch vehicles were single-burn devices, with mission times measured in minutes. The cur- rent S-IVB mission time encompasses more than 6Y2 hr, a significant portion of which is in a near-zero g environment. This operational requirement imposes severe demands on stage design. Resulting problem areas are identified, and solutions are described. 660442. Adaptation of the Saturn S-II for a Ground Launch Stage Installation of Solid Rocket Motors. John W. Sandford and G. Fraser, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Mission studies have indicated that a launch vehicle payload capability void exists between the Saturn I-B and Saturn V vehicles. The S-II and S-IVB stages of the Saturn V were investigated to determine the feasibility of utilizing them to satisfy the capability void. To obtain low earth-orbital payloads in the range of 75,000-150,000 lb, it is necessary to aug- ment the S-II stage thrust. The paper discusses the application of Minuteman first-stage or Titan III-C type 120-in. strap-on solid rocket motors to provide the additional thrust to the intermediate vehicle comprised of the S-II and S-IVB. Included is a def- inition of the candidate vehicle configurations utiliz- ing these solid motors and a definition of the stage modifications. The payload performance and control characteristics of the intermediate vehicles are sum- marized. The impact of the intermediate vehicle on the total ground systems including launch from KSC is reviewed and utilized as the basis for developing cost efficiencies of the various configurations. The results presented in this paper were developed as an element of the company sponsored research of the growth and alternate applications of the Saturn S-II stage. 1967 SAE Transactions 660443. Next-Generation Lunar Transports. J. O. Matzenauer, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. This paper illustrates some potentials or possible trends in future-generation spacecraft for advanced lunar missions. The need for multiman crew trans- ports is presented and the operational disadvantages of the lunar orbital mission mode are described. Pos- sibilities for landing multiman crews in the direct 660441-660446 mission mode are presented; booster system require- ments and state of the art in necessary subsystems have been considered. For comparison, the ad- vanced lunar orbital rendezvous mode spacecraft is also shown. This spacecraft can land twice as many men per launch; however, operational restric- tions and greater cost due to complexity make it ap- pear less desirable. 660444. Atlas E/F Launch Vehicle Research and Development Capabilities. John G. Kalo- geris, General Dynamics/Convair. Atlas boosters, their cost having been long written- off, can be provided for relatively low modification and launch service cost. Certain standard refurbish- ments have been identified to update and/or recycle components, and modification and installation of individual payload-peculiar requirements have been accomplished. The Atlas modified boosters are equipped with all-inertial guidance systems; radio- inertial guidance may easily be installed to replace the all-inertial system with minor hardware changes to the Atlas subsystems. Simplified fabrication and tooling techniques allow removal of thin skins and replacement of heavier tank sections for higher aero- dynamic heating (lower trajectories) and/or heavier payloads (8000- to 36,000-lb) capability. 660445. Advanced Atlas Launch Vehicles. Rob- ert J. Voth and Joseph P. Moore, III, Gen- eral Dynamics/Convair. The Atlas family meets the increased payload re- quirements of the next decade with maximum cost effectiveness by: (1) uprating the SLV-3; (2) using mission compatible upper stages; (3) incorporating sustainer tank apogee kick concept; (4) augmenting thrust with strap-on motors; and (5) performing mul- tiple missions with a single launch vehicle. 660446. Practical Ferry-Resupply with the Titan III. Robert H. Lea, Martin Co., Denver Div. Practical considerations for an efficient ferry-re- supply system are emphasized in this paper. Titan III performance capabilities are briefly reviewed, and the influence orbit characteristics have on ferry- resupply rendezvous is discussed. Logistic mission sensitivity to orbit altitude and inclination para- meters as they affect payload, frequency of launch opportunity and phasing requirements is evaluated. The capability of launching on time and the ability to respond rapidly to a supply mission abort or scrub was found to be a prime system prerequisite. Advan- tages of a mobile launch system with back-up capa- bility are clearly established. 119</page><page sequence="61">660447-660454 660447. Titan III Building Blocks and Their Ap- plication. Wayne B. Leslie and Glen J. Dickman, Martin Co., Denver Div. All elements of the basic Titan III system have been successfully operated at the midway point of the re- search and development flight program. The basic features demonstrated (flight with and without solid rockets, quick and unrestricted reaction time, flexi- ble flight programming) are proving to be the base on which a large family of building blocks can be erected, permitting rapid and inexpensive matching of tailored booster capability with specific mission objectives. 660448. High Energy Missions for Saturn. T. J. Gordon and D. D. Wheeler, Douglas Air- craft Co., Inc. Saturn V is scheduled to carry the unmanned Voy- ager payload to the planet Mars. There are also im- portant high energy scientific missions in which Sat- urn hardware can be employed, including cometary intercepts, probes to the asteroids, solar probes, flights out of the ecliptic, flights to the earth-moon libration points, and probes out of the solar system. Significant improvement in escape payload capa- bility can be achieved by placing the escape velocity stages in orbit via Saturn V and elements of the pay- load in orbit with Saturn V or other boost vehicles. 660449. Lunar Scientific Missions. W. D. Mc- Kaig, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Scientific investigations which can be performed with a Lunar Exploration System for Apollo (LESA) base system are briefly described. Operational and logistics requirements for support of the scientific investigations and missions are discussed. Desirable lunar base deployment and typical installations are presented and are summarized in an illustration showing the concept of an alternate base configura- tion. 1967 SAE Transactions 660450. Technology Escalation for Potential Missions. Fritz C. Runge, Douglas Air- craft Co., Inc. The year-to-year destiny of individual technology projects is sensitive to changes in potential mission popularity. Variations in mission popularity create upward or downward funding escalations in asso- ciated technology projects and thus inefficiencies. Effective approaches to minimizing the harmful ef- fects of such escalations are based mostly on an early and disciplined analysis of relative challenges, priorities and resource applications. 660451. "Zero Stage" for the Saturn IB Launch Vehicle. Vaino J. Vehko and William E. Ruhland, Chrysler Corp., Space Div. One of the more attractive methods of providing in- creased payload capability for the Saturn IB is dis- cussed in this paper. Four 120-inch United Tech- nology Center UA-1205 solid-propellant motors, ori- ginally developed for the Air Force Titan III pro- gram, are clustered around the S-IB first stage of the Saturn IB launch vehicle. These four solid-propel- lant motors provide the total thrust for liftoff of the vehicle, with S-IB stage ignition occurring just prior to burn-out and separation of the solid-propellant motors. "Zero Stage" is applied to this added stage to obviate the need for renumbering the stages. 1967 SAE Transactions 660452. Reusability- the Next Major Launch Vehicle Development. John S. Knaur, Boeing Co., Space Div. This paper addresses itself to the question of what direction launch vehicle development activity should proceed after Saturn V/Apollo. Development problems are identified, and a logical launch system development program is suggested. The space pro- grams for the next two decades are identified; launch vehicle economic and operational alternatives are explored; and particularly, the place reusability may have in future launch vehicle development is examined. Five basic vehicle alternatives are con- sidered: (1) existing expendable boosters; (2) exist- ing expendable boosters uprated; (3) new expend- able boosters; (4) expendable boosters modified for recovery and reuse; and (5) new reusable vehicles. 1967 SAE Transactions 660453. Selected Methods for Uprating Saturn Vehicles. Alfred G. Orillion and Ronald D. Scott, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. This paper will discuss selected methods for in- creasing the Saturn launch vehicle payload capabili- ties. These methods involve system changes or addi- tions that give large step performance increases over those which can be obtained by product improve- ments. The selected philosophy of approach and the established designed systems will be described, as well as anticipated system concepts that may be used to increase the Saturn vehicles' capabilities. 660454. Propellant Tanking Computer System. N. L. Hoecker and J. M. Mathewson, Gen- eral Elee. Co. Objectives of the Saturn Program have necessitated a more accurate knowledge of the vehicle mass and lift-off weight. Since propellants constitute the major 120</page><page sequence="62">portion of the vehicle mass, a method of accurately determining and regulating the quantity of propel- lants on board the vehicle is a primary requirement. Several elements are involved in providing accurate on-board quantities of vehicle propellants. Of most significance are the vehicle propellants sensors, stor- age and transfer facilities, and a system to monitor the sensors and control the transfer facilities. 660455. Application of Gas-Film-Cooled Nozzle Extensions to Large Rocket Engines. J. E. Erbs and R. R. Stickling, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Rocketdyne Div. During the F-l rocket engine program, turbine ex- haust gases have been successfully used to film cool large thrust chamber nozzle extensions. This design concept provides the engine with a detachable noz- zle of low weight, simple construction, and a service life equivalent to that of the basic engine. Several nozzle extension concepts are reviewed, and a com- parison is made in terms of operational advantages and engine application as defined by required nozzle geometry, heat flux, and available coolant. The par- ticular application for which the gas-cooled concept is the most desirable engineering choice, is dis- cussed in detail. Experimental data obtained during development are presented with particular emphasis given thermal analysis considerations. 1967 SAE Transactions 660458. MQAF Titanium Alloys and Titanium Bi-Alloy Composites. Stanley Abkowitz, Textron Inc., Nuclear Metals Div. The micro-quenched, age-formed process involves the use of high-purity spherical particles produced by a rotating electrode which are consolidated to wrought product by extrusion. Since the particles exist in the rapidly quenched condition (essentially solution-treated), the consolidation must be carried out at temperature equal to or below the aging tem- perature. Results show that essentially single-phase alpha alloys with minor beta, suchas Ti-7Al-2Cb-lTa, or lean (in beta) alpha-beta alloys such as T√ç-6A1-4V, exhibit high heat-treated strength regardless of sec- tion size. Weld ductility of these alloys is comparable with the same alloys of lower strength produced con- ventionally. 1967 SAE Transactions 660459. Graphics in Design Engineering. W. H. Sass, International Business Machs. Corp. Man and computer can work together on the design of complex components and systems using graphic input/output devices. Man-oriented I/O devices such as light pens, keyboards and displays extend the capabilities of man and computer in evolving a 660455-660461 design. Typical design problems include a large volume of data, a profusion of calculations, interre- lated decisions, and iterative operations - all read- ily processed by a computer. These problems also contain creative analytical or job coordination tasks which can be performed best by skilled human spec- ialists. The graphic interface permits "conversa- tional" communication between the specialist (fre- quently an engineer) and the computing equipment, in the form or a symbolic language having both pic- torial and alphameric elements. Such a language is currently the medium for engineering thought, ex- pression and documentation. This closer man-ma- chine rapport allows the computer to aid the design- er to aid the computer to perform tasks beyond its preprogrammed capability. 660460. Studies in Advanced Space Vehicle Containers. J. G. Blumrich, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. Studies concerning advanced container design are necessary for two reasons: Prolonged storage time of cryogenic liquids, and the need for improved container configurations. Anticipated storage times range from a few weeks to many months. Both the effect of low temperatures as well as stringent in- sulation requirements influence the design of the tank and its support structure. Necessary protection against micrometeoroids and reusability require- ments add complications which are in need of solu- tions. Improvement of container configurations is essential for economical reasons. Shorter tanks, that is, mean shorter vehicles, reduced bending mo- ments, higher vehicle frequencies - advantages which go far beyond the tanks themselves. Even if no length or weight reductions are achieved, reduced manufacturing costs are certainly also a desirable re- sult. Other containers, such as crew compartments, can be designed to offer more volume without in- creased stage length. 660461 . On-Board Checkout for Advanced Space Missions. J. M. Miller and J. H. Pehrson, Boeing Co. The requirements for on-board checkout for ad- vanced space missions are identified and an on-board checkout system capable of meeting the require- ments is defined. The development of a major hard- ware element of the defined system is discussed. Application of advanced design technology to the developed hardware has permitted substantial capa- bility to be incorporated on board advanced mission vehicles with very little weight, volume and power consumption penalty. The on-board checkout sys- tem software development and application are des- cribed. 121</page><page sequence="63">660462-660468 660462. Further Uprating of Saturn I for Mis- sions of the Future. David N. Buell, and Albert S. Schnyder, Chrysler Corp., Space Div. The uprated Saturn I (Saturn IB) Launch Vehicle is discussed, its mission capability described, and it is shown to be suitable for additional missions requir- ing increased payload weights falling within the payload gap between the uprated Saturn I and Saturn V launch vehicles. Several attractive methods of providing increased payload together with the vari- ous methods of vehicle uprating that have been studied by Chrysler Corp. Space Division and NASA are presented. These methods include propellant substitution, S-IB stage propellant tank extensions, and the addition of strap-on solid propellant rocket motors for thrust augmentation. Additional upper stages are discussed as potential uprating tech- niques. Combinations of solid rocket motors and ad- ditional upper stages are reviewed. The paper con- cludes with a discussion of the capability of the vari- ous uprated configurations. Chrysler's analysis shows that uprating is feasible up to 106,000 lb pay- load into low earth orbit and up to 25,000 lb on a Mars mission. 660463. Some Trends in Future Launch Vehicle Systems Technology. Harold Hornby, and C. D. Havill, Ames Res. Center, NASA. Launch vehicle and spacecraft cost trends are exam- ined. It is shown that lower unit costs are obtained for larger vehicles. Intermediate Saturn vehicles are examined. Saturn I-B evolutes using solid rockets are able to bridge much of the payload and cost ef- fectiveness gaps between the Saturn I-B and Saturn V. Post Saturn vehicles are examined. Trends toward single stage to orbit are indicated. One and a half stage vehicles consisting of solid or liquid rockets parallel stage to liquid core offer enhanced reliabil- ity and considerable payload flexibility. Performance is improved in these configurations by throttling. Reusable launch vehicles are examined as a trend for the late seventies or the decade of the 1980's. Turn-around costs are indicated as the key to econo- mic attractiveness for such reusable launch vehicles. 1967 SAE Transactions 660464. Aerodynamic Test Techniques. J. C. Kessler, and S. B. Wallis, Ford Motor Co. This paper contains detailed explanations and criti- cisms of aerodynamic tests conducted for the auto- motive industry. Using 1/10, 3/8, and full scale ve- hicles, tests were conducted for aerodynamic drag and lift, stability and control, pressure distribution, and flow visualization. Tests were conducted in wind tunnels and on the road. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and ex- plained at length. 660465. U.S. Coast Guard 44 Ft Motor Lifeboat. Robert W. Witter, United States Coast Guard. Because of various factors, the replacement of the Coast Guard's traditionally famous 36 ft motor life- boat became necessary. This paper describes the de- velopment of the new 44 ft steel self-righting life- boat. It begins with a discussion of desired features, describes scale models and mock-up structures, and gives a description of the physical set-up and engin- eering and design characteristics of the new motor lifeboat. 1967 SAE Transactions 660466. 210 Ft Medium Endurance Cutters. William F. Tighe, Jr. United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard has recently put into service new 210 ft cutters designed for search and rescue work, law enforcement, oc√©anographie work, and possible future antisubmarine warfare. This paper outlines the structure and capabilities of the vessel. An important feature of the cutter is its helicopter handling facilities, which have greatly increased the cutter's search and rescue capability by extending the area it can cover. The cutter is the first in Coast Guard service to be powered by a combination diesel engine and gas turbine installation. The combina- tion gives a top speed of 18 knots and a cruising range of 5000 miles. 660467. Lightweight Diesels in Lightweight Die- sel Applications in the U.S. Coast Guard. E. L. Parker, and R. W. Witter, United States Coast Guard. This paper describes the need and potential for lightweight diesel powerplants for marine usage and discusses briefly the Coast Guard's effort in this area. The diesel engine provides reduced fire haz- ard and low operating costs, but contemporary die- sels cannot deliver the power requirements neces- sary for high speed operations. The Coast Guard's test program of special turbocharged engines is des- cribed, as is the development of a prototype engine of low specific weight. 660468. Agricultural Tire Compounding. George D. Bartels, Goodrich/B.F./Co. One of the basic principles in tire compounding, is to base all compounds on 100 parts (by weight) of rub- ber hydrocarbon, and relate the addition of all other compounding ingredients to this base of 100-RHC. Regarding tread compounds for agricultural tires, 122</page><page sequence="64">major requirements of a rear tractor tire tread are that it have resistance to abrasion (wear), cleat-tear- ing, and weathering. 660469. Selection of Steel and Heat Treatment for Tractor Gears. G. W. Pakala, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works, Deere &amp; Co. This paper discusses steels and heat treatments that have and are being used in John Deere tractors. Some of the development test work is described which led to a given selection in three specific cases. Stress levels and other tractor gear design factors are mentioned. 660470. Caterpillar's Inertia Weld Process. T. L. Oberle, C. D. Loyd, and M. R. Calton, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new friction process, Caterpillar Inertia Welding, is described in this paper. The two distinguishing characteristics of this form of welding are a contin- uously decreasing rotational velocity and a continu- ously changing torque at the weld interface. This en- ables the forging of many previously "difficult-to- weld" materials, such as superalloys. Such welds also exhibit excellent fatigue properties. Because this process produces high strength bonds in dissi- milar materials, the designer is able to create com- posite parts using the special properties of each ma- terial in response to the needs of the design. 1967 SAE Transactions 660471. (SP-283) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Fundamentals of Valve Design and Material Selection. W. S. Giles, TRW, Inc., Valve Div. This paper reviews some of the fundamentals of valve train engineering as practiced by the engine designer. Valve proportions are considered in terms of engine volumetric efficiency, valve operating tem- perature, and stress conditions. Other factors influ- encing valve durability, such as valve train dyna- mics, cylinder head and seat design, and material selection, are also discussed. Common types of valve failures and their causes are appraised as a means of improving engine design. 1967 SAE Transactions 660472. (SP-283) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Considerations in Crankshaft Design. Frank Klieblan, Wis- consin Univ. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduc- tion to the analytical background that must be con- sidered for successful crankshaft design. Techniques for calculating various forces imposed on crank- shafts, as well as the formulas used in the calcula- tions, are fully covered. 660469-660536 660473. (SP-283) Engineering Know-How in En- gine Design - What Can the Turbochar- ger Do for the Engine. Wolfgang Lang, Garrett Corp. The turbocharged engine, by operating at intake and discharge conditions several times higher than atmospheric pressure, is capable of increasing its specific output to several times that of its naturally aspirated version, and at better fuel economy. Suc- cessful integration of the turbocharger requires rec- ognition of the interrelation and interaction of both reciprocating and turbo machines and changes in their performance characteristics. This paper dis- cusses the relation of intake manifold pressure to engine load and speed as a function of turbocharger performance, and methods of improving perform- ance of the engine at part speed without excessive overboosting at rated speed. 660474. (SP-283) Engineering Know-How in En- gine Design - Piston Design - Art or Science? James W. Winship, Bohn Alumi- num and Brass Co. A review of factors affecting an engine piston design and its successful operation reveal the thin line exist- ing between Art and Science. Piston language and basic terms are discussed and illustrated for engin- eers with limited knowledge of engine pistons. A review of fundamentals is outlined for engineers who daily face increased demands for higher speeds and output from engines that are ever decreasing in size. 660475. (SP-283) Engineering Know-How in En- gine Design - How to Design Bushings and Thrust Bearings for Engine Appli- cations. Laddie J. Pesek, Clevite Corp., Cleveland Graphite Bronze Div. The apparent simplicity of bearing bushings may mislead a designer into neglecting the essential de- sign requirements for its proper functioning. The design, as well as the machining operations that make the bushing a finished product, affects its effi- cient performance. This paper discusses materials, design pitfalls, causes of failure, and proper operat- ing conditions for both bushings and thrust washers. 660536. Seat Belts versus Shoulder Harness. J. L. Fulton, Los Angeles Police Dept. This paper compares the performance of seat belts and shoulder harnesses in high-performance vehic- les used in hazardous traffic assignments by the Los Angeles Police Department. Results are positive in favor of the harness, and support the predictions of effectiveness reported in the many research and test projects concerned with restraining devices. Also 123</page><page sequence="65">660539-660544 discussed are the steps taken in the design and field testing of vehicle occupant "packaging." A basic question is raised: Can or will the harness replace the seat belt in the near future? 660539. Safety Factor in Automotive Design. Louis C. Lundstrom, General Motors Corp. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, now under development by Congress, pro- vides for the establishment of motor vehicle safety standards. In anticipation of the development of new standards, engineers in the Society of Automo- tive Engineers and in industry are planning ahead, collecting additional safety test information and an- alyzing designs and data. Computers are playing an increasingly important role in this work. The results of such work will assist the safety engineer in deter- mining the true value of proposed safety standards and whether the proposed changes in vehicle design will actually result in an improvement in safety for the passenger. All components and assemblies are being studied intensively to determine what and how improvements and refinements can be designed into the product. Many of these are associated with the control of the vehicle: braking systems, tires, steering, controllability, and performance. These are accident prevention features. Still others are as- sociated with driver aids: visibility features, head lamps, tail lamps, mirrors, and vehicle control standardization; again for accident prevention. The remaining areas of work involve the accident situa- tion itself; the first and second collisions. The pur- pose of this paper is to discuss some of the factors involved in the first and second collisions. However, it is not possible to offer conclusions because the work is still incomplete. 1967 SAE Transactions 660540. MS Sequence Tests Today. C. C. Colyer, American Oil Co. Laboratory engine tests known as the MS Sequences were introduced in 1958 to give the automotive and the oil industries a common basis for predicting the field performance of motor oils. Since then, the se- quences have been revised periodically to reflect such changes in field conditions as the increase in short-trip driving, the extended oil-drain intervals, and the introduction of positive crankcase ventila- tion devices. Comparisons of laboratory with field data show that the sequences are generally success- ful in predicting motor-oil performance. Sequences IIA IIIA, adopted in 1965, give better repeatability, reproducibility, and field-test correlations than the original sequences I, II, III. The proposed Sequence VB, which uses an engine equipped with a positive crankcase ventilation valve, is now being evaluated. The reliability of the antiwear evaluation in the se- quences is questionable and indicates a need for further revisions in the test technique. Since 1958, the military qualification tests have been revised to include many of the motor-oil performance para- meters evaluated by the MS Sequences. However, different policies regarding test engines have thwarted any movement to consolidate the two series of tests. Discussion: M. W. Savage, Chevron Research Co. 1967 SAE Transactions 660541. Some Effects of Crankcase Lubricant Viscosity on Engine Operation. Richard L. Courtney, Chevrolet Motor Div., G.M.C. Stricter control of crankcase-oil viscosity specifica- tions at both low and high temperatures is needed to assure optimum engine starting performance, operating economy, and durability. The degree of improvement made by petroleum refiners in low- temperature cranking and starting characteristics of a number of major brand crankcase lubricants is shown by a comparison of 1966 and 1962 test data. High-temperature viscosity also is important because of its effects on oil economy, hydraulic valve lifter collapse, and hot-engine starting. 660542. Some Factors Affecting Starting of Cars at - 10 F. R. M. Stewart, and W. A. P. Meyer, Gulf Res. and Dev. Co. The effects of oil viscosity, fuel vapor pressure and, to a much lesser extent battery capacity, automatic choke setting, and starting procedure on the start- ing ability of four cars equipped with small engines were investigated at- 10 F. Oil viscosity and fuel vapor pressure were shown to be major factors in low temperature starting. A "start but not run" phe- nomenon was experienced in all cars. 660543. Multifunctional Gasoline Additives Re- duce Engine Deposits. Peter A. Asseff, Lubrizol Corp. A new series of multifunctional gasoline additives has been developed with the objective of improving overall engine cleanliness in addition to performing the normal functions associated with these additives. Both dynamometer and field test data are presented to show the improvement in engine cleanliness de- rived from the use of such products. These include information on overall sludge deposits, valve tulip deposits, and positive crankcase ventilation func- tion. 660544. Effects of Atmospheric Variables on Passenger Car Octane Number Re- quirements. J. C. Ingamells, and R. K. Stone, Chevron Res. Co.; N. H. Gerber, and G. H. Unzelman Ethyl Corp. Octane number requirement studies were made with 124</page><page sequence="66">eight late-model passenger cars to evaluate effects of temperature, humidity, and altitude. Primary ref- erence fuels and 1965 CRC full-boiling reference fuels were used. Temperature and humidity tests were made on a chassis dynamometer at sea level, while effect of barometric pressure was studied on the road at altitudes up to 6000 ft. Regression analy- sis was used to study the correlation between changes in octane number requirements and changes in temperature and humidity. These correlations were linear and varied among the cars. The average changes in ONR were somewhat smaller, but in fair agreement with those reported in the literature. The altitude effect also varied among cars tested and was generally nonlinear. On the average, the effect of barometric pressure from sea level to 3000 ft was smaller than concluded from earlier studies; from 3000-6000 ft, the pressure effect was larger. Discussion: C. J. DiPerna, Mobil Oil Corp. 1967 SAE Transactions 660545. Do Exhaust Controls Really Work? Eric P. Grant, California Motor Vehicle Pollu- tion Control Bd. Based on emission tests of 404 vehicles in public use, the average emissions of the 800,000 1966-model cars and light trucks are within the California stan- dards of 275 parts per million hydrocarbons and 1.5 per cent carbon monoxide. Emission levels in public use are higher than in proving ground testing. This means that the 1966-model cars are approximately 70 percent lower in exhaust emissions than the exist- ing car population. There is a very wide range of emissions (at least five to one) between individual cars, even with new exhaust control systems. Avail- able data indicate that there may be emission deter- ioration as mileage accumulates with the exhaust control systems in public use. There have been prob- lems with the exhaust control systems in the field. The introduction of a new system on over 800,000 vehicles the first year was a very large program com- pared to introductions of other new systems on cars. 660546. Laboratory Simulation of Driving Con- ditions in the Los Angeles Area. G. C. Hass, California Public Health Dept.; M. P. Sweeney, California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Bd.; and J. N. Pattison, Truesdail Labs., Inc. A study of driving conditions in the central Los An- geles area has led to the formulation of a new chassis dynamometer test cycle for exhaust emissions test- ing. A single vehicle was used to develop a street route representing a variety of morning peak hour commute trips. A cycle was then compared against the street route with seven vehicles of varying size 660545-660549 to assess cycle validity in terms of mode pattern and exhaust emissions. 660547. Control of Crankcase Emissions Through the Use of Negative Crankcase Pressure. R. W. Mcjones, and J. W. Hur- on, Aurora Plastics Corp., K and B Mfg. Div. This unusual approach to crankcase ventilation and emission control utilizes negative crankcase pressure as an aid in matching intake manifold pumping capa- city to engine blowby and crankcase ventilation re- quirements. The resulting system offers complete control of crankcase emissions, requires a minimum of attention, and has never been known to become inoperative because of control valve plugging. The system can be adjusted to match the blowby of en- gines of all sizes and all stages of wear. Valuable side effects include improvements in engine and oil cleanliness, reduction of oil leakage and internal oil consumption, and reduction of exhaust pollu- tants emission. 660548. Reduction of Diesel Smoke in Cali- fornia. Miles L. Brubacher, California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Bd. The California legislature, engine manufacturers, fleet operators, and enforcement agencies have pur- sued an active program of diesel smoke reduction since 1939. This program has resulted in creditably low smoke levels. While diesels do not contribute substantially to total community air pollution prob- lems, the public complains about the bad appearance of diesel smoke. There are many fruitful approaches for fleet operators to reduce diesel smoke, including more strict maintenance, fuel additive, driver indoc- trination, and engine derating. Fleets in the Los Angeles area have achieved excellent smoke reduc- tion by these methods and, at the same time, main- tain clean, first-class economical operations. Two of these fleets are analyzed in this report. 660549. Diesel Exhaust - A European V iewpoint. B. W. Millington and C. C. J. French, Ri- cardo and Co. Engrs./1927/Ltd. The impact of the Californian regulations on Europe, and their applicability to European conditions, is considered with particular reference to the diesel engine. In Europe photochemical smog is scarcely a problem; the toxic effect of carbon monoxide is the greater hazard. The emission by diesel engines of this and other toxic gases is low, but the exhaust smoke emission may be objectionable. Theories of smoke formation in combustion are considered, and methods of smoke measurement are described, in- cluding their shortcomings. The present position 125</page><page sequence="67">660550-660578 of European anti-smoke legislation is outlined, and characteristics of the diesel engine controlling smoke emission are examined. Finally, the perform- ance of antismoke fuel additives, which may allow uprating of 10-15 percent, and the problems asso- ciated with their use, are described. Discussion: C. G. A.

The automotive diesel engine is used more than any other type of engine for transporting freight over highways. Two kinds of pollution to be considered with regard to the diesel engine are the dark exhaust smoke and odor, of which the public is quite cogni- zant, and the less obvious but possibly toxic carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocar- bons, and trace compounds of other toxic materials. This paper discusses sampling, measurement tech- niques, and established standards for exhaust smoke and odor. Examination of diesel exhaust shows it to be less offensive in terms of harmful effects than the invisible exhaust from other types of engines. Major problem is exhaust color and odor. Discussion: J.

The nomenclature and fundamental theory for servo- mechanism analysis are covered in this paper. In- cluded are the mathematics, block diagram repre- sentations, analysis of steady-state and transient re- sponse, and analysis of stability. Sufficient details are given to permit the reader to understand basic works in the field. 660575. Stability Analysis of a Tractor Three- Point Hitch Control System. R. Bruce Hopkins, Deere and Co., John Deere Waterloo Tractor Wks. Stability is an important consideration in the opera- tion of a three-point hitch control system. The equa- tions are developed and stability evaluated by the Nyquist criterion for an actual system. The general solution for transfer functions is eliminated; instead, the equations that describe the system are written in matrix form. Digital computer solutions of the matrix written in complex numbers provide data points for the Nyquist diagram. 1967 SAE Transactions 660576. Introduction to Hover Dynamics. Julian Wolkovitch, Systems Technology, Inc. This paper presents a technique for assessing the in- fluence of configuration geometry, size, and mass on the dynamics of hovering vehicles. First, the equa- tions of motion for small perturbations from hover are discussed and certain derivatives removed or simplified from consideration of symmetry. The re- maining derivatives are then related to configuration geometry, size, and mass by simple momentum theory. The accuracy of this theory is examined by comparing test results on ducted fan and free pro- peller configurations. The rather limited experi- mental data agree with the momentum theory for ducted fan configurations, provided flow separations are not important. The effects of mass and size are separated from the effects of geometry by introduc- ing a nondimensional system of stability derivatives. It is shown how these nondimensional derivatives can be used to predict the effects of changing the mass or size of a configuration of given geometry. 1967 SAE Transactions 660577. Narrow Row Crops and Its Implication on Farm Equipment Design. W. H. Shannon, and C. E. Carlson, Allis-Chal- mers Mfg. Co. There is a trend toward growing row crops in nar- rower row spacings that affects the design of harvest- ing equipment; in particular, combines used for har- vesting corn. As the row becomes narrower, the headers are made larger to harvest a greater number of rows with each pass through the field. Larger headers can influence balance, hydraulic system, wheel tread, tire size, and power requirements of machine. 660578. Narrow-Row Crops and Tractor Design. K. W. Anderson, Deere and Co. The adoption of narrow-row spacings for corn and soy-beans will have only a modest impact on trac- tor design and usage. 1. Tire sizes currently available are adequate. 2. A minimum wheel tread of 60 in. and a maximum of 120 in. meets all requirements. This can be met by use of extra long axles and offset wheel hubs. 3. The turning radius is increased with wide-spaced duals, but this is not a problem. 4. The increased number of planter openers has little effect on horsepower requirements at least for the larger size tractors. 5. Annual hours of use of the tractor will be reduced because of further elimination of cultivation, and the 126</page><page sequence="68">substitution of self-propelled combines for tractor- operated corn pickers, but will be at least partially offset by increases in farm size. 660579. Evolution of Drive Systems for Work Tool Machines. G. W. Eger, and R. R. Laughlin, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The work tool machines that are discussed are those that have been used to shape the face of the earth and can broadly be described as earthmoving ma- chines. The paper then traces the evolution of drive systems for track-type tractors, motor graders, and loaders (track and wheel), with particular emphasis placed on matching drive systems to the vehicle so that the final result is a useful work tool machine that can be used efficiently in its intended work cycle. Finally, a survey is made of the various drive systems offered by industry today, together with predictions of future drive systems. 660580. Drive Systems Development for Off- Highway Transport. John H. Hyler, Le- Tourneau-Westinghouse Co. High performance power trains used in current off- highway rubber tired haulage equipment are impor- tant to the increased work capability of these ma- chines. Successive innovations and refinements ac- complished during the past 50 years to reach the present state of development are reviewed. Advan- tages obtained during this evolution are noted, and some evaluation is made of contemporary drive means. From this background of achievement, at- tention is focused on opportunities for further ad- vancements in power trains for such wheeled trans- port vehicles. 1967 SAE Transactions 660581. Some Views on the Human Engineering of Off-Highway Tractors and Self-Pro- pelled Machines. John B. Liljedahl, Pur- due Univ. Many improvements have been made during the past five years in the design of the human work space on off-highway vehicles. Some of the possible effects of the severe environment encountered on tractors are pointed out in this paper. This article em- phasizes that engineers who design the controls and human work space on off-highway vehicles should work as a team with medical doctors and industrial psychologists. Some explanations are given as to why the human work space on tractors has not re- ceived an adequate share of engineering design effort. 660583. Roll Guards for Tractors. Merlin Han- sen, Deere and Co., John Deere Waterloo Tractor Wks. 660579-660586 A study was made by Deere and Company tractor engineers to determine what happens to an operator if his tractor is upset. They found that actual vehicle upsets are the only satisfactory tests to find out what happens to operators with or without protective de- vices. Their experiments revealed the following: 1. A conventional tractor without any special roll- over protection will roll more than 90 deg in the event of either an accidental rearward or sidewise upset. An upset of 180 deg or more will invariably crush operator. 2. A roll guard of conventional design will usually limit the vehicle upset to 90 deg in which case the operator is seldom crushed to death even though he may be bruised. In a 180 deg upset, a properly de- signed roll guard must be strong enough to support the vehicle to protect the operator from being crushed. 3. A seat belt in conjunction with a roll guard can give the operator added protection in the event of an accidental vehicle upset, and thereby further re- duce the probability of his being injured or perhaps killed. 660584. 50 Years of Agricultural Tractor Devel- opment. Wayne H. Worthington, Consult- ing Engr. The story of Power Farming is a story of free enter- prise, perseverance and endurance of the individual, of vision, idealism and cooperation among men, of the lightening of human toil and the release of mil- lions of workers from farms to feed the ever hungry industrial revolution. By no means least, it is the story of producing food necessary to win two global wars, keep our allies alive and millions of the de- feated enemy from starvation. 660585. New Design Concept in Cylindrical Rol- ler Bearings. Hudson B. Scheifele, Fed- eral-Mogul Corp., Bower Roller Bearings Div. Recent research activity has led to a new design con- cept in cylindrical roller bearings, obtainable by a judicious choice of roller parameters best suited to the results of our experimental testing. Optimizing of the internal bearing geometry and race wall pro- portions has provided an increased load rating in an annulus smaller than the present standard boundary. This smaller boundary has allowed a multiple bore size availability in the present standard boundary, producing an extensive application coverage with a minimum number of basic bearing sizes. 660586. Simple Transmission for a Deluxe Estate Tractor. D. W. Moyer, Interna- tional Harvester Co. A deluxe estate tractor is made possible by the in- 127</page><page sequence="69">660587-660592 stallation of a simple hydrostatic drive coupled with precise transmission controls. Simplicity in design provides a compact, high performance and service- able transmission. A single control lever places full control of the vehicle at the operator's finger tips. Ground speed and direction may be varied without varying the engine speed, thereby providing inde- pendent auxiliary power at the power take-offs. Safety controls make it possible for unskilled opera- tors to operate the tractor easily and efficiently. 660587. Human Factors in Earthmover Devel- opment. Bernard J. McGuire, Jr., Cater- pillar Tractor Co. A brief history of the human factors field is given. Methods of obtaining design information in such basic human factors areas as operator size, ride, and control are discussed. The psychological aspects of the interaction between the operator and the earth- moving during testing are discussed. The effects of level of motivation, learning, and transfer of training on operator performance are described using labora- tory test results. 660588. Design, Manufacture, and Marketing of Cabs for Industrial and Agricultural Equipment. C. Lyle Harbeck, and J. P. Gardner, Allen Indust. Prod., Inc. This paper reviews what has happened in the cab industry since earliest developments and defines the "state-of-the-art" at the present time, pointing out areas of design, engineering, and marketing that should be investigated. Some of the new develop- ments in cab design, such as pressurization for dust elimination, air conditioning, and noise abatement are discussed. 660589. Future Trends in Earthmoving. E. T. Selig, Illinois Inst, of Technology, Res. Inst. The mechanics of soils is of fundamental importance in earthmoving and other soil manipulation opera- tions. Future design of machinery for these purposes will make increasing use of this technical discipline. The first step which is to subdivide the soil-machine system into components based upon the phenomena involved is illustrated. The role of soil mechanics is shown and the important areas of study needed to develop design procedures are discussed. Finally, several topics expected to receive increased atten- tion in the future are considered. The overall objec- tive of the paper is to show the importance of using soil mechanics in machine design and to encourage the further development of the interdisciplinary approach to problems dealing with soil-machine systems. 660590. New John Deere Industrial Loader- Backhoe Units. H. D. Sexton, Deere and Co., John Deere Dubuque Tractor Wks.; and J. A. Anderson, Deere and Co., John Deere Indust. Equip. Wks. The features, specifications and some of the major design requirements for the new John. Deere Indus- trial Loader-Backhoe units are presented. Some of the features of these units are: Adequate-capacity, well protected fuel tank in a low temperature loca- tion; high-capacity front axle and mounting structure; high torque, variable speed, economical gasoline and diesel engines; hydraulically actuated, wet clutch power reverser; wide speed selection, quiet transmission; planetary final drives; rear axle capa- city designed for imposed loads; a single, closed- center, variable flow, constant pressure hydraulic system; equipment power unit balance for optimum performance of each model; provision of tractor roll guard; wide range of backhoe and loader buckets; tractor protection provided by the loader frame; hy- draulic lines protected where possible; multiple function control levers; valves tailored to each par- ticular function; and adaptation for a wide range of uses. 660591. New Industrial Tractors. H. L. Geiger, and M. C. Christensen, Ford Motor Co., Tractor Div. Early in 1963, broad objectives for a new group of Ford industrial tractors were established. They were to meet the needs of contractor and construction customers for larger, more durable equipment than can be installed on farm -type tractors. The new tractors are derived from two current Ford agricultural models which are equipped with either diesel or gasoline engines. A discussion of the 4500 model tractor presents the engineering devel- opment principles applicable to all four models. The concept for this tractor was to power a front end loader and a rear mounted backhoe. Further, this equipment was to be the largest practical unit for the basic engine and drive train structures available from current production. System and component descriptions follow for the integral tractor loader backhoe. 660592. Applying Piston-Type Hydrostatic Drives. Gary Stein, Dynex Co. The increased use of piston type hydrostatic drives on vehicles creates a greater need for understanding their application requirements. The hydraulic cir- cuitry must be arranged to accommodate: braking, wheel spin out, differential speeds, and overhauling loads. Equal consideration must be given to the fluid type, filtration, temperature control, and reservoir 128</page><page sequence="70">configuration. A thorough discussion of fluids and fluid cleanliness is included in this paper, and possi- ble pitfalls which could damage hydrostatic drives, are called to the attention of the reader. 660593. Important Properties of Hydrostatic Transmission Fluids. M. J. DenHerder, American Oil Co. The properties a user should look for in hydrostatic transmission oils depend on the design of the trans- mission and the environment in which it is expected to operate. Important properties are: an ti wear, oxi- dation stability, antirust, demulsibility, cavitation and air entrainment, bulk modulus (compressibility), seal conditioning, viscosity and viscosity index. 1967 SAE Transactions 660594. Rough Terrain Fork Lifts and Their Application. F. W. Noller, and J. L. Pap- pin, Massey-Ferguson, Inc. The usefulness of fork vehicles in material handling is becoming increasingly apparent. The market has expanded from the initial use of the indoor industrial fork lift to include the outdoor industrial and the rough terrain fork lifts, the potential of the latter being of special interest to building contractors, lumber industries, and storage yards. Specifically, the rough terrain MF 2500 fork lift, departing from the tractor attachment concept to become a unit in itself, comprises many of the serviceable and cost- wise advantages of other Massey-Ferguson produc- tion tractors. 660595. Unique Transmission Concept for Stand-Up Type Fork Lift Trucks. Gor- don J. Kuivanen, and Stanley K. Smith, White Motor Corp., Indust. Div. A power shifted transmission for a stand-up series, material handling, fork lift truck is described in this paper. Compactness was a stringent design require- ment. The design approach followed utilizes a trans- verse engine mounting to conserve an overall length. Transmission control system is discussed, including method of getting desired inching control character- istics. 660596. Allis-Chalmers Model H4-HD4 Crawler Tractors. William R. Bryant, Allis-Chal- mers Mfg. Co. The concept and design approach to the Allis-Chal- mers H4-HD4 crawler tractor led to a general pur- pose machine capable of being used with attach- ments such as a one yd loader, dozer, scarifier, and logging equipment. The general arrangement is dif- ferent due to a midmounted radiator and some repo- sitioning of operator controls. Many items, includ- 660593-660600 ing a torque converter drive and a power shift Shuttle Clutch, were evaluated in regard to function, com- fort, and convenience. 660597. Noise Level Standards and Vibration Problems on Small Engines. Sherman C. Heth, Jacobson Mfg. Co. This paper discusses the standards activities which have taken place in the area of noise levels. Com- ments on vibration problems are discussed, and a brief outline of some noise sources and certain noise combinations of engines and driven elements are included. 660598. Control of Farm Tractor Intake and Ex- haust Noise. Douglas W. Rowley, Donald- son Co., Inc. The noise properties of the agricultural farm tractor are discussed. The major noise sources are identi- fied, along with a review of why, how, and to what degree these sources should be controlled. Because of this similarity, the information is also applicable to construction machinery equipment. The control of intake and exhaust noise is dealt with from an overall tractor noise standpoint - tractor noise being more than just exhaust noise. The conventional air cleaner is treated as a silencing device. Experimental data and analytical methods are presented to substantiate that one must be concerned with the entire exhaust or induction system - not just the muffler or air cleaner - to get the optimum benefit from the materials and space used while re- taining maximum engine and vehicle performance.

Dynamic testing yields more realistic values for the spring rates of rubber mounts used in vibration iso- lation systems. Shore durometer 20 percent load de- flection, tensile modulus, and other static tests have generally shown little relation to the actual spring behavior under field conditions. 1967 SAE Transactions 660600. The 645 - A Real Swinger. E. R. Hodg- man, Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., Constr. Machy. Div. This paper opens with an historical sketch on front end shovel loaders. It then deals with the evolution of the Allis-Chalmers front end shovel loader, model 645, and with the test program involved in its devel- opment. There is discussion on the selection be- tween the articulated and rigid frame, development 129</page><page sequence="71">660601-660605 and testing of the power train components, place- ment of the articulated joint midway in the wheel base for tracking on front and rear wheels, the self- contained rear power module with the operator lo- cated on this module, and constant rate steering. 660601. 988 Articulated Loader. James M. Reis- el, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Customer and market surveys indicated a need for a larger rubber-tired loader than that which was cur- rently available. They also showed that a dozer was required of the same tractor size which would per- form tasks between the heavy bulldozing done by the tracked bulldozer and light grading done by the motor grader. Discussed are the features required of the 988, 5V2 cu yd articulated loader and the 824B articulated bulldozer, the similarities between both machines, and the loader design considerations and the components used. Loader prototypes were built and tested at Caterpillar Proving Grounds and in the field to determine vehicle performance and relia- bility. 660602. Half-Century of Diesel Progress. C. G. A. Rosen, List-Rosen-Wittek Associates, Inc. This paper traces the historical progress of diesel powerplants over the past half-century. Many ideas prevailing today are based on early stages of diesel development. The theory expounded by Dr. Diesel in 1894 encompassed ignition by high compression. Use of this new powerplant concept was envisioned for locomotives, engines for large and small power on land, and marine engines. Obviously, this philo- sophy has been fulfilled to a marked degree over the years. Early problems involving a dearth of knowl- edge on fuel spray characteristics and uncontrolled cylinder head temperatures are mentioned. Devel- opment of injection systems, characteristics of differ- ent types of fuels, use of additives and detergents in fuels, bearings, piston requirements, and the influ- ence of turbulence on combustion are some topics reviewed. With advanced technical knowledge, me- tallurgical improvements, and modern manufactur- ing techniques diesel engines have met the demand for an economical, low cost high output power source. 660603. Future Trends in Energy Conversion Systems. Harvey W. Welsh, SAE Ad- vanced Powerplants Committee. This paper discusses present and future trends in utilization of energy sources as well as development of various types of powerplant systems. Types of energy, their limitations, cost, operations, and re- quirements related to conversion systems are re- viewed. Some of the sources mentioned are solar energy, nuclear and isotopes, thermal storage, and chemical energy. Present day energy converters analyzed are thermomechanical conversion systems such as the Otto, Diesel, and Brayton cycles. Also considered as engines of the future are direct con- version systems such as the storage battery, thermo- electric, and fuel cell systems. The author concludes that no one type system will predominate over all others; rather there will be continued effort to match the power converter to the overall system require- ments in the most effective manner. 1967 SAE Transactions 660604. Detroit Diesel Series 149 Engines. V. C. Reddy, H. S. Ford, Jr., and C. S. Hoffman, Detroit Diesel Eng. Div., G.M.C. The ruggedness, durability and performance achieved in the 149 design, complemented by the unusual ease of serviceability for an engine of this size, will be invaluable in obtaining minimum oper- ating costs and maximum equipment availability. Thus they appear ideally suited to railroad auxiliary power, marine, generator sets, total energy and a wide variety of industrial and construction applica- tions. It should also be recognized that these new engines for the 500 to 1300 hp class have been very conservatively designed in all important areas, allow- ing room for substantially increased outputs in the future. 660605. Economic Assessment of Turbine Pow- ered Industrial Vehicles. Glenn W. Kahle, and H. M. Hung, Deere and Co. Mathematical simulation is an effective method of evaluating the potential of new powerplants. Results from the mathematical model described in this paper agree quite closely with published data. It is invalid to compare engines only on the basis of fuel con- sumption. Other factors that must be considered are initial cost, engine life and maintenance cost. The turbine engine is a profitable vehicular powerplant if certain conditions of initial cost, fuel consumption and engine life can be met. Industrial scrapers would profit by an increase in the power to capacity ratio from the current value of 16 hp/yd3 to approximately 20 hp/yd.3 This would provide maximum productivity at minimum costs. The ability of the infinitely variable hydrostatic transmission to keep the engine at the minimum fuel consumption point does not provide an overall econ- omic advantage. Although the engine is maintained at its maximum efficiency for a given power level, the total performance of the vehicle suffers due to the reduced efficiency of the transmission. 1967 SAE Transactions 130</page><page sequence="72">660606. Chemical Energy Deburring as Applied to Hydraulic Components. J. E. Kern, Mo-Cr Coating Corp. The removal of burrs from functional metallic com- ponents by chemistry is showing practical applica- tion although very new in concept. These formulas are stable and predictable for dissolving carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and copper base alloys without d-c power. The process offers simplicity, usually without racking, in handling virtually every size and design of delicate parts to obtain smooth and pure internal and external surfaces. Improved func- tion because of reduced friction and more pleasing appearances are additional features. 660607. Closed Center Systems - 1966. Robert E. Kay, Vickers, Inc. A typical open-center and three closed-center hy- draulic systems (constant pressure, feathered pump and load-sensitive systems) are compared. No one is found to have advantages in every category (pump life, valve metering capacity, power loss and hard- ware cost). Selection of an optimum system for a par- ticular vehicle requires careful analysis of vehicle functions and duty cycles. The closed-center load- sensitive system does, however, offer advantages in all categories of comparison except price. While this system is not yet available and there are problems yet to be solved, it does offer a significant and pro- mising design advancement in closed-center hy- draulic systems for mobile equipment. 660608. Applied Power Hydraulics to a Skooper. Charles L. Fleming, Koehring Co. This paper discusses in detail the Skooper, an exca- vating machine developed by the Koehring Co. The discussion includes the application of hydraulics, straight line crowd, swing, simultaneous operation, standstill loading, and so forth. Loading oil shale, coal, gravel, and foundry sand (above and under- ground) are some of the tasks performed by the Skooper. 660609. 5/8 Yard and 1 Yard All Hydraulic Hoes. Richard O. Gordon, Harnischfeger Corp. The Harnischfeger Hydraulic Hoe circuits are de- signed for fast digging cycles, fast swing, separate control of each track in propel. The circuits have sep- arate pump sections, control valves, cylinders and motors. There is complete independence of action of all circuits in volume and pressure. The maximum horsepower that can be applied to any circuit is determined by the maximum volume of the pump section and the relief setting. The forces that are ap- plied to the structure are controlled by the area of the 660606-660613 cylinders, the fixed volume of the motors and the re- lief settings. The machine can fill the dipper at full digging depth, hoist to spoil pile height, swing 90 deg, dump the load and return to full depth in 17 to 22 sec. An experienced operator can average 3 cpm. The H312 5/8 yd machine can dig 2 cu yd per min. 660610. Materials and Metallurgy Related to Taconite Mining Abrasion. K. R. Jud- kins, Reserve Mining Co. Taconite is a term applied to low grade iron, bearing deposits comprising some of the most abrasive mate- rial known to man. Large scale mining of taconite at its onset presented immense problems related to the wear of digging and haulage equipment. New con- cepts of design and alloy steel application were re- quired to provide adequate serviceability of equip- ment parts exposed to this severe abrasion. Two cast materials, martensitic, high strength alloys hav- ing high impact properties, and 12-14 percent aus- tenitic manganese steel and its variations, have pro- vided the major developments for the actual wear parts such as dipper teeth, adapters, and shovel buckets. High strength structural steels, both cast and wrought grades, have been used extensively in the design of larger and more efficient mining equip- ment. Greater use of alloy steels in all phases of de- sign is anticipated on new equipment destined for the taconite mining industry. 660611. Use of Abrasion Resisting Alloys and Design Factors in Producing Under- ground Mine Scrapers. J. A. Wilson, Fah- ralloy Canada Ltd. The history of the development of designs and ma- terials for underground mine scrapers is presented and discussed. Present types of scrapers and consid- erations in their design and wearing characteristics are described, along with the alloy steels used in their construction. Comparative data on wear tests and wear rates in a number of large mining opera- tions are given. 660613. Development of a Hydropneumatic Suspension System for an Earthmoving Machine. Paul E. Gies, Houdaille Indus- tries, Inc., Buffalo Hydraulics Div. The Universal Engineer Tractor (UET), an earth- moving machine, can work as a bulldozer, scraper, rough grader, prime mover, dump truck, cargo car- rier, or personnel carrier. Versatility is made possible through the use of a hydropneumatic suspension. Because random variables of terrain and soil are tra- versed at speeds up to 30 mph, components in the suspension have been subjected to extremely high pressures and to heavy loadings of structural compo- 131</page><page sequence="73">660614-660640 nents, due to mechanical feedback. This paper re- ports on the nature of these problems, describes modifications made to overcome the difficulties, and gives results of subsequent field and laboratory tests. 660614. Systems Approach - Hydraulic Power for Articulated Vehicles. Thomas J. Ma- lott, and Robert C. Westveer, New York Air Brake Co. A new concept in construction equipment hydraulic systems has been developed that couples the im- plement and steering circuits in such a manner that constant steering horsepower is available throughout the engine speed range with no sacrifice in imple- ment performance. This paper discusses the overall power requirements for articulated loaders and how this new system improves the overall efficiency. 660615. Present Status and Future Trends of Materials in the Tractor Industry. E. S. Rowland, Timken Roller Bearing Co. Changes in engineering practices, in materials test- ing, and in techniques, as well as availability of new materials have influenced tangible advances in the tractor industry, according to this paper. The solu- tion of production and technical problems, due in part to expanded investigation and adaptation of de- velopments in other fields, has resulted in superior equipment with greater reliability at lower cost. 660616. V-Belts: Laboratory Evaluations versus Drive Performance. W. H. Buhrmann, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. In order to accomplish the many belt functions re- quired, V-belt product design engineers use many materials, construction variations, and production processes. The user, therefore, in order to obtain the best belt for the drive must secure a product evalua- tion. This paper describes the phases of laboratory evaluation, testing of experimental models, and field testing. 660617. Shovels and Haulers- Tools for Coarse Materials. John H. Lucas, Kaiser Cement and Gypsum Corp. The limestone mining operations at two large ce- ment plants are described, showing the different conditions encountered while using 45 ton trucks and 6 cu yd shovels. The physical setup of each loca- tion is described, as are the trucks, shovels, and haul roads associated with each operation. 660634. Recent Advances in Forging Beryllium for Aerospace Applications. Edward J. Kosi≈Ñski, and Arthur F. Hayes, Ladish Co. The deformation processing of beryllium with re- spect to mechanical properties, economics and manufacturing considerations is discussed. Produc- tion techniques using closed impression die forging, extrusion and ring rolling have been established for manufacture of wrought beryllium shapes, which include discs, hemispheres, cylinders, shafts and rings. The metallurgical aspects of the response of beryllium to themomechanical treatments are pre- sented. Current activity includes development of procedures for manufacture of large conical shapes with height-to-diameter ratios greater than one. 660638. New and Proposed Cryogenic Tempera- ture Resistant Plastics. James E. Kings- bury, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The need for cryogenic temperature resistant plas- tic materials in the space program is discussed. The selection of a plastic material for cryogenic applica- tion is dependent on the cryogenic fluid with which it will come in contact. Problem areas discussed are insulation of cryogenic materials, adhesives used on plastics, use of seals and gaskets, and the expulsion of cryogenic propellant in a zero gravity environment. Though this type research appears to have a limited application in the aerospace industry, future genera- tions may benefit materially from the work being done. 660640. Whisker and Short Fiber Reinforce- ments. L. Steg, General Elee. Co., Missile and Space Div. Discontinuous fiber reinforced materials appear, at the present time, to be both in need of some basic better understanding as a material for optimization purposes and need to be available in pilot plant quantities for design evaluation. This was approxi- mately the state of affairs in continuous fibers about three years ago. Technical prospects are excellent. Early applications may be in conjunction with glass-reinforced plastics as a secondary fiber to in- crease the overall composite modulus and to improve the interlaminar shear strength of filament-wound composites, in boron reinforced plastics to improve inter-laminar shear strength, in dental applications (filling reinforcements and dentures) and in rein- forced metallic electrical contacts and bearings. Major applications in the future may include rein- forced metal for high temperature applications, lead- ing edges, wing and tail sections of supersonic air- craft, landing struts, jet and turbine engines (vents, cowls, rotating rings, buckets and blades, etc.) struc- tural and electrical cables, pressure vessels, deep submergence structures, and components in nuclear systems. Other applications may be based on their magnetic and electrical properties, as well as high temperature insulation. 132</page><page sequence="74">The greatest need, however, does not lie in the technology at the structures and materials level but in the education of the designer and systems engin- eer in the realization that materials - within reason - will no longer be the limiting constraint. 660642. New and Proposed Composites. R. Spain, Air Force Materials Lab. The general history of the use of high-performance plastic reinforced composites is traced. An example of the projected economic impact of weight savings possible through the use of composites for a commer- cial aircraft, and the elements and their current sta- tus of reinforced plastic composites research are presented. Projections of composite research in the next 3-5 years predict, in comparison to current air- craft aluminum alloys, an increase in specific strength by a factor of about 5, an increase in specific modulus by a factor of about 3, and 300-500 F in- crease in thermal capability. Projection for the 5-10 year period emphasizes that increased strength is the area of greatest potential. 660643. Reinforced Plastics - What They Can Do for You in the Next Ten Years. D. V. Rosato, Plastics World and Reinforced Plastics. Seven billion pounds of resins, reinforcing agents, and fillers are estimated to be in annual use today in reinforced plastics, or composite, applications. Their total value to industry is about 4 billion dollars. Data are presented on the potential which exists for pro- ducing significant advances of at least two-fold, as opposed to relatively minor improvements in sheet materials such as steel, aluminum, and titanium. This paper presents a review of this surprisingly super market for reinforced plastics with emphasis on management participation. 660644. Hot Forming of Sheet Titanium Alloy. W. H. Edwards and R. C. Dickason, Lock- heed-California Co. Development of integrally heated draw dies and in- sulated die cases with a capability for accepting in- terchangeable die inserts greatly reduced problems of producing severely formed sheet titanium alloy airframe parts. Parts which were previously made in a multiple series of ambient temperature preforming operations, followed by hot sizing, are now produced in less time than formerly required for hot sizing alone. High scrappage rates formerly encountered were reduced to the point of being negligible. Al- though stainless steel draw dies are expensive, their cost is still less than the combined costs of pre- forming tools and matched hot sizing tooling. 660642-660647 660645. Precision Cast Hot Sizing Dies. Stewart Paterson, Jr., Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The precision casting of Nicrosil and HH alloy hot sizing dies designed for forming close tolerance ti- tanium alloy parts at high temperatures is described. A modified Shaw Process molding technique, with Nalcast crushed fused silica refractory grain is used to cast the dies to net dimensions. Foundry test re- sults show that a variety of part shapes can be suc- cessfully formed to net dimensions on the cast dies. The use of precision cast dies will also achieve sub- stantial savings by eliminating costly and time-con- suming machining. 1967 SAE Transactions 660646. Plasma Arc Welding for Large Titan- ium Aerospace Structures. G. J. Lang- ford, General Dynamics/Convair. Plasma arc welding produces butt-type joints satis- factorily in titanium as thick as 5/ 16 of an inch and in three common welding positions. The Keyholing technique accomplishes this in one pass. Without a filler wire addition this results in weld bead rein- forcement that has slight undercutting at the weld edges. Undercutting could be prevented by filler wire addition or corrected by a second 'wash' pass. Much higher depth-to-width weld bead ratios and much higher welding rates can be achieved by plasma instead of by conventional welding methods. Tooling for plasma arc welding requires a deeper underbead gap and wider holddown clearance than for conventional welding methods. Joint evaluation revealed excellent results. X-ray quality was defect- free ("water-clear"). Joint strength approximated 100 per cent for mill-annealed material. Joint ductil- ity was also high relative to parent material. This was established by Elongation and by Bend Radii determinations relative to parent material. Plasma arc welding may be an optimum choice between con- ventional TIG/MIG and Electron Beam methods for some large structures involving thick joints. 1967 SAE Transactions 660647. Experimental Titanium Crossbeam. Charles Quirolo, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. The design and fabrication of an experimental titan- ium crossbeam is described in this paper. The pur- pose of the program was to develop advanced manu- facturing technology applicable to the production of large titanium alloy structures. Specific areas of the full-size crossbeam design were established as test specimens and were fabricated early in the pro- gram to assure a usable manufacturing process. The designs, tools, equipment, and processes utilized in the fabrication process are discussed. 133</page><page sequence="75">660650-660656 The 8AI-M0-IV titanium alloy used to fabricate the modified full-size crossbeams is weldable and is capable of production utilization to provide advanced structural development hardware. 660650. Titanium Fabrication Techniques for the XB-70 and Beyond. Wayne A. Reinsch, North Amer. Aviation Inc., Los Angeles Div. A variety of titanium alloy product forms have been used for XB-70 applications, based upon a broad background of fabrication and service experience with the X-15 and the F-100. The ability to fabricate parts with complex contours and precision tolerances has been well-established for a wide range of pro- cesses including forming metal removal, welding, and heat-treating. The high reliability of the titanium mill products being produced, coupled with the re- producibility of the fabrication processes, has re- sulted in a very low scrap rate, making the fabrica- tion costs of titanium parts very competitive with the fabrication costs for steel or aluminum alloy parts. The service record of titanium alloy parts has been excellent, and is a testimonial to designers considering new applications. New developments such as trailing-cup welding, diffusion bonding, and metal matrix composites will further broaden the versatility of titanium, and extend its use to many new vehicles and products in the future. 660651. Recent Improvements in Titanium Mill Products. William H. Heil, Titanium Me- tals Corp. of America. Emphasis on a new line of titanium mill products has been generated by programs such as S ST and C5A. Also affecting these new products is the em- phasis on fracture toughness and salt water tough- ness. These new products include close tolerance continuously rolled alloy sheet, large plate, and long extrusions. 660652. Comparison of Lightweight Structural Materials: Be, and Alloys of Be, Mg, Al and Ti. Raymond W. Fenn, Jr., and Don- ald D. Crooks, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.; Roy W. Brodie, Lockheed Air- craft Corp.; and Stanley Chino wsky, Beryllium Corp. New mechanical property data on the 62 percent Be, 38 percent Al alloy, "Lockalloy," are presented and compared with other lightweight structural metals. The new data consist of tentative design properties for annealed sheet and provide a summary of its characteristics and properties. Material compari- sons are made on the basis of gross fracture stress, an elastic weight index for compression critical struc- tures, and on the basis of tensile strength/density and tensile yield strength/density ratios as a func- tion of temperature for tension critical structures. 660653. Recent Developments in External Coat- ings for Spacecraft. Carl P. Boebol, Air Force Materials Lab.; and Stephen J. Babjak, General Elee. Co. Newer concepts of thermal control coatings involv- ing tailored optical properties are compared with the paints and coatings presently used on spacecraft. Emphasis is also given to evaluation and measure- ment techniques specifically dealing with the com- bined spatial environmental effects facility. Into a facility of this type both exposure and intermittent "in situ" optical measurements can be performed under an ultrahigh vacuum. A brief discussion of damage mechanisms is included along with a des- cription of a computerized data retrieval system based on optical properties. Researchers in this aero- space field have high hopes for significant advances in the next several years through advanced materials and composites, "in situ" evaluation and measure- ment techniques, and computerized optical data re- trieval for thermal control designers. 1967 SAE Transactions 660654. New Ablative Heat Shield Materials for Mars Landers. Eric L. Strauss, Martin Co. Two new ablative materials, designated SLA-741 and SLA-561, have been developed by Martin for Mars Lander thermal, protection. The density range of these ablators is 0.18-0.22 g/cc and is substantially lower than that of other types of low density charring ablators. Plasma arc testing conducted in a simulated Mars atmosphere has established that SLA ablators are considerably more efficient than conventional ablators such as filled silicone, low density nylon- phenolic, or corkboard and that they form sturdy, ero- sion resistant chars. /967 SAE Transactions 660656. New High Strength Magnesium Casting Alloys for Aerospace Applications. P. A. Fisher, P. C. Meredith, and P. E. Thomas, Magnesium Elektron Ltd. A series of new magnesium base casting alloys has been developed for high stress aerospace applica- tions. The alloys are readily castable, have high strength, good ductility, and excellent fatigue prop- erties. They show little or no tendency to micropor- osity and provide distinct advantages in control of quality. The alloys are based on the application of a new principle of heat treatment involving internal precipitation of hydride. Described in detail are ZE63A and ZE63B alloys. 1967 SAE Transactions 134</page><page sequence="76">660657. Physical and Environmental Effects on the Energy Dissipating Characteristics of Balsa Wood. A. C. Knoell, Jet Propul- sion Lab., Calif. Inst, of Technology. This paper presents the results of a developmental program designed to determine physical and envir- onmental effects on the response of balsa wood as an energy dissipator. Specifically, the effects of mois- ture content, density, temperature, and pressure on the energy dissipating characteristics of balsa wood are presented. It is shown that the response of balsa wood is critically dependent on physical and envir- onmental conditions, and that the energy dissipating capacity of the material increases significantly under certain combinations of these conditions. 1967 SAE Transactions 660658. Selection of Materials for High L/D Reentry Vehicles. L. Yates, Lockheed- California Co. Considerations governing the selection of superal- loys and refractory alloys for the fabrication of high- performance reentry vehicles are discussed. Oxida- tion resistant coatings were evaluated to determine their capacity to protect faying surfaces. The per- formance of the R-512A coating under simulated re- entry conditions is reported. 660659. 4000 F Oxidation Resistant Thermal Protection Materials. Jerome J. Kroch- mal, Air Force Materials Lab. Coated refractory metals, coated and alloyed graph- ites, hafnium-tantalum alloys, refractory borides, and stabilized zirconias are considered for the 3600-4000 F high-velocity air environment. Only refractory borides and stabilized zirconias are indicated as of- fering long duration and reuse capabilities for such high-temperature utilization. Iridium, as coatings on substrates of either graphites or refractory metals, appears attractive for shorter times (less than 1 hr). Environmental evaluation and the need for a theoret- ical framework to enable the prediction of perform- ance data for such materials are indicated to be ma- jor problems facing users and suppliers. 660660. Practical Protective Coatings for Re- fractory Metal Reentry Vehicle Compo- nents. Seymour Priceman, and Lawrence Sama, Sylvania Elee. Products, Inc. A recently developed high temperature oxidation protective coating system for columbium and tanta- lum alloys is described and characterized. Oxidation test data and mechanical property data are given which indicate the suitability of these coatings as thermal protective materials for use in multi-cycle earth re-entry vehicles. The inherent capability of 660657-660663 this coating to be uniformly applied to practically any size or shape part, or even to intricate sheet metal assemblies, is demonstrated. Several types of coated components are illustrated as examples of the adaptability of the process to complex full scale aerospace hardware. 1967 SAE Transactions 660661. Hydraulic Fluids for High Altitude- High Temperature Vehicles. R. E. Hat- ton, Monsanto Co. Some aerospace and high-performance vehicles now in operation and many of those now being designed have hydraulic system operational requirements which far exceed the capabilities of conventional hy- draulic fluids. In response to such requirements, hydraulic fluid researchers and producers have de- veloped many new types of fluids. These fluids differ greatly in properties and in performance capabilities, compared to each other or to conventional fluids. This paper describes in general terms of proper- ties and composition certain aspects of many of the classes of fluids now being suggested as high tem- perature, high performance hydraulic fluids and sug- gests methods for selecting hydraulic fluids for speci- fic applications. 660662. High-Temperature Electrical Materials. P. E. Kueser, Westinghouse Elee. Corp., Aerospace Elec'l Div. High-temperature electrical materials presently available for application in the 500-1600 F range have been evaluated for advanced Rankine cycle sys- tems and other high temperature applications. Mag- netic materials for high saturation, low loss use in- clude cobalt-iron and doubly oriented silicon-iron alloys. Niveo alloy (72w/o Co, 23w/o Ni and other alloying elements) has the highest creep resistance above 1000 F of all magnetic materials suitable for mechanically stressed applications. Inorganic insu- lations for magnet wire, flexible sheet, interlaminar coatings, potting compounds, and rigid or molded parts are discussed. Inconel-clad silver and clad and unclad dispersion strengthened copper electrical conductors offer the best performance in unstressed applications respectively. 1967 SAE Transactions 660663. Materials for Aerospace Antennas and Radomes. Godfrey F. Buranich, Cornell Aero. Lab., Inc. This paper presents information compiled on the temperatures encountered by reentry and high per- formance aircraft, the metals and dielectrics useful for antennas and radome applications, and the effects of high temperature on the performance of these as- semblies. 135</page><page sequence="77">660664-660670 660664. Evaluation of Proposed Hydraulic Fluids for the SST. C. W. Galloway, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The results of pump loop testing 50 candidate super- sonic transport (SST) hydraulic fluids were pre- sented to the May 1965 SAE Aerospace Fluid Power Systems and Equipment Conference in Los Angeles. This paper presents the results of subsequent pump loop testing of nine new fluids or compoundings. A discussion of simulated fire-resistance testing is also included. Results of pump loop testing to date indi- cate that four specific types of fluids are considered the best SST hydraulic fluid contenders. They are: chlorosilicone, mineral oil, perfluoroalkyl, and poly- aryl. 660665. Materials for High Altitude - High Tem- perature Vehicles Candidate Structural Materials and their Properties. Milton S. Roush, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona. This paper discusses those materials that appear to offer the most promise for structural usage in high altitude/high temperature vehicles. Various alumi- num-, titanium-, beryllium-, iron-, and nickel-ba≈õe alloys are compared with respect to density, short time tensile, creep, fatigue, and fracture toughness properties. Their corrosion and stress corrosion char- acteristics as well as longtime stability are discussed. 660666. Beryllium Structures for Aircraft. F. E. Barnett, Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab.; J. M. Finn, and L. C. Koch, McDonnell Aircraft Corp. The advantages of an F-4C beryllium rudder are pre- sented (torsional stiffness increased 500 percent, weight reduced 46 percent). Its analysis, design, fab- rication, and ground tests discussed, and a fail-safe flight test program defined. Other potential F4C ber- yllium structural components within the state-of-the- art are reviewed and potential weight savings esti- mated. 660667. Some Structural Considerations in the Design of the CH-47A Chinook Helicop- ter. F. H. Immen, Boeing Co., Vertol Div. The U.S. Army CH-47A Chinook is a transport heli- copter developed by Boeing. Major considerations in the development of its structural integrity are dis- cussed in this paper. Included is a description of fatigue analysis techniques which were developed to insure safe life of its critical components. This technique includes a mission profile, component fatigue strengths, use of top-of-scatter flight loads data, use of Miner's rule of cumulative damage, and evaluation of possible anomalies on fatigue strengths and flight loads. 660668. V/STOL Aircraft Structural Considera- tions. Victor W. Alvey, and Harry Fried, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. The requirements for V/STOL aircraft introduce unique structural problems and make more severe those common to conventional vehicles. Propulsion modes requiring increased thrust during hover and their relative airframe locations are responsible for the major portion of the associated problems. Those problems which require first-order attention, such as design philosophy for fan-in-wing configurations to obtain optimum structural design are discussed. The solution of acoustic environment problems, such as noise attenuation and acoustic fatigue, are inves- tigated. Likewise, the study of thermal problems, both internal and external, and their effect on struc- ture is presented. The problem of debris damage due to the propulsion environment at ground hover is discussed showing the potential energy level of de- bris. Finally, the importance of structural weight/ cost effectiveness is shown for V/STOL aircraft. 660669. Large Cargo Airplane Structural Con- siderations. W. T. Shuler, Lockheed- Georgia Co. This discussion summarizes the highlights of the C-141A airplane program, emphasizing fatigue, dam- age tolerance, and static strength considerations philosophically and in considerable detail where de- sign criteria are involved. Dynamic considerations are also included insofar as the structural design of the airplane was affected thereby. Finally, some sig- nificant differences in criteria requirements between the C-141A and the C-5A are identified together with their expected impact on structural design. 660670. Effects of Low Level Turbulence on the Structure of a Large Logistic Aircraft. William H. Austin, Jr., Air Force Systems Command. Atmospheric turbulence measured at low altitudes over rough terrain in high wind conditions is shown to be more severe than the turbulence previously measured in thunderstorms. The military require- ment for large bomber and logistic airplanes to oper- ate at low level thus will result in large weight and performance penalties unless some means to reduce structural loads is employed. By use of power spec- tral density techniques, it is shown that loads in low level turbulence can be reduced on large air- planes with an adequate stability augmentation sys- tem. This load reduction is sufficient to insure that large aircraft operating at low level will not be un- duly penalized in performance. 1967 SAE Transactions 136</page><page sequence="78">660671 . Effects of Subsonic, Supersonic, Hyper- sonic and Orbital Environments on Structures. Owen B. McBee, McDonnell Aircraft Corp. Preliminary selection of basic materials for flight vehicles is based on Mach number-altitude orienta- tion, which includes turbulent flow to laminar flow location and effects. Structural weights and materials as a function of temperature are presented for both protected and unprotected primary structures. De- sign considerations and material selections for other pertinent items such as inlets, nose cones, leading edges, and transparencies are also considered. 660672. Manned Spacecraft Structure versus Unmanned Spacecraft Structure. Gor- don N. Davison, Boeing Co., Space Div. The large difference between the total numbers of manned and unmanned spacecraft and their respec- tive missions is discussed. The environmental and functional requirements having different effects on the two spacecraft types are described. The materials characteristics involved in those requirements and the resulting typical configurations are reviewed. It is concluded that vibration and pressurized gas con- tainment have the outstanding influence on space- craft structural systems. It is noted that new struc- tural factors of safety have not been derived on the basis of any rational consideration of the design con- ditions for stability or pressure critical structure. 1967 SAE Transactions 660673. Space Vehicle Structures - Does Man's Presence Make Any Difference? Mar- shall E. Alper, Jet Propulsion Lab., Calif. Inst, of Technology. Mariner IV and the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) are compared to explore the question "Does man's presence make any difference in space vehicle struc- tures?" The environment, mission requirements, and subsystem interfaces are examined to determine the extent to which they affect the space vehicle struc- ture and to see which elements are influenced by the presence of man. The author concludes from the comparison that man is a unique payload for a space vehicle and, consequently, his presence strongly in- fluences the payload structure. The rest of the space vehicle structure is primarily influenced by size requirements and by mƒºssion duration. 660674. Changing Environment and Its Effect on Structures. C. E. Conn, Jr., North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The aerospace changing aerothermodynamic envi- ronment from subsonic to supersonic to hypersonic flight velocity has brought the cost environment to 660671-660676 the foreground. The increasing performance de- mands for light-weight structure and the resulting increase in airframe cost are discussed. The influ- ence of material and fabrication costs on the desired efficient structural concepts of a supersonic wing box cover are evaluated. The solid-state diffusion bond- ing process is presented as a potential fabrication solution to achieving the desired minimum weight structure at low airframe cost. 660675. Effects of Space Environment on Struc- tural Materials. John B. Singletary, and John B. Rittenhouse, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. The early estimations of spacecraft engineers con- cerning potential degradation of structural materials in the space environment have not been as extensive as was first believed. In general, the mechanical properties of bulk structural metals are very little affected by the space environment except, of course, for the probability of penetration by meteoroids. The fatigue life of flexed structural materials in simulated space vacuum has been studied and it has been shown by some investigators that fatigue life is de- creased. However, other studies have shown that the reverse is true. The very thin plastic film structures such as the balloon satellites could be more susceptible to dam- age by the space environment. The successful per- formance of the Echo I satellite, however, has indi- cated some resistance to the deleterious effects of the space orbital environment by these materials. The development of the polyvinylidene films has re- sulted in a material more resistant to vacuum ultra- violet degradation than the polyethylene terephtha- late previously used. However, the planning of pro- grams for longed lived satellites (of the order of one year in space), multimanned satellites, manned space stations, missions, manned and unmanned, to the moon and planets, and orbiting astronomical ob- servatories, have imposed more exacting demands upon the reliability of the properties of materials for aerospace applications. 660676. Bending Strength of a Large, Thin- Walled Pressure Stabilized Cylinder Be- yond the Onset of Compressive Skin Wrinkling. Robert P. Miller, and Theo- dore F. Gerus, Lewis Res. Center, NASA. The ultimate bending moment capability of a thin- walled pressure-stabilized cylinder with typical axial loads has been demonstrated to be at least 50 per cent greater than the bending moment at which com- pressive wrinkling first occurs. The test article used to demonstrate this experimentally consisted of a 120 in. Atlas booster tank, filled with water and pressur- 137</page><page sequence="79">660677-660683 ized to 24 psig. A method to predict the approximate ultimate bending moment is given. 1967 SAE Transactions 660677. Storable Propellant Pressure Vessels. R. J. Heymans, and E. D. Thompson, Mar- tin Co., Denver Div.; L. D. Berman, Mar- tin Co. Four considerations in the design of storable propel- lant structures are: stress caused by load and pres- sure requirements, sealing surfaces and bolted tank closures, corrosion and stress corrosion, and material compatibility. This paper discusses the developmen- tal background of these considerations in connection with the Titan family. Specific items discussed are design and fabrication of the basic tankage, espec- ially sealing problems, and the compatibility of ma- terials with amine fuels and nitrogen tetroxide. 660678. Hypersonic Thermal-Structural Con- cept Trends. P. P. Plank, Lockheed-Cali- fornia Co. Improvement in airframe structural efficiency through the utilization of unique and minimum weight concepts is a primary applied engineering objective for the hypersonic environment. The es- sential elements for hypersonic structures criteria are temperature environment, low road intensities, room temperature load conditions, structural stability, minimum gage material requirements, material pro- ducibility, reusability, nonoptimum factors, and ve- hicle configuration compatibility. A comparison of thermal structural concepts indicates that the hot load-carrying structure is the leading candidate for a typical M8 hypersonic cruise vehicle wing and fuselage application. 660679. Structural Considerations in the De- sign of a Liquid Hydrogen Tank for Hypersonic Vehicles. J. F. Fischer Jr., General Dynamics/Convair; and A. H. Hausrath, TRW, Inc. In order to utilize liquid hydrogen efficiently as a fuel for hypersonic cruise vehicles, it is necessary to design an optimum weight tank of high structural re- liability. The structural design analysis, and testing aspects of such a liquid hydrogen tank are discussed. The tank was required to occupy an elliptic space envelope and be allowed to buckle elastically under inertia loading and the effect of temperature grad- ients. The support system minimizes load deflection and thermal deformation interaction between tank and vehicle. The tank must meet burst pressures of 60 psi and yet be stable for certain loading conditions with negligible internal pressure. 1967 SAE Transactions 660680. Effect on Structures of Rapidly Chang- ing Environment - Launch to Orbit to Entry. Allen I. Bernstein, and Melvin A. Price, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The influence of the integrated, rapidly changing environmental conditions, from launch through orbit to entry and recovery, on the structure and thermal protection systems of advanced space vehicle sys- tems is defined. Two vehicle systems are consid- ered: a space exploration system employing a verti- cal takeoff expendable launch vehicle, ballistic en- try vehicle, and vertical landing; and an orbital op- erations system employing reusable stages with horizontal take-off and landing capability. Data are presented on the mission requirements, design cri- teria, structural characteristics, and pacing technol- ogy problems for each system. 660681. Safety Considerations in the Design of Manned Orbital and Space Vehicle Structures. R. C. Goran, and T. P. Brooks, McDonnell Aircraft Corp. The problem of achieving safety in orbital and space vehicle structures is essentially the problem of ob- taining a structural reliability of "one" in the en- gineering sense, not necessarily mathematical. This problem is not unique to space vehicle structures; manned aircraft also have this objective, and the "ba- sic √©l√©ments" that determine the structural safety of such vehicles are well established. A number of spe- cific structures on the Mercury and Gemini space- craft are reviewed to illustrate the considerations given to structural safety (including "fail safe" and "fracture tolerant" design) by the utilization and ex- tension of these "basic elements." 660682. Problems of Environmental Testing of Orbital and Space Vehicle Structures. Charles W. Rathke, and Otto Mayer, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Problems in environmental testing of orbiting and space vehicle structures are primarily caused by the limitations of the ground test facilities in providing adequate simulation of the operational environment. This paper will give an account of the specialized environmental simulation technique developed and the analysis methods used to supplement the facil- ity capabilities for the environmental test program of the Lunar Excursion Module. 660683. Pre-Stressed Jettisonable Structures for Advanced Upper Stages. David J. Peery, and S. H. Myhre, General Dyna- mics/Convair. An improvement to the thin walled tank in the higher load region is developed by the addition of a pre- stressed jettisonable shell. Capability of the tank in- 138</page><page sequence="80">eludes post-wrinkling strength in bending. Compari- son is made with an efficiently stiffened tank, using for example a liquid hydrogen tank 10 ft in diameter. The results of the study show the total effective weight of the minimum gage pressurized tank with a prestressed jettisonable insulating shell to be less than one-half the weight of an insulated stiffened tank for a wide range of loading. 1967 SAE Transactions 660684. Dynamic Characteristics of Titan III. George Morosow, Martin Co. Booster structure is subjected during the boost phase to a number of dynamic environments which may af- fect the integrity of the overall structure. To perform a meaningful dynamic load or stability analysis, an accurate prediction of the dynamic characteristic of the structure is required. Due to the complexity of Titan III, it was felt that the analysis by itself was not sufficient to guarantee a successful flight. A 20 per cent dynamically scaled model of the Titan III was constructed and a vibration survey conducted. Com- parison of the results indicates in general a good cor- relation of the test and the analytical data in the first three lowest pitch, yaw, and longitudinal modes. 660685. Problems Associated with Environ- mental Testing of Orbital and Space Ve- hicle Structures. Eugene P. Miller, Air Force Systems Command. Studies were performed to determine which envi- ronments are germane to simulation during struc- tural verification tests on future aerospace vehicles. Missions of proposed orbital and space vehicles and associated environmental conditions are defined. Effects of both natural and induced environments on structures are discussed and those necessary for sim- ulation are presented. Results conclude that critical environmental conditions are experienced during exit from and entry into the earth's atmosphere. For the most part, the effects of the space environment are relatively insignificant on vehicular structures. Present environmental structural testing capabilities for orbital and space vehicles are presented and fu- ture development needs predicted. 660686. Problems in Management of Aero- space Ground Equipment. C. J. Comp- ton, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The problems associated with the management of aerospace ground equipment can be solved by a pro- gram designed to ensure proper recognition by con- tractor and customer management. Such a program requires sweeping changes in the categories of ad- ministration, engineering, configuration manage- ment, contracts, and data. Implementation will en- 660684-660688 sure an adequate appreciation of Aerospace Ground Equipment (A.G.E.) requirements by management and furnish positive and effective guidance to the design engineer. Most important, the A.G.E. pro- gram will provide uniform equipment configuration, adequate contracts, and useable engineering data. 660687. Systems Approach to A.G.E. Manage- ment. Edward H. Newman and Samuel K. Stock, Air Force Space Systems Div. In the past Aerospace Ground Equipment (A.G.E.) management had an individual role in the develop- ment and acquisition of a weapons system. With the advent of the Air Force systems management tech- niques, in implementation of new DOD directives, management of A.G.E. is now part of the total sys- tems management package. Primarily this paper des- cribes the application of total systems management technique in the definition, design, development, and production of a weapon system. These new man- agement procedures provide the technical basis for the establishment of three baselines, namely, Pro- gram Requirements Baseline, and Product Configu- ration Baseline, as well as the development of speci- fications and control of engineering changes. The new DOD directives underscore the impor- tance of obtaining, as the output of Contract Defini- tion, achievable performance specifications, backed by a firm fixed-price or fully structured incentive contract. To achieve these objectives, AFSCM 375- 5 "Systems Engineering Management Procedures" provides a method for the basic technical information flow to identify total system requirements, including all A.G.E., the system specification, facilities, pro- cedural data and trade studies. Hardware and facil- ity configurations are identified and controlled and a uniform specification program conducted within the frame of reference of the aforementioned man- uals. This technical documentation provides a ready and accessible means of communications between the Air Force and its contractors, across the engin- eering and design organization of the contractors, between contractors, and across all technical dis- ciplines. 660688. Systems Approach to Space Support. K. F. McSweeney, and R. J. Manzo, Grum- man Aircraft Engrg. Corp. The successful completion of a space program de- pends not only upon excellence in mission planning and the design of the spacecraft, but also upon a cap- able and timely progressive logistics system. The key to accomplishing maximum effectiveness for this support program lies in proficient analysis of all the basic support requirements. In essence, the systems 139</page><page sequence="81">660689-660696 approach to space support is simply the: ‚Ä¢ Separation of the total program into phases. ‚Ä¢ Identification of requirements by phase. ‚Ä¢ Evaluation of approaches. ‚Ä¢ Trade-offs and analysis to select best approach. ‚Ä¢ Formulation of a Support Plan based on analysis. ‚Ä¢ Implementation of a Support Plan. The points which must be emphasized are that a logical requirements evaluation must be followed, and the decisions reached must be based on analysis and not "gut feel" or "seat of the pants" engineering. This will eliminate "Symptomatic Support Engin- eering," or solving each symptom as it arises - panic by panic, crisis by crisis. 1967 SAE Transactions 660689. Systems Approach to Facilities Manage- ment. Patrick H. McGuinness, Air Force Dept. In the author's view, present method of managing the acquisition of technical facilities in the tradition- al Air Force civil engineering manner is obsolete and is steadily proving more and more inadequate in the face of ever expanding technology. A system of management based on the techniques developed in system engineering and outlined in the Air Force Systems Command Manuals in the 375 Series is ad- vocated as a course of action for the future. 660690. Agena Experience Reflects Need for Flexibility. K. R. Dungan, Lockheed Mis- siles and Space Co. This paper will concern itself primarily with the ex- tensive advanced planning that was required to es- tablish the flexibility to be built into the facilities necessary to support the Agena vehicle during its development, testing and activation phases. 660691. Space Vehicle and Ground Systems Re- liability. James H. Rusk, Jr., General Dynamics/ Convair. Space mission reliability includes both space vehicle and ground support systems reliability as factors, and it is often charged that ground systems are treated as "poor cousins" in the allocation of reliability pro- gram effort. Factors which determine reliability re- quirements, the physical meaning of these require- ments, and the characteristic problems involved in meeting them are compared for space and ground systems. It is shown why the required reliability should be achieved on ground systems at a lower cost on space systems. 660692. Space Support Facilities Acquisition. D. F. Long, Parsons/Ralph M./Co. The acquisition of direct support facilities for Space and Weapon Systems has generated many problem areas during programs that required facilities design, prototype testing and construction concurrent with missile/launch vehicle research and development. This paper outlines some of these problems in the areas of facilities concepts, design, construction, operation, and maintenance; identifies the causes and indicates action taken to date by both govern- ment and industry to systemize the management of future Space and Weapon System development. The urgency and importance of the applicability of the elements of training and personnel, logistic support, technical data, and support equipment are also dis- cussed. 660694. Automation versus Manual Testing. R. W. Gray, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. Automation of high production, high complexity, and high speed testing is often of obvious worth. The use of automation by the "popular" space pro- grams has consideration of systems previously con- sidered to be incompatible with automatic testing, either because of testing difficulty or cost. Manual testing is still a requirement in the developmental testing phase of many programs. It is also an estab- lished requirement in many factory level tests. The complete systems approach involving the total mis- sion requirements for factory through launch (or other use) sequence will enable the logical selection of the correct testing elements, both automatic and manual. 660695. Necessary Influence of GSE on Space- craft Design. J. M. Miller, III, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. For efficient, flexible, and high-quality checkout, the capabilities and limitations of checkout equipment must be considered in the spacecraft design. Ideally, spacecraft and ground support equipment (GSE) should be designed as a working entity, with ground rules established for their concurrent development. Emphasis must be placed on systems engineering to establish and maintain compatibility. Some insight into the importance of GSE in meeting space objec- tives is presented together with an analysis of the degree to which spacecraft design is influenced by GSE. 660696. Event Monitoring with a Time-Shared Computer Controlled Checkout Sys- tem. Richard E. Martin, and Bernhard Blutinger, General Dynamics/ Convair. A method of monitoring the events that occur during testing of a space vehicle with a time shared com- puter controlled checkout system will be considered. The data compression method chosen is an attempt to optimize the analysis in an environment where 140</page><page sequence="82">the command and control functions have highest pri- ority. Other factors such as accuracy, speed, and cost will be discussed and compared to present methods of event monitoring. 660697. Design Considerations for Track Ve- hicle Transported Missile and Electron- ic Systems. J. J. MacRostie, FMC Corp. Some insights into problems associated with the de- sign and use of ground vehicles for tactical missile and electronic systems are presented. The problems of shock and vibration, operating deflections and range of payloads are treated briefly. Some guide- lines are provided in selection and design of ground vehicles, and descriptions are provided of some ve- hicles currently in use. 1967 SAE Transactions 660700. Systematic Approach to Determining Aircraft Aerospace Ground Equipment. D. J. Berrier, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. In order to efficiently maintain an operational air- craft in its intended environment, adequate and timely aerospace ground equipment (A.G.E.) must be made available for the first flight test phase of the aircraft development program. This demands that a systematic approach to de- fining A.G.E. be instigated early in the conceptual design phase and that a program considering the fol- lowing disciplines be established: intended aircraft mission and utilization, maintenance goals, and re- liability of the aircraft in terms of individual subsys- tems and their interface functions. These primary va- riables are combined to establish the basic require- ments for A.G.E. The detailed requirements for A.G.E. must be ob- tained through aircraft subsystem analysis designat- ing to what extent each subsystem requires support and then how this support is to be implemented. Once the A.G.E. requirements are established, a de- tailed evaluation of customer A.G.E. inventories and commercial A.G.E. sources must be performed to determine the applicability of existing A.G.E. The remaining support requirements must then be satis- fied by the design and development of new A.G.E. 660701. On Board Checkout Systems for Air- craft. G. F. Scheller, and M. J. Cronin, Lockheed-California Co. On-board test systems are reviewed from the initial establishment of a need through the technical and economic trades of implementation. The varying needs of different users are considered along with the assistance that can be effected in operations and maintenance activities. Systems within the state-of- 660697-660704 the-art are discussed along with idealized future possibilities. 660702. Ground Support for the Supersonic Transport. Earl E. Carlsten, Boeing Co., Supersonic Transport Div. The supersonic transport is a larger and more com- plex airplane than the present-day subsonic trans- port. Economic considerations, however, require that maintenance and servicing functions be re- duced in order to provide high airplane utilization. A support concept is described which combines ground support and self-sufficiency items built into the airplane. Systems and support equipment which are unique to the supersonic transport are described. 660703. Public Relations Aspects of Ground Support Equipment. Paul L. Williams, and H. K. Hanchett, Northrop Corp., Nor- air Div. The public relations aspects or customer acceptance of ground support equipment has become of signifi- cance in the total aircraft system. There are two readily discernable segments to the public relations aspects of ground support equipment: initial or pro- gram costs, and functional suitability. These closely interrelated segments can be broken down into more specific factors covering technical and nontechnical requirements and managerial control. Attempts to quantify or reduce the factors to a rank order for im- portance have been unsuccessful to date since the impact of each on good relations is heavily depend- ent on specific situations. Fourteen factors are iden- tified and discussions are presented, including ex- amples of how they have impacted on public rela- tions. 660704. Practical Design Approach to Semi- automatic Test Equipment. W. T. Beard, and B. B. Watson, General Dynamics/Fort Worth. In the past, testing of airborne electronics equipment has, for the most part, fallen into the category of either completely manual or fully automatic. While manual test equipment is relatively simple and in- expensive, it is too slow for testing many of today's multiple-output electronic packages. To reduce check-out time, more sophisticated automatic test systems have been built. However, the automated equipment requires elaborate programming and stor- age facilities, and the overall cost of this equipment tends to be astronomical. This paper presents an ex- amination of current maintenance problems in the Tactical Air Command and investigates problems as- sociated with some of the automatic test systems in use today. The merits of semiautomatic test equip- 141</page><page sequence="83">660705-660712 ment are discussed as a possible optimum solution to many of these problems. As an illustration, a de- sign problem is presented along with a practical ap- proach and solution. 1967 SAE Transactions 660705. Fixed Service Tower as a Means for Launch Vehicles Build-Up and Servic- ing. Charles S. Gumpel, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The Douglas Aircraft Co. has developed a concept known as the Fixed Service Tower (FST) to increase the efficiency of medium space vehicle buildup and servicing operations. Advantages of the concept are presented in this paper by first discussing present flight preparation procedures for the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration Improved Delta vehicle and then discussing how these procedures would be improved by utilizing the FST techniques. Aspects of the FST, which are covered in detail, in- clude location, configuration, flexibility, growth po- tential, launch environment, cost, and implementa- tion status. 660706. Facilities, Handling and Transporta- tion for the Titan III ITL System. Ar- thur E. Inman, Martin Co., Denver Div. The integrate-transfer-launch (ITL) concept of as- sembly, checkout, transport, and launch of the Titan III vehicle at Cape Kennedy requires a unique facil- ity and special handling and transportation equip- ment. The launch facility incorporates an entirely new concept for preparing a vehicle for launch. The handling and transportation equipment designed for use in the ITL system includes some that is common to the aerospace industry and some that is entirely new. This paper presents a description of the ITL facility and the ground handling and transportation equipment required to support the Titan III system. 1967 SAE Transactions 660707. Transportability of Space Systems Equipment. John R. Reynolds, Air Force Space Systems Div. The Air Force Space Systems Division's continued development of equipments for the space program is producing problems in engineering for transporta- bility that are even more challenging than those faced in the development of the missile family. The large solid rocket motor (SRM) program's experience in 120-156 in. solid motor transportation and hand- ling is outlined in this paper. The current state-of- the-art and the anticipated requirements for the future are discussed, as well as emphasizing the im- pact of transportability resolutions upon program management. The measures implemented in the Air Force Systems Command's 375 Series Manuals to integrate the Engineering for Transportability Pro- gram into the design engineering process are sum- marized. 660708. Fluid Power Support Equipment in Space Environments. Arthur B. Billet, Vickers, Inc. To keep pace with man's increased scope of space exploration in the future, it is imperative that fluid power system technology continues to expand its methods and techniques to be able to meet the se- vere environments indicated on the various planets. Support equipment industries have a prime new field to develop in the maintenance of vehicles in space. Various investigations have discovered basic data that will prove valuable in projecting effective fluid power support for spacecraft outside the Earth's atmosphere. 660710. Turbine Fuel Thermal Stability- From Refinery to Supersonic Transport. L. P. Haxby, A. L. Ludwig, and G. F. Law- ler, Shell Oil Co. Delivery of high quality fuels to commercial turbine engine aircraft may become more critical for super- sonic transport operation. This paper presents high temperature stability test results on current aviation turbine fuel samples taken from refineries and air- ports throughout the world. Transportation methods involve combinations of tanker, barge, multiproduct pipeline, and truck movements. Data show that, through the application of proper handling tech- niques, fuels can be transported from refinery to air- craft, through complex distribution systems, with no significant loss in thermal stability. Data also indi- cate that current aviation turbine fuels are well above the minimum thermal stability specification limits for present subsonic jet aircraft. 660711. Lubrication of the SST Engine. J. A. Daley, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft. The effect of the flight environment on the severity of the lubrication requirements of the Pratt &amp; Whit- ney candidate SST engine is reviewed and compared with current commercial turbofan engines. The char- acteristics of currently available lubricants are ex- amined. The design features of the SST engine aimed at reducing lubricant system stress are dis- cussed. The conclusion is drawn that several type II oils currently available will meet the requirements established by the Pratt &amp; Whitney SST engine. 660712. Lubricity of Jet Fuels. J. K. Appeldoorn, and W. G. Dukek, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. The poor performance of some high purity jet fuels 142</page><page sequence="84">appears to be related to polar compounds in the fuel and not to viscosity, volatility, or sulfur and nitro- gen compounds. Surface active additives such as corrosion inhibitors markedly improve lubricity. Results of laboratory tests correlate well with the field experience where sticking fuel controls and pump wear at high temperatures have been reported. Highly refined fuels developed to meet new stand- ards of thermal stability or purity are generally poor in lubricity compared with conventionally refined fuels and may require lubricity additive to satisfy advanced fuel systems. Discussion: Robert K. Johnston, Southwest Research In- stitute; Kenneth L. McHugh, Monsanto Co.; authors' closure 1967 SAE Transactions 660714. Fuel Related Problems in Engine Fuel Systems. B. E. Love, Lucas Gas Turbine Equip. Ltd.; K. A. Hatchett, and A. E. Peat, Rolls-Royce Ltd. This is a summary of fuel related problems encoun- tered with fuel systems particularly during the past five years. The combined efforts of systems engin- eers and fuel technologists to overcome them are stressed. Problems associated with chemical impuri- ties such as sulfur and chlorine compounds are dis- cussed and comments made upon the effects of par- ticulate matter and free water. Further problems as- sociated with lubricity of fuels are included and some reference to fuel additives. The effects of some hydrogen treated fuels on synthetic rubber is out- lined, also the development of equipment to oper- ate at high fuel temperatures and on a wide range of petroleum distillates. 1967 SAE Transactions 660715. User's Evaluation of Power Spectral Analysis Procedures. W. G. Spalthoff, Aerospace Corp. A new digital computer program has been developed for more efficient power spectral density analysis of vibration data. This program allows the analysis bandwith to be varied with frequency in an arbitrary manner and incorporates other economies in the processing of the data. A preliminary evaluation of this program was carried out to assess its benefits re- lating to the construction of vibration specifications. The results show considerable promise for obtain- ing acceptable power spectral density functions at substantially reduced cost. 66071 6. Errors in Analog Data Reduction Equip- ment. Ronald D. Kelly, Measurement Analysis Corp. An understanding of the errors associated with the measurement equipment is essential to making cor- 660714-660719 rect conclusions about the characteristic of the phys- ical process being measured. This paper discusses the errors associated with analog data reduction equipment. The specific items covered are ordinary and cross-spectral density analyzers; auto- and cross- correlation analyzers; and ordinary and joint prob- ability density analyzers. 1967 SAE Transactions 660717. LMSC Pyrotechnic Shock Experience. A. I. Ikola, and M. D. Wherry, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. The use of pyrotechnic devices in missiles and space vehicles creates a hazardous environment for equip- ment. Several reported flight anomalies concurrent with the separation event prompted Lockheed Mis- siles and Space Co. (LMSC) to devote considerable effort to establish methods of treating pyrotechnic shock. An extensive ground testing program in- cluded activation of the vehicle's pyrotechnic sys- tems and subsequent measurement of the shock. Several methods of improving confidence in equip- ment performance during pyrotechnic shock by means of electrical modifications, shock mount- ing, and testing were investigated. In addition to treatment of present shock problems, a program was initiated to reduce the pyrotechnic shock levels in the vehicle by redesigning the booster separation joint. Several methods of achieving a qualification testing system for equipment is included in the dis- cussion of the system and specification which LMSC presently uses. The present status of the shock prob- lem with future proposed LMSC effort is also dis- cussed. 660719. Application of Distributed System Con- cepts to Dynamic Analysis and Control of Bending Vibrations. C. C. Ward, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. As an alternative to the normal mode approach to the dynamics and controls analysis of flexible aero- space vehicles, the analysis of bending vibration is being studied in terms of the distributed system con- cepts of propagation and reflection. A relationship is developed between the vibration equation of motion and the propagating wave equation. Trans- mission matrices, including the effects of shear com- pliance and rotary inertia, are developed for uniform beam segments. Through a transformation tech- nique, the local state variables are changed to char- acteristic variables of the beam permitting factoriza- tion of the solution into propagation and end-effect matrices. The technique is applied to a cascaded or step beam structure and a beam structure combined with a damped spring mass sloshing model. The ad- vantages and disadvantages of the distributed para- 143</page><page sequence="85">660720-660725 meter matrix approach are investigated and the use of this approach for the dynamic analysis of aero- space vehicles is evaluated. 660720. Cumulative Fatigue Under Variable- Frequency Excitation. S. F. Masri, Cali- fornia Inst, of Technology. This paper presents the results of vibration fatigue tests under variable-frequency excitation, along with an extended theory of cumulative damage in fatigue. The application of this theory requires certain ex- perimentally determined parameters from constant- amplitude sinusoidal fatigue tests. Results of such supporting tests are reported. 1967 SAE Transactions 660721. Methods of Estimating Structural Re- sponse to Aeroaeoustic Loads. Pritchard H. White, Measurement Analysis Corp. The aeroaeoustic pressure loading due to jet and rocket engines and boundary layer turbulence is dis- cussed. The response of structures to these loadings is considered, and many methods of analysis are ex- amined. An evaluation of the labor involved and the resulting accuracy of each method is made. The study shows that the most complete and detailed analysis does not often give the most accurate re- sult, and that more approximate methods can give as comparably accurate estimates of response with far less investment of time and labor. 660722. Weapon System Effectiveness and De- fense Decisions - A View from the Of- fice of the Secretary of Defense. Archie L. Wood, Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense. The role of military worth in defense decisions is dis- cussed. Military worth is defined in terms of military utility, system effectiveness, military effectiveness and system cost. These concepts are defined and ex- amples are developed illustrating these definitions. Military effectiveness is defined to include both military utility and system effectiveness. Both these properties, since they are both influenced by uncer- tainties, should be made subjects of assurance acti- vities during the concept, definition, acquisition and operational phases of the life of a weapon system. 660723. Navy's System Performance Effective- ness Program. L. D. Whitelock, NMC System Performance Effectiveness Steer- ing Com.; and P. J. Giordano, Naval Ap- plied Science Lab. The . primary objective of the Navy's System Per- formance Effectiveness (SPE) program is to provide tools and techniques necessary for the application of the newly evolved systems effectiveness disci- pline to the acquisitive process for Naval equipment. This discipline attempts to relate design and its as- sociated resource penalties to mission accomplish- ment while requiring the employment of systems en- gineering techniques to system development. Exten- sive Navy efforts in the development of analytic tech- niques, system design concepts, and system support concepts are briefly described. Areas covered will in- clude microelectronics and packaging uniformity. Brief case histories will illustrate progress to date. 660724. Systems Effectiveness Throughout the Program Life Cycle. Donald H. Heaton, Air Force Systems Command. This paper discusses the future of systems effective- ness and cost effectiveness analysis in the sequen- tial phases of the life cycle of a weapon or support system. System and cost effectiveness analysis should be developed to be a useful aid to decision- making by all participants to a program. Models and supporting data must present total system effective- ness which will cover the operational period of the weapon and total cost analysis which will embrace the acquisition period as well. Also discussed is the application of cost effec- tiveness analysis by program phases such as during conceptual formulation, contract definition, and dur- ing the acquisition period of the weapon system. Cost effectiveness and system effectiveness analysis is an evaluation tool which is an aid to decision mak- ing by the government and contractor throughout the life cycle of a weapon or support system. 660725. Evaluation of Systems Effectiveness of Army Missile Systems. Robert O. Black, and Horace R. Lowers, Army Missile Command. This paper briefly describes systems effectiveness work currently under way at the Army Missile Com- mand. Two basic types of systems effectiveness anal- yses performed on Army missile systems are des- cribed together with their time phasing during the life cycle of the weapon. The Command conducts major operations research studies at the outset of each major development program and at points where significant changes in system characteristics occur. All system performance parameters are ana- lyzed in the context of a "mix" of weapons in a dyna- mic battlefield environment. Factors considered are mobility, survivability, kill probability, firepower, and so forth. Normally, these studies are used to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of proposed sys- tems and to conduct initial parametric design trade- off studies. The second type is that of mission reliability 144</page><page sequence="86">assessment. This assessment is conducted through- out the development, production, and deployment phases of the system life cycle and is designed to monitor those critical systems parameters (such as reliability, maintainability, and availability) which are subject to wide variations in terms of degree of achievement. The major emphasis in this paper is on describing the concept of mission reliability assess- ment and in discussing its application as a manage- ment tool at the Army Missile Command. 660726. Effectiveness Considerations in Apply- ing AFSCM 375-5 Requirements to Control and Surveillance Systems. George H. Allen, Richard M. Demilia, and Charles E. Gardella, Technical Re- quirements and Standards Office. This paper discusses general and specific require- ments of AFSCM 375-5 as applied to control and sur- veillance systems. The ingredients of the total de- sign concept to achieve operational effectiveness in- clude specifications, analyses, engineering reviews, and tests. The concepts of utility, acquisition time, effectiveness, and cost are discussed. Model and trade-off considerations are presented. Applications of WESIAC and AFSCM 375-5 principles and pro- cedures to three complex electronic systems are il- lustrated. 1967 SAE Transactions 660727. Role of the Modeler in Systems Effec- tiveness. Chester H. McCall, Jr., Booz, Allen Applied Res. Inc. This paper defines system effectiveness and identi- fies the framework within which such a program op- erates. The objectives of a system effectiveness pro- gram are covered, along with the tasks in the pro- gram. An example of the use of the model during sys- tem life is given. The role of the modeler is outlined, especially his responsibility for good communica- tions with the system effectiveness team. No de- tailed mathematical terminology is used. 660728. Systems Concept Effectiveness. A. L. Guess, Martin Co., Baltimore Div. Frequently, a choice between system concepts must be made on the basis of something other than a de- tailed evaluation of the design effectiveness of these systems. This paper develops a rudimentary analy- sis process for use in addressing this problem. 660729. System Effectiveness Assurance in Re- sponse to DOD/NASA Requirements. Leslie W. Ball, Boeing Co., Aerospace Div. Both the DOD and NASA have established manage- ment practices to assure that for each system the 660726-660731 mission success requirements are identified, com- municated and achieved. Industry contractors who serve these customers must prove that they have the ability to predict and control costs, schedules, and technical performance to achieve the potential cost effectiveness of the system. This paper deals with the technical segment of the cost assurance, sched- ule assurance, and technical assurance trilogy. It presents a logical system for identifying all activities that experience has shown are critical to achieving system effectiveness. It covers the major techniques for assuring that resources, in the form of docu- mented technology, facilities, and qualified people, are available for each critical activity. Finally, it summarizes program management techniques for assuring that these resources are applied to each pro- ject in accordance with cost effectiveness principles. 1967 SAE Transactions 660730. Maximum System Effectiveness or Worth for Specified Cost. D. R. Archi- bald, General Dynamics/Convair. The present emphasis is on product (system) effec- tiveness or overall performance and total costs of a product, including costs of development, ownership, and obsolescence. This concept of product value highlights the need to identify and clarify the inter- relationships of the acquisition, use, and mainte- nance elements to achieve product or system re- quirements within cost limits. The problem is to recognize and assess all the significant elements for trade-offs and to establish the interrelationships with the necessary clarity and visibility for decision making. A product effectiveness program with cost con- straints utilizes a basic approach: 1. Defining product purpose and use goals, and ap- plying fixed constraints, such as costs, schedules, and skills. 2. Development and utilization of a checklist to help assure inclusion of all product effectiveness factors, using experience and analysis data. 3. A management system using check points to monitor and incrementally verify programs toward the established goals, and to modify methods and technology through trade-offs to attain these goals. 4. Contracts or other customer/producer agreements designed to provide flexibility and responsiveness within prescribed boundaries for changes required to attain the product effectiveness requirements. 1967 SAE Transactions 660731. Administration Considerations in Sys- tem Effectiveness Programs. William H. Statler, Lockheed-California Co. The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss some of the principle administrative aspects encoun- 145</page><page sequence="87">660732-660736 tered in the management of systems effectiveness programs. The administrative aspects of the process which are discussed deal with the problem of achiev- ing credibility in the results, from the manager's point of view, by varying the constraints imposed on the study to provide a sensitivity analysis of the ef- fects of the constraints on the results, and witfnthe need for the identification of the point of diminish- ing returns in each investigation. An example analy- sis is diagrammed and the administrative task is shown to be that of providing the control, the guid- ance, and the environment of understanding among all the technical disciplines involved. Experience to date with the administration of systems effective- ness programs has shown that systems analysis must be an integrated design function, and that systems effectiveness activity cannot be conducted properly by an isolated group of analytical specialists. 660732. Aerodynamic Installation of High-By- pass Ratio Fan Engines. William M. Douglas, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The nacelle design for high-bypass ratio turbofan en- gines installed on high subsonic aircraft is treated in this paper. The high-bypass ratio turbofan, with its greater airflow per pound of thrust, presents differ- ent problems from those of existing turbojets and low bypass ratio turbofans. For example, there is some bypass ratio, depending upon aircraft payload range and engine geometry, above which the "short duct" has advantage. The determination of this bypass ra- tio for a typical case is presented. For a bypass ratio 8 turbofan, the short duct nacelle has 3-4 percent better airplane direct operating costs than the long duct. With the short duct established as the pre- ferred geometry for high-bypass ratio turbofans, the problems of the air inlet, inlet cowl, fan nozzle, fan afterbody, and gas generator afterbody are discussed. Also, the thrust reverser, which affects the nacelle geometry, has been considered. It has been shown that when the bypass ratio is greater than about 4, the gas generator reverser does not reduce landing distances enough to justify its weight and complica- tion. 660733. Aerodynamic Considerations for En- gine Inlet Design for Subsonic High- Bypass Fan Engines. W. S. Viali, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. Consideration is given the manner in which inlet throat Mach number, cowl forebody lip suction loss, boattail pressure, and skin friction affect the design of nacelles for high-bypass-ratio, short duct engines. The mutual relationship of the fan nozzle, hot gas nozzle, the gas generator cowling, and the fan cowl are discussed. 1967 SAE Transactions 660734. Aerodynamic Considerations for En- gine Exhaust Design for Subsonic High- Bypass Fan Engines. G. T. Frazier, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. Analytically and empirically derived external and internal aerodynamic data have been applied to the high-speed cruise development of a low-drag, mini- mum-thrust-loss, strut-mounted nacelle. The nacelle considered for this study houses a high-bypass-ratio subsonic fan engine with a short fan duct and a pri- mary plug nozzle. The analysis technique has been geared to a simple geometric description of the nacelle and exhaust system so that high-speed com- puters may be used to generate trade data. The trade data permit the selection of exhaust systems which, when combined with the complete nacelle, will pro- vide the highest thrust-minus-drag configuration consistent with the airplane cruise mission. 1967 SAE Transactions 660735. High -Bypass versus Lower Bypass En- gine Installation Optimization. J. T. Kutney, General Elee. Co. Installation considerations for high-bypass turbofan engines in the range of 5-10 are examined. An engine and installation concept for the high-bypass is des- cribed. Installation considerations discussed include the effects of nacelle shape, wing proximity, inlets, thrust reversers, and accessory location. It is pointed out that the high-bypass engine may offer the flexi- bility to design the ideal aerodynamic installation without compromise by installation requirements. 1967 SAE Transactions 660736. Thrust Reverser Effectiveness on High- Bypass Ratio Fan Powerplant Installa- tions. J. D. Thompson, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The use of high-bypass ratio engines for future trans- ports presents the opportunity to improve greatly the operational use of thrust reversers. By eliminat- ing the gas generator reverser, or by merely spoiling the thrust of the hot gas stream, the need for reduc- ing power due to hot exhaust ingestion can be alle- viated. Engines of the 8:1 bypass ratio class can achieve today's level of reverse thrust effectiveness by reversing only the fan stream. Engines of the 3:1 bypass ratio class require fan stream reversal plus spoiling of the gas generator exhaust. An analysis is presented indicating the desired effectiveness level for the individual fan and gas generator reversers. Design features and model test- ing of a particularly promising type of fan thrust re- verser are discussed in detail. Test results are pre- sented which provide information for the designer and which relate some features of fan thrust reverser geometry to performance. 1967 SAE Transactions 146</page><page sequence="88">660737. Installation Considerations for the High Bypass Fan Engine in Subsonic Trans- ports. D. W. R. Lawson, Rohr Corp. The areas of the high bypass fan engine installation that differ from current engine installations in sub- sonic jet transports are reviewed from the stand- points of configuration, environmental severity, structures, and systems. Potential design problem areas in developing the installation are discussed. It is concluded that the resulting installations, based on the engineering technology gained from the design and operation of the current jet transports, will de- monstrate an improvement on current equipment service capability. 660738. Development of Thrust Deflection and Vectoring- V/STOL. A. D. F. Smith, Rolls-Royce Ltd. The progress with the use of deflected thrust in Eu- ropean V/STOL airplanes is reviewed. The difficul- ties which arise in adopting this concept are exam- ined and commented upon in the light of the prac- tical experience which has been accumulated. Sev- eral configurations are discussed: the single sided deflector, a more complex rotating cascade version, the tilting pod-engine configuration, and the vec- toring nozzle. 660739. Designing the Mohole Logging Unit. Charles F. McGinty, Schlumberger Well Services. There are many unusual considerations to take into account in the design of a well logging winch unit. This particular unit has facilities for use in extra- ordinarily deep holes. One of the facilities required was a cable speed range of 175:1. This paper shows basic considerations necessary to design such a winching unit. This unit was designed for Project Mohole, a scientific effort administered by the Na- tional Science Foundation to explore and sample the layers of the earth's crust, and the underlying mantle. A giant sea going, floating platform will contain this unit, in addition to the other equipment needed to drill through and explore these layers. 660740. Jacobs Engine Brake, Application and Performance. Don D. Cummins, Jacobs Mfg. Co. The Jacobs engine brake, introduced early in 1961, has enjoyed a success unequaled by any retarding device marketed in this country. Although the en- gine brake is a new device, it simply harnesses the built-in braking ability which is as old as Dr. Diesel's first engine. The operation, design, and performance of this engine brake are discussed in this paper. As of this writing, approximately 30,000 units are in opera- tion in both on and off-highway applications. 660737-660743 660741. Combination Diesel Engine - Air Com- pressor- "The Dual Diesel." Robert C. Schmidt, Cummins Eng. Co., Inc. Until recently, dry cargo has been unloaded from trucks by use of compressed air. By making the auto- motive engine act partly as an air compressor during the unloading operation, the auxiliary air compressor mounted on the tractor farme can be eliminated. This paper, in describing the dual diesel, dis- cusses operating characteristics, cycle analysis, and operational problems. 660742. Coventry Climax Racing Engines - 1961-1965. Walter T. F. Hassan, Jaguar Cars Ltd. This paper discusses reasons for Coventry Climax's participation in motor racing and includes a history of events which led to the manufacture of the 1961- 1965 racing engines. Design philosophy is discussed; detailed design and development of the various en- gines is described, including the IV2 liter V-8 with three combinations of bore and stroke and with two and four valves per cylinder, together with the 2 liter version of the V-8, and the IV2 liter 16 cyl engine which was not developed in time to race. Notes on the special exhaust and inlet systems developed for these engines are included. Lucas petrol injection, and transistorized ignition systems are also des- cribed. The Appendix contains specifications of all the engines together with sectional arrangements, photographs and performance curves, and other in- formation in tabulated form. 1967 SAE Transactions 660743. High Altitude Laboratory Studies of Compression Ignition Engines. Dale E. Woomert, Army Coating and Chemical Lab. An engine is sensitive to its fuel and lubricant. This suggests such problems as wear and deposits, and the modifying conditions of environmental effects which cause cold starting and vapor lock. Another environmental condition not often considered is alti- tude. This paper discusses very briefly a test facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground that can be used to evaluate the full load performance of an engine at varying altitudes. Altitudes at 12,000 ft can be simu- lated with a 150 hp engine while maintaining tem- peratures from - 65F to +120 F. Results for six en- gines operated in this facility are presented. These are all military engines but must have commercial counterparts. Data show the advantage of turbocharged en- gines over naturally aspirated engines. However, unless turbocharger is properly matched to engine and environment, gains are negligible. Data on which the paper is based are all normal laboratory 147</page><page sequence="89">660744-660749 measurements (power, fuel flow, temperatures and pressures) and in some cases turbine speeds, air flow and combustion data. 660744. Some Considerations of the Effect of Atmospheric Conditions on the Per- formance of Automotive Diesel En- gines. R. A. C. Fosberry, and Z. Holu- becki, Motor Industry Res. Association. A decompression chamber for testing automotive diesel engines at simulated altitudes up to 12,000 ft is described. Results obtained on seven naturally aspirated and one turbocharged diesel engine are discussed in relation to the day-to-day correction of engine performance and to site rating of engines. Comparisons are made between experimental re- sults and existing correction methods, and modifica- tions or replacements of the latter are suggested. Re- sults are assessed in terms of the correction method proposed in SAE Standard J816. Attention is drawn to the different bases which may be used in correct- ing engine performance (for example, constant fuel delivery or constant exhaust smoke density) and the need to consider changes of exhaust smoke density or fuel consumption depending on the correction basis chosen.

Four vehicle concepts have been developed to tra- verse the twilight zone and increase mobility in marginal terrain. These vehicles have a low ground bearing pressure and shallow draft. They were de- signed to transport three men and their equipment, have a limited range and life expectancy, and be in- expensive. Each vehicle has frontal armor protection from small arms fire and is designed to be carried internally in the CH-47 helicopter. The four vehicle concepts have undergone a feasibility test over var- ious types of terrain and exhibited enough mobility to warrant modification and retesting to obtain addi- tional performance data on the various drive configu- rations. 660746. Successful Valve Train Rebuilding. Nor- man J. Musil, TRW, Inc. This paper shows that a mechanic must first deter- mine what caused the valve failure in order to take proper steps to prevent a recurrence. Emphasis is then placed on the necessity of precision workman- ship and methods of achieving it. While dealing in depth with the proper inspection and installation of valves, guides, and seats, it is pointed out that the condition of the various parts of the entire valve train is equally important to long valve life. Every- thing from the timing gears to the cylinder head, and their influence on valve life, is discussed. Discussion: Orlo J. Blomquist, White Motor Corp.; Hans W.

Toye, English Elee. Co., Ltd. The penetration of diesel fuel sprays in gas has been measured on a static rig over a range of conditions. The main finding was that penetration was affected by gas temperature more than predicted by some existing formulae. A new correlation has been de- rived to fit the data. Preliminary results from obser- vations on an engine indicate that the correlation applies under operating conditions. 660748. Some Observations on the Liquid In- jection Technique as a Research Tool. James T. Gray, Nelson T. Meckel, and R. J. Mannheimer, Southwest Res. Inst. The liquid injection technique (LIT) is a sample method for observing diesel spray behavior. Excel- lent visibility of the spray is attained by injecting the fuel into a clear hydrocarbon liquid instead of a pres- surized gas. Earlier research with the technique is reviewed, and questions are posed regarding the mechanism of spray visibility in the liquid and the comparability of penetration measurements in liquid and gas. Experimental results lead to the conclusion that visibility in the liquid is due to cavitation and penetrations in a liquid and a dense gas are gen- erally equivalent. Applications of the liquid injec- tion technique to diesel injection problems are brief- ly discussed from both a research and hardware ori- ented viewpoint. Discussion: P. H.

Kurt Melcher, Bosch/Robert/GmbH. The dynamometer evaluation of internal combustion engines has involved a great deal of tedious interpre- tation and presentation of results. In the past, engine test cells have not been fully utilized, and skilled test engineers have been occupied with routine work, time which could better be spent in actual de- velopment work. This paper describes steps taken by Robert Bosch GmbH in its new engine test lab- oratory, to streamline procedures for observation, computation, plotting, and presentation of results. Measurements from the engine test cell are delivered electrically to a central data processing center. These data are recorded, computed electronically, and plotted on an electric plotting machine functioning from punched paper tape. 660752. Super Pumper System- New Concept in Fire-Fighting. Paul J. Erickson, Gibbs and Cox Inc.; John Lehoczky, Jr., Mack 660750-660755 Trucks, Inc.; and John T. O'Hagen, New York City Fire Dept. The Super Pumper System is the world's most powerful land based fire fighting apparatus. It was developed and constructed by Mack Trucks, Inc. from an original concept and preliminary designs prepared by Gibbs &amp; Cox, Inc. It consists of five vehicles. The main vehicle is the Super Pumper which carries a high vol√πme, high pressure pump driven by a lightweight diesel en- gine. Water from remote sources can be supplied to the other four vehicles, (a super tender and three satellite tenders) providing great flexibility of opera- tion. The system has been in use by the New York City Fire Department for one year. This paper describes the original concept of the system, its development by Mack, and its use by the New York City Fire Department. 660754. Efficiency and Performance Charac- teristics of Radial Turbines. Colin Rod- gers, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. Results are presented of a study directed toward providing a method of estimating radial turbine effi- ciency levels and performance characteristics, based upon summation of the individual component losses and applicable energy relationships. The magnitudes and divisions of the component losses have been de- veloped to closely coincide with actual turbine test data obtained at the author's company, and have been integrated into a method of obtaining the com- plete turbine characteristic once the turbine geome- try and operating conditions are prescribed. Because of the lack of radial cascade data, the use of a so- called one-dimensional flow theory is employed, supported by theoretical cascade analysis and ad- justed by empirical means to satisfy the strong three- dimensional flow conditions that can exist in a radial turbine, particularly at off-design conditions. The results of the study include a comparison between actual test and computed performance of an experi- mental low specific speed radial turbine, which shows acceptable correlation, thus verifying the esti- mation procedure. 1967 SAE Transactions 660755.

Gas Turbine Power Pack for Automo- tive Propulsion - Review of Alternative Solutions. W. Hryniszak and M. A. Jacob- son, Clarke, Chapman and Co., Ltd. Although the gas turbine offers many advantages for long distance commercial vehicle applications, cer- tain improvements must be made before it can suc- cessfully compete with the highly developed recip- rocating piston engine. Both types of engines are compared on a thermodynamic basis to indicate their inherent characteristics and to show the extent to which various performance properties can be suc- cessfully matched to the gas turbine. One power unit, the split compressor differential gas turbine, is proposed as offering distinct benefits over the gas turbine types currently being developed. Its design features, operation, and performance in a contin- uing development program are described. 1967 SAE Transactions 660760. Power Transmission Systems for Tur- bine Engine Vehicles. P. J.

The power transmission components can be modified to ac- commodate the new requirements. As turbine en- gines become more popular a more optimum ap- proach to power transmissions is needed. Some rea- sonable possibilities are discussed. The manner in which components have been ap- plied and the results obtained along with future pos- sibilities are covered in the area of clutches, me- chanical transmissions, and drivelines and axles, 660761. Vehicle Electric Drive Systems. Alexan- der Kusko, Massachusetts Inst, of Tech- nology; and Lee T. Magnuson, Deere and Co. The combination of a high-speed prime mover and a wide range of wheelspeeds in an off-the-road vehicle makes an electric system look attractive for driving the wheels. An electric drive system is easily rever- sible, can apply power independently to each wheel, and lends itself to various types of electric and auto- matic control. Off-the-road vehicles usually demand that the maximum available horsepower of the prime mover be available at the wheels over a wide speed range, requiring that the drive be a so-called constant horse- power type. Since electric motors are inherently con- stant torque devices, their use as drive elements re- quires that compromises be made in motor frame size and in the use of gear reduction and shifting to meet a particular vehicle requirement. One type of drive system that represents a good compromise between the features of a-c and d-c drives is the system using a wound-rotor induction motor and a static rotor-circuit inverter connected to pump power back to the stator line. This system has the control characteristics of a d-c system and re- quires a relatively trouble-free type of static inverter for its operation. Work has been done with this sys- tem for cranes and other industrial applications, but not for vehicle drives. The characteristics and appli- cation of the drive to off-the-road vehicles will be treated in this paper as an example of a possible approach to the electric drive problem. Discussion: Carl J.

The automotive engineer must be constantly aware of many changing factors to produce vehicles suit- able for highway operation several years in the fu- ture. The design is predominantly affected by road size and weight restrictions. In the near future, de- sign of highway vehicles may be influenced by Fed- eral legislation based on House Document No. 354. This document is inconsistent in several areas and will not give the operator the benefits which it appears to offer on the surface. If adopted, vehicle 660762-660768 design will be affected as will horsepower require- ments. Safety legislation as well as changes in trans- portation means will also affect vehicle design, all of which must be considered in the overall picture. 660766. Future Fuels for Automotive Gas Tur- bines. Leonard Raymond, Mobil Oil Co. The two most important characteristics of gas turbine fuel requirements are high temperature corrosion characteristics and radiation effects on metal temper- atures. One problem area is that sulfur attack takes place even with relatively low concentrations of sul- fur in the fuel and is accelerated by increased tem- perature. A solution to this problem has beerrthe use of more resistant alloys or protective coatings. Some conclusions pertaining to radiation effect are (a) fuel composition affects radiant heat transfer, (b) combustor design can have a significant effect on metal temperature and life, (c) minimum flame radia- tion is desirable for minimum metal temperature and increased engine life. Engine deposits are fuel and engine interrelated and, as the author points out, gas turbine engineers have been able to design around fuel deposition ten- dencies with considerable success to date. In conclu- sion, it is believed that the oil industry will meet quality and supply requirements which may result from commercialization of the automotive gas tur- bine engine. 660767. Lubricant Requirements of Engines of the Future. Robert E. Jeffrey and Law- rence G. Boschma, Shell Oil Co. Engine lubricating oils have responded to the in- creasingly severe requirements introduced by en- gine design improvements for more than thirty years. It is expected that design trends in the future will be continuations of the past and current ones for the most part. This means that lubricants for future pis- ton engines must have improved dispersancy, ther- mal and oxidative stability, as well as improved boundary lubrication capability. The latter is espec- ially important and will require serious effort on the part of the engine designer and metallurgist, in com- pany with the lubricant designer. Mineral oils will be improved and, with improved additive combina- tions, will continue to serve engine needs far into the future. Synthetic materials will not challenge them seriously for at least the next decade, princi- pally for economic reasons. However, synthetics will be required, as they are now, for industrialized aircraft gas turbines. 660768. Theoretical Performance of Ammonia as a Gas Turbine Fuel. H. K. Newhall and E. S. Starkman, California Univ. The performance of ammonia as a fuel for gas tur- 151</page><page sequence="93">660769-660775 bine application has been thoretically predicted. Regenerative and nonregenerative Brayton cycles were employed as theoretical models, and combus- tion products were treated as a chemical equilibri- um reactive system. All calculations were carried out by programs developed for use on an IBM 7094 digital computer. The results indicate that ammonia should be superior to hydrocarbons as a fuel on the basis of output and efficiency, but poorer on the basis of fuel economy. 1967 SAE Transactions 660769. Experimental Investigation of Ammonia as a Gas Turbine Engine Fuel. M. G. Bull, and J. R. Shekelton, International Harvester Co., Solar Div.; and Donald D. Faehn, Army Engr. Res. and Dev. Labs. Two types of ammonia combustion systems were developed and engine tested. One system was simi- lar to a conventional hydrocarbon can combustor, except that a much larger combustor volume was necessary to increase residence time and compen- sate for the reduced fuel flammability. The other sys- tem incorporated an oxidizing catalyst bed, integral with the combustor, as a means of increasing fuel reaction rate and reducing combustor volume. A con- trol system was developed to maintain constant cata- lyst bed temperature by regulating combustion air/ fuel ratio. Combustor efficiencies obtained were comparable with equivalent hydrocarbon combus- tors. 660771. (SP-282) Four Decades of Engine-Fuel Technology Forecast Future Advances.

Preliminary observations are offered about relation- ships between lubricant composition and formation of deposits in crankcase ventilation systems. Ashless dispersants, metallo-organic soaps, and base oils con- tribute to deposit control.

The 150,000-mile field test was run in ur- ban buses powered by a popular make of United States two-stroke cycle diesel engine. It was found that the best field deposit control was obtained with an oil containing a high level of succinimide (ash- less dispersant). The parallel program showed that the laboratory engine tests did not predict relative field performance regarding ring sticking or sludge and varnish deposit control. Discussion: J. A. Creedon and D.

Ghandi, Outboard Marine Corp. The most important, and obvious, requirement of a lubricant is that it lubricate. In outboard engines, the stress the lubricant is placed under can also be af- fected by its deposit producing characteristics. No reliable screening means appears available to study deposit forming tendencies and full-scale engine tests have to be undertaken. Some data from such tests are presented.

Combined efforts by oil companies and engine manufacturers have improved the overall efficiency and performance of two-cycle gasoline engines. One striking trend has been toward the use of leaner oil-fuel mixtures to accomplish lubrication. The use of less oil reduces smoking and air pollution (impor- tant in two-cycle automotive engine operation), reduces engine port deposits, preignition, and cost of operation. Experience has shown that the compo- sition of the oil becomes increasingly important as its concentration in the fuel is reduced. Lean mix- tures of some conventional oils are not satisfactory, and with all oils some lower concentration is reached where serious problems are encountered, such as lack of lubrication, increased engine wear, and de- creased engine cleanliness. This paper reviews the problems involved in the development of oils specifically for operation as lean mixture lubricants in water-cooled outboard en- gines, European two-cycle automotive engines, and small aircooled engines. Although the problems vary in each type of engine, data are given on the effect of concentration of lubricants on various perform- ance problems including engine cleanliness, spark plug fouling, preignition, lubrication, rusting and corrosion. 660777. Laboratory Engine Test for Two-Cycle, Spark Ignition Gas Engine Lubricants. W. D. Dysart, Pure Oil Co. A laboratory engine test method for predicting lubri- cant performance both quickly and economically in two-cycle gas burning engines is described. Follow- ing preliminary test work covering the effects of such variables as engine output on deposit levels, piston height setting, and cylinder lubricant feed rate, a test procedure was evolved which showed reason- able correlation with field results. Tests conducted using a variety of nondetergent lubricants indicated both good and bad features in base oil performance. It was concluded that with careful selection of the detergent-inhibitor additive (either ashless or metal- lic type), the shortcomings of a particular base oil can be minimized and good overall results obtained. 660778. Friction Characteristics of Controlled- Slip Differential Lubricants. M. L. Havi- land M. C. Goodwin, and J. J. Rodgers, General Motors Res. Labs. Controlled-slip differentials (CSD) improve car oper- 660776-660780 ation under wheel slipping conditions. The perform- ance of CSD's is dependent upon two criteria asso- ciated with clutch friction: "chatter" and "effective- ness." "Chatter" is an undesirable noise which may occur during differential action. "Effectiveness" is a measure of the ability of the CSD clutches to transfer torque, during wheel slippage, to the wheel with the greater traction. The objective of this investigation was to definitely establish the cause of chatter, meas- ure CSD effectiveness, and relate friction character- istics of lubricants to CSD operation. In tests with an instrumented car, it was found that both chatter and effectiveness are strongly influ- enced by the lubricant. Chatter occurred with lubri- cants that produced an increase in clutch friction with decreasing sliding speed. Chatter did not occur with lubricants containing friction modifiers which produced a decrease in clutch friction with decreas- ing sliding speed. Unfortunately, these friction modi- fiers also reduced the CSD effectiveness by reducing the clutch friction. To simulate CSD clutch plate sliding under more closely controlled laboratory conditions, the R-H Friction Apparatus was built. Results with this ap- paratus were correlated with those obtained with the car. Also deterioration of CSD lubricant friction characteristics in car service was confirmed with the R-H Friction Apparatus. Discussion: A. J. Balfour, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc.; J. M.

Mode of Action of Tetraethyllead and Supplemental Antiknock Agents. L. B. Graiff, Shell Oil Co., Wood River Res. Lab. Studies aimed at elucidating the mode of action of tetraethyllead and of supplemental antiknock agents have revealed the nature of the real antiknock species derived from tel. The degradation products of tel which are present in the exhaust of a motored engine support the theory that tel functions as an antiknock by forming a "fog" of lead oxide particles in the end-gas zone. Moreover, the composition of the lead oxide particles appears to determine the relative antiknock effectiveness of tei in a given fuel. 153</page><page sequence="95">660781-660785 Red lead monoxide particles with a distorted tetra- gonal crystal structure are indicated to be the most active antiknock degradation product of tel.

Bradow, Texaco, Inc. Gas sampling and analysis techniques developed for studying preflame reactions were applied to deter- mine combustion chamber formation of inorganic materials found in spark-ignition engine exhaust. Results show that oxides of nitrogen are flame- formed, decay somewhat in the post flame gases, and then are "frozen" from further decomposition. The exhaust nitrogen oxide concentration is a weighted average of the spatial- and time-dependent combus- tion chamber concentrations. Organic exhaust constituents contributed by combustion - chamber slow - combustion reactions were chromato graphically found to include olefins, aldehydes, ketones, and ring ethers when operating with isooctane fuel. Addition of tel to the fuel inhi- bits slow-combustion reactivity reducing concentra- tions of slow-combustion products in the exhaust. 1967 SAE Transactions 660782. Evaluating Carburetor Detergent Per- formance. E. L. Tandrup, Ethyl Corp. The increasing desirability in recent years of a deter- gent in motor gasoline to keep the carburetor throttle body free of deposits has accentuated the need for techniques to evaluate the clean-up performance of such detergents. The basic procedure described here involves a comparative technique using a fixed photographic setup to obtain photographs of carbure- tor throttle-body deposits at various intervals during field service tests. In addition, carefully controlled dynamometer tests are used to determine deposit effects on fuel economy. The two test procedures are described and typical results are given. 660783. Bench Technique for Evaluating the Induction System Deposit Tendencies of Motor Gasolines. Alan A. Johnston and Edward Dimitro ff, Southwest Res. Inst. A technique for determining induction system de- posit (ISD) tendencies of a gasoline is described. The technique uses a bench apparatus, designed to simulate the valve and port area of an engine intake system, which provides deposit data correlative to real engines. The apparatus is compact, requires a minimal fuel sample, uses a retainable metal tube as the deposit collecting surface, and has good re- peatability. Design of the equipment eliminates the possibility of deposit contamination by dirt, rust and lead precipitate, and both solvent-washed and un- washed data may be obtained. ASTM Gum, engine intake deposit weights, and ISD technique data are compared to illustrate the capabilities of this new technique. 660784. Mechanism of Induction System Depos- it Formation. Edward Dimitroff and Alan A. Johnston, Southwest Res. Inst. Basic information on gasolines which cause damag- ing induction system (intake port and valve) deposits in ground vehicle engines was obtained. Several fuels of known depositing tendencies were charcoal filtered and the adsorbant extracted with chloroform and acetone. The adsorbant was then eluted with iso- propyl alcohol in a silica gel column to obtain a con- centrate. This concentrate was further subdivided in a column of magnesium silicate by a repeated elu- tion sequence using n-pentane and methanol, ob- taining a 97 per cent all inclusive induction system deposit extract- representing about 10-500 ppm of the fuel. The results were confirmed by both bench and engine tests. An identification of these induc- tion system deposit precursors was made by means of elemental, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and mass spectral analyses. The induction system deposit precursors were found to consist primarily of long chain oxygen and nitrogen containing compounds such as amides and carboxylic acids. Representative samples of these compounds were purchased or synthesized and their induction system, deposit tendencies determined. Electron spin resonance experiments were con- ducted which showed that the conversion of the in- duction system deposit precursors to induction sys- tem deposits is a free radical reaction. The induction system deposits were analyzed, and their chemical composition determined. Finally, the mechanism of induction system deposit formation in terms of its chemistry was formulated. 1967 SAE Transactions 660785. (P-12) General Motors Energy-Absorb- ing Steering Column. P. C.

D. M. Severy, California Univ. Light bulb filaments from motor vehicles involved in collisions provide valuable objective information on accident causation. For most moderate-to-severe collisions at least one light bulb of the car will offer useful evidence to the investigator. Changes de- picted by one bulb may be so conclusive as to allow considerable insight into the status of vehicle lights and related factors at the time of the collision. This paper presents the classifications of automo- bile light bulb filament changes brought about by collision and the significance of such changes.

(P-12) Impact Dynamics of Unre- strained, Lap Belted, and Lap and Diag- onal Chest Belted Vehicle Occupants. Lawrence M. Patrick and Harold J. Mertz, Jr., Wayne State Univ.; Charles K. Kroell, General Motors Res. Labs. A comparison of the forces, accelerations, and kine- matics of an anthropomorphic dummy is presented for identical sled impacts for unrestrained, lap belted, and lap and diagonal chest restrained conditions. Biaxial accelerometers were mounted in the head, chest, and on the proximal end of the femur to ob- tain the accelerations during the impacts. Seat belt loadcells were put in series with the belts at each anchor point. Biaxial load cells were positioned to be impacted by the head, chest, and each knee for the unre- 660786-660791 strained condition and by the head and chest for the lap belted configuration. For the lap and diagonal chest restrained condition these load cells were not used. Impacts of 10 and 20 mph were made with sled stopping distance of 4 and 9 in., respectively. At 20 mph the head struck with a force of 1580 lb in the unrestrained mode, 600 lb with the lap belt, and did not hit with the lap and shoulder harness. The corresponding A-P head accelerations were 80, 67, and 45 g's. The total lap belt load was 3500 lb for the lap belt only. With the lap and cross chest combination the lap belt load was 2260 lb and the cross chest belt load was 2245 lb for total load of 4505 lb. Displacements of the hip, shoulder, and head, as measured from high-speed movies, are presented graphically. 660790. (P-12) Comprehensive Vehicle Safety Development at Daimler-Benz A.C. K. F. Wilfert, Daimler-Benz AG. In recent years, "safety" has become the subject of worldwide discussions. This single word is used to describe various features and functions of a vehicle. This paper attempts to separate the confused defini- tions which have arisen in this area, and to classify the main problems under clear definitions, namely, "active safety" and "passive safety." Safety features should be measurable, that is, expressed in numerical form with minimum values specified through regulations based on practical ex- periments. This need is related to the fundamental change in vehicle body engineering which has taken place. Former empirical methods of developing pas- senger car bodies will be replaced by methods ori- ginating from basic and functional considerations. Through these observations, aerodynamics and safe- ty will become the primary factors in development programs. 660791. (P-12) Computer Implemented Design of Automobile Interiors. Charles E. Aus- tin, R. A. Brauburger, and S. C. Kansal, Chrysler Corp. Comprehensive computer program has been devel- oped as a design aid in order to establish the direc- tion to safer automobile interior designs. Until complete accident statistics and biomedical data to allow occupant injury evaluation are included in the program, preliminary evaluations are possible through analysis of the occupant forces, velocities, decelerations, and energies. Development of the computer program and its application in the design of automobile interiors is discussed. An outline of a basic experiment which investigates the effects and interactions of six primary vehicle parameters is also presented. 155</page><page sequence="97">660792-660796 660792. (P-12) Computer Simulation of the Crash Victim- A Validation Study. Raymond R. McHenry and Kenneth N. Naab, Cor- nell Aero. Lab. A program of research was conducted to examine the validity of a digital computer simulation of an auto- mobile occupant during a frontal, head-on collision. The simulation is designed to permit a detailed study of the effects of several types of restraint systems on occupant responses in a confined compartment, where injury-producing contact forces occur. The effects on occupant responses produced by the posi- tions, orientations, and load-deflection properties of contacted interior surfaces are also simulated. This progress report covers one phase of a CAL long- range program of development of simulation tech- niques for study of occupant/vehicle and vehicle/ob- stacle collision responses. Detailed comparisons are presented of responses from instrumented sled tests and corresponding com- puted responses from the simulation. The compari- sons include forces in restraint belts and on con- tacted surfaces, accelerations of the dummy, and the detailed kinematics of the dummy itself. The results of repeat experimental runs of several of the test con- ditions are also displayed. It is concluded that the comparisons between simulated and experimental time-histories show good agreement in the timing of events, the occu- pant kinematics, the general levels of peak values, and the waveforms of responses, in view of recog- nized shortcomings in some of the parameter data and recognized limitations imposed by simplified analytical representations. 660793. (P-12) Use of a Weighted-Impulse Cri- terion for Estimating Injury Hazard. C. W. Gadd, General Motors Res. Labs. The usage of an exponential weighting factor for ap- praising deceleration or force impulses registered on dummies or impacting hammers in safety testing is described. The proposed impulse-integration pro- cedure takes into account in a more rational way, and in better conformity with published injury toler- ance data, the relative importance of time and inten- sity of the pulse than do the "peak g" or impulse- area criteria. The new Severity Index is used for as- sessment of head impact pulses. It is of special value in comparing the relative severity of pulses which differ markedly in shape (because of structural dif- ferences in the component being struck). Without a weighting factor of this nature, laboratory impact tests can yield incorrect ranking of the relative safety merit of alternative designs. Automated methods for quick calculation of the Severity Index are possible. 660794. (P-12) New Look at Fuel System Design Criteria. S. H. Robertson, Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. Accident statistics indicate that postcrash fire is one of the most serious threats to human life in aircraft crashes. It is also a serious threat in automotive crashes. Several methods are available to reduce this hazard. The simplest and most effective method is through control of the fuel spillage. Aircraft crash testing has shown that fuel systems incorporating tough, flexible fuel tanks that are smooth in contour, free from rigid attachments, and mated with flexible fluid lines are capable of preventing fuel spillage during crashes involving decelerative loading above the human surivival range. 660795. (P-12) Measurement of Detailed Inertial Properties and Dimensions of a 50th P ercentile Anthropometric Dummy. K. N. Naab, Cornell Aero. Lab., Inc. The dimensions and inertial properties of the seg- ments of an Alderson, 50th percentile anthropomet- ric dummy were measured. The dummy, model F- 50-AU, was disassembled into 10 main segments and measurements of weights, lengths, center-of-gravity positions, and moments-of-inertia were performed on each segment. Lengths were measured directly with a scale and weights were determined on a scale balance. A "balance test" was performed on each segment to determine its center-of-gravity position. Moment-of-inertia data were measured by means of a torsional pendulum apparatus. A comparison is presented of these data with measured data of a Swedish dummy, type DV, and available human ca- daver data. Segment properties of the Alderson dummy com- pare closely with those of the cadaver study. The torso plus head moment-of-inertia, however, appears to be approximately 31 per cent smaller than meas- ured data from a cadaver. Comparison of Alderson segment data with the Swedish measurements show the two dummies to be similar except in the torso region. Again, the Alderson torso is lighter and has less moment-of-inertia than the Swedish dummy. Ac- curacy of the measured moments-of-inertia of Aider- son dummy segments on the torsional pendulum are from 1 to 2 per cent. 660796. (P-12) Impact Protection by Isovolu- metric Containment of the Torso. C. F. Lombard and S. H. Advani, Northrop Space Labs. Prevalent support-restraint systems used by occu- pants in vehicles employ a restraint which permits lateral and forward movement of the mid section of the torso. Depending on the acceleration profile 156</page><page sequence="98">variables, the internal organs and tissues are dis- torted with varying degrees of injury resulting. The dynamic response of the organs during impact can be studied by the many degrees of freedom spring- mass system representation. In contrast to this ap- proach, the confinement of the torso in a flexible but essentially isovolumetric support-restraint system minimizes distortion and in essence allows the or- gans and bones "to float." Experimental verification has been obtained, using animals as test subjects, to indicate that survival limits, may be considerably enhanced by this method of containment. 660797. (P-12) Development of Safety Seating for Injury Prevention. B. C. Hilton, Cox of Watford Ltd. British medical and road safety research teams have revealed the need for improvement in vehicle seat- ing designs to eliminate serious injuries and deaths arising from car occupant movement and ejection during impact. The paper describes the main requirements of safety seating and the result of three years develop- ment work in Britain to produce effective seats and mountings of low cost, capable of being fitted into conventional vehicles and of coping with forward loads of over 30 g. It is estimated that the adoption of such seats would increase the vehicle cost by less than 2 per cent. 660798. (P-12) Effect of Rapid Loading Rates on the Stress-Strain Properties of Re- straint Webbing. J. L. Haley, Jr., Flight Safety Foundation. Stress-strain data for nylon and dacron webbing of 5500 and 6000 lb strengths are presented for quasis- tatic and very rapid loading rates up to about 450, 000 lb per sec. The preliminary data indicates that the stress-strain slope is about twice as great with both materials for the rapid loading rates. The re- sults also indicate that the failure load is the slightly higher (6 to 18 per cent) for the rapid loading. The variation of the stress-strain slope with a changed loading rate will undoubtedly have an effect on the prediction of loads and accelerations for crash re- straint systems in all types of vehicles. 660799. (P-12) Radiographic Studies on Cardiac Displacement During Abrupt Decelera- tion. P. G. Hanson, Air Force Aeromedi- cal Res. Lab. Abrupt deceleration associated with vehicle crash environments commonly produces rupture of the heart and great vessels of the thoracic cavity. A study of the mechanism of these lesions has yielded a series of high-speed radiographs obtained at selected 660797-660801 time intervals during controlled deceleration. Light- ly anesthetized Beagle dogs were rigidly restrained in form-fitted stafoam capsules and subjected to ¬±Gz impact on the Bopper and Daisy Decelerator. Flash radiographs were taken with a Flexitron Model 233 (300 kv) X-ray puiser initiated by microswitch on the decelerator track. Preliminary data indicate that the heart under- goes considerable inertial movement during decel- eration. These observations suggest that the mechan- ism of vessel rupture may involve mechanical tear- ing from violent displacement of the heart and dia- phragm. (The experiments reported herein were con- ducted according to the "Principles of Animal Care" established by the National Society for Medical Re- search.) 660800. (P-12) Heart Motion Due to Blunt Trau- ma to the Thorax. V. L. Roberts, F. R. Jackson, and E. M. Berkas, Wayne State Univ. The displacement of heart due to blunt trauma to the thorax has been shown to be a factor in the intimai and medial lesions of the aorta and great vessels. This displacement has been verified by means of high-speed flash x-rays taken during impact to the thorax of living animals. These x-ray findings corro- borate the previous work by the authors and yield further insight into the mechanism of formation of the intimai and medial tears of the aorta and great vessels. The paper shows the results of this research and substantiates the mechanism by means of the roentgenograms taken during the impacts. 660801. (P-12) Impact Injury to the Pregnant Female and Fetus in Lap Belt Restraint. R. G. Snyder, Ford Motor Co.; Warren M. Crosby, Oklahoma Univ. School of Medi- cine; Clyde C. Snow, Federal Aviation Agency; James Prine, and Jerry Fineg, Air Force Dept.; and Peter G. Hanson, Air Force Aeronautical Res. Lab. Although it has been well established that the lap (seat) belt offers considerable protection against injury or death in crash environments, there has long been controversy over the injury potential to the pregnant female. This question is of importance in consideration of restraint and seat protective envi- ronments for both aircraft and automotive vehicles. Most of the 4 million pregnant women per year in the United States travel by automobile, with a large number traveling by Commercial Civil Aircraft or the Military Air Transport Service. Thus a sizable population is involved. This combined study by the Civil Aeromedicai 157</page><page sequence="99">660802-660805 Institute, F. A. A., 6571st Aeromedicai Research Lab- oratory, Holloman AFB, and the University of Okla- homa School of Medicine, has been concerned with the clinical, experimental and applied aspects. Tests utilizing pregnant baboons (Papio doguera) have been run on the Holloman AFB Daisy Decelerator, and clinical case histories have been obtained in automotive accidents involving late term pregnant women through cooperation of the California and Oklahoma Highway Patrol and individual obste- tricians. This paper will outline the medical evi- dence for concern and note the experimental find- ings to date. 660802. (P-12) Ejection- Leading Cause of Death in Fatal Automobile Accidents. Donald F. Huelke, and Paul W. Gikas, Michigan Univ., School of Medicine. From on-scene investigations of 139 fatal automobile accidents during four years, it was found that of 177 persons killed, 48, or 27 per cent, died by ejection, which is thus the leading cause of death. As would be expected, most (two-thirds) were ejected through opened doors; others were ejected through wind- shields, open convertible roofs, or door windows. From the investigations it is postulated that 80 per cent of the ejection deaths would have been pre- vented had they worn seat belts. 660803. (P-12) Cause of Significant Injuries in Nonfatal Traffic Accidents. A. M. Na- hum, Arnold W. Siegel, and Stanford B. Trachtenberg, California Univ. School of Medicine. The Vehicular Trauma Research Group of the UCLA School of Medicine is currently conducting inten- sive studies of selected traffic accidents. Data are presented from an analysis of the first 150 traffic ac- cidents studied. The role of vehicular design, me- chanical failure and the performance of the new 1966 windshield in injury causation are discussed and illustrative examples are presented. The importance of detailed studies of traffic accidents is stressed as a method of yielding information not readily avail- able by other methods of study. This approach is mandatory to evaluate new and pending vehicular design modifications and may be the only method of detecting and assessing the role of mechanical failure in traffic accident causation. 660804. (P-12) Role of "Whiplash" in Cerebral Concussion. A. K. Ommaya, Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness; A. Hirsch, Taylor/David/Model Basin; and John L. Martinez, Tulane Univ. An attempt to summarize and correlate the possible injurious mechanisms occurring in whiplash and head injury by impact is presented. The relation be- tween whiplash and cerebral concussion has been investigated in two ways. First, it is demonstrated that a collar restricting bending and twisting but not stretching of the neck, as well as reducing rotational acceleration of the head, significantly raises the threshold for experimental cerebral concussion pro- duced by occipital blows to the freely moveable head in monkeys. Secondly, experimental whiplash with- out head impact in the monkey can produce signifi- cant reduction of standard responses to external stim- uli. It is suggested that multiple mechanisms are involved in cerebral concussion, among them rota- tional acceleration of the head, flexion-extension- tension of the neck and intracranial pressure grad- ients being probably the most significant. The direc- tion of future investigation is indicated. 660805. (P-12) Review of Air Force Research on Biodynamics of Collision Injury. J. P. S tapp, Armed Forces Inst, of Pathology. Previously unpublished experiments and results for biological injury encountered in aircraft situations are summarized. Acceleration forces exceed primary acceleration of catapult due to oscillations excited between the man-seat system. Theory behind calcu- lation of these effects is reported. Confirming test results on humans and animals given. Extensive bibliography on Air Force investigations included. 158</page></plain_text>
