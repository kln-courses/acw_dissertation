<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOUTH-EASTERN ELEMENTS IN THE PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION OF SERBIA * Under the same title M. M. Vasid published an article forty years ago, which was then the first step towards a systematic study of the connections between the Aegean area and the Serbian and North Balkan spheres.' M. Vasid's article was the first result of the first systematic researches at Vinia, the most important site of the Northern Balkans. From this time on many excavations have been made at Vinia and other prehistoric sites, and the material has piled up too rapidly for scientific evaluation to cope with.2 As the past forty years, ending with World War II and the subsequent events in Yugoslavia, must no doubt be reckoned an entire phase in the history of this study, it seems appropriate now to attempt to give a summary of the results so far gained. Before coming to our real topic, it will be necessary to clear up the question of relative chronology. The permanent basis of this has always been M. Vasid's illuminating and important excavations at Vinia, although an exhaustive summary has not yet been completed. The four volumes of the large-scale Vinia publication and numerous articles,3 and also the use of the material in the Vinia Museum and the National Museum (Beograd), permit one, however, to draw a clear chronological picture. The results from all other excavations fit into this picture without difficulty. The section, which is more than 1o05 m. deep, makes it easy to develop a relative chronology, 1 M.

The prehistoric settlement at Vinia originated on an almost horizontal terrace of clay, but, in the course of time, a tell developed over the settled surface, as in other prehistoric settlements in South-Eastern Europe. The highest point of this hill was taken in 1911 as point o-oo (Kote V o.oo), down- ward from which the depth of individual finds was counted. Though the pit-dwellings which were dug into the clay lie at the same height, the surface of the hill is not flat, but broken. Therefore the contemporary house-remains and objects discovered, though they are equally high above the original level, do not lie at the same depth if measurement is made from the surface down- ward. In order to change the relative minuses into absolute depths below datum it will be necessary to add the vertical distance below datum of the surface on the spot where each object was found.4 This conversion is the main difficulty in using the work. The second difficulty is produced by the fact that the excavation, and the publication also, was made according to a preconceived plan, without regard to different strata and pits. The soil was dug in layers of ten centimetres each, and the objects were marked only according to their depth.5 The existing ditches and disturbances of the layers were disregarded (with the exception of the single groups of pottery found in some houses), so that it sometimes occurs that comparatively recent objects are published as contemporary with older ones, although they got into the older strata only by subsequent movements of earth." If all these facts are noted and if the as yet unpublished material (the four volumes present a rich variety) and excavations on other sites are taken into considera- tion, a clear chronological picture can easily be drawn. RELATION OF VINEA TO STARCEVO When I checked the whole material according to these rules in 1940-I, I obtained the result that the Starievo culture (named after the site near the village of Starievo on the Danube bank opposite Vinia) 7 is without doubt older than the Vinia culture itself.8 It was evident that some of the pits dug in the clay at Vinia contain only Vinia remains and some only Starievo remains. Only in a single case were the remains of both cultures intermingled. Moreover it is very significant that the percentage of Starievo remains 4 M. Vasit, P. Vinda II (1936), Io9.

Ihls conclusion is turther emphasized by the results of the excavations at Starievo itself. Though the site of Starievo is situated at a distance of only five kilometres from Vinia, and there are plenty</page><page sequence="4">THE PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION OF SERBIA 261 of Vinia settlements on both left and right banks of the Danube,9 not a single piece of Vinia manufacture was found here. Hence it is beyond doubt that the two cultures cannot have had their climax at the same time; the Starievo culture must have been the older one. This is confirmed by con- ditions on other sites, such as Kremenjak near Aradac,1o Skela near Beograd,n Vuiedol (the oldest stratum) near Vukovar,12 "Obala" near Korbovo,13 " Obala " near Velesnica,14 Kavolak near Prokuplje,15 Bubanj,16 Vrtilte 17 and Kovanluk,18 all of them near NiB, and so on. The stratigraphical situation is repeated on the site near the village of Pavlovac, on the water- shed between the Morava and Vardar valleys.19 The trial excavations made by Count A. Orssich-Slavetich showed that here the lowest horizon is a stratum with Starievo manufactures. This is covered by a stratum with typical products of the older Vinia culture, which again is covered by a stratum of the Bubanj culture, still to be discussed. A more detailed examination of the Starievo material shows clearly that the Starievo culture was by no means a short-lived one. Its development lasted a long time, and by virtue ofstratigraphical and typological-geographical observations this time can be divided into four main periods. It is not my task here to refer in detail to these periods, as this has been done already in another place,20 but they should at least be depicted briefly and substantiated by the most essential stratigraphical-chronological evidence. THE STARCEVO CULTURE The first period is mainly characterised by the so-called barbotine vases. This ware was made from well-levigated clay, to which organic substances such as straw and chaff are occasionally added. The surface is a yellowish brown, but the core, owing to incomplete firing, remained black. The main shapes are globular bowls with incurved rims, storage vessels and small pots of low, conical form; in almost every case the base is thickened or stands on a hollow pedestal (Fig. 2. 16, 17, 19). There are also hemispherical bowls with or without pedestal (Fig. 2. 15, 18). The base is sometimes rounded (Fig. 2. I4). The decorative elements of this period consist mainly of finger-nail impressions and pinching, and of small, broad furrows drawn 9 Pan evo and Kovin, material in Museums of Pantevo and Vriac. 10 F.

MILOJC;I with a blunt-nosed tool (Fig. 2. 1-3, 7). Sometimes crude pellets of clay were thrown on the surface. Red-slipped painted wares are not yet known in this period. This period is assured by stratigraphical observations at Starievo, where this ware was found in the bottom level of the section.21 On various sites of the Starievo culture this ware has been found alone,22 from which may be inferred that there was in fact a period in which it was the prevalent domestic ware. The second period carries on the 'barbotine' tradition in the same way, but some new details appear. At first a new red-slipped ware becomes frequent. The clay of this ware is equally well levigated and never contains organic substances. The core is blackish, but near the surface the clay takes a yellowish-brown hue. The inner and outer surfaces were covered by a red slip. The inside of amphorae and the underside of pedestals are un- painted. This ware often shows painted decoration in white or dark brown. It is typical that the motives in white show a markedly rectilinear character. The commonest decorative elements are groups of lines (Fig. 2. 4, 6), bordered by two broad ones (Fig. 2. Io); cross-hatching bordered by broad lines (Fig. 2. 5, 8); chequers, hatched triangles, etc. (Fig. 2. 9). The decoration shows a radial arrangement, which is especially characteristic of this group. Towards the end of this period dark-on-light painting seems to become more frequent. Semicircles and scrolls appear below the rims of bowls. This class gradually develops into a ware with a finely burnished, but never polished, surface, varying in colour between light and dark brown. A rare black slipped ware also seems to belong to this period. At Starievo and Vinia there have been found only a few pieces of this ware; 23 they differ essentially in form and manufacture, although M. Vasid counted the Vinea pieces as belonging to the ordinary black monochrome Vinia ware. While the usual black monochrome Vinia vases, called 'bucchero' by Vasid,24 are of a uniform greyish black in the break, and their black surface is given by the clay itself, the clay of the black Starievo vases varies in colour with firing, as in other fabrics. The core is black and towards the inner and outer surface the clay takes a yellowish hue. The black surface is caused by a slip which often flakes off, revealing the light coloured clay. The surface on ware of this period is lustrous, but no traces of a polishing tool are visible. The third period is characterised by black and polychrome painted ware with curvilinear decoration. The coarse barbotine ware is of less importance, but is better fired and shows monochrome in the break like all other fabrics; 21 V. Fewkes, op. cit., 27, n. Io9; 33. 22 Id., Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.

The burnish unslipped ware becomes more frequent and to a great extent replaces the coarse barbotine. It too is better fired. Red-slipped vases occur more frequently, black-slipped ones have disappeared. As for the painted wares, white goes completely out of use; this is very characteristic, since motives of the second period are never painted according to the polychrome technique. The new technique shows, beside polychrome painting, a use of deep black on a red or yellowish ground, with curvilinear motives. Real spiral motives are rare, fanciful scroll motives are commoner; there is a tendency towards spiraliform motives (Fig. 2. I I, 13). The main difference between the second and third periods, however, is that the latter prefers horizontal arrangement of decoration, while in the second period radial arrangement is most frequent. The polychrome ware, black on white or red or yellow, has the same decorative elements. A clean stratigraphical division of these last two periods has not been given hitherto, though stratigraphical observation shows that they are later than the first period. The differences in style and technique would alone be enough to justify a division of the material, but there are other reasons too. Thus the division is justified by oral communications made by M. Grbid, who excavated himself in Starievo and also attended American excavations undertaken there later.25 According to him geometrically painted vases with rectilinear patterns were the main finds in some of the pits, while in others curvilinear spiraliform patterns came to light. More- over it has been observed that on some sites there was only geometrical pottery of the second period with rectilinear designs, and on other sites only curvilinear spiraliform decoration was found. Thus we have vases of the second period at Bubanj,26 Kavolak,27 Pavlovci,28 Vinia,29 Vuiedol 30o and Sarval,31 and of the third period at Vrtiste 32 and Knja evac.33 All these facts, added to the differences in style and technique, seem to advocate a division. The fourth period comprises the final aspects of this culture, which are in an especially characteristic way traceable throughout the country. While the sites of the first three periods seem to be equally scattered over the whole of Serbia, the sites of the fourth period appear principally in the Northern Banat and in the neighbouring areas of Hungary, where they are well known 25 M.

The main characteristic of this final stage of develop- ment is a general decline in design and technique, traceable in all spheres of life. Painted wares become extremely rare, while barbotine fabrics again play an important part, and develop new decorative elements, by which they are easily to be told from older wares.35 Of special interest are the plastic human and animal forms, applied to the shoulder of large bowls. Grain- impressions, indented ridges and bosses are also frequent. Everywhere a tendency towards plasticizing the surface can be felt. Some new shapes are added: bowls on several small feet or with cruciform base, large bowls with double handles, which are frequent in Early Danubian Bandkeramik.36 Burnished vases continue to be manufactured, but the firing deteriorates and the black core reappears. Painted and slipped vases occur only very rarely. A real slip is no longer applied; like the black paint, it is of a transparent watery kind. Motives are hardly to be distinguished, and rectilinear designs seem to be most frequent. The chronological position of this period may be recognized from the points it has in common with the Vinia culture and with the older Danubian I Bandkeramik, Bikk culture and the oldest Tisza culture.37 As this question has already been treated in detail in another place, I wish only to observe that, in the levels between 8.60 and 8.oo at Vinia, several important objects of the fourth period of the Starievo culture were found."3 It was in the level from 8.oo to 7"10 that the first imported sherds of the Tisza culture occurred,"39 which confirms the belief that the latest period of the Kdr6s culture is older than the Tisza culture in Hungary. We mention a few details of the remaining repertory. The stone industry is, strange to say, rather scanty and very simple. Blade industry is most frequent. Blade-scrapers, blade-saws and round scrapers were found. At Starievo and on other sites objects of Hungarian obsidian have come to light, though rarely. The appearance of obsidian and of sherds of imported Biikk I vessels in the Serbian Banat 40 shows that relations already existed previously between the Bikk mountains and Northern Serbia. Thus the painted early Bfikk and Sarka fabrics 41 in Hungary and Bohemia receive a natural explanation as collateral wares influenced by the Starievo culture. 34 J.

MILOJCIC Beside the typical 'shoe-last celts' or hoes, there occur numerous hoe-like or adze-like 'flat celts' of trapezoidal form; also a small and degenerate- looking kind of round-bodied axe (Walzenbeil). Bone industry is highly developed; especially frequent are elliptical bone spoons. A speciality are figurines, which are however not so frequent as in the Vinia culture. All figurines have long necks, uptilted breasts and pronounced steatopygy. Eyes are rendered by slanting cuts, and thus look mongoloid. Hair is similarly incised. Also numerous are altars, nearly always with four feet and with sacrificial bowls on a small table. A further feature is the comparative rarity of stamp-seals. The dead were buried in chamber-like grave pits, which may be regarded as collective tombs. The best example is that with nine skeletons from Vinia.42 THE VINaA CULTURE Now let us briefly depict the various periods of the Vinia culture. This is desirable for two reasons: first, to show that the stratigraphy of Vinia is of prime importance for the understanding of the prehistoric chronology of South-Eastern Europe; secondly, because the relations of the culture have often been misunderstood. From M. Vasid's big volumes and his various essays, can be extracted, in spite of his regrettable onesidedness, a firm working foundation, if used thoroughly. There is also material otherwise obtained which completes the picture and makes an exhaustive summary possible. The late F. Holste, using Vasid's evidence, established a division into periods, which on the whole is usable, although it is misleading in the matter of the interrelations between the Vinia and Starievo cultures.43 Our own re- searches of 1938-42 have only completed Holste's work in detail and confirmed the division into periods. Previously, V. G. Childe and O. Menghin divided the Vinia material simply into two groups, an earlier and a later.44 This grouping, so far as it goes, may still be considered valid. For, as we see it, the stratification of the occupied areas of the site is interrupted at a depth of 6.oo metres by a gap. This gap represents a breach of continuity in the occupation of the site, but not in the life of the culture as a whole, which at other sites can easily be traced in an uninterrupted succession of strata from earlier to later (cf. Potporanj, p. 279 below). In order to present these facts conveniently, we have in general left the division of Childe and Menghin unchanged. Their earlier group (' Vinia I') comprises periods A, BI and B2, which are contained in the strata from 9"5 to 6.o metres in depth. These 42 P. Vinia II, 9 ff., pll. 8-27. 43 F.

The later group (' Vinia II') comprises periods C and D, from 6-o0 to 2.50 metres; these represent a specialized, local development of their culture. The earlier Vinia culture appears in Serbia as a completely new one, which, it should be stated, is not autochthonous but introduced from abroad. All the material evidence forms an unbridgeable contrast to the preceding Starievo culture, which in its time was spread all over Serbia, and to a great extent over Western Bulgaria and Serbian Macedonia.46 The Vinia culture was foreign to Serbia; and it is completely wrong to derive from Serbia late neolithic features in Macedonia 47 and the so-called 'Danubian wares' of Thessaly and Greece."4 The Vinia culture cannot have originated anywhere in Europe north of the Balkans. In the North and North-West there was the older Bandkeramik or 'Danubian I' culture of Croatia and Hungary. In the East and North-East there were the pre-Cucuteni and Boian-A cultures. The source of the Vinia culture must be sought in the Aegean area, and its bearers, as we shall see, came from the South. Period A. The first settlers of the VinEa culture founded their settlement at Vinia on the site which the Starievo people had some time previously abandoned. In this period were built, in varying degrees of crudity, rectangular houses with one or two rooms above the surface of the ground, constructed of beams and clay. Numerous pits (bothroi), dug into the natural clay, served as cellars. All of them are comparatively small (diameter 2 to 3 m.) and their sides are almost vertical. The settlement was protected by a ditch, which was several times renewed, but at the level of 7"20 was already abandoned.49 In this period, the dead were buried outside the settlement, as is established by the cemetery near the village of Boto8.50 We have single burials in a contracted position with a small number of objects accompanying them: a bowl or a stone axe, and sometimes ornaments made of fossil spondylus-shells.51 Cremation burials also seem to have occurred.52 Pottery can on the whole be divided into four main groups with several sub-groups: (a) mechanically highly polished ware (' bucchero') (b) ware with lustrous paint (like neolithic Urfirnis) or clay slip (c) burnished ware with incised decoration (d) coarse domestic wares. 45 N.

MILOJCfIA In contrast to Starievo, Vinia pottery is fired to a ringing hardness; when broken, it is seen to be monochrome and usually unslipped. The pottery is mainly dark grey to black and highly polished; the outside and inside have a mechanically produced polish. Sometimes the lower part of a vessel -P~F~bC~:D~hu -r FIG. 3a.-PREHISTORIC CULTURES OF BALKANS, C. 3000 B.C.52a is left unpolished. Single polishing-strokes are still visible at this period. Later technical perfection increases. A brick-red monochrome ware forms a sub-group, but is rare. " A third group is the "black-topped" ware, which goes out of use at the beginning of the next period.54 This class is 52a The map Fig. 3a shows ' Sesklo' as the generic term covering 'Tsani, Tasngli, Chaeronea', etc., given under the headings ' Greece ' and ' Thessaly ' in the table in Fig. I 53 P.

The three groups, especially the first, are characterized by the technique of burnished decorated and rippled designs (Fig. 4- 3, 5, o10-I2), peculiar to the Vinia culture. It need FIG. 3b.-PREHISTORIC CULTURES OF BALKANS, c. 2600 B.C.54a not be stressed that neither fabric nor decorative technique has any pre- decessors in the Danube area, and so the culture must be regarded as alien.

Such pieces are hard to distinguish from the correspond- ing Macedonian and Greek ones of the late neolithic age.55 This fabric, 54 ' Theiss ' on Figs. 3b and c should read ' Tisza'. 55 PMac, 73; E.

The technique of a red-slipped surface is often found in fruit-stands (Fig. 4. 2). In older vases, which still belong to group A, only the foot and the lower part are slipped, the upper part slowly takes on a black colour. FIG. 3C.-PREHISTORIC CULTURES OF BALKANS, C. 2200 B.C. Later, in groups BI and B2, the whole surface is red-slipped.56 A special group is formed by the amphorae, whose shoulders are decorated with dotted ribbons and the rest of the surface well burnished. The decorative motives of Period A comprise angular bands, triangles, horned gables, etc. (Fig. 4- 7, 8). Typical of this period is the asymmetrical style of decoration. Closely 56 P. Vinda II, pl.

MILOJ(IC; connected with the amphorae are the face-lids, which show a versatile system of decoration, advanced even when compared with more recent vases. It is especially characteristic that horns are bevelled in this period (Fig. 4. 9)57 These vessels no doubt served religious purposes. It is not yet sure that they were urns, as Vasia suggested. It is important to note that one of these vessels was found in a house which obviously served a religious purpose."5 A large vessel and some fragments, which bear a human face on their shoulder, must be regarded as belonging to the burnished-ware group.59 The clay used for this ware has an admixture of sand and the surface is treated rather carelessly. Cooking pots and large storage vessels were made from impure clay, but are thoroughly hard-fired. The decoration consists of simple knobs and incisions. These vessels are often spouted. In group A, biconical shapes are typical for all fabrics (Fig. 4. I, 4), though globular shapes were not unknown (Fig. 4. 3, 5). A real neck is still always absent, and fully appears only in the next period. Together with new groups of pottery, new plastic forms appear. Figurines, ritual vessels, altars and other religious objects become more frequent (Fig. 4. 6). In contrast to Starievo figurines, all parts of the body are here modelled schematically. In the main we have female figurines, though male ones also occur. The face is formed by a rounded, tilted triangle; the nose is a small protrusion, the eyes two angular incisions. The head is distinctly detached from the neck, hands are shaped as stretched-away stumps. Breasts and buttocks are only slightly indicated, in contrast to Starievo figurines. Some- times we find a girdle round the waist and a necklace or the border of a shirt incised round the neck. The surface of these figurines was often painted with red, white or black crusted colour, applied after firing.60 This technique seems also to have been used in painting certain vases.61 Besides standing figurines, we have, even so early as this, idols sitting on a pedestal. Numerous zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vases served religious purposes, with a hole on top to pour out liquids. There are three-footed small altars with animals' heads (horse-heads?) and amulets of calcite. Palettes and grinders for grinding ochre colours served for toilet purposes. Bone-spatulas, often mistaken for figurines, were also used for cosmetics. Often simple double and triple finger-rings were made from bone.62 Spear-heads and harpoons with two rows of prongs, typical of the earlier Vinia culture, were made from antlers.63 From fossil spondylus-shell arm-rings, beads and pendants were made. The flint industry is very definitely a blade-industry. Stone 5" P.

Flint arrowheads, with a tang, are rare.64 In the neighbouring mountains cinnabar and galenite seem to have been quarried.65 From the Biikk mountains obsidian was obtained, though not quite as copiously as in the next period. Period B I. Settlement at Vinia seems to have been carried on without interruption, though the earliest settlement was apparently destroyed by fire. The remains of the old settlement were levelled and covered with a layer of clay. A new site (at a depth of about 7"80 m.) was thus obtained, on which the new village was founded. The ditches of the earlier settle- ments, whose level is at a depth approximately between 8.40 and 8.0 m. (house-floors at 8-40) were abandoned and houses were built in their place. Houses were generally built larger and more regularly, but the building technique remained unchanged up to the end of the Vinia period. Still in the same period, this settlement was abandoned, because ofa fire catastrophe, and a new one was founded on the d6bris. Large quantities of clay were brought to the spot to level the ground. The new level lies at about 7.30 m. depth. In this settlement, in one of the houses, which was presumably used for religious purposes, several vases and one large cult-vessel were found among the ruins."6 Hence it can be inferred that the settlement of this period came to a violent end. The contemporary cemeteries are not yet known. Within the settle- ment the dead seem to have been cremated and deposited in urns. During the earlier excavations calcined human bones were found in every stratum, but no clear evidence of cremation-graves could be obtained. In 1934 Vasid apparently obtained two. At a depth of 7.64 was found a pile of ashes about 0o95 m. long, extended in a S.W.-N.E. direction. In the ashes were found remains of a calcined human skull and of other bones.67 Another such grave was found at a depth of 8.5 m. Here a rough pot i.I cm. high was found, containing ashes and calcined bones. The rim and the inside of the vessel were painted with crusted red colour.68 As the same facts were observed by F. Milleker in 1932 in the Potporanj settlement, to be discussed below, in the transition period from B 2 to C,69 it can be taken for granted that, at least from period B I of the Vinia culture onward, cremation of the dead was customary. The kinds of pottery in use continue to be the same and show no momentous difference in the technique of manufacture. Lustrous paint and black-topped 64 D. Karapandiid, loc. cit. 65 V.

The decoration is produced by scraping away the shining surface, so as to make the decorative motives appear dull.v70 The second is a white china-like ware with a red- fired core. Here we have a variety of the slipped wares." The latter is rare, though incrustation painting in white is often found on idols and altars. With regard to decoration, it is significant that on black polished ware ribs are better and more carefully formed (Fig. 5. I, 5). In this period pottery shapes of black bucchero ware show a clearly visible rim. Forms are softer and show a growing clearness in their division into three parts, in contrast to the division into two parts of bowls and pots of group A (Fig. 5. I, 2, 5). Some new shapes are introduced, such as small amphorae with or without upturned lugs (Fig. 5. 3, 9). In the incised ware all angular ribbon-motives are abandoned and meanders appear for the first time (Fig. 5. 6). The red- slipped stemmed goblets follow in their shapes the general tendency to develop necks. The stem gets fuller and the foot itself gets flatter. The whole surface is slipped more and more efficiently. Coarse domestic ware continues to be produced, though a few new specialities are to be registered (Fig. 5. 4, 8, Io). The face-lids of amphorae with incised decoration show a completely symmetrical arrangement of details (Fig. 5. 12). Eyes and coherent orna- ments are formed symmetrically in contrast to the casual asymmetry of older ones. Horns become vertical, but their origin from the horizontal can still be traced. The anthropomorphic vessels also acquire their fully developed shape. The face is fixed to the surface of vases. On the rims of bowls statuettes stand, and the altars, usually three-, more rarely four-footed, become more perfect (Fig. 5. 14). The same developments can be traced in the idols. They are made more carefully, eyes are drawn and the hair is incised. Other details in body and clothing are also indicated. The stone industry and other small-scale products on the whole remain unaltered (Fig. 5. I3). An important fact is the frequency of obsidian, which is connected with the lively trade relations with the Tisza culture of Hungary. These relations receive further evidence in the fragments of imported Tisza ware.72 Period B 2. As mentioned above, the later Vinia settlement of period B I (7.30 m. depth) met its end by violence, as can be inferred from the numerous objects covered by the burnt debris in the house which served a religious purpose. The reconstruction of the settlement took place in the 70 P. Vina II, pl. 117, fig. 249; I1x8, figs. 254-5. 71 Ibid., pl.

Houses show a tendency towards irregularity, though the basic idea of the prolonged rectangle remains untouched.73 The inhabited area lies high above the boundary of the settlement belonging to group A. This settlement apparently was also destroyed by violence, as we can see from the groups of vases found in burnt houses.74 We must, however, be very careful, since the two larger groups contain some vases of a definitely religious character. This will be discussed below. Immediately after the destruction the new settlement was built; its house-floor level appears to be at a depth of 6.0 m. After the destruction of this settlement there seems to be a gap in occupation, witnessed by a poverty or complete absence in period C of these forms which were already flourishing in period B 2. We know, however, several sites in the Serbian Banat, such as Potporanj, near Vrsac, whose material shows a continuous development from period B 2 to C.75 With regard to pottery, period B 2 shows a perfection unattained in the succeeding period. Rippled and polished designs are made with a careful, sure hand (Fig. 6. 2, 8-9). The clay is very well levigated, and approaches that of Greek Minyan vases. In this period the rectilinear system of rippled decoration is abandoned. At the same time the potters ceased to decorate only the shoulders of vases. Thus the interior of bowls is often decorated with arc or spiral motives.76 The cherry-red polished wares reach their climax in this period. Slipped ware is limited to stemmed bowls (Fig. 6. 9). New are simple painted stripe-ornaments, radiating from the rim."7 These are in a diluted colour applied before firing. Likewise new is the use of black lustrous paint. This technique is rare.7" Towards the end of this period the ribbon-ornaments incised on amphorae and face-lids show a preference for lines of dots made with a cog-wheel or comb stamp, but this technique reaches its climax only during the next period. When the ribbons are made freehand as before, they are characteristically filled with dots in line likewise. This kind of decoration is now applied to other vases as well. It is significant that the spiral occurs for the first time in this technique (Fig. 6. I o). As regards the development of shapes, the triple division now reaches its climax and the individual parts begin to be formed independently in accordance with the decoration. Thus the rims of bowls are often concave in section, shoulders of pots are rounded or, in the case of vases with two members, concave (Fig. 6. 1-2, 5, 7). Small biconical amphorae now occur rather frequently, 3 P. Vinla II, pl. 58, fig. 21o. 74 P. VinCa IV, 36 f. (v 7"05); 38 ff. (7 66); 43 f. (V 65). 75 F. Milleker, Starinar XIII (3938), xx6 ft. 76 P.

Bottle-like vases, flat dishes, bellied amphorae (Fig. 6. 6) and flat plate-like lids are innovations (Fig. 6. io). All of them bear an incised double spiral. Coarse domestic ware for the most part remains unchanged, but the shapes become a little flatter. Beside beaked jugs (Fig. 6. 3) we now often have ones with tubular spout (Fig. 6. 4). The individual parts of slipped stemmed bowls show a tendency--as with black polished bowls-to develop independently. The stem is solid, the foot-disk is flat and is regarded as an independent part of the vase (Fig. 6. 9). Beside these well made slipped specimens, worse pieces also occur, which may be considered of local manufacture. The face lids of amphorae show no essential change. The horns, however, have become completely vertical, and there is no sign of a previous horizontal position (Fig. 6. 6). To this period belong the groups of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases, which now reach their technical climax. I mention a vase representing a human figure found in a house at 6.6 m. depth, a double- faced vase from the same place, a fragment of an anthropomorphic vase from 6*3 m., and a horned animal vase from 6 I m.79 Many fragments of such vases belong to this group, as also the 'Hyde Vase', though it was found at a depth of 7.05 m.80 The latter vase was found among a group whose forms belong mainly to period B 2. In idols the same tendency can be noted as with all other pottery. Quality continues to improve, but a schematic conception remains dominant. Some examples, which are perhaps imports, are especially well formed and made of'Minyan' clay. The eyes are modelled plastically, the face has a pentagonal form and looks like a mask fixed to a real face. The back of the head is often vertically perforated, as occurs also with arm-stumps. Unperforated examples have incised hair. Altars are unchanged. New are idols with modelled hands resting on the stomach. No cemeteries belonging to this period were found, but in the Potporanj settlement an urn-grave came to light. As, however, the settle- ment was founded in period B 2 and lasted into period C, there is no evidence that the graves belong to period B 2.sl The stone industry on the whole remains unchanged. New are the celt-like hammers with a bored hole. There is much obsidian. We have reached the time of far-reaching trade relations. Period C in Vinia comprises the levels from 5.80 m. to 4'50 m. depth. In Vinia there seems to have been an interval between the last settlement of period B 2 (at 6 m.) and the first one of period C at a depth of 5.4O m. This cannot be proved as a matter simply of stratification, because apparently 79 P. Vinda I, 43, fig. 89; 53, fig. I05; pl. 23, fig. 103; 66, fig. I13; pl. 26, fig.

Milleker, Starinar XIII (1938), x8 ff.</page><page sequence="22">THE PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION OF SERBIA 279 there is no sterile level between, but I agree with F. Holste, who aptly put it: " Die Entwicklung verlauft freilich nicht geradlinig, obwohl man tiberall bemerkt, dass die kleinen Randbildungen und weitausladenden Schultern (of the vases) der Stufe B den Ausgangspunkt bilden ".82 This slight inter- ruption is traceable everywhere, and as we have a continuous development at Potporanj and other sites, this more distinct contrast between the two stages means in no way that something essentially new has been acquired. On the whole the development carries on continuously. Nothing has yet been published about the building of houses, though up to 1942 plans were preserved. One settlement-level seems to lie at a depth of 5'40 m. and another at 4"80 m. In pottery blackish-grey fabrics with rippled and polished decoration continue to be dominant. It is important that vases took a brick-red hue if they were exposed to a subsequent firing. The rippled designs are now made more distinctly, so that we can by now speak of fluted ware. Curvi- linear designs occur more frequently (Fig. 7. I, 6-7, II).83 Polished decora- tion is better and more systematically made. The red polished and red- slipped varieties of stemmed bowls are still to be observed, but they get more and more rare and towards the end of this period they disappear completely. The same happens to incised amphorae and face-lids, which have gone out of use by 4'5 m. depth. The incised decoration of vase is however not abandoned, but is transferred to other types of pottery. Ribbons are filled with comb or cog-wheel punctuations (Fig. 7. 14). Dimples were filled with incrustation matter. This decorative technique is especially characteristic for this period.84 Moreover the occurrence of " repetition motives ", con- sisting of spirals and meanders, is typical. The necks of wide-mouthed vessels show a tendency to splay out to a funnel-like form (Fig. 7. I, 5). In other cases, shoulders are concave (Fig. 7. 9). Everywhere a tendency towards S-profiles can be traced. Bottle-like vases still occur (Fig. 7. I1). The small biconical shoulder-amphorae reach their highest perfection.85 Spouted vases are frequently found too (Fig. 7. 8). As regards coarse ware, besides flat dishes, the appearance of wide-mouthed storage vessels and amphorae (Fig. 7. 7) is important.86 A biconical coarse storage vessel was used for a cremation burial at Potporanj. The old biconical cooking pots are, in a flatter form, produced without change. As already mentioned, face-lids become very rare, and the old, widely adopted form is abandoned. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases still 82 F. Holste, WPZ XXVI (939), 4. 83 P. Vinda II, pl. 65, fig. 232; IV, 54, fig. 73; 98, fig. 158. 84 Ibid., pl. 67, figs. 23I-4; pl. 68, figs. 235-7. ** P.

MILOJ(IJ occur.87 Of idols it is typical that the feet are always replaced by a pedestal (or a long skirt?), which is often separated from the body of the figurine by an incised stroke. Idols with hands resting on the stomach are frequent. Eyes are modelled plastically and are surrounded by incised lines. Crusted painting in white or red is, as before, often practised. Clothes are some- times indicated by incised lines on the body. Simple types, whose head is not perforated, always have incised hair. In this period sitting idols and groups of mother and child appear for the first time, though some of these seem to belong still to period B 2. Here should be mentioned some marble idols, which belong either to period C or to B 2.88 The stone industry remains unchanged, though shoe-last celts pre- dominate. Perforated axe-hammers occur frequently. For this period a sufficient quantity of copper, used for the manufacture of flat axes and axe- hammers, is reliably attested.89 Obsidian becomes very rare and in the next period no longer occurs. Period D comprises the levels between 4"5 m. and 2"5 m. depth, with two habitation levels at about 4. 1o and 34o0 m. A complete plan of the excavated houses has not yet been published. Beside rectilinear houses, the first curvi- linear ones occur, it appears, at a depth of 4"Io; according to the published pictures, they are certainly attested at a level of 3.4o.90 We have houses with several rooms which had an apse-like room built close to a rectangular main room. In the houses horseshoe-shaped ovens were found, and M. Vasid believes that the houses were factories, presumably for the working of cin- nabar. Such ovens had been used since the foundation of the settlement, as can be seen from the piece found at 8.20 m.91 The pottery industry of this time is best represented by the two great groups of vases found at a depth of 4- I and 3"48 m. respectively.92 Black polished ware with polished and fluted decoration continues to be the most frequent ware. Though vases of both groups are brick-red to-day, this colour is due to a subsequent fire to which the vase was exposed. The cross is frequently used as a motive of polished decoration inside bowls. In rare cases floral motives are used instead."9 The fluted decoration grows broader, so that it gives the effect of ribbing. Curvilinear patterns are in use (Fig. 8. 8, Io). The slipped stemmed bowls and cherry-red ware no longer occur. Stamped ware with repetition motives becomes very rare, but the red and white "crusted ware" grows in importance (Fig. 8. 12), reaching its climax 87 P. Vinca I, pl. 27, figs. I I5-8. 88 P.

Amphorae with face-lids are no longer found, but the technique of incised design is still practised. In bowls, necks and shoulders grow to an unprecedented size, so that for a time real funnel-bowls develop. Towards the end of this period shapes flatten, and bowls approach once again their original form without neck (Fig. 8. I, 4-5, 7, I o). The small amphorae still have the same form as in the last period, though the shoulders are slightly more rounded. Spouted pots occur as before, but their profile also flattens (Fig. 8. 2). Besides flat dishes (Fig. 8. 9) and wide-mouthed storage vessels (Fig. 8. 6) we have now big three-handled amphorae.95 Crater-like pots are new; they are four-handled. New also are box-shaped basins (Fig. 8. I1 I), tripods (Fig. 8. 8), though these seem to have existed even earlier, and clay funnels (Fig. 8. 3).96 The heads and bodies of figurines are now embellished all over with ornamental lines; ears and cheeks are perforated. They are richly painted with crusted red colour. Towards the end of the period, they are rather badly manufactured and look almost board-like. Kourotrophoi still occur in this period. Zoomorphic vases also still occur, but are rare.97 In the stone industry, we note a great falling off of obsidian. Perforated axe-hammers are usual, and 'shoe-last celts' and trapezoidal stone axes continue in use. In this period the Vinia culture comes to its end, though there are still two occupation-levels at 2.30 and 1i60 m. depth. These two last levels Holste assigned to a period E.98 The older level is largely influenced by the Baden culture, and the younger one seems to belong to the Kostolac culture, which the present writer has defined elsewhere.99 As these two cultures have nothing to do with the real Vinia culture and, according to their material, belong mainly to Central Europe, we need not here pursue further the developments in Northern Serbia. THE BUBANJ CULTURE OF CENTRAL SERBIA In Central Serbia developments went another way. There the later stages of the Vinia culture, namely periods C and D, never developed. Towards the end of B 2, which is well developed at Gradac, Setka, Zupska and Ploinik,100 development is cut off. A new culture is formed, which we have called the Bubani culture.101 On the site of Bubani the strata of 96 P. Vina IV, pl. 40, fig. Iooa, b; pl. 6i, figs.

As the publication of this site was made in a world language and is commonly available, we believe it will be enough to add only a summary sketch here.102 Clear house-plans from this culture could not be obtained, but we appear to have rectangular houses with clay walls reinforced by posts, and trodden floors. We have also pits for utilitarian purposes (bothroi). We know nothing about the mode of burial. Pottery is mainly fired brownish-grey or black. Besides fluted decoration (Fig. 10. 5), we have on larger vases a technique which combines polished and painted designs in white and red, painted either before or after firing. The main motive consists of two Cte Vinoa (Star.evoy Jco, Butmir Bubanj Vrtiste Vuredol Borto Aradac Tordo, IPoporanj Gradac Ploinik Sarval IV A Coriod L~) t Age Bronze Middle Brooze m mni a. a_,m FIG. 9.-SYNCHRONISTIC TABLE OF SERBIAN SITES. spirals, painted one on each side of the bowl.lUm Besides bowls with an exaggerated lip (Fig. Io. i), one-handled jugs often with cut-away mouth (Fig. io. 14), cups and bowls are typical (Fig. 10. 4). We have also two- handled vases (Fig. Io. 5, 7, I3) and amphorae (Fig. Io. Io) with vertical lugs (Fig. Io. 9), jugs with spouts (Fig. 10. 12) and bellied vases, stand-rings and concave lids with handles in the hollowed top (Fig. Io. 3). Finally we have large pear-shaped amphorae with two or three handles and with plastic crescents on the shoulder (Fig. IO0. 2). The flint industry is a blade industry; we have also stone axes. The bone industry is well developed. Besides the usual things, spoons and needles are carved.104 Copper is known. That this culture was contemporary with Vinia C and D is demonstrated 102 A.

This question has been treated in detail elsewhere,105 and so we only note here that at Ploinik and Gradac the forms of the Bubanj culture appear intermingled with those of the Vinta culture.1'06 Moreover the typical Vinia idol of period C was found at Bubanj at a depth of I180 mn.107 Further, the two cultures show many common points which add weight to the facts set out here. In order to clarify the chronological relations of the main sites in Serbia, we add a chart (Fig. 9), whose explanation we have given elsewhere.'8s EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF SERBIAN NEOLITHIC CULTURES Having given a summary of the developments and relative chronological position of the late neolithic cultures from the earliest beginnings yet known until I9oo B.c.-the Baden culture is contemporary with the Middle Helladic culture in Greece l09--we can proceed to the treatment of our real theme. Two points must be considered: first, the individual features of the culture; secondly, outside influences alien to the real culture, which are either taken over by natives or remain as unassimilated imports. Thus we must examine two topics: first, the different cultures themselves according to their origin, and secondly according to elements coming from abroad by way of imports or spiritual influences. In order to recognize the origin of a culture we must not of course indiscriminately apply all objects from all periods and groups, but must use primarily the finds from the earliest period, and only secondarily later objects as a confirmation of results already obtained. Imports and alien influences in general are rather of a chronological importance, and are of only secondary value in tracing the history of culture. This value they acquire only if a subsequent effect can be proved, and if they have provoked a change in the local form. Search for the origin of the Starievo culture has up to now seemed rather hopeless, as this culture is only newly discovered and the finds are scanty. Some facts, however, should be pointed out. The oldest barbotine ware with its designs produced by nail-impressions, pinching, incised lines, rough grooves and so on (Fig. 2. I-3, 7) 10 does not appear to be isolated. It is foreign to the main areas of Danubian I Bandkeramik, Bohemia and Southern Germany, though some Hungarian sites of this culture have produced similar pieces."' These, however, are the areas where the two cultures meet, and these features and also the appearance of painted pottery in the early Biukk 10 V. Milojkid, Chronologie der jingeren Steinzeit. o106 M.

MILQJCII culture in Hungary 112 and in the later Danubian Bandkeramik of Bohemia 113 only go to prove that the two cultures are contemporary. Barbotine ware is lacking in the area of the Cucuteni-Tripolje culture, while the 'pre- Cucuteni' culture has quite another character. This is true also of the area of the lower Danube, where the Boian-A culture was dominant at this time. In the south the situation is entirely different. Pottery of this kind was found at the village of Servia in Macedonia in the oldest stratum, together with painted ware of the Thessalian type contemporary with Sesklo.114 Farther south, in Thessaly, what we have called the 'pre-Sesklo' culture has produced related objects, though this class is a little different and seems to have lost its influence in the time of the Sesklo culture.115 In South- eastern regions, we find this ware at some sites in Bulgaria, around Sofia, together with painted pottery related to our painted Starievo ware.116 Farther south this sort of pottery came to light on a site Banja near Karlovo in Suva Planina, again together with painted pottery.117 This ware was widespread in Western Bulgaria also. Examples are the vases from Deve- Bargan near Trnovo-Seimen, Tell Meakur, where a painted vase occurs, and the cave of Morovica near Teteven.118s In the West similar material has been found in Leukas 119 and in Southern Italy.120 In every case, the barbotine ware occurred in company with painted ware. Here affinities are still clearly visible, but if we go farther they get blurred and we have only loose connections, which lead rather to other types of these regions than to the groups typical of Serbia. Thus O. Menghin had already connected the punch-dotted group of Thessaly with the Molfetta pottery, and the latter again with the African Redeyef ware.121 In the other direction, such con- nections exist also with Mersin in Southern Asia Minor and with Syria.122 These relations cannot yet be explained. It is however certain that this kind of pottery, though of varying age in different regions, forms a basis on which alone the painted varieties could subsequently originate. It seems possible that we have here a Mesolithic tradition, spread over all of these regions, and formed on an Upper Palaeolithic basis, which one could expect to be Aurignacian. 112 F.

MILOJOIW Connections of the more recent Starievo periods with the South are so numerous and varied, though there is no evidence of imports, that we are compelled to divide the material into groups. In the first place we shall treat pottery shapes, secondly decoration, thirdly religious objects, fourthly burial rites, and finally the miscellaneous material. Among shapes, no doubt the hemispherical bowl is the simplest form that occurs in the Starievo culture (Fig. 2. 14). In general this is a very common form, but in the area of the Vinia culture it is unknown. In Northern Serbia it is frequent in Danubian Bandkeramik settlements 124 and it is well known in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece.125 In the same regions we have the related form of hemispherical bowl with flat bottom, but the hemispherical bowl with solid flat foot-stand (Fig. 2. I8) 126 does not occur farther north. The hemispherical goblet with a ring-stem (Fig. 2. 15) 127 is a form which occurs only south of Serbia and is especially characteristic of the Sesklo culture.128 Another typical form is the globular amphora with slightly detached foot 129 or ring- stem (Fig. 2. 17, I9).130 These forms are lacking in the adjacent northern regions, and occur only in the south.la3 To this group also belong more or less globular storage vessels with detached neck (Fig. 2. 16), which also occur in the south.132 Further features are the vertically bored lugs (Fig. 2. I7), which are found for the first time in Starievo II, and ribbon handles (Fig. 2. 12), which apparently begin during period II or III. It is significant that both kinds of handles have gone out of use by the time of the early Vinia culture. Ribbon handles remained completely unknown in the Northern regions at this time, and lugs, which are found for the first time in Starievo II, are only later taken over. In Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece, however, they are equally frequent.la33 In Italy also they are not unknown on pots.134 If we turn from pottery shapes, which represent only various transforma- tions of the globular form, to the painted decoration, we shall again find strong relations with the South. Pleasure in bright designs with interplay of colours is unknown to Central Europe. There we have only severe, deeply 123 Fewkes, Goldman, Ehrich, BASPR IX (2933), pl. 8, fig. 8. 124 F.

The Starievo culture, however, shows during the period of its climax a wonderfully coherent association of a lively coloured background with colourful designs which seem inexhaustible in their com- binations. This is especially true of the third period. In this respect the Starievo culture cannot be separated from Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece. Judged by its conception of decoration, the Starievo culture is a sister of the cultures of the Southern Balkans, and nothing is more confusing than an attempt to connect it with the Central European Bandkeramik because of the presence of spiral motives, as has been done with the Dimini and Cucuteni cultures. A decorative motive, which can well be transferred, does not prove the genetic derivation of one culture from another. If this reasoning is applied in other cases, the result will be nonsense. According to this theory, the northern Bronze Age must have been created by the Danubians, and the numerous spiral motives of Mesopotamian seals and of Egyptian reliefs must be derived from the potters of the Bandkeramik. These and other such inferences will be total misconceptions. Therefore we emphatically refuse to acknowledge a connection between Bandkeramik on one side and the Starievo-Dimini-Cucuteni culture on the other. The Boian-A culture is likewise not connected with Bandkeramik nor with the Starievo culture.l35 All these cultures are entirely different and the sole connection is given by their type of social and economic life, by the fact that they are contemporary, and by a decorative motive, which was by no means always a native element in these cultures. At least in the sphere of painted pottery in the Balkans the spiral motive was a secondary feature. If we now consider the painted ware from a technical point of view, we shall notice that during the second and third period the monochrome, red- slipped variety is of the greatest importance. Technically this ware is hard to tell from AI ware in Thessaly, Greece and Macedonia.a36 In the second period there is a red-slipped, white-painted variety corresponding to A3a ware of Thessaly 137 and, particularly in the regions of Bulgaria round Sofia and Karlovo, there is also a white-slipped, red painted ware.a138 This last variety corresponds in technique to the Thessalian A3p ware.a139 We have also a red-slipped variety with dark brown, almost black, painted decoration. This also has its Thessalian counterpart in the Sesklo period.140 A fourth 135 J. Nestor, BRGK XXII (I932), 54 if.; D. Rosetti, Sapaturile dela Vidra, Publ. Muz. Munidcip.

MILOJOII variety is a rare black-slipped ware, known to us from the Sesklo period in Thessaly as A5a,141 which is often erroneously considered the ancestor of the later black-polished, monochrome Fia.142 In the third period red- slipped ware with black, curvi-spiraliform patterns, corresponding to B3cx in Thessaly, is most important.143 Polychrome painting also now occurs on the red-slipped ware B3p in Thessaly 144 and also a light yellow ware without slip with dark paint (B3E) and polychrome (B33).145 Finally there is a dark brown variety, whose colour seems due to a wash of lustrous paint.146 From all these instances it may be seen that painted Starievo vases differ only slightly from Thessalian ware, but that there is no complete identity. If we now try to analyse the motives, we shall find many details similar to Bulgarian, Macedonian, Thessalian and Greek motives. The conception however is different in all regions. Each area combines the details in its particular way. The simplest motive is vibrating radial lines (Fig. 2. 4, 6); pieces with this decoration were found at Magula near Pyrgos in Boeotia.147 The most frequent motives are cross-hatched triangles and rectangles (Fig. 2. 5, 8-9). These also appear in Macedonia and Greece.148 A characteristic feature is bands composed of thin parallel lines bordered by thick lines (Fig. 2. Io). Such bands, though differently arranged, are also typical of the later period of the Sesklo culture in Greece.149 The chequer pattern also appears in both Greece and Serbia.150 If we try to analyse the motives of the third period, we cannot find a single direct connection with Thessalian patterns, though there are plenty of curvilinear and spiraliform patterns in this group. 'Repeating' patterns and the meander are typical in Thessaly, though there is doubtless some common tendency in the liveliness and variety of patterns. In Macedonia, however, we find closer parallels, though they occur later. Painted ware from Olynthus especially nearly approaches our Starievo ware, and close connections appear to exist here.151 It should be mentioned that none of the settlements corresponding to our Starievo III and the early Dimini period have been found in Macedonia, though they existed, as proved by the excavations at Polystylo.152 Thus the lack of parallels in the south is due merely to our defective knowledge of the Southern Balkans. Here we must turn to the finds already referred to at Banja near Karlovo, where there are vases of the Starievo II-Sesklo type, with white-on-red and red-on-yellow a41 PT, 15. 142 Kunze, Orchomenos II, 9 it.; K.

Thus it is possible that the curvi- linear motives originate in the Eastern region of the area of painted pottery in the Western Balkans (influenced by Boian-A culture?) and that from that region they were brought to the West peacefully or by migration. If we now turn to religious objects, we find that clay idols play the most important part. In comparison with the thousands of figurines in the Vinia- Gumelnitza culture, idols are rare in the Starievo culture. Therefore we shall here use Hungarian pieces also as evidence, in order to supplement the material.154 We have exclusively female figurines with pronounced steato- pygy and breasts, long necks and undivided heads, from which hooked noses protrude. Eyes are expressed by slanting cuts and thus " look Chinese ". Mouths also are sometimes indicated. Almost in every case long hair has been drawn with long strokes. In the older Danubian and Boian-A culture idols seem to have been unknown,155 but in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece down to the Peloponnese we find close parallels in the older local culture of the Sesklo period.'"56 Other figures are cattle, or rather goats, which again are found in Greece and Thessaly.157 Not to be separated from religious objects are vases with reliefs 158 of either women with heavily stressed vulva or he-goats, which are closely connected with the female figures if they appear on the same vase. Of such reliefs, only one piece is known to me from Macedonia and Greece. It is interesting that they are found together with closely corresponding idols in the sphere of the Tell Halaf culture,159 where, as we have seen, the barbotine ware also has excellent parallels outside Europe. These parallels are doubtless suggestive of a connection, though there is no evidence of any other relation between Western Asia and the Balkans at this time. Further, we have four-footed altars in contrast to the three-footed ones of the Vinia culture, which also have their Greek and 153 Unpublished material in Museum of Plovdiv. 154 Starievo figurines from Serbia: P.

MILOJO1IC Thessalian counterparts.160 Finally the numerous stamp-seals should be mentioned, though it is not quite clear what they were used for.161 For the Starievo-Kdrds culture multiple interments seems to be typical. At Vinia, a 'chamber-tomb with dromos ' was found, in which nine corpses were buried.162 In Hungary four skeletons and in another case three skeletons were found in one grave.163 Often single skeletons were found, mainly in refuse-pits. Similar cases are found in Greece, where we have the first type in the artificial cave-tomb of Prosymna 164 and the second type in all other instances.165 In both cases there seem to have been no objects added, if the potsherds are rightly not to be regarded as such. Among the miscellaneous finds I should like to mention the bone spoons, which occur from Hungary down to Thessaly.166 The flint industry on the whole is related to a tradition of Aurignacian forms, in contrast to that of the Danubian I culture, for which L. Zotz has suggested a similar relationship to Magdalenian.167 Moreover it should be mentioned that in the Starievo culture shoe-last celts with convex back are rare, and play no important part. Far more frequent are triangular celts with asymmetrically sloped back, and trapezoids with high backs (and the edges rounded off), which have often been mistaken for shoe-last celts. If we now turn again to the Vinia culture we shall see that everything points to the south.168 As the material remains of the VinEa culture are more abundant than those of the Starievo culture, we can deal with them under the same headings, and proceed to treat the pottery shapes. Like those of the Starievo culture, the pottery shapes of the Vinia culture owe nothing to Central European forms. Similarly they are completely independent of the preceding Starievo culture. They thus represent a new repertory of shapes introduced from abroad, and as a matter of fact all shapes of the Vinia culture have their exact counterparts in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece. The pottery of the oldest period, A, of the Vinia culture is divided between a biconical form (Fig. 4. I, 4) and one with rounded outlines (Fig. 4- 3, 5). These basic forms we find in Macedonia,169 but in Thessaly there seems to be a tendency towards more angular shapes.'x7 To avoid naming a boundless variety of corresponding shapes I should like to mention only some of the more typical examples, and cannot set out to exhaust all the 16o PT, 27, fig. 5; 89, fig. 42 d; 2o7, fig. 57 g. 1x6 J.

Typical of Vinia A are biconical, wide-mouthed bowls with scarcely indicated rim (Fig. 4. I, 4). These reappear frequently in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece."11 The same is true of the biconical pots with slightly incurved shoulders (Fig. 6. 7; 7. 9)"172 An especially conspicuous form is the wide-mouthed bowl with reinforced shoulder and cylindrical neck-rim (Fig. 6. 2).173 In the same group belong bellied pots with cylindrical necks.17"'4 Wide-mouthed funnel-bowls with thick shoulders and splayed funnel-rim appear in Vinia and Thessaly (Fig. 7. 5).175 There are also fruit-stands (Fig. 4. 2),176 tripod-vases (Fig. 8. 8) 177 and biconical cooking-pots with ledge-like lugs (Fig. 5. 8, Io).178 These are almost all the forms we have among the more elaborate Vinia ware. There remain the amphorae with face-lids (Fig. 6. 6) and large storage vessels with faces on the neck. These we shall treat more carefully in conjunction with religious objects. If we now turn to decorative technique, we must stress first that at this time there is to be observed a general decline in decoration. Colours are replaced by a greyish-black, impersonal dullness. The bearers of the Vinia culture do not delight in gay colours, on the contrary there is a tendency to avoid them wherever possible. Colour is used only for painting idols, altars and vases which were not in daily use. In every line there can be observed an attitude towards colour which was unknown in the Starievo culture. It seems doubtful whether this can be explained as due simply to the develop- ment of metal vases, though this factor certainly played a large part in the disappearance of painted decoration in general.179" The intention to make the surface of the vase shine by polishing must also be regarded as in some sense decorative. The technique of firing the surface black or red is utterly unknown in Central Europe. (The occurrence of this technique in the painted pottery of Moravia shows, together with other facts, that it is peculiar to the movement which also created the Vinia culture).

Schmidt in his excavations in the lowest strata of Bapska and SarvaS,186 which are contemporary with Vinia A-B I. Connected with the technique just mentioned is that of polished decoration found in Macedonia, Thessaly, Greece, the Islands, Asia Minor and Syria.187 In the latter country it is especially old, from which we can infer the direction from which it came to Serbia.18s On black-polished vases, the polished decoration is often enhanced by rippled and ribbed patterns. This also has been found only in the South.'89 The technique of crusted painting (after firing) with red, white, yellow or black was practised, though rarely, from the earliest times. This technique is not native in Central Europe either; it is, however, used in Macedonia, Thessaly, Greece and the Islands.'9o Finally, the technique of black-topped ware should be mentioned. It has a distinctively southern origin.191 If the connections already quoted were not sufficient to prove that the Vinia culture is the product of South-eastern influences, the cult-objects would be complete proof. Not a Single feature of this religious world has its foundation in Central Europe. The frequent occurrence of idols, whose use is not yet completely clear, implies a new type whose special feature is a strong systematization. Characteristic of these figures are a clearly detached triangular face, back-tilted head and angularly incised eyes. This type is found in Macedonia, and more frequently in Thessaly and Thermi.192 Here a new tendency is represented, which has little to do with the naturalism of the sphere of painted pottery, and obviously results from an entirely different attitude towards the deity. To me it seems as if the gods of the Starievo culture owe their natural shape to direct imagination, while the figures made by the Vinia people are only symbols of deities seen in a trance, that is to say in a not natural state. In some way this kind of idol must be connected also with the numerous anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases at Vinia and in the related Gumelnitza culture. It need hardly be stressed that the region where these vases originated and spread is the South-East, and is remote from contact with Danubian I culture. Thus we find such vases in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece, and especially closely corresponding s184 W. Lamb, PZ XXIII (1932), 124 ff., figs. I3-4. 185 PMac, 73; Holmberg, Asea, 42f. 186 R. R.

Likewise the curious three-footed altars (Fig. 5. 14) with incised patterns and crusted painting often occur in the Southern Balkans.196 Vases with faces and amphorae with face-lids will be spoken of only briefly here as we intend to treat the whole of this subject in detail elsewhere. There is no evidence for precise parallels, but connections with other objects no doubt exist, though the amphorae them- selves are of a different kind from those found at Troy.197 Trojan vases have turned-up arm-stumps, which closely resemble the small Vinia amphorae with turned-up handles.198 Vasid at first connected these vases with the lids,199 but excavation has shown that the lids belong to amphorae with incised decoration.200 On the other hand a similar find from Crete (Hagios Nikolaos) supports the reconstruction suggested by Vasid.201 Amphorae with incised decoration were also found in the settlement on the Protesilaos mound.202 We can say nothing about burial rites, as the cemeteries of this time in Macedonia, Thessaly, Greece and Western Asia Minor are unknown to us. Likewise I shall not give a detailed report on the other objects from the Vinia culture, as they can in no way cast new light on the results already gained; they would only add to the evidence of connections. Two groups of objects should however be mentioned: the marble figurines 203 and marble palettes.204 The white marble of which they are made proves that they were imported. The process of manufacture cannot be clearly recognized, but the objects must have come from the South. The rectangular form of certain palettes suggests a connection with areas connected with the Cyclades (or Southern Bulgaria ?).205 'es PT, 69; 147 f.f, fig. 91b; J.

MILOJCSIU If we turn now to the third of the groups of neolithic cultures in Serbia we must observe that the Bubanj culture is closely related to cultures in Western Bulgaria and South-western Rumania: the Gnilane culture in Bulgaria and the Salcutza culture in Rumania.206 In reality these cultures already belong, from an Aegean point of view, to the Early Bronze Age and to the group which comprises Early Helladic, Early Macedonian, Early Troadic and Early Minoan. From a Central European point of view, however, these cultures in the Northern Balkans still belong to the latest Stone Age. All of them are earlier than the Baden culture and the con- temporary groups of the Northern Megalithic-civilization. It follows, by an irritating anomaly of nomenclature, that these are at one time assigned to the Neolithic Age, at another to the Age of Metals. The terminology depends on the author; if he looks at these cultures from Central Europe, they are Neolithic, if he looks from the Aegean area, they belong to the Early Bronze Age. One single glance at the shapes of this culture should be sufficient to prove its Aegean character. Thus askoi are frequent in the Bubanj-Gnilane- Salcutza cultures; 207 in the Early Macedonian and Helladic cultures they are of paramount importance. Plastic crescents occur on an askos from Vinia, as also on a sherd of an askos-jug and on the famous Hyde vase,20s and also on amphorae at Bubanj (Fig. 10. 2),209 and there are others in Thessaly, Thermi and Troy.210 The chronological position of such vases is assured as Early Bronze Age by the occurrence of these ornaments on the askos and the askos-jug from Vinia. The small stemmed vase with vertical lug (Fig. i o. 9) is an exact imitation of the identical vases from Thermi and Troy.211 The same is true of the spouted pot (Fig. 10. 12).212 More- over we have jugs with sloping neck (Fig. I o. i4); this is, with askoi and sauce-boats, a basic form of the Aegean culture in the Early Bronze Age. Two-handled sauce-boats also occur (Fig. 10. 8), and are closely related with the corresponding Trojan gold vessels.213 Besides these main types we have many common shapes such as two-handled bowls and pots (Fig. 10o. 5-7, I3),214 amphorae (Fig. Io. Io),215 one-handled jugs and pots (Fig. Io. 206 N. Petkov, Godilnik (Annuaire) Muz. Sofia V (1926-31I), I 15 if ; D. Berciu, Archeologia Preistorica a Olteniei (Craiova, 1939), 49-72; J. H.

I),217 concave lids with handles in the hollow top (Fig. io. 3).218 All of these shapes are possible only in virtue of the Aegean development, as shown by the above mentioned relations. In the Central Europe of this period they would be impossible. These few but important examples may suffice to show the origin of the Bubanj-Gnilane-Salcutza cultures. We must not forget, however, that native elements also played a part, as may be seen from the painted and spiraliform patterns. With regard to religion, it must be noted that this culture shows exactly the same disinclination to form idols as the Macedonian and Helladic cultures in the South. The only figurine found at Bubanj was imported from the area where the late Vinia culture was at its highest stage.219 Compared with the Vinia culture, all other plastic objects also appear to be rare. We know nothing about burials, but we assume that they were located outside the settlements, as always during this period. Among miscellaneous finds, axes should be mentioned; they likewise appear for the first time in this cultural movement in the South.220 We have also clay spindle-whorls, which are often ornamented.221 These objects are unknown in the older Vinia culture. SUMMARY It can now be clearly seen that the Serbian regions were in their develop- ment in the latest Stone Age closely connected with Macedonia and Greece culturally and ethnically. Moreover Serbia seems indirectly connected with South-western Asia. One might say that the Serbian regions were but a province of the great Hither-Asiatic cultural community. It is not yet clear if the bearers of the pre-Sesklo-Starievo I culture were newcomers from another region, or if the interrelations spring from a common origin. We must not forget that in the Balkans (as in South-western Asia) the Aurignacian culture seems to have lasted throughout the later stages of the Upper Palaeolithic Age,222 and may be supposed to have engendered a Mesolithic tradition. Equally obscure is the source of painting on vases and of the Hither-Asiatic religious ideology; should we attribute it to migration, transplantation, or rather to an independent development from a common basis? In Serbia no objects have been found which might be identified as imports from Greece, to say nothing of Hither-Asia; parallels however are so exact that a close connection cannot be doubted. 216 M.

MILOJ(It When treating of the black-polished ware of type A at Vinia, we spoke often of the Danubian invaders or Danubian influences 223 that have been recognized in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece. In opposition to this view, it must be stressed that the Vinia A culture is not based on any preparative development in Serbia. As such preparative developments are also lacking in Central Europe, it is completely wrong to include parallels with Vinea among any 'Danubian elements' that may be claimed as appearing in Macedonia, Thessaly and Greece. The bearers of the Vinia culture must have come to Serbia from the South. They must have penetrated the Serbian-Slavonian and Thessalian-Greek areas simultaneously, as is shown by pottery shapes.224 Decorative elements of this earliest Vinia period we find in the more recent late neolithic stratum of Servia (Macedonia).225 At Vinia, however, all the main types of the earlier period in Servia are missing. Hence it may be inferred that the users of black-polished ware settled in Macedonia earlier than in Serbia. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that fragments of burnished decorated and rippled ware were found in Dimini strata in Thessaly.226 Since nothing is known for certain about the culture which existed in Asia Minor before Troy I, and since it is very possible that here, as also on the Islands of the Aegean, there was a culture of the Vinia type, we are inclined to believe that the Vinia culture originated in Asia Minor.227 Further treatment of the Bubanj-Gnilane-Salcutza culture is un- necessary. This culture is so closely linked with the Macedonian develop- ments of the Early Bronze Age that Heurtley's observations on the origin of Macedonian forms apply equally to our culture.228 It is a matter of course that these South-eastern influences did not come to a halt in Serbia, but spread to Central Europe as well. At the time of the Starievo culture the borders run to the West of Osijek (Esseg) on the Drave and to the North of the K6ros river on the Tisza.229 So far settlements of the Starievo culture had spread. This boundary was, however, penetrated by certain influences, as shown by features in the Biikk and Tisza culture. The settlement-area of the Vinia culture is also larger than the Serbian area. The most remote sites are Tordos and the related sites on the Maros and Sremski Karlovci on the Danube in the West. The origin of the Lengyel culture, which is quite different from the real Tisza culture, the Moravian painted-ware culture, Jordansmiihl and related cultures is based on influences 223 PMac, I16 ff.; K.

The last wave with the Bubanj-Gnilane-Salcutza cultures was decisive for the development of the Toszeg A culture of the Hungarian Early Bronze Age. It is impossible here to document these statements. The chronological position of individual phases in Serbia can only be alluded to here, as we have treated this question in detail elsewhere.230 The Starievo culture is on the whole contemporary with the Sesklo-Dimini culture-sequence, Vinia A and B with the era of black-polished pottery in Thessaly and Greece. Vinia B 2 is contemporary with the Early Helladic period, as imitations of Early Helladic show. The transition from Early to Middle Helladic happened during the period of the Baden culture in Central Europe.

MILOJCfIf APPENDIX AEGEAN CHRONOLOGY OF THE FOURTH AND THIRD MILLENNIA Any attempt to date the individual stages of development in the Aegean area and hence more widely in the Balkans and Central Europe must neces- sarily proceed from the established chronological data of Egypt and Meso- potamia. Only in these areas do historical sources reach so far back as the turn of the fourth millennium. What lies beyond can only be determined through comparative stratigraphy as a matter of relative chronology. The so-called low Egyptian chronology was established by Eduard Meyer; but, as research in recent years has shown, even Meyer's dates are manifestly too high.231 During the war Dr. H. Stock, lecturer at the University of Munich, succeeded, on the basis of the Egyptian lists of nomarchs, in showing clearly that during the combined duration of the IX and X Dynasties in one nome only five nomarchs ruled. In other words, the gap between VIII and XI Dynasties is to be filled with the period of rule of these five men, so that the long interval which is commonly assumed is reduced to some fifty years. Considering these facts, and the substantial shortening of the duration of the I-V Dynasties, H. Stock arrives at the following low chronology for Egypt: I-II Dyn., 2900-2675; III Dyn., 2675-2620; IV/V Dyn., 2620- 2360; VI Dyn., 2360-2200; VIII Dyn., 2200-2180; IX Dyn., 2180- 2115; X Dyn., 2115-2044; XI Dyn., 2136-1994; XII Dyn., 1994-1I781.232 In the meantime Mesopotamian chronology has also suffered a reduction, reflected clearly in the works of S. Smith,233 A. Ungnad,234 A. Poebel,235 W. F. Albright 236 and E. F. Weidner.237 It appears to me that the thesis of Smith, Ungnad and Albright stands nearer to the truth, for the finds from the graves and town-strata of Ras Shamra do not permit the assumption of any long interval between Amenemhet III and IV (1850-1792-1777) and Hammurabi.238 So we arrive at 1792-1750 for Hammurabi and 1894- 1595 for the whole dynasty, according to Sidney Smith. It may be emphasized that A. Ungnad came completely independently to exactly the same con- clusions during the war. Reckoning out the remaining dates, one gets the following result: Jemdet Nasr, 3100-2859; archaic period (Mesilin), older, 231 E.

It is important to observe that these two chronological systems cross twice and thereby clearly show their reliability. Products of the late Jemdet Nasr period meet in Syria and Palestine (Tell Judeideh, Megiddo, Byblos, etc.) with products of I Dynasty Egypt.239 Thus it is established that the Jemdet Nasr period lasted until 2900 and that the I Dynasty is inaugurated by this time. The second point of contact is offered by the Ras Shamra finds already mentioned. From this it is evident that the two chronological systems have a further support in comparative stratigraphy. From these two independent chronological systems one can on the basis of comparative stratigraphy determine the dates of Aegean development, not indeed in decades but fairly exactly. The point of departure has long been the relations between Egypt and Crete and through Crete to the Greek mainland. Two points in these are decisive. First the well-known finds of M.M. IIa pottery at Kahun, Abydos and Harageh, of the time from Sesostris II (1906-1888) to Amenemhet III (I849-I80I).240 The circumstances of the finds show that the beginning of M.M. IIa lies somewhat before 1906. Otherwise completely developed M.M. IIa pottery could not be found in the strata at Kahun of the time of Sesostris II (1906-I888). The finds from Ras Shamra appear to support this dating. During the last two years of excavation (1938-9) there were found there M.M. IIa sherds together with objects of the time of Sesostris II and Amenemhet III; so from this side also it is assured that M.M. IIa was already established by the beginning of the nineteenth century.241 In view of all these considerations, we reach the conclusion that M.M. IIa began between 1950 and 1925. A second certain point is the appearance of Egyptian stone vases in the sub-neolithic strata at Knossos.242 The study of Egyptian stone vases has been substantially advanced by G. Reisner and G. Brunton.243 In his study of the vases from Crete Reisner comes to the conclusion that the develop- ment of their types took place during the rule of the last Pharaoh of the II Dynasty (Khasekhemui), reached its highest point during the III Dynasty, 239 H.

This means that the vases found in Crete cannot have been manufactured before 2700 and there- fore that E.M. I cannot be set before 2700. In view of the consideration that the vases were not buried immediately and also that those which found their way to Crete are probably not the earliest of their kind, it is likely that E.M. I began just later, i.e. c. 2650-2600. Between these two fairly firm points lies the whole E.M. development. The native Cretan stone vases with their Egyptian shapes argue that E.M. II is to be equated approximately with the IV and V Egyptian Dynasties, and so put between 2600 and 2300.244 The stamp-seals, the appearance of the spiral in Egypt and of Egyptian scarabs in Crete, support this proposed dating of the Cretan periods.245 The plan of the mutual relationships given in Fig. I I may make the question clearer. From Crete, it can be shown on the basis of correspondence of shapes and technique of manufacture that the beginning of E.H. I cannot be put before the beginning of E.M. II, that is not before 2600.246 This can be substantially reinforced on the ground of stratigraphical observations at Aegina.247 There in the same horizon E.H. II-III vases and imported E.M. III-M.M. I vases are found together. Therefore E.H. I began certainly during the E.M. II period. Below this stratum at Aegina is a level without finds (gap in settlement) and below this a stratum with richer finds. These consist of fragments of vases decorated with neolithic Urfirnis or burnished decoration, that is, connected on one hand with late neolithic Greek finds (so-called "Danubian level" which stratigraphically immediately precedes E.H. I) 248 and on the other hand with E.M. I (Pyrgos ware) 249 and ulti- mately with Cretan sub-neolithic. Thus it is assured on the basis of the Egyptian chronology that E.H. I cannot lie before 2600oo. The question of the end of the Early Helladic culture is sufficiently clear and it may be assumed that it took place at the latest about 1950. One can link the early development of Crete also with Mesopotamian chronology. The known Cretan finds of Mesopotamian objects confirm the dating here established and need not be specially treated here.250 It is more significant that the Pyrgos finds and the late neolithic finds from Phaistos show very close relationship to the finds from Tigani on Samos.251 The objects from Samos correspond in technique of manufacture, shapes and 244 Pendlebury, op. cit., 74 f. 245 F.

It is particularly significant that the Tigani finds do not know glaze-paint, which is so characteristic of a part of the Pyrgos finds. Although there are in Tigani some imported objects which appear to belong to E.M. II, the bulk of the finds are roughly contemporary with Cretan subneolithic.252 Attention must be drawn to the fact that the Tigani finds do not come from a uniform culture-level but from the earth that was brought here from somewhere else to level the surface of the settlement, as at Orchomenos (Weinberg has overlooked this). Heiden- reich, who worked through the finds, recognized three stages of develop- ment, which can in part be established stratigraphically also.253 It appears that the last stage is roughly contemporary with Pyrgos and perhaps lasted into E.M. II, the second is certainly contemporary with Cretan late neolithic, the first stage is not yet determinable. In the meantime the American excavations in the Troad show that another culture flourished there before Troy I. On Kum Tepe at least three levels (Ia, b, c) could be distinguished. Ic is contemporary with Troy I, but Ia and b yielded objects which seem identical with Tigani II and III 254 (cf. the related earlier finds from Bos H6yiik, W. Lamb, P2 I932). Therefore we are compelled, in the light of relations through Crete, to date Troy I certainly after 2700 B.C. The finds from Troy and Tigani permit a good contact with Mesopotamian chronology. In this the results of the excavations at Mersin 255 and Tell Judeideh 256 play a great part. If we compare the stratigraphical-chronological series of Troy, Kum Tepe and Samos with that of Mersin and Tell Judeideh, we recognize a surprising agreement in the succession of certain periods and can so establish certain firm connections. In Mersin XII and Tell Judeideh XI a long development of painted pottery is unexpectedly replaced by a monochrome, black polished ware, which is completely foreign to previous developments in these areas. The finds from these levels show strong connections with Alisar I and Alaga Hoytik IV on the one side, and Tigani and Kum Tepe Ia on the other. Exactly as on the tells of Mersin and Judeideh, so also in Tigani there appear black polished pottery, white paint, white incrustation, pedestalled bowls, ledge-like lugs, absence of ribbon-handles, etc. This suffices to show that Mersin XII and Tell Judeideh XI are contemporary with Tigani II. It must further be stressed that in the older strata at Kum Tepe pedestalled bowls of the Alisar I type were found.257 So we have a closed circle, whereby it is demonstrated 252 S.

MILOJRIC first through Tigani (Samos) and secondly through Alisar I that this Kum Tepe stratum is contemporary with Mersin XII and Tell Judeideh XI. The dating of Mersin XII and Tell Judeideh XI is assured by the observation that in the lower part of this stratum at Mersin imported Jemdet Nasr pottery is found, and in Tell Judeideh XI early dynastic Mesopotamian seals were found, thus giving a dating between 2900 and 2700. It is significant that in the immediately lower stratum Tell Judeideh XII objects of late Jemdet Nasr period were found together with imported objects of the time of the I Dynasty in Egypt.258 The dating of Tigani II and Kum Tepe Ia c. 2900- 2800 is therefore the earliest possible, according to Mesopotamian and Egyptian chronology. It is further very important that in Palestine and Syria the technique of burnished decoration begins to appear from the early stage of Bronze II in Palestine (after 2800oo); this continues a similar line of development in Tigani, Kum Tepe and Bos H6ytik.259 So it is extremely likely that Tigani III and Kum Tepe Ib on the one hand, sub-neolithic- E.M. I in Crete on the other, and the so-called 'Danubian level' on the Greek mainland are to be set at the earliest about 2800. So, reckoning 100 years for Kum Tepe Ib, it is assured that the beginning of Troy I cannot fall before 2700. This can be supported also through Alisar and Alaga Hdyik, but it would lead us too far to substantiate this here. There is no need to argue fully that the treasures of Troy II (III according to Schaeffer) are contemporary with the royal graves at Alaga Hoyiik.260 Countless objects from these graves show the closest correspondence with the finds from the royal graves of Ur (c. 24oo00-2350) and objects from the palace of Naram-Sin (230I-2246), so that it is likely that Troy II came to an end about 2300. This date can be supported through Samos and Crete, on the basis of the Egyptian chronology. The still unpublished finds of the Heraion of Samos allow the establishment of a clear connection between Crete and Troy II-III, which confirms the dating already reached. So it seems to me that my proposed chronology of the Aegean development is satisfactorily established, so far as possible in this short space. Finally I should like to add some remarks on the 'high chronology' according to which Troy I was founded c. 3200. C. W. Blegen has attempted, most recently in his paper 'New Evidence for dating the Settlements at Troy', to obtain dates for the individual strata at Troy.261 This dating-in contrast to Darpfeld, whose dates are approxi- mately reckoned on the ground of general observations on the dimensions 258 H.

Blegen, BSA XXXVII (1936-7), 9 ift</page><page sequence="48">THE PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION OF SERBIA 305 of the strata and the course of development obviously obtained on the basis of imported Early Helladic sherds. So apparently a very high antiquity for the beginning of the Early Helladic culture is assumed without proofs being produced. Blegen thus reached the unproven conclusion that Troy I is to be set c. 3200-2600, Troy II 2600-2300, Troy III-V 2300- I9oo00 and Troy VI I900-1300. K. Bittel in his latest work sets Troy I c. 3200-2600, Troy II 2600oo-2300oo, Troy III-V 2300-1900, though he offers evidence only for Troy II,263 and for the dates of Troy I apparently rests on his article in AfO XIII, 299-307. Here he showed that seals of Jemdet Nasr type were found in Troy, and-although the stratification of the seals is uncertain-assumed that Troy I must already have been founded at this time. Finally S. Weinberg undertook to date the Aegean development.264 He has worked many cross-lines that are by no means secure. Starting from Troy, he used the stratification of E.H. sherds there to determine the age of the Early Helladic culture. Surprisingly, he calls for this purpose at the end of his work on the dates proposed for Troy by Blegen, and from that point determines the age of the Early Helladic culture and the remaining Aegean cultures.265 Thus he reaches the surprising result that E.H. I began about 3100, E.M. I about 3200oo. But it is quite obvious that he has lost sight of the fact that Blegen dated the strata at Troy on the basis of relations with the Early Helladic culture, so that he has fallen into a vicious circle. This makes it unnecessary to say anything further about his other dates. Finally we must go into H. Frankfort's dates. In his examination of cylinder seals he came to the conclusion (as did also Bittel) that a seal from Troy is manifestly worked in Jemdet Nasr style. Further he pointed out that a seal of this style was found in the Cyclades with very early Cycladic objects; this moved him to date Troy I and E.C. I about 3000 B.c.266 There can be no doubt about the Jemdet Nasr characteristics of the seals, but it is another question how long they remained in use and when they were buried. It may thus be pointed out that cylinder seals were used later in Troy II to decorate big storage vessels.267 So it may be suspected that the seals of Jemdet Nasr type were in use for a very long time. It is surprising also that a whole series of cylinder seals was used for the decoration of big storage vessels at Tiryns, Asine, Zygouries, Corinth, Eutresis and elsewhere.268 All 262 W.

Note that on p. 178 Weinberg rightly equates E.M. I with the III Dynasty in Egypt (c. 2670-262o), but in his table surprisingly sets it between 3200oo and 2800, which is obviously quite impossible. This of itself disposes of all Weinberg's other dates. 265 Ibid., 182. 266 H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals (1938), 232, 237. 267 H. Schliemann, Ilios (1881), 459, figs. 482-3; H.

MILOJOIt the cylinder seals here used belong according to Frankfort to the late Jemdet Nasr and the first early dynastic periods (c. 3000-2800).269 From strati- graphical observations it is quite clear that the storage vessels with this decoration are to be placed in E.H. II-III. To place E.H. II-III c. 3000- 2800 is impossible, for the chronological connections with Egypt tell a com- pletely different story. So we see that old types of cylinder seals, or old specimens, were kept for a very long time in Greece and Troy.
