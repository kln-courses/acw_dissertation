King Wayne State University Detroit, Ml IN THE STUDY OF AUTOMOTIVE IMPACT IN- JURIES to the lower extremities , the measure- ment of femoral loads is crucial to the design of instrument panels and restraint systems. Patrick et al (1)* recommended a dynamic femoral tolerance of 6228N (1400 lb) based on cadaveric knee impacts against triaxial load cells which were placed to intercept the knee along the plane of the instrument panel. A higher load was proposed by Patrick et al (2) in a subsequent paper. Cooke and Nagel (3) also used an external load cell mounted on a dropping weight to impact excised lower ex- trémités frontally and laterally at the knee. Pendulum impacts to knees of seated intact cadavers were performed by Powell et al (4) , Powell et al (5) and Melvin et al (6). The impact force was computed by means of an inertially-compensated load cell mounted on the pendulum. The fracture loads were found to be higher than those reported by Patrick et al (2). Strain gages installed on the femoral shaft indicate that high bending strains play a significant role in femoral response. This effect was noted by Wilfert and Voigt (7) from autopsy studies of 70 front seat passengers. Recently, Viano et al (8) reported on padded tibial impacts simu- lating leg interaction with a knee bolster. Cadaveric as well as ATD response data were provided. Femoral loads can also be measured by 'internal' load cells which are routinely in- stalled in the upper leg structure of the Part 572 anthropomorphic test device (ATD). This is a single axis load cell which measures ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of paper. longitudinal force. Such a transducer is not available for use in cadavers. An internal device has a major advantage over an external one. The knee can be made to impact a variety of surfaces with different stiffness and the femoral load can be measured for each of these impact conditions. Furthermore, if the load cell can have a multi-axis capability, three- dimensional femoral response data can be ac- quired. This paper describes the design, calibration and full-scale sled testing of a six-axis femoral load cell. A SIX-AXIS LOAD CELL Figure 1 is a photograph of a femoral load cell which is capable of measuring the three orthogonal force and moment components applied to the femur. It is 50 mm in diameter and 64 mm long, including two 6 mm thick end- plates and weights 8.9 N. It is designed for a maximum axial load of 30,000 n (F ) and shear loads of 15,000 N (F and F ). TheZdesign axial torque and bencting moments are all 350 N-m. The configuration shown in Figure 1 is for use in an ATD. The endplates can be changed to adapt the transducer for use in a cadaveric femur. The load cell contains four axial and four transverse beams which are instrumented with 350-fì foil-type strain gages. It is of integral construction and is machined out of a single piece of 4140 steel, heat treated to RC 38-42. CALIBRATION DATA A static calibration curve is shown in Figure 2. It shows good linearity with ne- glible hysteresis. Full-scale output is ABSTRACT A six-axis femoral load cell was design- ed, fabricated, calibrated and tested in an ATD upper leg. It has linear characteristics with adequate output and dynamic response. Its output compared well with that of load cells mounted behind a knee bolster which was impacted by an ATD instrumented with this load cell. Although the axial load was found to be well below the present limit of FMVSS208, the bending moments were found to be high. A conservative tolerance limit for axial load should be considered and cadaver data required. 3423 0096-736X/80/8804-3423$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3424 R. CHENG, ET AL. Fig. 1 - Six axis femur load cell 2 mv/v of gage excitation. The static axial stiffness of the load cell has been determined to be 3.52 x 109 N/m. Its cross-axis sensi- tivity is shown in Figure 3. It is less than 1%. For the moment channels, the cross- talk is also of comparable magnitude. Dynamic calibration is an important part of the characterization of a load cell. How- ever, the usual method of measuring transducer frequency response cannot be conveniently ap- plied to load cells. To apply sinusoidal forces of sufficient magnitude at frequencies in the neighborhood of the natural frequency of the unit is almost impossible. An indirect approach was used by assuming the load cell to be a linear second-order mas^-^nring system. The period for a damped oscillation was deter- mined from an impulsive input to the load cell. The undamped natural frequency is calculated from this period and the logarithmic decrement. For the axial component (F ), it is 8.7 kHz and that for the shear components (F and F ) is 6.7 kHz. The computed responses are sho$n in Figures 4 and 5 along with the SAE response requirements for a femur load cell. DYNAMIC VERIFICATION OF LOAD CELL OUTPUT The six-axis load cell was put through a series of dynamic tests to ensure fidelity of response and accuracy. One such method was to insert it in the upper leg of an ATD and to subject the ATD to a series of sled impacts. The load cell was located in the space normally provided for the single-axis femoral load cell€ A passive belt and knee- bolster restraint system made by Volkswagen, the VW-RA, was chosen for the purpose of generating data of current interest. The bolster was supported on load cells, the output of which is compared with the femoral load cell. A schematic of the test set up on WHAM II (Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism) is shown in Figure 6. The ATD chosen was a 95th percentile male dummy. There were two reasons for this selection. Firstly, Schimkat et al (9) have reported on knee loads generaged by a 50th percentile ATD against the VW-RA. Secondly, the full capability of the 6 outputs was to be exer- cised. By having the bolster impact the leg below the knee, it was hoped that bending moment output about both transverse axes would result. The ATD was seated in a VW Rabbit seat which was placed at its maximum distance behind the bolster. A rigid frame was used to support the bolster and bolster load cells at the same height as that in the Rabbit. The toeboard angle also simulated that of the Rabbit. The placement of the lower limbs was in accordance with FMVSS208 and the gap between the knee and bolster was 100 mm. A series of 16- to 20-g runs was made to verify femoral load cell output. Because of the mass attached to the front of the femoral and bolster load cells, it was neces- sary to make inertial corrections to the load cell data before a comparison can be made. To accomplish this correction, sled runs had</page><page sequence="3">FEMORAL LOADS 3425 §T FEMUR OOI CAL e-^X «MZ tZ Z - I O. 40. 80.

A comparison of the two outputs is shown in Figures 7 to 10 for 4 different runs.

The ringing effect of the bolster load cell and its at- tached mass can be clearly seen in these figures . FEMORAL LOAD CELL DATA FROM BOLSTER IMPACTS A series of 11 runs were made using the test set-up shown in Figure 6. The nominal g-levels were 16 to 20g. Figures 11 and 12 show the resultant forces and moments on the right leg for a 17-g run. The resultant forces and moments on the left leg for the same run are shown in Figures 13 and 14. Individual force and moment components are shown in Figures 15 through 20 for the same run. The longitudinal load, F is shown in Figure 17.

TIME (MS) X10 Fig. 20 - Femoral load cell Mz time history DISCUSSION The longitudinal loads measured in the upper legs of a 95th percentile ATD are com- parable in magnitude to those reported by Seiffert (10). They are well below the 10 kN limit specified in FMVSS208. However, the six-axis load cell also provided bending moment data which require further analysis. If a stress criterion of failure were assumed, and the idealized femur had an out diameter of 30.5 mm and an annular cross-sectional area of 319 mm2, the compressive stress due to an axial load of 5 kN is 15.7 MPa. Figure 18 shows that the peak bending moment, M , is 45 N-m. The corresponding stress due to this moment alone is 47.4 MPa which is much larger than the axial stress. The overriding effect due to bending is easy to demonstrate and confirms the findings of previous authors. It should be noted that this moment is caused by a lateral load on the knee and is due to abduction of the hip joint. In addition to this moment, another moment of higher magni- tude about an orthogonal axis is observed. This is due to tibial impact with the bolster. There is also an axial torque applied to the leg. The maximum principle tensile stress for this system of loads is slightly over 100 MPa. CONCLUSION 1. A functioning six-axis femoral load cell is available for use in ATD' s and is adaptable for use in cadaveric femurs. 2. Preliminary knee-bolster impacts reveal acceptable axial loads combined with large bending moments. 3. A conservative axial load tolerance limit for the femur should be considered. 4. Cadaveric femoral forces and moments need to be measured. 5. Impact of the tibia against a knee bolster results in a shear load across the knee joint.
