<plain_text><page sequence="1">Italian Humanism and Heidegger's Thesis of thè End of Philosophy Ernesto Grassi 1. The End of Metaphysics Two introductory presuppositions are needed. First, the term "Humanism" has such a broad and ambiguous meaning today that it seems appropriate to define it more precisely. By "Hu- manism" I mean that philosophical movement which character- ized thought in Italy from the second half of the fourteenth cen- tury to the final third of the fifteenth Century. Ficino's translation of Piato at the end of the fifteenth Century and thè speculative metaphysical Platonism and Neo-Platonism which it triggered led to a break with the Humanist approach to philosophy, which was taken up later only by isolated thinkers such as Nizolius or, out- side Italy, by Vives and later by Gracian in his theory of inge- nium. Finally, the Humanist controversy reached its height in the thought of Giambattista Vico, whose work provides an outline of the whole range of Humanism's implications. The second intro- ductory presupposition hère is that the Humanist tradition should not and may not be discussed as a purely scholarly, historical, or - as was the case for a long time - as a purely literary ques- tion. That means we must approach Humanism from the stand- point of its philosophical significance and importance today. Otherwise, Humanist research cannot be of fundamental interest. Our présent situation includes the awareness of philosophy's coming to an end as metaphysics and in precisely the way that formai logic proposes. Metaphysical thought claims to begin with original principles in order to then define reality. Because thèse immediate principles cannot be proven, they therefore- so it is claimed - cannot hâve any scientific character, for either they arise from an intuition or they come from so-called immediate évidence. In neither case do they admit scientific examination. This thesis has its most mature Statement in Wittgenstein^ Tractatus. l Science can proceed only when its generai validity can Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 13, No. 2, Spring 1980.

In other words. assertions and contradictions can occur only within concrete Systems. The System cannot found its own presupposi tions, for they are the basis of the System. Outside the symbolic world of the System, therefore, lies nothing but silence and mystery. By means of simple formulas and the adoption of rules, sym- bolic logic seeks to construct a System that has a purely formai character and so must dispense with ail metaphysics. I refer hère to the doctrines of Frege and Carnap and to Stegmiiller's asser- tion that for propositional logic the "truth value of complex mo- lecular propositions dépends upon the truth value of their ele- mentary propositions, but not upon their meaning."2 Anglo-Saxon analytic philosophy develops this doctrine in dif- férent ways. In the philosophy of science, logic receives an even greater and more influential function because it proceeds from thè idea that théories represent only certain Systems of classes and hence investigation must limit itself to thè study of thè logicai dérivations which are found to hold between éléments of thèse classes. In this way logic does not come to answer the question of what kinds of things and relations are thereby investigated. The present-day doctrines of formai semiotic, structuralism, and liter- ary theory find their philosophical foundation hère. The rejection of metaphysics naturally leads to the assertion of the primacy of rational language, which is presumed to be the only kind of language to hâve validity in the sphère of science. Along with this goes the rejection of every type of Humanism, a rejection like that which we find today among French philoso- phers, for example Foucault. 2. Heidegger's Twofold Thesis: The End of Philosophy and the Primacy of Poetic Speech It will seem odd, before I corne to the problems of the Human- ist tradition, if I now turn to one of Heidegger's doctrines. In his lecture "The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking"3 Hei- degger formulâtes a claim concerning the "end of philosophy." His thesis is that "Philosophy is ending in the présent âge."4 With</page><page sequence="3">ERNESTO GRASSI 81 this, however, Heidegger is not making a negative judgement, for he is pointing out that an epoch of thought has corne to its final conclusion: "The end of philosophy is the place, that place in which the whole of philosophy's history is gathered in its most extreme possibility."5 Traditional Western thought beginning with Piato, not with the pre-Socratics, took its departure from the problem of existence as something given, in order then to answer the question of the being of beings by means of a process of rational inference, dis- cussing this topic in the context of the relationship between exis- tence and thought taken as the problem of logicai truth. Now Heidegger claims that a far more basic original problem is passed over hère; the problem of the unhidden, openness, Lichtung ["a clearing"], in which existence itself appears. He writes: "The Substantive 'opening' goes back to the verb 'to open\ The adjec- tive licht 'open' is thè same word as 'light'. To open something means: to make something light, free and open, e.g., to make the forest free of trees at one place. The openness thus originating is the clearing. What is light in the sensé of being free and open has nothing in common with the adjective light', meaning 'bright' - neither linguistically nor factually. [In English light' means 'bright,' both linguistically and factually, unlike Lichtung.] . . . But light never first créâtes openness. Rather, light présupposes openness. However, the clearing, the opening, is not only free for brighi ness and darkness, but also for résonance and écho, for sounding and diminishing of sound. The clearing is open for everything that is présent and absent."6 Accordingly, the traditional problem of the lumen naturale is the presupposition of traditional metaphysics, but is not the origi- nal problem because light breaks in only at the place where the forests are already cleared [gelichtet]. Only in this Lichtung can there occur a différence between light and darkness. Things, hu- man beings, gods, and arts can arise and show themselves only in this Lichtung: the historicity of being-there and of the questions that are concerned with it. The new problem is also "original" because, seen strictly his- torically, it is also the leading question of the pre-Socratics, e.g., of Heraclitus and Parmenides. Heidegger shows this through his</page><page sequence="4">82 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER interprétation of the fragments of the pre-Socratics. This problem is the question of "unhiddenness" [Unverborgenheit] or, rather, the question of the structure of the original framework in which "being-there" can take place. Hence, it becomes no longer neces- sary to ask about what exists in the way traditional rational de- ductive metaphysics does. Rather, we can ask about that original process of how and where the being of what is becomes "open," "reveals itself" [sich lichtet], or "appears" (phainesthai). Heidegger's decisive thesis in this context is that it is not the rational word which can claim primacy hère, as in traditional metaphysics, but rather thè poetic metaphoric word, which pos- sesses the original power to clear a path [lichten]. Language is the "house of Being."7 Heidegger claims that man's being-there has its actual residence in language, for "where word breaks off no thing may be."8 In his interprétation of Stefan George's poem Das Wort Hei- degger writes: "thè closing line, 'where word breaks off no thing may be,' points to the relation of word and thing in this manner, that thè word itself is the relation, by holding everything forth into being, and there upholding it. If thè word did not have this bearing, the whole of things, the 'world', would sink into obscu- rity, including the Τ of the poem, him who brings things to his country 's Strand, to the source of names, ail the wonders and dreams he encounters."9 This is the originality of the poetic word. Heidegger's starting point is his interprétation of the fragments from Parmenides and Heraclitus and of the chorus in Sophocles' Antigone as well as, finally, the poems of Hölderlin and Trakl. From there he cornes to offer the thesis that the poet is the one who founds the time and the place of being-there. My plan hère is not to discuss this thought of Heidegger's any further and we can therefore leave open the question of whether and how Hei- degger justifies his thesis, beyond relying on the authority of pre-Socratic thinkers and German poets as he interprets them. This question led Herbert Marcuse, for example, to claim that Heidegger's Being and Time is indeed an epochal work, but his thesis about the function of poetic language can be regarded as simply mistaken.</page><page sequence="5">ERNESTO GRASSI 83 3. The Traditional Model of Scientific Thought The Humanist tradition is opposed to traditional metaphysics and hence is opposed to the rational dérivation of what exists. Hère is a brief characterization of what I mean. Ever since Aris- totle, to whom medieval thought returned again and again, it has been maintained that the object of knowledge is only that which "is," that which in fact exists - what is as what is (on hê on) - namely that which always and everywhere is.10 This is that which is eternai (aidion) and unmoving (akineton).n Aristotle explains that everything is either the principle or follows from it (arche as what is first and what governs). According to such an interpréta- tion, true reality is deduced by a rational process from what is "original," first, from "being" conceived as the highest thing, that is, as that which most truly is. For this reason the only scientific kind of language is logicai language: rhetorical, poetic language is excluded from the framework of science, including philosophy as metaphysics. Ra- tional thought claims to hâve a "hold" on the essence (ousia) of phenomena by means of the concept (horos) and the définition by which it can "grasp" it. In this way phenomena are "fixed" once and for all in a necessary abstraction from time and place. Ail empirical variations that are not generai are then inessential. Mere "human language," i.e., our ordinary language, which makes use of images, metaphors, and analogy cannot claim to be scientific. This is why poetry belongs to literature and rhe- toric as an art of persuasion. Neither when Descartes calls upon thè "cogito" as an original axiom for the définition of knowledge, nor when Kant deduces knowledge from original forms of expérience and thought, nor when Hegel gives his a priori dialectical déduction of the real do we ever leave this model of rational deductive thought. This model extends from ancient times through the Middle Ages up to today's analytic philosophy. The a priorism of German Idealism was the final metaphysical conclusion of such a conception. Significantly, not only rhetoric, but every form of metaphorical or imagistic thought or speech, including poetic thinking, is excluded from the field of philosophy by Descartes, Kant, and Hegel.</page><page sequence="6">84 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER 4. A Basic Problem of Italian Humanism The topic of my investigation is the contemporary relevance of Italian Humanism and its problems. From the beginning of the study of Humanism at the end of the nineteenth Century, by figures such as Voigt and Burckhardt, to Cassirer and Gentile, scholars hâve seen the essence of Humanism in the rediscovery of man and his immanent values. This widespread interprétation is, for example, the reason that Heidegger repeatedly engaged in polemics against Humanism as a naive anthropomorphism. One of the most central problems of Humanism, however, is not man, but the question of the original context, the horizon, or "openness" in which man and his world appear. The amazing thing, usually overlooked, is that thèse problems are not dealt with in Humanism by means of a logicai speculative confrontation with traditional metaphysics, but rather in terms of the analysis and interprétation of language and especially poetic language. The problem of language brings up thè decisive question of the relationship between word and object, i.e., the question of the relationship between verba and res. Beside this stands the insight that only in and through thè word (verbum) does the "thing" (res) reveal its meaning. The problem confronting us hère is radi- cally différent from what we find in the tradition. We no longer ask about thè logicai relationship between thing and thought or about logicai truth, but rather about the historical appearance in language of the thing by which a différent world is revealed in each case. Only because scholarly research has not sufficiently recognized and appraised this new approach and has looked most of ail for metaphysical and theoretical problems concerning the relationship between the world and thought could such scholars as Cassirer, E.R. Curtius, or Kristeller deny that Humanism had any philosophical significance and admit only Ficino's Platonic thought and Renaissance Aristotelianism to be représentative of the philosophy of the time. 5. The Poet as the Founder of the Community The problem discussed above found its first expression among the Humanists not with a philosopher but, significantly, with a</page><page sequence="7">ERNESTO GRASSI 85 poet - Dante. Dante posed thè question of thè relationship be- tween thè poetic word and thè historical structure of thè real. In his two theoretical works about thè essential nature of lan- guage, De vulgari eloquentia and Convivio, Dante formulâtes thè thesis that thè poet is thè founder of thè community and that therefore only he opens thè way for historicity. Humanistic thought does not emerge in his politicai work De Monarchiay which remains confined within thè deductive procedure of tradi- tional metaphysics. Rather, it émerges in thè theoretical writings about language. Dante condemns scientific Latin as an "artificial" language or, as he says, as a purely "grammatical" one because it has nothing to do with man's historical development. He claims its structure is "inalterabilis locutionis idemptitas diversis temporibus atque locis. . . . per consequens nec variabilis esse potesti12 Dante strives in this way to check thè various Italian dialects in order to see whether it is possible to create out of this material a unified historical language of his time and country. He makes use of a metaphor in which he compares his search with thè hunt for a panther that is hidden in thè depths of thè woods of thè various dialects.13 Dante claims with his poetry to open thè way to a new politicai reality and thereby to found a new epoch. The "polis" or piace of thè community is for him not there from thè beginning. It "devel- ops" or arises through thè poetic, imagistic, metaphoric word. In this sense it claims to be "politicai." "And I give this dignity to this friend [i.e., thè language of thè people] in that I let that which it has within itself as something possible and hidden to come out into thè open, as that which is its own proper task."14 Here we have thè poet as oratori The characteristic nature of language, that thè poet here pro- poses as thè calling forth of a historical task, consists in its "open- ing" function. It is directed to an "unhiddenness" in which an emperor, institutions, thè future of a country and of a community can "appear." This language is thè "theater" (from theorin, to see) of a new world. "For although we have no court in Italy in thè sense that it is recognized as thè only one in thè way that thè German King's is, it is not because we lack thè members of such</page><page sequence="8">86 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER a court. Just as the members of the German court are united by a single prince, the members of our court are united by the light of reason."15 In this way Dante came to his thesis that the expérience of the poetic word is the origin of human historicity.16 6. Philology as the Study of the Historical Word Did Dante's thesis about the function of poetic language deci- sively influence the Humanists who followed him? The primacy of the problem of language underwent a shift. The interprétation of a text, a task which faced the Humanist in thè concrete case of the translation of Greek texts into Latin, necessarily led to a renewal of the problem of the relationship between res and verba and resulted in a deepening of the problem. Hère we are not faced with the question of thè logicai relationship between thing and thought, but rather with the original dimension in which words permit the meaning of things to appear. A word can only reveal something's meaning, to which it refers, in regard to the context in which thè word stands. From the fact that the texts are différent, it follows that the same words can also have différent meanings and cannot be logically fixed for ail time. The ability to persévère in this process of self-revelation during the interpréta- tion of a text and to witness with astonishment the tranformation of a word is what constitutes the essence of self-education: philol- ogy, love of thè word. It is Leonardo Bruni (1370-1444) who assumes a key position, with his philological work, in the discussion which followed Dante. In his theological writings De interpretatione recta and De studiis et litteris and in his préfaces to translations of Greek texts, Bruni rejects every a priori unhistorical interprétation of lan- guage. A word transmits différent and changing contents of meaning in différent cases depending upon thè individuai context in which it stands. "AH words are ceremoniously connected (inter se festive coniuncta) like a multicolored floor and mosaic."17 With this, even if it might sound suprising, philology turns out, from the standpoint of its "scientific" structure, to be a stage of dialectic taken in the Aristotelian and not in the scholastic sensé</page><page sequence="9">ERNESTO GRASSI 87 of thè expression. Philology must begin with the speaker's par- ticular situation, that is, not with thè abstract, defined, and once and for ail rationally fixed meaning of a term, because what is important is the "situation" in which the term stands, the circum- stantiae that "lie around it." The source of the "actual" révélation through thè word of what is, is not "ratio," but rather that human capacity which permits words to hâve adaptibility (versutia)yls acumen,19 and "instanta- neousness"20 and so allows the corresponding "things" to appear - ingenium. This alone and not a rational process of infe- rence is able to compromise (colligere) the ability of words to reveal things. If the nature or form of language goes back to an a priori "sermo internus" the way that the scholastic interprétation postulated, then it is impossible for it to reveal thè particular concrete thing in ail its variability and richness {copia). And it is precisely this towards which the Humanists directed their attention. For them, man's évolution is revealed in language: litterae as thè Studia Humanita- tis, philology as the révélation of man's historical possibilities. Starting with this fundamental philosophical interprétation of language, the great Humanist educator Guarino Veronese pro- posed the thesis of the primacy of the litterae over the scientia rerum. In thè same spirit Angelo Poliziano declared in his polem- ics against scholastic philosophy that he would no longer cali himself a philosopher, but a "grammarian." Lorenzo Valla's claim sounds similar, when he says that he is not a "philoso- pher," but a "rhetorician." Dante claimed that thè poetic word permits reality to appear in terms of historicity. There is an obvious objection which can be raised against this position, an objection with which the Human- ists repeatedly occupied themselves. Does not precisely poetic language, with its metaphorical character, put a "veil" on the thing that it daims to uncover? The Humanists speak of poetry's velameriy behind which the actual res remains hidden. How then do the "veil"and res relate to each other? Must we not designate poetry as thè area of rational contradiction since we attribute to it the opposing functions of "veiling" and "unveiling?" This prob- lem is the main subject of Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum.</page><page sequence="10">88 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER 7. The Question of the Veil of the Poetic Word This question arises in a surprising context in Boccaccio (1313- 1375), far from every logicai or metaphysical discussion. As a Humanist, Boccaccio was interested in rescuing Roman mythol- ogy. The meaning of this mythology was endangered because it stood in obvious contradiction to Christian belief. How is it possi- ble despite this contradiction to grant a meaning to this mythol- ogy and to preserve it against a dogmatic relegation to the past? In other words, how is it possible to Interpret the Latin gods and not simply dismiss them as a meaningless confused error of the human mind? Precisely this question is thè beginning of thè Genealogia deo- rum. Boccaccio asks the king of Naples through a military man named Donnino Parmigiano how it is possible at all that the Roman emperor, for example, could permit himself to be hon- ored as a god. In order to answer this question, Boccaccio goes back to a theory of poetry based upon medieval presuppositions. Behind it there is a tradition into which we cannot enter here. Boccaccio's thesis is that poetry reveals the reality that lies behind a "veil" (velamen) which, when brought to light, permits the "thing," the res to appear in unhiddenness. His first défini- tion reads: "The fable is an exemplary and demonstrable speech which unfolds behind a veil {fabula est exemplaris seu demonstra- tiv a sub figmento locutio). If its covering is removed, then the intention of the fable becomes obvious (cuius amoto conice, pat- ent intentio fabulantis). Hence, if something appetizing appears under the fabulous veil, then the fable proves to not be some- thing useless {non erit super vacaneum fabulas edidisse)."21 We should take notice of the following in regard to this défini- tion: The fable is a exemplaris seu demonstrativa locutio. The exemplum, as we know, has a function in rhetoric similar to that of induction in logic. Inducere does not originally mean to derive a unity from a manifold by means of abstraction, but rather to trace a manifold back to a meaning giving unity in order to define it anew from there. Accordingly, the demonstratio that is the concern of Boccaccio's définition {fabula est demonstrativa locu- tio), is not rational proof as in logic, but a making visible of</page><page sequence="11">ERNESTO GRASSI 89 something, an immediate "showing." The fable brings about a "clearing" [lichten] in a twofold sensé, the way that Heidegger has revealed it in connection with définition of thè poetic word. It opens up the place and thè time in which things, people, and their institutions appear and it does this in a light effortless way, since it does not stem from a difficult, rational inference. Fables play a decisive role in this way when they arise in a world. They hâve an "archaic" meaning because they lead us {archomai as govern). Right after giving his définition of poetry, Boccaccio writes that the poetic fable "proceeds from the interior of the god {ex sinu dei procedens)." The capacity to construct fables is therefore a "gift" which only a few share. This explains the fact that the poets were always rare {rarissimi fuere poète). "The results of this inspiration are sublime, such as the compulsion of the soûl to speak {mentent in desiderium dicendi compellere)."22 The uncon- ditioned nature of language breaks forth in poetry; the poet can- not cali upon it when and as he pleases. Poetry gives voice to an original force, a power {ex sinu dei procedens) which is expressed in thè word. It possesses an "inventive" character {fervor exqui- site inveniendi) which enables it to make something obvious and open to view. As I said, Boccaccio developed his theory of poetry in order to rescue study of the Latin gods, since in the ancient poetic works gods appear in différent forms and always in the most crucial places. But now Boccaccio finds himself in the dramatic situation that he cannot grant that his own theory has validity for the Old and New Testament belief s; he himself is a Christian. Hence, he must leave behind the theory of poetry as the opening up of human history in order to identify poetry with Christian theology, that is, with a res that is outside of history. Poetic, metaphorical, fabulous language is part of the Jewish and Christian tradition. We see this in the Old Testament, for example, when Moses speaks of God as a glowing flame {Volle lo Spirito monstrare nel rubo verdissimof nel quale Moisé vide, quasi come una fiamma ardente, Iddio).23 As an example of poetic language in the New Testament, Boccaccio names the différent animal metaphors for Christ. "The holy writ is nothing other than</page><page sequence="12">90 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER a poetic fiction when we say that Christ is a lion, then a lamb or worm, then a dragon. . . . How do words of the savior sound in the gospel, if not like a speech with a stränge meaning, a manner of speaking, to which we usually give the name allegory?"24 In the next sentence he cornes to the conclusion that "Evidently poetry is not just theology, but rather theology is also poetry."25 Boccaccio repeatedly stresses the thesis that poetry has a sa- cred character. One can argue about in what country poetry first arose, but not about its always having a sacred character (cum sacris et ceremoniis veterum originem habuisse).20 The poets are called pii homines. "So in order not to extend this discussion any further, it follows from what has already been said that the poetic faculty belongs to those who are pious (pus hominibus poesiam facultatem esse) and that they derive their own origin from the sphère of the divine and receive their name from its efficacy (ex dei gretnio originem ducere et ab effecto nomen assumere)."21 8. "Unhiddenness" in Gods and in Men Boccaccio's thesis that the particular historical world with its gods, institutions, temples, and sacred acts arises through the poetic word is further developed by another Humanist thinker, Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406), who sought to carry it out to its logicai conclusion. At first glance it may seem surprising that Salutati concerns himself with a défense of poetry in a work entitled De laboribus Herculis. In the ancient tradition Hercules was a mythical symbol of man's being in the world, insofar as he was regarded as the conqueror of the foreign powers of nature and the inventor of technical works.28 Salutati's project is directed most of ail against "those who in our time glorify themselves as philosophers (qui se philosophos nostro tempore gloriantur)."29 For thèse are the ones who regard poetry such that they "belittle it in part and in part condemn it (parvi pendere y tum damnare)."30 Salutati's thesis is that only through poetry does human historicity emerge into "unhidden- ness." Poetry thereby assumes a pat he tic function as the founda- tion of the human order. The sélection of words, their sound, their rhythm leads to the récognition of the first form of lawful</page><page sequence="13">ERNESTO GRASSI 91 order which is the essence of wisdom. In order to illustrate this thesis historically Salutati introduces the example of the Macedo- nian king Archelaos, to whom the poet Euripides left the plan- ning of thè whole state (summam consiliorum tradidit)?x Through poetry, men are "diverted from that which their sensés présent to them (a sensibus taliter traducebant)"*2 Salutati repeatedly emphasizes this effect of poetry to divert man from his sensés (adeo revocavit a sensibus), that it made them believe something opposite to that which they expérience with their own eyes (quod ipsos id fecerit opinari cuius contrarium visibiliter percepissent).33 It is just this "illusion" that lifts man from his condition of ferinitas: the world, the sky, the stars with their mythic désigna- tions become "humanized." Earth and human world stand here in a fundamental interrelationship through thè rise of "being- there." The poetic word founds historical space and times that accrue to this space (quia maxima vis mentis est previdere futura, magis communiter et quasi per anthonomasiam usurpatum estt ut vaticinia predictiones ac etiam ipsi prophète iam vates certo vocab- ulo nominentur).M But is not this function of fantasy, which dépends upon the sensés, in fact déception? Salutati does not respond to this ques- tion with a rational metaphysical argument, but rather only points to the séries of works created by the poet: human society in its historicity.35 For Salutati, the deepest meaning is hidden under the surface of poetry. When he speaks of truth in this context, he does not mean logicai truth, but the self-revelation of the human world. The seers (vates) witness three things from the height of their ingenium (ingenii as altitude), whereby they ornament their his- tory as with lights (quibus sua poemata quasi luminibus exorna- tur): God, the world, and the spiritual (deum, mundum et ani- manta) and thereby name everything that they cali a creature (ut per illum omnia et in ilio omnia que ammalia dicimus esse dicantur).36 In the unhiddenness which the poetic statement reveals to us, gods, things, and créatures appear with their original meaning. But here we must ask, if we are to speak of gods, with what gods</page><page sequence="14">92 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER we are concernée!. Are we concerned with just those of the an- cients or with those of the Old and New Testaments also? Salu- tati's answer is: it is a single invisible God, which is revealed differently in différent historical forms in différent places and times. "But since they [the poets] saw that God, the architect of the world, completed everything in wisdom . . . and yet wisdom is nothing other than God himself , they called God by différent names although they feit that it was one and the same . . . so it should not seem doubtful to anyone that even with such a large number of gods, the poets did not think of many, but of just one. But they variously named this God because of the divergent vari- ety of his tasks, times, and places (Ut nemini dubium videri debeat etiam in tanta deorum multitudine poetas non de pluribus sed de uno sensisse, sed eundem deum pro varietate officiorum, temporum, et locorum diversimodis nuncupasse)."31 9. The "Clearing" of the Primordial Forest Hère we must Interrupt our discussion of the Humanist tradi- tion and return to our original question: the theoretical signifi- cance and present-day importance of Humanism, in particular in connection with Heidegger 's thesis of the end of philosophy. To summarize this thesis once again, traditional metaphysics must today corne to an end because it began with the question of the rational foundation of what is. In place of the question of logicai truth, Heidegger explains, the much more original prob- lem of unhiddenness must take its place, the question of the "clearing" (aletheia) in which "what is" first appears. Hère a new task for philosophizing arises which upholds the primacy and originality of poetic language over rational language. We recali hère Heidegger's explanation where he speaks of the etymology of the expression Lichtung. Heidegger's thesis leads us, hère at the end of our discussion, to that eighteenth-century thinker in which the Humanist tradi- tion achieves its deepest philosophical expression and signifi- cance: Giambattista Vico (1668-1774). With Vico, too, we hâve a final radical break with rational metaphysics. In his argumenta- tion Vico developed ail the theoretical thèmes that we hâve found in the Humanist tradition.</page><page sequence="15">ERNESTO GRASSI 93 With his New Science Vico does not sketch out an anthropol- ogy or a mere "new" theory of history, but rather the problem of the original unhiddenness in which man appears. He treats this problem from the Standpoint of a twofold question. For one thing, he is interested in the essence and structure of the Lich- tung {luci) with which human history appears and, on the other hand, he is interested in thè primacy of thè poetic word. Man breaks out of nature through startling fear as the expérience of his own aliénation from nature - the primordial forest - in order to create the first place of his historicity: the "new" world which arises from man's ingenious and fantastic activity and its institu- tions. According to Vico "the first cities, which were all founded on cultivated fìelds, arose as a resuit of f amilies being for a long time quite withdrawn and hidden among the sacred terrors of the religious forests. These [cultivated fields] are found among ail the ancient gentile nations and, by an id,ea common to ail, were called by the Latin peoples luci, meaning burnt lands within the enclosure of the woods."38 In another place Vico adds that "the first fire lighted on them was that which served to clear the forests of trees and bring them under cultivation."39 Vico's work is interwoven with interprétations of myths: the Hercules myth as the symbol of human "being-there," the con- quering of the primordial forests; the Cadmus myth of the forma- tion of nature into something human and social, the being put into the world as the opening up of history; or the myth of Daphne and Apollo. In Vico's interprétation Daphne's transfor- mation into a blooming tree through Apollo represents the con- trol of nature by a divine original power. This transformation into something else, something "new," characterizes mankind's ori- gin, its family tree. "Apollo begins . . . by pursuing Daphne, a vagabond maiden wandering through the forests (in the nefarious life); and she . . . on standing stili is changed to a laurei (a plant which is ever green in its certain and acknowledged off- spring) . . . and the recourse of barbarism brought back the same heroic phraseology, for they cali généalogies trees. . . . Hence thè pursuit of Apollo was the act of a god, and the flight of Daphne that of an animal."40 For Vico it is the imaginative word that gives rise to the world</page><page sequence="16">94 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER of human "being-there." The poetic word is the original and uniquely human attempt to give meaning to thè frightful power of being which reveals itself in what is. Only by attempting to con- quer this power can thè historical world arise. "We find that the principle of thèse origins both of languages and letters lies in the fact that thè first gentile peoples . . . were poets who spoke in poetic characters. . . . We disco ver in them true poetic sentences, which must be sentiments clothed in the greatest passions and therefore füll of sublime and arousing wonder."41 For this reason Vico pointed out that philosophers and philolo- gists should hâve begun with study of poetic wisdom, which was the first truth of the heathens, in the investigation of ancient philosophy and not with thè abstract and reasoned truth of the scholars.42 10. Heidegger's Theory of the Brutality of Being In his interprétation of Sophocles' Antigone (chorus, vv. 332- 75) Heidegger attempts to go over that area which poetry reveals to us in order to learn from this what man is. Beginning with Sophocles' verses that define man as the "strängest" creature, he writes: "We are taking the stränge, the uncanny [das Unheim- liche], as that which casts us out of the 'homely,' i.e. the custom- ary, familiär, secure. The unhomely [Unheimische] prevents us from making ourselves at home and therein it is overpowering."43 Because having a home is characteristic of man, but he is con- stantly thrown from it, Sophocles offers the définition of man mentioned above. "Such being is disclosed only to poetic in- sight," says Heidegger.44 The stränge is the frightful in the sensé of thè overwhelming power that breaks out in mankind's fear and so cornes out into the open. "To this place and scene of history belong the gods, the temples, the priests, the festivals, the games, the poets, the thinkers, the ruler, the Council of the eiders, the assembly of the people, the army and the fleet."45 With the overwhelming power that reveals itself in mankind, man disturbs the peace of the earth, that is, of the growth, thriv- ing, and life of those who live without effort, by taking them out of their fixed order and subjugating them to his harness. Man</page><page sequence="17">ERNESTO GRASSI 95 now assumes command by forcing, capturing, and subjugating by means of his work and thereby puts things to use by his historical being in the world. "The violence of poetic speech, of thinking projection, of building configuration, of the action that créâtes states is not a function of faculties that man has, but a taming and ordering of powers by virtue of which the essent opens up as such when man moves into it."46 Man as the violent agent and creator who falls into the un- spoken stands, accordingly, in a situation that is constant ly füll of risk, before an abyss. In and through man's "putting himself into practice" he is confronted with what is overwhelming, namely with history, whereby that in which the human world appears, needs the public "open" places [Stätte der Offenheit] in order to govern and be a power. By taking up this thesis of the primacy of the art of the poetic word, Heidegger Claims that art is what makes it possible for the power to govern to arise from nature. "It is through the work of art as essent being that everything eise that appears and is found is first confirmed and made accessible, explicable, and under- standable as being or not being."47 In another piace he says: "We do not learn who man is by learned définitions; we learn it only when man contends with the essent, striving to bring it into its being, i.e. into limit and form, that is to say when he projects something new (not yet présent), when he créâtes original poe- try, when he builds poetically."48 11. Conclusion Both historical and theoretical conclusions resuit from the fore- going considérations. Historically, we should note that Heideg- ger's définition of Western thought as rational deductive meta- physics that arises and unfolds exclusively from the problem of the relationship between beings and thought, i.e., in the frame- work of the question of logicai truth, does not hold. In the Hu- manist tradition, specifically in the controversy with rational thought and logicai truth, there was always a central concern for the problem of the primacy of unhiddenness, openness, that in which historical "being-there" can first appear.</page><page sequence="18">96 HUMANISM AND HEIDEGGER For this reason we need to reassess and revise our historical catégories, which today still govern our thinking. Most of all we must examine our understanding of the beginning of modem thought, which Starts with Descartes' rationalism and - in the same way - we must review our assessment of Humanism, which Heidegger himself always viewed and criticized in the light of the usuai interprétation which takes it to a discovery of man and his anthropological capabilities. A further conclusion from the assertions made hère has to do with the transformation of thè basic catégories by which we try to interpret the meaning of reality. The traditional catégories can no longer claim validity, but rather those that arise in the particular context of a historical situation. Philosophical language is no longer understood as rational, but that language through which and in which there is a "clearing" [Lichtung] in which an âge, an authority, a custom, or an institution can appear and assume power and in which its dangerous nature can appear. Instead of thè logicai problem of truth as correspondence (adaequatio) there is a need to consider the problem of "émergence," "appearing," or phainesthai. In the place of question of ratio and its inferential method, we face the question of the structure of the ingenium in thè treatment of Vives or Gracian, a question that then becomes the main topic of thought in thè Mannerism of Tesauro and Pelle- grini and, finally, in Vico. This is the main problem of the "un- covering" or "unveiling" of the real. We hâve pointed to the parallelism between Heidegger's thought and the Humanist tradition, not in order to interpret the latter in terms of a Heideggerian Existentialism or, conversely, to force Heidegger's theory of "being-there" into a tradition which he did not himself know ànd which he misunderstood whenever he referred to it. The main object hère has been to erect a his- torical framework in which the present-day relevance of the prob- lems of Humanism can become visible to us, that Humanism which both theoretical interprétations and literary studies as well as pure historical scholarship hâve completely failed to recognize.
