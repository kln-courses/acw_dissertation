<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AS ABSOLUTE, YET RELATED TO ALL Preliminary Outline of the Doctrine Main theses: 1) Absoluteness and Relativity are correlatives. Absoluteness involves relativity, but not this or that particular relative thing. 2) Subject-Object relations, given a particular subject and object, are internal to the subject; subjects as such are relative. 3) Object-Subject relations, given a particular object and subject, are external to the object; objects as such are non-rela tive or absolute. 4) General-Particular relations are external to the general; generals as such are absolutes. 5) Particular-General relations are internal to the particular; particulars as such are relatives. 6) Particulars are also relative to their predecessors, but non-relative to their successors. 7) Complexes are relatives, constituents are absolutes. 8) The Supreme non-relative or The Absolute is object for all subjects, universal of universals, simple constituent of all things, without predecessor, causal factor in all, effect of nothing. 9) The Supreme relative or The Surrelative is subject aware of all objects, particular inclusive of all particulars coactual with it, the most complex actual totality, without actual successor, resultant of all actual causes. 10) Apart from the Surrelative and The Absolute, nothing is relative or absolute in general, or in all, rather than some, relationships. 24</page><page sequence="2">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 25 Relative Terms: Non-relative Terms: Subjects Objects Particulars, Concretes, Actuali- Generals, Abstracts, Possibili ties ties Complexes, Wholes Simples, Constituents Successors, Effects (as actual Predecessors, Causes events, not mere abstract The Absolute: the property of features of events) having adequate awareness, The Surrelative: actual ade- regardless of what world quate awareness of the actual there is to be aware of? universe?cognitive adequacy cognitive adequacy as such, with determinate content. abstracted from any deter minate content. ?1. BRADLEY ON EXTERNAL RELATIONS SEVERAL decades ago the subject of external relations was reopened, as a result of the contention?by F. H. Bradley and others?that relations, so far as real, are all internal. It is a violent historical paradox that this denial of external relations came from those who were styled "absolutists," and that the de fence of such relations came from those who were commonly supposed to be rejecting any conception of an absolute. This confusing inversion of terminology was largely overlooked, and the result was a failure to detect the historical continuity of problems and to draw the lessons of the total historical debate. There was a reason, or at least an excuse, for classing as "absolutism" the denial?instead of, as in the Middle Ages, the assertion?of external relations. Medieval thinkers had them selves identified the supreme or superlatively excellent being, God, with the purely absolute, non-relative, independent, or non-temporal (these four terms come to the same thing). The modern absolutists correctly reasoned as follows: the supreme being must be all-inclusive, since otherwise there would be a total reality superior to the supreme, which latter would have the status of a mere constituent of this total. On the other hand, if supreme is identical with absolute or non-relative, and yet the</page><page sequence="3">26 Charles Hartshorne supreme must include all things, and hence all relations, the result is a contradiction. Bradley (in his famous Appearance and Reality) took the heroic?or fantastic?measure of dealing with the contradiction by declaring that relations, whether in ternal or external, are unreal. Since there are no relations to exclude, the non-relative need not exclude any, and thus can be all-inclusive?in the Pickwickian sense that there is nothing dis tinguishable for it to either exclude or include. It thus becomes not so much the total as the sole reality. Unfortunately, few seem to have seen that the two proposi tions, There is something absolute, and There is something in clusive (or outside of which there is nothing), are not necessarily responsible for the contradiction above referred to. The contra diction may result only from the additional and really self-con tradictory proposition: the non-relative and the all-inclusive are identical. This proposition was formally rejected as "Panthe ism" in the Middle Ages; but it was nevertheless implied in the medieval doctrine that absolute as such is identical with sup reme. For whatever the supreme may be, it cannot be less or more than all-inclusive (the very notion that there is a better than the totality self-contradictorily posits a supertotality in clusive of the value of this "better"); and therefore, if supreme is the same as absolute, the absolute must be all-inclusive, hence contain relations, hence be relative after all. Thus the axiom responsible for the pantheistic confusions in Spinoza and in Bradley is the very one that prevented medieval theory from solving the problem of absolute-and-relative in a consistent man ner: the unfounded notion that supremely excellent means "in all respects absolute." This axiom was, to be sure, attacked by William James and others, but often without clarity on the crucial point, which is that it is one thing to identify supreme with all-inclusive, quite another to identify supreme with ab solute. Absolute is identical neither with supreme nor with inclusive. In spite of this basic confusion, on both sides of the contro versy, the recent debate concerning external relations did, I think, accomplish something. By a relation to Y being external to the term X was meant that X could have been exactly the</page><page sequence="4">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 27 same in nature had there been no such relation to Y.* For example, the number two, which I think of, would have been the number two even though I had never thought of it. Also, the number two, in its formal, mathematical sense, is the number two, regardless of whether it is the number of eyes in my head or not. Had I never existed with my two eyes, two would still have been one more than one, a half of four, and one less than three. To deny this independence of the mathematical two is to assert that mathematics is the study of the biographies of all persons who count to two that ever have existed or ever may exist, and (following the principle further) that there is no dif ference between pure mathematics, psychology, sociology, histo ry, prophecy, physics, and so on. But on the other hand, to understand persons fully, one must know some arithmetic. The experience which has as object the number two would have been a perceptibly different experience if no such object had been given to it. To grasp the biography and individual psychology of a Bertrand Russell one should have to have a fairly deep knowl edge of mathematics. But all of this knowledge, as mathematical knowledge, could be imparted to a student who was given no notion that any such person as Russell ever existed. Thus rela tions between numbers and persons are external to the one, but in some instances internal to the other, or at least to their ex periences or states. It may of course be said that the biographical part of mathe matics, though a real part, is less important, for a certain purpose, than other parts. But the notion of importance is meaningless save with reference to alternatives of action and a common measure of value (the purpose spoken of) which will be identi cal whichever alternative is chosen?and this is again the notion of external relations. Take it how you will, external relations there must be. Even Bradley, the philosopher who most stoutly denied the possibility of external relations, admitted and emphasized that the consequence of such denial is the reduction of all thought to self-contradiction, and of the idea of relation to an absurdity. But before yielding to this defeatist conclusion, logic is obliged * See G. E. Moore's essay, "External and Internal Relations," in hii Philosophical Studies.</page><page sequence="5">28 Charles Hartshorne to consider very carefully indeed the arguments by which it is supposed to be established. One of Bradley's arguments against external relatedness was that it involves a vicious regress. If A is not, in its very being or identity, related to B, then we must relate A to the relation to B to get A really related. And this leads to a series of relations to relations to relations..., a series which is vicious not only because it is infinite but because it can never really arrive at a relation to B which really is A's. Is this argument sound? I answer yes, if it is taken to prove one thing; no, if taken to prove another. It is sound if taken to prove that relations cannot be external to all their terms. For if no term is constitut ed by the relation, then the relatedness is additional to all the terms, and must be related to them by a further relation, and so on. But the argument is unsound if taken to prove relations are external to no terms, that every term must be constituted by the relations in which it is. For suppose an ARB internal to A and external to B. Since the relationship is internal to A, it is nothing additional to A. A just is something-related-to-B. Thus, for ex ample, the experience of B is not first the experience, plus re lation to B, but rather there is one entity, experience-of-B. What seems to be a separable constituent in this entity, "experience," or "experience of," is not the concrete term standing in relation to B, but rather experience in general, a mere class concept or generic property. "The experience of" taken alone is nonsense, there is only the experience of B, or the experience of C. A dif ferent object means a different subject if by subject we mean a concrete cognitive state. But with a different subject there might still be the same object. There can be several knowers of B, for instance, if B is the number two. True, the knowers must differ in some objects, so that really we have the knower-of-B-and-var ious-other-unspecified-objects. But all this is one entity, one cognitive state. Relatedness to the given objects is no addition to the being of the subject?as an actual awareness or experience ?but is that being. Thus there is no regress. Only if we try to get B related to A does the regress arise. For B, we have sup posed, is not in itself related to A. To get it so related would mean to add to B's mere being-B, its being-related-to-A, and this addition would itself be a relating, and thus we would relate B</page><page sequence="6">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 29 to relation to A, and so on. But the point is we do not have to get "B related to A." An external relation is only nominally a relation "of" the term to which it is external. It is not that certain terms externally have relations, but that certain relations have terms, in such fashion that the terms, some of them, do not really "have" the relations. It is only nominally that the term B is "in the relation," if that means that the term has a relation of inness to the relation. Rather, the relation possesses the term; and hence the other term A, to which the relation is internal/ in possessing the relation, possesses the term B also. For example, XY, as a complex, is related to X. It has X as constituent. This "having" is the relation. But to say that X "is a constituent" had by XY is only a way of saying over again that XY has X in a certain manner. It is the complex, not the constituent, that here has relation. To deny this is to deny the very ideas of ana lytic complex and constituent; it is, as Bradley admits, to make all rational thought and analysis self-contradictory. And, as we have seen, we need not and should not deny it. ?2. Internal Relations and Absolute Terms Bradley attempts also to prove that even internal relations are inconceivable. But here, as in the other case, though more subtly, he really substitutes for the question, "can relations be internal to any terms?" the very different question, "can they be internal to all terms?" Apart from this distortion of the issue, Bradley can only be trying to get us to admit that an entity which has constituents cannot be conceived as one entity, that there can be no such thing as integration, or as something which, though itself one, yet contains a plurality. This is the point at issue, and it seems we should on no account concede it; for, as we have seen, even external relations must be internal to something; so that to give up internal relations would be to give up all rela tions. And would it not be absurd, on the basis of argument, which is a relating of ideas, to admit that there are no relations? We seem led to the conclusion that there are both internally and externally related terms, both terms having relations and terms which relations have without the terms having the relations. In the end, Bradley admits there is an entity which, though</page><page sequence="7">30 Charles Hartshorne one, contains many; however, he says the oneness is real and the manyness is more or less "unreal." There are many more or less unreal cases of many, and there are many degrees of unreality. Bradley is merciless enough toward traditional theology and its contradictions, yet his own position seems just as much a play ing fast and loose with concepts. The case against Bradley can be stated with reference to his famous formula: If the relation does nothing to the terms (fails to qualify or contribute to their being), it is idle; if it does modify the terms, it is vicious. To this we may reply, if the rela tion does nothing to a term A, it is indeed idle for that term, in the sense that it is innocuous and useless to it. But who ever thought that the purpose of studying arithmetic was to be useful to numbers? On the other hand, if the relation does something to, contributes to the being of, the term B, it need not for all that be vicious. For an enjoyment-of-arithmetic is under no neces sity to be first something without relation to arithmetic and then something with this relation. Therefore, the relation does not "alter" the term, it simply is part of its being. The conclusion that relations have both internally and externally related terms derives part of its importance from the truth that the vital absolute-relative problem is, as we have seen, connected, if not actually identical, with the problem of external and internal relations. Absolute means independent of relations; since relations of which a term is independent are those external to it, they are only nominally "its" relations. Hence, if every relation is internal to some, but not all, terms, then for every relation there is something absolute, so far as that relation is concerned. This gives the general and weak meaning of absolute, namely, independence of at least some relations of which the thing said to be absolute is a term. The stronger meaning, "The Absolute," is readily defined as the universally absolute term, the term which is absolute in every relation having it as term. This, of course, is very different from Bradley's definition of the Absolute. I shall come to that. Let us consider whether such a universally absolute term is possible. We have taken, as the most indubitable example of an absolute term, the number two, as object of a particular human consciousness. Here is a relation which evidently does not enter</page><page sequence="8">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 31 into the term. This example proves two things at once: that the abstract is absolute or independent in relation to the concrete, and that the known is, or at least may be, absolute in relation to the knower. Let us consider the first-mentioned point. To say of an abstract factor of reality that it is not wholly depen dent on relationships is only to say again that it is abstract. For the abstract is what can be considered while various other things are omitted from consideration. The abstract is what can be abstracted, detached in thought and, at least potentially, in actuality, from various relationships or contexts, and yet in this detachment still be the identical entity. Obviously this is the same as to say that some at least of the relations having the entity as term are external to it. This is the only intelligible meaning of absolute or independent. That numbers are independent of our thinking them is only what we should expect from their abstractness, compared to any actual thinking. But suppose the object of awareness is concrete, for example, a past event. Does such an event contain relation to the subsequent awareness of it? Who could have dis covered in the consciousness of Shakespeare any relation, how ever slight, to Bernard Shaw? But in the consciousness of Shaw it seems we can easily detect relation to Shakespeare. Look deep ly enough into anything and you will, it may be, find its ances tors and its history inscribed upon its nature. But will you equally find its posterity and its destiny? This is the question of indeterminism, in one of its forms. There is a purely logical reason both for asserting that effects are related to causes and for denying that there is in a cause any relation whatever to ("its") particular future effects. Temporal relations must be somewhere, properties of something, and if particulars are not related prospectively to particulars, then they must be related retrospectively to particulars?else there would be no temporal order of particulars. But particulars cannot be related pro spectively to particulars. (I agree with Ewing that relations of causal entailment do, in spite of Hume, run toward the future, but only as relations whose terms are kinds of particulars rather than particulars. Causal prediction concerns statistical frequen cies and approximate characters, not particular events in their exact particularity.) The reason there can be no relation to</page><page sequence="9">32 Charles Hartshorne future particulars is that what has relation to X has X, for X is a constituent of relation-to-X. Now if the cause has the effect, by virtue of having relation to it, then in the cause the effect already is, and the whole time process is the illusion of new events, whereas all events were precontained in their predeces sors. This reduces the idea of time to an absurdity. On the other hand, the notion that the effect really has relation to the cause, and hence has the cause, is not similarly absurd. For change still remains, in the form of addition of new terms with their new relationships. True, the past must then still exist in the depths of the present; but this does not contradict the past's distinction from the present. For a constituent of a whole is not identical with that whole. "When the past event was present" means, on the assumption just mentioned, when the event was a whole which nothing possessed as a part; that the event is "no longer present but past" means that now a new and more in clusive whole possesses it as part. Our human consciousness has, of course, but a feeble direct awareness of the inclusion of the past in the present, via memory. But human direct awareness is not the measure of reality. As we have repeatedly seen, a whole has relation to its parts, but, unless the whole is through and through "organic"?and this cannot be if any analysis is possible?a part need not have relation to the whole. XY is not itself without X, but X may be itself without XY. "Being part" may be an external relation. Thus the present may contain the past without thereby infecting the past with its own presentness, its own novel totality. But if the past contained this totality as its relatum, nothing novel or additional could occur. ?3. God qua Absolute An absolute term, I have held, is abstract, object, cause, predecessor, constituent, rather than concrete, subject, effect, successor, whole?in any relation in which the term is absolute. That the absolute or independent being, as such, is cause in all cause-effect relationships is traditional doctrine; also, one spoke of him as first cause, as though he were predecessor of all; but that he must also be abstract not concrete, object not subject, con</page><page sequence="10">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 33 stituent not whole, these seem somewhat startling implications. I maintain that they follow as rigorously as the others, so far as the absolute being as such is concerned. It is worth noting too that if God (qua absolute) is abstract constituent of all things, then there is a clear meaning for the divine "immanence." What can more easily be in all things than something abstract? And the implication that the absolute is object for all subjects makes more sense than might appear at first thought. Here I wish to call attention to a little-noticed truth: to be known by all sub jects is fully as distinctive a status as to know all objects. Take any individual other than God. It surely cannot be that this individual is known by all others. Ordinary individuals are known by their neighbors, by some few to whom they are sig nificant; the greater the individual, the more widely will other individuals tend to take note of his existence. Only God can be so universally important that no subject can ever wholly fail or ever have failed to be aware of him (in however dim or un reflective a fashion.) Thus the unique status of object-for-all subjects is to be correlated with the more commonly recognized one of subject-for-all-objects. The difference between them is that the latter means, "having relations to all objects," and thus implies universal relativity; the former means that all subjects have relation to the one object, without the latter having rela tion to them. ?4. Independence and Contingency It may, indeed, appear that to be object for all subjects, as a status, must consist in a relation to all subjects, and so imply relativity. But closer attention disproves this. For the property of being such that all possible subjects will, if and when actual, have one as object involves relation, not to any particular set of subjects, but to the class of possible subjects, to subjects as such. It need make no difference to the Universal Object, the Absolute, exactly which subjects are actual and therefore actually have it as object. Its universality means merely that there cannot be a subject not having it as object. But it is quite different with the universal subject. It must know which objects are actual and which merely possible; otherwise it will not "know all things,"</page><page sequence="11">34 Charles Hartshorne or be the universal subject. Here we have relations to actual con tingent things, and such relations, being themselves contingent, render whatever contains them subject to contingency, change, dependence, relativity. In contrast, relations to the non-contingent, to what does not first have to come into being, and can never change, con stitute no threat to independence. For independence means that a thing "will be itself whether or not the thing of which it is said to be independent exists or has a certain character." But the "whether or not" refers to contingent alternatives, and is meaningless otherwise. Relationship to the necessary is in truth neither dependence nor independence, but a common property of both dependent and independent things, neutral to the dis tinction between them. All things are related to the necessary. (Logicians define a necessary proposition as one "implied by every proposition," whether necessary or not.) ? 5. Independence is Relation to the Possible as Such Suppose one were to argue: "externally related" or "in dependent of relationship" is itself a relation, and thus a thing can be independent of relation-to-X only if X is there as term of this independence relation. Thus the independent is depen dent, and there is a contradiction. I venture to think this a sophistry. For the absoluteness of the term in question is not, strictly speaking, with respect to relation to X, but with respect to a kind of relation, which can be defined, as logicians say, intensionally, or without mentioning X. Thus arithmetic is in dependent, not merely of my awareness of it, but of any particu lar awareness. Nothing is added to this attribution of independ ence by saying, "and also arithmetic is independent of my aware ness." This is not an addition, but a mere illustration. Accord ingly, it seems clear that absoluteness does not require relation to particular or actual terms. As for relation to an intensional class of terms, this constitutes no dependence, no departure from absoluteness; for the ultimate intensional classes are non-con tingent, whereas the relativity negated by absoluteness is relati vity to the contingent. The ultimate possibilities are as such necessarily real (even though not "actual"), they could not pos</page><page sequence="12">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 35 sibly have failed to be the possibilities which they are, and it is with reference to them that absoluteness is defined, not with reference to actuality. Independence of relationship is neutrality or indifference to relational alternatives, so that any possible relation must, if actualized, be compatible with the term in its entire nature. Hence it "makes no difference" to the term which relations are actualized. If the foregoing is correct, then to achieve a consistent idea of "absolute" we need not attempt the impossible task of ab stracting from all relationships, but only of abstracting from relationships to particular contingent things. This is by no means impossible. The number "two" involves no particular things whatsoever. If it be objected that there could be no such thing as two were there no contingent particulars, no actual couples, the reply is that this, if granted, would only mean that to con ceive two is to conceive that the class of particular contingent things is not empty and has at least two members; and it is one thing to say that every existent member of the class of particular things exists contingently and another to say it is contingent that there are some members of the class or other. It may be necessary, not contingent, that there be some contingent things or other. The existence of the human race may be contingent in the sense that the totality of existence might not have contained the human race; but it does not follow that the totality of con tingent existence might have been zero. The contingency of each member of the class of contingent existence means that there might have been no member just like it; but the class itself may have been necessarily represented by some members or other. If not this, then that; if not that, then the other. Still otherwise expressed, there are various alternative possibilities, but perhaps all possibilities are positive. There is then no such thing as the possibility that no possibility be actualized. There is no possibili ty of "nothing contingent," but only of this contingent thing or that contingent thing or some other contingent thing (other than sheer nothing). I believe this is the correct view, though I shall not attempt to prove its correctness in this essay. The import of the foregoing is that the absoluteness of God need not imply his non-relationship to the creation as such, but only to the contingent alternatives of creation. Every creature</page><page sequence="13">36 Charles Hartshorne may be contingent, in that some other creature was possible in stead of it, but "no creation whatever" may not be a possibility. In that case, God might be essentially "creator," incapable of not creating, though perfectly capable of not creating this or that creature?any creature you choose. Admitting free alternat ives of creation does not force one to admit "not creating any thing" as one of the alternatives. Hence there is no absurdity in the idea that God is relative to creation as such, that he is bound to create, provided he is not thus bound with respect to any given creature or set of them. In this way we escape the other wise embarrassing questions: Why is there a world? Could the absolute have refrained from producing the relative? Since absolute is defined in terms of relativity, as such, it cannot be independent of relativity in every sense, but it can be indepen dent of which relative things there are. ? 6. The Independence of Enduring Individuals We have considered external relations between abstract and concrete, and between past and present. Suppose now we con sider the relations of individuals with self-identity through time, say, individual animals to their environments. To say of such an enduring individual that it is independent of its environment can only mean this: with respect to certain abstract qualities, the individual is the same regardless of changes around it. All con crete enduring things have some independence in this sense. Thus a man will be a "human being," regardless, within wide limits, of what happens. He will not lose his essential humanity and basic personality traits because of ordinary changes in weather, scenery, or other surroundings. But every change in weather or scenery alters, more or less drastically, the concrete flow of sen sations entering into the person's experience. And extreme changes in weather or scenery might temporarily or permanently rob even Abraham Lincoln of his moral humaneness. The partial independence of a good man's goodness (the abstract quality, "being good" as such) with respect to varying relationships may, then, be taken as the "weak" analogue of the absolute indepen dence of the divine goodness as such with respect to all con tingencies. Thus God will be good no more and no less if this</page><page sequence="14">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 37 happens than if that happens instead. But it clearly does not follow that his more concrete qualities will be unchanged. It is one concrete act to be good to Robinson, if Robinson sins great ly, another to be good to him if he is as righteous as man may be. Yet the goodness of the divine treatment of Robinson may be the same in degree or eminence. Another abstract quality that permits independence is wis dom. A shrewd man may be about equally shrewd in facing heat and cold, sickness and health, friend and foe. Similarly, but eminently, God may be all-knowing and all-wise regardless of what facts there are to know. Be the facts these and these, he knows these and these; be they those and those, he knows those and those; either way his omniscience is fully preserved. But the concrete knowledge which he has is by no means the same; for it is sheer contradiction to say that the knowledge that P is true is the same as the knowledge that P is not true. He who infallibly knows P is true cannot be concretely and in all respects the same subject as he who infallibly knows P is false; indeed the existence of either subject excludes the existence of the other. Thus an actual divine knowing cannot be exclusive of relations, cannot be wholly absolute. ? 7. The Supreme as All-inclusive To include relations is to include their terms. Hence to know all is to include all. Thus we must agree with modern absolutism and othodox Hinduism that the supreme being must be all-inclusive. The only way to keep both the absoluteness and the inclusive knowledge required by the religious idea is to re strict the absoluteness to an abstract aspect or dimension of the supreme being. The supreme in its total concrete reality will be the supereminent case of relativity, the Surrelative, just as, in its abstract character it will be the supereminent case of non relativity?not only absolute, but the absolute. Now it is in truth just as easy to define a strong or eminent, as contrasted to a weak or ordinary, sense of the term relative as of the term absolute. A superior listener to a poem is indeed relative, in his flow of thought and feeling, to the reading of the poem. But many other poems, perhaps, are being read in the world, and toward these other</page><page sequence="15">38 Charles Hartshorne readings the given listener is impassive, unrelated, absolute, in dependent. They affect him not, for he does not hear them; and many of them could not greatly affect him, for they are in un known languages. Thus to be relative in the weak sense is to be related to a mere portion of the actual totality of terms permit ting such relativity, and not to all aspects even of these (for not all the possible contributions even of one poem are received by any one hearer.) To be relative in the eminent sense will accord ingly be to enjoy relations to all that is, in all its aspects. Sup reme dependence will thus reflect all influences?with infinite sensitivity registering relationship to the last and least item of events. Is this not genuinely something eminent and supreme? Could any man exhibit such sensitivity, or anything remotely approaching it? Obviously not. Indeed, only an all-knowing be ing can, in any intelligible sense, be thus supremely relative to all beings. For such relativity means that every difference makes a difference in the all-relative one, that for every diversity any where there is a diversity of relationships in him. Only the con ception of an intuition whose datum is the universe gives any positive meaning to such an idea. Mere "matter," supposed to be the most passive of entities, must really be the most ?mpassive, if passivity means ability to reflect difference in other things. The closer we get to a "merely material" individual, the closer we come to something for which nearly all changes in the universe make no appreciable difference at all. The impassivity of a turtle is great compared to that of a man, but that of a bit of moss is greater still, and it is exceeded by that of a bit of rock. Only the crudest or nearest alterations of other things produce change in relationships perceptible as changes in the bit of rock itself. But a man can be put into agonies or ecstasies by some subtle shift in human thought on the other side of the world, or even a thousand years in the past. ? 8. The Principle of Eminence The foregoing procedure of identifying a weak sense of ab soluteness and also of relativity, and attributing these, in emin ent sense, to deity illustrates what has been called in theology the "way of eminence." Whatever is good in the creation is, in su</page><page sequence="16">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 39 perior or eminent fashion, "analogically not univocally," the property of God. Thus knowledge, purpose, life, love, joy, are deficiently present in us, eminently and analogically present in God. It is only in this manner that the idea of God acquires any positive meaning controllable by analysis, and yet free from anthropomorphic crudities. Opposed to the positive way of eminence and analogy is the famous negative theology, the via negativa, which proceeds by "removing" predicates as unworthy of application to God. This negative way was never consistently followed out, yet, in so far as followed, it interfered with the consistent use of the way of eminence. Whereas the way of emin ence, if consistently executed, treats the categories impartially, the way of negation plays favorites among the categories. Thus there is a weak or ordinary sense of independence of relation ships and a supreme or eminent sense which was applied to God. But although there is similarly a weak or ordinary sense of re lativity, the eminent form was not attributed to God. Impossible, said theologians, for relativity is bad in principle; only indepen dence is good in essence. Similarly, cause is good and God is eminently cause; but effect is bad or essentially inferior, and there is no eminent effect. This procedure is scandalously il logical and arbitrary. First, it is just as easy, as we shall see, to conceive an eminent sense of effect as of cause. Second, cause it self, at least in the form of conscious or voluntary cause, implies relation to effects so far as these are known by the cause. Third, good is obviously a relative conception. What would either "good" or the "cause of good" possibly mean if there were no relations, hence no relation of fulfillment to purpose, of means to end? And nobody in his actions can give expression to any such notion as that relation as such is a defect, to be avoided wherever possible. Pragmatically, the alleged notion is empty. ? 9. An Eminent Effect I said above that it is quite possible to conceive an eminent case of effect. Effects are better or worse; and Plato long ago showed how to formulate the idea of an eminent effect or crea tion. The animate creature is superior to the inanimate, the rational animal to the non-rational. Moreover, the universe as</page><page sequence="17">40 Charles Hartshorne an effect is superior to all other effects, as the whole or inclusive effect is superior to parts or included effects. Suppose then that the universe is, in eminent fashion, animate and rational. It will, accordingly, be supreme among effects. All other creatures will be its members, inferior as such. For instance, all will de pend, as it will not, upon an external environment. Thus the universe, patterned after the ideal of rational animality, will be as distinctive among effects as the creator of the universe is dis tinctive among causes. If the universe is not patterned thus, the creator did not do a good job of creating. He created something inferior to what he might have created. On the other hand, if the universe is eminently animate and rational, then either it is God, or there are two eminent beings, God and Universe, and a third supereminent entity, which is the total reality of God-and universe. The dilemma is satisfactorily dissolved only by the admission that the God who creates and the inclusive creation are one God. Then the two eminences under cause and effect are two aspects of God rather than two Gods, or than a God and an eminent being other than God. ? 10. Abstract and Concrete in God If Cornford and Demos are right, the two Gods in the Timaeus, the creator God and created God, or the "eternal God and the God that was to be," are aspects of one and the same deity. God in one aspect is creator, in another and more complete aspect is both creator and created, is both concrete world-soul and abstract eternal reason by which the world-soul inspires itself and all lesser beings. The merely eternal God is the element of sheer rational purpose. This element is indeed absolute, un affected by contingent relationships. But the concrete acts which achieve the eternal purpose can do so only by embracing within themselves all contingent relationships. These concrete acts are analogous to those of a human person; as the abstract eternal purpose is analogous to the underlying general purpose a man may pursue throughout his life, or to the enduring "character" a man exhibits under diverse circumstances and through diverse experiences, sensations, feelings. The basic difference between man and God can be seen in this, that whereas the character</page><page sequence="18">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 41 individual to a man cannot be stated in merely abstract terms, such as good or wise or perverse or foolish (all such abstractions being, for all that could be known, applicable to other individu als) , God's character, on the contrary, can be described in utterly abstract terms which yet are unique to him as the one divine individual. Only one individual can ever be omniscient, primor dial-and-everlasting, all-loving, supreme cause of all effects, sup reme effect of all causes. Only one individual can ever be divine. Here is an extremely abstract character which yet is the defining characteristic of a self?or person. This character, though indi vidual to God, is so abstract or non-specific that it can be cor related with any possible character you please in its correlate, the world. Whatever the world may be, God can know that world in his uniquely adequate way; whereas some possible worlds would exclude human knowers altogether. The utter abstractness of the individual essence of God is what makes him, as concrete individual, completely independent of relational alternatives for his mere existence. Because the defining character of his self-identity is utterly neutral to such alternatives, the concrete embodiment can be wholly expressive of and variable with re lations. The character can be expressed in any relational pattern, hence God can contain any relational pattern and still be him self. To combine in one's individuality the extremes of abstract and concrete, universal independence or non-relativity and uni versal dependence or sensitivity, is to have maximal security and value as an individual. To be sure, the character of sensitivity, or non-neutrality to alternatives, is always, even in ordinary cases, as an abstraction, something more or less independent or neutral. Partiality does not itself play favorites; only partial sub jects do that. Not kindness but kind persons respond variously to varying needs. However, incomplete kindness is never wholly independent, since any personal form of such incompleteness (for example, mine or yours) will impose local conditions with out which it cannot be concretized. Only contingent conditions can individualize inadequate relational forms. Complete or adequate sensitivity, on the contrary, is ipso facto individual or personal, hence in its individuality neutral to conditions. It will be adequate to any possible such conditions, hence can exist in</page><page sequence="19">42 Charles Hartshorne any with its own defining individuality. To be wholly match for this environment is to be potentially match for any possible environment. It remains none the less true that matching one environment is not the same concrete act as matching another. The 'environment' here is an internal one meaning field of operations or relational acts whose terms are fully possessed. Such full possession makes them internal, but does not prevent their being terms and the relations being relations. They are supreme relations. That which is thus supremely related is far from "unmoved" or independent of becoming; it is rather, at all times, unfailingly and adequately moved. Hence its adequacy, its unfailing sensitivity, is unmoved, and is indeed the unmoved mover of all movable things?including God himself as concrete individual. The difference between ordinary and divine relativity can be expressed in many ways. One way is this: God is relative, but what we may call the extent of his relativity is wholly indepen dent of circumstances, wholly non-relative. Regardless of circum stances, of what happens anywhere or when, God will enjoy unrestricted cognitive relativity to all that coexists with him. By contrast, the extent of our human relativity is itself a relative matter, varying with circumstances. It varies all the way from the minimal cognitive relatedness of a man in deep sleep, or the zero cognitive relatedness of a dead man, to the maximal reflec tion of objects in full waking consciousness of a man in perfect condition and mental development. Now there is a difference of logical level between simple relativity, and relativity as to extent and endurance of relativity. God is completely without the latter or second-order relativity in his own character (save in the sense in which the characters of included relata are con tained in the character of the including relative term.) Thus exact analysis shows that we are not obliterating the uniqueness of deity by affirming his relativity. We can even call ours a "negative theology," in that second order relativity, "relativity of relativity," is in this theology denied of deity, though affirmed of all other beings. God is not, it is true, simpliciter "indepen dent," but the generic manner or universal extent of his depend ence is his unique and wholly independent possession. With us,</page><page sequence="20">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 43 the extent of our dependence is also radically dependent, and our very existence as dependent is wholly a matter of chance or contingency. ? 11. The Absolute as Less than God Let us sum up the position we have reached. Medieval and modern realists are right, we have contended, in positing a one sided relativity of subject to object; but the medieval reversal of this relativity in the case of the divine knower is unnecessary and untenable. What is necessary is that, as subject knowing all things, and as immutable absolute, God should not, in every sense, be identically the same entity. Rather, in conceiving God as absolute, we must recognize that we are abstracting from his actual subjectivity or knowing. The Absolute is God with some thing left out of account. God is more than his absolute charac ter. There is no contradiction; for we have defined absolute to mean non-relative, and this meaning does not coincide with that of "all-inclusive" or "supreme." Nor can it mean anything more than the supreme, for that would be nonsense. Accordingly, it can only mean something less than the supremely real, as such. In this we are affirming the contrary of the Hindu doctrine, (rejected by Ramanuja and others), which is sometimes asserted also in the West, that the personal God of worship is a more or less unreal appearance of the absolute. I am arguing that the absolute is, rather, an abstract feature of the inclusive reality which is precisely the personal God. If one must speak of "appear ance," then the absolute, simply as such, may be termed the appearance of ultimate reality to abstract cognition, including the divine self-cognition in its abstract aspect. The absolute is not more, but less, than God?in the obvious sense in which the abstract is less than the concrete. ? 12. Some Absolutistic Arguments In defense of the view that the absolute or independent can be concrete and all-inclusive, it is sometimes said that what in cludes everything cannot depend upon anything, for there is nothing outside itself to depend upon. However, independence</page><page sequence="21">44 Charles Hartshorne of this "nothing" outside the all-inclusive is as little total in dependence as there is absence of rancor in the fact that one does not hate the man in the moon?there being no man in the moon. A whole is not identical with its constituents, and to depend upon constituents is a very real dependence indeed, as we human be ings, with our many-factored bodies, ought to realize, and as medieval thought had the merit of never forgetting. Thus it is truly Pickwickian to guarantee independence on the ground that any dependence must be internal. Change the least item in a totality, and it is not the same totality. If all changeable things are such items, then the totality is of all things the most changeable. The counter-argument that the totality of changes cannot change is not acceptable. For the totality of changes can very well change, by the addition of new changes, previously unactual ized. The objection that the totality of changes must include future changes too is to be met by the question, what could be meant by future change if there is now or eternally a complete totality, never to be increased, of changes? Then nothing new really occurs; everything is as old as eternity and as immutable. The only way to free the idea of time from paradox is to admit, with Bergson, that time is creation, creation of events which exist neither eternally nor at all times but only from and after the time of their creation or occurrence. This means that the totality of events as including a given event is a new totality produced by or coming into being with that event. Another unacceptable argument is that the dependence which absoluteness denies is with respect to something contin gent, and in reality nothing is contingent, everything is necessa ry. But in that case, we should never be able to assert either necessity or contingency, since neither term can have any mean ing save in correlation and contrast with the other. Here we may observe that if all individuals are necessary, then all aggregates are also, that if the concrete is necessary, then so is anything abstract which it contains, so that the only way to permit any application for the indispensable contrasting term, contingent, is to give up the assertion that all individuals are necessary. It is notably otherwise with the assertion that all individuals, say, are subjects. For it would not follow that all aggregates of individu</page><page sequence="22">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 45 als are subjects; an aggregate of individuals need not be an in dividual, in the sense of a well-unified singular, and an aggre gate of subjects certainly need not be a subject. Still more ob vious is it that an abstract aspect of a subject need not be a subject. The very character of subjectivity as such, as an ab straction, is no subject. Thus the argument, often used against any form of idealism, that he who says all individuals are sub jects is depriving the term subject of contrast, hence of meaning, is not a valid argument. But in the case of necessity, it really would destroy all contrast and meaning to assert that every individual or concrete singular is necessary, or, as "absolutists" sometimes do, to assert that there are no individuals save the one necessary one. Another device for justifying the use of language involved in calling absolute?which historically meant independent or non relative?that which is all-inclusive consists in declaring that rela tions are unreal or inconceivable, and since there are no rela tions, the all-inclusive need neither contain nor exclude them. This seems to amount to saying that the relation of appearance and reality?for relations at least appear?is the only relation, and is somehow not really a relation. Further, as Bradley and others admit, if relations are given up, everything thinkable is given up and we are left with the mystic silence. And it would still be true that the all-inclusive at least appears to be the most relative of all things, for it is related to all the appearances of relation, whereas other things are related to but some of them. Still another argument for "absolutism" might be that the absolutely all-inclusive and absolutely independent agree in being?absolute. But note that "absolutely" is an adverb, not an adjective. Note also that absolutely independent is better ex pressed as wholly independent, independent in all relationships. Note finally that one may also speak of the absolutely depen dent, dependent in all relationships. Is it not dangerous to shift from diverse uses of the term absolute in this fashion? Should we not adhere to independent or non-relational as the meaning of the adjective absolute, and employ another word, like all-in clusive, when that is what we mean? And what is to prove that the supreme instance of independence will coincide with the</page><page sequence="23">46 Charles Hartshorne supreme instance of inclusiveness? We have seen that the exact opposite is what we should expect, namely that the all-inclusive will be the least absolute thing there is. ? 13. The Relative as Including the Absolute But, though the all-inclusive cannot, in its inclusiveness, be absolute, yet, since it includes all things, it can perfectly well include something absolute. For to be included is, we have argued, an external relation, a relation of which the included is a term, but not subject. Therefore, the absolute can exist in the supremely relative, in serene independence, serene exemption from relativity. For it is not the absolute which has the relation, "in" the actual relative, but rather and only the relative which has the relation, "containing" the absolute; just as it is the parti cular subject which has the cognitive relation to the object, while the latter is only nominally "in" this relation. And, indeed, since an abstraction cannot actually know, it can only, when we speak of it, be something known, an object. Thus the absolute is a divine object in the divine subject and for the divine subject. It is an essence, not an existence. Nevertheless, it may yet be that God's existence follows from his essence, if by "his exist ence" we mean only that there is some existence embodying the divine essence. For while the object is independent of any parti cular subject, it is not independent of subjectivity as such; just as the abstract is neutral with regard to alternatives of concrete embodiment, but is not neutral to the alternative, some embodi ment or none. That God exists is one with his essence and is an analytic truth (as I hope to show elsewhere), but how, or in what actual state of experience or knowledge or will he exists, is contingent in the same sense as is our own existence. Thus at long last we do justice to the distinction between essence and existence without rendering the truth that there is a divine exist ence a mere contingent fact, subject to accident or possible nulli fication. At long last we can be existentialists in theology, without denying the serene independence of that in God which is bound to be embodied in existence. At long last we can accept theo logically the logical axiom that actuality is of a different logical type from any predicate, but yet maintain that "existence," as</page><page sequence="24">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 47 meaning merely, there is some actual embodiment of the pre dicate, may be necessary. In terms of the principles set forth above, the absolute charac ter of God must be something which is not determinate subject for any object, which is not particular under a universal, or species under a genus, and is not datable as subsequent to any thing. It might seem that it must coincide with pure being, of which these statements are also true. And indeed, God in his absolute character is Being itself, in the sense which abstracts from all particular determinations. The character of omniscience (and other divine attributes, which are mutually equivalent) is no "particular" determination, since it is describable through categories alone. Neither is the character of "world" as such de terminate; for it merely means, whatever is not omniscient. Since the omniscient as such knows whatever else exists, the non omniscient is contained in the omniscient as known in the knower. Thus the form of pure being is the unity of the divine subjectivity (not any actual divine subject) as including the divine objectivity or content as such. This common reference to the divine is a univocal aspect of pure being. But there is also an "analogical" aspect; for the all-knowingness of God is cate gorically diverse from the ignorance of his objects. In terms of the same principles, the surrelative actuality of God is the highest actualized level of concreteness, subject sur veying all actual objects, event subsequent to all actual events not contemporaneous with it. In this aspect, God is not pure being but total actual being of a given moment, with all achieved determinations. Thus God is being in both its opposite aspects, abstract least common denominator and concrete maximal achieved totality. ? 14. Surrelativism and Panentheism Is surrelativism a pantheistic doctrine? Not if this means a doctrine which denies the personality of deity; nor yet if it means that deity is identical with any collection of entities, as such, even the cosmic collection. The total actual state of deity now, as surrelative to the present universe, has nothing outside itself, and in that sense is the All. But the individual essence of</page><page sequence="25">48 Charles Hartshorne deity (what makes God God, or the divine divine) is utterly independent of this All, since any other possible all (and there are absolutely infinite possibilities of different totalities) would have been compatible with this essence. The divine personal essence in this fashion infinitely trancends the de facto totality, and every moment a partly new totality contains and embodies the essence. (We have throughout contended that the "con tained" need not depend on what contains it.) The error of most pantheists has been to deny the externality of concrete existence to the essence of deity. They have not realized that the inclusive actuality of God, which includes all de facto actuality, is just as contingent and capable of additions as the least actuali ty it includes. This is the freedom both of God and of the creatures. For since the essence of God is compatible with any possible universe, we can be allowed some power of decision, as between possibilities, without infringing the absolute independ ence of God in his essential character or personality. And God's own freedom is likewise safeguarded, since freedom means a personal character with which alternative concrete experiences or states are compatible. True, the actual state of deity will be determined partly by the creatures; but this is simply the social character of the divine self-decision, and it is hard to know what to do with opponents who almost in one breath accuse one of an "impersonal" idea of deity and yet object to the admission of social relativity, a basic aspect of personality, in the divine person. If "pantheism" is an historically and etymologically appro priate term for the view that deity is the all of relative or inter dependent items, with nothing wholly independent or in any clear sense non-relative, then "panentheism" is an appropriate term for the view that deity is in some real aspect distinguish able from and independent of any and all relative items, and yet, taken as an actual whole, includes all relative items. Tra ditional theism or deism makes God solely independent or non inclusive. Thus there are logically the three views: God is merely the cosmos, in all aspects inseparable from the sum or system of dependent things or effects; he is both this system and something independent of it; he is not the system, but is in all aspects in dependent. The second view is panentheism. The first view</page><page sequence="26">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 49 includes any doctrine which, like Spinoza's, asserts that there is a premise from which all facts are implied conclusions. A pro position means whatever follows from it, and it is contradictory or meaningless to say that God is independent of all things be cause he necessitates them. Effects imply their causes (whether or not causes do their effects) and what implies particulars is logically on the level of the effect or the dependent, not the independent. Panentheism agrees with traditional theism on the important point that the divine individuality, that without which God would not be God, must be logically independent, that is, must not involve the world. The distinction between individual and state, or personality and experience, enables us to combine this point of theism with the equally necessary point of traditional pantheism that God cannot in his full actuality be less or other than literally all-inclusive. This view is exactly as far from traditional pantheism as from traditional theism, and therefore I suggest it would be ignorance or bad faith to call it pantheism. A suitable term has been proposed (not first by me). I scarcely need to say that surrelativism and panentheism are logically the same doctrine with only a difference of emphasis. One important reason for not giving up the notion that God literally contains the universe is derived from the theory of value. If A contains the value of B and also some additional value, then the value of A exceeds that of B. This is the only assumption that makes "better" self-evident. We overlook this sometimes for the reason that, instead of asking, does this experience (say, of a man) literally include that (say, of an insect), and more besides, we ask rather does the human experience include the abstract species of value imaginable for the insect, while the converse is not true? Thus insect and man have senses, but only man has linguistic symbols and all that they add to experience. Now it is on this route? with some deviations?that people have tried often to conceive the superiority of deity. Not that God literally has our enjoy ments, oh no, not even that he has their abstract equivalents. But he has something better. He has not our form of enjoyment, but he has enjoyment?or "bliss"?on a radically higher level. Just so, thought is superior to sensation. But thought as we know it</page><page sequence="27">50 Charles Hartshorne includes sensation: if it did not, how could thought, or anything, know the superiority of thought? Moreover, we must recognize that if a man is superior to an insect, a world containing insect and man is superior somehow to either alone. Each somehow adds, we feel, to the richness of existence. The reason is that it is only abstractly that human sense is equivalent to the insect's. Concretely there must be some value in insect sensations that we miss. We have something else, as good or better, but neverthe less, a world containing both is better still. I fail to see any well authenticated principle of value that justifies us in assuming a divine instance which, without literal containing of all exper iences, has all their values. It is clear enough that similar remarks ought to be made about the familiar contention that if God is a person he must have other persons "over against" or "outside" of him. If he "has" them, he has them, and that is the meaning of containing. That we "have things outside us" is because we have without having, because we only abstractly enjoy their values, or only with inefficient, faint awareness beyond the reach of introspec tion. Is that the way to conceive God, as similarly failing effective ly to have his relations and their relata? God as personal must have relations and relata, but he must actually and effectively have these. The same criterion proves that in some sense God must be in man. If it is possible to have a distinct idea of man without any awareness of God, then how could God possibly be inferred? And if it is not possible, then surely the being of man includes that of God. It does not effectively include, and hence we do not rival God in value. What we can clearly infer as to God is only his abstract essence, and the wholly abstract is no actual value. The concrete actuality of God is in us only in so far as we, with radical ineffectiveness, or faintness, intuit it. So it is vastly more true to say that we do than that we do not "have" or include God; yet both statements are true. ? 15. Higher Synthesis of Absolutism and Pluralism Our doctrine must partially contradict, not only scholasti cism and nineteenth-century absolute idealism, but also a large</page><page sequence="28">God as Absolute, Yet Related to All 51 majority of the realistic critics of absolutism. These men?for example, William James?apparently thought that if there are external relations, there is no all-inclusive reality. This appears not to follow. For to say that there is something all-inclusive is to say there is something that contains and is thus related to all other things; but from this it cannot be deduced that all other things are related either to the inclusive thing or to each other. True, all are contained, and co-contained, in the inclusive being, but the question is whether this relation of "being contained" or of "being co-contained" is a nominal, external, or a real, in ternal, relation. It must be an external relation; for if the in cluded things have relation to the including thing, then, since "to have the relation is to have the term," they would include the including thing, and all distinction between including and included would vanish. Thus, only if some relations are external, can there, in a significant sense, be an all-inclusive reality! Some at least of the critics of absolutism seem also to have thought that if there are external relations there is nothing absolute, in the sense of independent and immutable. Since in dependent means externally related, this is an odd conclusion to draw. It could only have been drawn because the absolutists had confused together independent?or immutable?with all inclusive, and their critics apparently took their word for the validity of this identification. The existence of external relations does not conflict either with there being something absolute or with there being something inclusive; but it does conflict with the notion that the all-inclusive (which must include relations) can be the absolute. Through this identification absolute ideal ism lost the chance to convey its insight into the inclusiveness of the supreme; just as, through the identification of supremely good and absolute, scholasticism lost the chance to convey its insight into the importance, for theology, of external or nominal relatedness. We must combine the following assertions: the idea of the supreme being connotes absoluteness; it connotes, there fore, external relations; it also connotes relativity, internal rela tions and all-inclusiveness. That this involves no contradiction I have sought to show. Charles Hartshorne University of Chicago.</page></plain_text>
