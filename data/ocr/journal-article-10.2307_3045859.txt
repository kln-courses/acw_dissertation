Pp. xi + 180; 89 black-and-white ills. $27.50 Claude Gandelman, professor of French literature and comparative literature at the universities of Tel Aviv and Haifa, knowledgeable in a number of languages ancient and modern, has produced a rich and imaginative book that passes-sometimes with breathtaking virtuosity-between texts and images.' In twelve extraordinary chapters totaling only 180 pages, he ranges over a vast territory extending from Egyptian imagery to Expressionist distortion, and tackles such apparently heterogeneous topics as the art of Fra 'Among French writers who have cultivated this genre are Claudel, L'Oedzl coute, 1946, and Butor, Les Mots dans la peznture, 1969.

Gandelman is in step with the adoption of Riegl as an important forerunner by semiotic art historians; but he ties Riegl to LUvi-Strauss's structural- ism, and extracts only one aspect from Riegl's complex thought.3 Gandelman suggests ways in which art historians can make use of semiotics, particularly in certain fields; however, his book has limitations, perhaps implying problems that any semiotic approach to art history might have to face. The range of his interest is evident in a summary of the twelve chapters. In chapter one, "Touching with the Eye," Gandelman applies Riegl's dichotomy to a series of cases-an Egyptian hieroglyph of an eye endowed with a human hand, Courbet's hand and eye in The Painter's Studio, and diagrams of scanning eye movements that show both optical and haptical activity. The author then interestingly compares Riegl's visual dichotomy to Jakobson's opposition of metaphoric association (like leaps of the optical) and metonymic association (like fixations of the haptic) in the verbal domain. This provides a bridge to chapter two. Chapter two, "The Gesture of Demonstration," reverses direc- tion: moving this time from the verbal to the visual, the author adapts Austin's "speech act model" to "read" the gesture of the pointing index finger in pre-Renaissance Italian religious paintings. Chapter three, "Penetrating Doors," moves from the explicit gesture of arms to that implied by the framed space of doors (in pictures as well as texts), which Gandelman considers "performa- tive"-the threshold as a "sign of passage" or "liminality."' In this chapter the earlier diagrams of gesturing arms are replaced by a semiotic square (framed like a door and analogous to the old logical square of oppositions), and the "narrative modality of 'to be able to do' " is interpreted in terms of the square. "To be able to pass" means freedom; "to be able not to pass" means independence; "not to be able to pass" means powerlessness; and "not to be able not to pass means obedience."' Gandelman applies the concept of the square to the characters in several paintings (e.g., the man at the threshold of Las Meninas is described as independent, or "able not to pass"), and to the "cognitive modalities of spectators." The half-open door in the left panel of the Master of Flemalle's Annunczation triptych is an instance of the "being able to see" modality: the donor can view the miracle of the central panel. We as spectators "were not meant to see someone who is actually looking at a real object but to watch someone who is having a vision" (p. 45). The chapter ends with a discussion of the semiotics of doors in several novels, concluding with the "terrible liminality" in the work of Kafka,6 thus leading to Gandelman's next subject. Chapter four, "Optics in Extremis," "examines a type of expres- sionist phantasm that is antithetical to the haptic vision" (p. 56). Anorexic figures like the cadaverous Cesare (in Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) or Kafka's hungry artist illustrate Riegl's optical (or Wolfflin's linear) reading of the human body. Taking into account Kafka's tubercular condition and his cultural roots in German Romanticism and Expressionism as well as in the Jewish tradition, the author constructs a semiotic "psychoanalysis" to explain "Kaf- ka's wish to show his father the spectacle of his body" in order to blame him (pp. 61-66). Here, drawing a parallel between the anagram for God and his own-his father's-name (JHVH, KFKA), Gandelman explains Kafka's use of the anagram "K" for his characters as a rebuff to his father expressed through his refusal to bestow on his characters his father's full name.7 The chapter concludes with a parallel between the two-dimensionality of Kafka's space in The Castle and Klee's in The Way to the City Castle, both of which have vectors leading nowhere. Chapter five, "Toeing the Line," discusses a short story published in Russia in 1923 by Babel that demonstrates "that line and outline are all-important as aesthetic elements" (p. 73). The author asserts that the "optical/haptical dichotomy" in the story "corresponds not only to a conflict between political ideologies but also to a conflict between aesthetic viewpoints" (p. 70). (He notes that with Lenin's death and the advent of Stalin the formalist tendency of Babel and others had to be eliminated.) Chapter six, "Homunculus as Map," is centered on the haptic, the "self-representation on the cortex": "the cortex contains a diagram of its own body image, ... a stunted and deformed homunculus" (p. 74). There are asides on a caricature of Pius IX showing a "phrenological map inside the papal brain" (pp. 76-77); and its source in the 16th-century mannerist Arcimboldo is compared to the frontispiece of Hobbes's Levzathan (called the Commonwealth). This is all a prelude to a discussion of maps, an expansion of points made by Foucault.8 Chapter seven, "Bodies, Maps, Texts," concerns the making of "anthropomorphic maps," "chiefly of the female body" (the "anthropo" is meant generically)-in both texts and images (paint- ings of Ernst and Masson, a "Zodiac man"). The "case" of the sexually anthropomorphic cartography of Opicinus de Canistris in the 14th century is discussed (pp. 84-85): the psychoanalyst Kris called him psychotic; but Gandelman finds parallels in the work of Dante, John Donne, and Arcimboldo, and follows Opicinus's biogra- pher Salomon, who "found nothing psychopathological in his cartographic procedure."' The author then passes from "the map as text" (the conceit of love maps explicitly in the texts of Mlle. de Scudry and Donne and implicitly in those of Baudelaire) to the text as map (the "topographic-linguistic" shapes embedded in Finnegans 2 The American editor on the whole served the author's erudition well; however, some misspellings do occur, notably in the field of art history; e.g.: Spaetromanzsche Kunstzndustrie (p. ix) for Riegl's Die spdtromische Kunstzndustrze, which is called on p. 162, n. 19, Die Spaetantique Kunstzndustrze; (p. 169, n. 8) "Theme-Becker, Allgemezner Lexzkon" has two mistakes; (p. 174, n. 5)... kunstklerzsche.... 3 H. Damisch's Thiorze du nuage, 1972, also follows Riegl's tactile/optic dichotomy, and is concerned with the semiotics of clouds, mainly Baroque ones. However Damisch, an art historian, applies the literature of art history more knowledgeably than Gandelman. 4 On p. 51 he writes: Velaisquez's "Menznas is about the liminal situation represented by the concept of posing for a painter... about painting as liminal death-giving through the glance of the painter: he freezes his actors in a pose and then freezes their life, their own regard, on the canvas for eternity." 5 The author, who emphasizes the glances of the figures here and in chapter twelve, might have cited Riegl's pioneering Das hollandzsche Gruppenportrat, 1902, which links the glances and actions of the figures to the spatial composition. 6 The author makes use of the semiotic square somewhat like Jameson in The Polztzcal Unconsczous, 1982, a book footnoted elsewhere. ' One should add that Freud discussed this very example of YHVH as a taboo similar to the concealment of names in dreams and associations. See "The Significance of Sequences of Vowels" (191 1), Standard Edztion, xII, 341. For a psychoanalytic interpretation of writing and reading, see M. Klein, "The Role of the School in the Libidinal Development of the Child," Contrzbutzons to Psychoanalysis: 1921-45, London, 1948, 73-74. One of Klein's cases relevant to Kafka involved sexualized fantasies about letters. 8 Gandelman could have cited Foucault, chap. two, "La Prose du monde," Les Mots et les choses, Paris, 1966, 37: "Le corps de l'homme est la moiti, possible d'un atlas universel." 9 Unfortunately the author relied solely on Salomon's first article and ignored his later amendments. Salomon later discovered a new manu- script by Opicinus unknown to Kris, and published it in 1953; and he then cites Kris's article, noting that indications of some "mental disturbance are evident even to the medically untrained reader."

Chapter eight, "The Scatological Homunculus," discusses the excremental subject matter that proliferated after the Revolution of 1789, reaching a peak in 1790-92. Gandelman notes that "these images do not fit into the customary headings provided by scholars of art history" (p. 94); and armed with his semiotic approach, he asks, "what does the omnipresence of this scatology in the imagery of the French Revolution signify? Can it yield clues to the meaning of the revolution?" Caricatures showing the king as impotent (representing him metonymically as a limp penis enthroned), defecations on or by the king and nobles, purging, and spanking abound in the imagery of the sans culottes. The prerevolutionary "iconographic filiation" (p. 99) of this pictorial scatology goes back to Rabelais (Bakhtin's point), but can also be found in Lutheran caricatures (p. 103) showing, for example, the "birth" of monks through the devil's anus. The author explores the "meaning" of this scatology (pp. 105ff) in terms of the materialist notion of "man as a shitting and fucking machine" and of the carnival spirit of "the upside down." He sees the scatology as an "antif~te" that comple- mented or supplemented the somberly official fete rivolutionnazre, whose "deeper significance" he discovers by linking "the analogy face = behind" to Freud's case study, "A Mythological Parallel to a Visual Obsession." In that case a young man was obsessed by the word Vater-arsch accompanied by the image of his father's face as a behind, a condensation Freud explained as irreverence toward his father the Patriarch. The chapter concludes with a psycho-historical explanation of the role of scatology as political propaganda that provides a rationale for revolutionary violence.'0 In chapter nine, "Haptics in Extremis," Gandelman asks the source of the theme of self-flaying in the Expressionist Kokoschka's Morder, Hoffnung der Frauen, and traces the motif back to the Mannerists: "Sixteenth-century man, who had lived through the terrible sacking of Rome in 1527 and the no less horrible religious wars, apparently found pleasure in seeing his interior mechanism laid bare" (pp. 111-112). But art itself is a sadomasochistic "self-flaying: that is what is revealed by Marsyas's terrible scream in Ovid's Metamorphoses" (p. 115) and by Michelangelo's flayed self-portrait in the Sistine Last Judgment. In discussing the theme in literature, the author turns from Whitman who put "flaying ... at the service of generous egali- tarian ideas" (pp. 117-118) to Expressionist examples comparable to Kokoschka's: In the Penal Colony of Kafka with its "understanding of the profoundly ambivalent and reversible nature of the artist ... at once flayer and flayed" (p. 118f); and The Magzc Mountazn of Mann. "After Expressionism" (pp. 123-127) looks at the Surrealists Bufiuel, Dali, and Magritte, as well as Nabokov and Francis Bacon, who found "a terrible beauty" in dead and bleeding flesh. After an excursus on the "Mexican Tradition" of the flayed god, Gandelman states: ". . . as we shall see in the next chapter, it is haptic qualities that are demanded of the present-day observer, whom we might call a 'deconstructionist spectator': to probe with one's eyes not the surface but the texture, and beneath the texture" (p. 130). Chapter ten, "Peeling Off Skins," follows the hermeneutics of the 17th-century Jesuit M6nestrier, who explains that "Apollo, the god of poetry, was painted in the act of flaying Marsyas precisely 'to teach the proper way to skin the Fables, that is, to discover the meaning that they contain' " (p. 131). Gandelman derives M6nestri- er's interpretation from the Christian fourfold exegetical system (literal, allegorical, homiletic, and anagogic), which he relates to the "Jewish tradition" (in its turn a prefiguring of Kafka's In the Penal Colony). Gandelman here presents a dazzling array of metaphors of peeling in maps and in palimpsests ("substitute skins"), which he finds in Surrealist painting (Magritte and Ernst), in a 17th-century Vanztas, Giotto's Last Judgment, Jasper Johns, Pollock, and political journalism (the image of the fallen Shah of Iran as a torn-off poster). Literary examples range from Borges to E.T.A. Hoffmann, Ray- mond Queneau, and Derrida whose "deconstructionist endeavor" came closest "to a Dionysian flaunting of the text as 'skin' " (pp. 139-140). With Derrida no content other than the skin (the text) remains: "What you see through a haptical apprehension of the text is what you get." Chapter eleven, "Reading Order and Disorder," examines "the parallelism between textual and visual art works from the point of view of the order/disorder dichotomy-specifically, entropy versus order or randomness and noise versus order." Gandelman's semi- otic approach makes allowance for the linguistic dimension without becoming entangled in the issue of whether pictures can contain verbal content," and without broaching the old criticism leveled by literary history at art history.'" Ocular proximity, analogue of the haptic, is seen to promote disorder, except in the cases of the Renaissance anamorphosis (p. 142, Holbein's Ambassadors) and the intended non-finzto (p. 143, based on the discredited notion of Michelangelo's "passion for the uncompleted"). Verbal proximity that yields "noise" in literature follows the example of Sterne's Trzstram Shandy in depending on the visual-the "collage" of texts like those of Joyce, Proust, Stein, Dos Passos, and Apollinaire. Impressionism provided another "haptic vision" that entered liter- ary theory through the phenomenological doctrine of Ingarden (p. 147f) and his concepts of "indetermination" and of the surface of the literary text as "a sort of chaos, the equivalent of an impression- ist or pointillist disorder." Concrete poetry (Gandelman's example is by the German semiotician Bense), introduced "at the very moment when the game hyle/morph&amp;, matter/form. .. had become impossible" offers a "new aesthetic [that] asked the reader to start reading order as disorder and disorder as order" (p. 149). Chapter twelve, "Oculocentrism and Its Discontents," displaces the emphasis of Derrida's (postmodern) logocentrism onto "oculocentrism," and presents the thesis that "death is at the very core and center of sight" (p. 150f). After illustrating the point with examples from the Renaissance (arrows "blinding" the eye) to Surrealism (Bufiuel and Dali's slicing of a woman's eye; Magritte's detached female eye; Bataille's Hzstozre de l'oeil, which confuses sex as phallus and as vulva), Gandelman quotes the speculation of An- thony Burgess in Clockwork Orange that the evil eye of a prostitute "is a phallic gesture or symbol-the power of male generation against female destruction." He applies the latter to Bataille's Histozre: "vision in woman is a phallic thrust . . . (I)n the dark fonts of the collective psyche, may be found a deeper layer in which the 'female' eye and the 'male' index finger are implacable enemies" (p. 157). He sums up the issues involved in terms of the "scopic function" of Lacan (whom he links to Surrealism). "Lacan, not Freud, [formu- lated] the equation eye = sex.... It is through the eye that one enters the realm of what Lacan calls 'the Imaginary' as opposed to 'the Symbolic,' which is more the realm of language." Two examples are drawn from Lacan: the study of Poe's "Purloined Letter," in which "'a gigantic woman body' could not be perceived by the castrated eye"; and the anamorphosis of the skull in The Ambassa- dors, which evokes for Lacan "'the effect of an erection.' " Thus, "seeing is both an erotic sexual pulsion and a passage into death, its apparent opposite": "Lacan's oculocentrism is a thanatocentrism." 'o Gandelman repeatedly analyzes corporal metaphors, some of them monstrous, that result from the joining of body parts (hand/eye, father/behind, king/penis); these examples belong among those cited by E.L. Curtius, whose chapter "Corporal Metaphors," in European Lzterature and the Latzn Middle Ages [1948], New York, 1953, discusses such daring images as Plato's "eye of the soul" and Saint Augustine's "hand of the heart." " Gombrich insists that "a picture is never a statement," whereas some philosophers of language maintain that pictures can serve as vehicles of "propositional truth"; e.g., S. Kjorup, "George Inness and The Battle of Hastings, or Doing Things with Pictures," Monzst, LVIII, 1974, 225, developed a "philosophy of pictorial languages," whose task is "to find, define, and maybe even name the different pictorial speech acts that we are capable of performing today. ." 12 Cf. Curtius (as in n. 10), 14: "European literature ... has an autonomous structure, which is essentially different from that of the visual arts"; and he specifically denied the value of art history (especially meaning Wolfflin's principles) for the study of literary history.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 171 Useful applications of semiotics to art history like Gandelman's recall Warburg's openness to far-ranging subject matter, especially in marginal areas offensive to a connoisseur's sensibility-with one important difference: the very notion of marginality has lost its point of application in the decentered world of poststructuralism. Through semiotics Gandelman can show the relevance of seemingly remote fields in the psychology of perception, body image, and, of course, linguistics, to the study of Western art from Egypt on. The drawings of major writers (one thinks of Hugo, Malraux, and others), usually of little intrinsic interest, could take on a new significance through semiotic interpretation; and, viewing great historic events like the French Revolution through a semiotic lens, as Gandelman does, could enable scholars to make sense of scatological material often neglected by historians of the period. Certainly, the production of some visual material during critical moments can be studied with profit through synchronic "slices" independent of historical sequence or influence; but that amounts to what one might term a prehistoric analysis: art historians would still wish to emend the flatness of his treatment by adding a third dimension of history, and "context."13 Gandelman's book implicitly raises the crucial issue of the relation between the diachronic discipline of history and his rather atemporal synchronic method.'4 He touches on the problem of their interaction when he translates the Freudian "deeper significance" of a text into Levi-Straussian terms (his study of interpretations of the myth of Oedipus as a series of frames overlaying one another) as a metaphorical flaying along what amounts to a temporal axis. Gandelman may here have taken over Riegl's obsolete notion in implying the existence of a present-day deconstructionist Zeztgezst.15 Apart from the problem of making sense of the passage from one historical plateau to another (the controversial notion of historical "explanation"), this approach raises the issue of continuity and discontinuity within and between styles, a problem discussed in Kubler's important book The Shape of Tzme (1962). Certain problems left out of his book still motivate much of the productive work in an art history largely dedicated to concrete objects:16 why do historical events like the Reformation stimulate form changes such as distor- tion, flattening, or color intensity, analogous to changes in other periods like the early Middle Ages or the modern period? What impact do historical situations (patronage, form of the commission, means of production and distribution) have on the criterion of "originality" (the acceptable production of copies in medieval workshops; the insistence on "originality" and invention in the period of commodity productions of the early 20th century)?" Gandelman's neglect of history is more keenly missed in the discussions of earlier periods than in those of the 20th century. His neglect of history entails other limitations. His synchronic ap- proach, like that of the old structuralists before Derrida and Foucault, considers language (and by extension art) at any given moment as a unified field independent of its history. This opens wide the door to metaphoric leaps in time, and he seems to perform a semiotic rhapsody on the themes of the visual objects he discusses, as in the first chapter, which moves without much transition (a bit like a basic art appreciation text) from the Egyptian Wajat-eye to Courbet's eye and hand in The Painter's Studzo. The familiar notion of periods returns, complete with their reification.'8 And the "dichotomous" or bipolar approach to periods borrowed from Riegl (invalidated along with general terms like "art" and "beauty" by Wittgenstein's concept of "family resemblances") hardly stimulates the study of historical development." Gandelman's similar neglect of history-his wish to make politi- cal caricature (p. x) "a sort of exposition and revelation of the political humunculus within us," for example, and his assertion (p. xi) that "the image of the uncontrollable body ... is always in the Hzntergrund of political, historical, and aesthetic discourse"-seems linked to a major "political" lapse in his studies: he nowhere mentions the feminist viewpoint that has covered much the same ground as his book (the gaze, the discourse of the body).20 Gandel- man's Foucaultian notion that "there is a discourse of the body ... behind political discourse," or that "body representation directs political discourse" (p. xi) supports his belief in the autonomy of discourses about art.2' Whatever problems Gandelman's book contains, however, its ability to stimulate specific discussions of art and its history, and its presentation of alternative approaches to certain problems within the domain of art history, establish its value, and abundantly warrant the attention of art historians. JACK J. SPECTOR Rutgers University New Brunswzck, N.J. 08903 13 "Context," although controversial for some semioticians, is still a current term in many fields, including political theory and developmen- tal psychology. M. Bal and N. Bryson, "Semiotics and Art History," Art Bulletzn, LXXX, 2, 1991, would eliminate the term from art history, displacing it into "intertexuality" and "framing." They prefer to speak of the social and historical "situation." 14 Gandelman's biological model of the eye, like other synchronic models, tends to ignore the changing human cultural context, and is static and atemporal. One wonders whether this stasis is associated with his choice of the semiotic diagram in the form of a square or rectangle. 15 He knows that Riegl-a post-Hegelian and pre-W61fflinian- construed the haptic/optic dichotomy in historical terms, claiming that the style of every period evolves from the optic to the haptic (p. 11). 16 For good examples of current scholarship, see the June 1991 issue of The Art Bulletzn-the same issue in which Bal and Bryson's survey of new semiotic approaches engages some of these problems. Whereas Gandel- man's semiotic approach sometimes leads him to neglect the art (as in his preoccupation with blindness and the invisible), his approach at other times admits the concreteness of the visual object, though without much concern for issues of connoisseurship, provenance, or dating. 17 The "Postmodern" assault on modernist originality actually dates from Dada and Surrealism, avant-garde movements already opposed to both modernism and originality. 18 Gandelman produces a veritable collage of historical moments, with a similar discontinuity of space and time: The "eye-touch concept" found in ancient Egypt is said to "reemerge in a picture by Courbet" (p. 1). And on the next page, he writes, "The eye-touch concept had several revivals in the trajectory described by aesthetic developments leading to French realism." 19 He says that "Mannerism was influenced by the development of emblems and indeed was perhaps the style in which emblematic activity reached its apex" (p. 4). Mannerism and emblems appear to be reified vehicles of influence. For a critique of the usefulness of "periods," see H.P.H. Teesing, Das Problem der Perzoden in der Lzteraturgeschzchte, Groningen, 1949. 20 Cf., e.g., Kristeva's development and critique of Lacan's theory of the Imaginary and the Symbolic. While aware of the mixing of genres and modes of representation, Gandelman does not notice that the "crossover" phenomenon he discusses (work that oscillates between art and litera- ture and between genders) is basic to the work of feminists and homosexual theorists; moreover, he adopts without comment the "dichotomous" mode of Riegl and LUvi-Strauss, which fits his synchronic method well, but which feminists like Margaret Iversen have criticized as patriarchal. See her "Saussure vs. Peirce: Models for a Semiotics of Visual Art," in The New Art History, ed. A.L. Rees and F. Borzello, London, 1986, 82ff. 21 This belief reminds one of the autonomous spheres of art, science, and morality discussed by Habermas following Max Weber. Semioticians in the Prague circle (1926-) took an opposite view: cf. Mukarovsky's "L'Art comme fait semiologique" (1934) for art as the dialectical transforma- tion of the "immanence" and "autonomy" of the artwork into social, cultural, and historical productions: "The work of art bears the character of a sign. It can be identified neither with the individual state of consciousness of its creator nor with any such states in its perceiver, nor with the work as artifact. The work of art exists as an 'aesthetic object' located in the consciousness of an entire community." This is consistent both with Peirce, whose "pragmatics" connected semiotics to practice, and with Wittgenstein, who argued that words have meaning dependent on the speech community in which they function. Even without the old notion of authority or intentionality, the art historian can rewardingly describe the community's artistic (and linguistic) practices-a project not unlike that of cultural anthropologists (Gandelman himself alludes to L[vi-Strauss and Victor Turner).</page></plain_text>
