HANSON HARVARD UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 WO major problems stand in the background as we approach the text of 1 Enoch 6-11: (1) the problem of defining genres such as midrash and targum in relation to compositions like Jubilees, the Genesis Apocryphon, Pseudo-Philo and 1 Enoch, and (2) the problem of clarifying the relation of such works to the phenomenon of Jewish apocalypticism. These two problems will not be discussed abstractly, nor will we attempt to produce comprehensive definitions. Rather they will be brought into focus from within the particulars of these six chapters of Enoch, thereby casting, hopefully, some new light on the larger issues as well. With regard to the question of genre, in the case of 1 Enoch 6-11, several alternatives must be considered. Its introduction takes the form of a paraphrase of Gen 6:1 resembling, even in several details, the Targum Pseudo- Jonathan. This raises the question of whether 1 Enoch 6-11 can be described as a targum. Though other verses similarly paraphrase Genesis, however, the bulk of 1 Enoch 6-11 strays too far beyond the biblical text to be considered a targum, even of the expansive Pseudo-Jonathan variety. Philip S. Alexander offers the next alternative: "I Enoch 6-11 is an elaborate midrash of Gen 6:1-4."1 As we shall observe, this passage shares many of the features of midrash, including quotations from the biblical text, application through exposition of that text to contemporary theological problems, and correlation of the basic text to other scriptural passages applying the principle of scripture interpreting scripture.2 If, however, we measure this passage against another criterion which is widely held, namely, that the midrash exists to aid in interpreting the intrinsic meaning of the text, we encounter difficulties. 1 Enoch 6-11 announces the destruction of the created order, though the God of the Torah had promised never again to destroy his creation; moreover, that destruction is tied to a repetition of the deluge, though God in Gen 8:11 covenanted never again to evoke the destructive force of the flood to obliterate all flesh. A pattern influenced by the Endzeit wird Urzeit of ancient myth is being imposed upon the biblical text IP, S. Alexander, 'The Targumim and Early Exegesis of 'Sons of God' in Genesis 6," JJS 23 (1972) 60. 2Addison G. Wright, "The Literary Genre Midrash," CBQ 28 (1966) 105-38, 417-57. 195</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE which strains the usual exegetical function of midrash. Thus the objections raised by Joseph Fitzmyer in his second edition of the Genesis Apocryphon to calling that work a midrash apply even more emphatically here.3 A third alternative arises in comparing these chapters to Hellenistic ethnographic historical works, especially those emanating from Alexandria. The practice of beginning an ethnic history in primordial times was widespread,4 and is a mere extension of a practice extending from the Sumerian King list to Berossos and Manetho, a practice which had already left its imprint on J and P in the Pentateuch. This impression is strengthened through comparison with Jubilees, Pseudo-Philo, and later church historians like Eusebius and Africanus. In fact, we see clearly from Syncellus' adaptation of I Enoch 6-11 how easily our chapters were drawn into such an historiographic work. But precisely the comparison with Syncellus raises strictures blocking this third alternative: Firstly, the scope of Syncellus's work is much broader, with the antediluvian story serving as a mere introduction to a longer history; secondly, regarding detail, Syncellus made alterations in the Enoch text to suit the genre of history-writing, such as the chronological detail in 7:1: ". . . in the 1170th year of the world . . ." In relation to historical writings, whether from Alexandria in the second century B.C.E., or from the early Christian historians, it must be noted that while dogmatic tendencies certainly are discernible in them, they are primarily historical in focus, whereas in 1 Enoch 6-11 the historical content is utterly subservient to a theological message. Elimination of these three alternatives seems to leave us without a simple literary category for 1 Enoch 6-11. The full implications of this observation must be drawn: We should stop treating intertestamental literature as slavishly derivative from OT categories on the one hand, or as identical with NT and rabbinic forms on the other. The categories which scholars have attempted to force upon compositions like 1 Enoch 6-11 represent either earlier or later developments. Form-critical analysis of intertestamental literature must desist in the common practice of applying ideal models derived from other periods to these works. Instead, a functional model of genres should be adopted which moves inductively from the compositions themselves to literary types.5 A relation does seem to exist between 1 Enoch 6- 11 and all three of the genres mentioned, but this relation must be understood historically and not categorically, for 1 Enoch 6-11 is an early type of expository narrative combining elements which later were differentiated into the separate genres of targum, haggadic midrash, and Jewish ethnographic historiography. 3Joseph Fitzmyer, The Genesis Apocryphon of Qumran Cave I: A Commentary (BibOr 18A; Rome: Biblical Institute, 19712). 4E.g., Eupolemos, Artapanus, and note how the form was adopted in Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus. 5In this connection the newly organized project sponsored by the SBLto study the "Forms and Genres of Religious Literature in Late Antiquity" is very promising. 196</page><page sequence="3">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN Against this general background, we turn to 1 Enoch 6-11, to which we provisionally assign the general designation, expository narrative. In this expository narrative, Gen 6:1-4 specifically (and in a broader sense, Gen 4-10) is interpreted from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology.6 The implicit hermeneutical principal is typological: the primordial events of fall and judgment described in scripture also describe the approaching eschaton, when the unrighteous among angels and humans will be judged and punished, and the elect will be delivered to inherit a life of blessedness. The tradition as we have received it in the Gizeh Greek and the Ethiopic manuscripts leaves traces of internal development, a process of growth which was carried on by later historians like Syncellus. The core seems to have been the narrative about Semihazah, which was subsequently amplified with an episode concerning the punishment of Azazel and with materials developing an euhemeristic theme. I. The Semihazah Narrative as Exposition of Gen 6:1-4 1 Enoch 6-11 as we have received it results from growth around a narrative core which is recovered through removal of the following verses: 7: lde, 8:1-3; 9:6, 8c; 10:4-10. Manuscript evidence from Qumran, which indicates that chapters 1-1 1 were in their present form by the middle of the second century B.C.E.,7 when correlated with the literary critical observation that these chapters are the result of a growth process, leads us to extrapolate a date of composition for the Semihazah stratum of 1 Enoch 6-11 somewhere in the third century B.C.E. When considering the additions to the core, we will see that the relation between these strata is organic, with a common perspective (apocalyptic eschatology), and a common hermeneutical principle (there exists a typological relation between primordial events and endtime events) being manifested throughout. As an expository narrative, the Semihazah story weaves themes and motifs of Gen 4-10 into the following structure:8 Background note: Sons of Heaven and Daughters of Earth (6:1-2a). (1) Plot of rebellion by astral deities in heaven and their descent (6:2b-8). (2) Sexual commingling, birth of giants, devastation caused by the giants, earth's plea (7:1 - 6; 8:4 [minus 7:lde] ). (3) Angelic intercession before the Most High, deliverance of Noah, and punishment of the rebels and their offspring who are bound and cast to earth, ultimately to be punished in the fiery abyss (9:1-10:15 [minus 9:6, 8c, and 10:4-10]). (4) Restoration of the Kingship of the Most High and of Cosmic Order (10:16-11:2). The result is a complete mythic pattern around the theme of rebellion-in- heaven, and consisting of four movements: rebellion, devastation, punishment, restoration. 6For a definition of this term and related categories, see the author's articles "Apocalypse" and "Apocalypticism" in IDBSup, pp. 27-34. 7J.

Milik, who argues for the chronological priority of this section of 1 Enoch over the Genesis text, "Problemes," HTR 64 (1971) 349. 197</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The first verse supplies background to the myth by means of a close paraphrase of the Genesis text, much in the style of a targum.9 Since similar paraphrases introduce other sections of this composition as well, it seems that the intended purpose is to invoke scriptural authority for the exposition, an important function, since the other devices commonly used in this period to establish authority, the pseudonym and the apocalypse, are not applied here. The words of God and his archangels in this passage thus receive an authoritative aura through this anchorage in scripture. Obviously, affinities exist here with both the targum and the haggadic midrash. But succeeding sections of the exposition go far beyond the license even of the most expansionary targums, and break the usual restraints of the midrash by going far beyond exposition of the meaning of the text, in what amounts to a radical transformation of its essential message. V 2a completes the background section through a somewhat freer paraphrase which gives an important interpretive gloss identifying the bene ha'elhim as heavenly beings (oi aggelou uioi ouranou, Eth. mald'ekt weluda samayat).10 This places the passage within an early exegetical tradition which was repressed among Jewish interpreters (and later in Christian circles as well) after R. Simeon b. Yohai (middle second century) who sought to remove an offensive note by insisting that the bene hdaelohim were mere men. Further amplification of the text makes the sexual connotation explicit: "And lusted after them." Thus, this paraphrase of Gen 6:1-2a tersely supplies the background for the following drama: Heaven and earth are two separate realms, each inhabited by beings natural to them. But a rebellious inclination leads certain heavenly beings to contemplate transgressing this separation, ominously threatening the created order with disharmony and disruption. 1. Plot of Rebellion by Astral Deities in Heaven and Their Descent (6:2b- 8). The first movement in the myth is introduced by the transformation of Gen 9The Aramaic fragments from Qumran (to be published by J. Milik), corroborate earlier scholarly conjecture that the original language of this material was Aramaic. As we observe later as well, in various parts of 1 Enoch 6-11, the question of the relation between this writing and the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan is raised by demonstrable affinities which exist between the two (cf., Arthur Marmorstein, Studien zum Pseudo-Jonathan Targum I. Das Targum unddie apokryphe Literature [Pressburg: Alkalay, 1905]). In this verse, the expansion "beautiful and comely" is matched by ?pyrth in Pseudo-Jonathan (similarly Pseudo- Philo). In vv 1-6, our textual evidence is enriched by a Syriac fragment preserved in Michael the Syrian's Chronicle (see S. P. Brock JTS 19 [1968] 626-31). '0This early exegetical tradition is attested by the Old Greek (where the reading of oi uioi tou theou is found [A has oi aggeloi tou theou over an erasure], even as in the Vulgate, Peshitta and Pseudo-Philo [Lab]), by the marginal gloss in Neofiti, probably by Pseudo-Jonathan (the etymology supplied for hannepilim in v 4 strongly suggests that the bene rabrebayyad of v 2 is a correction to the later orthodox position), as well as various Christian writers (Pseudo-Clement, Commodianus, Tertullian, Lactantius, and Clement of Alexandria). The polemic against the angelology of this exegetical tradition becomes widespread after R. Simeon, who, like Neofiti, has bny dyynhy (Symmachus: oi ouoi ton dunasteuonton [closely related to the Samaritan Pentateuch's bny sltnyh], and the Christian writers Julius Africanus, Chrysostom, and Augustine [cf. R. H. Charles, The Book of Enoch (Oxford: Clarendon, 1912) and P. S. Alexander, "The Targumim" (63-4). In Onkelos bene ha'elohim is translated bny rbrby'. 198</page><page sequence="5">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN 6:2b into the first person narrative of the rebels, which has the effect of heightening the dramatic tone. That their premeditated act constitutes nothing less than rebellion against the King of Heaven is clear on several accounts: (1) The mixed procreation transgresses the separation of heaven and earth; (2) Semihazah expresses his fears regarding "the penalty of great sin"; (3) the formality of the oath procedure bespeaks the gravity of the act; (4) Mount Hermon is one of the cosmic mountains, and hence descent upon it by the rebellious angels symbolizes an attack on the Divine King enthroned thereupon (the direction of attack by the rebels in the various versions of the rebellion-in-heaven myth, whether up or down or lateral, is fluid).ll These themes are developed through pure elaboration of the Genesis text which utilizes two techniques popular in later haggadic midrash. Firstly, the unnamed angels of the bible are counted, named and ordered: They are two hundred in number, their leader is Semihazah, and the names of 2012 chiefs of ten are listed. Secondly, fanciful etymologizing develops the roots yrd (Gen 5:18), hrm, and hassem (Gen 6:4), with the result that the angels descend in the days of Yared on Mount Hermon under the leadership of Semihazah and bind themselves by mutual oath. This triple etymologizing functions within the Enochian exposition to establish emphatically the culpability of the heavenly beings: their act of rebellion was premeditated, and therefore they must fall under the wrath of the Most High. 2. Sexual Commingling, Birth of Giants, Devastation Caused by the Giants, Earth's Plea (7:1-6 [minus 7:lde]; 8:4). The narrative returns to a close paraphrase of Genesis by way of introducing the second movement, 1 Enoch 7:1 abc corresponding to Gen 6:2b. In addition eisporeusthaipros autas (Eth. yeba'u habehon) renders yb'w l' bnwt of Gen 6:4, with an added verb to underscore the sexual defilement involved. A rebellious and unnatural act of rebellion against the Most High has pernicious and grotesque results: "and they became pregnant, and they bore great giants" (7:2a). A link is thereby strengthened which was already found in 6:2, resting upon an interpretation accepted by most interpreters, ancient and modern, that the nepllitn of Gen 6:4 are those beings sired by the divine beings who took to themselves the daughters of men in Gen 6:2. Following this grounding of the second movement in the biblical text (the device for invoking scriptural authority alluded to above), the narrative again elaborates the Genesis text, first by accentuating the size of the giants, then by describing the devastation which they cause. All focuses on one underlying message: rebellion against the order of the Most High unleashes the forces of chaos. This message is again rooted in scripture by drawing upon Gen 6:5-12 and 8:2 to specify one aspect of the devastation, the defilement of the created order lISee 1 Enoch 13:7-8, noting the archaic themes of the Mount as source of waters, place of judgement (dn) and theophany; cf. T. Levi 2:5-6 (for the identification of the mountain with Hermon, cf. J. Milik, "Le Testament de Levi en Arameen," RB 62 [1955] 403-404), Ps 133:3 (Hermon/Zion), and Judg 3:3 and 1 Chr 5:23 (Ba'al Hermon). '2This list is unstable in the versions, both in terms of morphology and length. 199</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE extending from humankind to birds to beasts to reptiles. This, in biblical metaphor, is a description of the collapse of the order of creation, with pugnacious forces unleashed in a vicious process of degeneration and decay. Almost as an involuntary response to the defilement arises the cry of the earth and its perishing inhabitants (7:6 and 8:4, now separated by the interpolation of euhemeristic material). Biblical allusions are again recognizable, with 7:5c referring to the defiling practice of drinking blood prohibited in Gen 9:4 and with the cry of humankind which went up to heaven in 8:4 freely paraphrasing the words of Gen 4:10: q1l deme 'ahika so'dqim 'elay min-ha'dddma. 3. Angelic Intercessions, Divine Deliverance of Noah, and Punishment of Rebels and Their Offspring (9:1-10:15 [minus 9:6, 8c, and 10:4-10]). As the first and second movements of the drama were introduced by a paraphrase of the text of Genesis, in like manner the third movement is introduced, with 9:1 freely paraphrasing Gen 6:12. The earlier Genesis version preserves this theme in slightly different form, with the deity himself looking upon the earth and beholding the corruption, whereas the deanthropomorphizing tendency of the Second Temple Period explains the substitution of angelic mediators in the Enoch text. The expositional technique of amplification once again follows upon the heels of this anchorage in the biblical text, for the angelic intercession is prefaced with a hymnic introduction with parallels in the intertestamental literature.13 Typical of the theology of the period is the stress upon the Most High's foreknowledge.'4 Divine cognizance of the devastation wrought by the rebels leads to an incisive double-edged response: deliverance of faithful Noah, punishment of the rebels. The former is stated tersely through a free paraphrase of Gen 6:13, once again with the Most High acting through angelic mediation. The instruction at this point breaks out of the time framework of the myth by referring proleptically beyond the flood of primordial antiquity: "Instruct [Noah] that he may escape, and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world." This typological dimension characterizes the entire remaining section of the narrative, which lays emphasis upon the "left hand" of the divine response, punishment of the rebels. Punishment of the rebels is equivalent to a battle offensive initiated by the King of Heaven who is aided by his divine allies (e.g., Sariel and Michael). The methods of punishment are ones commonly found in mythological texts developing the theme of rebellion in heaven: binding, inciting panic (slaying of one another), being thrown down to earth, being cast into the torment and imprisonment in the fiery abyss. Such was the punishment ordered for the rebels and their offspring. In all of this, the narrative goes far beyond the 13E.g., 1 QapGen 20:12-7 (the prayer of Abram), and 2 Bar 21:4-11 (the prayer of Baruch; note here the same theme and function as in 1 Enoch 9). We note also in passing that at the point just before the flood in Berossos, Xisouthros explains that he is going away in order to intercede to the gods for humans: euchomenon anthropois agatha genesthai.

To be sure, this episode is also first rooted in the Genesis text by making the deluge its point of departure. But the binding of the enemy, the panic, the casting to earth, and imprisonment in the abyss draw upon a mythological complex which is not found in Genesis. An account can be given for its source only by a broader investigation into the pre-Enochian history of the rebellion-in-heaven mythic pattern, which we defer to the next section of this paper. As in the case of the deliverance of Noah, in the description of the punishment of the rebels the thrust of the narrative is from the primordial to the eschatological: "And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from henceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations. And destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because they have wronged mankind. Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end. ..." (10:14-16a). The entire myth is thereby reoriented from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology. The primordial drama is used to account for the sum total of evil in this world, since that evil is derived from the gigantic offspring generated by the heavenly rebels. The ultimate skirmish in that heavenly battle will involve the final eradication of all evil through the destruction of "the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers." This is not exactly the pattern Endzeit wird Urzeit, in the classical sense of repetition of the primordial drama, but rather represents the extension of that drama to encompass all time from the original rebellion of the divine beings to the eschaton. What it amounts to is nothing short of a radical mythologization of Israel's earlier perception of history. 4. Restoration of the Kingship of the Most High and of Cosmic Order (10:16-11:2). The final movement of the rebellion-in-heaven myth revolves not around destruction, but restoration. The Most High's victory over the rebels restores his kingship and the result is the renewal within the creation of order, harmony, and fruitfulness. This theme is introduced effectively under the banner of "the plant of righteousness and truth," a phrase tied up with the self-consciousness of sectarian apocalypticism of the third and second centuries B.C.E.15 The elaboration moves from the martial image of the escape of the righteous to the fertility imagery springing from near eastern cosmogonic myth: abundant birth, shalom, fruitfulness of the vine, the olive tree, and the wheat. All this is tied to a thorough purging of defilement, and ultimately is focused on the glorification of the victorious universal King: "And all nations shall offer adoration and shall praise Me, and all shall worship Me" (10:21). Two further elaborations reinforce the observations made above that the hermeneutic informing this expository narrative involves the extension of the scenario of the primordial drama to encompass the whole of time, from the original rebellion in heaven to the eschaton: First is the Most High's promise never again to send defilement, sin, punishment, and torment upon the earth. s1Compare with 1 Enoch 10:16: T. Judah 24:5, 1QS 8:5; 11:8; CD 1:7. 201</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE In effect, the period from the time of the deluge to the Noatic covenant which in Gen 9:8-17 involves the briefest possible interval is sprung open so as to encompass all of history from the diluvian age to the eschaton. All of history is, therefore, placed under the ominous chaos of the deluge, which in its first instance failed to achieve the intended effect of purgation. Against this background, the paradisiacal portrait of abundant offspring, shalom, and fruitfulness in field and vineyard found in 1 Enoch 10:17-19 becomes intelligible: the blessings of the Noatic covenant (Gen 8:17, 22; 9:1), deferred over the ages by reason of the works of the evil spirits which survived the first deluge, would at last come to fruition in the wake of the final battle of the Most High against his rebellious adversaries. There is a second manifestation of the mythic extension of the primordial drama to encompass all of history, inasmuch as 1 Enoch 11:1 refers to the blessings of the covenant in Deut 28:12 and announces that the very blessings which the building of the second temple under the high priest Joshua and the Davidic king Zerubbabel was unable to inaugurate (Hag 2:6-9) would be showered from heaven in the final chapter of the divine drama. We witness a harsh tearing of all earlier heilsgeschichtliche schemata in the service of a radical remythologization of Israel's perception of divine activity. Finally, it may be noted that this juxtaposition of the two aspects of the divine response to the rebellion-in-heaven forms the warp and woof of a pattern encountered throughout apocalyptic compositions, early and late, constituting the genre of salvation-judgement oracle.16 II. The Semihazah Narrative and the Myth of Rebellion-in-Heaven In the Semihazah account we find an expository narrative, many of whose features are drawn from the Genesis text. But the message developed in that exposition leads far beyond the biblical message, indeed, leads to teachings quite alien to any of the levels of pentateuchal traditions in Genesis. For in the etiological thrust of 1 Enoch 6-11, tracing the origin of all evil back to the primordial rebellion of divine beings against the Most High, we find a dualistic note struck which is discordant with the central message of Genesis, that Israel's God was sovereign over all things, and that evil stems from human rebellion against that sovereign God. Within the history of the Yahwist, Gen 6:1-4 serves to document yet another stage in the progressive degeneration of the human race. While an earlier mythopoeic thrust is visible in the descent of the sons of god and in the hint given by the etiology in v 3 that the heavenly realm is somehow threatened by the resulting procreation, that thrust fades before the new Yahwistic theologoumenon of the sole sovereignty of Yahweh. 1 Enoch 6-1 1, however, revives the ancient concern in mythopoeic thought of producing a cosmogonic explanation of the basic polarities discerned at the center of human existence. The ubiquitous theme found in many myths '60n the sixth-fifth century B.C.E. origin of this genre, and on its roots in earlier myth, see P. D. Hanson, The Dawn of Apocalyptic (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1975). 202</page><page sequence="9">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN throughout the Near East of the second millennium B.C.E. concerning the introduction of cosmic disharmony through the rebellion of certain members of the pantheon is revived in the story of Semihazah and his associates. Thus a familiar phenomenon is encountered anew: a mythic pattern of thought, absorbed into early Yahwism and modified almost beyond recognition in the service of a new theologoumenon, is retrieved by later apocalypticism and reinfused with some of its original meaning. The reason for this is in part accounted for by social and cultural influences: after the loss of nationhood, a sectarian group, living amidst the pressures and even oppression of foreign potentates and collaborating compatriots once again reaches back for archaic symbols which, in the earlier period of national pride and buoyant development of indigenous cultic forms in conscious opposition to neighboring mythopoeic systems, had lost their appeal. But social and cultural determinants do not supply the full explanation: firstly, because of the presence in this later literature of mythopoeic elements not present in biblical tradition and yet paralleled in ancient near eastern myth; secondly because of the vitality of the mythic themes in these compositions. Together, these two factors are best accounted for by postulating the presence of an unbroken stream of influence from mythic structures of thought which ultimately trace their parentage to the great near eastern religious systems of the second millennium.17 This postulate raises a further question: does the stream of influence which supplies fresh impetus to this late reapplication of mythopoeic thought flow in unbroken continuity through Jewish religious experience, or around it in foreign cults, only to reenter Jewish experience in the Persian and Hellenistic periods? Though there is mounting evidence for significant mythopoeic religiosity in Israel during virtually all periods, the question is not amenable to one universally applicable answer. We ask it, therefore, only in relation to our text in Enoch, and indeed at this point, with focus limited to the Semihazah stratum. Early in Yahwism, and then in prophetism, Yahweh was proclaimed sole sovereign over heaven and earth, thereby excluding other deities from a role in the creation and governance of the world order, an exclusion which extended even to the darker sides of that order: ultimately, all that existed was to be ascribed to the free acts of the one God of Israel. Thus, for example, it was Yahweh who hardened the heart of pharaoh, who sent an evil spirit upon Saul, and who commissioned the lying spirit to enter the mouths of the 400 prophets of Ahab. It is our task to identify the alternative view which maintained that disorder originated with rebellious divine beings in an event of primordial times, for the exposition of the Semihazah story transformed the message of the Genesis text from the theologoumenon of prophetic Yahwism into just this alternative mythopoeic view. 170ne need look only to Hosea, Jeremiah, and Isaiah 56-66 for evidence that a lively substratum within Israelite society kept alive the symbols and patterns of ancient myth, which elements were infused with added vitality by the syncretistic attitude of kings like Manasseh. 203</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Since this general view of the origin of disorder is ubiquitous in the ancient world, our investigation must be given focus by the specific structural pattern found in 1 Enoch 6-11. The essential dramatic pattern of the Semihazah narrative we summarize thus: Background note: Sons of Heaven and Daughters of Earth (6:1-2a). (1) Plot of rebellion by astral deities in heaven and their descent (6:2b-8). (2) Sexual commingling, birth of giants, devastation caused by the giants, earth's plea (7:1- 6 [minus 7:lde], 8:4). (3) Angelic intercession before the Most High, deliverance of Noah and punishment of the rebels and their offspring who are bound and cast to earth, ultimately punished in the fiery abyss (9:1-10:15 [minus 9:6, 8c, and 10:4-10]). (4) Restoration of the Kingship of the Most High and of Cosmic Order (10:16-11:2). In the effort to account for the origin of this mythic pattern, direct recourse to Hellenistic parallels has commonly led to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions concerning sources of influence. Mythic patterns such as this one normally issue from a long history of development, and particular versions of such mythic patterns are best understood against the background of the history of the myth in question. In the case of the Semihazah narrative, we are led back to several Hurrian myths (preserved in Hittite). Writers such as Hans Gtiterbock and Peter Walcot'8 have correctly recognized in these myths one of the near eastern sources behind material in Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days. Since Hesiod in turn is a source behind later Greek and Hellenistic myths about titanic rebels against the King of Heaven (including Prometheus), the possibility of a common near eastern origin of such myths and their counterparts in Jewish sectarian literature of the late second temple period deserves to be considered alongside hypotheses, like that of George Nickelsburg, which detect direct lines of influence connecting the Greek and Jewish materials. These Hurrian myths, therefore, provide the beginning point for our sketch of the mythic pattern behind 1 Enoch 6-11. First, in the Kumarbi myth, we find the following episode:19 (1) Kumarbi viciously attacks the King of Heaven, Anus. (2) He is impregnated in the course of castrating Anus, and gives birth to three dreadful deities (the storm god, the Tigris River, and the storm god's attendant, all agents of devastating force). (3) Anus punishes him upon the rocks of the mountains.20 (4) Anus is restored as King of Heaven, even as order is restored in the universe.21 '8H. G. Giiterbock, 'The Hittite Version of the Hurrian Kumarbi Myth: Oriental Forerunners of Hesiod," AJA 52 (1948) 123-34; Peter Walcot, Hesiod and the Near East (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1966). '9Translated in H. G. Gtiterbock, "The Hittite Version," 124-25 and A. Goetze, ANEI2 120- 21. 20The end of the text is damaged, but lines 34-6 indicated the nature of the punishment: "In the end thou shalt have to strike the rocks of the mountains with thy head" (H. G. Giiterbock, "The Hittite Version," 124). 2'Due to the fragmentary nature of the text, this point involves extrapolation, though of a most palpable nature. 204</page><page sequence="11">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN Whereas the Kumarbi myth gives an account of rebellion against the King of Heaven by a younger deity, the Ullikummi myth reports an instance of the same god rebelling against the younger deity, Tesub (the storm god):22 Background: Heaven and earth have been established as two separate realms as a result of the former gods who "came and severed the heavens from the earth with a cleaver .. ."23 Tesub reigns in heaven.

(2) Kumarbi impregnates an earthly female object,24 and a diorite giant (Ullikummi) is born of the union, who as a rebel ally of Kumarbi causes great devastation in heaven and on the earth.25 (3) Tesub takes to battle with his 70 divine allies and, after initial failure, is aided by Ea who severs Ullikummi from his position upon Ubelluris26 with the cleaver which originally severed the heaven from the earth; Tesub engages anew in battle, this time inflicting punishment upon Ullikummi. (4) Tesub, victorious in battle, is restored as King of Heaven.27 In addition to the usual four-fold pattern, the additional theme which receives emphasis in the myth concerns the relation between heaven and earth, once inseparably bound as one, but since severed and distinct. The diorite giant, Ullikummi, attempted to rejoin the two when, "like a tower he was lifted up, so that he reached up to the kuntarra house (the house of the gods),"28 but he is cut down with the same weapon which originally severed heaven from earth, a weapon safeguarded by the "olden gods" in "the ancient storehouses of the fathers and forefathers."29 We make reference to one more Hurrian myth, the Illuyanka myth (older version):30 (1) The dragon Illuyanka vanquished the storm god. (2) No direct reference is given to the birth of giants, but the offspring of Illuyanka take part in the action: "the Dragon Illuyankas came up with [his children] and they ate (and) drank . . ."31 (3) The storm god appeals to all the gods: "Come ye to my aid." Hupasiyas, a mortal ally of the storm god "trussed the Dragon with a rope. The Stormgod came and killed the dragon. . . 32 22Text and translation in H. G.

Since Hurrian elements were prominent in Late Bronze Age Ugarit, it is not surprising to find an allomorph of this mythic pattern within the cultic literature of this canaanite city-state. The myth has taken a subservient position within the larger Baal-Mot cycle, and as Richard Clifford has suggested, the original rebellious attack of "Ashtar the Rebel" has paled due to the new focus on the conflict between Baal and Mot.33 Ashtar the Rebel went up to the reaches of Zaphon He sits enthroned on the throne of Aliyan Baal. His feet did not reach the footstool. His head did not reach the top. And Ashtar the Rebel said, "I will not reign on the reaches of Zaphon." Ashtar the Rebel came down. He came down from the throne of Aliyan Baal. And he reigned over the whole of the vast earth.34 The pattern we have outlined in Hurrian mythology is partially visible here: (1) The astral deity, Ashtar (the Morningstar, Venus), rebels and attempts to take the throne of Baal. (2) The procreation motif is missing. (3) Punishment follows (here weakened to voluntary abdication in the form of descent to the earth (ba-arsi, i.e., either earth or underworld; in either event he is consigned to a lower realm). (4) Implicit in the failure of Ashtar (like ydc yllhn before him) to hold the throne is the restoration of Baal's kingship, which is deferred in the present text due to the insertion of this episode into the Mot cycle. It is important to note that this Ugaritic text assigns the role of rebel to an astral deity, since the rebels in 1 Enoch 6-11 are clearly astral deities as well.35 33Richard J.

To be compared in this connection is CTA 23 where sahru and salimu (Morning-star and Evening-star) apparently rebel against El (see Clifford, Cosmic Mountain, 165-68). Also of interest, because of the mode of the punishment described, is Anat's defeat of the rebellious dragon in PRU II.3.8-10: In the land of Mhnm he (the dragon) swished the sea, His double tongue licked the heavens, His twin tails churned up (?) the sea. She fixed the unmuzzled dragon. She bound (him) to the heights of Lebanon. Tr. R. Clifford, Cosmic Mountain 60; cf. S. Loewenstamm, "Anat's Victory over the Tannanu," JSS 20 (1975) 22-7; J. Barr, "Ugaritic and Hebrew 'SBM'?' JSS 18 (1973) 17-39. Loewenstamm makes a strong case for translating sbm in PRU2.3.7-10 and CTA 3.3.35-44 as "to bind, fetter." The motif of binding is thereby emphasized all the more. 35E.g., kokabTlel, rami el, barq-iyal, samsiape'l, Sariel (GSYn). 206</page><page sequence="13">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN We thus recognize the coexistence of two allomorphs of the rebellion-in- heaven myth, one describing astral rebels, the other zoomorphic or anthropomorphic rebels associated with the storm and sea. Shortly, we shall observe the continued coexistence of these two allomorphs in biblical lore. We may speculate on the roots of these alternate versions by suggesting that the former is the product of observation of the ascent of Venus in the subdued light of the morning, only to be blotted out by the more brilliant light of the rising sun; and by tracing the latter to the perennial struggle between sterility and fertility as symbolized by the earthshaking thunder and lightning storms racing over the sea in the direction of lands parched by the withering heat of summer.36 Within biblical writings, the mythic pattern which we are attempting to trace is applied to a theologoumenon which ascribes sole sovereignty to Yahweh. Therefore it cannot be transplanted replete with its original polytheistic setting and mythopoeic trappings. That it could be adopted at all is due to a new function: that mythic pattern (or in certain cases, vestiges of it) is used in taunts and oracles of judgment against earthly potentates who are likened to the old rebellious deities of old. Isa 14:5-21 is a taunt against the king of Babylon, who is likened to helel ben-sahar, that is, "the shining one, son of the dawn," i.e., Venus, the morningstar (LXX eusphoros). Here we meet the astral deity already encountered at Ugarit, Ashtar, who also appeared in the hypostasis of sahru. Helel ben-sahar has rebelled against the Most High, having declared, I will ascend to heaven: above the stars of God, I will set my throne on high I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High. 36In the Enuma elis the pattern of the rebellion-in-heaven myth is found, and while it too involves struggles between different generations of the gods, it does not draw the relation of the heavenly to the mundane realm into any more than the final phase of the drama. It is the second episode of rebellion which concerns us here, for in it the older gods seek to disrupt the order established by the younger executive deities after Apsu's fall, leading to the usual scenario: (1) Rebellion: Their heart(s) having plotted evil . . . , "they urge Tiamat, 'Do thou avenge them!"' (2) "Birth" and devastation: Tiamat responds, "Let us make monsters . . , [let us do] battle against the gods [ . . . ]!" (1. 125-7). Together the eleven monsters thus created form a fearsome lot, blood-thirsty, raging, with Kingu at their head. (3) Punishment of the rebels: Here a difference exists, in that a new leader rises up from the divine assembly after two of the older deities fail to meet the challenge: With a net Marduk enfolds Tiamat. Her associates fare equally poorly: "Thrown in a net, they found themselves ensnared; placed in cells, they were filled with wailing; Bearing his wrath, they were held imprisoned." (4. 112-14). As for the monsters, them "he cast into fetters, their hands [ ... ]" (3. 117). Finally Kingu "he bound and accounted him to the Uggai," that is, in the netherworld (4. 120). (4) Marduk's kingship is established by his victory, and this leads to the establishing of order, including the creation of the human race. Though definite connections exist between this and the other myths outlined above, the latter stand in a tighter line of development with the specific forms of the rebellion-in-heaven myth which leads to Gen 6:1-4 and I Enoch 6-11. 207</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE His rebelliousness has also brought desolation to the earth, having "made the world like a desert . .. destroyed your land . . . slain your people." As the theme-line of the taunt indicated, the Most High's punishment was harsh: "How you are fallen from heaven. ..." Like mortal and divine rebels before him, he is consigned to the nether region: But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit . . . clothed with the slain, those pierced with the sword, who go down to the stones of the Pit, like a dead body trodden underfoot. As in the case of Semihazah, his offspring are to be included in the punishment: Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of their fathers, lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities. The mythic pattern of the war in heaven, in its astral allomorph, is surprisingly complete here, with the rebellion, the reference to the devastation of the earth, and the punishment upon "the stones of the Pit." Absent is the theme of procreation of giants, though the offspring of the heavenly rebel are mentioned as recipients of the punishment (v 21). The final victory of the Most High and the restoration of order is announced already at the beginning of the poem: How the oppressor has ceased, the insolent fury ceased! The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers. ... The whole earth is at rest and quiet. ... The taunt furnishes valuable information about the Pit to which these rebels (both the divine rebels and their earthly successors) are consigned. In v 9 we read: Sheol beneath is stirred up to meet you when you come, it rouses the shades to greet you, all who were leaders of the earth; it raises from their thrones all who were kings of the nations. All of them will speak and say to you: "You have become as weak as we! You have become like us!" Sheol is the nether dwelling-place of former potentates, mighty ones of old whom we shall come to see were guilty of similar acts of rebellion. We are reminded of the "olden gods" associated with "the ancient storehouse of the fathers and forefathers" in the Ullikummi myth. That such a "Tartarus" concept existed in classical biblical times is abundantly illustrated by a series of prophetic texts which fall into the 208</page><page sequence="15">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN rebellion-in-heaven pattern, to which we now turn. In Ezek 28:1-10 the rebellion-in-heaven myth is applied to the prince of Tyre who, in the pride of his heart, asserted: "I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas." But Yahweh's agents of destruction will deal harshly with this insolence: They shall thrust you down into the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas. The several versions of the rebellion-in-heaven myth which we have been considering variously locate the place of punishment in the sea or in the desert for the same reason that the Ugaritic myths present two versions of the primordial foe, Yamm and Mot; the latter are the two masks worn by the dark force inimical to fertility and order, even as the former are the loci of these two personae. The sea variant in this judgement on Tyre suits well its island setting, and the juxtaposition of pit and sea in this poem would have disturbed the ancient reader no more than would have the parallelism in 1 Enoch 10 of watery deluge (10:2), the valleys of the earth (10:12) and abyss of fire (10:13) as places of punishment. The myth is applied yet again in Ezek 28:11-19 against the King of Tyre. Here the antebellum divine status of the rebel is delineated: one "full of wisdom," "perfect in beauty," "in Eden, the garden of God." The astral setting seems clear if the rather palpable connection is made in v 14 between "stones of fire" and the stars as the sons of God: "You were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire, you walked." Then came the rebellion: "In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned." Yahweh, in his punishment, utilizes a divine agent who adumbrates Michael (1 Enoch 10:11) in his assignment against Semihazah: So I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian cherub drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire [i.e., the astral deities] . . . I cast you to the ground ..., I brought forth fire from the midst of you; it consumed you and it turned you to ashes upon the earth. ... You have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever. Here we find punishment in the form of being cast down to the ground combined with consumption by fire, adumbrating Semihazah's double punishment in 1 Enoch 10. The allomorph of the rebellion-in-heaven myth portraying the rebel under the guise of a dragon found already in the Illuyanka myth and in PRU II. 3.8- 10, 37 is applied in Ezek 32:2-8 to the pharaoh of Egypt: "like a dragon in the seas, you burst forth in your rivers, trouble the waters with your feet, and foul 37See also Isa 27:1, 51:9, Ezek 29:3-4; Ps 74:13-4; Job 40:25-6; Rev 12:7-9. 209</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE their rivers." The punishment inflicted by Yahweh follows the pattern familiar in 1 Enoch of binding, casting to the ground, and covering with darkness: I will throw my net over you with a host of many peoples; and I will haul you up in my dragnet and I will cast you to the ground, on the open field I will fling you ... I will strew your flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with your carcass .... When I blot you out, I will cover the heavens and make the stars dark . . . and the bright light of heaven will I make dark over you and put darkness upon your land. ... Yahweh's victory over the dragon is followed by another motif in 1 Enoch 10, that of cleansing the creation defiled by the rebel: Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil ... The rest of chapter 32 of Ezekiel elaborates on two paraphrases of the preceding poem, "I will cast you on the ground" and "all its (i.e., Egypt's) multitude shall perish" by portraying Egypt and Israel's other traditional foes (Assyria, Elam, Edom, etc.) as a host of rebels who are sent in punishment to the "netherworld, to those who have gone down to the Pit." This punishment is related to their crime: they "spread terror in the land of the living." The ultimate mythic roots of this notion of the pit or netherworld to which the enemies of Yahweh must descend are made clear by the indication in Ezek 32:27 that the desolate realm is one already populated by "the fallen mighty heroes of antiquity (gibborim nopelim me'olam [with GLDA]), a phrase which directs one explicitly to the nopelim and the gibborim of the rebellion- in-heaven mythic fragment preserved in Gen 6:1-4, the text being interpreted by 1 Enoch 6-11.38 The inhabitants who are already dwelling in Sheol and who greet Egypt and its multitude as new arrivals (who will be consigned to a lower region of the netherworld than they) are the primeval heroes, the gibborim me'^olm of Gen 6:4 who, it will be recalled, were born of the congress between the sons of god and earthly women. This prophetic use of the motif of rebellion-in-heaven and punishment in the form of descent into the netherworld thus involves a distinct historicization through application to Israel's historical foes, but this adaptation does not obscure the palpable signs of the mythic substratum: the inhabitants greeting those historical foes are primeval heroes, dramatis personae of the ancient rebellion-in-heaven myth. In their destructive insolence and arrogance, they are designated as "men of (dis)repute," demigods bent on challenging the Most High, as had their divine progenitors before them. In keeping with the ancestral versions of the myth in Hurrian and Ugaritic, these rebels too will stumble upon their pride, and far 31S. E. Kraeling, 'The Significance and Origin of Gen 6:1-4," JNES 6 (1947) 193-208. 210</page><page sequence="17">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN from seeing their status elevated, they will have it reduced to regions below. Belonging to the same mythic complex is the substratum of Gen 11, whose ancients would "build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in heaven, and make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered upon the face of the whole earth," that is, who would emulate Ullikummi when "like a tower he was lifted up, so that he reached up to the kuntarra house." They too are punished by Yahweh who "scattered them abroad over the face of the earth." Thus the "fallen mighty heroes of antiquity," helel ben sahar, the prince of Tyre and the pharaoh of Egypt all are consigned to the pit associated ultimately with the rebellion-in-heaven myth. Finally, as is typical of apocalyptic eschatology, we find the development come almost full circle in third and second century visionary literature where the prophetic historicizing of the myth is abandoned, and we once again find astral deities as the ones rebelling and being consigned to the netherworld. We are obliged to include the qualifier "almost," however, for the salvation-judgment oracle which we find at the end of 1 Enoch 6-11 extends the punishment of the divine rebels to their earthly counterparts, though in a way less explicitly historical in emphasis than was the case in earlier prophetic eschatology. In Ezek 32, then, we find the rebellion-in-heaven myth applied extensively, with particularly full treatment given to the motif of the netherworld in the latter half of the chapter. We can appropriately conclude a discussion of this chapter by observing how the "shades of the mighty heroes" ('el gibbo6rim)39 "speak of them, with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol," for this, together with the description in v 27 of the mighty heroes of antiquity reposing with their weapons of war, gives a vivid picture of a scene tracing ultimately back to the myth of rebellion-in-heaven. We shall briefly examine one more instance where Ezekiel applies the motif of the netherworld, in chap. 26:19-21. Tyre is personified as an insolent rebel, "who imposed your terror on all the mainland." The occasion of the lament is "the day of your fall," and the agent of punishment is in the first instance the deluge: "When I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you." As in 1 Enoch 10, the deluge is followed by the wilderness pit, a nether region which, as in the above examples, is inhabited by "the people of antiquity" ('am '6lam): Then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the nether world, among primeval ruins, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or have a place in the land of the living. I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more; though you be sought for, you will never be found again, says the Lord God. The picture is again taken from the punishment in the netherworld of the rebellion-in-heaven myth. It is a realm which has had inhabitants whose history traces back to primeval times, indeed, the picture is one resembling what one could see on a moon-lit night on any near eastern tell, could one add 39Kraeling, 'The Significance," 196. 211</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE to the stubs of ancient walls and scattered debris the fleeting images of the shades of antiquity. The LXX renders the "primeval ruins" (hdrdbot me^olam) as a "primeval wilderness" (eremon aionion), which with its desolate pit looks very much like the eremon with its abyss in 1 Enoch 10. Moreover, the overall pattern in Ezek 26:17-21 of rebellious insolence and pride, leading to the perpetration of destruction and terror on earth, evoking divine punishment in the form of descent into the netherworld, followed by final destruction in "a dreadful end" matches the progression of events found in the Semihazah narrative of 1 Enoch 6-11. In Isaiah and Ezekiel we have observed how the rebellion-in-heaven myth was adapted to serve a new function by being applied, in taunt and judgement oracle, to the kings of Israel's historical foes. The relation between kings and their individual divine patrons within the divine council made this transition, to be sure, a very easy one. In 1 Enoch the historicization of the myth which occurred within Israelite prophecy weakens, and the myth tends to move back to its heavenly setting. This remythologization already began, however, within biblical writings of the post-exilic period, as indicated by a passage in the Isaiah apocalypse (Isa 24:21-3, late sixth or early fifth century): On that day the Lord will punish the host of heaven, in heaven, and the kings of the earth, on earth. They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit; They will be shut up in a prison, and after many days, they will be punished. Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed for the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his elders he will manifest his glory. The time framework is the same as that in 1 Enoch 6-11, since this passage is an early instance of apocalyptic eschatology: primordial conflict is extended to give a portrait of an end-time denouement. The rebellion in heaven here has its earthly counterpart, as delineated so effectively by the parallelism of v 21. The form of Yahweh's punishment is that standard to the rebellion-in-heaven myth: the rebels are imprisoned in the pit. As in 1 Enoch, imprisonment in the pit is but a penultimate form of punishment, to be followed by their final judgement: "and after many days they will be punished," which in 1 Enoch becomes "the great judgement" (10:6), and "the judgement that is forever" (10:12). Finally, in keeping with the mythic pattern, this passage also ends with the restoration of the reign of the King of Heaven (v 23). It is interesting to note also that the Apocalypse preserves a fragment of the dragon allomorph of the myth (27:1) which was also found in Hurrian and Ugaritic reflexes. The Isaiah Apocalypse, therefore, furnishes an important link between the historicized application of the rebellion-in-heaven mythic pattern in biblical prophecy, and its readaptation within a remythologized setting in 1 Enoch. The pattern of the rebellion-in-heaven myth which we have traced from Hurrian sources to a reflex in Ugaritic and finally on into biblical lore thus leaves traces of an unbroken continuum, and raises the distinct possibility that the expositor who wrote the Semihazah narrative drew upon this same 212</page><page sequence="19">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN traditional pattern. If this is the case, an alternative solution is offered to the various attempts to derive the main features of the story from Greek and Hellenistic sources. This is in no way to deny that parallels to various features in 1 Enoch 6-11 are found in Hesiod and later Greek writers. But, as observed earlier, it is important to remember that the roots of the Greek myths containing such parallels reach back to the same ancient near eastern sources which underlie the biblical and post-biblical reflexes of the rebellion-in- heaven myth. Ultimate derivation of 1 Enoch and the Greek myths in question from the same ancient near eastern sources thus may offer a more plausible explanation for these parallels than the argument for direct influence of, let us say, Hesiod or Aeschylus upon the author of the Semihazah narrative. Before ending this discussion of the background of the rebellion-in-heaven pattern, one major theme and several minor ones remain to be discussed. The major theme, which is developed in the second movement of the rebellion-in- heaven myth (the birth of gigantic offspring to the rebels), is the cohabitation of the rebels with the daughters of humanity. Since a significant degree of flexibility characterizes the versions of this myth in describing the method utilized by the rebels to propagate allies (e.g., single-handed generation, impregnation of an inanimate object, creation with the assistance of another god), the fact of procreation with human consorts offers no intrinsic difficulty. Yet an explanation on the level of comparative religion would be desirable. In seeking such explanation, Gen 6:1-4 offers the major clue. Underlying Gen 6:1-4 we find the theme of setting limits to the extension of the human race, in contemporary jargon, birth control.40 We are told in Gen 6:1 that humanity had multiplied on the face of the earth. This increase in population, moreover, enters a new phase when the rebelling deities add their sperm to the process. Moreover, their offspring offer unique problems, being demigods (nepli^m and gibborim) who would live inordinately long lives. Within the popular thought of antiquity, this was an explosive situation threatening the viability of the ordered life of the gods, inasmuch as the realm of the gods in the ancient Near East was inextricably bound to human society, being dependent upon it for sustenance, and vulnerable to agitation from its clamor and unrest. Therefore, whether the root dwn in v 3 is associated with the meaning "strive," or "abide," the lesson drawn is a common ancient near eastern theme: divine limits must be set on the creative process generating the human race. Why the Yahwist was able to utilize the mythic fragment in Gen 6:1-4 is apparent. Not only did it add an illustrative dimension to his theme of the degeneration of the human race, but it suited also two related themes in his 40After completion of this article, my attention was directed to the provocative article of Anne D. Kilmer, "The Mesopotamian Concept of Overpopulation and Its Solution as Reflected in the Mythology," Orientalia 41 (1972) 160-77 and to William L. Moran's review of W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atra-Fasls: the Babylonian Story of the Flood (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969) in Biblica 52 (1971) 51-61. Both draw conclusions closely related to points developed in the next several pages. 213</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE theology: the divinely ordained separation of heaven and earth as two distinct realms, and the enforcement of distinct limits upon the human race, points made in a chain of episodes: the rape of the tree-of-knowledge-of-good-and- evil, the expulsion from Eden through a passage guarded by cherubim and a flaming sword, the descent of the sons of God, the flood, and the tower of Babel. The last mentioned illustrates the divine concern vividly: "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they proposed to do will be impossible for them." In response to this threat, new measures are imposed to set limits on the encroachment of the growing human race. This theme of encroachment calls to mind a group of ancient mythic texts dealing with population control. Since the Atrajasis Epic moves from this concern to the episode of the flood, it offers a logical beginning point for comparison with the primeval history of Genesis. Heaven, Earth, and Apsu had been separated, with Anu, Enlil, and Enki presiding over them respectively. On his earthly estates, Enlil works the junior gods so hard that they rebel. The divine assembly is convened to deal with the crisis and hears Enlil's request that one of the rebels be killed as an example. But the rebels are not without advocates and a solution is found in the creation of the human race to relieve the gods of their manual labors. The description of the creation process (though suffering from a damaged text) is intriguing in its detail, involving the coordinated efforts of Mami and Enki, assisted by the fourteen birth goddesses. The point is that creation of mundane creatures is a serious business not to be engaged in lightly, but only at the consent of the convened assembly of the gods and in a way ordained by that body. Just how serious a business human creation is emerges in what follows: f"... the peoples multiplied, the [land] was billowing [like a bull]. The god got disturbed with [their uproar]."41 Enlil responds: "The noise of mankind [has become too intense for me], [with their uproar] I am deprived of sleep" (1.358-9). Measures are thereby instituted to reduce population: First, the plague is sent. King Atrahasis intercedes for his people (cf. the intercessory role of the angels in 1 Enoch 9); Enki advises them to sacrifice to the god of the plague, and the plague ends. Again the people multiply. Enlil next sends drought. The same sequence of acts leads to its abatement. Though the text is very broken at this point, there was apparently a resumption of the drought, with Enki again assisting tamanity. The climax comes as Enlil assembles a council of war, and institutes the most devastating measure of all, the flood. Though Enki was bound by oath to cooperate, he found an indirect means of aiding Atrahasls, who, with his family, escapes the fate of the rest of humanity. After the flood, the thrice-tricked Enlil consents to the continuation of the human race, but with instructions to Enki and the mother goddess to set up more adequate means of population control, including the category of barren 4'1.353-5.

Millard, Atra-Ilasls). 214</page><page sequence="21">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN women, a pdsittu-demon causing infant mortality, and several orders of celibate priestesses.42 The Atrahasis Epic fills in the background against which the significance of divine beings descending to propagate offspring with the daughters of humanity can be addressed. The birth process is a very problematic matter, even when carried on through the legitimate channels (that is, with the consent of the duly convened assembly of gods). How much more problematic when procreation occurs illicitly! Even proper creation necessitated the harsh measures of plague, drought, and flood, and no small measure of strain and stress among members of the divine assembly (compare in Gen 3 the enmity, birth pains, and curse of unfertile ground).43 It is then dramatically clear that illicit procreation would amount to rebellion, to defiance of the order of the assembly of the gods. Moreover, such unsanctioned creative acts were bound to have disastrous results, namely, grotesque, unnatural, fearsome, destructive offspring, the likes of monsters, demons, evil spirits, chaotic beasts of all sorts. Another example of illicit creation within the mundane realm is found in the myth of Enki and Ninmah,44 where these two gods, in a state of drunken frivolity, out-do each other in the creation of freak human beings; once again, the creative process removed from the sanctioned actions of the assembly, and gone awry. From all this it can be concluded that in ancient thought, the propagation of earthly beings was not a trifling activity to be entered into lightly. The relations between heaven and earth, as two realms separated since an age preceding the human race, were regulated by severe controls, and especially population growth was a complex phenomenon requiring control mechanisms such as barren women, eunuchs, virgin priestesses, pestilence and drought. Gods (or humans) who violated those sanctions were vulnerable to severe punishment. A relatively late example of this is the Prometheus legend: not only was the god who tried to narrow the gap between those two realms punished, but in addition, humans, having benefited from the added advantage of the purloined fire, were forced to accept added control devices to offset their newly strengthened position, devices which were released from the first birth control box, borne by Pandora. From this information supplied by the myths concerning the ancient attitude toward the problematics of human creation, there arises the hitherto unexplained connection between the rebellion-in-heaven myth and the descent for the purpose of propagation of gigantic heroes in Gen 6:1-4. Any unauthorized procreative activity was an unmistakable, blatant act of rebellion against the assembly of the gods. This theme melded very easily with the rebellion-in-heaven myth, especially since the creatures thereby arising 42III.vii. 1-11 (p. 103 in Lambert and Millard, Atra-ljasis). 43See also the Gilgamesh Epic, XI. 183-86. 44The myth is described by T. Jacobson in Before Philosophy, H. and H. A. Frankfort, et al. (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1949) 175-79. 215</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE could be fit conveniently into the fighting ranks of the rebel gods. Myths like that of Enki and Ninmah also explain why the offspring of the rebels against heaven are monsters, giants, freaks, chaotic beings of grotesque shape and bellicose disposition, and totally inimical to life: Being the products of illicit activity, they do not conform to the divinely established sanctions of order and structure which regulate proper creative processes. This is the underlying common element which wrap such strange bedfellows under one blanket: Kumarbi's gigantic rock monster Ullikummi, whose stature reached up to the heavens, Tiamat's Mad-Dog, Scorpion-Man, and Dragon-Fly, the bene ha'elohim, the nepim, the gibborim, the 'anse hassem, and finally Semihazah and company's giants of three thousand ells. Late grandchildren of this motley crew are Obriareus, Cottus, Gyes, and the various other titanic monsters and giants of Hesiod and later Greek authors. This explanation of the provenance of the birth of the giants of the daughters of humanity leaves the pathway unobstructed from the versions of the rebellion-in-heaven myth which we have discussed to the Semihazah narrative, for the other unique features, in part already found in Gen 6:1-4, are the natural results of the new setting within Yahwism and then postexilic Judaism, e.g., the erosion in status of the other divine beings in relation to the Most High, the banishment of female deities from the plot, the resulting multiple roles of the Most High who, for example, assumes both Enlil's role of sending the flood, and Enki's role of delivering the diluvian patriarch. Within the new setting of Judaism, moreover, it is hardly possible for the illicit offspring of the rebels to attack heaven; hence, in 1 Enoch their destructive acts focus on the earth. Similarly, the King of Heaven's counterattack so elaborately and dramatically portrayed in the early rebellion-in-heaven myths, is transformed into a stately forensic process in the Semihazah story. This development is adumbrated by Ps 82 (vv 1-2, 5-7): God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgement; How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? ... They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. I say, "you are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like any prince." Here the bene cely6n are the same heavenly beings found in Gen 6 and 1 Enoch 6-11, and once again their rebellious, destructive activities are described (v 5). and here too their fall is awaited, and in the form which we find in I Enoch, that of the stately forensic decree of the God whose position as head of the divine council is restored against any encroachment of disobedient deities: "Arise, oh God, judge the earth; for to thee belong all the nations!" (v 8). 216</page><page sequence="23">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN When this new setting within the bible and later Judaism is taken into consideration and when the length of time separating the Hurrian, Hittite, Babylonian, and Ugaritic materials from the story about Semihazah is remembered, the consistency with which the four parts of the mythic pattern are applied along this entire millennium-long continuum is quite remarkable. Obviously, the struggle dramatized by this pattern was one which accounted for polarities which were central to the experience of the several cultures represented. Let us now return to the Semihazah narrative and review the elements of the rebellion-in-heaven pattern as they were handed down by antecedent tradition. In several Hurrian myths we find accounts of a rebellion in heaven where the rebel god (and his allies) attacks the reigning deity. An aspect of the rebellion is the creation of (an) agent(s) of devastation, which rebellious act threatens the order of the universe. The King of Heaven counterattacks, inflicts punishment upon the rebel(s), and as a result of his victory is restored to kingship, with the attendant result that order is restored in the universe. Motifs within the pattern which are echoed in 1 Enoch are the place of punishment "upon the rocks of the mountains," the divinely ordained separation of heaven from earth, and the nether-dwelling place of fallen deities of antiquity. One difference to be noted is this: in Enoch it is not a rival chief god who rebels, but a group of lesser divine beings; this difference is the natural result of the monotheistic tendencies within the new setting. But the importance of this difference should not be exaggerated, since one rebel is singled out as the instigator, namely Semihazah. In the Azazel elaboration, this point applies even more clearly. The Ugaritic parallel which we cited [alongside which should be mentioned a late astral version of the Enuma elisl45 is important in reflecting the astral adaptation of the myth, for it is the form which recurs in 1 Enoch. In the biblical prophetic books of Isaiah and Ezekiel, several versions of the rebellion-in-heaven myth are found, representing both the astral and the zoomorphic/anthropomorphic allomorphs. In these versions, the myth has been applied to a new genre with a function distinct from the ritual function of the earlier versions: taunts and judgement oracles against foreign potentates. This does not obscure the four movements of the basic pattern, however. Moreover, specific elaborations on the four movements point in the direction of 1 Enoch: (1) the fuller description of the place of punishment as a pit, a 45In L. W. King, The Seven Tablets of Creation (London: Luzac, 1902) 210-2. The fragments are late (ca. 2nd century B.C.E.) and reflect the astrological interests of the time which are so vividly manifested in the astronomical sections of I Enoch. Though the equations of Marduk with Jupiter, Tiamat with a constellation, and Tiamat's monsters with signs of the zodiac are products of this late speculation, the astral aspects of the rebellion-in-heaven myth are visible already in the older versions of the Entma elis (e.g., Tablet 5); moreover, 6.13-16, when seen in relation to 4.1 11- 20, suggests intriguing connections with the astral speculations found in 1 Enoch 6-11 and elsewhere in the Enochian corpus. These connections, as well as the speculation contained in the later fragments mentioned above, invite further investigation, which, however, cannot be undertaken here. 217</page><page sequence="24">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE desolate nether region populated with the fallen gods of antiquity, noted for its rocks as well as its fire; (2) the presence of an agent of the King of Heaven who inflicts punishment upon the rebellious one (see especially Ezek 28:16, though even this agent is already adumbrated in Ea's role in the Ullikummi myth). Finally, Gen 6:1-4 gives the specific form of procreation by the rebels which we find in 1 Enoch, namely through consorting with the daughters of humanity. In connection with that biblical passage, we found traces of a specific motif associated with rebellion-in-heaven in the ancient Near East, the illicit creation of human beings, as illustrated especially by the Atrahasis Epic: for deities to engage in the act of creation without the express consent of the divine council is an act of rebellion against the King of Heaven and his assembly. The appropriateness of this motif within the rebellion-in-heaven mythic pattern is thus obvious. This review suggests an answer to our earlier question: Is the line of influence of the ancient mythic pattern of rebellion-in-heaven to be traced from the ancient sources to the non-Semitic (and especially Greek) myths, from which myths it re-enters Jewish religious consciousness only in the late postexilic period? Or is the line an unbroken one from the ancient near eastern sources, through preexilic and postexilic biblical writings all the way down to the Semihazah narrative in the third century B.C.E.? We consider the latter alternative to be strongly corroborated by the evidence presented in this section. III. The Perspective, Setting, and Function of the Semihazah Narrative The basic core of 1 Enoch 6-11 recounts the myth of angelic rebellion led by Semihazah in which heavenly beings cohabited with the daughters of humankind, who bore giants which in turn devastated the earth. In response to the cry of the human victims, archangels intercede and are moved to action by the Most High. The ensuing judgement, deliverance, and healing of the earth breaks out of the primordial time-frame, and transforms the narrative into a drama reaching from the Urzeit to the Endzeit, in which the events of the former blend into eschatalogical events. Repeated anchoring of the narrative in the text of Gen 6-11 indicates that we are dealing with some sort of exposition of the Torah. But in its daring reformulation of the text, and in the transformation of a link in an historical biblical narrative into a myth of end- time recapitulation of primordial realities, it goes far beyond the normal scope of either targum or haggadic midrash. It is instead a narrative exposition written from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology which utilizes the biblical text in elaborating on a sectarian view of reality. Addressing the problem of defilement in a fallen order, it first offers an etiology of evil in the world: all of the evil in the world stems from a heavenly event, the rebellion of certain divine beings, and more immediately, from the resulting generation of their pernicious offspring in the world. Related then to the transmundane explanation of the source of defilement is the development towards a 218</page><page sequence="25">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN denouement: extirpation of evil would not occur from within the world order, but through cataclysmic extension of primeval events, culminating in a purging of the evil angels and spirits and the restoration of a perfect order. Thus far it is clear that the perspective of the Semihazah narrative is that of apocalyptic eschatology. But has this perspective, which is widespread in the intertestamental period (being found in the literature of various sects as well as in the writings of mainstream Judaism), here been elevated to the status of a sectarian ideology, i.e., has it become the theologoumenon of an apocalyptic movement? While this inquiry into the setting and function of the Semihazah narrative does not yield easy answers, hints are found in the angelic prayer of intercession (9:4-5, 7-8ab, 9-11) and in the salvation-judgement oracle with which the unit ends (10:11-22; 11:1-2). The angelic prayer is an impassioned prayer which can best be understood as arising from a setting in which the members of the protagonist group are suffering oppression. Similarly, in the concluding salvation-judgement oracle, the condemnation of the evil angels and their offspring "to the end of all generations," juxtaposed with the deliverance and glorious salvation promised to the righteous, describes a polarized community setting analogous to that underlying Isa 56-66, Dan 7-12, and the sectarian writings of Qumran. Though the concern with theodicy, wedded to a pessimistic view regarding the possibilities inherent within historical processes, has moved the problem of alienation to the lofty plane of cosmic events, traces of the concrete social matrix have not been completely obliterated. Under circumstances within which the victims of oppression find themselves powerless to eradicate the evil they see engulfing them, they give expression both to their bitter frustrations and their fervent hopes by creating a new myth. Though new in particular details, however, it reuses an age-old mythic pattern, which is given the aura of biblical authority by the imitation of several expositional techniques common to the time. The entire literary creation is permeated by the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology, which, by giving identity to its protagonists, has been elevated to the status of a sectarian ideology. From this perspective they are able to use the ancient themes of the myth to explain their inability to overcome the powers of evil by exposing the primordial roots of those inimical powers in the fall of heavenly beings whose malevolent offspring still populate the world. And within the same mythic complex, interpreted in the light of their biblical exposition, they are able to discover grounds for renewed hope in the Most High's intervention to accomplish that which was beyond human power, the eradication of evil and the recreation of a perfect order for the faithful. The Semihazah narrative thus reflects a view of reality which has broken almost completely with the integration of divine acts into historical events which characterized prophetic eschatology. From the new perspective of apocalyptic eschatology, historical agents have lost their significance within the scenario of the drama of judgement and salvation. While a clear delineation of the community setting and the composition's function within that setting elude us, the above-mentioned characteristics plausibly suggest 219</page><page sequence="26">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE that we are dealing with the speculation of a sectarian apocalyptic movement of the third century B.C.E., which movement it would seem remained active on into the second century as well. For affinities with the perspective of the early hdsidin and the Essenes are suggested not only by larger theological characteristics (e.g., the shared perspective of apocalyptic eschatology, deepening dualism, and speculation on the relation of earthly events to heavenly realities), but also by specific features (e.g., exegetical techniques, and favored appellatives, like "the plant of righteousness and truth"). More evidence is needed before further suggestions can be made about the identity of the group within which this remarkable story arose, evidence which, however, may come to light through further study of the Pseudo-Jonathan Targum, through thorough investigations of the calendar common to Qumran, the Book of Jubilees and the early strata of 1 Enoch, and through much more detailed investigation of other third and second century sectarian writings. IV. The Punishment of Azazel: The Semihazah Narrative Elaborated through Application of Leviticus 16 There is widespread agreement in the scholarly literature that the Semihazah narrative originally did not include the Azazel episode in 10:4-8.46 A convincing explanation for its introduction has not been given, however, and in the judgement of the present writer, the usual hypothesis that two independent traditions were brought together by an editor is not as satisfactory as the suggestion to be developed here that the Azazel section is an interpretive elaboration growing organically out of the Semihazah narrative. We begin with a comparison: the episode of the punishment of Azazel in 10:4-8 incorporates a structure which is parallel to the account of Semihazah's punishment: Semihazah Azazel (1) Messenger formula and the Lord said to Michael and the Lord said to Raphael (2) Command: bind Semihazah bind Azazel (3) Accusation:* . . defiled ... etc. ... corrupted ... etc. (4) Penultimate punishment:** [in] an opening in the desert in the valleys of the earth (5) Final judgement: the day of the judgement the day of the great that is forever judgement (6) Fire: led off to the abyss of fire cast into the fire 46That the Azazel sections must be accounted for separately from the Semihazah material has been noted by many scholars and their arguments (especially the contradiction between Semihazah as leader of the rebellious host in chap. 6 [cf. 69:2] and Azazel as leader in 8:1-2 [cf. chaps. 12-6 and 54-55]) need not be discussed here. The most recent thorough study of this question is the dissertation (unpublished) by Devorah Dimant, 'The Fallen Angels' in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Books Related to Them, (Heb.) Hebrew University, 1974. 220</page><page sequence="27">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN (7) Restoration of earth: and cleanse the earth and heal the earth *The accusation comes in the expected position in Semihazah, whereas it is mentioned just after the punishment and final judgement in Azazel and is applied (oddly) in the first instance to "The Watchers." V 7 therefore appears to be secondary. **The specific form of the description of the binding of Azazel will require explanation below. The Azazel episode gives the appearance of a terse recasting of the Semihazah episode, with only two elements departing from the model and requiring explanation: (1) The accusation section in the Azazel episode, focusing on the Watchers and coming in an unnatural position, looks spurious. This is explained by the fact that the biblical source of the Azazel material supplies no accusation against the hapless scapegoat. Rather, he is to atone for the sins of others. Thus the episode would have concluded with a simple order: "to him ascribe all sin" (10:8b). The accusation against the "secret things that the Watchers have disclosed," which is a theme belonging to an elaboration added to the Semihazah narrative (see below, section V) was introduced into the Azazel material so as to establish the culpability of this creature. (2) The second element which is not explained solely against the model of the Semihazah punishment is the distinctive description of the penultimate punishment, the binding, casting into the desert, etc. To this we turn, since it contains the clue to the provenance of the Azazel elaboration. We earlier observed a delight in paronomasia in the handling of the roots yrd, hrm, and sm. A later exposition carried this tendency further, possibly by way of a marginal gloss which elicited fuller development at a later stage of transmission. Here the catalyst was the name of one of the chiefs of ten listed among Semihazah's subordinates in stratum I, Asael, which name invited comparison with the scapegoat in the textus classicus of yom kippur in Leviticus 16 with the like-sounding name of Azazel.47 Since the main theme of the Semihazah story was the origin of evil and its eradication from the earth, the appropriateness must have seemed compelling for creating an expository connection with the community's primary rite dealing with purgation, the purpose of which is stated in succinct terms, thusly: "For on this day shall 47The Ethiopic text, since it preserves the greater distinction ('Asa'el/'azaz'el) seems to be more original than the Greek (Aseal/Azael), where the lesser distinction seems explainable only by the process of assimilation (*Azazel&gt;Azael under the influence of Aseal of 6:7, i.e., with retention of the first zeta and all the vowels of the original reading in 10:4 [as attested by the Ethiopic], with only the second zeta being lost by assimilation to Aseal). This view receives corroboration from the intimate relation between 1 Enoch 10:4-5 and Psuedo-Jonathan Targum Leviticus 16, since it gives independent evidence of a relation between the expostiory tradition preserved in 1 Enoch and the Azazel account in Leviticus 16; that is to say, the argument from inner-Ethiopic corruption is weakened (contra J. Grintz, "Do Not Eat on the Blood," Annual of the Swedish Theological Institute in Jerusalem 8 [1972] 102). If, though, this seems less likely, the Azael of the Greek is original here, then the paronomasia was left on the implicit level, which would have still made the intended connection in the reader's mind with Lev 16, since the further paronomasia, "rough and rocky," would have called to mind the name Azazel (not to mention the other allusions to Lev 16 to be noted shortly). 221</page><page sequence="28">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be made clean before the Lord" (Lev 16:30). Add to this shared theme the possibility offered by 1 Enoch 6:7 of associating Azazel with one of the rebels of primordial times, and one can sense the very attractive possibility for elaboration of the Semihazah narrative. The relation between Lev 16 and 1 Enoch 10:4-8 resembles that between Gen 6:1-4 and the Semihazah narrative, inasmuch as both of the Enoch stories retrieve some of the mythic ingredients which largely had been obscured by historicizing tendencies. Comparative data would suggest that Azazel was originally more than a desert location to which a scapegoat was sent, but was instead a god (or demon) perhaps consigned to the netherworld and appearing in desert places, to whom sacrifices had to be made to placate a malevolent disposition and satisfy a voracious appetite.48 Affinities with the destructive offspring of Semihazah and his ilk are patent. This is the sort of mythology with which the Azazel tradition of Lev 16 was reinfused once it was drawn into the Semihazah narrative. We are arguing, therefore, that the specific formulation of the terms of punishment of Azazel arose at the point of contact between Lev 16 and the Semihazah narrative. Since Lev 16 focused on the sacrifice of a goat for the cleansing of the land from sin, the logical place for its interpolation into the Semihazah narrative was in the third and fourth movements of the rebellion- in-heaven pattern, the punishment of the rebels and the restoration of kingship and order. In the versions of that myth considered in section II, the following motifs were found associated with the third movement: the binding of the rebel, throwing him down to earth, covering him with darkness, consigning him to the netherworld (the Pit, Sheol, etc.), and finally destroying him in the abyss of fire. These motifs were followed by the fourth movement, describing the restoration of world order. The description of Azazel's punishment draws freely upon these several motifs, a common feature of a late reflex of a mythic pattern. Four specific details, however, like the name Azazel itself, are best accounted for on the basis of expository connections with Lev 16. (1) The first detail is the unusual formulation: "make an opening in the desert" (10:4b). The desert location is a common enough feature in myths of this pattern (eremon as in LXX of Ezek 26:20), but the expression "make an opening" is without parallel. If the notion of casting into a pit is intended, one 48Within the Babylonian akitu festival, a goat was substituted for a human sacrifice to Ereshkigal, goddess of the abyss. Here we see another instance of the rocky pit, though in a different mythic setting. Even more notable in this connection is an Akkadian magical text, which prescribes that a goat be tied to the bed of an afflicted individual, whose sickness would be transmitted to the goat which in turn would be driven to a desolate place, where it would be decapitated, and cast into a pit. (Cf. Schmuel Ahituv, "Azazel," EncJud 3. 1001.) A close parallel is also found in a Hittite ritual, according to which a ram is to be driven from the land smitten with a plague in order to transport the plague away from the homeland to the land of the enemy (A. Goetze, "Ritual Against Pestilence," ANET2 347; cf. J. G. Frazer, The Scapegoat, vol. 9 of The Golden Bough [London: Macmillan, 1914]). 222</page><page sequence="29">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN would not expect a verb like anoixon ("open the desert"!), but a verb expressing "cast" or "hurl," followed by the prepositional phrase "into the pit." The expression "open the desert" stems from a far stranger phenomenon, again involving paronomasia. In relation to the Lev 16 passage, we are here at the point where the text stipulates: wslh 't hs'yr bmdbr, "he shall send the goat into the wilderness" (v 22b). Among the targumim, Onkelos and Neophyti retain the root slh, whereas Pseudo-Jonathan stands alone in converting to the root ptr, which is of course a perfectly natural translation.49 It is important to remember that Pseudo-Jonathan is a targum which bears close affinities with 1 Enoch.50 The question now is this: how can one explain the move from the Masoretic reading to this unusual formulation in the Greek: kai anoixon ten eremon ten ousan en tq Doudael51 kakei bale auton. Or in simple English, how does the sending of a goat designed for Azazel into the wilderness become transformed into opening the wilderness and casting Azazel therein? Pseudo- Jonathan, with its rendering of MT slh withptr offers the answer (wyptr.. yt spyr' Imdbr&gt;). Our interpreter, whom we know on other grounds to have had connections with the expository tradition preserved in Pseudo-Jonathan, recognizes in ptr yet another opportunity to tie the Lev 16 material to the theme of punishment of the heavenly rebels, and hence he plays the usual Aramaic meaning of ptr ("to send") over against its basic Semitic meaning of "to break open." That is to say, like Pseudo-Jonathan he renders slh of MT withptr, and draws upon the archaic meaning "to break open" in order to give the Lev 16 passage a new twist which adapts it to its new setting.52 Instead of the goat being sent to the wilderness for Azazel, an abyss is now opened in the wilderness to receive Azazel. This paranomasia onptr is subtle, but the syntax of the Aramaic would have safeguarded the intended meaning.53 In keeping with his identification of Azazel with the heavenly rebel Asael, this interpreter thus heightened the mythological dimensions of the yom kippur theme, thereby fitting it rather smoothly into the scenario of the Semihazah narrative. (2) The second detail which is not derived from the rebellion-in-heaven myth, but rather stems from exegesis of Lev 16, is the localization of the desert in Doudael. Involved is a location outside of Jerusalem which was the end- 49Whereas 1 Enoch 10:4-8 expands the biblical text in a manner resembling the expansions in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan of Lev 16 and Gen 6, Onkelos and Neofiti follow the MT literally in these chapters. It should be recalled in this context that this pattern of affinities between 1 Enoch and Pseudo-Jonathan has been observed elsewhere as well. 50Cf. Targ. Pseudo-Jonathan in Gen 6:4 where the nepilim are etymologized thus: smhz&gt;y w'wzy'l hnwn npylyn mn smy'. 5'We favor this form of the place name because of the combined support of Eth. (duda'el) and GSyn (Doudael). GGizeh has Dadouel. 52The Aramaic fragments from Qumran do not cover this verse, which means that possible confirmation of our conjecture that the original Aramaic text of Enoch would have had ptr (like Pseudo-Jonathan) must await future finds. 53An alternative interpretation of the evidence is this: the change from "send" to "make an opening" was introduced by the Greek translator as the result of his confusing ptr I withptr II. This I regard as less likely, since the theory developed above is supported by the other ways in which the author adapted the Lev 16 text to the punishment theme. 223</page><page sequence="30">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE point of the ritual behind Lev 16, supplied also in Pseudo-Jonathan in the form byt hdwry and in Yoma 6:8 as byt hdwdw. (3) The "rough andjagged rocks" again involve playful etymologizing, and once again Pseudo-Jonathan offers a close parallel. In that targum cz'zl is translated as "rugged and severe," and wilderness is modified with rocky (dswg), indicating the type of etymologizing exegesis which produced the expression "rough and jagged rocks" in 1 Enoch 10:5. (4) Finally, the expression which concludes the Azazel episode, "to him ascribe all sin" (which as noted earlier is not the product of the tertiary hand which supplied reference to the Watchers' secrets) stems from exegesis of Lev 16:21; it also is related to the expository tradition of which Pseudo-Jonathan is a representative, since the latter also has the phrase in direct discourse: "Place all their sins upon the head of the goat." These details lead us to conclude that the Azazel episode arose as an expository elaboration which sought to deepen the meaning of the Semihazah story by relating it to the yom kippur text in Lev 16. The basic structure of the episode was supplied by the mythic pattern of the Semihazah story, for the exposition modeled the elaboration on the account of the punishment of Semihazah. But the details unique to the Azazel episode can be recognized as stemming from the expository techniques of interpreters writing from the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology as they now relate their narrative to yet another biblical text, Lev 16. This symbiosis once again echoes motifs of great antiquity which derive from the rebellion-in-heaven pattern. Let us document but one example as a warning against overly hasty recourse to parallels in Greek literature, namely, the motif of binding Azazel. In the Ugaritic corpus one of the ancient rebels against heaven is tnn, the dragon, and in the description of Anat's victory over Sea and his army of monsters, we read l'istbm tnn, which Loewenstamm's translation "bind, fetter" now seems preferable to "muzzle."54 A close parallel is found in P. D. Miller's reconstruction of Ps 68:23: 'sbm bsn/'sbm mslwt ym,55 which should now be translated, "I fettered the Serpent, I fettered the abysses of Sea." In PR UII 3 it is now clear that another version of Anat's victory over Sea and his army of monsters is found. In that text the same root is used to portray the fettering or binding of tnn. In the Illuyanka myth, Tesub "trussed the Dragon with a rope."56 In the Enima elis Marduk enfolds Tiamat in a net (4. 95), fetters her monsters (4. 116-17), binds Kingu the rebel leader and consigns him to the netherworld (4. 119-20), and finally binds Tiamat to the great band (5. 59, where ut-rak-ki-is-ma corresponds to the root rks in PRU 2. 10, which in turn parallels sbm in that Ugaritic text). This motif of binding was adopted in prophetic texts to portray the capture of the rebel (e.g., Ezek 32:2-3; 38:4). Indeed Ezek 32, by combining the motifs of binding, casting into the pit, 54S. E. Loewenstamm, "Anat's Victory over the Tannanu," JSS 20 (1975) 25-7. 55P. D. Miller, Jr., 'Two Critical Notes on Psalm 68 and Deuteronomy 33," HTR 57 (1964) 240. 56A. Goetze, ANET2, 126. 224</page><page sequence="31">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN blotting out light, covering with darkness, and final healing of the earth, illustrates the important position assumed by late prophecy in mediating these archaic motifs from the ancient myths of rebellion in heaven to the writers of the Semihazah story and the Azazel elaboration.57 We are thus able to argue that motifs which were transmitted from ancient near eastern sources to the Greek world and which surfaced in legends like that of Prometheus followed a parallel line of development in their native near eastern soil, appearing in canonical writings and later in intertestamental works.58 V. The Perspective, Setting, and Function of the Azazel Elaboration The Azazel episode involves an elaboration of the themes of punishment and restoration in the Semihazah narrative through the application of motifs taken from the yom kippur ritual, especially as that ritual was interpreted in a tradition represented by the Pseudo-Jonathan Targum. As a result of various influences, primarily inner-Jewish in provenance, the simple ritual sending a scapegoat to the rugged, rocky hill of Azazel has become a description of the punishment of another divine figure. Thus Azazel begins to vie with Semihazah for visibility in this expanding expository narrative. It should be noted that the motif of divine beings teaching humans heavenly secrets was 57It might be noted that the motif of heaping stones upon the rebel-against-heaven is equally archaic. For example, in the Sumerian myth of the battle of Ninurta against the monster Kur, Ninurta heaps stones upon Kur (the myth is recounted in S. N. Kramer, Sumerian Mythology [Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1944] 80-2). 58Two intriguing questions arise in this connection which here cannot be developed, but merely mentioned: (1) What is the nature of the relationship between Pseudo-Jonathan and 1 Enoch which is evidenced by so many common elements? It must first be established that the relation is not one of slavish dependence in either direction. For example, though both Pseudo- Jonathan Lev 16 and 1 Enoch 10:4-8 go beyond MT Lev 16 in describing the destruction of the victim, the former reads, "a tempestuous wind from the presence of the Lord will carry him away, and he will die," while the latter explains, "he will be cast into the fire." This question deserves a fresh investigation, one which would likely find many hints like the following: Pseudo-Jonathan, in reading smhz'y and 'wzy'l together in Gen 6:4 seems to reflect a stage of transmission where the two figures were already identified within the same mythic context. Since we are suggesting that Azazel was introduced into the Semihazah myth by the interpolator of 1 Enoch 10:4-8, we would have to conclude that Pseudo-Jonathan does not antedate that interpolation. The possibility of a close connection between the circles producing, amplifying and transmitting our 1 Enoch material and that producing the Pseudo-Jonathan Targum thus suggests itself, but a closer description of that connection would be dependent on much additional evidence. (2) The second question is the much-discussed possibility of a relationship between the Promethean myth and 1 Enoch 10:4-8. Since George Nickelsburg (see n. 77 below) draws attention to the old studies arguing for this connection, and himself martials all pertinent evidence for this case, it can suffice here to say that the present author finds it possible to derive all aspects of the Azazel episode from Semitic sources, without recourse to Greek or Hellenistic materials. Since the Promethean legend traces back, through Hesiod, to many of the same near eastern sources which we discussed, it is not surprising to find parallel themes and motifs. Caution must always be exercised, however, in studying parallel themes and motifs within the larger mythic patterns of which they are a part. Since themes (like the deception of Zeus) and motifs (like the ravenous eagle) which are central to Prometheus play no part in Enoch, the common features are perhaps better accounted for by the common source theory rather than by theories of direct influence. 225</page><page sequence="32">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE not yet a part of the story. Entering later as the dominant feature of a second interpretive elaboration, it permeated both the Semihazah and the Azazel material. Since the Azazel elaboration does not constitute an independent source, little can be said about its setting and function. It seems likely that the commentator who attempted to give further biblical basis to the theology developed by the original narrative was writing from the same perspective of apocalyptic eschatology, and, if our tentative suggestions with regard to the setting of stratum I are correct, from within the same apocalyptic movement. That a sectarian point of view is being articulated is corroborated by a further observation: that the textus classicus of the holiest festival of the cultic calendar could be dealt with so freely points to an origin outside of the mainstream of temple praxis. This is seen with special clarity when one realizes what this mythologization and eschatologization of the yom kippur ritual implies: the normal means provided by the temple cult for dealing with defilement is implicitly judged ineffectual. A far more drastic means is prescribed. The locus of purgation is transferred from the temple courtyard to the heavenly realm. Even as the origin of evil involved superhuman agents and events and a rebellion in heaven, and even as the continuation of evil in the community bespoke the abiding presence of malevolent spirits, so too the purgation of the community and the healing of the world would involve an act of divine intervention as the final chapter in heavenly conflict. As with stratum I, we are witnessing a harsh indictment against the temple cult and its expository tradition, an indictment originating within the sectarian perspective of a highly developed apocalyptic eschatology. It seems likely that this sort of growth is occurring within an actual apocalyptic movement, though again at this level of the tradition, it is impossible to be specific with regard to the details of parties, issues, and dates. VI. The Teachings of the Rebels: Euhemeristic Elaborations of the Combined Semihazah-Azazel Narrative The Semihazah narrative (amplified by the Azazel episode) traces the origin of evil in the world to the cohabitation of fallen divine beings with the daughters of humanity which resulted in the generation of malevolent offspring and all manner of evil in the world. A further elaboration of this story is found in 8:1-2, 3; 7:16; 9:6, 8c; and 10:7d-8a. Its cardinal theme differs from that of the earlier material by claiming that evil entered the world as the result of secret teachings which certain angels brought with them to pass on to humans. We are faced with another mythic tradition which was widespread in ancient near eastern culture, and which later spread to the Greek and Hellenistic worlds as well, the tradition of antediluvian culture-heroes who introduced the implements and techniques of civilization. Since Prometheus is a late descendant in this tradition of culture-heroes, commentators also in this connection have suggested direct influence of the Prometheus myth on 1 Enoch. It is certainly possible that the readaptation of the Azazel myth to ancient themes also preserved in the Promethean myth abetted the 226</page><page sequence="33">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN assimilation into 1 Enoch 6-11 of materials dealing with the teaching of heavenly secrets. We shall see that this material first impregnated the Azazel stratum (10:7d-8a; 9:6; 8:1-2), and subsequently entered the Semihazah stratum. But an explanation of its introduction merely in terms of a borrowing from the Promethean myth may be incomplete. The possibility of such a borrowing must be cautiously considered within the context of three other important facts: (1) culture-heroes were native to the Semitic world well over a millennium before the first known version of the Promethean myth, and are celebrated in literature reaching from early Babylon to the time of Berossos; (2) the culture-hero tradition is found in Gen 4, which manifests dependence upon early Semitic prototypes;59 (3) long before the composition of 1 Enoch 6- 11, the culture-hero tradition had developed a version which functioned as an etiology of the introduction of evil into the world, that is to say, a version based upon a theme identical with the central concern of the original Semihazah story. Taken together, these facts indicate that the commentator introducing the euhemeristic elaboration had an ancient Semitic tradition to draw upon and found that tradition already incorporated in the biblical text (Gen 4-10) to which the Semihazah-Azazel narrative offered commentary; moreover, it is in keeping with the expository techniques which we have already seen in strata I and II that he further amplified the exposition by incorporating a tradition which like the Semihazah narrative and the yom kippur legend dealt with the theme of evil and defilement in the world. VII. The Antecedent History of the Culture-Hero Tradition A brief sketch of the culture-hero tradition offers the necessary starting point. In myths reaching back to the third millennium B. c. E., preserved in both Sumerian and Akkadian, we read about the emissaries of Ea like Gilgamesh and the apkallus, the sages of old who transmit to humans the secrets which make civilization possible.60 This tradition is preserved also in the old Gilgamesh Epic, in which Utnapishtim took "all the artisans" aboard the ship in the face of the flood, obviously to the end that they could reconstitute a habitable world after the flood (on the basis of the tablets preserving the secrets of civilization).61 This tradition is preserved more completely by Berossos, where the flood incident concludes with the survivors being commanded to return to Sippara to dig up the tablets which had been buried there on order of Kronos (sic) by Xisouthros, in order that those survivors might recreate Babylon.62 Thus, in this ancient, long-lived tradition, the 59W.

The link between this ancient Mesopotamian tradition and the tradition of the protoi heuretai of the Greek-speaking world is to be found in the writings of the priest Sanchuniathon, whose description of Canaanite religion was preserved by Philo Biblos (and in turn by Eusebius). After recounting the several states of theogonic generation, Sanchuniathon turns to a history of culture, where, in good euhemeristic fashion, he traces the various inventions and devices of culture to ancient heroes who had been awarded divine attributes by their grateful clients. The primordial age in question is so distant as to invite confusion between human and divine. For example, "From Genos, son of Aeon and Protogones, were begotten again mortal children, whose names are Light and Fire and Flame. These. . . discovered fire from rubbing pieces of wood together, and taught the use of it. And they begat sons of surpassing size and stature, whose names were applied to the mountains they occupied. . . ." To add to the unclarity of status is the mating practice of that hoary antiquity: "the women in those days had free intercourse with any whom they met."63 At root here is not only the rationalizing attempt to demythologize the old pantheon, replete as it was with contradiction, and offensive to the "enlightened" philosophical mind of the time, but also an etiological concern to account for the various attributes of civilized society. Thus, Sanchuniathon teaches that Agreus introduced hunting, Halieus fishing, Chrysor (Kothar-Hyphaestus) iron and the working of it, as well as incantations and divinations, Agros and Agrotes husbandry, Amyrnos and Magus villages and sheepfolds, Toautus the alphabet, and various other heroes shipbuilding, botany, charms, and the like.64 We shall turn shortly to see how Hesiod applied this tradition of the culture-heroes, but since in his Work and Days the tradition receives a negative twist, we complete the picture of the positive evaluation of theprotoi heuretai by noting how Proticus and then Euhemeros take up the effort with renewed energy and thoroughness, as they laud the contributions of these ancient heroes while denying their divinity. Thus Proticus teaches that these purported gods were once humans, usually ancient rulers who had attained recognition as deities through their teaching the advances of culture to human beings.65 While the lists of inventions and techniques of culture attributed to the culture-heroes in these writers closely resembles the lists in 1 Enoch 8 and corresponding texts, and while the parallel goes further in locating them in primordial times when the lines between gods and humans were yet indistinct, a notable difference divides that tradition from its application in 1 Enoch 6- 63Eusebius, Praep. Ev., I. X. 34d (tr. E. H. Gifford). 64Verbal parallels to these inventions are found in the Greek text of 1 Enoch, lists which in themselves do not suggest a negative interpretation, but which receive a negative twist through the context. 65Cf. W. K. C. Guthrie, The Sophists (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1971) 239-42. 228</page><page sequence="35">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN 11: whereas, for example, in Proticus we find the positive picture of originally human culture-heroes who because of their contributions in upbuilding civilization were given divine attributes by grateful mortals, in the euhemeristic elaboration of Enoch the bene hd'elohim were originally divine beings who were degraded to the rank of mortals because their teaching of heavenly secrets led to a degradation of culture. This negative version of the culture-bringers tradition is not the exclusive one found in the pseudepig- rapha. For example, Jubilees preserves the tradition that the angels were sent by God to earth to "instruct the children of humans to do judgement and uprightness on the earth" (Jub 4:15). Nevertheless, the negative version dominates, and demands explanation. Is it an invention of Enoch, or does it too betray roots in antecedent tradition? 1 Enoch is also drawing upon an ancient version of the culture-bringer tradition, for alongside the long tradition which extends from the ancient apkallu texts to Berossos on the Mesopotamian side, and from Sanchuniathon to Proticus, Euhemeros, Posidonius, Diodoros, and Pliny on the Mediterranean side, there exists an equally long tradition extending from a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian text66 to Gen 4, Josephus and Pseudo-Philo, and from Hesiod to Ovid. If in the former optimistic tradition the culture- heroes, frequently clothed in divine attributes by their beneficiaries, were responsible for the steady progress made in cultural history, in the later pessimistic line their teaching accounts for the steady degeneration of civilized life. The negative application of the culture-hero motif is fully developed in Hesiod's Works and Days in the periodization of history into five world epochs. There, for example, the degeneration occurring in the third period of brass is tied to the use of metal for the production of bronze implements of war, by means of which individuals destroyed each other. This same description of martial devastation is developed by Josephus67 and Ovid.68 This citing of ancient stories is misleading, however, if it suggests that this negative tradition was exclusively extra-biblical, for the same connection between a culture-hero's introduction of bronze and rapid degeneration into violence and bloodshed is found in Gen 4:22-4. And as W. Hallo has demonstrated, the roots of the genealogies in Gen 4 and 5 reach far back into "Mesopotamian traditions of antediluvian sages and antediluvian kings .. ..69 Once again, in the case of the culture-heroes, we have in 1 Enoch 6-11 no simple borrowing from Hellenistic sources, but, as in the case of Josephus, the amplification and interpretation of biblical themes through the use of extra-biblical sources. 66LKA No. 76, published by E.

The Culture-Hero Tradition Applied to I Enoch 6-11 Against the background of this sketch of the culture-hero tradition the third stratum of 1 Enoch 6-11 becomes intelligible. Within stratum II Azazel developed characteristics resembling ancient culture-bringers like the apkallu and Prometheus. Within stratum III the logical next step is taken of explicitly attributing to Azazel the teachings of a culture-hero. This is done plainly and straightforwardly in 8:1 with a list of secrets corresponding to the teachings of Hesiod associated with the age of bronze70 (as well as in Ovid),71 and resembling the activities of Chrysor and his brother in Sanchuniathon (described as siderou euretas kai tes toutou ergasias, a close parallel to 1 Enoch 8:1).72 The list in 8:1 is free from the negative twist which the culture- hero tradition received in the type of world history popularized by Hesiod,73 vividly betraying the origin of this tradition in affirmative interpretation of the significance of the culture-heroes. But as in the other applications of interpretive material in the expository narrative, this tradition is placed within the context of the main theme of the narrative, the corruption of humankind. The teaching of secrets to humans attributed to culture-bringer Azazel thus becomes a parallel motif alongside the motif of the cohabitation of Semihazah and his angels with the daughters of humans. The next stage of growth of the euhemeristic elaboration is found in 8:3 where eight (originally 10?) angels are each credited with specific areas of expertise. Very typical of euhemeristic lore is the etymological derivation of a specific divine being's contribution from his or her name. From this systematic list, the teaching motif came into association with Semihazah, for it included the notation that "Semihazah taught enchantments and root- cuttings." That this association is secondary to the Semihazah material should again be underscored by comparison of 7:1 with 8:1-2. The former (originating in stratum I, but later receiving a stratum III gloss) develops the theme of sexual defilement which was central to the Semihazah narrative, and the reference on the end that Semihazah and his associates "taught them charms and enchantments and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants" is an obvious gloss from the euhemeristic elaboration.74 Conversely, in 8:1-2, the primary theme is the teaching of secrets, with the reference to fornication giving the appearance of a gloss. In the glosses in verses 7:ld and 8:2b, in other words, we see evidences of the attempt to meld the originally distinct themes of sexual defilement and the teaching of secrets. 70Works and Days, 139-55.

I. X. 35c) and Josephus (Ant. VIII, 45) where they are seen as constructive contributions to civilization. 230</page><page sequence="37">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN Further efforts to gloss over the inconsistencies produced by the various stages of development are evident in 9:6, 9:8c, and 10:7d-8a, where the teaching tradition is infused into other parts of the narrative. It is impossible to determine whether this editorial activity stems from the commentator who introduced 8:1-2, or from later editors interested in producing a more homogeneous narrative. To the effort to produce a more homogeneous narrative must be attributed several other features of the final version of 1 Enoch 9:11.75 The structure of the fourfold commands of the Most High to Michael, Sariel, Raphael, and Gabriel (9:1; 10:1, 4, 9, 11) belongs to the latest level of redaction. In the original level of tradition, only Sariel and Michael would have been mentioned in 9:1, followed by the divine command to Sariel in 10:1, and to Michael in 10:11. When the Azazel material was added in 10:4-8 the framework of an angelic command was extended to it (10:4), with Raphael being recruited for that service. The common tendency to group the archangels in numbers of four (or seven) led to the addition of a command to Gabriel in 10:9-10, the secondary nature of which can be detected in the fact that its contents echo in a vague way the contents of the command to Michael within the original Semihazah narrative. Thus it was that the verse introducing the angelic intercessors (9:1) came to include four archangels. Later, in the course of textual transmission, one manuscript tradition (GSYn) altered Sariel and Uriel in 9:1 and 10:1, yielding the popular foursome, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel.76 IX. The Perspective, Setting, and Function of the Euhemeristic Elaboration The addition of the theme of the secret teachings introduced to humanity by certain angels served to develop further the central theme of the defilement of the created order, though it relates the narrative to a tradition which was not originally a part of the ancient rebellion-in-heaven mythic tradition at the core of the original Semihazah narrative, which told of heavenly beings whose rebellious descent to earth led to cohabitation with the daughters of humans, and the procreation of malevolent giants. One inducement toward the application of the euhemeristic theme to the rebellion-in-heaven myth may have been supplied by Gen 4:17-14, where the addition of the Song of Lamech places the Cainite genealogy within an interpretive framework which ties the degeneration of civilization to the introduction of cultural devices by the biblical representatives of the antediluvian culture-heroes. This inducement 75By final version we mean the text as critically reconstructed from the Ethiopic and Greek Gizeh text, for the Greek text of Syncellus represents a further stage of growth which is beyond the scope of our treatment. 76In the sectarian literature of Qumran, this popular foursome dominates as well, except in 1QM 9:14-15, where Michael, Gabriel, Sariel, and Raphael are found, thus offering a very significant parallel to the original text of 1 Enoch 9:1 (cf. Y. Yadin, The Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness [Oxford: Oxford University, 1962] 237-40). 231</page><page sequence="38">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE may have been further abetted by features within the Azazel elaboration which called to mind the culture-heroes of the Greek world like Prometheus. Since the euhemeristic material is found here in the form of secondary elaboration to an earlier story, little can be said about perspective, setting, and function. It too is shaped by the perspective of apocalyptic eschatology, for the teaching of secrets is oriented towards the final judgement of the Most High. To this we may add the observation that the euhemeristic elaboration reaches more extensively than the earlier strata into material which bears the imprint of Greek speculation. Possibly an apologetic motivation is to be discerned on this level of the tradition. Whether this means that the apocalyptic movement in question has become more open to outside influences, or that the expository narrative has been adopted and elaborated by other circles, is perhaps impossible to determine. X. Conclusion 1 Enoch 6-11 thus can be understood as an expository narrative which furnishes a glimpse into one method with which scripture was being interpreted in the late third and second centuries B.C.E. It is a method which, while making the biblical text its point of departure, goes far beyond that text in developing a sectarian explanation of the origin of evil in the world and its ultimate eradication. While the eclecticism with which widely diversified themes and motifs are drawn together is obvious, more noticeable is the overarching unity of structure which is nevertheless achieved. This unity is the result of the basic pattern which underlies the narrative, the archaic pattern of the rebellion-in-heaven myth. That the essential features of this myth can be traced in an unbroken continuum on near eastern soil from the mid-second millennium down to the time of the composition of the Semihazah narrative documents the vitality with which ancient mythic patterns of thought continued to influence the way in which thinkers of later epochs explained the basic tensions which they experienced in the universe. The expository tradition of which 1 Enoch and Pseudo-Jonathan are examples was a living one. 1 Enoch 6-11 itself betrays at least three stages of growth, as the etiology of evil in the world and the vision of its eradication were subjected to elaborative reinterpretation and further grounding in biblical tradition. Other sections of 1 Enoch, as well as other books within the expansive Enochian tradition, could be cited to further illustrate the organic nature of this expository tradition. It becomes very apparent that such expository works expose but a small fraction of the works of a rather significant apocalyptic movement. Further study will be required to shed light on the broader contours of the apocalyptic movement in question, as other pseudepigraphic writings, Daniel, and the Qumran sectarian documents are taken into purview. Briefly to illustrate how such materials can be approached and related, we would cite the further development of the rebellion-in-heaven pattern in the book of Jubilees, which betrays dependence on the final version of 1 Enoch 6-11: (1) 232</page><page sequence="39">HANSON: REBELLION IN HEAVEN The angels of the Lord descend to instruct the children of men (4:16); (2) Instead they defile sexually the daughters of humans and beget three classes of giants which devastate the earth (5:1-2; 7:23-3). (3) The Lord replies in punishment of the evil angels and the humans they have misled (5:3-11). (4) But the eschaton is awaited when God will restore his reign and salom will prevail (5:12). The pattern has developed in certain respects beyond 1 Enoch, as in the development of the Mastema figure, and in the clear division into three classes of giants (a development which is also represented by Syncellus). But these features are clearly developments within a common tradition, a fact which in the case of Jubilees, like the Qumran writings, can be corroborated with many other pieces of evidence. Both on the level of structure and of teaching, therefore, a basic sense of unity is achieved, the structure being unified by the persistence of the rebellion-in-heaven pattern, the teaching by the consistent perspective of apocalyptic eschatology. From this perspective the various materials are made subservient to the Jewish themes of defilement and the need for purification of the defiled creation. Hope resides in an awaited act of the Most High when he would intervene to punish the wicked and preserve the righteous for a blessed idyllic future. Borrowing on all three levels of development is thus assimilated to Jewish themes which stem ultimately from the prophetic eschatology of the classical prophets. These themes, however, live on in 1 Enoch 6-11 and related compositions in a rather thorough metamorphosis, at the heart of which is a new perspective on divine activity, that of apocalyptic eschatology.77 77Appearing in the next issue of JBLwill be an article on 1 Enoch 6-11 by George Nickelsburg, with whom I have exchanged manuscripts at several stages in our writing, and to whom I am grateful for his helpful comments. 233</page></plain_text>
