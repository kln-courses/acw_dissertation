<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychologism and the Novel The Case of Selma Lagerlöf 's Gösta Berlinas saga Lars T. Nylander University of California, Berkeley Man composed his own figure in the interstices of [a] fragmented language. Michel Foucault (386) discussions of the historical emergence of psychological reasoning through the postulation or breaching of psychological inferiority, literary texts are often selected as privileged examples or documents. In such cases, literature is primarily considered in its secondary, belated role of applying principles of psychological charac- terization that already have emerged in the surrounding culture. Much less has been said about the active role literature undoubtedly played in the production of psychological reasoning. It is this production of a logic of the psyche in literature that I here want to highlight by way of the hermeneutic figure or function of psychologism. The function of psychologism can be seen at work in the European novel's first monumental achievement, Don Quixote. While marking both the end of epic-mythic narration and specifically Romanesque principles of narration and the beginning of the novel, it also directly thematizes and dramatizes this shift in representational principles in a self-conscious, ironic fashion that became the hallmark of novelistic discourse.1 Whereas traditional genres "know" nothing about them- selves as genres, about their difference from other genres (they are 1 In the context of the emergence of psychological characterizations one would typically treat the tradition of romances as an autonomous narrative category, separated from older, narrative genres (the epic, legend, myth, etc.) as well as from the later novel. Here, however, we are mainly concerned with the specific qualities of novelistic discourse, not the differences between romance, epic, legend, and other pre-novelistic genres. The novel's three most characteristic features- psychologism, historicism, and the autobio- graphical authenticity- are only suggested in the romance and are almost non-existent in other classic genres. I will therefore include the romance in the broader category of epic- mythic representation, which I define primarily in accordance with Bakhtin's discussion in The Dialogic Imagination (3-40).</page><page sequence="2">4o8 Scandinavian Studies "ideological" in the Althusserian sense of "having no outside55), Don Quixote is a novel precisely because it includes such meta-generic reflection. The way in which Don Quixote dramatizes its difference from the romance is, however, not without a certain mystification. To a high degree, the difference is inscribed in the psychology of the protagonist. The novel, in other words, dramatizes its own difference from the Romanesque tradition in terms of its protagonist's psychological battles between delusionary fantasies and reality. Don Quixote, we learn, has become deranged by reading too many romances. He has lost the ability to distinguish between the dragons of fantasy or fiction and the windmills of reality; or, in other words, he has not yet learned to equate fantasy with romance and reality with the novel. Thus, Cervantes5s novel naturalizes its novelistic representation of reality. That this reality is inhabited by a protagonist who stubbornly continues to act accord- ing to the conventions of the Romanesque world is presented as his - i.e. the protagonist's - confusion. This fact demonstrates how psychologism came to function not merely as one of the explanatory principles in the novel, but more importantly as a meta-principle through which the major differences in representational logic distinguishing epic-mythic from novelistic discourse were bracketed and imploded into the hidden psychological inferiority, the "surplus of humanness55 (Bakhtin 27) with which the novelistic character was equipped. Psychologism is indicative of the general way in which the novel came to frame and incorporate other genres into its own representa- tional and explanatory horizon and thereby subvert the entire system of genre. Taking the novel at its word, it alone speaks about social and objective reality; all non-novelistic forms of representations are instances of magic thinking that, unless novelized, must be epistemologically bracketed by a licentict poetica. The hegemony of novelistic discourse which was gradually estab- lished is evidenced by the way in which the concept of the epic in modern times has been displaced and rendered innocuous. While for the romantics, the term epic denoted a form of narration qualitatively distinct and radically different from the novel, post-romantic criticism neutralized the term into a vague, descriptive category designating any form of broad historical narrative. Epic accordingly became little more than a synonym for narrative making it possible to speak of epic novels. This reluctance to maintain a qualitative distinction between epic and</page><page sequence="3">Gösta Berlings Saga 409 novel should be understood as a symptom of the hegemony of novelis- tic discourse in literary criticism.2 In order to understand the decisive role played by psychologism in the novelization of modern literature and criticism, the rhetorical figurations to which psychologism came to attach itself- prosopopeia and anthropomorphism- must be discussed. Prosopopeia and Anthropomorphism Besides mimesis, the most fundamental literary, aesthetic, or poetic operation has undoubtedly been prosopopeia: to animate, to give a face and voice to inanimate objects or forces by way of apostrophe and personifying analogies. Prosopopeia has been called "the lyric figure" (Riffaterre 112) since lyric discourse is constituted by a weakening of the referential, indicative, and mimetic functions of language and a corre- sponding reinforcement of the performative and evocative that characterize prosopopeia. Although especially significant for lyric discourse, prosopopeia is found in all literary genres and modes of discourse. As Paul de Man has argued, at least one modern prose genre- autobiography- is based in a fundamental way on prosopeia. In the case of autobiography, however, prosopopeia does not imply a weakening of the mimetic and referential function. On the contrary, to categorize a text as autobiographical is to make a judgment about its referential status: "the reader becomes the judge, the policing power in charge of verifying the authenticity of the signature and the consistency of the signer's behavior, the extent to which he respects or fails to honor the contractual agreement he has signed" (de Man 71-2). When de Man describes autobiographical judgment as one in which "[the] specular structure [of subjectivity] has been displaced but not 2 In Germanic languages this redefinition of epic appears to have been accomplished through a semantic doubling of the term; besides signifying a specific narrative genre (early on distinguished as epos), Epik came to signify narrativity as such, in distinction to Lyrik, Dramatik and, for the romantics, Didaktik. An example of the double usage of the term appears in Georg Lukács's Theory of the Novel, where the author talks about "the epic" [i.e. genre] and the novel as "two major forms of great epic [i.e. narrative] literature" (56). The same generalization of the term has taken place in the other European languages; consider for example Ezra Pound's much quoted definition of epic as "a poem including history."</page><page sequence="4">4IO Scandinavian Studies overcome, and we reenter a system of tropes at the very moment we claim to escape from it" (72), we recognize anthropomorphism, which might be described as a subcategory of prosopopeia, in which tropes and rhetorical figurations rather than objects are animated. In contrast to the lyric, autobiography is not so much a genre or discursive mode characterized by prosopopeia as a generic definition founded thereon. Such a definition is, in de Man's view, no definition at all, and autobi- ography, consequently, is "not a genre or a mode, but a figure of reading or of understanding that occurs, to some degree, in all texts" (70). De Man's definition of autobiography as a hermeneutic rather than formal, discursive category highlights the underlying affinity between (auto)biography and the novel, which has often been pointed out by literary historians.3 Of special interest is Bakhtin's demonstration of how novel, biography, and autobiography emerged during late antiq- uity as different realizations of a common, new representational principle : a literary authenticity, in which enunciation is anchored in what he calls "biographical space."4 One might, therefore, argue that autobiography historically emerged as an optional code of reading in conjunction with the representational principles of the novel. Novelistic discourse is a form of autobiographical fiction. The distinction between fictional novels, autobiographical novels, and autobiographies is, consequently, not a generic distinction but a question of modes of reading and verification.5 The long tradition of biographical criticism, as founded on the principle of psychologism, thus, should be understood not as an arbitrary critical convention, but one that naturally emerged as an imaginary supplement to the novel. Biographical criticism exempifies the supplementary role of aesthetic criticism in general, as described by 3 Lukács has argued that, "the outward form of the novel is essentially biographical," (77). Bakhtin has described how the novel first emerged in antiquity along the two lines: adventure novels and biographical novels. As the notion of self and character became displaced (in late antiquity and, in a more thorough and lasting way, in late medieval Europe) from an external and public space to an internal, private space, there was a corresponding formal separation of biography and autobiography (esp. 133-46). 4 Novelistic representation does not require prose as Bakhtin makes clear when talking about "excellent novels in verse" (9). The same can be said of autobiographical readings, as Paul de Man demonstrates with his reading of Wordsworth (72-81). 5 Once the autobiographical principle is established, it can be applied to any text, a possibility that makes clear that it is a hermeneutic rather than a generic category. Historically, however, the autobiographical mode of reading emerged in conjunction with the new, discursive practice of novelistic prose. For discussions of the discursive qualities of early prose, see Kittay and Godzich and Nylander 27-42.</page><page sequence="5">Gösta Berlings Saga 411 film critic Christian Metz: "the discourse of the object [. . .] insidiously comes to occupy the place of discourse about the object" (5). PSYCHOLOGISM Psychologism should, then, be understood as an augmentation and expansion of anthropomorphism, through which it is connected to the conceptual field and principles of psychology. More detail is provided in de Man's description of anthropomorphism. "Anthropomorphism" is not just a trope but an identification on the level of substance. It takes one entity for another and thus implies the constitution of specific entities prior to their confusion [....] It is no longer a proposition but a proper name, as when the metamorphoses in Ovid's stories culminate and halt in the singleness of a proper name [....] The apparent enumeration is in fact a foreclosure. The tendency to move from tropes to systems of interpretation such as anthropomor- phism is built into the very notion of trope [....] It is easy enough to cross the barrier that leads from trope to name but impossible, once this barrier has been crossed, to return from it to the starting-point. (241-2) Anthropomorphism, accordingly, effectuates an irreversible move from trope to proper name/entity/substance. But the entity thus named- as, for example, Narcissus- is not yet a psychological character. The name refers thus far merely to the metamorphosis as such i.e. Narcissus is just the entity which has been transformed from man to flower. At this moment, however, psychologism may enter the no longer rhetorical play. By assigning a psychological, narcissistic interiority to this entity, one creates a textual (fore)closure through which the entire pre- ceding chain of tropic substitutions- everything leading up to the anthropomorphic leap- retrospectively can be read as effects of pro- cesses that primarily exist within this entity. The textual logic of tropes is hereby transformed into the logic of psyche: tropes, tropic substitu- tions, and narrative functions implode into the eclipsed space of psychological interiority to reappear as instances of repression, associa- tions, ambiguities, and conflicts.6 In other words, conflicts and 6 Compare Harold Bloom's effort to return from name to trope and to re-tropologize the psychologism of romantic poetry and criticism through a system of equivalences between tropes and ego-psychological defense mechanisms. Although Bloom's model clarifies many (inter)textual mechanisms, it cannot but create new ambiguities, especially concerning the notion of author, something which his distinction between strong and weak poets indicates.</page><page sequence="6">412 Scandinavian Studies contradictions on the textual level are homogenized as the positive signs or expressions of conflicts within a (hidden) psyche.7 Through this imaginary spacing of anthropomorphism, the reader is able to project his or her own uncertain experience of difference and interiority (vis-à-vis the text) upon the anthropomorphic figure. Reader and character (including the narrator-character) reciprocally produce and sustain each other. The effect of this imaginary logic, where each psychological entity-as-space only exists through the way it reflects itself in and through an other, is that while named entities are formally delimited from each other all in fact become interchangeable. Selma LagerlöPs Gösta Berlinas saga (1891) stands out as one of the most famous efforts to incorporate an oral tradition of epic-mythic storytelling into the nineteenth-century novel. Although it does not always succeed, criticism has tried to cover up its internal contradic- tions. The novel's great success, however, has more to do with the way it fails to become thoroughly a novel and dramatizes by this failure the principal differences between epic-mythic and novelistic discourse. The Author-Narrator Figuration in Gösta Berlinas saga Few Swedish novels have been and still remain so forcefully subjected to the psychologist identification of narrator and author as Gösta Berlinas saga (hereinafter: GBS). As recently as 1976, Erland Lagerroth argued that throughout the novel narrator and author constituted an indis- soluble unity. Nonetheless, he insisted that the novel's closing remarks unambiguously could and should be read as "forfattarinnans avskedstaP [the author's parting words] (153).8 Rather than being taken as extrinsic to the work itself, this elastic, ambiguous identification should be understood as an important intrin- 7Psychologism became especially prominent in New Criticism. One famous example is the way in which Cleanth Brooks tried to redefine the linguistic and logical paradox as the positive representation of (a unified intention to express) psychological ambiguity. Paradoxes in poetry were hereby recuperated as the signs of a unified intention, exempli- fying his general dictum of "Single Nature's double name" (10, 20). 8 Lagerroth has prepared the way for this by first indicating the problem of separating the two: "författarinnan eller berätterskan- de star alltsâ varandra nära här" [the author or the narrator- the two are so close to each other here]. The similarity is later transformed into the compound concept of "författarinnan-berätterskan" [author-narrator] (147).</page><page sequence="7">Gösta Berlings Saga 413 sic and consciously intended effect of the novel's structural organiza- tion. LagerlöPs novel recounts a number of semi-autonomous stories that take place during a year of carnevalesque chaos in Varmland during the late 1820s. The narrative frame is a story about the Major's wife, the representative of patriarchal law and order, whose social power is taken over by a group of retired cavaliers. In a Dionysian hedonistic frenzy, they turn the region into the stage for heroic, romantic, tragic, and pathetic adventures before social order can once again be reinstated at the end of the year. Within this frame, Lagerlöf inserts semi-legendary stories taken over from the regional tradition of storytelling as well as from the storehouse of literary romanticism. The task of harmonizing this heterogeneous work with all the ten- sions between different principles of narration that it incorporates comes to rest solely on the figure of the narrator as an authentic image of the person and writer Selma Lagerlöf. The narrator's project of saving the tradition of storytelling of her childhood region by writing it down gives to the text a strong subjective character by means of which every kind of contradiction can be explained in terms of the narrator's personal conflicts. The novel's success, thus, came to depend on the willingness of the reader to accept this author-narrator configuration. And once it had been established in public consciousness, Selma Lagerlöf could do nothing but reinforce it by taking on this imago as her public persona, in spite of the fact that she never used exactly this narrator-character in any of her subsequent works. "Selma Lagerlöf havde kanoniseret sig selv som myte allerede mens hun levede" [Selma Lagerlöf canonized herself as a myth while still alive], Henrik Wivel recently remarked without directly relating the mythic quality of her public persona to the narrator in GBS (271). This notwithstanding, an obvious incongruity exists between the narrator and the woman who wrote her. At the time of the publication of the novel, Lagerlöf was thirty- three years old. Although the age of the narrator is never stated, we are led to conceive of her as significantly older. The narrative situation is set up as the continuation, in writing, of a weakened, regional tradition of oral storytelling. The narrator de- scribes herself as once being one of "de smâ [som] sutto pâ lâga pallar kring sagberätterskan med det vita hâret" [the little ones [who] sat on low stools around an old nurse with white hair]9 and thus was intro- duced to and initiated into the regional heritage. It is this institution of 9 Translations are principally mine, although I have in some instances made use of Roberts Bl^s translation The Story of Gösta Berlinß.</page><page sequence="8">414 Scandinavian Studies oral narration that she now wants to save by passing along its old and almost forgotten legends to "sena riders barn" (164) [children of a later day], which, of course, were not children at all, but her contemporary adult readers. This image of the narrator as an elderly woman is rein- forced by her intimacy with "Döden befriaren55 [Death, the Releaser], whom she evokes in Gnostic terms as her waiting groom. The writing of the book, moreover, is thus portrayed as the narrator's final desire in life - a representation not congruent with the fact that the novel was the beginning of a writing career. Paradoxically, this incongruity may reinforce rather than resist the basic psychologism of the work. GBS belongs to that group of nine- teenth-century realistic novels whose constitutive feature Fredric Jameson has called "authorial wish-fulfillment" which are structurally defined as works in which "the working distinction between biographi- cal subject, Implied Author, reader, and characters is virtually effaced.55 The purpose of this all-encompassing psychologism is, as Jameson writes, "to restore the coordinates of a face-to-face storytelling institution which has been effectively disintegrated by the printed book and even more definitively by the commodification of literature and culture55 (155). In Balzac, whose works are the prime subject of Jameson's discus- sion, this psychologism is established by proto-naturalistic descriptions of libidinally charged objects, through which character, author, and reader are unified as subject of the objectified desire. In LagerlöPs text, a similar universal subject position is established through the very different strategy of evoking the situation of oral storytelling. To be a subject is, in the context of GBS, to be- or to have been- the child listening to stories. In this primal scene of social initiation, Lagerlöf, the implied author, the narrator, the characters, as well as every reader of GBS are all subjected to the culturally coded desires vis-à-vis the objects, events, and characters depicted in the text. Individual differences be- come secondary depending on the different ways in which individuals later try to repeat this primal scene: by reading, by enacting the content of the stories (Gösta and the cavaliers), or by rewriting them (author and narrator). This universalized child-reader makes it possible for the narrator to address her readers as "you children.55 Distancing oneself from this figure, one immediately becomes aware of a number of dichotomies and contradictions that it eclipses which are all subsumed under the general difference between epic-mythic and novelistic discourse.</page><page sequence="9">Gösta Berlings Saga 415 Taxes in Search of a Voice The creative conception and emergence of GB S is a well known and an often repeated story, primarily based on Lagerlöf 's own account in En saga om en saga [A Tale of a Tale] from 1902. This tale, told in the third person, has the same mixture of historicity and myth as the novel. Facts about the novel's background have been inscribed in an allegoric narra- tive centered around the anthropomorphism of the tale as a preexisting entity in search of someone to voice it to the world. For a long time, we are told, the tale existed in the mind of the author merely as the vague idea of writing about her childhood region of Varmland. Subsequently the project centered on the cavaliers and, in their midst, the defrocked priest Gösta Berling. He can be described as a combination of Thomas Carlyle's historicized hero-figure and the more demonic hero-poet of the romantic tradition to which Lagerlöf added a certain twist of her own.10 In spite of the fact that her prelimi- nary title for the work was "Gösta Berling, poeten" [Gösta Berling, The Poet], which survived as the title for one of its chapters, Gösta never wrote poetry. He is a poet solely by having "upplevat fiera poem, an andrà skalder har skrivit" [experienced more poems than other poets have written] (54). Thus, Lagerlöf can actually be said to decompose rather than reinforce the compound notion of hero-poet, something that accords well into her general description of how modern culture has destroyed the possibility of being a hero of action, leaving us children to choose between writing or reading heroic tales.11 For many years, Lagerlöf writes, the only story she had clearly in her mind was the Christmas-night event. She first tried it out as a verse narrative, then as a play, and only much later, when her friends at the journal Dagny recommended that she try prose, as a short story. Subse- 10 In his treatise, On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1841), with which Lagerlöf was well acquainted, Thomas Carlyle postulated a Hero of History who apart from his Divine appearance also appeared in the secular roles of Poet, Priest, Man of Letters, and King. 11 There are other optional readings ot this figure. Birgitta Holm has suggested that Gösta functions on one level as a personification of "sj älva det urbegär som 'skriver* romanen" [the very primordial desire which "writes" the novel] ; it is thus "en saga som skrivs av Gösta Berling" (98) [a tale that is being written by Gösta Berling]. The connection between Gösta and the narrator could also be read as a way of assigning a heroic quality to the act of writing: if Gösta is a poet solely by way of his heroic actions, then the narrator by implication can be considered a hero solely by writing about heroic acts.</page><page sequence="10">4i6 Scandinavian Studies quently it came to be used as a narrative frame, an episode that marks the beginning of the carnevalesque year and creates a space for the multitude of minor stories she wanted to include in one single work. Turning to prose, Lagerlöf first wrote in the fashionable naturalistic style, but without much success. The first prose piece she sent to Dagny was returned with the comment: "Innehallet- gudomligt! Stilen- avskyvärd!" [The content- divine! The style- horrible!] (Gullberg "Stil" 15). 12 The final turn came when she in the spring of 1890 decided to give herself up to romantismen [romanticism], which more precisely meant a highly lyrical style. This style implied, in her own words, not being afraid of "de starka orden, utropen, frâgorna, apostroferingarna" [the energetic words, the exclamations, the questions, the apostrophes] and writing "med manga ack och o i en prosa, som nära nog var rytmisk" [with many an alas and o in a prose that was nearly rhythmic] (Lagerlöf, En Saga om en saga, 12 f.).13 The tale had finally found its voice. Critics have generally characterized this new style as "the typical Gösta Berling-style."14 What neither Lagerlöf nor her critics have emphasized- naturally enough, given their strong identification of narrator and author- is how the change of style implied the more substantial change of supplying the anthropomorphism of the narra- tive voice with a character (the narrator) and a scene of writing. As Lagerlöf rewrote earlier versions of the stories, words that had been spoken by fictional characters could now be taken over by the narrator. 15 The new stories came to include many passages in which the narrator reflects on herself and her relationship to the stories. The first 12The original prose version of the chapter "Gösta Berling, poeten" is, as Helge Gullberg has concluded, not available ("Hur Gösta Berlines saga växte fram" 24). 13 LagerlöP s new style was influenced partly by Carlyle's The French Révolution, partly by poets like Johan Ludvig Runeberg, Viktor Rydberg, and Verner von Heidenstam. For stylistic comparisons, see Vessby 163-95. 14 Helge Gullberg writes about "den typiska Gösta Berling-stilen med utrop och fragor och apostroferingar av lasaren" ("Stil" 74). 15 The chapters Lagerlöf first wrote in her new style (the sequence of their production does not coincide with their position in the finished work) has been established by Gullberg (27-39; 130 n. 90). They are in the order in which they were written (in parenthesis, their final numerical position within the novel's thirty six chapters): "Kyrkogârden" ["The Graveyard"] (26) ; "Amor vincit Omnia" (31) ; "Livets stigar" ['The Roads of Life"] (15); "Nygârdsflickan" ['The Girl from Nygârd"] (32); "La cachucha" (5); (Brobyprästen" ["The Broby Priest"] (22); "Döden befriaren" ["Death, the Re- leaser"] (28); "Gösta Berling, poeten" ["Gösta Berling, the Poet"] (4); "Ebba Dohnas historia" ["Ebba Dohna's Story"] (12); and "Spökhistorier" ["Ghost Stories"] (11).</page><page sequence="11">Gösta Berlings Saga 417 ten chapters Lagerlöf wrote in the new style during spring and summer of 1890 show how the narrator gradually took up more space and grew in importance. Only in the last among these, "Spökhistorier," did the scene of narration explicitly become a scene of writing. In En saga om en saga, Lagerlöf writes that what the author had to await before she could write her book (i.e. what the tale had to await before she was ready to serve as its medium) was the arrival of "sig själv" [herself]. The metaphor should be read in a strict Lacanian sense: what Lagerlöf (in her retrospective rationalization of the process) was wait- ing for was an other, a narrator, to stand in (the text) for/as her "self?516 The function of this narrator was to breach a psychological space that, much like a system of communicating vessels, could transfer content between character, narrator, and reader and thereby appropri- ate and harmonize principal differences and contradictions between epic-mythic and novelistic representation. Although this often has been the function of the novelistic narrator, few novels reveal it as blatantly as GBS. Epic-Mythic versus Historical Past The most obvious problem Lagerlöf faced with her intention to write "en hel trakts roman [som] skall bli ett väldigt epos" [a novel of an entire region (that) will become a giant epic] (Lagerlöf, Brev 54) concerned the status of the past. In epic-mythic narration, the past is not histori- cally situated; it has no continual temporal-spatial relation to the present. There is, as Bakhtin points out about the epic, an "[absolute] distance separating the [represented] world from contemporary reality" (13). The epic world is a once-and-for-all closed and finished world that can be repeated and varied in unlimited ways but whose fundamental values and meanings cannot be changed by an individual author. The modern concept of author is, therefore, really not applicable to epic-mythic genres. 16 She writes: "Och eftersom det säkert skulle komma att dröja länge, innan hon künde vinna sitt uppehälle som författarinna, behövde hon lära sig nâgot, skaffa sig en levnadsställning, sä att hon hade ett brödstycke att leva av, medan hon väntade pâ sig själv" (Brev 8) [And since it would probably take a long time before she could earn her living as a writer, she had to learn something, find a position, so as to earn her daily bread while she was waiting for her self].</page><page sequence="12">4i8 Scandinavian Studies On the contrary, the novel is anchored in historical time, in a "zone of maximal contact with the present (with contemporary reality) in all its openendedness," as Bakhtin writes (n). The scene of representation, no matter how far away in time and place, is continuously connected to the historical present. As a consequence, the very act of writing the text, wholly absent from the logic of epic-mythic representation, comes to occupy the center of the novel's representational logic. The novel is a text that is undersigned and dated, i.e. it makes (its) sense only as written by an individual in a precise historical situation. (Hence the modern obsession with dating and attribution of anonymous texts.) It is a center that, regardless of any effort to take mimetic control of it by including a scene of writing, will necessarily remain something of a hole in the symbolic texture, an opening to the real. This symbolic non-closure- or authenticity- makes every novel a potential autobio- graphical document. Lagerlöf s epic world is situated in a precise historical time and place: Varmland in the late 1820s. Whenever the conflict between epic- mythic and historical logic clash, Lagerlöf tries to harmonize them through a historical or psychological strategy. In the chapter "Balen pâ Ekeby" [The Ball at Ekeby], a highly self-conscious, playful technique is used. The chapter opens with an emotionally charged apostrophe by the narrator: "O, forna tiders kvinnor!" [O, women of bygone times!] and closes with the declaration: "detta är berättelsen om hur ännu en av er gav Gösta Beding sin kärlek" [this is the story of how one more of you gave your love to Gösta Berling] (68). Some ten pages into the chapter, a dinner-scene is described where Gösta "höll tal for er, forna tiders kvinnor35 [gave a speech to you, women of bygone times], a speech that word for word repeats the narrator's earlier apostrophe. The obvious purpose of this repetition, whose textual sequence stun- ningly contradicts the chronology on the level of the story (as if Gösta has overheard the narrator and mockingly imitates her), is to show the narrator and Gösta's common subjection to a cultural tradition. Both give a speech that has no author other than tradition itself. The principal contradiction between this traditionalism based on an epic-mythic once- upon-a-bygone-time and the historical placing of Gösta's "bygone times" in the 1820S is easily absorbed into the notion of an all-encompassing tradition. A more clumsy contradiction occurs in the chapter "Dovres häxa" [The Witch of Dovre]. After telling the story about how the witch</page><page sequence="13">Gösta Berlings Saga 419 drove countess Marta mad, the narrator comments: "Vansinnig kan val ocksâ derma berättelse synas, men den mäste dock vara sann. Hundratais ska känna igen den och vittna, art sâdan är den gamia sägnen" (254) [This story may also seem mad, but it is evidently true as well. Hun- dreds will recognize it and bear witness that this is the old account]. First Lagerlöf uses insanity as a psychologism for what is historically untrue implying that only a (Don Quixotian?) madman could take it to be accurate. She then counters with the argument, taken from the traditionalist logic of oral narratives, that the story is true because it is an accurate version of how the story always has been told. The text tries to reconcile historicity and traditionalism by raising the truth of oral narration as an argument against the historical untruth of the described events, an effort that becomes somewhat difficult to digest. Epic versus Novelistic Character Gösta Berling kan sta sig till och med infór en mycket bortskämd lasare, som ur sin eßet inreßiver honom den utsöktaste kryddan; da skapas en kentaur. (Gösta Berling can satisfy also a very spoiled reader, who from within conjures up the most exquisite spice to bestow upon him; thus a centaur is created) Edith Södergran, "Brokiga iakttagelser." (124) The characters in GBS could be placed along a continuum from epic- mythic to novelistic, psychological. Characters like the forest woman and the witch of Dovre are fully mythical, while, at the other end, Elisabeth and Marianne are coherently depicted as psychological char- acters. More commonly, though, as Vivi Edström has remarked, "figures alternate between mythical and realistic roles, sometimes in a mystify- ing way55 (27). The general principle for this alternation is, however, quite simple: figures are presented as psychological characters endowed with a mythic persona. The logic thus follows a masquerade metaphor: people play or enact mythic figures while their innermost selves, their true faces behind their masks, remain psychological. In this way, the principal distinction between the two modes of characterization is obliterated or, at least, masked as the psychological dichotomy of inte- riority versus exteriority. In her use of the mask metaphor, Lagerlöf repeats what historically was one of the common strategies of making the transition from epic- mythic to novelistic character. As Bakhtin has pointed out, the epic</page><page sequence="14">42O Scandinavian Studies character is as such "complete," "absolutely equal to himselP in terms of his fate and position as narrative agent. His "humanness [is] entirely externalized" in his actions, words, and behavior (34). The novelistic character, on the other hand, never fully coincides with his actions and narrative function. He is always more or less than his narrative role, always marked by the "surplus of humanness" established by anthropo- morphism and psychologism. Bakhtin points out that the mask was an important metaphor to dramatize and accomplish the transition from the one to the other, since it suggested an infinite surplus. The distinc- tion between mask and face indicated, by way of analogy, that the face also masked a hidden interiority, a psychologized soul.17 One example of this logic in GBS is Major's wife, who is introduced as a mythic mother figure. This identity is, however, immediately cor- rected by her life story and its socio-psychological conflicts, which reveal her Amazonie appearance to be a mere defensive mask. Her story explains her split personality- formalized as the distinction between her maiden name/identity Margareta Celsing and Majorskan (Major's wife) - as the effect of her unwilling marriage to the Major. Her mythic persona as "den mäktigaste frun i Värmland" [the most powerful wife/ lady in Värmland] thus simultaneously designates and masks her sub- jection and servitude to a patriarchal system. The contingent, merely executive nature of her social power is soon disclosed by her sudden disempowerment (by which the cavaliers come to reign), when her infidelity to the Major is made public. The cavaliers are all marked by a similar split. They are portrayed as old, weak men pathetically escaping their true identities by hiding behind heroic images of themselves as forever young adventurers. The most apparent example of this psychologization of the difference be- tween epic-mythic mask and novelistic face is, however, Sintram, the evil or wicked master of the iron foundries. In accordance with the epic-mythic code, Sintram has made a pact with the devil, with whom he is sometimes directly identified. In the chapter entitled "Spökhistorier" [Ghost stories], Sintram's wife returns home one evening to find the devil himself sitting in her husband's 17 This is, of course, not exactly what Bakhtin had in mind. His term "surplus of humanness" did not, in his perspective, primarily indicate a psychological surplus, but a discursive one; to Bakhtin, the novelistic character was fundamentally a figure of speech, not a psychological being. But, as I here argue, it is precisely as a figure of speech that the novelistic character became anthropomorphized, by readers and authors alike.</page><page sequence="15">Gösta Berlings Saga 421 rocking chair. After telling this and related stories about Sintram, the narrator calms her readers by assuring them that these stories "kunna inte vara annat an lögn och dikt" [could be nothing but lies and poetry]. "But" she immediately corrects herself: Àngern, som vaggar fram och ater over hjärtat, tills dess detjämrarsig, som golvplankorna i Sintrams saljämrade sig under den vaggande meden, men tvivlet, som ringer fór öronen, sãsom bjällrorna ringde for Anna Stjärnhök i den öde skogen, när bli de till lögn och dikt? (175) 18 (The anxiety, swinging back and forth within our hearts until it mourns like the floor board in Sintram's hall, and the doubts, jingling in our ears like the bells jingled for Anna Stjärnhök in the desolate forest, when will these be nothing but lies and poetry?) The historical reality of the stories is first denied, after which the state- ment is contradicted by the reality of the horror they create in the mind of the universal child-reader as stories. Once again, an argument from one reality principle is countered by an argument from another. Parallel with and in sharp contradiction to this mythical portrait of Sintram is his portrayal as a psychological character, a person, deprived of love, who has reinvested all his passions in hate. "Smaningom hade han lärt sig själv att älska allt fuit och uselt. Han var mer vansinnig an den vildaste gaining, men detta förstod ingen" (258) [Gradually he had taught himself to love everything ugly and deformed. He was more insane than the most raging lunatic, but this no one understood]. Although these two characterizations of Sintram emerge from the two representational systems to which he simultaneously belongs, the psy- chological principle of novelistic discourse appropriates the contradiction by interpreting it in terms of face and mask. The psychological Sintram is the real person who merely pretends, imagines, and is perceived by others to have made a pact with the devil which Lagerlöf most bril- liantly dramatizes this when Sintram, in the introductory story of the Christmas night, visits the drunk cavaliers masquerading as the devil. Due to the cavalier's boyish cooperation, Sintram's theatrical perfor- mance exerts the same effects as if he had actually been the devil or his servant. Here, Lagerlöf refrains from trying to synthesize the historical 18 The equivalence between the bells and the story's impact on the reader refers back to a situation where Anna, driving her horse-sled through the night, heard the bells of another horse sled following her, although nothing could be seen; it was the invisible sled of Sintram or possibly the devil.</page><page sequence="16">422 Scandinavian Studies and mythical logic; they remain separated, superimposed, as two equally valid and necessary readings. In the case of Gösta, the opposition between epic-mythic persona and real (novelistic, psychological) face is given a playful, theatrical interpretation. His famous scenes of seduction always enact highly coded, romantic scenarios, most explicitly when he and Marianne Sinclair fall in love during a theatrical performance. In a series of pageants they stage, their artistic representation of passion comes to mask the passion it simultaneously triggers. Because of the strong theatrical quality of Gösta's actions and emotions, he is incapable of making his passions endure; he falls out of love or inspiration as soon as the situation that triggered it fades- much as Don Quixote in the end falls out of his imaginary world of romances and into the reality of the novel. In the end of her kaleidoscopic novel, after the mythic persona of the Major's wife has been abolished and Margareta Celsing has reappeared, Lagerlöf also tries to humanize Gösta by turning him into a modern citizen subjected to critical self-observation rather than heroic action, to an ethic of work, and to social order rather than the erotic hedonism. Here, the anthropomorphism of historicism is again employed to ap- propriate the transition from epic-mythic to novelistic narrative. The logic of linear, historical progression turns into an allegory about the maturation of man from a primitive, non-reflective, acting, and epic hero to a modern, reflecting, passive, and novelistic individual. Writing and Death The anthropomorphism of history understood as the maturation of man is primarily evident in the tragic vision of man's fall from action to paralyzing self-observation, which becomes most explicit in the chapter "Auktionen pâ Björne" [The Auction at Björne]. "Tankte aldrig den tidens människor pâ vad de gjorde?" (113) [Did the people in those days never think of what they were doing before they did it? (Bly 97)] the narrator recalls she and her puzzled playmates used to ask the old storytellers. She goes on to explain: vi, [tankte] pà själviakttagelsens underliga ande, som redan hade h allùsiti intag i vart inre. Vi tankte pâ honom med isògonen och de langa, krokiga fingrarna, han, som sitter dar inné i s ja' lens mörkaste vrâ och plockar sonder vârvarelse....

We had in mind the one who sits in our minds with icy eyes and long, crooked fingers, he, who sits in the mind's darkness and tears apart our being.. ..) Marianne is described as one of the few persons in bygone times who had already fully "upplâtit sin själ for anden med isögonen" (114) [opened her soul to the spirit with cold eyes]. She thus figures as the evolutionary link between the people of former times who acted rather than pondered the consequences of their acts and contemporary char- acters who are victims of a self-scrutiny that has made them unfit for heroic deeds. Subjected to this sadistic super-ego, reality inevitably turns unreal, as clearly had happened to Marianne: "Hermes liv hade blivit till ett skâdespel, dar han [själviakttagelsens ande] var den enda âskâdaren. Hon var inte människa mer, hon led inte, gladdes inte, älskade inte" (114) [her entire life had become a play, with him (the spirit of self reflection) as the sole spectator. She was not human any- more, she did not suffer, felt no joy, no love]. Marianne serves as an historical prototype. With the exception of the few purely mythic figures, the division of the self that characterizes her marks every character in GBS, although in more lenient forms. The pre- historic era it depicts is, precisely, the beginning of the metamorphosis of epic characters into novelistic characters, brought about by the characters' growing inability to be absolutely equal to themselves and their actions. Modern man is, in LagerlöPs historical allegory, born with an increasing inhibition toward action and a logic that implies that reality is transformed from a scene of action to a scene of fiction and fantasy. Consequently, when Marianne loses Gösta's love- the one thing that had the power to counteract her modern fate- and an inhibiting serf-reflection completely takes possession of her, she turns into a poet. Read together, the old women storytellers of the narrator's childhood, Gösta, Marianne, and the narrator constitue an allegorical lineage from the hero-poet of bygone times to the tragic, alienated poet of modern times, for whom heroism has never existed anywhere else than in stories of the past. This (hi)story of man's tragic maturation is closely associated with the transition from oral to written poetry. Marianne is the first in this allegorical sequence to isolate herself in the activity of writing poems instead of enacting them in deeds or oral performances. The underlying</page><page sequence="18">424 Scandinavian Studies equation of self-observation, writing, and death is made explicit in the narrator's recognition that Marianne shares her intimate relation with death, which sets her apart from the other women in her past. When describing a scene in which Marianne, overcome by the grief of having been driven out of her father's house, lies down in the snow to die, the narrator is immediately reminded of her own future groom: O, Död, bleka van! [...] O,fórlossare! [ . . . ]jag drömmer med en rysning av vällust om den stund, da jag ska upptagas i ditt rike. Bleka van, mot mig ma dufritt over din styrka, men jag säßer dig det: bardare var dig kampen mot deforna tidernas kvinnor. Livets krafter voro starka i deras smarta kroppar, ingen hold kunde kyla deras beta blod. (82) (O, Death, pale friend! [...JO, savior! [. . .] I dream in a shiver of bliss of the moment when I am to be received into your kingdom. Pale friend, you can easily exert your power over me, but I tell you: your struggle was harder against the women of bygone times. The forces of life were strong in their slender bodies, no cold could freeze their warm blood.) GBS ends with an anecdote about "fantasiens jättebin" [the great bees of imagination] and the problem of "hur de ska komma in i verklighetens kupa" (406) [how they are to squeeze into the beehive of reality] , a problem which is ironically dismissed with the words : "det far de sannerligen se sig om" (a colloquialism whose meaning Bly captures with the phrase: "a problem they will have to solve by themselves" [Lagerlöf The Story 310]). Finally, then, the narrator appears laconically to admit to the impossibility of her attempt to squeeze the epic-mythic principle of legends into a novelistic principle of psychological and historical realism. What she does not have to explicate, since it is embodied in the bees, is that she from the outset has privileged such oversized stories which are bound to resist this enclosure. The obvious purpose of the anecdote is to leave the reader with the impression that the narrator has achieved precisely what she wanted: saving the bees of imagination from the dry reality principle of modern times. To some extent, of course, this is also what she has done in the sense of having emphasized the tensions between epic-mythic and novelistic representation. But, as the discussion should have made clear, the powerful elasticity of novelistic principles such as historicism and psychologism- which so easily are able to appropriate every non-nov- elistic mode of representation as an exotic, childish, or primitive aspect</page><page sequence="19">Gösta Berlings Saga 425 of its own reality principle- make the result of her efforts (and, retroac- tively, the true face of her intention) highly ambiguous. PSYCHOLOGISM IN THE CRITICISM OF GBS Although Bakhtin used the term novelization solely to characterize the way in which novelistic principles have penetrated and transformed other literary genres, the term could also be used to describe a parallel change in literary criticism. Modern criticism has been less a criticism of the novel than a novelized criticism which, by naturalizing the novel's representational principles, has turned itself into a supportive agent for the novel. The four critical texts I will comment on here are not only representative of the general critical treatment of LagerlöPs novel, but also of the general way in which literary criticism came to internalize the principles of novelistic discourse. Critics have, of course, always recognized the tensions between epic- mythic and novelistic traits in GBS. Of special interest is Oscar Levertin, who, in an essay on Lagerlöf (1903) described GBS as a mixture of "en gammaldags saga [och] en gammaldags roman" [an old-fashioned tale (and) an old-fashioned novel], whose basic technique consisted of "ett beständigt antropomorfiserande, ett beständigt förmänskligande af det hon talar om, natur, ting, lifsmakter, saväl som abstrakta begrepp" [a continual anthropomorphization, a continual personification of what- ever she talks about, nature, things, and forces of life as well as abstract concepts].19 He emphasized the generic differences between saga and novel and was skeptical of Lagerlöf 's effort to unify them: "Hermes försök att tvinga samman alia sagor och berättelser inom en given ram äro ocksâ mycket tafatta" [Her efforts to force together all tales and stories within a given frame is also very awkward] . Furthermore, he insisted that "om âtskilligt i en sâdan sinnesfbrfattning verkligen är primitivi är âtskilligt âter sentimental konstruktion, just kännetecknande csena tiders barn555 (270-1) [if much in such a state of mind is, indeed, primitive, much is also a sentimental construction, characterising, pre- 19 Levertin uses the term anthropomorphism as a synonym for personification, where one presumes that what is being anthropomorphized/personified is pre-existing, inor- ganic entities, things, or abstracts but never textual-rhetorical figures as such. In spite of his negative attitude towards LagerlöPs personifications, Levertin thus readily accepts and reinforces the psychologism of narrator-author, by discussing the novel's technique in terms of the author's "sinnesfbrfattning" (state of mind).</page><page sequence="20">426 Scandinavian Studies cisely, "children of later times"]. In other words, characteristic of the novel, not earlier forms of narration.20 Because subsequent criticism has not maintained this distinction between novelistic and epic-mythical forms of narration, the critical discourse on GBS has gradually come to enforce the homogenizing tendency of the work. The contradictions between epic-mythic and novelistic principles- which have been treated by many critics as syn- onymous with the opposition between romantic and realist principles- have been described in more harmonious terms, as "den motor som driver verket framât" (Lagerroth 158) [the engine that drives the work] or as a "kombination [av] myt och verklighet" (Edström 18) [combination (of) myth and reality]. The supportive function of criticism becomes apparent in an article by Elsa Olsen-Buchner entitled "Vestiges of the Epic in the Narrative Techniques of Gösta Berlinas Saga. " Leaning on the conventional usage of the term epic and without offering any specific definition of the novel, Olsen-Buchner's argument becomes thoroughly confused. She characterizes the "heroic epic tradition" by its "strength and sense of history," and by a "heterogeneity" that "draws from epic tradition, other narrative forms, from historical sources, and employs a great variety of style and tone" (88, 97). In other words, her characterization of the epic repeats almost literally Bakhtin's characterization of the novel advanced as a contrast to the homogeneity and monologic char- acter of epic discourse. When Olsen-Buchner goes on to summarize the novel as "an epic, unified by time and place" (92), it is evident that she is not describing any epic-mythic form of narration at all, but precisely hybrid forms of epic novels. The same problems are evident in more sensible critical treatments of LagerlöPs novel such as in Vivi Edström's book Selma Lagerlöf. Edström clearly recognizes the conflicting representational principles 20Levertin emphasized how Lagerlöf, faithful to the bourgeoisie tradition, would "ansia de starkaste dissonanser men ändock alltid upplösa dem i harmoni" [strike the strongest discords but still always resolve them into harmony] (265-8). Similar critiques were mounted by other critics. While George Brandes in his review recommended that Lagerlöf keep more unequivocally to psychological storytelling, Karl Warburg recom- mended that she keep more unequivocally to the mythic material. If these contemporary critiques of GBS were to a some extent motivated by a general aesthetic conservatism, they nevertheless show how criticism at the end of the nineteenth century had not yet become so novelized as to lose sight of the novel's status as one literary form or principle among others. For a more complete presentation of the reception of GBS, see Ek 7-20.</page><page sequence="21">Gösta Berlings Saga 427 in the work, which lead her to conclude that one cannot "label [GBS] as belonging to any distinct genre'5(i7).21 Nonetheless, she does not re- frain from novelizing these generic contradictions as tensions between myth and reality or, more significantly, between reality and fantasy (18). Reality once again becomes defined in terms of novelistic realism. The difference between novelistic and epic-mythic traits is thus understood in terms of the subjectivity of the narrator. At times, Edström says, the narrator appears as a sober chronicler, at other times she employs a mythic "perspective.55 The latter (but not the former), she feels, calls for a symbolic interpretation "in psychological terms55 (19). In the end then, all conflicts and tensions of a representational and rhetorical nature are appropriated for a psychological reading in terms of ambigu- ities and conflicting perspectives within the narrator. The same psychologism informs the article by Lagerroth but more directly applied to Lagerlöf as historical person. Lagerroth prepares the way for his psychologism by a general anthropomorphism of narrative perspectives.22 He writes: "Samma händelse kan ses frân fiera olika perspektiv, âterges ur fiera olika berättares perspektiv55 (146) [One and the same event can be seen from several different points of view, de- scribed from the perspective of several different narrators]. With the seemingly innocent absence of a conjunctive link between the two clauses, he posits the right to read any conflicting textual description both ways; i.e., as different points of view within one and the same narrator or as the views of multiple narrators. The importance of the figure of the child-reader in GBS makes the distinction between child and adult one of the central psychological dichotomies through which the text seeks to harmonize different dis- cursive and explanatory principles. Lagerroth adopts the same strategy, which makes it difficult to determine when he is paraphrasing and when explicating the text: "Den stora skiljelinjen i boken [gar mellan] verkligheten sâdan den tedde sig for fbrfattarinnans 'moderna5 jag, dâ hon skrev boken [samt barnets] bild av de gamlas [berättelser]55 (147) 21 A similar view appears in Lagerroth's essay in the more categorical statement that GBS "är ingen roman" (123) [is no novel]. Both critics disqualify the category of novel without giving any definition of what a novel in fact is. 22 The naturalized anthropomorphization of narrative style as "narrative voice" becomes most obvious when critics describe pseudo-objective, naturalist techniques of narration, which do not use any narrator-figure. Instead of describing this as a narrator-less narration critics prefer to talk about it as a narration with a hidden or invisible narrator.</page><page sequence="22">428 Scandinavian Studies [The principal dividing line in the book (is that between) reality as perceived by the author's "modern" self, when writing the book (and the child's) image of old people's (tales)]. Later he places "barnets tro" [the belief of the child] in opposition to the scepticism of the adult narrator and concludes by stating: "Berätterskan har troligen sina sympatier eller intressen pa bada hall, hon kan uppträda som talesman for bade den ena sidan och den andrà" (147) [The narrator's sympathies or interests lie probably with both parties, she can serve as spokesman for both]. The child-adult dichotomy is a variation on the basic psychologist dichotomy of author-narrator.23 As such it is employed to harmonize tensions between GBS's epic-mythic principles of mimetic representa- tions and its novelistic diagesis in the form of the narrator's comments and reflections. By identifying the latter with the adult and the former with the child, the principal differences between the two are neutralized. One could speak here of a form of assimilative chiasmas: the am- biguous entity of author-narrator (or adult-child) is superimposed on other dichotomies in order to give them the feel of coherence. If this is done often in relation to tensions between textual mimesis and diagesis, one also often finds it applied to differences and tensions between writing and voice. Author thus comes to designate the representing subject of writing, and narrator the represented subject of vocal narra- tion, the textual effect of voice.24 But- and this is the crucial point and the difference between the form of psychologism in question here and psychoanalytic readings informed by a principally decentered sub- ject-the two are simultaneously identified as one and the same. The critic here adopts the novel's strategy of imploding contradictions and tensions between speech and writing, between oral and written story- telling into the hidden inferiority of the author as ultimate, all-encompassing entity. 23 A clear example of how the child-adult dichotomy is identified with the narrator- author dichotomy is when Lagerroth describes how the supernatural events depicted in the beginning of the chapter "Torkan" [The Drought] "ges auktoritet" [is authorized] by the narrator and "tycks godtas ocksâ av den upplysta författarinnan" (150) [seems to be accepted also by the enlightened author]. 24 Lagerroth talks about "författarinnans 'moderna' jag, da hon skrev boken" [the author's "modern self' by the time she wrote the book] and only uses the term narrator in conjunction with voice: the narrator is "talesman" [spokesman] ; something is "âtergivet ur berätterskans egen mun" [related by the narrators own mouth]; or "berätterskan for ordet" (147-9) [the narrator has the word].</page><page sequence="23">Gösta Berlings Saga 429 The Mirror Castle of Psychologism That literary texts have made use of psychologism as a strategy for homogenizing textual contradictions is one thing. That literary criti- cism has come to adopt it is quite another. Instead of trying to describe what a literary text says and, more importantly, what it tries to do, the critic hereby reduces his role to that of the loyal servant trying to enforce and verify the anthropomorphic operations in the text. "The discourse of the object . . . insidiously comes to occupy the place of discourse about the object55 (Metz 5). Let me end this discussion of GBS with a final example of how psychologism opens the possibility of an infinite equation of psycho- logical interiorities. In a psycho-biographical study of Lagerlöf, Birgitta Holm describes Marianne Sinclair, with her paralyzing self-scrutiny, as the "kvinnan i spegelkabinettet55 (100) [the woman in the mirrored boudoir], a Narcissus of conflicting self-images. Holm reads this char- acterization of Marianne as a fictional self-portrait.25 She quotes an unpublished passage from the manuscript of Lagerlöf 5s autobiogra- phy, "Dagbok for Selma Ottilia Lovisa Lagerlöf55 (1933) in which the seventy-five year old Lagerlöf recalls a daydream she had at age four- teen. In it, she figured as "en ung adelsfröken och jag heter Marianne Sinclair55 [a young aristocratic lady and my name is Marianne Sinclair]. Lagerlöf insists that "det är alldeles jag själv, som är Marianne Sinclair, for det är min själ som bor i henne55 (ioi) [it is definitely I myself who is Marianne Sinclair, because it is my soul that lives in her]. If Marianne Sinclair already existed as a fantasy-figure in the imagi- nation of the fourteen-year old Selma, the character Marianne Sinclair is, of course, only born within the context of GBS.26 If the object of 25 Holm writes: "Om nâgon vid sidan av Gösta Beding har äran av att ha 'skrivit5 romanen, sâ är det Marianne Sinclair" (ioo) [If anyone besides Gösta Berling may have the honor of having "written" the novel, it is Marianne Sinclair]. Holm's book is as a psycho-biographical reading of LagerlöPs authorship. In it, as in any psycho-biographi- cal reading, one can find numerous instances of psychologisms. Their function in this context is, however, somewhat different, since the basic perspective is psychoanalytic rather than psychological. 26 Marianne's character appears as a conglomerate of several literary as well as real-life models. She does not appear in any of the chapters that, according to Gullberg, were written before July 1890, when the narrator-persona was stabilized. This suggests that Marianne should be read not as an origin for, but rather as a secondary complement to the narrator, a mirror-image offered the reader as an external reflection of the narrator-</page><page sequence="24">43O Scandinavian Studies one's study is LagerlöPs life and authorship as a symbolic-dynamic process, as in Holm's study, then such parallels are of course highly relevant. If, on the other hand, the object of one's study is the text as a literary work, an overemphasis on the equation Marianne-Lagerlöf will eclipse what is more important for an understanding ofGBS, namely the mediating role of the narrator. A more recent book, Henrik Wivel's Snedronningen [The Snow Queen], has precisely this problem. The author picks up and develops Holm's equation in order to "nâ ned til den skjulte Selma Lagerlöf" [reach down to the hidden Selma Lagerlöf] (7). In the hidden depths of LagerlöPs interiority, Wivel discovers- to his Danish delight- the mythic figure of H.C. Andersen's Snow Queen, the solemn sovereign over an ice castle of frozen emotions. WivePs mythic baptizing of Lagerlöf as the Snow Queen rests on a rather vague resemblance be- tween the Snow Queen and Marianne Sinclair.27 The Snow Queen thus serves as a kind of matrix for the identification of Lagerlöf with Marianne, with the narrator as the mediating, eclipsed term. The interesting and problematic aspect of this all-encompassing analogical paradigm is that it defies any logical objection: it is precisely as a fictional or mythic construction that it claims to throw light on the eclipsed interiority of Lagerlöf and GBS. If this mirror castle of endlessly interchangeable imagines could be said to deconstruct the entities it seeks to describe, it is nonetheless precisely this imaginary abyss that makes of psychologism such a pow- erful device for engulfing and containing every form of heterogeneity. To paraphrase de Man's words about anthropomorphism in general: it is easy enough to cross the barrier between the narrative figure/function author's hidden interiority. For models of Marianne, see Wagner 1:132 and Hedin 40. Marianne's similarity to the Snow Queen is based primarily on her chilly, paralyzing self- observation, perhaps also on the fact that she on one occasion lies down to die in the snow only to be rescued by Gösta. The equation remains halting, since Andersen's Snow Queen personifies a misanthropic cynicism that is not to be found in Marianne. The forced analogy creates the suspicion that it has merely been evoked by LagerlöPs metaphoric description of Marianne's terrorizing super-ego as a spirit with "isögon" [eyes of ice]. 27 Marianne's similarity to the Snow Queen primarily consists in her chilly, paralyzing self-observation, or perhaps also in that she on one occassion lies down in the snow to die, only to be rescued by Gösta. The equation is tenuous, since Andersen's Snow Queen personifies a misanthropic cynacism that is not to be found in Marianne.

Once these functions have been anthro- pomorphized and turned into imaginary reflections of each other, their narrative and rhetorical function will appear merely as external, more or less coincidental roles or masks. PSYCHOLOGISM IN LITERATURE What, if any, tentative conclusions and generalizations could be drawn from this discussion and these examples of psychologism in literature and literary criticism? We might say that in literature, the notion of psychological interiority emerged and continues to reemerge as a re- sponse to a clash between heterogeneous systems of representation, which, for one reason or other, resist homogenization. Through psychologism, the very logic of representation is subjected to the logic of expression. Once this is done, textual elements can be transported from one logic to the other in any way which best serves the desire for homogeneity and meaning. It is no coincidence that literary psychologism first appeared in the novel, since the novel was and has remained the privileged form for the destruction of the literary (or rather poetic) genre. What Bakhtin called the novel's heteroglossia- its employment of different generic and so- cial discourses placed in decentered, dialogic relations- seems to have emerged in conjunction with the notion of psychological interiority. Without the support of psychologism and the teleological principle of expression, literary heteroglossia would have no raison tfêtre, nothing in which it could be anchored. Heteroglossia would appear as nothing but a blank mirror, a mechanical scramble of all the discursive bits and pieces that have happened to fall within its frame. (This, in fact, is precisely what happened when the surrealists subtracted the notion of author and psyche from the logic of modern literature and were left with the surrealist collage or montage.) Correspondingly, without a heteroglossia of non-synthesizable, representational principles and dis- courses, the notion of psychological interiority would never have become such an indispensable hermeneutic figure in (the reading of) literary texts.</page><page sequence="26">432 Scandinavian Studies That the entire logic of psychological interiority today has become unstable and uncertain does not mean that there is any simple way out. To use de Man's formulation once again and in a way he clearly did not intend, once the step from rhetoric to anthropomorphism has been taken, there can be no simple return to rhetoric. Once literary texts and the concept of literature have become anchored in psychological space (which is not yet completely true of GBS), the only way out of this eclipse is perhaps by a psycho-analytic decentering or deconstruction of the very notion of psychological interiority. The pragmatic conclusion to draw is that most of the literary texts we read in courses on literary history in different ways participate in the ongoing clash between older rhetorical systems of genre-writing and a modern principle of historicized and psychologized auteur-iitcraturc. In order to read and understand the different aspects of this fascinating battle of representational principles, we have to distance ourselves more firmly from the critical fallacy to universalize the representational principles, especially psychologism, of modern literature.
