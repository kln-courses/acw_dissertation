Joyce a very valuable theory in regard to the origin, evolution, and use of the Antillean stone collar, which, in the absence of other sound interpretations, should be seriously considered by both the student of religious evolution and of American archaeology. Most important of all is his hypothesis connecting these objects with tree worship.1 Thirty odd years before him others had perceived that these stones represented vegetal forms, but ratiocina- tion had, unfortunately, stopped there. Even so, the " collar" (an absurd mis- nomer which should be discarded) still undeservedly retains the reputation of being a veritable archoeological puzzle. Mr. Joyce says:- " It is not impossible that the hoop form may have been adopted in order to prevent the escape of the supernatural inmate, for the practice of enclosing a spirit in a circle is by no means uncommon in the rest of the world. The stone form would be adopted in order to provide a more precious and abiding habitation." Further on, he concludes that"' the carving on the decorated panels of the collars may depict the tree-spirit." In the present paper it will be shown that there are reasons for assuming that other spirits besides those of trees may be involved in the stone-collar cult and that, when these are represented, they are not, probably in a majority of cases, those of food plants. Readjusting Mr. Joyce's theory to the exigencies of our own line of inquiry, we may establish the following points in the interpretative chain: (a) Antillean spirit-worshippers had contrived to enclose certain tree-dwelling spirits within a more or less circular ring, originally made by fastening together the overlapping limbs of a tree-fork trimmed into unequal lengths. (b) Induced by certain reasons (which will be discussed later on), a piece of stone, carved in the shape of the archaic wooden fork, was substituted for that portion of the wooden collar. This piece of stone is generally 1 Journ. Roy. Anthrop.

By tying a slender branch to the two ends of this stone, the circle or oval would be completed. (c) It is obvious that in the course of time experience would teach the aborigine the great durability of the stone portion of the collar, and that he would soon resort to making the entire object of a, piece of stone. The preser- vation of the original vegetal forms, and of the textile patterns used in the bandages or ligatures which held together the limbs of a wooden collar, are a positive proof of this translation into stone. The purely fortuitous circumstances which must have surrounded the con- struction of the wooden collars presuppose a short duration for most individual specimens of these objects. Branches had to be cut unexpectedly as the apparition took place; unseasoned wood, which soon decays in the tropics, as well as certain kinds of soft, weak material, had to be employed at random. The question now arises: What particular form of worship was involved in the collar cult? Was it exclusively aimed at the worship of tree- and shrub-spirits? From the beginning an effort should be made to find the place of these objects in the history of religious evolution. Should they be considered as mere fetishes or as idols ? Goblet d'AlviellaL has defined a fetish as any material object supposed to have supernatural power; an idol, as a semblance (" simulacre ") conceived as conscious and animated, a fetish invested with the form of the spirit which it lodges. According to these excellent definitions, collars may be grouped in two separate classes-fetishes and idols, the former not having the sculptured life-forms which characterize the latter. After a comparative study of a large number of specimens, it is noticed that those of the slender type are almost invariably provided with the bifurcate feature, while this is, without any exception known to the present writer, absent in the specimens of the massive type. Life-forms occur, with perhaps a single exception (a specimen in the Museum of the American Indian, New York), in slender collars only. In endeavouring to correlate the stone collar with the animistic concepts then in vogue, and keeping in mind the well-known fact that Antillean worship of natural agencies was principally practised for certain material benefits expected, it should be our first care to identify in the collar and elbow-stones the vegetal forms which it is claimed they represent. Such forms, however, could hardly be derived from any of the herbaceous plants cultivated in the Haiti-Porto Rico culture area-maize, beans, sweet potatoes, 1 " L'animisme et sa place dans l'evolution relHgieuse," Paris, 1910.

The only possible exception is the yuca (manioc), a semi-shrubby plant which in fertile soil grows to a height of about 8 or 10 feet, developing stems occasionally comparable, in width, at least, to the ring of a slender collar. However, as the great number of nodes and scars which dot the stems of this plant in characteristic fashion are never represented in the fetish or idol, the attributed connection is improbable. Although certain authors1 have included among the number of cultivated plants large trees like the alligator-pear, the star-apple, the papaw, and the cacao, such assertion is subject to doubt. Oviedo lists the first two among the wild trees. Las Casas2 states that no fruit or other trees were cultivated in Haiti and the other islands, except the " arbol de las manzanillas," with the seeds of which the natives purged themselves. As may be inferred from the above data, there is little hope of ever associating the stone-collar cult with native agriculture and its affiliated religious concepts. We must now turn our attention to the insular forest and see what was the relation of pre-Columbian life to the wild flora of the islands. Fortunately both Las Casas and Oviedo have left us intensely interesting descriptions of Antillean wild trees and their uses. The following extract will assist the reader in forming an opinion as to the importance of the wild flora in aboriginal life:- Wild trees from the Greater Antilles. Aboriginal uses.

For house-building, making " maca- nas " (war clubs), and a score of other uses. If we add to this very incomplete list the several species of wild trees whose fruits were eaten by the Antilleans, and if we recall that wood was the only fuel used, we must conclude that native life and culture depended to as great an extent on the forest as on any of the other two great sources of aboriginal life: the cultivated fields, and the fishing-grounds of river and ocean. The forest jungle was to the islander at once his arsenal and shipyard; his store of provisions during times of scarcity, and his perennial store of household utensils; his medicine-chest and vanity-box. War, religion, social organization, government, domestic economy, public health, and art-all were directly or indirectly related to the forest. But there is yet a much more significant fact in connection with the general trend of the present interpretation of the stone collar; according to a tradition, the souls of the dead departed to an earthly paradise (in Haiti) where they continued to live on a splendid grove of mammee trees, according to one author, of guanabanas; according to another, subsisting on their fruits.2 It may, therefore, be assumed that the native's mental subordination to animistic criteria must have led him, under these circumstances, to the formation of a complex of beliefs, of which the central principle was the existence of bush, tree and human disembodied spirits, conceived of as conscious and animated beings. As every property possessed by bark, pith, sap, leaf, or flower, which was capable of human utilization was invested with the attributes of animated nature, we may imagine the profusion of deities and spirits with which these tribes peopled the world. The pantheon, if such it may be called, was ample enough to contain every imaginable divinity-essence, supernatural power, zemi, soul-of things material and immaterial. Returning to the subject of the morphology of the stones, we may repeat that the dimensions of the majority, especially those of the massive type, evidently show 1 See L. S. Murphy, " Forests of Porto Rico," U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bulletin No. 354. 2 Pane, as quoted by Roth, Aborigine8 of Hfispaniola, p. 264.</page><page sequence="5">SQre Suggestions of Interpretative Value. 139 that a large, heavy, and stout tree branch is symbolized. Large wild trees are the subject of the cult. Therefore it appears very improbable that it is in any way connected with agricultural practices underlying native concepts of germination, growth, propagation, and fertility; for in the case of wild species of trees these phenomena were utterly beyond the control of human agencies. It has been shown elsewhere that the promotion of these functions was imaginarily ascribed to the three-pointed idols.' The fact that the feature of stone collars which best preserves the unmistakable vegetal form of the wooden archetype-the fork (the boss and panels of Fewkes' description)-justifies a discussion of why the branch of a tree was cut immediately below the fork. Two explanations may be tentatively offered. According to the writer's investigations among the primitive-minded woodmen and mountaineers of San Domingo and Porto Rico, whose folk-lore so notably abounds in survivals of Indian tradition, the uncanny noises sometimes heard or supposed to be heard proceeding from vegetation, especially in solitary places, are generally believed to be caused by one or two branches, and not by a rustle of the entire foliage of a tree. This is what the Porto Rican idiom " ramajeo " (from " rama," a branch) implies. A puff of wind, often unperceived at the lower levels of the atmosphere, may strike a single spot in the foliage of a tree. Such a current of air may have been deflected by neighbouring tree-trunks, or, in a vertical plane, by other large natural obstacles. Among the ignorant especially, the psychological effect of these momentary phenomena is singularly alarming, the more so if they contrast with the awe-inspiring stillness of a deep tropical forest. If we suppose that a single branch was believed by an Indian to be shaken by a spirit, it is certain that in attempting to confine it the branch would be cut off just below a fork-the point of union of two or more branches-in order to prevent its escape by one of the subsidiary branches. That this is not an idle conjecture is proved by the fact that several passages in the early chronicles inform us that in Haiti idols (zemi) were often treated as if they were mischievous beings, capable of outwitting men, and inclined to play tricks on their worshippers. There are one or two instances where idols, according to tradition, actually succeeded in evading their devotees.2 The other explanation refers to certain physical qualities of wood. A single straight branch could not be bent into a hoop-form if it did not possess the required flexibility. Very flexible branches would make rounder collars, while the more rigid sorts would produce oval or elliptical forms. These variations are faithfully recorded in the several specimens recovered. The difficulty would easily be overcome by using the limbs of a bifurcate branch. Now, as to the question of whether there is historical proof to support the opinion that the Antilleans believed that a spirit could enter a tree, and dwell there - 1 A. de Hostos, "1 Three-Pointed Stone Zemi or Idols from the West Indies: An Inter- pretation," American Anthropologist, vol. xxv, No. 1, pp. 56-72. 2 Fewkes, Aborigines of Porto Rico</page><page sequence="6">140 ADOLFO DE HOSTOS.-Antillean Stone Collars: a proof which it is necessary to submit here, as it is the basis of the several suggestions advanced in this paper-it will suffice to quote the following account by Fray Ramon Pane, an eye-witness and a sober recorder of the facts: " When a native was passing by a tree which was moved more than others by the wind, the Indian in fear calls out, 'Who are you ? ' The tree responds, 'Call here a Bohii or priest and I will tell you who I am.' When the priest or sorcerer had come to the tree and seated hiimself before it he performed certain prescribed ceremonies, and, rising, recounted the titles and honors of the principal chiefs of the island, and asked of the tree, 'What are you doing here? What do you wish of me? Why have you asked to have me called? Tell me if you wish me to cut you down, and, if you wish to go with me, how I shall carry you, whether I shall make you a house and plantation, and perform ceremonies for a year.' The tree answered these questions, and the man cut it down and made of it a statue or idol of sinister look . "1 The introductory words of this account are self-explanatory; the native's fear was aroused by a tree which was moved more than the others by the wind. It has been the author's good fortune personally to observe in Porto Rico and San Domingo several cases of survival of this belief. For instance, during the month of May, 1920, while on a visit to.the Luquillo mountains, a labourer named Candido Medina told him the following story: " One day, just after sunset, I was going home, when in passing by a big 'mango' tree I heard a noise, as if its branches were suddenly shaken by someone hidden there. I tried to run away, but I couldn't. I was too much afraid. I knew that the spirit of Don Carlos had been heard there before In Ramon Pane's account, the Indian too was actuated by fear. The noise was interpreted as caused by a supernatural agency, a spirit, of course, and having once revealed itself to mortal man, the Indian thought that it was a matter of the utmost importance for him to keep it, by shutting it in a piece of wood cut from the tree. The offer of a house and plantation was simply a propitiatory act. The spirit's interlocutor, after finishing the dialogue, cut the tree down and made of it " a statue of sinister look." This passage merits close scrutiny. The first question propounded by the startled passer-by was: " Who are you ? " The initial question made by the priest was: " What are you doing here ? " Both queries and the priest's recital of the titles of the chiefs of the island clearly imply ignorance as to the spirit's identity, and that it was not instantly recognized as the spirit of the particular object where its presence had been revealed. As in the case of the modern survival recorded above, it was supposed to be foreign to the object which lodged it, and was thought I Pane's account in Churchill's Collection of Voyages, vol. ii, p. 628.</page><page sequence="7">Some Suggestions of Interpretative Value. 141 to be accidentally dwelling in it. Hence, it might have been interpreted as the soul of any other object, phenomenon or being-human or animal. The fact that the identification of these spirits was the privilege and task of the priest-and that in so doing the shrewd medicine-man might often have grasped the opportunity of promoting his own personal interests-indicates that the range of his powers of identification must have been very wide indeed. The episode narrated by Pane is, furthermore, a description of animistic revela- tion. Observe that the spirit's presence was spontaneously revealed to an un- suspecting individual. After all, it must have been a very disagreeable incident in the traveller's day. We have seen elsewhere that when a food-plant spirit was worshipped its identity had been determined by the sorcerer through close observation of germination phenomena. In other words, revelation of the plant spirit had been diligently sought for by the priest in its supposed practical endeavour of promoting plant fertility by supernatural means. The underlying concepts are quite different in Pane's narrative. If we take into consideration the fact that it is a record of the status of animistic philosophy after the discovery-when religion had already attained the level of idolatry-we are in a position correctly to assume that in the antecedent (possibly partially co-existing) stage of fetishism, the revealed spirit, after the ceremony of cutting down the tree, would have been kept in a part of its trunk or branches, and it would have been believed that it continued to dwell there, even though its semblance had not been carved or painted upon the fetish. But why, it will be asked, has the idea of a hoop-like fetish only occurred to the ancient Antillean ? We may imagine that during the fetishistic stage the native's material dependence on the forest was closer and the conditions of life more precarious than in the subsequent stage of idolatry and agriculture. The need of recurring to the capture of sylvan spirits must have been frequent and pressing. The quickest way of achieving this purpose would be by resorting to the expedient of enclosing the spirit within a ring made of the object showing signs of being spirit- possessed. At any rate, there are indications that the collar-stone cult should be regarded as corresponding to the pre-agricultural stage of West Indian culture. There is, indeed, indirect historical evidence to the eflect that it had disappeared at the time of the arrival of the whites. To the writer's knowledge the collars are mentioned but once in contemporary literature, in an inventory of the effects found in the possession of a cacique. Pane never mentioned them, although other enigmatical objects, the three-pointed stones, which are believed to correspond to the agricultural stage, were seen and vaguely investigated and described by him. It is extremely improbable that such a striking object as the stone collar would have escaped the attention of the con- querors. On the other hand, the number of these objects which has been recovered to the present day is so small in proportion to the total number of Antillean relics</page><page sequence="8">142 ADOLFO DE HosTOs.-Antillean Stone Collars. collected,l and the amount of labour involved in their manufacture is so enormous that one naturally concludes that they were rare and highly prized objects. Therefore, a reason which may account for their absence from the historical records is that the cult had become obsolete at the time of the discovery. It is very significant that these idols have generally been found in caves, in isolated places where other evidences of aboriginal life were not apparent, and occasionally in the bottom of creeks and rivers, but not in village sites, shell-heaps and burial-grounds of the Taino culture. This does not mean, however, that the author would even suggest that the Taino were ignorant of the existence and significance of these objects. On the contrary, as survivals of a previous cultural stage of their own people, they may have been adapted to certain rituals and ceremonies more or less connected with the ideas and concepts originally involved in the discarded cult. The fact that the designs carved on the collars are characteristically Tainan does not mean that they were contemporary with the latest religious practices observed on the islands by the Europeans during the last decade of the fifteenth century. In concluding, a few words must be said to note that the life-forms carved on the collars and elbow-stones are almost invariably anthropomorphic, a fact 'which seems to corroborate the inference that these objects may have represented, in addition to shrub, tree, forest, and human spirits, the anthropomorphized spirits of certain forest products which had a profound importance in the development of the social, military, and religious institutions of the Arawak tribes of Haiti and Porto Rico. 1 About seventy specimens may be added to the one hundred specimens known to have been recorded by Dr. Fewkes twenty years ago.</page></plain_text>
