<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAWRENCE DURRELL AND ALEXANDRIA By JOAN GOULIANOS BEST known for his "Alexandria Quartet," Lawrence Durrell sometimes is regarded as a spokesman for the Egyptian city. Such a view of Durrell probably an gers some Egyptians, disappoints some tourists, and amuses Durrell. For, judging by his "Quartet" and by his other writings about Alexandria, Durrell had little affection for Alexandria or for the rest of Egypt. "But I loathed Egypt 1" Durrell writes to Henry Miller in 1958. " (Not a word.) " Durrell seems to have disliked Egypt partly because he came to it, against his will, from Greece. His view of Egypt often seems to include an implicit contrast with Greece. For Durrell, Greece is productivity; Egypt is sterility. Greece is marriage ; Egypt, divorce and loneliness. Greece is a chosen homeland ; Egypt, a place of refuge. From 1935 to 1941, Durrell, in Greece, spent what seem to have been some of the happiest years of his life. Particu larly the years 1935-39, spent on the island of Corfu, at least as Durrell portrays them, were idyllic and productive. They were the years when Durrell first heard the sound of his own voice as a writer. They were the years when he seem ingly was happily married to his first wife, Nancy. The stay on Corfu was the time when Durrell, in his poetry, develops an image for the self, the image of a man in mystic union with a Greek island. For Durrell, who had come to Corfu to es cape England, the island seems to have been what he needed. "Our unregretted home," he calls it in "Prospero's Cell," his reminiscence of his island stay. But events out of his control were to separate him from this "home." The Nazi invasion of Greece sent Durrell and his wife to the mainland. Finally, in 1941, as the Germans advanced, Durrell, his wife, and child</page><page sequence="2">DURRELL AND ALEXANDRIA 665 fled to Egypt. From 1941 to 1944, Durrell was in Cairo as Foreign Press Officer. From 1944 to 1945, he was Press Attaché in Alexandria. Free of Nazi bondage but cut off from European culture and publication, Durrell, with other writer-exiles, was Egypt's prisoner. In defense, he and two other writers, Rob bin Fedden and Bernard Spencer, set up their own literary magazine, their Personal Landscape. Fedden, in an intro duction to an anthology of the magazine, dissects the exile in Egypt and its effects. The writers in Personal Landscape, he says, were joined not by common outlook or policy but by their exile. "Though headed in different directions and start ing from very different points, these poetic bodies . . . have been moving through the same strange and negative medium and have inevitably acquired something of the exile-mind." Fedden limits the meaning of "exile" not to its tragedy but to its stagnation, a stagnation that "always threatens when an individual is isolated for any length of time in an alien context which he does not understand and in which circum stances alone have placed him." Prolonged involuntary exile in Egypt, Fedden explains, is bitter for the European. He lacks definite changes of season. He faces flat and unarticulated landscape. He walks upon an earth of "bone mould and excrement." A Christian in a Moslem world, he doesn't "even know the shape and outline of things ... he cannot hope to find his own life and his own effort seconded and strengthened by unconscious community with, and participation in, the fife and effect of the people around him." An outsider to the "great blind stream of Islam," he can partake only in the life of the Europeanized (Levantine) upper classes of Cairo and Alex andria—a life of "nightmarish unreality." Writing vivid descriptions of Egypt to Miller, in the spring of 1944, Durrell echoes Fedden's feelings: No I don't think you would like it. First this steaming humid flatness—not a hill or mound anywhere—choked to bursting</page><page sequence="3">666 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW point with bones and the crummy deposits of wiped out cul tures. Then this smashed up broken down shabby Neapolitan town, with its Levantine mounds of houses peeling in the sun. A sea flat, dirty brown and waveless rubbing the port. ... A saturated middle European boredom. ... NO SUB JECT OF CONVERSATION EXCEPT MONEY. Durrell found the intense Egyptian atmosphere of sex and death compelling, but he also found it hollow and destruc tive. The Alexandrian women were "sexual provender of quality but the atmosphere is damp, hysterical, sandy, with wind off the desert fanning everything to mania." "Les femmes, commes les peintres d'Alexandrie ont trop de tech nique mais peu de tempérament." In his poem, "Levant," Durrell sums up the qualities of Levantine life. Using the same structure he used for an earlier poem about Greece, "In Arcadia," he implicitly con trasts the Egyptian culture with the Greek. Whereas re ligion, "divination," created Arcadia, commerce, "gum, oats and syrup," created the Levant. The Arcadians "taught / the rock to flow with odourless water. / Fire and a brute art came among them." The Levantines talked "of bales, / Lad ing and enterprises," "invented credit," left bastards. The Arcadians developed small skills—flutes, women "who sing ing . . . civilized their children with the kiss." The Levan tines turned to "boys, women, and drugs ... grammarians / who fed upon the fathers fat with cash," Turned oats and syrup here To ribbons and wands and rash Patents for sex and feathers, Sweets for festivals and deaths. In Arcadia, "something died out by this river: but it seems / Less than a nightingale ago." But in the Levant, "nothing changes ... the human type 'Levant' " is fixed—"something money or promises can buy." One of many "shiftless refugees . . . living in furnished</page><page sequence="4">DURRELL AND ALEXANDRIA 667 rooms," Durrell anguished over the strangling effect of Egypt upon his work. "In this soft corrupting plenty noth ing very much is possible.... If one wrote poems here they could only be like marrows, or pumpkins—or like the huge pulpy Egyptian moon which rises like a sore every now and then on this fleshy sky." "If one could write a single line of anything that had a human smell to it here, one would be a genius." A near-genius at least, Durrell wrote to save himself from Egyptian apathy. He felt that "Prospero's Cell" was "poor stuff but I feel I must keep the machine running or I'll die." He "knocked off" "The Dark Labyrinth" in a month "in order to hold my depression at bay." Both about the Greek landscape, the two books tidy up time past. Time present, the stay in Egypt, was subject matter for what seems for Durrell a more immediate mode of expression— poetry. Writing to Miller in the spring of 1945, Durrell announces enthusiastically, "I have some new poems, really good this time, called Cities, Plains, and People." Like Durrell's book of poetry about his 1935-41 stay in Greece, "A Private Country," "Cities, Plains, and People" is dominated by landscape poems. Some are about Greece; others are about Egypt, particularly Alexandria. Still others portray both landscapes. Whereas the title, "A Private Country," suggests a single personalized place, the title of the second volume suggests diverse impersonal places. No longer possessed by and possessing his island, Durrell became a refugee. Seemingly reflecting his own journey, "In Europe," a recitative included in "Cities, Plains, and Peo ple," describes the effects of wandering. The characters, a man, a woman, and an old man, moving from place to place, "are getting the refugee habit." They are becoming "only anonymous feet moving, / Without friends anymore, with out books." Their "address is the world." "The present is an eternal journey." Without houses or context, they are "the dispossessed ... No time for love, no room for love." Only</page><page sequence="5">668 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW the old man carries the past in him "like a precious vessel, re membering / Its essence, ownership and ordinary loving." Deprived of these, "beyond tears at last," the characters look forward only to death. Though the play is about European refugees, it particularly emphasizes the loss of Greece. Dedi cated, in "Cities, Plains, and People" to Elie, probably Elie Papadimitriou, Greek poetess in exile in Egypt, the recita tive ends with a lament for Greece: old man: Frontiers mean nothing any more. Dear Greece! man: Yes. We can die now. In Durrell's vocabulary, "critic" is a dirty word. Clea smacks Darley "full across the mouth" when he tells her he is "meditating a book of criticism." "Artist" is an ambiguous word. "There seem to be two types of creative man," Dur rell writes in a study of Miller. "The first controls his ma terial and shapes it. The second delivers himself over, bound hand and foot to his gifts." The work of the first is "the pa tient and prescient interest of an artist in a form determined, in a tract of experience digested and finished with." The work of the second is "the spiritual athletic of the mystic." Durrell's goal, in the works he wrote during his 1935-41 stay, was to be this second type of creative man, one who grows by his work, one "reborn with every breath one draws and every line one writes." But removal from the landscape of his heart's desire seems to have stunted this growth. In the poems about Egypt, the narrator is a critic and an artist seemingly of the first, the worst type. Prisoner of an oppres sive landscape, the narrator is unable to be truly creative as an artist or as a man. Instead, he arranges, he classifies, and he complains. Longing for escape to a Greek island, he paces the boundary of his prison—the Alexandrian harbor. When he is not prowling the harbor, he sits, unable to write any thing except letters, in his furnished room overlooking the</page><page sequence="6">DURRELL AND ALEXANDRIA 669 city. The dominant elements of his landscape are the wind, which fans in him disturbing thoughts of Greece, and the sea, his severed link of escape, which reflects his own frustration. Though animate, his Alexandrian landscape is an irritant, not a possessor. Though anthropomorphic, it mirrors not the body of a god but types of prisoners like the narrator him self—the restless conscript, the blinded Samson, the walker in the darkness. "Alexandria, like / The wife of Lot—a metaphor for tears." The poem most clearly displaying the city and the narra tor's relation to it is "Alexandria." Beginning the poem, the narrator wishes To the lucky now who have lovers or friends, Promontories splashed by the salty sea, Groaned on in darkness by the tram To horizons of love or good luck or more love—• Apparently unlucky and unloved himself, he now moves "through many negatives to what I am." The negatives he moves through are Alexandria. The sea "restless as a conscript" is the opposite of the Greek sea. "The last pale / Lighthouse," "a Samson blinded," with "its huge charred orbit," is the antithesis of one of Durrell's main images for Greece, the recording Eye. The Alexandrian wind is "condemned by Greece." The Alexandrian promon tories of darkness, of groaning trams to endless love and luck contrast the Greek promontory of light and repose. Locked inside his "poky hot / Tenth floor room," the narrator is the antithesis of the man in union with the island. Whereas the man on the island was a mystic, the man in the furnished room is "the critic and the lover," "the queer student" who "shuts his books," "the artist at his papers" who is disturbed by the wind. Apparently unable to create, he organizes (he revises "the index of our lovers and our friends"), he studies and loves ("All indeed whom war or</page><page sequence="7">670 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW time threw up / On this littoral... / Were objects"), and he learns acceptance, "to suffer and not condemn." First published in 1946, the year after Durrell left Egypt, "Alexandria" may have been written when Durrell was ready to leave the city. It is the only Egyptian poem in which the narrator, like the narrator of the "Quartet," so compassionately reminisces about his fellow Alexandrians. Indeed the few details the poem's narrator gives about them suggest "Quartet" characters. "B. with his respect for the Object" seems a predecessor of Balthazar with his respect for objectivity. "The dented boy's lip" later marks Narouz. "D. / Searching in sex like a great pantry for jars" suggests Darley. "Conon in Alexandria," first published in 1945, a less compassionate and more anguished poem, corresponds more closely to Durrell's descriptions of himself in the letters. The name, Conon, Durrell has admitted, refers "to an imaginary Greek philosopher who visited me twice in my dreams.... He is one of my masks." The poem begins with a description of Conon's city, perhaps of Conon himself: "Ash-heap of four cultures, / Bounded by Mareotis, a salt lake." Like the narrator of "Alexandria," Conon is a prisoner. "I have been four years bound here : / A time for sentences by the tripod." He writes "those interminable whining letters, / On the long beaches." Or, he passes his day, "not writing, alone in my window." He is "a solitary presumed quite happy," a pre sumption he indicates is illusory. "I say 'presumed', but would not have it otherwise." In fact, his four years have been a time of typically Alexandrian torment: "Prophecies by those who were born dead, / Or who lost their character but kept their taste." The expressions of a man so lonely he engages in endless imaginary conversations, Conon's small speeches are frag mentary, cryptic, nearly schizophrenic. Sometimes he de scribes; sometimes he addresses a mysterious "you." At one point, he addresses "my friends." At another, he imagines</page><page sequence="8">DURIIELL AND ALEXANDRIA 671 the possibility of the you describing a historian commenting upon the critic in him (Conon). Composed of sections di vided by asterisks, and studded with italicized aphorisms, the poem is like a miniature "Quartet" floating free of its charac ters. Without separate characters to anchor them, the apho risms and descriptions become the expressions of a frag mented self. "There are sides of the self One can seldom show. They live on and on In an emergency of anguish always Waiting for parents in another." Conon's anguish seems founded upon a parting. He refers to "a love, Fragmented everywhere by conscience and deceit, / Ending on this coast of torn-out lighthouses." He is ob sessed with the desire to escape from Alexandria to a Greek island. Memories of Greece haunt him: ... O my friends, Surely these nightly visitations Of islands in one's sleep must soon be over? You would think that thoughts so long rehearsed Like the dry friction of ropes in the mind Would cease to lead me where in Greece The almond-candles and the statues burn. But still an Alexandrian, he can only taste "the island wind / Blown against wet lips and shutters out of Rhodes." For Conon, Greece is, in a dark world, an inextinguishable candle. Conon's obsession to return reflects his connection of Greece with healing and of Alexandria with wounding. In a less condensed, seemingly earlier version of "Conon in Alex andria," love is connected explicitly with Greece: Once here sounded by the sands The hairy music of reeds before our Pan Died in us, and before our Greek Love sickened and turned to politics.</page><page sequence="9">672 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW Durrell had—as Count D says about the narrator of "Prospero's Cell"—"the best of [his] youth in the island." His woman, his island, his tree, the sun, the sea, and the promontory had provided him with the soil in which a new seer self could grow. But in Egypt, this self seems to have shattered. Losing his island, Durrell also lost his woman. He and his wife, Nancy, the woman who had shared his island life, split up. In a letter to Miller in 1943, Durrell mentions the break and suggests a cause was the war and the refugee life: "We have split up; just the war I guess. After Greece, Crete and the Alamein evacuation we got to understand what the word 'refugee' means." In general, Durrell kept private the reasons for the break. To Alfred Perles, his friend, "he alluded [to it] only in retrospect and then only in vague terms." Deprived of his wife and daughter, Durrell, "an eternal-husband" type, according to Perles, must have suffered from living alone. Though Durrell kept his troubles private, it was evident to Perles that his friend "was going through great emotional stress." The cryptic references to parting, to loneliness, and to the pull of habit, in "Alexan dria" and "Conon in Alexandria," evidence this stress. To Durrell, a believer in the influence of landscape, Egypt was a chief conspirator in the plot against his Greek joy. In the poems about Alexandria, the broken lonely uncreative self seems a product of imprisonment in the Levantine city. In "Justine," Darley lays the blame for behavior in Alexan dria squarely upon the city: "the city which used us as its flora—precipitated in us conflicts which were hers and which we mistook for our own. ... I see at last that none of us is properly to be judged for what happened in the past. It is the city which should be judged though we, its children, must pay the price." So disorienting is Alexandria that it is only after Darley has returned to his island that he can compre hend fully the Alexandrians and their city "as one and the same phenomenon." Paradoxically, the city that gave Durrell so much material</page><page sequence="10">DURRELL AND ALEXANDRIA 673 seems to have rendered him impotent to use it. To deliver his material, he had to deliver himself from the city. He sought to return to the island where once before he had been creative. In 1944, Durrell writes to Miller: "I am writ ten down for Greece. I terribly need to recover my sanity a bit—disoriented and bruised.... I did not know before what Gaul meant to the exiled Roman poet or Siberia to the Rus sian. Now I know. Your heart shrivels in its case for lack of moisture." "I think if I could get to some Greek island and live in real poverty with someone like her, [the dark-eyed woman, possibly, Eve] I could work like a fiend." In 1945, Durrell succeeded in getting to an island : he was sent to Rhodes. "Can't tell you what a feeling of cloud lifting to get out of Egypt," he writes Miller. But Durrell was not "out" of Egypt yet. Later, focusing on Alexandria, he would turn the pain of his Egyptian stay into the literature of the "Quartet." Perhaps Durrell, like Darley, eventually breaks the city's deadly spell by recreating it. "I feel it [Alexandria] fade inside me, in my thoughts," writes Dar ley to Clea at the end of the "Quartet."</page></plain_text>
