      <p>We are grateful for the comments of Sutliff and of Hayden and the issues they raised, and we respond here to the two authors in turn, starting with Donna Sutliff. There seems to be little evidence at present that the sky itself played a major role in the symbolism of the Neolithic of Turkey and the Middle East. Certainly, the examples we gave of water birds and vultures taking human flesh and perhaps heads from corpses could be thought to imply an upward, skyward movement, but the focus seems to be on birds themselves, with humans dressing up as vultures in the paintings at Çatalhöyük or transforming into them at Göbekli. We see little evidence at Çatalhöyük for the three-tiered cosmology claimed by Lewis-Williams and Pearce (2005). Triangles in the art may have signified the sun and horns the moon, but no evidence for such associations in the symbolism has been recovered from the site so far.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, orientation is undoubtedly a key component at many sites. For Çatalhöyük, Wason (2010) has gathered together all of the evidence indicating a concern with cardinal directions. In particular, the highly repetitive way in which most buildings are oriented on a north-south axis has long been recognized (Mellaart 1967), with adult burial more common in the northern parts of houses. There are also differences in the symbolism found on east and west walls in the main rooms in buildings.</p>
      <p>We have closely examined more than 2,000 figurines from the site and have demonstrated that not only do zoomorphic figures predominate but within the anthropomorphic assemblage, nongendered examples far exceed all other kinds, whether male, female, or hybrid (Meskell et al. 2008). From that and more recent work at the site, it is clear that less than 3% of our entire corpus of figurines could be considered female (Nakamura and Meskell 2009:206). As recent analysis shows, many of the corpulent examples often assumed to be “female” show no primary sexual characteristics. That fact in itself reveals a choice made by Neolithic figurine makers that should not be ignored.</p>
      <p>We agree with Brian Hayden that cross-cutting sodalities were an important component of social life at Çatalhöyük. There is the history-house system, based on the passing down of human body parts and the construction of histories involving events associated with wild animals. But the networks set up by this system, for example, involving all of those houses that buried their dead in a particular history house, were not necessarily central to a myriad of other networks that have been observed in recent work at Çatalhöyük. For example, there were the networks of people sharing the same refuse or midden areas, and there were groupings of houses along terraces and along radial divisions of the settlement. There were networks of houses provisioned by specialist bead producers and stone figurine carvers. Houses were connected by the use of distinctive symbols and motifs used in paintings on walls. None of these networks seem to coincide significantly with others; rather, there were complex overlapping sets of network relations, which created a highly resilient social and economic fabric.</p>
      <p>There were networks of houses linked by distinctive uses of pairs of relief leopards or connected by the use of “splayed figures” probably representing bears. It seems possible that at Çatalhöyük, something akin to “secret societies” could have used powerful symbols “to reinforce their projected image of supernatural power,” as argued by Hayden. In recent work at Çatalhöyük as part of a Templeton Foundation project, Barbara Mills (personal communication) compared the use of the symbolism at that site with pueblos in the American Southwest, where cross-cutting sodalities are created by participation in medicine societies in which there is a special relationship to wild animals. These animals may be painted on the walls of domestic houses when the houses are used for ceremonial events. Medicine or hunting societies may have been one among several mechanisms by which houses at Çatalhöyük participated in networks of relations.</p>
      <p>An area in which the evidence suggests a different view from that proposed by Hayden, however, concerns competitive feasting and the scale of communal action. Hayden describes aggrandizing behavior that establishes sociopolitical control. While it seems likely that certain groups at Çatalhöyük established some degree of ceremonial standing through the manipulation of rituals, the evidence for any marked degree of social distinction is very slight. There are a number of difficulties associated with a focus on feasting and aggrandizement.</p>
      <p>First, it is possible that the bucrania in houses were related to competitive feasting, but clear evidence for this remains elusive. Certainly, the paintings suggest that the bucrania could have memorialized the teasing, baiting, and killing of wild animals. It seems a likely conclusion that such events would be followed by some form of feasting. However, the deposits of bone on site that most likely represent discard from feasts are not extremely large (in contrast to the vast accumulation of bone at Musular, outside Aşıklı Höyük; Özbasaran 2011). In addition, they are not especially associated with elaborate or history houses or with any other evidence of social status or political control. The plastered bull heads found in houses have complex associations and functions, sometimes clearly linked to human burial.</p>
      <p>Second, whatever the role played by feasting, there is little evidence that houses at Çatalhöyük that were prominent in burial and ritual symbolism managed to convert spiritual power into sociopolitical control of resources and wealth. Displays of accumulation or wealth were rare at Çatalhöyük. Where accumulation did occur, for example, in the hoarding of obsidian or the storing of grain, there was an associated process of hiding or making less visible. Thus, the obsidian hoards were cached beneath the floors, and the bins and side-rooms that were used for storage were not decorated or symbolically marked in ways found in other areas of the house. There seems to have been a reticence to display wealth.</p>
      <p>Hayden suggests that hierarchical organizations existed at sites like Göbekli and Jerf el Ahmar and that elites would have controlled storage and resources. In our view, there is little evidence that any communal buildings in the Neolithic of the Middle East were associated with restricted control of storage and resources (as opposed to communal use). But at Çatalhöyük there is certainly now a large amount of evidence that shows that history houses, while preferentially controlling the dead, histories, and ritual paraphernalia, did not control storage or other resources. After examining large amounts of data collected in recent excavations, no correlations can be found between elaborate houses or history houses and storage bin size, side-room space, house size, richness of burials beneath the floors, numbers of figurines, or health indicators of those buried beneath house floors.</p>
      <p>As such, any argument that feasts at Çatalhöyük constituted one of the most important arenas for competition between the major social and political groups must confront with the evidence on several fronts. A third problem concerns the assumption made by Hayden that there was a kinship basis for the groups associated with houses at Çatalhöyük. Recent work by Pilloud and Larsen (2011) has shown that individuals buried in a building were not more biologically related than individuals in the society as a whole. It seems that those buried in a house should not be thought of in terms of lineal descent on the basis of biological kin but rather in terms of different forms of relatedness, including fictive, fostered, and affinal links. Once again, it appears that the society was composed of numerous cross-cutting relations, in which burial and cohabitation played their parts.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the question of intentionality in the domestication process. Hayden prefers an account in which competitive feasting led to the intention to domesticate in order to provide adequate resources. There simply is no evidence yet for this at Çatalhöyük. We now know that domestic cattle were introduced in the upper levels at the site, and before this, wild cattle, especially bulls, were involved in feasting. However, there is no evidence that wild bulls were “hunted out,” leading to the adoption of cattle domesticates. Indeed, after the adoption of domestic cattle, the use of wild cattle continued (Russell, Martin, and Buitenhuis 2005; Twiss and Russell 2009). There were many social, economic, and ritual changes in the upper levels at Çatalhöyük. The system of history houses and (medicine, hunting, secret) societies was invested in keeping the wild wild. As the system broke down (intentionally or not), domestic cattle were adopted within different social and ritual practices.</p>
