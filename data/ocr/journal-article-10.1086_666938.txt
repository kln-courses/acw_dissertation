Alan Millard   The University of Liverpool Victorian Culture and Classical Antiquity: Art, Opera, Fiction, and the Proclamation  of Modernity. By siMon Goldhill. Princeton, n.J.: Princeton University Press,  2011. Pp. [viii] + 352. Based on the martin lectures for 2010, simon Goldhill’s book has evolved from  four lectures to seven chapters, a substantial volume with a lengthy title that the author  in his introduction calls first “dull” and then “vast and clumsy.” The book’s form, a  set of case studies, follows a pattern found both in other martin lectures and in some  of G.’s earlier books. The chapters investigate novels, paintings, and operas in some  depth, while pursuing larger concerns discussed in a long introduction that aims to  hold the book together. G. begins by sketching what he calls the standard account of the role of classics in  Victorian Britain, a story of embedded cultural authority and conservatism in nation  and empire. he then identifies three areas in which classics played a role in radical  rejections of conservatism: romantic philhellenism, sexuality, and democracy. These  are, however, then sidelined as themselves parts of a standard account, albeit one of  radicalism, as G. identifies what he claims was a more profound challenge to the exist- ing sociocultural order: the growth of a historical sense and its erosion of theological  certainties. he suggests that the interface of classics and Anglicanism provides a useful  site for the exploration of the development of classics as a discipline, one that might  show how “the discipline appears sometimes to move in complete separation from  work outside the discipline, but sometimes acts in opposition to it, in an attempt to  control it, in earnest or angry or anxious response to it” (p. 9). he goes on to justify  his lengthy title on two grounds: first, the center of gravity of his chapters lies in the  late nineteenth century, and second, he is interested in the role of forgetting in the con- struction of a past—the forgetting of earlier events is a prerequisite for them to have  an impact when they are replayed later on. G. moves on to situate his book within the  field of reception studies, emphasizing the importance of investigating the evolution  of a work’s meaning over time, through interaction with audiences and publics, and  in space—the successive scenes of reception. Finally, G. declares that the chapters  that follow represent the practice of cultural history as much as an aesthetic project:  he wants to resist both an outdated positivism, whose account of reception consists of  no more than lists of books or events, and “new aesthetics,” which draws on Kantian  thinking to produce essentially ahistorical accounts. he closes by recommending, and  proposing to practice, both intermediality (the study of varied media—here, art, music,  </page> <page sequence="2"> 380 booK reviews and literature) and interdisciplinarity, the basis of a large-scale Cambridge research  project on Victorian culture, “Past versus Present: Abandoning the Past in an Age of  Progress,” in which he was involved. The first two chapters deal with paintings by J. W. Waterhouse and lawrence Alma- Tadema, two artists whose depictions of “classical” scenes are generally seen today  as technically expert semipornographic images, more at home on chocolate boxes  (or book covers) than on gallery walls. G.’s discussion of Waterhouse has interesting  things to say about the role of male desire as a potential threat to the security of the  male self. Alma-Tadema’s sappho is compared with those of simeon solomon and  the young Queen Victoria to provoke questions about the nature of reception, includ- ing the meanings of silence (lack of public comment). in these chapters the reader is  greatly helped by sixteen color illustrations, while perhaps unfairly wishing for more  (e.g., of degas’s Interior, strategically referred to on p. 63). Chapters 3 and 4 focus on Gluck and Wagner, at first sight an unlikely pairing. The  performance history of Gluck is a study in discontinuity, for he fell continually out  of fashion, to be revived and redefined through the nineteenth century, by Berlioz,  Wagner, and Charles Villiers stanford, among others. stanford is a pygmy among  giants in this context, but his 1890 Cambridge production of Gluck’s Orphée was, as  G. suggests, linked to the history of the local Greek Play, some of whose leading lights  (richard Jebb and Arthur Verrall) were involved in the production. G. gives an inci- sive account of Wagner’s remaking of Gluck, tracing the process of rewriting and re- production through which Gluck was appropriated as a Wagnerian modernist. Chapter  4 compares the 1871 and 1951 Bayreuth productions of The Ring, the latter designed  self-consciously to be different from the former. Wagner himself, G. argues, made hel- lenism integral to the nationalism underlying his production; his grandson Wieland,  after his revisionist production of 1951, invited the classical scholar (and nazi sym- pathizer) Wolfgang schadewaldt to lecture on Wagner and hellenism. schadewaldt’s  lectures avoided any mention of Wagner’s nationalism and anti-semitism; hellenism  was thus made into a safe and respectable home for the Wagnerian vision. The last three chapters turn to Victorian novels set in the roman empire, some by  well-known authors (e.g., edward Bulwer-lytton, John henry newman, Charles King- sley), others by writers now completely forgotten. This long section (pp. 153–264) is  based on an examination of nearly 200 nineteenth-century novels set in the roman  empire. Kingsley and newman presented in their novels their contrasting views of  religion, Kingsley attacking what he and his allies saw as the unmanliness and dis- honesty of Catholicism; the conflict later provoked newman to write his masterpiece  Apologia pro Vita Sua. The novels provided a way to declare views on the nature and  kinds of Christian belief, and G.’s expansive discussion enables him to look at a wide  range of such declarations. A central problem for novelists was to combine realistic  depiction of secular roman life with respect for Christian virtues and Christian living.  The problem was hard to escape, especially when writers engaged with Gospel narra- tive, as lew Wallace did in Ben Hur. Chapter 7, “Only connect!,” focuses on the lives  and works of Charles Kingsley and Frederic Farrar. The two make an interesting pair,  Kingsley’s combativeness and anguished sexuality contrasting strikingly with Farrar’s  social skills and often controversial theology. Kingsley’s novels are fueled by concerns  with race and nation, while Farrar’s often contain stories of educational development  that tie into his career as a schoolmaster. What links them, G. argues, is the writing  of novels as “an expression of the experience of historicity” (p. 263, his italics)—the  </page> <page sequence="3"> booK reviews 381 historical sense identified in his introduction as an eroder of Victorian certainties. in  his “Coda,” G. looks at the male nude photographs of Wilhelm von Gloeden and the  drawings by Andy Warhol based on them. his concern is to point to a surprising con- tinuity between twentieth-century high modernism and the Victorian art discussed in  his first two chapters. here modernity is well past its earlier proclamation, yet currents  from the Victorian past can still be found running strongly within it. As G. suggests in  his concluding paragraph, Victorian uses of antiquity are worth studying because our  own use of Victorian culture overlaps with Victorian uses of the classical past: “The  exercise of classical reception is, finally, finding one’s own place in history” (p. 272). This rather sprawling book is crammed full of imaginative and wide-ranging explo- rations of cultural phenomena, its case studies providing in-depth analysis of different  genres; it is also, as G. says, both “intermedial” and interdisciplinary. “Victorian”  in the book’s title implies a focus on Britain, so it is surprising that the chapters on  opera are set in continental europe, without any attempt at the comparison with Britain  that might have justified this (the same point might be made about the discussion of  Ben Hur). The exposition has its weak points. When G. locates his work in the field  of reception studies, the points from which he triangulates (old positivism and “new  aesthetics”) are so ahistorical that they come across as straw men representing extreme  positions; it is within the field whose margins they mark out that the interesting debates  are likely to take place. These two positions are very thinly described, and it is only  by following the reference on the latter that one is led to G.’s debate with Charles  martindale in edith hall and stephe harrop’s Theorizing Performance: Greek Drama,  Cultural History, and Critical Practice (2010). Again, G. tells us that reception is “a  process of more complex dynamics . . . than the standard model of influence and im- pact allows” (p. 83). This “standard model” is apparently one of considerable crudity,  but no examples are given. This enables G.’s own analyses to be contrasted to their  benefit, but while their virtues are undeniable, one wonders whether “the standard  model” can easily be found in recent work on reception. The treatment of disciplinarity  is brief and unsatisfactory; the excerpt quoted above from G.’s introduction portrays  a discipline (without defining it) as something that responds to threats with anger or  anxiety, a curiously old-fashioned anthropomorphism. The emergence of classics as an  academic subject, with its curricula, careers, and institutional locations, is an important  topic, but one that deserves a less fleeting and more nuanced treatment. it also needs  to incorporate a comparative dimension—the links between classics and institutional  religion are not common outside england, and as with the case of opera mentioned  above, we need to compare with other national cultures to see what is special about  that of Victorian england. G. is certainly right to juxtapose the story of Benjamin  Jowett the classical teacher and Platonist with that of Jowett the scandalously liberal  theologian, well-known stories too often kept apart in different discursive narratives.  One could, however, add a third story, less well known than either, of Jowett as one of  a group of young scholars (including henry liddell, robert scott, and Arthur stanley)  attempting to found a classical journal in the early 1840s—a story that bears directly  on the question of disciplinary development. Classical reception takes place through  teaching and scholarship, as well as through art, literature, and music, but G. is very  much in the mainstream in marginalizing this area. in his introduction G. rightly argues that students of Victorian classics have to  become familiar with the Victorian age, and several of his chapters show what can  be achieved by in-depth exploration of nineteenth-century British history. There are  </page> <page sequence="4"> 382 booK reviews moments, however, when lack of familiarity is revealed. For example, we learn that  Frederic Farrar’s liberal views on eternal punishment were denounced “by the Bishop  of lincoln amongst others” (p. 261). The relevant reference is given as “Wordsworth  (1878)” without comment, but anyone familiar with the period would know that Chris- topher Wordsworth and his brother Charles, Bishop of st. Andrews, were notoriously  extreme in their conservatism; they had published latin and Greek grammars to pro- mote uniformity in grammar and hence, they believed, in religion. This was not just a  Church grandee, but a particular incumbent of high office. At other times the problem  is one of exposition. For example, we are told (p. 259) that Farrar managed to live  down the fact that he had edited Essays on a Liberal Education (1867), then (p. 262)  the book is described as “celebrated,” but we are not told why it was celebrated, nor  why Farrar’s editorial role needed living down. (his editorial preface annoyed some  of the other contributors, but that was not generally known.) some points of detail. On p. 33: William sewell (who is not in the index) was not  Whyte’s professor of moral philosophy at Oxford when his novel Hawkstone came  out in 1845 (it would have been more useful to state that he was a pioneer teacher of  Plato in a traditionally Aristotelian university). On p. 83: note 58 is missing. On p. 117:  richard Jebb is referred to as being a knight and an mP in 1890, but was not an mP  till 1891, nor a knight till 1900. On p. 144: the illustration, which follows on from that  on the previous page, is neither labeled nor listed. The names of erving Goffman, lady  Chatterley, Christ Church (the Oxford college), and the Barberini Faun are misspelled.  The lack of page references in the headers of the endnote section makes the reader’s  experience unnecessarily difficult.
