<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEl PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI: TROPICAL FORAGERS OF THE NEW GUINEA RAINFOREST1 Paul Roscoe University of Maine Borut Telban Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts Ethnographic work in the Sepik Basin of New Guinea has been heavily biased toward the region's more dense and culturally elaborated communities. This article uses archival documentation and the results of rapid ethnographic surveys to reconstruct the contact- era ethnography of one of its lesser-known groups, the Lower Arafundi. The Lower Arafundi people were ethnographically significant as foragers of the tropical rainforest, as progenitors of a rock art tradition, and as one of a small circle of human societies that claim not to recognize paternity. (Hunters and gatherers, tropical foragers, New Guinea, Sepik, Lower Arafundi) Although the Sepik Basin of New Guinea was home to a contact population of only 300,000 to 500,000 people, it was among the most linguistically diverse regions on Earth, its inhabitants speaking well over 200 languages and at least twice that number of dialects (Laycock 1973:54). Notwithstanding this diversity, however, the Sepik has received much less anthropological attention than other areas of New Guinea, and its ethnographic coverage has been highly uneven. Most attention has focused on the large, high-density, artistically and ritually prolific groups of the Middle Sepik River and Maprik regions. The Abelam around Maprik, for example, have received sustained attention from at least eleven fieldworkers and more fleeting attention from more than six others. A similar order of interest has been applied to the Iatmul of the Middle Sepik. By contrast, fewer than ten scholars have conducted sustained fieldwork among the more than 70 smaller-scale, low-density societies of the whole of lowland Sandaun (West Sepik) Province. To avoid the biases imposed by anthropological field choices and achieve a more balanced understanding of Sepik contact-era ethnography, more attention has to be directed to these lesser-known groups. Unfortunately, with Western contact now more than a century along, such a task is increasingly difficult, and the likelihood of understanding much of the cultural context that motivated and informed contact-era behavior is slight. But for sketches of the broad contours of subsistence, settlement, social organization, and ritual life the situation is more hopeful. Anthropologists may have skirted most of the Sepik's less elaborate cultures, but they were not ignored by other Western agents. A surprisingly extensive, largely unpublished documentary record was left by various Sepik explorers, labor recruiters, missionaries, administra- tive officers, linguists, and occasional passing anthropologists. A major aim of this 93 ETHNOLOGY vol. 43 no. 2, Spring 2004, pp. 93-115.

Unfortunately, it is unrealistic simply to expect anthropologists to exploit this literature. For one thing, the costs in time and labor of gathering, translating, collating, and analyzing these scattered, often unpublished sources are enormous. For another, it is impractical to expect most scholars to have the level of familiarity with Sepik geography and history that is necessary to contextualize the material. Toward a modest remedy, therefore, we offer here a basic ethnography of one of the Sepik's lesser-known groups: the Lower Arafundi people of the East Sepik Province. In addition to their value in expanding and balancing the comparative knowledge of human society, the Lower Arafundi are anthropologically important for two reasons. The first is their ethnographic distinction. At contact, they comprised that supposed rarity among tropical forest peoples, a group living almost exclusively by hunting and gathering (cf. Bailey and Headland 1991; Bailey et al. 1989). They were progenitors of an important rock art tradition that used caves as cult structures functionally equivalent to men's houses, pointing to an important analogical transformation of ritual culture. And they were among that small circle of human societies that claim not to recognize paternity. Their second claim on anthropological interest is theoretical: they raise to especially sharp relief some of the difficulties associated with constructing the cultural units that underlie the comparative anthropological endeavor. THE ARAFUNDI ENVIRONMENT Scattered below and midway up the slopes of the Andogoro, Moirurtapa, and Kundiman mountains that separate East Sepik Province from the Enga and Western Highlands Provinces, the people of the Arafundi River region inhabit one of the more spectacular landscapes in New Guinea (Map). The limestone walls of their mountain homelands inspired awe in many early European visitors, "appearing perpendicular and completely white as though faced with cement, over which numerous small waterfalls cascade three or four thousand feet into the ARAFUNDI River" (ABN 1962:2). At the base of the mountains, the lowland environment is carpeted with tropical rainforest and sago swamp, and at contact was home to the Lower Arafundi communities. Midway up the mountains, located on massive, rainforested tablelands extending from both sides of the Arafundi River gorge, were the settlements of the Upland Arafundi (ABN 1966b:6, 1963:2; ANG 1950: Geo. note 1; Haberland 1966:36; KRW 1962:n.p.).</page><page sequence="3">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI * Imanmeri * Wamblamas LOWER ARAFUNDI Arafundi River - NORTHD J/ 0 31 i a6 " 'kilometers L ' c.i. . 200 meters ? x, X s &gt;~~~~~~7 Map: The Contact-Era Settlements of the Lower Arafundi People (Position of Angerat [Wandukumbayl approximate) 95 '1 ?) r J</page><page sequence="4">96 ETHNOLOGY LANGUAGES Originally, it was thought that the peoples of the Lower and Upper Arafundi spoke different languages, Alfendio and Meakambut, respectively (ABN 1962:6; Laycock 1973:40). By the late 1960s, however, administrative patrols were reporting mutual comprehension between the two peoples, and linguistic opinion now views them as sharing a common language, Arafundi. If this is so, however, it is a language with significant dialect differentiation, perhaps down to the level of individual communities (ABN 1966a:7, 1969, App. 2:1; Foley 1991:7-8; Grimes 1992:819, 2000; Williams 1993). Arafundi, once thought to be a linguistic isolate, appears to be unrelated to the Middle Sepik languages to its north. Foley (1991:7-8) suggests that it may be related to the Harwai, Hagahai, and Pinai languages spoken in the mountains to the east, in the head waters of the Yuat. Whether or not they spoke the same language, the lowland- and upland-dwellers exhibited marked cultural differences. As might be expected of people living in a swamp and floodplain ecosystem, the Lower Arafundi had canoes and could swim; in the mountains 200 to 400 meters above, the Upland Arafundi did not (ABN 1963:8). The two people had also adopted very different subsistence regimes. The lowland carbohydrate staple was sago, a palm that grows abundantly in low-altitude wetlands, while meat protein came primarily from hunting and fishing. In the uplands, sago also featured in the diet, but only as "an important subsidiary" to the shifting cultivation of sweet potato, yams, taro, and banana (ABN 1962:7, 1963:10, 1964a:3,5, 1965:7, 10, 1966a:map, 1969:map; Taylor 1938/39:323). In contrast to the lowlands, moreover, food-gathering was "comparatively unimportant," and meat protein was obtained primarily from domesticated pigs (ABN 1962:7). In the uplands, Arafundi settlements seem to have been dispersed and the people quite mobile. The population lived in "scattered homesteads" that made up loose village groups; and they were "always moving," as one garden was worked out and the family group relocated to establish another (ABN 1962:7, 1963:10). Their houses resembled those of the highlanders to their south rather than the Sepik house type favored by the lowland people to the north (ABN 1967a:4). Beyond this, unfortunate- ly, nothing is known of the Upper Arafundi people. By default, therefore, the rest of this ethnographic survey focuses on the Lower Arafundi and the contact-era communities of Awim, Imanmeri, Meakambut, and Wamblamas (or Wambramas) (Map).2 THE ETHNOGRAPHIC RECORD AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI The most important documentary source on the Lower Arafundi people is Haberland's (1966) brief ethnography based on a total of five days spent in the settlements of Awim, Warlamas (or Kapokmeri), Imanmeri, Yamandim, and Imboin in 1961 and 1963. Other sources include early patrol reports and census registers</page><page sequence="5">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI from the Angoram and Amboin Patrol Posts and information from several other observers who passed briefly through the region. These sources are supplemented by data that Telban (1997, 1998) gathered in three brief visits to the region: a nine-day trip in November 1990 to Kansimei, Imboin, and Meakambut; a seven-day visit to Imboin and Meakambut in January 1991; and a five-day trip in January 2001 to Warlamas, Yamandim, Awim, Imboin, and Kurinjang (Meakambut was by then deserted). In addition, he made many visits to Imanmeri during fieldwork in the Karawari village of Ambonwari. Combining unpublished field data with documentary material raises some citation difficulties. In what follows, ethnographic information taken solely from documentary sources is cited in the usual form; information unaccompanied by any citation derives solely from Telban's field research; and statements derived from both Telban's work and documentary sources (say, Haberland) are signaled as: "also Haberland 1966:40." CONTACT HISTORY Germany was the first colonial master of the Sepik, and Imanmeri people told Telban that their first encounter with Europeans was a visit from "German police," who took five men captive for fighting: they were said to have "hooked" their prisoners by the chin and to have taken them off to Ambunti, where they later died. The most likely German presence to which this incident refers is the Kaiserin Augusta FluB Expedition, which in 1912 established a base camp at what later became Ambunti Station. In December of that year or in January of the next, expedition members ventured some 65 kilometers up the Karawari River to a point no more than a dozen kilometers from Imanmeri (Anonymous 1913; Stolle 1912). There is no mention in the expedition's published reports of any excursion even close to the Imanmeri environs, let alone of captives being taken from the area. Since expedition members had little interest in pacifying the region, moreover, it is difficult to understand why their indigenous police would have been sent on such a mission. Possibly, indigenous police, carriers, or "shoot boys" from the expedition up the Karawari forayed off on their own and tangled with local people, as we know happened in other parts of the Sepik (e.g., Sukwianomb 1977). Alternatively, the incident might refer to an encounter with early German labor recruiters, whose activities are poorly known. Or, since Sepik people sometimes conflate the early years of Australian administration with "German times," the incident could refer to a later period of colonial history. Whatever the case, Lower Arafundi people experienced colonial contact at an early date. Notwithstanding its remoteness, the Arafundi gorge forms a natural pass from the Sepik into the highlands via the Maramuni River, and for some villagers their first experience with Europeans came in late 1928, when several gold prospectors worked their way up the Arafundi in hopes of striking it rich. In early 1930, some of the party returned, this time reaching Maramuni Enga territory (ABN 97</page><page sequence="6">98 ETHNOLOGY 1962:5; Beazley 1928: entries for 7/10 to 7/23; Shepherd 1971). Nine years later, Jim Taylor paused to admire the view from Aviemi, as he and John Black led the Hagen-Sepik patrol back up the river to Wabag (Taylor 1938/39:323). Missionary contacts with Wamblamas and Imanmeri began before the Second World War. Most likely, their first visitor was the peripatetic German priest, Francis Kirschbaum, who traveled widely through the Middle and Lower Sepik in the 1930s, but indigenous catechists were also early visitors: one was reportedly killed in Imanmeri. The first significant effects of contact, however, were not felt until the Second World War, when small parties of Europeans made their way up the Arafundi into the highlands as they fled ahead of the Japanese invasion (ABN 1963:2). Shortly afterwards, the Japanese established three camps along the river, near the present sites of Yamandim, Imboin, and Tungum. As the war turned against the Japanese, the billeted troops turned against the local people, killing them and their dogs, pigs, and game, and eventually villagers fled their settlements for the safety of temporary camps in the swamps, forests, and mountains. With the war over, the Australian administration began to patrol the region from Angoram, and by the late 1950s, luluais (village officials) had been appointed, censusing was well underway, and lumber had become a significant source of local revenue (ANG 1961:n.p.; Forge 1959a: entry for 23 May). Missionaries made contact with the Awim, issuing edicts against the male spirit cult and burning sacra from their men's house. In 1962, a Patrol Post and elementary school were established at Amboin, and the Lower Arafundi now fell under sustained administra- tive influence. Patrols from Amboin pushed into Upland Arafundi territory, which until then had remained uncontacted to "all extents and purposes," and in 1966, the last Lower Arafundi settlement group, Meakambut, was finally contacted by the administration (ABN 1963:2, 1966a:8). The effects of these contacts were manifold. As a result of missionary influence, warring, head-hunting, and cannibalism appear to have declined in the northern villages even before the war. By the 1950s, fighting was mainly limited to the Upland Arafundi groups, and the Meakambut were eventually "pacified" in the mid-1960s (ABN 1963:2, 1966a:8). Perhaps because the Arafundi is a natural trade route, steel tools were widely spread at an early date, and even upland areas were said to have abandoned stone implements many years before the 1960s (though steel tools and other European artifacts were still rare among the Meakambut in 1966) (ABN 1962:6, 1966a:7). By the early 1960s, the lingua franca, Tok Pisin, was widely spoken in the lowland settlements, though it was still rare among the upland groups in the late 1960s (ABN 1962:6, 1963:8, 1967b:5). By the mid-1960s, traditional lowland dress had largely vanished except, again, among the Meakambut, who remained traditionally garbed as late as 1991 (ABN 1967a:6; Haberland 1966:40). In the 1950s, settlement patterns began to change markedly. Around 1955, the Wamblamas community, located in the midst of extensive and dense sago swamps near Pakut Lake, began to break up. By 1961, partly under administrative pressure,</page><page sequence="7">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI two sections had moved some five kilometers to the banks of the Arafundi to form Kapokmeri (modern-day Warlamas, a corruption of "Wamblamas") and Yamandim villages, with a third, smaller section, Kurinjang, migrating to the vicinity of Imanmeri village. Sometime before 1960, Mungkumbay hamlet of Awim village group migrated from the mountains down toward the Arafundi to secure better access to governmental services. Unfortunately, they failed to reckon with the Arafundi's flash floods, and after several inundations, they retreated to higher ground (ABN 1966b:6; ANG 1954:n.p., 1961:n.p.; Haberland 1966:38-39). As elsewhere in the Middle Sepik (Roscoe n.d.), population levels were affected by introduced diseases, including tuberculosis and influenza, but the scale of these losses is difficult to gauge (ABN 1969:n.p., 4). Western influence also affected subsistence. At contact, some lowland communi- ties subsisted almost entirely by hunting and gathering, but with their moves to firmer ground and with the spread of new cultivars, some began light cultivation of sweet potato, bananas, pumpkin, taro, sugar cane, papaya, aibika, beans, maize, pineapple, watermelons, and cucumbers. Sago-planting increased as people moved away from their traditional groves of wild sago, and in the 1960s, with administrative encouragement, some groups began to plant coconuts (KRW 1962:n.p.). As missionary activities picked up in the 1950s, religious beliefs and practices also started to change. "God" began to feature in myth, and some villages burned their cult paraphernalia. In Imanmeri, initiation was abandoned around 1950, though reportedly it is still practiced among the Meakambut. Mortuary rites were radically modified or abandoned, above-ground mortuary displays and interments giving way to burial and mourning periods undergoing marked reductions in duration. The Meakambut were the last of the Lower Arafundi groups to be affected by European contact. When Telban first visited them in 1991, many had abandoned their hamlets for the Yuat River region, but a remnant camp of eleven remained in their houses near rock shelters at the base of the mountains. They continued to live almost entirely by hunting and gathering, the men still wore kina-shell necklaces and cordyline leaves under a bark belt, and the women were dressed in grass skirts. When he revisited the area in 2001, however, the group had disappeared: some members had died, others had migrated to the Maramuni Enga region, and a few had moved to Kansimei village. SUBSISTENCE According to Haberland (1966:56), the Arafundi people followed "a purely collecting [subsistence] based on the use of wild sago, on the collection of wild vegetables and insects (sago-grubs), and in very modest volume also on fishing and hunting." Haberland (1966:56) was emphatic that "only wild growing sago is made use of"; indeed, planted sago was "unknown." People differentiated "good" sago from "bad" or wild sago, "but that has nothing to do with whether sago is planted or occurs wild" (Haberland 1966:57); rather, it differentiated high- and low-yielding 99</page><page sequence="8">100 ETHNOLOGY palm varieties. The better varieties were used for their starch, the poorer for their white, leafy shoots and for the collection of sago grubs (Haberland 1966:57). Since he did not visit the Upland Arafundi people, Haberland was unaware that much of their diet came from extensive cultivation and pig-rearing (see above). As a description of the lowland subsistence regime, however, his claims are more accurate. By the 1990s, Telban found that every Lowland Arafundi group planted some sago, but the Wamblamas and Meakambut people confirmed that before contact they had subsisted solely on wild sago. By contrast, Imanmeri and Awim claimed sago-planting to be an ancestral as well as a contemporary practice, a puzzling assertion since Haberland collected information from both settlements and was so emphatic in his assertions to the contrary. A possible resolution, though, lies in his curious and seemingly contradictory remark that "the cultivation of sago is without importance in contrast to the use of wild stands" (Haberland 1966:56). Perhaps, then, Awim and Imanmeri indulged in occasional sucker-planting before as well as after contact, but Haberland either missed it or considered it only nominal. In addition to sago, the Lower Arafundi also gathered a variety of bush vegetables, including (in rough order of importance) Gnetum gnemon leaves, ferns, wild yams, fungi, and berries. Fishing by scoop net, trap, dam, and very occasional- ly bow and arrow was practiced "in very modest volume," mostly yielding small fish, eels, and turtles (Beazley 1928: entry for 15 July; Haberland 1966:56). Haberland believed hunting to be "just as unimportant in the economy" as fishing, but Telban's impression was that hunting of wild pigs, cassowaries, marsupials, and snakes with the bow and arrow was important to the diet (Haberland 1966:37, 56, 59, 60). Sago grubs and eggs were also collected. With the possible exception of Imanmeri, coconuts did not appear in the area until after contact, and even then were used "not so much for food" as for ritual purposes (Haberland 1966:59). Although conditions are favorable in some areas, "cultivation disappears completely" among the Lower Arafundi (Haberland 1966:37). It is "now as ever not practiced. . . . Tubers-taro, yam and sweet potato-are unknown" (Haberland 1966:59). Other early observers generally agreed, although by 1961, the presence of bananas had been noted, and Telban was told they were planted prior to contact in Imanmeri (ANG 1954:n.p.; KRW 1962:n.p.; RTNG 1939:23). Betel nut, an intoxicant rather than a food, was planted in some, though not all, villages (Beazley 1928: entry for 15 July; Haberland 1966:59). Livestock (pigs and fowl) were part of the contact-era subsistence suite among the Upland Arafundi (ABN 1965:10, 1966a: 10), and stock was observed postcontact in the lowlands (KRW 1962:n.p.). If the Lower Arafundi consumed domesticated meat at contact, it was in small amounts at most. A 1950 patrol of the region remarked that, in general, "there were very few pigs and fowls" (ANG 1950: Ag. note 1), and Haberland makes no mention of livestock whatsoever.</page><page sequence="9">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOR Women's work involved washing sago flour, trap fishing, collecting firewood, making salt, cooking, sewing sago leaves into thatch, and cleaning around the house. Men's tasks included warfare, felling and pounding the sago palm, helping women wash sago flour, hunting, catching fish by damming waterways, and making houses and canoes. In postcontact times, men have also taken up gardening and clearing their settlements of grass. TRADE Haberland (1966:38) observed that cultural influences from societies to the north were heavily stamped on Arafundi culture, indicating extensive precontact trade and exchange links. These links were primarily through Yimas to the northwest rather than the Karawari villages directly to the north (Haberland 1966:37). To Yimas, the Lower Arafundi people exported sago, sago grubs, pandanus, aibika, tobacco, betelnut, Piper betel, needles and saws of flying-fox bone, an aromatic bark popular for hunting magic, bows and arrows, stone axes and adzes, and tree trunks for making canoes (ABN 1962:6). In return, they received from Yimas mats, baskets, mosquito bags, fish, kina shells, and lime for chewing betelnut (Foley 1991:13-14; Haberland 1966:57; Haberland and Seyfarth 1974:70, 100, 107). Clay pots and ovens from Aibom and Chambri came through Yimas, but pottery from the Koiwat- Kamangaui area and the Yaul and Dimeri pottery villages to the northeast entered via Kansimei (Haberland 1966:38, 59). Shells also may have entered from this direction: a patrol officer observed shell necklaces among the Meakambut that appeared to have come from the Murik Lakes, 130 kilometers to the northeast (ABN 1967b:7). To the south, a trade route ran via the Upper Arafundi and Maramuni Rivers into Enga. The Maramuni Enga traveled to the upland villages of Tungum and Pundugum, where they traded tobacco and string bags for lime, betel nut, and kina shells that had come up the Arafundi River (Williams 1995:1-2). Some tobacco also went in the other direction, and an occasional Jimi Valley axe blade passed down river (Haberland 1966:37). Williams (1993, 1995:4) reports the existence of a "trade pidgin" associated with these exchanges. PERSONAL AND MATERIAL CULTURE In the Meakambut area, both sexes shaved the head back to the crown and, on ceremonial occasions at least, women painted faint designs on the exposed front. At the back, men wore their hair in strands about twenty centimeters long, and both sexes sometimes plaited the hair with brown mud to create a stringy effect (ABN 1966a:7, 1967a:6-7, 1967b:7; Taylor 1938/39:322-23). There was some variation in traditional dress. In some places, male costume was comprised of a girdle of twisted bast cord or cane, with cordyline leaves over the 101</page><page sequence="10">102 ETHNOLOGY rear and knitted string aprons or cordyline leaves over the genitals. In other areas, small bark loincloths were observed (ABN 1967a:6, 1967b:7; Haberland 1966:40; Taylor 1938/39:323). Women wore full bast-string skirts (Haberland 1966:40; Taylor 1938/39:322). Body ornaments included kina-shell necklaces; large shells woven into chest bands; shell-encrusted belts; and arm- and leg-bands of woven bast, decorated with nassa and cowrie shells (ABN 1967a:6, 1967b:7-8; Haberland 1966:40). Unfortunate- ly, it is unclear which sex wore what ornaments. The Meakambut pierced the sides of the nostrils, presumably to take bones or quills, but this was not the custom elsewhere (Haberland 1966:40-41). Haberland (1966:37, 40), who had conducted field research among several Middle Sepik peoples, emphasized the general poverty of Lower Arafundi material culture. "It is difficult," he lamented, "to collect artifacts that were more than quickly thrown-together bast pieces, little sharpened sticks, or simple baulks of timber" (Haberland 1966:45). Certainly, people got by with a limited range of material goods. The postcontact, hybrid settlement of Imboin used rocks from the Arafundi River to manufacture sago-pounders and make axes and adzes out of stone from the mountains, but it is unclear whether this was characteristic of other settlements. Pottery was imported, not manufactured (Haberland 1966:37, 59, 46), and in some areas large, flat stones, about 30 centimeters across and three centimeters thick, were used for frying sago pancakes. Imanmeri made canoes from sago bark, and the people of Imboin occasionally used rafts, but whether watercraft were more widespread than this is unknown (Haberland 1966:39). Other items of local manufacture included neck rests, wooden bowls, carved wooden suspension hooks, coconut-shell spoons, decorated combs, and netbags (Haberland 1966:41, 46, 48-49). Houses generally were simpler and more modestly designed versions of Middle and Lower Sepik buildings. They measured about six meters by four and a half meters, not including the porches frequently attached at one or both ends, and comprised two post-borne scaffolds made from tree trunks, one to bear the floor, the other enveloping it to take the walls and roof. Floorboards were of bark; walls were made from lined and interlocking sago-frond stems; and the roof was of shingles sewn from sago fronds. Doorways were square, two-thirds of a meter on the side and placed halfway up the front wall (and sometimes the back), and were closed with poles and buttress-root planks (ABN 1962:7; Haberland 1966:37, 41-43; Taylor 1938/39:322). Fireplaces were comprised of either shallow bark cylinders filled with earth and topped with stones, or slabs of earth-covered wood suspended from the roof and let into the bark floor (Haberland 1966:45).3 Meakambut houses differed in that they were built directly on the ground rather than on piles (ABN 1967a:9).</page><page sequence="11">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI SETTLEMENT AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION Data on Lowland Arafundi settlement and social organization are fragmentary, but there is nothing to contradict Haberland's (1966:60) contention that most people lived not in the nucleated, politically autonomous villages common elsewhere in the Sepik but "in patrilineal descent groups arranged in small hamlets of which several joined together as a community." In the lowlands, there were four such communities: Awim, Imanmeri, Meakambut, and Wamblamas (with Imboin a postcontact development). Postcontact changes and the survival of only a few early census registers make it difficult to assess with precision the density and sizes of these communities, but best estimates indicate that densities were low, around two square kilometers, and that community sizes varied from about 40-50 for Meakambut and for each of the two hamlets of Awim community, to 125-175 for Wamblamas, to 175-200 for Imanmeri.4 The people of these four communities were divided among one or more "small hamlets of at most only a few houses," each having a men's house as its "religious center" (Haberland 1966:38-39). Telban established that contact-era Wamblamas comprised two hamlets, Aurim and Kambraman (named for their respective men's houses). Awim was also composed of two hamlets, Mungkumbay (also called Awim) and Wandukumbay (or Angerat), but at contact Awim seems to have been in the process of fissioning into two one-hamlet communities. Wandukumbay was located some distance into the hills behind Mungkumbay and was reportedly fighting with the Pundungay clan from Mungkumbay. Meakambut seems to have had two "village sites" (ABN 1966a:map, 1967a:6); and Imanmeri was a nucleated village of three hamlets (Forge 1959a: entry for 28 May). These data suggest that the average size of a hamlet could be anywhere from about twenty (Meakambut), to 40 (Awim), to about 60-80 (Imanmeri, Wamblamas). In addition to their central hamlet, people also had sago-processing and hunting camps scattered through the surrounding country- side, though the Awim and Meakambut communities probably made more use of these temporary shelters than Wamblamas and Imanmeri. Haberland (1966:39, 60) understood that, at contact, each hamlet was home to a single, named, land-holding patrilineal clan and its men's house, and that each hamlet was located in the middle of its clan's lands. This appears to have been the case for Awim and possibly also Meakambut. In Wamblamas, each clan appears to have had its own men's house in theory (each, at least, possessed a men's house name) but at contact each of the two hamlets contained several clans that shared a single men's house. In the Kambraman hamlet, a pair of clans shared the men's house known as Kambraman; in the other hamlet, about eight clans shared the Auriman men's house. In Imanmeri, where about twelve clans were distributed among three hamlets, there were as many as nine men's houses in total. Clearly, therefore, some Imanmeri clans shared the same men's house, and some hamlets must have had more than one men's house. In Imanmeri, one men's house 103</page><page sequence="12">104 ETHNOLOGY (Yanjanman) was considered the father of the village, but whether this was the case in the other communities is unknown. Clans were apparently exogamous and claimed one or more totems and sets of personal names as their patrimony. In Imanmeri and Wamblamas, we estimate, clans averaged about fifteen people; in Awim and Meakambut, about twenty to 40. Each comprised a number of named lineages or "house groups," one of which was considered the head lineage. DESCENT, KINSHIP, AND MARRIAGE Meakambut appears to be among that small circle of human communities that deny paternity. Telban was told that sex was purely a recreation, unconnected with procreation. Babies, it was said, were formed of a mother's blood. Whether the same belief prevailed in the other lowland communities is unknown. Land and names descended patrilineally, and brothers shared the same forest property. In Imanmeri, the firstborn son, assuming he was competent, was entrusted with lineage affairs. Here and in Wamblamas, he stayed with his parents as they aged, while his younger brothers hived away to build separate houses of their own. In Awim, by contrast, every son eventually moved out of his parents' house. Telban's census in 2001 revealed that an average of some eight to ten people inhabited a house. Table 1 displays basic kinship terminologies for male Ego that Telban received from the Imanmeri and Wamblamas communities. (The Awim terminology is essentially that of Wamblamas, but amay (mother, etc.) becomes am; masak (wife's parent, etc.) becomes mayak; father is designated as; and elder brother is opuk.) Postmarital residence was virilocal, and in the past marriage appears to have been largely endogamous to the political community. As a result, a community's clans must have been bound to one another by a dense network of affinal ties. Contact and pacification degraded this practice significantly, and marriages are now forged not only with other Lowland Arafundi communities but also with Yimas-speakers. Polygyny was practiced, but it is unclear how prevalent it was. In most Lowland Arafundi communities, the marriage preference was for an exchange of real or classificatory sisters, with the groom "following the path" of his paternal grandfather; i.e., marrying into his father's mother's clan. In the large settlement of Imanmeri, marriage is said to be "one way," possibly the FMBSD marriage practiced among the neighboring Karawari (Telban 1998:122). Nowadays, bridewealth accompanies these exchanges, each side giving the other an equal amount of cash. If recent practice in Imboin reflects past practice among the Lowland Arafundi communities, however, payments once took the form of shells, bows and arrows, stone axes, and clay pots.</page><page sequence="13">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI Table 1: Wamblamas and Imanmeri Partial Kinship Terminologies, Male Ego W baas an i amblamas Imanmeri Wamblamas Imanmeri FF apa apay eB/yBa apa/unuk apay/wunuk FM aya, ayap ayam Z nambraik nambraik MF/MM aya, ayap ayam ZD papa, papuk nongurayk F apui asay ZDH wundak FeB/FyB apui ayam/sasay ZS papa, papuk inyinbik FeBW/FyBW amay ayamnamba/ S nongurak nongurak sasaynamba FZ apui away SW nonguraknamba angay FZH wundak awaynumba SS unuk wununuk FZS/FZD aya, ayap SD nambraik nambraik M amay angay D nongurayk nongurayk MZ amay angay DH nongurayknumba wunimbik MZH apui DHF masakb luk MBR papa, papuk papay DHM masakb wunimbiknamba MBSa iwk luk W nambuk, namba nambuk, namba MBSD angay WF/WM masakb masak MBD amay angay WeZ/WyZ wundik ukyik/wundik MBDH apui WB wundak wundak WBS/WBD away a In both villages, the terms for wife of eB, yB, MB, and MBS are formed by adding namba, meaning "woman/wife of."

RELATIONS AMONG POLITICAL COMMUNITIES According to Haberland (1966:60), a latent state of war prevailed among political communities, and Telban's lists of allies and enemies confirm that every community seemed to count every other as a potential enemy. Enmities also extended across language boundaries: Wamblamas and Imanmeri warred with Yimas and Kansimei, and Imanmeri also fought the Karawari villages of Ambonwari and Kundiman, the last large-scale fight taking place in 1972 (Telban 1997:26). These enmities in turn shaped alliances across language boundaries: various Wamblamas clans allied with Ambonwari and Kundiman in attacking Imanmeri, while Yimas's only ally among the Arafundi was Awim (Foley 1991:15; Forge 1959b:1; Telban 1998:148). Throughout much of the Sepik, settlement groups were mutual defensive units and nucleation (on high ground where possible) was the defensive strategy (Roscoe 1996). This was probably the case for Imanmeri and Wamblamas, but on at least 105</page><page sequence="14">106 ETHNOLOGY some occasions the Awim hamlet of Mungkumbay used a contrary strategy: flight to a mountain fastness. When enemy reprisals were feared, families fled to the far side of a ridge overlooking their hamlet, from which they could guard the only two routes up the mountain (Sullivan 1998). If the causes of contact-era warfare can be judged from those of postcontact fights, then disputes over land, women, theft from tobacco gardens, stealing sago grubs from a felled palm, destruction of betel palms, and revenge for deaths from sorcery or physical attack were the main reasons for attacks on other communities (ABN 1965:6; ANG 1950, Native Situation Report: 1). War took the form of head- hunting assaults, and ambush was a common form of attack, "mostly of the kind in which a heavily-armed war group assaulted a single woman at her sago work in the forest" (Haberland 1966:60). Lulling the enemy into a false sense of security, with the promise of making peace, for example, was also a "favorite method" of attack (ABN 1965:6). Both Haberland (1966:60) and the Amboin Patrol Post (ABN 1967a:8) believed that cannibalism was unknown. This was true of Meakambut, but other Lower Arafundi villages clearly managed to hide the practice from outsiders. In Awim, people told Telban that human flesh was consumed in the past, and Wamblamas people related that they cooked and ate the flesh of heads they had taken. The practice appears to have been ritualized: in Wamblamas, it was part of the ceremony associated with head-hunting; in Awim, it was confined to men, with the cooking conducted in the men's house.5 In contrast to the Middle Sepik, the bow and arrow rather than the spear and shield were the primary weapons of war (Haberland 1966:50). In Awim, Telban learned, it was customary in some attacks for shield- and spear-bearers to advance as a front line, followed by warriors armed with bows and arrows. The Wamblamas also claimed that smaller men generally carried shields. Nonetheless, shields and spears were said to be of secondary importance, rare in some villages and entirely absent in Meakambut (ABN 1996a:7; Haberland 1966:50, 53). Bows were of blackpalm, notched or fitted with rattan collars to take the bow string (Haberland 1966:52). Meakambut bows were longer than a man was tall (ABN 1967a:7). Most arrows were in two sections, with a cane shaft some 120 centimeters long, and a hardwood tip averaging 40-55 centimeters. Bamboo-tipped arrows had, in addition, a wooden splice to hold the blade (Haberland 1966:52). Meakambut arrows were "viciously barbed," their points facing in opposite directions, and some were tipped with cassowary bone (ABN 1966a:7, 1967a:7). Cassowary-bone daggers, some decoratively engraved, were especially common (ABN 1966a:7, 1967a:7; Haberland 1966:52). Notwithstanding the general state of hostility among the four political communi- ties, fragile periods of peace occasionally broke out, during which feasting replaced violent interaction (ANG 1950, Native Situation Report:1; Haberland 1966:60). Peace-making in Awim involved breaking spears and exchanging bows, cassowary- bone daggers, and shells. In Wamblamas, lime containers were smashed. No</page><page sequence="15">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI payments were made to compensate war killings. The most elaborate description of a peace-making ceremony is from 1966, when two patrol officers oversaw a conciliation between Meakambut and the postcontact settlement of Imboin (ABN 1966a:2, 6). Each side in turn pantomimed the firing of arrows, and one then presented the other with a large bundle of arrows decorated with shell necklaces and other ornaments. POLITICAL LEADERSHIP Next to nothing is known of Lowland Arafundi leadership, but if other low-density Sepik Hill communities, such as the Sanio-Hiowe, are any guide, this may reflect its attenuated nature as much as the absence of data (Townsend 1978). We know only that Wamblamas had a fight leader with ritual powers who entered battle behind a shield carried by another warrior. RITUAL AND RELIGION It is impossible to piece together anything approaching a complete picture of Lowland Arafundi cosmology, but what is known suggests significant similarities with Middle Sepik societies to the north. The main denizens of the spirit world were ancestral ghosts, bush spirits, and certain mythical heroes. The most important culture hero was a mountain spirit nowadays equated with God and known as Awi in Awim, Api in Meakambut, and by other names in other villages. In an origin myth that has a common structure throughout the Arafundi and Karawari river areas, Awi is said to have become jealous that his younger brother is married while he, Awi, is still single. In high dudgeon, Awi therefore leaves, traveling down the Arafundi. Eventually, he encounters a human family and is astonished to discover that they have no anuses. He provides them with anuses, creates a man and a woman, and ordains that women henceforth will menstruate and give birth. Then he makes a huge men's house, the remains of which are nowadays believed to be a cavern called kopau in a mountainous rock face to the south of Meakambut territory. Within this structure, he prepares two clay pots and fills them with blood from his penis, thereby providing the central motif for male initiation. From his blood, many humans are born and grow to maturity in the men's house. Meanwhile Awi has married, and his first son is involved in a misunderstanding that results in the creation of the modern human world. Most of the men in Awi's men's house are obliged to abandon it, becoming sorcerers, sanguma men, healers, light-skinned men, and dark-skinned men. When they leave the men's house, they take with them and bring into the world the hourglass drum, the stone axe, and one of the clay pots. The men who remain in the house become the spirits who now inhabit the mountains. Meakambut, the last group to emerge, remain close to the entrance, as guardians of the mountain and of the rock shelter containing the other creation pot. 107</page><page sequence="16">108 ETHNOLOGY Thus runs the first part of the myth. The second part is always specific to particular clans and tells how, following the emergence of the ancestors from their "stone vagina," the creation pot, they travel along different paths in different directions, usually as pairs of brothers. These brothers have various adventures, encounter different spirits and other ancestors, meet their first women, and so on, and the myth ends with them eventually settling in their modern clan territory. The ancestral spirits mentioned in this tale are known as mima or mema (male) and miminam (female). Although they can move freely around the landscape, they are believed to have their own settlements, separate from those of the living. In Awim, they are said to live in two hamlets on neighboring hills, the sites of which are tabooed. People also believe in bush spirits: those associated with pools and streams are called taikia or taykia (male) and taikianam or taykianam (female); those dwelling in mountains are called tangurang; and those associated with ficus trees are yakway. Tewi, the spirits associated with "stone houses" (i.e., rock caves) are particularly important forms of bush spirit and presumably were intimately associated with the ritual conducted in these shelters (see below). Male initiation was practiced in every Lowland Arafundi community, but its links to the spirit world-indeed, even the emic reasons for practicing it-are unknown. In whatever cause, initiands were secluded for about a week; in Awim and possibly also Meakambut, they were secluded in caves in the mountain walls. During this time, bamboo flutes were played, and the young men learned a variety of ritual secrets, including the names of spirits associated with various carvings. Scarification was practiced in Wamblamas, but in Awim and Meakambut youths had their penes bled instead. Awim boys had cane reeds shoved into the urethra; they then bathed their hands in the spurting blood and, as a "mark of their bravery," pressed their bloody handprints along the walls of their cave shelter (Sullivan 1998). In Meakam- but, the rite was similar to that practiced in Imboin: the young boy sat on the floor with his legs in front of him, and an initiated, unmarried man standing behind him then pierced his own penis, splashing some of his blood over the boy's back. The rest of the blood was wrapped in a sago leaf along with ginger and salt, which the initiand then ate, forging a ritual relationship between the pair. Another man standing behind the initiand then bled the boy's penis by cutting the urethra at its head. In Meakambut, where initiation was still practiced in 1990, the boy's blood was rubbed on his arm bands along with earth. In Imanmeri where, according to the origin myth, dogs ate feces, novices were fed human feces mixed with lime to make them as ferocious in fighting as dogs. As elsewhere in this region of the Sepik, male initiation was probably bound up with the ritual complex surrounding head-hunting. Following successful raids, enemy skulls were cleansed of soft tissue and hung in the men's house (Sullivan 1998). In Wamblamas, one particularly large, precontact men's house was said to have had one corner that displayed Yimas heads and another the skulls of Awim victims. Enemy skulls may have been overmodeled with clay and painted (Haberland 1966:60). In</page><page sequence="17">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI contrast to the Middle Sepik, successful headhunters did not carry special lime gourds or lime spatulas (Haberland 1966:59). The Lower Arafundi also practiced first menstruation rites. The young woman was usually secluded in a fenced-off section of a dwelling house for anywhere between one and two weeks (Awim), a month (Wamblamas), or up to three months (Imanmeri). Of this and the remainder of Lowland Arafundi ritual life, however, little is known. While at peace, political communities feasted one another on a regular basis (Haberland 1966:60). And in Wamblamas, achievement rites called napn, similar to the Iatmul naven and Karawari kurang, were conducted when a man completed a new house, killed his first pig, made a canoe, or went to a far place and returned. As in naven, mother's brothers carried the man on their shoulders, "mothers" washed him in the river, and he had to walk over the legs of his "fathers" and "mothers." RITUAL STRUCTURES AND RITUAL ART As noted, each Lowland Arafundi hamlet had at least one men's house (umbuy) that was the focus of male ritual activity and barred to women. Externally, these structures bore little difference to dwelling houses (ABN 1962:7; Haberland 1966:43). Inside, they were commonly divided into an earthen-floored anteroom, where married men slept at night, and a back room with a low, bark-covered platform and walls lined with bark paintings, where unmarried, initiated men slept and where ritual paraphernalia were stored (ABN 1962:7; Haberland 1966:43). In one Wablamas men's house, these sacra included a woven basket containing a stone, murum, said to be a taikia spirit that could destroy the settlement if it were broken. In an Imanmeri men's house, the first ancestors are believed to be embodied in a spear, a sago-pudding stick, a paddle, and a slit drum. The cliffs that rise behind the lowland settlements are riddled with rock shelters. These caves are typically long, narrow, and often difficult and dangerous to reach, involving traverses along narrow ledges and scrambles up steep slopes using handholds (Gorecki and Jones 1987a; Sullivan 1998). Many were used simply as casual hunting camps, but Awim and Meakambut appear to have used some of them as functional equivalents of men's houses. They were heavily imbued with religious power associated with ancestral myths, their approaches were decorated with ritually significant groves of cordyline and bamboo, and access was denied to uninitiated men and to women. They were profusely decorated with cave art and contained carved stone and wooden statuary, flutes, enemy skulls, and other sacra. In some cases, more than 60 meters of cave wall or roof were covered with continuous panels of paintings. In the 1960s, art collectors visiting the Lower Arafundi villages took away much of the portable ritual paraphernalia stored in these caves, but not until 1987 were Europeans permitted to visit the caves themselves and a research team from the Department of Prehistory at the Australian National University was able to document 109</page><page sequence="18">110 ETHNOLOGY some of the artwork they contained (ABN 1966b:7; Gorecki and Jones 1987a, 1987b; Sullivan 1998). Ritual use of these caves appears to have a considerable antiquity, and Awim and Meakambut were probably still using them at contact (ABN 1967a:6, 1967b:8; Gorecki and Jones 1987a, 1987b:5; Sullivan 1998). As related in the region's origin myth, some of the stone artifacts they contained were believed to be the origin source of the people of the Middle Sepik and, in postcontact times, of Europeans (ABN 1967a:6, 1967b:8). Sullivan (1998), who visited one cave associated with Awim, was told that male initiations were once held there, and the faint, bloody handprints of initiates apparently were still discernible. Lower Arafundi art was almost exclusively embedded in ritual life. The bark paintings displayed in the men's house were part of a ritual cycle, some apparently associated with initiation (Foley pers. comm.; Haberland 1966:44). Averaging some 130 by 40 centimeters and bound by rattan loops to the walls, they were executed in charcoal and white and red-brown earth paints, and were intended as stand-alone pieces rather than elements of an overall design. Spiral and eye-like motifs dominated, some juxtaposed in heart-shaped, anthropomorphic designs, others in wave-like meanders known as "running dog." Fish motifs also recurred (Haberland 1966:43-44, Table 13). According to one patrol officer, the designs were "supposed to represent the expressions of the spirit world" (ABN 1962:7). Slit-drum manufacture was confined to Imanmeri (Haberland 1966:54). Other ritual objects included hand drums, wooden trumpets associated with head-hunting, and bamboo flutes played during initiation (Haberland 1966:54-55). MAGIC AND SORCERY Lower Arafundi communities were known for a type of decorated, aromatic bark used in hunting magic. Its smell was believed to attract game, and, along with invocations to bush spirits, fragments were mixed into fish or fried sago and either eaten by the hunter himself or fed to his hunting dog. People feared both sorcerers (angum) and sanguma (omay), though, in contrast to much of the Sepik, wrongdoing was as much a cause of death as sorcery. Sanguma are believed to be human fiends who maraud occasionally across the countryside, waylaying lone travelers and performing magical operations on them that result in their death a few days later. (Among the Lowland Arafundi, they are believed to come from the uplands.) In many areas of the Sepik, sanguma beliefs are a postcontact innovation, but it is unclear whether this was so for the Arafundi; nor is it known whether the daggers made of human thigh bone that Haberland (1966:52) was told were used in magical attacks were part of sorcery or sanguma attack. Various methods were used to divine the cause of death. In Wamblamas, a bone of the deceased was taken to the home of the ancestor spirits (see above), and people awaited a sign of the cause of death. Another method, which took place under cover of darkness, used a long stick thrust through the floor planking of the house in which</page><page sequence="19">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI the corpse lay. People then called out the names of suspected individuals, clans, or causes and heard the spirit of the deceased tap out a "yes" or "no" answer. MORTUARY RITES It was customary to allow a corpse to decompose until only the skeleton remained. In Imanmeri and Wamblamas, the body was placed in a specially constructed shelter or suspended in palm sheath under the roof of a house: the men's house if it was male, a domestic house if it was female. In Imanmeri, once decomposition was complete, the skull was decorated and stored along with the bones in the family house. In Wamblamas, it was decorated with clay and placed in the house, but the bones were buried. In Awim and Meakambut, the body was placed on a roofed platform in the forest. Among the Meakambut, it was then sometimes buried in a sitting position. After decomposition, the skull and bones were carried away and deposited in a rock shelter (ABN 1964b:5). CONCLUSION Although the principal aim of this article has been to present a basic ethnography of a poorly known, tropical-forest, foraging community, it is important to emphasize a methodological issue. The Lower Arafundi case brings to especially sharp relief the artificiality of identifying the ethnography of any Sepik culture and the cautions this raises for the comparative ethnological endeavor. Douglas Newton, who traveled widely through the Middle and Upper Sepik in the 1960s, drew attention some years ago to the unusually fluid nature of Sepik social organization. Sepik communities, he wrote, "are the result of groups of people, under the pressures of fighting, famine, or for other reasons, having moved about freely and regrouped as they could. Consequently no village is a monolithic unit. It is, rather, a more or less stable congeries of clans having closer ties with each other than with those of other places" (Newton 1975:197). This constant cultural miscegenation has the paradoxical consequence of generating unique cultural communities while simultaneously homogenizing Sepik culture. As each Sepik community forms out of these ongoing kin-group migrations, it becomes in a sense a unique "experiment," a coalescence of clans from different origins with different histories. As each community forms, moreover, it finds itself uniquely positioned relative to major trade routes and other cultural groups, generating a yet more idiosyncratic cultural trajectory. At the same time, the fissioning of these communities and the dispersal of their component kin groups to other communities serves to homogenize the cultural milieu, injecting the culture of the dissolving community into other regions, where processes of trade and exchange spread it even wider. These processes are even more pronounced in hunter-gatherer groups like those of the Lower Arafundi that have a higher mobility than the norm. Telban's oral I11</page><page sequence="20">112 ETHNOLOGY histories of the region are littered with kin-group migrations precipitated by sickness or death, fear of enemies, disputes, or fights within a community (see Townsend 1978 for a detailed analysis of mobility among a nearby forager group). In the Arafundi region, in other words, social fluidity was even more pronounced than in the Sepik as a whole, with the result that processes of cultural transformation and homogenization proceeded at an even greater velocity.6 The problem this poses for comparative anthropology is the amorphousness it brings to the units being compared. Language boundaries, for example, often figure in the definition of a cultural unit (e.g., Ember and Ember 1994:188), but the Arafundi case vividly underscores the difficulties of incorporating language as a proxy for culture. In the Arafundi region, historical relations worked to generate marked cultural heterogeneities within linguistic boundaries at the same time as they promoted striking cultural homogeneities across them. On the one hand, it is remarkable how much each Lower Arafundi community appears almost to have been a cultural universe-a society or cultural unit-unto itself. Among just four communities, there were marked differences in contact-era densities, settlement types, settlement sizes, and mobility. In the sociological realm, clans in Wamblamas and Imanmeri were aggregated into larger men's-house groups, but in Awim, they were not. Awim and possibly Meakambut used caves as spirit houses and pursued a form of rock art, while Wamblamas and Imanmeri built wooden structures and created bark paintings as elsewhere in the Sepik. Cannibalism was practiced in Wamblamas and Awim, but not in Meakambut. Slit gongs played an important ritual role in Imanmeri but were absent or unimportant elsewhere. Even between the nearest neighboring communities of Imanmeri and Wamblamas, kin terminologies differed in significant ways (Table 1). Some of these differences are plausibly related to environmental differences, in particular access to sago swamps and fish as opposed to game and dry-land rainforest, but history and location were probably at least as important. On the other hand, major elements of Arafundi culture appear to have widely overflowed linguistic boundaries. As noted earlier, Arafundi may be related to the Harwai, Hagahai, and Pinai languages in the mountains to the east, and genetic evidence suggests that these three groups may have had their origins in the Sepik lowlands (Jenkins 1987:418). It is therefore likely that they share a common ancestry with some Arafundi communities and that some of these ancestors moved north from the Sepik into the Arafundi valley, with others moving further northeast into what is now Harwai, Hagahai, and Pinai territory. This scenario is consonant with the remarkable similarities in material, ritual, and social life that Telban observed among these three groups in the 1980s and in Meakambut in the 1990s. Again, some of these similarities are doubtless attributable to environmental commonalities, but it is difficult to avoid a conclusion that common ancestry also played an important role. The point that neither cultures nor languages migrate as hermetically sealed wholes, and that cultural and linguistic traits all flow with a considerable degree of independence from one another, has been made before (for the Sepik, see, e.g.,</page><page sequence="21">THE PEOPLE OF THE LOWER ARAFUNDI 113 Roscoe 1994; Welsch, Terrell, and Nadolski 1992). Immigrant kin groups do not transmit their languages and cultures to their hosts whole, nor do they completely jettison them on arrival. Rather, some elements of immigrant language and culture are incorporated (mothers probably play a particularly important part in transmitting their natal language and culture to the next generation); others modify or are modified by the host language and culture; and yet others simply disappear. The Arafundi case seems to be a particularly stark instance of the consequences of such processes. As such, it underscores the difficulties for comparative analysis of relying solely or even primarily on linguistic boundaries to identify universes and random samples of "cultural units," and it urges the importance of making explicit the criteria being used to define what is being compared.

Imboin, located on the Arafundi River at the base of the mountain wall, occupies an anomalous position between upland and Lowland Arafundi villages. The settlement formed after contact, but its provenance is unclear. One patrol officer believed its members had been driven from the mountains to the south around 1950 (KRW 1962:n.p.). Haberland (1966:40), though, reported that a "few years" previous to his visits in the early 1960s, they had lived some distance to the east, in a village called Kanamun. Both sources may be right. Imboin people told Telban that they came from three different places: the Lower Arafundi settlement of Awim; the Upland Arafundi settlement of Nemata/Tungum to the south; and Kanjimei (Kansimei), a non-Arafundi village fourteen kilometers to the northeast. According to Williams (1995:1), members of the upland village of Pundugum also had immigrated to Imboin. The Imboin people claim that their language is a hybrid from these ancestral settlements. Certainly, there are similarities between their language and that of other Lower Arafundi villages, though on the basis of a very brief visit Palmer and his team (Palmer, Mankins, and Mankins 2001:n.p.) considered that it differed from that of Awim and was related to upland communities such as Nemata/Tungum. Given these linguistic complexities, and because it was a postcontact formation, it seems unwise to include Imboin as a Lowland Arafundi settlement. 3. Telban observed the latter form in Imboin. If the house was attacked, people cut the vines holding the fireplace and escaped through the hole in the floor under cover of the fire's smoke. 4. Sources for these estimates are Amboin and Angoram Patrol Office census registers for 1950, 1954, 1957, 1959, and 1961. Census-register data from the Middle and Lower Sepik indicate that, under the impact of early colonial contact, Sepik population levels suffered greatly from disease, disruptions of the traditional marriage patterns, and other influences, and that contact-era population levels generally were not regained until at least the mid-1950s (Roscoe n.d.). Estimates of Arafundi populations in the mid-1950s are therefore the best available approximations of contact-era populations. Analysis of Middle and Lower Sepik data sets also confirms that the initial patrol-office censuses usually missed significant numbers of residents, so allowance must also be made for undercounts in the early years of censusing.</page><page sequence="22">114 ETHNOLOGY Angerat (Wandukumbay): Patrol-office census registers give the following total populations: 25 (1957), 42 (1959), 42 (1961). In the early 1960s, Haberland (1966:39) noted it had "some 50 inhabitants." Awim (Mungkumbay): Total census-register populations are: 41 (1957), 39 (1959), and 44 (1961); Haberland (1966:39) states it had "some 10 houses with fewer than 50 people." Imanmeri: Census registers yield: 114 (1950), 163 (1954), 184 (1957), 202 (1959), and 216 (1961); Haberland (1966:39) has it as "about 300 people," though this might reflect some immigration from Wamblamas as this settlement group split up. Meakambut: No census registers exist, but patrol-office tallies through the 1960s give: c. 20 (1965), 40 (early 1967), 36 (late 1967), and 34 (1968) after eight people had died of what appeared to be influenza (ABN 1965:7, 1966a:8, 1967a:5, 1969:4). A 1967 estimate that there were about 100 Meakambut seems exaggerated and was later dismissed by the patrol office (ABN 2-67/68, cited in ABN 1969:4). Wamblamas: Following contact, the Wamblamas community split between Wamblamas and Yamandim settlements. Census register totals for these two settlements give 104 (1957), 131 (1959), and 184 (1961); Haberland (1966:39) states it had "about 150" residents. 5. Cannibalism was also practiced in Imboin: human flesh was consumed with a special variety of domesticated sago, and afterwards people defecated at a spot apart from their usual toilet. 6. The formation of the postcontact settlement of Imboin (see note 2 above) provides a plausible model of how these precontact cultural dynamics likely proceeded. BIBLIOGRAPHY ABN. 1962.
