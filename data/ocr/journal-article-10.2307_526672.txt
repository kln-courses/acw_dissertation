<plain_text><page sequence="1">Votive Objects and Obj ects of Votive Significance from Great Walsingham By JEAN BAGNALL SMITH INTRODUCTION n recent years, enough objects of a religious or votive nature have been found to suggest that there was a temple in one particular area of the Roman settlement of Great Walsingham with Wighton, in north central Norfolk.1 These include some important figurines, amongst them three quite different Mercury figures, two goats, one of them very well modelled, and three cocks. There is a portrait bust of Minerva and another of a three-homed deity, masks of Cupid, and representations of satyrs. Nearby, in separate contexts, were discovered a figure of Minerva and a mount in the form of a head of Jupiter. The votive material includes three rings with dedicatory inscriptions-to Mercury, and probably to Toutates, and to the Matres Transmarini; there is also a bronze letter 'V' used in a .. .

There are six model objects-a tiny enamelled stand, two wheels from different moulds, a mattock head, an axe, and a spear; there is also a lead coin-mould, perhaps for making 'temple money' and the handle of a trulla. The finds imply polytheistic beliefs. However, the recovery of so many representations of the god Mercury suggests that here, as elsewhere in the Roman North-West, he was the most popular deity; the finds relating to Cupid and satyrs suggest the existence also of a cult to Bacchus. Because of their provenance, items such as the large number of seal-boxes, lids, and bases found on the site that are not normally classed as votive have been included in this article. There is a possibility that these may have been used in the ritual of the vow, thus giving them votive significance. There are also rings with depictions of Mercury, Mars, Neptune, Ceres, and Jupiter's fulmen, and rings and bracelets with snake head terminals: these may well have been votive offerings. More than two hundred brooches have been recovered from the Walsingham/Wighton settlement area, many of them of uncommon types, some of them imported and an unusually high proportion essentially complete. The brooches are clearly significant because of the quantity found and because of their condition. However, they have not been included in the catalogue below, as they have already been studied by Don Mackreth and will be published at a later date. Only the three Mercury figurines and the three inscribed rings have been fully published before,2 but many of the objects described below have been included in a brief report.3 Norfolk has been a popular hunting-ground in recent years for metal detectorists. Few archaeologists can be happy that metal artefacts are extracted from the ground without a record of their exact context and divorced from all that lay buried around them. Nevertheless, comparatively little major excavation has taken place in the county recently and the finds of responsible detectorists have, in fact, added considerably to current knowledge of Roman Norfolk.4 Metal detection at Great Walsingham, by a dedicated detector, has revealed an astonishing amount of useful material, providing important information about religious practice and cult in Roman Britain. All the finds catalogued and photographed or drawn below were found by Mr Dave Fox, who has permission to detect in the Walsingham/Wighton area. He works closely with the Castle Museum, Norwich and the Norfolk SMR at Gressenhall, bringing artefacts to be identified and recorded, and carefully and methodically charting every find. He and his wife have generously allowed unlimited access to his collection. All the objects in the catalogue are metal; those made from copper alloy have all been described as bronze. None of them has been scientifically analysed. Not discussed is the huge quantity of pottery of second- through to fourth-century date which has been collected on the Walsingham/Wighton site: some is likely to derive from containers for offerings of food and drink, or from vessels associated with ritual consumption. Nor is there more than general reference to the collection of over six thousand Roman coins of second- to fourth-century date, many of which are probably votive. The foundations of a temple building have not yet been recognised, although large quantities of tile have been found; it would probably have been constructed of mortared flint and brick/tile as elsewhere on-or close to-the Chalk in Britain. The exact position of the temple is not known and, because this is an area of archaeological sensitivity, NG references have not been given. THE LANDSCAPE AND SETTING The Walsingham/Wighton Roman settlement site lies several miles north-east of Fakenham in rural north-central Norfolk, to the east of the River Stiffkey, where it is joined by a subsidiary 2 (1) Frere 1988, 456 and pl.

Where known, the context of the find has been given. ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES 1. Mercury. Height: 15.7 cm. Width at elbows: 5.6 cm. Bronze, solid cast. Condition good, but lacking attribute in left hand. Context 29. Norwich Castle Museum (379.985.1).11 (PL. I) This male figure stands facing forwards, legs slightly apart, right foot in front of left. The arms hang down, held out slightly from the sides of the body. The figure is naked except for a round petasos surmounted by small, curving wings, which point upwards; the right hand grasps the neck of a small, pointed purse and the empty hole made by the encircling fingers and thumb of the left hand indicates that it once held a caduceus. Upward-pointing wings can be seen on both the inside and the outside of the ankles. Were it not for the incised lines separating the toes, the wings might be taken for the upper edges of small, soft boots. The short fringe of hair below the petasos is shown at the front and sides by short curves and cross-hatching. The head is large for the body, and is bent forward a little. The features are somewhat 'bunched together' in the centre of the face: the eyes protrude, with eyeballs turned upwards so that iris and pupil lie at the top of the eye; strongly arched brows curve to meet the short, wedge-shaped nose; the corners of the mouth turn down above a deep chin. The ears are small and round. Below the bull-like neck and burly shoulders, the muscles of the chest and upper arms are heavily developed. The genitals are small; two little crescents mark the nipples. The right leg is slightly flexed and the foot flat; the left leg is lifted slightly behind the figure; there are possible traces of solder on the soles of the feet which, emphasised by the sturdy legs, seem disproport- ionately small. The expression and general bearing of this figure were perhaps intended to inspire awe. The interpretation is clearly not classical and the patterned treatment of the hair is typical of Romano-British work. Although the proportions have not been fully understood, it is a fine example of native craftsmanship. No close parallel has been found. The nearest in physical appearance, perhaps, is a figure from Carnuntum which, like most figures of Mercury with a winged petasos, wears a chlamys or cloak over the left shoulder.12 Another Mercury with petasos but no chlamys was found by Wheeler during excavation of the amphitheatre at Caerleon, but the two figures have otherwise little in common.13 The highly individual figure that we have here is a very good example of how Romano-British craftsmen borrowed from the classical to express new forms and interpretations which, nevertheless, retain a clearly native character. The legs of this figure were seen sticking up out of the soil, between fifteen and twenty metres to the north of where, five years apart, two gold coins were found. Both are believed to have been solidi, one of Arcadius and the other of Honorius, confirming that there was activity at this part of the site at the very end of the fourth century. Mercury figure No. 2 was found nearby, also a model axe, No. 26, below. 2. Mercury. Height: 9.7 cm. Width: 4.2 cm. Bronze, cast. Condition reasonably good, apart from fragments missing from the pubic area and from the left arm and leg. Lacks what was probably a caduceus in the left hand. Context 29. Norwich Castle Museum (379.985.2).14 (PL.

The schematically rendered folds of a somewhat solid-looking chlamys fall from the left shoulder and behind the upper arm; they loop between the arm and the body and over the inside of the left elbow, before flying out stiffly to the side. A small 'cottage loaf' purse rests on the palm of the right hand and there are wings on both the inside and the outside of the rather worn feet. The face is framed by the hair, shown by short, straight, lines. Between the wings on top of the head there is a triangle filled with incised cross-hatching, probably indicating hair but possibly a diadem, aligned on the forehead. Heavy eyebrows meet the flattened, wedge-shaped nose; the eyes are raised pointed ovals. The mouth turns down slightly, yet the face is curiously expressionless. The neck is broad and the muscles of the shoulders heavy. Deep grooves emphasise the body musculature, particularly on the back and the calves. The figure is, perhaps, in the act of alighting on uneven ground; the ball of the right foot has marks, probably from solder; the foot of the flexed left leg, which has three lines scored across the sole, has the outside held higher than the inside. The stiffness and schematic rendering of the folds of the cloak and the over-emphasised musculature of the body and limbs suggest Romano-British workmanship; nevertheless the proportions of the figure are well understood and movement is subtly indicated. Again, no obvious parallels have been found. It shares some characteristics with the type shown in Lindgren's fig. 115 and others with a figure of Mercury from Brixton Deverill, near Cold Kitchen Hill in Wiltshire.16 It was found near Mercury figure No. 1. 3. Mercury. Height 12.2 cm. Bronze, cast. Condition good, apart from its missing left arm which broke off at the shoulder and was filed smooth in antiquity. The ancient break has the same patina as the rest of the figure. Context 31. Norwich Castle Museum. NCM 1989.44.17 (PL. IIB) This elegant figure of Mercury stands bare-headed and completely nude, with two rounded wings springing directly from the hair. There is no sign of a chlamys on the shoulder of the missing arm; the remaining arm is held out to the figure's half right, with a broad-based money-bag balanced on the open palm. Beneath it, the fingers and thumb are well-marked. There are no wings on the feet. The head is turned slightly to the figure's right and is tilted downwards. The hair waves from a single point at the back of the top of the head. A double row of curls surrounds the face, with a single row across the back of the head. Under bushy eyebrows, the oval eyes are well-shaped, and below the large nose the mouth is straight and the chin pointed; the expression, nevertheless, is kindly. In profile, the forehead continues in one line to the end of the nose. The shapely body leans to its left from the waist, its physique and anatomy skilfully portrayed. Penis and scrotum are small and two rows of short curves above represent pubic hair. The right leg is straight and two large spots of solder under the ball and heel of the foot show that the figure was designed to stand flat on this foot. The left leg is flexed, with the foot turned outwards. Solder under its ball and toes indicate where it was attached, perhaps to a 'rock', in antiquity. The toes are clumsily executed for a figure of this quality, portrayed by an extra strip of metal, with incised lines for the toes, laid over the ends of the feet (the second toe on the right foot is missing). Perhaps this was a way of strengthening the beautifully modelled but delicate feet. A figurine of Mercury now in the British Museum, which was found in the River Thames at London, resembles this example, except that it wears a chlamys.18 The Walsingham figurine has much in common with the superb Mercury figure found near the boundary of the temenos at Gosbecks, near Colchester.19 Another figurine, very similar but carrying a pointed purse, was found at Orbe, in Switzerland.20 Despite slight differences in their portrayal, these figures all belong stylistically to a group which Stephanie Boucher associated with the colossal statue produced by the Neronian sculptor, Zenodoros, for the Arverni.21 Figures in this group are characterised by wings springing directly from the hair, the bent right arm holding out a purse on an open palm, and wingless feet. 15 Lindgren 1980, 40, fig. 1. 16 Henig 1997, 143-5. 17 Frere 1988, 456 and pl.

The front of this female figurine, including the head, is badly worn and corroded. Nevertheless, it is still possible to discern her aegis with the head of Medusa on her chest. The other remaining attribute is a helmet, which appears to be of uncrested, Corinthian type. She lacks the right arm from above the elbow, also the left forearm: the spear and shield she is likely to have held are, therefore, not present. Context 25. Found at Wighton Camp. (PL. IIC) The deity faces forwards, her head turned half right. Her left arm is raised to the level of her shoulder with the stump of the forearm rotated. The stump of the right arm hangs downwards. In spite of the less usual helmet and the absence of hand-held attributes, this figure is readily identified as the goddess Minerva, from her aegis and the head of Medusa on her chest, and from her characteristic pose. Minerva was invariably portrayed as a fully clothed, female warrior; however, she was worshipped not only as goddess of warfare but also as the deity concerned with wisdom, health, and the arts and crafts. Many of the known examples are believed to derive, ultimately, from the lost fifth-century statue of Athene Parthenos, by Phidias. Most depictions of Minerva show her with a crested, Corinthian helmet. A similar type of helmet to the one worn by this figure may be seen on a bronze bust of Minerva from Keep Hill, High Wycombe, now in the British Museum.22 A figurine from the temple at Lamyatt Beacon, Bruton, in Somerset is depicted with similar dress and pose. 3 ANTHROPOMORPHIC BUSTS AND MASKS 5. Minerva bust. Height: 4.4 cm. Width: 2.3 cm. Weight: 32.8 g. Bronze, solid cast. In somewhat worn condition; however, the bust is topped by a crested helmet and a Medusa's head is visible on the chest. Context 546. (PL. IIIC) A small bust, probably an applique from a box or vessel. The facial features are only schematically represented by two punched dots for the eyes and three short lines, one above the other, for nose, mouth, and chin. The Medusa's head on her aegis has been treated in a similar way. The back of the bust is flat, but the crest of the helmet projects nearly half a centimetre behind it. There are two very similar busts from the temple site at Woodeaton, in Oxfordshire, one of which still has the remains of an iron blade in situ inside its pedestal;24 these busts form handles for razors25 or, more probably, for spatulae with which either to spread wax on to wooden writing-tablets26 or to erase unwanted writing.27 A small bust forming a handle from London, on which the detail was more carefully rendered, is now in the Museum of London;28 another was found at Stonea, in Cambridgeshire.29 Also discovered at Stonea, are two somewhat debased small busts rather than knife handles that probably represent Minerva,30 a well-made and stylistically different bust of the same deity, and a fragment of a Corinthian helmet.31 6. Bust of three-horned deity. Height: 4.9 cm. Width at 'shoulders': 4.5 cm. Weight: 30.8 g. Bronze. The head is hollow cast; the three horns and the two, but originally three, pointed horizontal prongs at shoulder level are solid. In good condition, but lacking the knob of the third horn and the forward-pointing prong. Context 218. (PL.

Close inspection reveals a shallow line that curves downwards from just above each ear until it is level with the corners of the mouth, before curving up to the sides of the nose. Below this line, the hair of a beard is indicated by short, finely incised lines on the lower cheeks and by little dots on the chin and mid-cheek. Small concave oval discs for ears are attached rather low on the sides of the head, as if an afterthought. Round the broad neck and integral with the bust is a torc with knobbed terminals. There are no obvious signs of solder on the back. Although at first sight the headgear is reminiscent of a jester's cap, the torc round the neck of this bust refutes a medieval date. Torcs were produced in Europe in the later Bronze Age, but are associated partic- ularly with the Iron Age, when high-quality metalwork was an important way of displaying status. Iron Age warriors wore torcs even when going naked into battle: the literary evidence is illustrated by the famous marble statue of the Dying Gaul in the Museo Capitolino in Rome. There is no shortage of archaeological evidence in Iron Age Europe from after the Roman conquest as well as from before it: two particularly interesting examples from Gaul are the first-century B.C. limestone pillar statue from Euffigneix, Haute Marne, which has a boar carved in low relief on its body,33 and the bronze, cross-legged figure with hooves from Bouray, dating probably to the first century A.D.34 A first-century A.D. wooden carving from Source-de-la-Roche is a reminder that torcs were worn by women as well as by men.35 Numerous Celtic coins, identified recently as two dispersed hoards, have been found at Walsingham/Wighton: these indicate that there was activity in the area in the Late Iron Age.36 Because the bust was found with a metal-detector, it cannot be dated with certainty, but it belongs probably to the earlier rather than the later Romano-British period. The torc is known to have had powerful religious connotations,37 and it is clear that many of the images portrayed wearing them were deities. This is confirmed by the occurrence of torcs on figures which can be identified with Roman gods, for instance, in a cult group modelled in the round from Verulamium,38 in another from Frankfurt a.M.- Heddernheim and on a figure from Mathay, in France.39 These examples are all accompanied by attributes and, unquestionably, represent Mercury. An interesting find from Caister St Edmund is a bronze plaque decorated with a depiction of Mercury in relief. When found, a snake-head ring, worn as a torc, was in place at the neck of the figure, cemented in position by corrosion products and embedded in a mass of charcoal and soil.40 The head of man or beast was of unique importance in the Iron Age: it contained the essential being and could, even on its own, represent a whole person or animal.41 There are many examples from Britain of cast bronze, male, human, or animal heads; they appear often to have been fittings on buckets or cauldrons, some of which were probably imported from Gaul.42 The anthropomorphic mounts decorating the handles of the bronze-bound iron buckets found in a burial at Baldock each wear a cap with two drooping knobbed horns.43 Others from a bucket from Aylesford have a cap or helmet from which a central flat strip rises and branches to form a crescentic head-dress with knobbed terminals.44 There is ample evidence of the cult of horned gods in continental Europe and the British Isles, and Ross has drawn attention to its proto-Iron Age and Bronze Age ancestry.45 She discusses the widely significant cult in Iron Age Europe of an antlered deity who is, in fact, usually portrayed wearing a torc.46 The stag and other 32 Cunliffe 1994, 361.

Sometimes a deity may be depicted as an animal or with animal characteristics: theriomorphism is discussed by Green.47 Bulls' heads with knobbed horns appear to be a feature of the Iron Age on, for instance, the firedogs from Baldock,48 Welwyn,49 and Ham Hill in Somerset.50 Knobbed horns are also found on anthropoid images: a little bust with two knobbed horns, considered by Henig to represent Mercury, was discovered at Uley, where there was a cult of this god.51 Another decorates the Gundestrup cauldron.52 A mask of Iron Age type, with two knobbed horns from Richborough in Kent53 resembles another with three knobbed horns from Cologne.54 The number three is known to have had religious and magical significance in Iron Age Europe; triplism was believed to imply the increased power of the image.55 Three horns are seen again on a remarkable first-century A.D. head-dress of gold that was discovered in Cork, only here they are long and cone-shaped.56 However, three horns are a feature associated more frequently with animals, particularly with bulls, and are usually found without knobs. Examples from Britain include the bull which decorates the Hercules/Commodus sceptre from Willingham Fen in Cambridgeshire,57 the bronze plaque with a mask of a three-horned bull from Cookham, in Berkshire,58 and the bull with the busts of three goddesses on its back found at Maiden Castle, Dorset.59 This last has aspects in common with several three-horned bulls recorded from Gaul60 where, in the North-East, there appears to have been a cult of a three-horned bull-god.61 Who does this bust represent? Henig has suggested that it may, in fact, like the little bust from Uley, be intended to represent Mercury, as the latter's was the main cult at Walsingham62 and representations of Mercury with horns rather than wings are known. It has a beard, and although standard Roman depictions of Mercury are never bearded, a stone statue of a bearded Mercury on which there was an inscription in Celtic was found at the entrance to the potteries at Lezoux.63 As Webster has pointed out, while elements of Roman religious practice might be added, native elements were not likely to be dropped, for fear of causing offence64 and the conflation of British with Roman ideas is very complex. Identification with Mercury has to be a possibility. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the woodland aspect of the Cupid and satyr finds discussed below and the Iron Age influence exhibited by many objects in the Fox Collection, identification with a native horned god seems the most likely answer. 7.

A double row of fat and rounded curls frames the face; the full moustache and beard are portrayed in the same way. From under lowered brows, the eyes glare; one is well defined, with a clear pupil, the other less so. 47 Green 1977. 48 Stead and Rigby 1986, fig. 24. 49 Brailsford 1975, 90 and pls 132-7. 50 Haverfield 1906, 296, fig. 63.12. 51 Henig 1993, 98, fig. 85, no. 2. 52 Klindt-Jensen 1961, fig. 8. 53 Bushe-Fox 1949, pl.

This is the face of a mature man. There are no attributes to confirm the identity, but the luxuriant, curly hair and beard are characteristic of Capitoline Jupiter. Two model wheels and a silver ring incised with Jupiter's fulmen were found close by, see Nos 22 and 23, and 31. In Celtic iconography, the wheel-god is a native Gaulish version of a type of Roman Jupiter.65 A figurine of Jupiter from Auvernier in Switzerland has similar luxuriant hair and beard,66 as does another from Muri near Bern.67 Two heads of Jupiter, almost identical to each other, found separately near Amersham, are thought to have been mounts from a tripod.68 A larger head of Jupiter Taranis, believed to have belonged to a votive image from the shrine, was found together with other votive objects including a wheel, under twenty miles away at Felmingham Hall, Norfolk.69 8.

The back has been partly hollowed out, and in this hollow some lead solder remains. The features are blurred by wear. The hair has a topknot and two 'wings' of curls at the sides. Cupid was the Roman form of the Greek god Eros. Usually portrayed as a winged child, he is sometimes found with his mother Venus and sometimes in the company of satyrs and other followers of Bacchus. In Roman art, Cupid seems for the most part to have been portrayed full length; several examples on gems are described by Henig.70 During the excavation of the temple-site at Caerwent, a bronze finger-ring was found in a layer associated with the construction of the temple, together with many fine objects of second- to third-century date.71 It is decorated with a glass cameo depicting a face that could be the infant Cupid.72 A similar ring with a cameo of green glass was found at Staines.73 A cameo ring with a slightly different portrayal of Cupid-this time part of a ring made entirely of yellow glass-was found during the excavation of Shakenoak villa in Oxfordshire.74 In Switzerland, a little bronze bust of a winged cupid from a samovar handle was found at Avenches,75 and another-without wings, but rising from a leafy frame-comes from Martigny.76 Four other little Cupid busts from Switzerland have been published, two from Augst-each of them rising from a calyx of leaves-one from Studen and another from Baden.77 Three further good parallels have been found in Belgium, at Tongeren, Hainaut N.-O, and Sint Huibrechts-Hern, the first and the third rising from a calyx of leaves; described as 'appliques bachiques' they could probably be interpreted as either infant Bacchi or as Cupids.78 Most of these parallels depict childish faces and appear to be of workmanship of a higher quality than is exhibited in the rather crude little mask from Walsingham. 9. Mask of Cupid. Height: 2.6 cm. Width: 2.6 cm. Weight: 7.3 g. Bronze, hollow cast. In good condition. Context 411. (PL. IVB) Small hollow mount, probably depicting the face of Cupid. This mask is well-made Romano-British work, particularly the stylised top-knot and crisply linear curls framing the round face. The eyes are well-defined, oval, and large.

The nose is straight and broadens at the bottom, above straight, slightly parted lips. At the back, behind the hollow nose, are the remains of the rivet with which it was once attached. This is the face of a boy rather than an infant, and is generally paralleled by No. 8.79 10. Mask of a satyr. Height: 2.1 cm. Width: 1.8 cm. Weight: 3.7 g. Bronze, cast. In good condition. Context 495. (PL. IVD) Small, hollow, low-relief mount depicting the head of a satyr, in profile to the left. The satyr has wavy hair; a roll of hair frames the face-beginning with a top knot and ending with a projection below the back of the head. It is very similar to No. 1 1, below. At the back of the mount, the edges are flattened and smooth. Satyrs were mythical beings, believed to haunt field, wood, and stream and usually represented by artists as young men with equine ears and tails. They were rustic male members of the thiasos of the god, Bacchus, whose cult was linked with that of Faunus, attested in literature as an ancient deity from Latium in Italy. Remarkable evidence of a cult of Faunus was discovered at Thetford, on the Norfolk-Suffolk border. The very fine goldwork found there included a handsome gold buckle in two parts, formed of a loop or bow with confronted horses' heads, and a rectangular plate decorated with a young dancing satyr, in relief.80 Other full-length satyrs can be seen as part of the Bacchic thiasos so vividly illustrated on the great silver dish from Mildenhall.81 They are often depicted on intaglios.82 A satyr and small Cupid playing are engraved on a nicolo intaglio set in a gold finger-ring with a filigree hoop of beaded wire, found not far from the south-west corner of the town wall at Silchester; the satyr appears to be being tugged along by the Cupid, who is holding him by the hand.83 At Avenches in Switzerland, a vessel was discovered with escutcheons below the rings for the handles, each depicting the mask of a rascally-looking satyr.84 An applique bust of a satyr wearing his nebris from Tarrant Hinton in Dorset is clearly of British workmanship, as shown by the stylisation and the heavily patterned texture of the hair.85 An intaglio from Colchester shows a youthful satyr mask and another found at Bartlow, Cambs., depicts masks of a satyr and maenad, placed back to back.86 A third intaglio engraved with a satyr head is recorded from Wroxeter. Hutchinson has published the evidence for the Bacchic cult in Britain87 and Roscher is a useful resource.88 11. Leaf-shaped pendant decorated with the head of a satyr. Length: 4.4 cm. Width: 2.3 cm. Raised oval: 0.9 x 1.1 cm. Weight: 3.5 g. Silver. Lacking the upper end of the pendant. Condition of the remaining part, good. Context 573. (PL. IVC) The lower half of a leaf-shaped pendant, terminating in a knob. Immediately below the break, in the centre of the pendant, there is an oval roundel which encircles the head of a satyr, raised in low relief. The satyr faces right, but is otherwise very similar to the last example. This is an interesting and attractive piece of work; the roundel may have been adapted from an impression of an engraved gem, here intended to resemble a cameo. 12. Strap fitting with head of satyr. Length of face: 2.5 cm. Width of face: 2.1 cm. Length of loop: 2 cm. Weight: 8.1 g. Bronze, cast. The loop behind is broken, but the condition is otherwise good. Context 551. (PL. IVE) Looped fitting for a leather strap, the front of which is formed by the low-relief, hollow head of a satyr, in profile, facing left. The satyr has a plump, bold face framed by a roll of hair, a turned-up nose and a mischievous expression. The rectangular loop behind, intended for the strap, is broken at one end. 79 Esp.

Goat. Height 5.1 cm. Length 5.5 cm. Weight: 103.75 g. Bronze. Heavy, solid cast. In very good condition, but lacking the bottom of the right leg. Context 408. (PL. VA) A very fine, naturalistically modelled goat, possibly part of a larger group, showing remarkably clear details of horns, beard, and fleece of fat curls. The head is turned slightly to the right, and down to the left. The punched holes for the pupils are not level, nor are the ears. The mouth is slightly open and the short tail curls upwards. Three other handsome models of goats from Britain spring to mind; the closest parallel being one from Caerleon.89 Another, from London, is in the British Museum.90 An attractive model of a ram, also probably part of a larger group, was recently found with a metal-detector while the Fenny Stratford by-pass was being constructed. The fleece of this animal was indicated in stylistic fashion by punched annular and penannular rings, and it carries two panniers-interpreted as the purses of Mercury-on its back.91 A fine ram with a thick curly fleece, long tail, and volute horns was found at Cologne and a handsome goat, with erect horns and hair shown in wavy clumps, at an unknown findspot in Germany.92 The ram or goat and also the cock were animals associated with Mercury and are sometimes depicted with him. 14. Goat. Height: 2.2 cm. Length: 2.9 cm. Weight: 21 g. Bronze, cast. In good condition. Context 591. (PL. VB) Small model of a goat. The shape is not fully in the round and is simple and fairly crude; the surface is undecorated. However, the outline of backward-pointing horns is discernible, also probably a beard rather than a lower jaw. The tail is short and turns down. The legs are short as well: the front ones are joined together, the back ones are separate, with the right leg in front of the left. No parallels have so far been found. 15. Cock. Height: 5.9 cm. Weight: 48.9 g. Bronze. Cast. In good condition but lacking-probably never possessing-any feet. Context 451. (PL. VC) This is a particularly naturalistic model, revealing close observation of the behaviour of this bird. The head, on its long neck, is turned half right and lifted loftily and enquiringly. Details of the plumage are indicated by incisions, the curves of the tail feathers by semicircles with some hatching and the wings by rounded chevrons and more hatching. There are hatched lines on the neck and the comb, and wattles are shown by incised lines and nicks. The smith appears to have had a sense of humour, because the left eye is round and the right oval; and the chevrons indicating the gaiters face upwards on the left side, and downwards on the right. There are no feet and the lower ends of the legs are joined by a short crossbar where, presumably, the model was once attached to something else. Models of cocks are frequently discovered, but nothing very like this bird has so far been found. The cock is recognised as one of the attributes of the god Mercury and, like the ram or goat, often formed part of a group with a figurine of this deity.93 16. Cock. Height: 2.5 cm. Bronze, cast. The surface of the metal is corroded and the condition only fair. (PL. VD) This small model of a cock, probably a finial, stands upright on a little, round stand; the head is raised and turned slightly to the left; the beak is open, the tail held aloft; the legs merge to join the stand. The comb and wattles are discernible but worn. There is slight roughness under the stand where the bird was once attached. 17. Cock. Height: 1.8 cm. Length: 2 cm. Bronze, cast. The condition is reasonably good. Context 559. (PL. VE) This small model of a cock has no feet but hunches into a sub-square stand, on which it stands unaided. The head is turned to its left and has sunk into the neck. The feathers of the tail, which are held aloft, divide in two; rudimentary feather markings can be seen. The beak is slightly open. No similar cock has been found. 89 Green 1978, 26, pl. XC. 90 Green 1983, 224 and pl. XX, e. 91 Hunn, Lawson and Parkhouse 1995, 53-5. 92 Menzel 1986, pl.

Found at Wighton, Context 211. Inscribed between two pairs of vertical lines on the flat bezel is 'MER' for 'Mer(curio)'.94 (FIG. 3, No. 1). Other rings inscribed 'MER' or 'DEO MER' have been found see RIB 2422.20; 29; and 30, also the report of the Stonea Grange excavation.95 The ?old ring given to Mercury at Uley is not comparable since it appears to have been returned stolen property. 6 A similar hexagonal ring (Context 646) has a large flat plain rectangular bezel with a pair of vertical lines on either side: this may well have been left blank for an inscription.97 Presumably the name of the desired deity would have been inscribed to order. 19. Ring inscribed 'TOT'. Diameter: 2 cm. Width: 1.3 cm. Silver, cast. D-shaped. In good condition. Context 537.98 (PL. VIIA) Narrow, D-section, D-shaped hoop. This expands at the slightly raised, flat, rectangular bezel on which are inscribed the letters 'TOT', within a rectangular inscribed border; the latter is hatched along its upper and lower edges. This is the sixth ring from Britain inscribed 'TOT'.99 The Celtic deity Toutatis, identified with Mars, is attested by two dedications.100 Rings inscribed 'TOT' are discussed by Henig and Ogden.10l 20. Ring with two-line inscription 'MATRIBV/S * I * R', 'For the Mothers...' Diameter: 2.8 cm. Width: 1.4 cm. Silver, cast. Condition good. Context 458.102 (FIG. 3, No. 2) Hassall and Tomlin believed that the 'S' was probably the last letter of the first line and that the 'I.R' was more likely to have been an epithet of the Matres than the abbreviated name of the dedicator. They suggest that the 'I' could be read as a 'T'-for 'TR(ANSMARINIS)'. Three rings dedicated to the Matres are known103 and there are six instances of 'Transmarinis' used as an epithet of the Matres in Britain.104 Alternative readings by Sauer would take the letters 'I .R' either as abbreviations for two epithets of the Matres or for the name of the dedicator. VOTIVE LETTER 21. A Letter 'V'. Height: 4.6 cm. Width: 1.8 cm. Weight: 9.3 g. Bronze. Damaged at the base. Context 30. (PL. VIA) This appears to be a narrow letter 'V', formed of curving rather than straight strokes. The upper surfaces are flat, with widely bevelled edges. At the base of the right stroke, the edge has splayed outwards in a flat, sub-circular bulge. The stumpy studs with counterplates under the top of each stroke suggest that this letter was designed for use on leather. Letters of sheet bronze with tiny holes for suspension have been found on many temple sites, for example Lydney, Woodeaton, and both the Hockwold temples. At Woodeaton, most of the letters that make up the dedication 'MARTI' were found during excavation, on what had been a gravel surface just outside the north ambulatory wall. A complete bronze letter 'V' was found among the many letters discovered at Lydney.105 Another, retaining two nails, was discovered on the site of the Union House, Colchester.106 There are many 94 Hassall and Tomlin 1994, 306, no. 39 and pl.

There is also the inscription 'VSLM', used when the prayers of a devotee had been answered, and he was fulfilling his vow. The letter 'V' from Walsingham appears to have been applied to a leather backing. A smaller example with studs on the back was found at Kidlington, in Oxfordshire in 1949.107 MODEL OBJECTS 22. Model wheel of flat section with six plain straight spokes. Diameter: 3.5 cm. Weight: 5.7 g. Bronze. Condition good. Context 30. (PL. VID) The felloe of the wheel is decorated with an inner ring of short transverse lines. The interior of the spokes has hatched transverse lines also. In the centre of the wheel is the projecting nave, formed by a hexagonal rivet. The wheel is well known to have been a very ancient symbol, adopted by many different cults. In Celtic iconography, it often accompanied the god, known as Taranis, who is identified with Jupiter. Green has published widely on its significance in the Celtic world.108 There are no clues as to whether it was ever attached to anything. Both this model and No. 23, below, are copies of functional, rather than decorative wheels. The nearest in appearance is a wheel from Icklingham. 109 At Wanborough in Surrey, where five priestly head-dresses were found, two were surmounted by a five-spoke wheel and one by a wheel with four spokes.'10 23. Model wheel of flat section with six plain tapering spokes. Diameter: 2.5 cm. Weight: 2.45 g. Bronze. Condition good. (PL. VIE) This is a smaller flat wheel, with no surface decoration and with six not completely even spokes, whose sides splay. There is a hole through the flat, hexagonal, central nave and another in the felloe, immediately beyond where it is joined by one of the spokes. 24. Model mattock. Length of blade from one end to the other: 5 cm. The greatest width is 2 cm. The depth, at the deeper end: 1.8 cm. Lead. In quite good condition. Context 573.111 (PL. VIB) The blade is sturdy and wedge-shaped. There is no socket for a handle, but a short, oval projection under the centre has a shallow, transverse recess, suggestive of a place of attachment. Its size-small, but not miniature-and the metal that it is made of, are less usual in a model object, but a small lead mattock would be unsuitable for most practical purposes. Model tools are found on temple sites although less commonly than model weapons.112 The axe/hammer was associated especially with Jupiter. 25. Small spear, possibly a model. Length: 11.6 cm. Width of blade: 1.2 cm. Weight: 13.45 g. Bronze, cast. Condition good. Context 605. (PL. VIC) The shaft, of circular section, is integral with the socketed spearhead. A small prong projects from the distal end.1 3 This spear may have been part of a group assemblage. However, some spears of Republican date and later had a pointed butt, protecting the shaft when it was stuck into the ground and acting as a secondary weapon in the event of damage to the spearhead.114 There is a neat hole pierced in one side of the leaf-shaped blade, perhaps for a bell or bells. This spear is longer than most models, although two long model spears were found at Woodeaton, one of them very crude;1 15 neither of these had a hole in the blade. A small, silver model spear, with a hole punched through the same place on one side of the blade, was found at Uley.116 This had been ritually bent.

In the same hoard, a knobbed, bronze ceremonial spear was discovered, with the remains of a hole each side of the base of its head. 17 A knobbed iron spear with holes similarly placed and one loose iron ring still in situ was found on the temple site at Lowbury Hill.118 26. Small model axe. Length of haft: 3.5 cm. Length of blade: 2.3 cm. Width of blade: 0.8 cm. Weight: 3.65 g. Bronze, cast. The surface of the metal is severely corroded.

The narrow flat blade is decorated on one side only-with two parallel lines across the end and a saltire cross in the centre. The haft is of circular section with a simple double knop at the distal end. 27. Small enamelled model stand. Height: 1.2 cm. Width: 1.4 cm. Depth: 1.4 cm. Bronze, with enamel. Condition fair. Context 573.120 (FIG. 3, No. 4) The stand is almost a cube in plan: the sides are slightly splayed. The top has a roughly square hole in the middle and is very worn with irregular small smudges of enamel on the surface; four flattened knobs are just discernible at the corners. The bottom of the stand is open. The sides are decorated with raised saltire crosses which create shallow fields for alternate pairs of triangles; the top triangles and probably the bottom ones contain decayed red enamel. The decayed enamel in the side triangles alternating with them is greenish. The lower edges of one pair of opposite sides are straight while, at the base of the other pair, a roughly curving 'bite' has been removed, probably not intentionally as this would have spoiled the pattern of the enamel decoration. These stands are frequently found in pairs; their exact function is unknown. The best parallel is a little stand from Market Weighton, E. Yorkshire.121 JEWELLERY (POSSIBLY VOTIVE BECAUSE OF ITS PROVENANCE) 28. Ring with sacred double axe motif. Diameter: 2.15 cm by 1.8 cm. Weight: 4.8 g. Silver. Condition good. (PL. VIIB) Tapering hoop of D-shaped profile, Henig Type 3/5, with an inset silver plaque decorated with a double axe-head motif in low relief, on the flatter, wider front of the hoop. I am grateful to Dr Henig for drawing my attention to two other unpublished rings with a similar motif, found recently in Norfolk, one at Wicklewood (NCM 380.985) and the other at Caistor St Edmund (NCM, Cat. No. M8). 29. Ring with setting depicting Mercury. Graduated hoop, broadening markedly towards the shoulders, from 0.3 cm to 1.7 cm at the widest point of the bezel. Externally it is elliptical, with a width of 2.5 cm and a height of 1.7 cm. Internally the diameter of the ring is oval: 2 cm by 1.6 cm. The oval inset: 1.05 by 1.25 cm. Weight: 9.9 g. Silver. Heavy. Form: Henig type V.122 Second half of second century. Relief. In good condition. (PL. VIIC) The rounded exterior surface is slightly keeled on either side of the bezel, the beginning of a process which will lead to third-century ring types; the bezel is formed by a flat, oval, silver plaque depicting a repousse, standing figure of Mercury within a raised oval frame, which has been set into the curved surface of the front of the ring. The figure faces a little to his right and leans slightly backwards. His weight is on his right leg and his left is extended behind. He holds a money-bag in his right hand and a caduceus in his left.123 The use of a worked metal plaque of silver or gold instead of a gemstone was found over a wide area, although it never became common. A silver ring with a gold plaque depicting a bust of Mercury was found at "117 Gilbert 1978, 176-80, fig. 3, A, fig. 7, A. 18 Atkinson 1916, 47, pl. XIV, no. 8.

In the same paper, Johns described Vulcan on a gold plaque in a silver ring from Lincolnshire.128 Jeffery May has kindly informed me of other rings of this type from Lincolnshire. In describing a silver ring with a finer silver inset plaque, probably of the goddess Roma, found at Wendlebury, in Oxfordshire, Henig writes that this type of setting rather than an intaglio suggests a shift of interest away from practical signets towards rings with amuletic properties.129 All the rings mentioned above, apart from the ring from Holland and the last from Oxfordshire, were found in Eastern Britain. However, this may well be due more to the areas chosen for metal-detection than to their actual distribution. 30. Ring with setting depicting Mercury. Graduated hoop widening considerably towards the shoulders from 0.5 cm at the back to 1.5 cm at the widest part of the bezel. Externally the ring is elliptical, with a width of 2.5 cm and a height of 1.5 cm. The internal diameter is 2 cm wide by 1.7 cm front to back. Oval inset: 1.05 by 1.25 cm. Weight: 9.9 g. Silver.

Again the rounded exterior is gently keeled, but in this example has been modified to provide a flat area to take the inset plaque. The low-relief, standing figure of Mercury is as No. 29, but the raised oval frame that surrounds it is more pronounced. This ring is also very like the last, except that the front of the ring is not as wide and is flat rather than rounded. The weight of the two rings is the same. For comparanda see No. 29. 31. Ring with incised thunderbolt (fulmen). Diameter: 1.95 by 1.6 cm. Width of bezel: 0.5 cm. Length of bezel: 2 cm. Hoop graduates to 0.3 cm at the back. Weight: 3.15 g. Silver. Form: Henig type Xb (for the shoulders) / IX (because it is externally octagonal). Probably third century. Engraved. In good condition. Context 573. (FIG. 3, No. 5) Small D-shaped finger-ring with eight flattened external facets of irregular length, the longest forming the rectangular bezel area. The bezel is marked at each end by a pair of incised lines which form a low step above the adjoining facet. Two groups of opposed curving lines have been crudely incised within the rectangle. These could well represent flashes from the thunderbolt that is one of the major attributes of Jupiter.

The swan is here sitting, with wings outstretched above, between the legs of Leda, who reclines towards the left on a rock. The bird appears to be kissing her. This motif apparently originated as early as the fourth century B.C.,132 and was quite common on Roman gems.133 There are some in the principal national gem collect- ions.134 The swan was Jupiter in disguise and Leda was, on occasion, identified with Nemesis.135 The moulded oval rises 1.5 mm from the surface of the hoop. 124 Henig and Brown 1979, 201-2, fig. 1 and pl. 1. 125 Marshall 1907 (reprinted 1968), no. 258. 126 Henkel 1913, no. 384. 127 Henig 1974, no. 763. 128 Johns 1991, 55-64, nos 6 and 18. 129 Henig 1990, 166-7. 130 Henig 1974, nos 415-16. 131 Johns 1997b, 41, 109, no. 302. 132 Boardman 1970, 223 and pl. 728 (gold ring). 133 Henig 1974, no. 478. 134 Maaskant-Kleibrink 1978, no. 351. 135 See Grimal 1986, 254-5.</page><page sequence="17">VOTIVE OBJECTS FROM GREAT WALSINGHAM 37 33. Gem-ring with Ceres in intaglio. Diameter: 1.8 by 1.5 cm. Oval: 0.65 by 0.8 cm. Weight: 5.1 g. Silver ring. Form: Henig type III/V. Mid-second century. Set with cornelian. In good condition. Context either 385 or 457. (PL. VlIG) The graduated hoop of this finger-ring has a rounded exterior surface, the wider front of which is set with a flat oval cornelian of tawny-red colour, which depicts Ceres in intaglio facing to the viewer's left on the actual gem. The goddess holds two corn-ears and an offering dish. There is no ant. Depictions of Ceres are frequently found on signet rings: she would have been important to people whose life and livelihood were concerned with farming and the countryside. Henig has published many examples of similar engraved gemstones.136 However, we are able to attribute this ring to an actual workshop, as it closely resembles rings described in Johns' publication of the gems from Roman Snettisham, where the latest coin found is dated A.D. 155.137 It was perhaps engraved by 'Engraver C', whose technique of almost always engraving one arm and the neck in one straight line has been identified by Maaskant-Kleibrink. 138 34. Gem-ring with Neptune in intaglio. Diameter: 1.8 by 1.5 cm. Width of front of hoop: 1.5 cm. Width of tapered back of hoop: 0.4 cm. Setting: 0.8 by Icm. Weight: 9.1 g. Bronze hoop, gilded. Form: Henig type XI, set with blue glass, F2. Third century. The surface of the hoop is heavily corroded. Context 383. (PL. VIIH) The wider front of the graduated D-shaped hoop of this finger-ring is set with a bevelled oval of blue glass paste, imitating nicolo, on which Neptune is depicted in intaglio. The figure resembles a statue of Poseidon dating from the fourth century B.C. Viewing the actual gem, Neptune faces to the viewer's left with a trident in his right hand and a drape over his right arm. His left arm is outstretched, and a dolphin rests on his left hand. His straight left leg takes the weight of his body, while his right leg rests on the prow of a ship, indicating his power over all the oceans. The bevelled oval is framed by a band of gilding. However, the touches of gilding remaining on the internal surface indicate that the whole ring was originally gilded, to make it look grander than it really was. This motif has also been noted on a ring from Woodeaton, in Oxfordshire.139 35. Fragment of Gem-ring with Mars in intaglio. Setting: 0.8 by 1.1 cm. Bronze hoop. Form: Henig type XIII, set with nicolo-glass, F2. Mid-/late third century. Lacking back of hoop. Edges of bezel damaged. Context 539. (PL. VIllA) Bezel and everted shoulders only of this ring remain. The slim hoop broadens into an oval from which rises a bevelled oval of blue glass paste, imitating nicolo. The standing figure of Mars is depicted in intaglio, wearing helmet and tunic. On the actual gem, he faces front, but has turned his head to look down at the shield which his left hand supports on the ground. In his right hand, he holds an upright spear. A similar motif can be seen on Henig's No. 86, except that the figure is reversed.140 36. Setting from a ring depicting Mars in intaglio. 1.1 by 1.2 cm. Gold, cast. Oval. In good condition. Context 556. Weight: 3.1g. (PL. VIIIB) On the actual setting the god stands, facing to his left, with head in profile. He has a beard and wears a plumed Corinthian helmet, tunic, cuirass, and boots. His right hand rests on a shield, supported on the ground; his left holds a vertical spear. There are marks possibly from adhesive on the back.

The mouse faces to the viewer's left: its long ears give the animal the appearance of a hare, but accurate strokes would have been difficult when working with a tiny jeweller's wheel.142 Mice, living in holes in the ground, may have been regarded as chthonic. But hares, too, were considered sacred at this time by the British. Both, therefore, could have possessed amuletic properties. Mice occur as subjects on engraved gems; on one, a mouse leaps from a nautilus shell, holding a morsel of food in its paws; on another, a mouse drives a cart pulled by a cock while holding a whip.143 The best parallel for the Walsingham mouse can be seen in the collection from the jeweller's workshop at Snettisham. 44 38. Penannular snake bracelet. Length: c. 17 cm. Weight: 12.1 g. Bronze, sheet metal with incised decoration. Complete, but twisted and distorted; the surface of the metal is worn. Type Bii. Context 372. (FIG. 3, No. 6) The main hoop of the bracelet is of flattish section. At each terminal, the hoop broadens and thickens, to form two confronted snakeheads.145 These are lozenge-shaped, the jaws ending in a point; there is little attempt at three-dimensional portrayal. The decoration on the upper surface is stylised, but clearly-marked and slightly different on each terminal. The eyes are set at the sides of the widest part of the head. Just behind and midway between them, two dots have been punched, one 0.9 cm behind the other; these are joined by an incised line. Two more incised lines run from the further dot to the sides of the head, level with the dot immediately behind the eyes. Between the eyes and the jaw, down the centre of the head, is a strip of XXX-decoration on one terminal and of zigzag decoration on the other, presumably in imitation of scales. The hoop is badly bent and could well have been distorted deliberately. Snake jewellery was popular in the Hellenistic kingdoms and towns like Tarentum from the end of the fourth century B.C., spreading throughout Italy and to all parts of the Roman Empire. This was partly the result of the spread of the Eastern religions, and partly the result of trade and the exchange of artistic ideas. Snakes are adjuncts of the Greek deities Aesculapius and Hygeia, protectors of health. They accompany Minerva, Isis, and Serapis and Roman Genii; they also relate to the cult of Bacchus.146 In the Classical world, snakes are creatures of the Underworld with chthonic properties, regarded as benificent and symbolic of rebirth and regeneration. Their sinuous shape clearly lent itself to jewellery design. Close parallels to this bracelet have been found at Stonea Grange.147 39. Penannular snake bracelet. Length: 4.9 cm. Bronze. Sheet. Bent over and almost broken in half. One terminal and a short length of hoop only, remain. Condition poor. Probably type Bii. Context 413. (FIG. 3, No. 7) This fragment is flat and ribbon-like with a narrow border, which is plain along the sides of the hoop but hatched irregularly round the head. The decoration is crudely and schematically rendered. The head markings are shown by a deeply incised V on either side of the upper surface; the points of the Vs occur at two punched dots, markers for the Vs but perhaps also representing the eyes. The tip of the jaws is blunt, with the metal cut straight across, as it is in several of the better-made bracelets from Snettisham.148 40. Complex snake ring. Length of head: 1.2 cm. Silver, cast. Terminal and short length of one recurved head only. Type Biv. Head type III. Context 553. (FIG. 3, No. 8) The oval, flattened snake-head is modelled stylistically in low relief. Behind the bead which forms the mouth, runs a narrow nasal ridge; this ends at the top of the head in two slanting bars, resembling an arrowhead pointing towards the neck: this arrowhead represents the reptile's brows.

Surrounding the skull is a border of raised beading and, beyond it, an outer border of short diagonal hatching. The fragment has broken off at an angle not far below the head which, together with the head markings, is reminiscent of a complex snake ring from Wicklewood, which has two snake-heads recurved back along the line of the hoop (Ring type Biv); this was found with a simple penannular snake-ring (Ring type Bii) linked through it.149 The Walsingham fragment is probably the result of a failed casting, but it is noteworthy that the ring from Wicklewood has been repaired at a similar point. Four complete and nine fragmentary rings of this type from the jeweller's hoard at Snettisham have recently been published, and a typology for the different types of stylised snake-heads has been established by Johns.150 The Walsingham snake-head belongs to head type iii.151 On the Wicklewood ring, the snake-heads recurve from the central hoop of the ring, which is decorated with three silver balls in a row, the balls enclosed within a figure-of-eight type border of beaded wire. The Snettisham examples have the three balls with or without scrolls or volutes of beaded wire. 41. Penannular snake ring. Measurements unknown as this ring has been lost. Bronze, cast. Condition unknown. Ring type Bii. Head type probably iii. Context 269. Found at Wighton, a short distance away from the probable temple area. The penannular ring is flat in section with two confronted stylised snake-heads. A photograph (not suitable for publication) from the collection at the SMR at Gressenhall shows that it was of type Bii, of which thirty-two were found in the Snettisham jeweller's hoard.152 The head appears to be type iii. 42. Snake ring. Diameter: 1.9 by 1.75 cm. Bronze. Condition good. Ring type Biii. Exact context not certain. (FIG. 3, No. 9) The plain wire hoop of this ring is squarish in section broadening in front where the outer surface is decorated with two simplified but fairly naturalistic, confronted snake-heads. These butt up on either side of a sub-rectangular gem or egg. The eyes of both heads are hooded, and behind the eyes of one there is a pair of incised transverse lines. This example is a simple version of Johns' ring type Biii.153 OBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH VOTIVE PRACTICE 43. Trulla handle. Now missing. Bronze. Hollow cast. Lacking the bowl of the trulla. Context 9. (PL. VIIIC) The handle had a terminal hole and the marks of an iron repair-plate to re-attach it to the bowl. It is a common form, dated to the first or second century A.D.154 It was found not far from where the temple is believed to have stood, along with general surface finds. These included tiles, flue-tiles, bricks and pottery-among them a greyware base with a palm frond scratched on the underside after firing, fragments of lava quern, and miscellaneous metal fragments (including scrap lead and bronze-casting waste). A trulla of this kind would have have been used to pour a libation of wine onto the altar before a sacrifice took place. The wine, mixed with burning incense, was believed to transport both deity and worshippers to a communal, liminal state. 44. Lead coin mould. 3.10 by 4.3 by 0.7 cm. Condition good. Context 561. (PL.

This may well be an example of an attempt to manufacture 'temple money' of some kind-that would carry special cachet when offered to the gods, and which might well have been sold to pilgrims for more than face-value. At the temple site of Woodeaton, coin impressions on sheet bronze were discovered, perhaps made for the same purpose.158 SEAL-BOXES Seal-boxes were small, hinged, usually bronze containers of different shapes and sizes, the lids of which were decorated, often with enamel. Their sides were usually notched and their bases each had three or four holes in the bottom. Cells of different shapes were cut or cast in the bronze lid which were then filled with coloured vitreous material. This is believed to have taken the form of frit (powdered glass) or pieces of coloured glass. In Romano-British work the cells were small and the design of an object structured by the reserved bronze; however, in continental Europe, possibly in the Rhineland, a style developed in which fewer metal divisions were used and colour became the main element, sometimes involving the insertion of millefiori glass.159 To secure a package or letter, the sender would tie it with a cord, resting the knot inside the base of an opened seal-box with the cord lodged in the notches in the sides of the base. The knot would then be covered with beeswax and stamped with the seal of the sender, using his intaglio ring. With the lid closed, the impression would thus be protected during transit. The procedure was probably different for the different shapes of seal-box: Holmes has suggested the following for a round box from Wroxeter: a piece of cord was taken; the centre of the cord was pulled through the central hole in the bottom of the base; the two ends were then passed round the package before being threaded through the loop made by passing the cord through the central hole. The knot was then tied and sealed.160 The large number of seal-boxes or parts of seal-boxes found on the temple site suggests that they might have had a particular role in votive practice (below, Discussion). The discovery of seal-boxes was recorded in a short report.161 FIG. 4 45. Large leaf-shaped seal-box lid. Length: 3.6 cm. Width: 2.3 cm. Depth: 0.3 cm. Bronze and enamel. Some enamel has decayed and some is missing, but the condition nevertheless is quite good. Context 407. Large, leaf-shaped lid with the normal recessed underside and pierced hinge-flange. The knobbed terminal retains on its lower face the small locating pin which ensures a close fit with the base. Within the stylised leaf-shaped border is a zone of blue enamel, which encloses a heart-shaped zone of red enamel. Within this, at the centre of the top of the heart, is a circular blue zone with a central spot of bronze. There is a smaller spot of blue set centrally in the red zone below this, and a further small spot of uncertain colour in the outer zone directly above it. This large leaf-shaped type was common in Britain in the second to third century A.D.162 46. Large leaf-shaped seal-box lid. Length: 4.6 cm. Width: 2.15 cm. Depth: 0.3 cm. Bronze and enamel. Lacks the pointed end and the pierced hinge flange. The condition of the enamel is poor. Context 469. Part of a large leaf-shaped lid with the normal recessed underside. Within the stylised border are the remains of a zone of enamel which is now very dark in colour. The heart-shaped zone inside this contains decayed red enamel. In place of the large spot of the previous entry, there is a long bronze droplet, with a smaller, rounded bronze droplet in the outer zone above. This is a variant of the type described above in No. 46.

Leaf-shaped lid with the normal recessed underside and pierced hinge-flange, now filled with corrosion. The knobbed terminal retains on its lower face the small locating pin which ensured a close fit with the base. Within the stylised scalloped border is a light brownish zone of decayed enamel, with a heart-shaped zone containing the same coloured enamel inside it. This contains a long bronze droplet. There is a rounded droplet in the outer zone above. Apart from its scalloped border, this seal-box is similar to the previous entry. 48. Small leaf-shaped seal-box. Length: 2.9 cm. Width: 1.4 cm. Bronze with tinning or silvering on the lid, most of it within the punched dots of the decoration. The remainder appears to have worn away. Part of the left side of the base is missing and the seal-box does not open. Context 30. Small leaf-shaped or pyriform seal-box. Heavy corrosion obscures some of the details of the hinge mechanism, but it appears that a hinge flange with a single piercing engages with the two pierced lugs of the base to form the hinge. Below the small terminal lug there is a locating pin in position. The lid is flat and decorated with a design of four petals or leaves, forming four quarters, pricked out in tiny punched dots within a border of similar dots. There is a large single dot in each quarter. The base is recessed and has three holes. The best parallel is a box from Studland in Dorset which is quartered by lines of chevrons instead of petals.164 49. Ovate seal-box lid. Length: 2.9 cm. Width: 1.6 cm. Bronze and enamel. Condition only fair. Context unknown. This lid is thin and flat. It has a hinge flange with a single piercing full of corrosion. The round terminal lug is recessed, perhaps for enamel. On the underside below it there is a worn locating pin. The surface of the lid is divided decoratively into a triangle and conjoined disc with two concentric fields. Within the outer field there were originally eight small recessed circles of which three can still be clearly seen, three show as traces, and the remaining two may be inferred. On the left side of the lid, the area surrounding the circles is worn and a small amount of shiny red enamel is present outside as well as inside the circles. On the right side nothing is left inside the holes, but some of a surrounding area of blue is still in situ. The inner field of the disc has the remains of a small central spot of red enamel, probably originally surrounded by a field of enamel. The triangle at the foot of the lid contains a tiny area of glassy mixture which suggests that it, too, was probably once enamelled. Several examples of the ovate type of seal-box are known, but none which is exactly similar. Holmes illustrates two examples from London165 and Hattat another from the East Riding of Yorkshire.166 50. Lozenge-shaped seal-box lid. Length: 3.2 cm. Width: 2 cm. Bronze and enamel. Much of the enamel has decayed and the base is missing. Context 454. This lid has the normal recessed underside and twenty-five diamond-shaped cells forming a latticed grid. The lid has a pierced hinge flange, a small knobbed terminal, and a knob at each side, the underside of which is hollowed out to act as a notch. There is a further notch higher on the left-hand side. Only seven cells still have enamel in situ. The four in the centre of the lid are a dark red; one in the middle of the red cells and one at each side are sand-coloured. The tiny quantities of enamel visible in some of the other fields are yellowish tinged with green. However, the green may be from the action of the bronze and they may all originally have been yellow. This is a fairly common type of seal-box lid. Atkinson illustrates an example from Wroxeter with four green cells in the centre surrounded by yellow, and Allason-Jones and Miket describe four from South Shields, one of which has alternate red and blue cells.167 Further examples are illustrated from London,168 from East Anglia,169 and from Stonea.170 164 Hattat 1989, 464, fig. 24, no. 152. 165 Holmes 1995, 393, fig. 2, nos 6-7. 166 Hattat 1989, 462, fig. 24, no. 141. 167 Atkinson 1942, 211, and pl.

Lozenge-shaped seal-box. Length: 4 cm. Width: 2.7 cm. Bronze and enamel. Complete and in very good condition apart from the decay of some of the enamel. Context 410. The lid of this handsome seal-box has the normal recessed underside. The hinge flange at the head has two piercings, the upper perhaps for a fine cord and the lower to fit between the two pierced lugs of the base and, together with the axis pin, form the hinge. There is a large terminal knob, and a smaller knob on each side with a V-shaped notch below it. The lid is decorated with an unusual geometric design: in the centre, a quartered circle contains diagonally arranged pairs of red and pale blue enamel. Outside the circle and set at right-angles to each other, are four petals or leaves containing the remains of the same pale blue enamel alternating with four small rectangles of yellow. The background colour behind the petals and the rectangles is red. The base of this seal-box has an inner vertical flange set in from the outside edge to ensure a good fit with the lid; there is a notch on the sides of the base where it fits below the side knobs of the lid, and another notch further down the left side. The base has four small round holes. Only one seal-box lid that resembles it even slightly has been found in Britain.171 The lozengiform construction is quite common and is seen again in the two lids below and in two of the bases. 52. Lozenge-shaped seal-box lid. Length: 3.6 cm. Width: 2.3 cm. Bronze and enamel. Lacks the base and a little of the enamel but is otherwise in quite good condition. Context 651. The lid has the normal recessed underside and a pierced hinge flange. There is a small knobbed terminal and a smaller boss on both sides, beneath each of which is a rounded triangular notch. The lid is decorated in enamel with a Celtic design using opposed, recurved motifs and hearts containing droplets. The hearts are filled with yellow enamel. The recurves and the areas round the hearts appear to have been red. The central horizontal band is blue. Hattat illustrates a similar example from near Lincoln.172 Others have been found at South Shields,173 Wroxeter,174 and Corbridge.175 53. Square seal-box lid. Lost.

The square lid has the normal recessed underside and a hinge flange with two piercings halfway along one side, the lower piercing engaging with the two lugs of the base and the pin to form the hinge. The design on the lid is based on the Celtic 'swash N' motif, first recognised by Leeds,176 and described by MacGregor in her 'Grammar of Ornament'.177 A little is left of the pale green enamel background; the enamel remaining within the cornucopiae/trumpets and degenerate tails is now very dark. The base is also recessed. Its low sides have no vertical flange to seat the lid. There are four holes in the base and a rectangular notch halfway down on either side. A rectangular seal-box lid from Billingsgate, which has a small lobe at each corner of the lid, is decorated with a similar but not identical design.178 55. Rectangular seal-box.

The underside of the lid and the inside of the base are recessed, and rectangular notches halfway along the two sides of both line up to form one large notch on either side. The lid is decorated with a central disc of blue enamel surrounding a dot of bronze. Eight more bronze dots form a border round the outside of the lid in an uneven field of brownish-grey material, which appears to be decayed enamel. No parallel for this seal-box has so far been discovered. FIG. 5 56. Circular seal-box lid. Length: 3.3 cm. Width: 2.2 cm. Bronze and enamel. Some of the enamel has decayed but the pattern is still visible. It lacks a base. Context 470. Wheel-shaped lid with the normal recessed underside. At the head is a pierced hinged flange. The upper surface of the terminal lug is recessed and decorated with a pattern of incised circles; it may once have held enamel. On the lower face of the lug is a small locating pin, which ensured a close fit with the base. Between them, a wide recessed felloe surrounds a circular openwork area comprising a ring for the hub and six radial spokes, formed of wire of sub-rectangular section. The spokes are set into small decorative rectangular 'chocks' where they meet the felloe. The felloe contains the remains of red enamel juxtaposed with enamel of another colour, now largely absent. The different colours of the field are not individually delineated. The closest parallel for this seal-box has no spokes and hub.179 Like many other round lids, both these boxes are clearly related to the enamelled disc brooch. 57. Circular seal-box lid. Length: 2.65 cm. Width: 2.1 cm. Bronze and enamel. Lacks the base and some cells of enamel. Context 652. The circular lid has a very shallow recessed underside and a pierced hinge-flange; there is no locating pin opposite the hinge. The reserve for this lid was created by cutting or casting a central bronze disc, surrounded by a single ring of outward-pointing triangles of bronze forming the twelve points of a star, within a wide outer border of bronze; the twelve triangular reserves between the points were filled with enamel of red and probably some other colour, arranged alternately. Red enamel remains in five alternate cells; the rest is missing. The central disc is decorated with two concentric incised circles and there is a small hole in the centre, which may have been filled with enamel (see below). No similar seal-box has been discovered, but the design resembles that found on several plate brooches.180 58. Circular seal-box lid. Length, including lug and hinge flange: 3.2 cm. Width: 2.5 cm. Bronze and enamel. Part of the hinge flange has broken off and the base is missing. Context 456. The underside of this circular lid is flat, but there is a small locating pin beneath the recessed circular terminal lug, confirming that it is a seal-box rather than a disc brooch. A divider separates the upper surface into two concentric segments. The inner circle is decorated with red enamel with a small, sunken, sub-circular, roughened spot of yellow in the middle; without laboratory analysis it is not possible to diagnose its composition; there are no corresponding marks on the underside. The surrounding outer field may have been enamelled, but there is little sign of any enamel now. There is an incomplete circle raised in very low relief in this reserve, immediately within its moulded border. As with the previous two seal-boxes, the design on this lid is related to a design seen on disc brooches.181 59. Circular seal-box lid. Length: 2.4 cm. Diameter of disc: 1.9 cm. Bronze and enamel. The surface of the bronze is tinned or silvered. The condition is good apart from the missing base. Context 455. The hinge flange of this small round lid has a single piercing. The underside is very shallowly recessed and there is no locating pin to seat it in the base. The lid is decorated with a cast design of six alternately raised and recessed concentric circles which retains much of its original tinning. In the centre is a small circle of turquoise enamel, evidently inserted into a hole in the lid, as signs of the hole and the enamel are apparent on the underside.

DISCUSSION The archaeological finds provide a wealth of data, from which it is clear that there was a cult of Mercury at Walsingham. Evidence is provided by the three very different Mercury figurines, the two goats, the three cocks, and the three silver rings. Belief in the powers of other gods also existed, as the figurine and applique mount of Minerva-and the images of different deities on rings-confirm. Evidence of the worship of Mercury has been found elsewhere in Norfolk: Caister-by-Yarmouth, Stanhoe, Tuttington, and Wicklewood have each produced a figurine, Caister St Edmund the relief with a snake-ring torc mentioned above, and Brampton a lead plaque with a Mercury bust. There is also the interesting three-horned bust, which could be a native horned woodland god or possibly a native version of Mercury. At the same time there are indications of the existence of a cult of Bacchus/Silvanus/Faunus in the same vicinity, as suggested by the two Cupid masks and the three depictions of satyrs. Satyrs, as seen above,184 are associated with the early, rustic, fertility god Faunus and are also part of the Bacchic thiasos, together with Cupid, who is sometimes substituted for the young Bacchus.185 Johns has pointed out that, iconographically, Faunus is hard to identify and that his image would have much in common with images of other rural deities. She suggests that the obscurity of the cult of Faunus in Britain may stem from the use of the ancient Latian name for the same concept of a rustic fertility god.'86 There is already evidence for a Bacchus/Silvanus/ Faunus cult in other parts of the county. A very fine applique protome of a stag's head was found at Brampton, the second most important town in Roman Norfolk.187 Recently, a head mount from Elsing in Central Norfolk has been identified as Pan, and a mask of Pan recognised from the Thetford area.188 Spoons found in the Thetford treasure on the Norfolk/Suffolk border have the name Faunus inscribed on them and the Thetford gold buckle is decorated with a satyr (see Nos 10-12).189 There is more evidence for Silvanus elsewhere in East Anglia. At Colchester, in north Essex, a small bronze stag was discovered within the side, and near the top, of a pit adjoining the temenos of the temple excavated at the Royal Grammar School. Lower down in the same pit was a bronze plaque with ansate ends bearing the dedication 'To the god Silvanus Hermes willingly and gladly fulfils his obligation'. Nearby, in the north-eastern part of the enclosure, on what was thought to be the ancient ground level, another plaque with ansate ends was found inscribed with a dedication to Silvanus by Cintismus the coppersmith, also fulfilling a vow.190 A second small stag, unfortunately now lost, was discovered in what had been Insula 8; the report written in 1952 by Wire runs '1.5 in. high and 2 in. long, having the horns united at the top 184 See No. 10. 185 See No. 8. 186 Johns and Potter 1983, 51. 187 Henig 1995, 97, fig. 62. 188 Davies 1996, 380-4. 189 Johns and Potter 19.83, 34-48, 79-81, colour pl. 1. 190 Hull 1958, 238-9.</page><page sequence="28">48 JEAN BAGNALL SMITH by a modius, a bronze stylus, two metal ornaments, a bone pin and a coin of Vespasian, very much corroded, found in an artificial mound'.191 According to Wright, all the two dozen or so dedications to Silvanus, known in 1948, had been made by soldiers, so that these-made by a coppersmith and, from his name, probably a slave or a freedman-were exceptional.192 The existence of an association or collegium of worshippers of Silvanus in the Essex area has been confirmed by the inscription Col(legium) dei Sil(vani) on a finger-ring found at Wendens Ambo. Henig has suggested that this ring allowed members to enter meetings of the collegium.'93 It is interesting to see evidence of the introduction of Roman ideas and concepts and their fusing with the already ancient practice of making offerings to the gods. Much that was new was absorbed, and different formalities adopted for the same purpose. Out of this collection of possible votive objects, the three-horned bust and two of the seal-boxes, in particular, are a reminder that Iron Age concepts and artistic styles were not superseded but conflated with Roman culture. Iron Age influence was noticed in the case of several finds in the Fox collection, which-because they could not be described as votive-have not been included here. In addition to seven scatters of building remains and a pottery kiln, Walsingham with Wighton had three known areas of metalworking.194 At one of the last a bronze model axe was found with a cylindrical object, both untrimmed from the bi-valve moulds in which they were made.195 The bronze-smith was probably making cult objects to sell as votives for dedication in the temple and, possibly, trinkets and souvenirs as well: many temples are believed to have been the site of fairs.196 Other bronze-working sites have been found not far away at Brampton, Kempstone, Snettisham and in the greensand area west of Narford, in west Norfolk. There was bronze-working at Wicklewood, also a temple site, where there may be evidence of enamelling.197 A second-century brooch-making site was discovered, in 1995, in SE Norfolk.198 Some of the more elaborate brooches from Walsingham appear to have been imported from northern continental Europe, possibly reflecting continuation of trading ties that existed in the Iron Age.199 The two silver rings with intaglios on cornelian and the snake jewellery are similar to rings and bracelets from the Snettisham jeweller's hoard;200 they may have been made at Snettisham, or by an itinerant worker from the circle of the Snettisham smith. Most interesting of all is the potentially significant realisation that there is at Walsingham convincing evidence for both parts of the ritual practice of the votum. The bronze objects described in the catalogue above and the huge number of brooches and coins had seemed likely to be votive, but there was no way of proving that any had been given in fulfilment of a formal vow. It is possible that the unusually large number of seal-boxes, of which twenty-two are recorded here, provides a missing link. Twenty-two boxes are recorded in the Norfolk SMR, but exact 'matching' with the boxes in the collection was not always possible, as some of the details in the SMR were brief. The total includes the odd lids and bases that did not 'match up' with each other, as well as the whole boxes. The ideas expressed below follow on from a hypothesis put forward by Derks, to explain the discovery of an unusually large number of seal-boxes at a sanctuary in the Rhineland.201 Derks has 191 Hull 1958, 93, quoting from the diaries of William Wire (1/5/52). 192 Hull 1958, 239. 193 Henig 1984, 165; RIB 247, 270. 194 Gurney 1995, 57-9. 195 Information from the late Tony Gregory to the SMR at Gressenhall, which has photographs. 196 For instance, Woodeaton in Oxfordshire. 197 Information from the Castle Museum, Norwich. 198 Davies 1997, 27. 199 Cunliffe 1995, 12-14, fig. 2. 200 Kleibrink 1997, 25-33; Johns 1997a, 34-40, 85-106. 201 Derks 1995, 118-2.</page><page sequence="29">VOTIVE OBJECTS FROM GREAT WALSINGHAM 49 published a map to show the distribution of seal-box finds in northern Gaul and the Rhineland.202 These were discovered at military camps, on settlement sites, and in graves; but seven cult places each produced either one or two boxes and four, more than two. He illustrated fourteen of them from the sanctuary at Empel in Holland.203 From this evidence, he deduced that seal-boxes had had other uses apart from enclosing the seals of private letters and testaments, and that he had, at the same time, arrived at a possible explanation for the absence of nuncupationes. The votum was a complex contract between man and deity which began and ended with a formal ritual act. In the first act, known as the nuncupatio, a particular favour was asked and a vow solemnly pledged to give or do certain things if the favour were granted. In the final ritual act-the solutio-provided that the petitioner was satisfied that the favour requested had been granted, the vow would be fulfilled. When performed in the classical manner, both parts would be recorded with an inscription. For a model Derks took the only really well-documented source, which is the acta of the fratres Arvales, the well-known college of priests in Rome. Derks had no difficulty in finding inscriptions testifying to the existence of the solutio in northern Gaul and the Rhineland, his study area.204 However, the only example of a nuncupatio that he had been able to find in the whole of North-West Europe was inscribed on a dedication slab from a small temple at Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria.205 This recorded the dedication of the shrine to the Mother-Goddesses and a vow by the dedicator, one Antonianus, to gild the letters of his inscription, if the goddesses granted him 'increase of his venture'.206 We do not know who Antonianus was and, for whatever reason, the vow appears not to have been fulfilled; the letters of the inscription show no traces of gilding now, nor are they recorded as gilded when found c. 1790.207 The only other inscriptions recorded that relate to nuncupationes are those on lead tablets; these also represent a contract with the deity, and are nuncupationes of a particular kind. A large number have been found at certain British shrines, for instance at Bath and Uley, and it may well be that, in the past, archaeologists have failed to recognise some for what they were, dismissing them as rolled up fragments of lead sheet, covered with scratches. Many are concerned with theft and requests for divine intervention to punish the thief. The most interesting example from Norfolk is the tablet found on the bank of the River Tas, not far from the temple at Caister St Edmund. This lists an extensive theft and reads 'If you, (Neptune) want the pair of leggings they shall become yours at the price of his (the thief's) blood'. As Henig has said, 'It is hard to imagine the great god of the sea in trousers, but no doubt stranger objects were frequently left in shrines'.208 Vows could be of a public nature made officially, for example, by priests, army officers, or magistrates, or they could be made privately by individuals. Derks found that most religious inscriptions recording fulfilment of vows in northern Gaul and the Rhineland were of a private nature. He believed that these solutiones had been preceded by nuncupationes in the formal classical manner and that, perhaps, the answer to the virtual absence of nuncupationes in his area of study, and throughout much of the Empire, lay in the difference in character between the two parts of the vow. In the solutio, often the dedicator would be addressing himself, via the deity, to others visiting the sanctuary, in which case an inscription on a reasonably permanent material would be essential. But, in the nuncupatio, the first part of the votum, the petitioner was making a direct and personal appeal to the deity, for which a permanent material would be unnecessary. 202 Derks 1995, 125. 203 Derks 1995, 111, n.

Juvenal, Satires 12.100.</page><page sequence="30">50 JEAN BAGNALL SMITH Derks quoted the use by Classical writers of tituli (inscriptions)209 and libelli (small books) for nuncupationes210 and suggested that the 'small books' must have meant wooden writing-tablets. A single tablet would have sufficed where privacy was not required and was probably a frequent way of making a less formal nuncupatio; but Derks suggesteJ that the practice of closing a pair with the waxed surfaces innermost, tying them- with cord, and sealing them, would have been used for nuncupationes of a private nature. The seal would then have been enclosed within a seal-box, for protection. It was understandable, Derks argued, that many petitioners would have preferred to keep their requests and their vows to themselves. He referred to a letter written from Bithynia by Pliny to his friend the Emperor Trajan in Rome, in which Pliny reported that he had fulfilled his annual duty as governor of the province and undertaken vota for the Emperor's protection. Pliny made it clear that some vows, particularly those not considered suitable for public view, were sealed like a legal document and opened and fulfilled on the date stipulated; in the case of the annual vows for the health and safety of the emperor, this took place at the beginning of January.211 Derks concluded that other than in exceptional archaeological conditions, the only trace remaining of the ritual of the nuncupatio carried out in this way would have been the seal-box.212 The satyrical sketch Alexander the False Prophet, written by Lucian in the later second century, provides support for Derks' reasoning. This tells of a unscrupulous scoundrel who set up an oracle, with himself as the prophet of that oracle, to exploit the superstitious and the gullible in contemporary society who were, he judged, invariably ruled by hope or fear. He directed all those desiring to consult the oracle to write their wishes in a scroll and to tie this up and seal it with wax or clay. He would then, by various means suggested in the sketch, ingeniously open the scroll and supply the answers without, apparently, having broken the seal. The significance of this is that the first part of the ritual of the vow, the nuncupatio, was to be written on a scroll-like the wooden writing-tablets a perishable medium-and sealed, before being offered in the temple.213 The twenty-two seal-boxes, or parts of seal-boxes, provide strong evidence for the formal practice of the first part of the votum at Walsingham, but many more boxes are likely to have been left at the temple originally. The actual number found is irrelevant, apart from the fact that it has drawn attention to the possible practice, because nuncupationes would probably not have remained in a sanctuary beyond the time stipulated in the legal wording of the vow. This would be the main reason for there not being more at Walsingham and possibly for the absence of seal-boxes at other cult sites. There may, of course, be some seal-boxes still to be found on temple sites and others that were re-cycled in antiquity. It is probable, also, that this form of private nuncupatio was not practised at all temples in Britain or by all strata of society. But what of the second part, the solutio? No inscribed stone tablets or altars are known from Walsingham, but this is not surprising in an area short of stone. Nor are there any sheet metal plaques or other finds bearing votive inscriptions which include the letters 'VSLM'. Lack of written evidence of the solutio may perhaps be explained by a desire for privacy or by allowing the sacrifice of an animal, generally included in a nuncupatio, to suffice. But it seems likely that the unusually large collection of near-perfect brooches, and the huge number of coins could provide at least part of the answer. Where a large number of brooches are found in a cult place they are likely to have been votive,214 and brooches certainly appear to have been popular as votives in the earlier Roman period.

One of these has 'VOT FEC' inscribed on one part of the bow and IOV on another.217 While there do not appear to be any inscriptions that refer to the votum on brooches from Britain, there are examples of rings inscribed with either the abbreviated name of the deity,218 or the name of the deity in the dative case,219 or the word 'dedi'.220 Where found in association with a temple or shrine, these may have been solutiones although such rings were often worn simply as protective charms. A large number of the brooches from Walsingham appear to be of second-century date, which would correspond with the date of many of the enamelled seal-boxes described above.221 Seal-boxes went out of use in Britain during the third century. Signet-rings also disappear c. A.D. 250.222 Derks found that, at much the same time, epigraphic recording of the solutio ceased in Gaul and the Rhineland.223 It could be that, at this time, the ritual of the vow changed character and that some of the classical formalities were dropped. Over 4,659 coins, more than two thirds of all those discovered on the Walsingham/Wighton site, were found in the immediate area of the conjectured site of the temple.224 Derks tells how, for the poor, the practice of offering coins to fulfil a vow would have replaced the sacrificial animal and votive monument.225 It seems likely that at Walsingham, adherence to Roman ritual practice was restricted to the elite, whose solutiones are represented by figurines, busts, and the more substantial votive objects including, perhaps, the grander brooches, whilst the offerings of the poor were usually coins or the simpler brooches. The ritual practice of the votum would have been introduced into Britain by the Roman army; in recent years, early garrison forts have been identified at Swanton Morley, Horstead, Threxton, Ashill, Caister St Edmund, and possibly Baylham Mill; in the third-century, forts were built at Brancaster and Caister-on-Sea. The practice would then have spread to those aspiring to a Roman life-style as a way of confirming their position in society, as would ownership of one of the string of villas with evidence of hypocausts, mosaics, and wall-plaster, found near the northern end of the Icknield Way226 or the newly discovered villa near Holt, not far from Walsingham.227 Selection of artefacts for this study has been limited to those that are generally accepted as votive, those that seem likely to have been votive because of where they were found, and those that were associated with votive practice. Dave Fox's collection is large, and amongst it there are doubtless other objects that were offerings. But enough of exceptional interest has been discussed 215 Kirk 1949, 5. 216 Wickenden 1992, 19. 217 CIL XIII.10027, no. 147; this brooch was found at Sissy (Aisne), in France. 218 MER: RIB 2422.29 from Chesterholm and RIB 2422.30 from Billingford; the example from Stonea, see n. 103, and No. 18 in the catalogue above from Walsingham.

The finds themselves provide a great deal of new information about the practice of religion in Roman Britain. But we need to know more about the temple itself, how it related to the town, its development, and its decline; the coin evidence indicates late activity in Walsingham/Wighton and there are Saxon finds which suggest some overlap with the Roman settlement.228 Finally, Walsingham was a famous centre for pilgrimage in the Middle Ages and has remained so. The possibility of some sort of continuity between Roman and later sites deserves investigation.

Wicks for his photographs. I am most grateful to the Meyerstein Bequest, administered by the Committee for Archaeology of the University of Oxford and to the Craven Committee of the same university for financial help with travelling expenses. I am grateful, too, to Justine Bayley of English Heritage for advice over metalwork. I would also like, here, to thank Jane Inskipp of the Ashmolean Museum, and Jonathan Bardill, Esther Cameron, Alison Coveley, Philip Kenrick, Richard Osgood, Eberhard Sauer, Nigel Spencer, Alison Wilkins, and Robert Wilkins, who are colleagues at the Institute of Archaeology, Oxford; their guidance and support on this project has been invaluable. This article would never have been written without the generous interest, advice and encouragement of my supervisor, Dr Martin Henig. To him, above all, I owe an immeasurable debt.
