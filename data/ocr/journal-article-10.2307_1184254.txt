<plain_text><page sequence="1">Water Sprites: The Elders of the Fish in Aboriginal North America by Ake Hultkrantz 1. The Issue T HE FOLLOWING essay will present a survey of ideas held by the North American Indians and their Eskimo congeners on the so- called supernatural masters of the fishes and the fishing-the two concepts are mostly interchangeable. For practical reasons the super- natural masters of seals and other sea mammals will also be considered in this survey. There is no great difference either in technical activities or in associated belief systems between seal hunting and fishing. In both cases the environment is similar and stimulates the same mea- sures. The figure of the supernatural master (or owner, or lord, or ruler, or guardian, or "boss") of the animals, of certain animal species, or of the birds or the fish, is a central one in many hunting and fishing populations (cf. Paulson 1964). It is a most widespread concept among foraging tribes and groups in Africa (see e.g. Baumann 1939), Eurasia (R6hrich 1959, Paulson 1961, 1962) and America (Hultkrantz 1961, 1981:135-46, Haekel 1959, Zerries 1954, 1962). The reasons for its prominence are obvious. In an existence built up on hunting and fishing the animals, birds and fishes naturally form the focus of the individual's thoughts and imaginations. Supernatural experiences and religious tales concentrate on animal personages. The idea of a lord of the game animals is an application of the religious idea that a supernatural being is in charge of groups of living beings. This con- viction is well expressed in what a French missionary to the Montagnais Indians (north of the St. Lawrence River) tells us of their beliefs in 1634: "They also say that all animals, of every species, have an elder brother, who is, as it were, the source and origin of all individuals, and this elder brother is wonderfully great and powerful .. ..Now these elders of all the animals are the juniors of the Messou" (Kenton 1954:53). The point is that Messou is the protector of the human beings, the culture hero, better known as Manabozho (cf. Alexander 1916:32). In the same way as he has protected his clients, the human beings, the masters of the animals have guarded their clients, the animals. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 Where fishing is a conspicuous part of tribal economy the super- natural beings that protect the fish or provide good luck in fishing are propitiated. The supenatural master of the fishes is an adequate religious response to the worries and wishes of the fishing population. Nothing or practically nothing has been written on the North American owner of the fishes, besides the sources proper, and a review of the manifestations of this concept should therefore have a certain value. It would have been useful to investigate tribe for tribe the current fish-owner conceptions. However, due to space restrictions no exhaustive inventory can be presented here. Instead my aim has been to list representative cases. My analysis is however based upon a careful perusal of all the main ethnographical documents. Of course, a full treatment is rather impossible since relevant data are often buried in obscure publications, otherwise irrelevant works, foot-notes in travel journals, and so on. The background material for the present essay exists as a specific chapter in my manuscript on the Master of the Game in North America, to be published some time in the future. Some words should appropriately be said about the source ma- terials. First, there is lack of information from many areas, mainly due to culture loss before the setting in of ethnological and folkloristic research. On the other hand, we are well-informed on the master beliefs in some bygone cultures thanks to the detailed reports of early Jesuit missionaries: I refer here to the Iroquois-Huron-Algonkian pop- ulations around the eastern Great Lakes. Second, the sources we have are very uneven, to no little extent depending on the lack of interest in some source writers, be they missionaries or anthropologists. Third, the sources do not too often convey to us the genres of oral tradition. Where possible I have relied upon the informal sayings that contain the beliefs proper (Hultkrantz 1968), or upon the memorates that reflect personal experiences (Honko 1964). In some cases it has been necessary to adduce tales which however, according to the prevailing view of the informants, should be classified as "true" (cf. Bascom: 1965). Unfortunately most ethnologists only give us a summary of what they have found people to believe, without accounting for the structural contexts of these beliefs. The reader should be aware that the beliefs as expressed by the Indians themselves are frequently very vague. An expert in Athapascan Indian religion like Father Jett6 states that, whereas among the Coyukon Indians of Alaska there is a certain uniformity in ritual practices "there are very few points of belief common to several individuals, and these are of the vaguest kind" (Jett6 1911:95). This statement refers to a people with an extreme individualistic outlook and little social organization, but I think that in the main it holds good for</page><page sequence="3">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 3 most American Indian groups. When descriptions of fish-owners are founded upon private experiences they sometimes give evidence of concretion and perspicuity; as a rule, however, they do not provide us with sufficient information. In the subsequent account emphasis is laid on analysis of type variations of the master-of-the-fish concept, of its historical position- where this is at all determinable-and ecological integration. A short summary of area concepts will also be presented. To begin with, however, the idea of the fish-owner will be exhibited in detail as it appears in one particular group. It so happens that the Ojibway ma- terials are exceptionally rich on the subject, and I shall therefore, advantageously, start with a presentation of Ojibway beliefs (for Ojibway owners of animals, see Hallowell 1934:391; Tyrell 1916:83; Vecsey 1983:76). 2. An Ojibway Paradigm Forth upon the Gitche Gumee, On the shining Big-Sea-Water, With his fishing-line of cedar, Of the twisted bark of cedar, Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma, Nishe-Nahma, King of Fishes, In his birch canoe exulting All alone went Hiawatha. These famous lines from Longfellow's Hiawatha (1855), and indeed the whole poem on Hiawatha's Fishing (Longfellow 1968:73 ff.), were inspired by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's reproduction of the Ojibway Indian tale of Manabozho's fishing in Algic Researches (1839)(Williams 1956:69 f.). The Ojibway, or Chippewa, Indians are Algonkian-speaking hunters, fishermen, and wild rice gatherers living in the areas south and north of Lake Superior. Manabozho is their mythical culture hero who once upon the time arranged the world and gave the Indians their institutions; his confusion with the Iroquois political hero Hia- watha was Longfellow's invention (later endorsed by the enthnographer Schoolcraft!). In the original Indian tale Manabozho calls upon Me- she-nah-ma-gwai, "king of fishes," to take hold of his bait. Being annoyed the kingfish sends the trout and then the sunfish, but Man- abozho refuses to accept them. At last the giant fish allows himself to be caught, but swallows both Manabozho and his canoe. However, Manabozho kills the monster while in its stomach and escapes.' "King of fishes" is certainly no Indian denomination, but School- craft's own invention, copied, of course, by Longfellow. When the same</page><page sequence="4">4 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 appellation appears in the German author and explorer Johan Georg Kohl's version of the story, recorded among the Ojibway, the influence from Schoolcraft is obvious even here (Kohl 1859 II:19 ff.). Behind the European expression there seems to lie, however, the idea of some kind of a ruler of the different species of fish. This is perhaps more apparent when the same type of expression recurs in popular traditions that originate in a more recent time and cannot be classified as myths. In one of the Ojibway traditions recorded by Schoolcraft there is mention of a young man left alone by an old evil-minded "magician" on an island in Lake Superior as an offering to the "great king of fishes." We are told how "a monstrous fish thrust his long snout from the water, crawled partially on the beach, and opened wide his jaws to receive his victim." Fortunately, the young man managed to persuade the monster to carry him over the water in return for a piece of red cloth (Williams 1956:165 f.). Mentor Williams considers that the monster fish depicted one of the gigantic sturgeons that once filled Lake Superior (Williams 1956:168 n. 4). This is possible, but in that case the idea must have been contaminated with existing beliefs in water monsters. It is indeed interesting to note that both Longfellow and Kohl identify the kingfish of the Manabozho myth with the sturgeon (Kohl 1859 11:143; for Longfellow, cf. the introductory verse). The circumstances show however that the king of fishes was, above all, a manitou, or spirit: he received offerings. The piece of cloth was indeed a conventional offering to water spirits among the Ojibway (Landes 1968:31). There are two things we learn about the water sprite here under discussion. First, that he was a rather malignant being (Kohl 1859 II: 143). This may be interpreted in conformity with the fact that all over the world aquatic spirits often show evil incli- nations.2 However, in this case the fact that the spirit was identical with the water monster is most important (cf. Vecsey 1983:74-5). Like its Dakota counterpart the Ojibway water monster was a representative of the dark powers that stood against the upper powers; he was thus a perpetual enemy of the Thunderbird, the symbol of the Sky powers (Landes 1968:31; cf. Alexander 1916:44 f.). Second, the most important in this connection, the water sprite we have discused was, as "king of the fishes," a ruler, or supernatural owner of the fish. This is clearly evident from the Manabozho myth, but it is also implied in the story of the evil magician. The kingfish controlled the fish, and put them at the human being's disposal from time to time. Let us now consider some more recent records. Writing on the Ojibway of Parry Island (Georgian Bay)3 Diamond Jenness has this to say about their ideas of animal masters, and particularly the masters of the fishes: ". . . just as the Ojibwa have their chiefs (ogimma) or</page><page sequence="5">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 5 leading men, so there are ogimma or 'bosses' (to use a word from the lumber camps that the Indians themselves employ) among animals, birds, and fish, even among the trees. There is no single chief ruling the whole Ojibwa nation, but a chief in every band; similarly there is no single boss for every species of animal or plant, but a boss in each locality. The bosses are always larger than other plants and animals of their kind, and in the case of animals (including birds and fish) always white. They generally keep out of sight of human beings, but now and then the Indians see and kill them. One informant had seen a boss of the pickerel in a rapid 3 or 4 miles behind Parry Sound; it was about 20 feet long, all white, and it lay-a foot or two below the surface of the water, so surrounded with other pickerel that the pebbles on the bottom were invisible" (Jenness 1935:22 f.). This account ascribes a master to the species of pikes, and thus deviates from Schoolcraft's narrative according to which all fishes of the lake were subordinated to the big sturgeon, king of fishes. There is reason to presuppose that there are or were differences in belief contents between various areas depending upon regional zoological conditions as well as regional historical traditions. In some lakes, apparently, the fishes of a certain species were supposed to be controlled by a giant elder of their kind; in other lakes the largest fish species, typified by one of their kind- in reality a spirit of course-played the same role. In both cases the boundary-lines between the actual animal and the spirit-fish seem to have been, in practice at least, rather arbitrary. The masters of the fish have to be kept apart from other animal masters that could be associated with waters. There was, for instance, the boss of the turtles, an enormous snapping turtle that scared men (Jenness 1935:23, 42). We must likewise differentiate between the owner of the water animals and the owner of the waters. Among the Ojibway, "practically every lake, river, rapid, mountain or other feature of the landscape had a spirit controlling its behavior" (Kinietz 1947:160). There is a unanimous opinion that before travelling by boat a fisherman had to make offerings of tobacco to insure safe passage and success in fishing (Hilger 1951:62 f., Jenness 1935:45, Kinietz 1947:160 ff.). The anger of the spirit could be aroused by throwing "nasty" things in the lake, like dogs and cats (Hilger 1936:20). The forms of appearance of the water sprite are not always mentioned-perhaps it was mostly not personified-but there are reports on mermen and mermaids as well as huge snakes (Jenness 1935:43, 45).4 It seems to have been a matter of local beliefs and personal inclination if a fisherman turned his mind on the owner of the fishes or the owner of the water. Certainly, while in some areas the two must have been separate beings, in other places they must have been indistinct.</page><page sequence="6">6 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 There is, in the Archives des colonies in Paris, a manuscript written in 1719 by a M. Pachot, in which the Ojibway are said to make sacrifices to the spirits of the lakes and in particular to "Bichy Bichy", master of them all, and god of the waters. He is portrayed as a sea tiger provided with fins. He roams at the bottom of the lakes, and his breath brings forth the tempests. Other spirits in the lakes act for him (Archives des colonies, C 11 A, quoted in Kinietz 1940:328). If Pachot is right this would mean that there was a hierarchy of water spirits. Before discussing this possibility some words should be said about the identify of Bichy Bichy. There is some confusion on this point. Kinietz identifies him with the Michapoux mentioned by several writers from the same time (Kinietz 1940:328, cf. 371 f.). However, Michapoux, "the Great Hare," is another name of the culture hero, and no master of the waters, Kinietz however does not discriminate between different concepts: "The confusion of the names of the being called variously, Michabou, Michipissy, the Great Hare, and the Great Panther is prob- ably best accounted for by the supposition that they were all aspects of the same mythological being now known as Manabozho," i.e., the Manabozho or culture hero (Kinietz 1940:297). Kinietz takes here the same standpoint as did Thwaites, the editor of the Jesuit Relations, at the turn of the last century. If however we look closer into the documents we receive a different impression. "Bichy Bichy" is a dis- tortion of the name Michibichi or Missibizi, a divinity discussed by the XVIIth century Jesuit fathers, Allouez and Rasles (Thwaites 1896- 1901 L:288, LXVII:158-60). This Michibichi is certainly no variant of Manabozho, but the owner of the fishes. There is no trace of his being a culture hero. This is, for instance, how Rasles describes him: "Ils nomment Michibichi Manitou des eaux et des poissons, et lui font un sacrifice a peu pres semblable, lorsqu'ils vont a la peche, ou qu'ils entreprennent un voyage. Ce sacrifice consiste a jeter dans l'eau du tabac, des vivres, des chaudieres, en lui demandant que les eaux de la riviere coulent plus lentement, que les rochers ne brisent pas leurs canots, et qu'il leur accorde une peche abondante" (Thwaites 1896-1901 LXVII: 158- 60). In this information, that is consistent with our information from later times, there is no hint of Michibichi being the culture hero. On the contrary, it is directly stated that we are dealing with a spirit of the water and the fish-a master of fishes. Nor is there in this statement talk of any hierarchy of spirits. We may very well suspect that Pachot had constructed such a hierarchy in his own mind (just like European officials saw a king in each petty chief). However, in certain pronouncements from the last decades we perceive a tendency to stratification of spirit powers. Thus, in the</page><page sequence="7">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 7 words of a Parry Island Ojibway: "There is a big boss manido, the chief of all the manidos. He stays somewhere in one place, sitting quietly and supervising everything. He is like the captain on a steam- boat, or like the Government that remains in Ottawa, yet has its servants all over the country. So the Great Manido has lesser bosses in different regions, and they have lesser manidos under them" (Jenness 1935:30). The term manido stands here for spirit (usually rendered manitou in other discussions of Algonkian religions). The great spirit talked about here is of course the Supreme Being, an original Algonkian concept. The idea of his strict supervising of other beings in ranks may, as Jenness suggests, have its provenience in Christian doctrine. It may also, however, reflect the more complicated social structure that, as a consequence of white man's impact, characterized Ojibway society a couple of hundred years ago (cf. Hickerson 1971:173, 176- 78). It is finally possible that an original loose segmentation of ideas was gradually consciously arranged in a logical stratified pattern. In any case, our later sources are unanimous in pointing out that the spirit-bosses act on behalf of the Great Spirit who, in his unap- proachable high abode, watches over the welfare of man-thus also over the fishing (Jenness 1935:29, Hilger 1951:60, Kinietz 1947:151, 154 f.). It should be noticed in this connection that the mediating role of the owners is seldom brought forth in the actual memorates. However, the idea is there, and it is in variance with most information on animal owners from other tribes in North America. The rule is that the Supreme Being is actualized in crisis situations and at great annual thanksgiving ceremonies. He then appears also as a giver of fish and other animals. On other, normal everyday occasions the annual bosses take over. There is, however, a complication in the functions of the fish owner among the Ojibway. In Siberia and, perhaps, South America the master of the fishes was the foremost spirit-helper at fishing. In North America however his role was often eclipsed by the individual's own guardian spirit, a concept peculiar to North American Indians (see Benedict 1923, especially 48 f.). The guardian spirit might be identical with the master of animal or fish species, but this question is far from solved (see Hultkrantz 1961:62 f., 1981:144 f.). Common to both spirit categories was that they constituted prototypes of the respective animal and fish species (cf. Jenness 1935:54). If now we return to the Ojibway we find that the person's guardian spirit extended to his client the help and protection when fishing that at other places was granted by the master of the fishes when the latter's permission had been secured. Ruth Landes writes that the Ojibway Indian could have "the sturgeon manito" or "the giant Fish" as his personal guardian spirit. "Often associated with misfortune, like all underwater creatures,</page><page sequence="8">8 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 the fish manito nevertheless conferred prowess in netting big, valuable sturgeon, whitefish, and pike, and power for controlling waters. The price of this vision was a tabu on eating fish, usually one kind of fish but sometimes a blanket taboo on all kinds. Infringements were pun- ished supernaturally, even when involuntary" (Landes 1968:26).6 The result of the domination of guardian-spirit beliefs was, of course, that appeals to the fish-spirits were mainly made by those individuals who had them as their protectors. Indeed, offerings to water-sprites among the Ojibway seem to have been made principally by persons who had received visions from them (Landes 1968:31 f.). Before ending this account on Ojibway beliefs we should, perhaps, say some words about another measure to secure fishing luck than appeal to supernatural powers. I refer to magic. The writings of Malinowski and others have demonstrated what a conspicuous part magic has in fishing in various cultures. In North America the Eskimo particularly try to attain rich fishing by wearing amulets and talismans (see e.g. Birket-Smith 1959:169 f.). The Ojibway also had recourse to this form of magic. For instance, they placed "medicine" on the nets to attract fish (Densmore 1929:111, 125). Such magical devices did not supplant the ritual around the lord of fishes, but supplemented it. Fishing was furthermore surrounded by taboos; for instance, one should not catch more fish than one needs when fishing with torch and spear through holes in the ice, or a big snake will appear in the hole [the owner of the fish, apparently] (Jenness 1935:80). Although land animals that had been laid down were pro- pitiated in particular rites known as "animal ceremonialism" (Paulson 1959:184) I have not been able to find corresponding rites around the fish.7 Important as all fishing magic is, it cannot compete in importance with the idea of the owner of the fishes in Ojibway beliefs. 3. Dominant Types of Fish-Owners: A Short Areal Survey The foregoing exposition of beliefs around the Ojibway master of the fishes has demonstrated what different forms and dimensions such a conception may take. To be sure, of course we have not witnessed the whole range of its variations in aboriginal North America. As already pointed out it is impossible to present a complete survey of tribal ideas on the matter in this limited article. However, in order to create a background for a general estimation of the North American concepts I shall here summarize what we know about the main, pre- dominant master-types in different parts of the continent. The survey will be arranged according to culture areas.8 Only a small selection of the materials I have gone over will be reproduced.</page><page sequence="9">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 9 (1) The Eskimo area was a sea-animal hunting area (except along the Yukon and its outlet where fish was the main diet, and among caribou-hunting groups in northern Alaska and west of the Hudson Bay). The most hunted sea-mammal was the seal, and the most well- known of the wild life rulers the "woman down in the depths of the sea," the mistress of the seals. She is best known under the name she bears in Baffinland, Sedna (cf. Boas 1964:175 ff.). Sedna is a complicated character (cf. Hultkrantz 1962:388-97 and Fisher 1975). She was sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes conceived as a seal. She was the mistress of the sea. As a ruler of the seals she kept them back when humans had offended the regulations she had laid down con- cerning the treatment of the dead seals. (She also reacted furiously against transgression of other taboo rules not afflicting animals.) It was then the shaman's task to seek her out and appease her. There were other masters of the sea-animals beside Sedna- in Alaska, for instance, the Moon-man, another complex divinity, and in eastern Labrador Torngarsoak, a huge white bear (Hawkes 1916:124 f.; cf. Holtved 1963). There were also more specialized masters of different species (inua). The owners of land-and sea-animals were of different sexes, a reflex of the religio-magic dualism that existed between land- and sea-animals. (2) The Northwest Coast, a fiord-like landscape at the southern Alaska-western Canada coastline, was the scene of a colorful culture with economic emphais on fishing and sea-mammal hunting. There was here a wealth of spirit-animal conceptions, and true owner-ideas are difficult to identify in the confusing multitude of religious and non-religious notions. When, for instance, the fish and sea-animals are said to be organized in clans under chiefs just like the human beings-an idea also represented among some Southeastern Indians- it is not very clear if the concept of the supernatural master is implied. Furthermore, the boundary-line between the fish and the spirit-fish seems to have been most ambiguous, particularly in the tales. Certainly, most sources from this area are tales, believed in but conventionally embroidered upon (cf. Swanton 1909:25 ff., 50 ff.). Like the Eskimo the Tlingit recognized a supreme ruler of the sea-animals and fishes who was also the goddess of the sea (Swanton 1908:453). The salmon are mentioned as having had a master of their own (Swanton 1909:196 f.). Among the Haida and Tsimshian the master of the killer-whales was also the chief of the dead (Hultkrantz 1957:105 f.). The Kwakiutl knew both specialized fish-masters (of the herring, of the salmon) but also a master of the sea-mammals, the god of the sea (Boas 1935:129, 130), and it seems that the killer-whale provided the fishermen with fish (Boas 1966:165). It is of course difficult to</page><page sequence="10">10 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 generalize since religious conceptions varied from place to place within the tribe; the Kawkiutl of Kitimat, for instance, prayed to the sea- god to send an abundance of fish (Lopatin 1945:61). Among the Bella Coola it was the Supreme Being who was the guardian of the fish (McIlwraith 1948 1:33, 37 f.). As emerges from this short survey North- west Coast Indian ideas on the fish-master were most varied. Before leaving this area it should be mentioned that fish-owner ideas also entered the so-called "first salmon ceremony," the ritual adopted when the seasonal run of salmon appeared. This ceremony also existed in northern California, the Plateau and northernmost Great Basin. It was actually a historically molded form of the common animal ceremonialism, but is interesting from our point of view because the very first fish of the shoal was sometimes thought to be the chief and owner (Gunther 1928:150, Teit 1906:281). As a rule, however, people's prayers were directed not to him but to the Supreme Being. (3) The Plateau Indians, mostly Salish and Shahaptin tribes, had fishing as their most important source of food. The records of super- natural owners of fishes are however surprisingly few. This may be explained by the fact that owner ideas had been integrated with the mighty guardian-spirit complex that was well developed here. According to Teit who investigated the northern Salish cultures certain lakes, or "water mysteries," were supposed to grant success in fishing (Teit 1900:344, 1930:182, 383). I have not been able to record any clear fish-owner beliefs among Shahaptin groups. The Wanapum or Wanapan Shahaptin who had the famous prophet Smohalla as their chief may perhaps be considered an exception. Smohalla said that God had installed the animals and the fish as part of Nature (Mooney 1896:721). If this conviction was not taken from Christian teaching-which is possible-his statement may be read as a proof of God's role as master of the fishes. (4) The Athapascan Indians of the Canadian sub-Arctic lived on a diet of fish and meat. They did not elaborate their fish-owner con- ceptions, if they ever had any; all we know is that tribes like the Coyukon, Sekani, and Kaska had animal "bosses," but no particular bosses of the fish have been mentioned in the literature. (5) The Algonkian Indians of the eastern Canadian sub-Arctic, hunters and fishermen (and rice-gatherers on the southern periphery) had, on the contrary, a rich treasure of master-of-fish conceptions. The Ojibway we have spoken of before belong here. Their northern neighbors, the Cree, thought that a high being-possibly the Supreme Being himself-procured the fish for the fishermen (Cooper 1933:55). The Montagnais-Naskapi on the other hand believed that the master of the fish was a spirit who was responsible to the Supreme Being</page><page sequence="11">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 11 (Flannery 1939:12). Surprisingly, this spirit was imagined as a moose- fly. He had particular control of salmon and cod. Seals and other sea- game lacked supernatural masters (Speck 1935:117 ff.). Among the Micmac the whale was chief of "all life in the sea" (Wallis 1955:106). The Ottawa ideas are difficult to dissociate from those of their closest neighbors, the Ojibway. According to Perrot the Ottawa honored the Great Panther who is said to have been the same as the Missibizi we met among the Ojibway, i.e. a water monster causing good sturgeon- fishing (Perrot 1911:59). (6) In the Eastern Woodlands, Indians of Iroquoian, Algonkian and Siouan stocks cultivated maize at the same time they were hunters and-at least in the north and east-fishermen. Unfortunately we have little knowledge of fish-masters in this early deculturated area except from some tribes around the Great Lakes. The Menomini, for instance, believed that the sun was the master of fishing-probably also of the fish-and made their wishes known to him by raising a painted pole decorated with images of fishing-nets (Skinner 1913:79 f.). The Mohawk master of the fish was a giant fish who could assume human forms at will (Converse 1908:114,116). To the Huron Indians it was the spirit of the water who released the fish for the fisherman (Tooker 1964:64). (7) The Indians of the Southeast represented, until the debacle of the Natchez in the early eighteenth century, outlayers of Meso- American high-culture. Irrespective of their civilizational status they dedicated much time to fishing, particularly along the Gulf coast. Our information on fish-owners derives however from inland tribes.9 For instance, the Cherokee prayed to the fairy-like "water-dwellers" to give fish, and in one river there lived a monster-fish that was considered "the father of all the fish" (Mooney 1900:334,307). (8) On the Prairies and the Plains and in the Great Basin, all dry areas, particularly the High Plains and the Basin, the more or less nomadic Indians paid little attention to fishing. Only in the north- eastern periphery do we hear of fish-owners: the Plains Ojibway kept the belief in the Great Panthers, "masters of all underwater creatures and also snakes" (Howard 1965:92 f.). It is however possible that a more intensive research into the enormous literature on these areas can reveal further materials. (9) Also the Southwestern desert cultures have functioned in a very dry surrounding; the high standard of Pueblo civilization was mainly due to an effective use of water resources and irrigation. Apache- Navajo nomads and Pima-Papago villagers had some recourse to fishing, but the best fishing area was the western Mexican coastline. The major ethnic population there was the Cahita Indians. They embraced the idea that the "water old woman" with webbed fingers</page><page sequence="12">12 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 ruled the fish and seals and eagerly watched over their treatment by the fishermen (Beals 1943:19). There are also other reports on fish- owners among north-western Mexican groups. (10) The hunters, gatherers and fishermen of California had their cultures virtually destroyed at the middle of the last century, and not much of their ancient religious systems is known today. However, there is no doubt that masters of the fish were part of their religious creeds in spots, in particular in the salmon-fishing north-western corner and along the coast. The Yuki knew a fish-owner, a beautiful, long-haired woman, who kept her clients away from the humans, whom she never helped (Foster 1944:205 f.). The Pomo believed that rivers and lakes were the property of a water spirit; the fishes were his children (Loeb 1926:302, 313). The Wappo had the idea that Old Man Coyote sent the fish to the fisherman (Driver 1936:217). It seems that the Chumash of the Santa Barbara Channel had some belief in the swordfish as a master of the whales, a belief that was re-enacted in a ritual swodfish dance (Mohr and Sample 1955, Grant 1978:526; cf. Bauer 1968:127). 4. Phenomenological and Historical Considerations The wild growth of master ideas around the fish and other marine and aquatic beings may at first seem rather confused; however, the bewildering variety may be subjected to a systematic re-ordering according to phenomenological principles.'0 Indeed, in some cases it is possible to trace far-reaching connections between forms of the master concept and draw historical conclusions. The true importance of the idea of the master of the fish is difficult to grasp after this investigation, however. The fish-owner must be seen in a wider context, together with the master of the game animals. The great and decisive problems of the ruler-concept unfold only in this larger perspective. It is therefore not possible to discuss them in this preliminary account. Our phenomenological analysis could appropriately begin with a typology of concepts. The most elementary idea seems to be that the fish-owner is the first fish in a shoal, as was sometimes the case in the salmon ceremonial complex on the Northwest Coast and in adjoining regions. The next level is represented by the owner of a particular species, a concept that is clearly pronounced among the Eskimo, Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, Naskapi, Ojibway and Menomini- in other words, within areas rich in notions of masters of the fish or seals. Then there is the general owner of fish, which is the conception most generally met with; in maritime areas he (or she) may be identical with the master of the sea-mammals, in particular the seals. This</page><page sequence="13">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 13 generalized owner could be a fish but also another being, animal or semi-human; in some cases he is the lord of the sea (Tlingit, Kwakiutl, Bella Coola), a lake (Thompson) or "the water" (Huron, Pomo). Among the Quinault and the Ottawa there was talk of the dead as the master of the fish. In several instances prayers were directed to the Supreme Being to grant the fisherman a harvest of fish. We may mention here the southern Northwest Coast tribes in connection with salmon catching, the Menomini, and possibly the Cree. Perhaps the Wappo Old Man Coyote could also be included here. Among the Bella Coola, known for their towering high-god idea, the Supreme Being was actually the master of the fish. In the other cases, however, he was probably not the regular master but the utmost helper in times of want and hunger." There is no need to look for a stratification of concepts here. It is an established fact that many North American Indian religions are split up in segments or configurations of beliefs which are actualized alternately. Thus, in certain situations the Supreme Being may stand for fishing as a part of the pursuits of existence, in other situations the fish-owner fills this function as a more specialized representative of the supernatural world (cf. Hultkrantz 1971). As remarked upon earlier, a hierarchy of master spirits could possibly be a late phenomenon among the Ojibway. In any case, recent sources assert that the Supreme Being controlled the master spirit both among the Ojibway and the Naskapi. These cases are exceptions, however; in general there was no obvious link between the high-god and the fish-owner. There remains nevertheless the possibility that our conclusion is based on incomplete materials. The Ojibway and Naskapi master-spirit ideas are the best known of all in North America, in fact. The appearance of the master spirit varied. Very often he is de- scribed as a giant fish, as among the Tlingit, Micmac, Ojibway and Mohawk for example. The Lillooet said he was a humpback salmon, the Cherokee that he was a monster-fish, and the Tarahumara (in Mexico) that he was the elder of his kind. On the other hand, the Nootka and Naskapi believed that he was extremely small, and a different kind of zoomorphical being. In some places the spirit had a white color that set it apart from the common species, thus among the Eskimo (Torngarsoak), Coast Salish and Ojibway. We notice that sometimes the outer appearance of the master spirit oscillated between man and fish (or seal), as examples from the Eskimo and Mohawk show. This is a convincing proof of the spiritual nature of the owner of the fish. When we hear that the master of the fish might be killed- as was the case among the Nootka-this points to a natural attraction</page><page sequence="14">14 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 between the ideas of the fish and of their master, thought to represent them all. The boundary-line between the supernatural owner and the fish is sometimes most vague, as examples from for instance the Sekani, Ojibway and Pomo could demonstrate. We must not expect however a too rigid and logical line between them. As just mentioned the master spirit is in some cases a being belonging to another species than that of the fish. It was represented as a bear among some Eskimo, a killer-whale among the Kwakiutl, a crab among the Nootka, a fly among the Naskapi, a whale among the Micmac, and possibly a swordfish (as owner of the whales) among the Chumash. Here again one could expect that a more powerful animal would have appeared as a master, and in the main this was certainly the case; but there were as we see examples to the contrary. In some instances the owner took on anthropomorphic features: Sedna among the Eskimo (although occasionally conceived of as a seal), the Wasco spirit (presumably more a guardian of the fishermen, however), the Coos mermaid and the beautiful woman of the Yuki. It is interesting to note that only this last category of owners was thought to be female; all other instances portray or seem to understand tacitly a male owner. By its functions the supernatural owner of the fish ought to be kept apart from other supernatural beings. He protects his fishes or seals, and takes measures against those fishermen who violate against the rules he has laid down (cf. examples from the Eskimo, Kwakiutl, Lillooet, Naskapi and Cahita). One of the most important functions is to counteract tendencies among fishermen to exhaust the supply of fish through ruthless fishing-a real ecological function. The Yuki ruler of the fish was said to impede fishing, whereas her Wasco colleague possibly protected the fishermen more than the fish. The fish-owner might be represented by the god of the sea, as we have seen, or occasionally by a water-monster (Ojibway, Ottawa, Plains Ojibway); however, as a rule the latter type of supernatural beings belongs in a category of its own (cf. Alexander 1916:274). Water- monsters looking like horned snakes, panthers or buffaloes and involved in an eternal conflict with thunderbirds occur in folk beliefs over most parts of North America except, perhaps, in the far north. There are many genii of the waters who do not appear as masters of the fish. There are also mermaids with fish-tails, as among the Ojibway (Jenness 1935:43), the Shoshoni of Wyoming (Hultkrantz Ms.), the Yavapai of the Southwest (Gifford 1932:233), and the Yokuts of California (Count Ms.). They may have European origins. We are little informed of offerings and other rituals performed for the supernatural owners of the fish. A Kwakiutl who went for fishing threw mountain-goat tallow and a piece of diorite to the killer-</page><page sequence="15">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 15 whale; the Thompson Indian women painted their faces red as an offering to the powers sending fish; the Ojibway sacrificed red cloths, and the Huron tobacco. It is said that the Cahita formerly offered tobacco and children; if this is true it was certainly due to Mexican high-culture influences. Ceremonies and ritual pantomines to ensure good fishing, directed to the water spirit, are reported from the Central Eskimo, the Menomini and the Chumash. Stone figures representing the fish-owner which could receive offerings are known from the Upper Skagit of Washington and possibly the Yurok of California (Collins 1974:212, Powers 1877:57). The distribution of fish-owner ideas in aboriginal North America suggests certain far-reaching connections and, by inference, certain temporary perspectives. The most obvious diffusion of concepts has taken place along the coasts. The mistress of the seals was widely known in the Arctic and North Pacific. She was a prominent spirit among many tribes of Northeast Asia, and she was the dominant deity among the Eskimo and the Indians of the Northwest Coast. (Here, as among the Coast Salish, she was sometimes supplanted by a male sea-owner.) Sur- prisingly, she turned up again among the Mexican Cahita. The diffusion of the seal-woman concept coincides with the expansion of the North Pacific maritime culture some 4000 years ago (Hultkrantz 1965:290 f.). On the North American continent proper the focus of the fish- owner concept was with the North Algonkian groups: the Ojibway, Ottawa and Naskapi. The lack of data from the Athapascan area is possibly due to late ethnographic recording, possibly to the alienships of the Athapascans in their environment (they are comparatively late immigrants from Asia). In western Canada as a whole other religious beliefs, such as notions of cannibal ogres and wild bush-men of super- natural quality, have meant more to the aboriginal population than the owner concepts. It may seem more enigmatic why the intensely fishing Plateau tribes have not contributed more data. It was earlier pointed out however that in this area the guardian-spirit complex, perhaps the most vigorous expression of North American Indian religion (cf. Ben- edict 1923), had absorbed the master-spirit conceptions. It is obvious that the same thing happened among the Coast Salish and even among the Ojibway. As we go further south the guardian-spirit beliefs seem to have more or less supplanted the beliefs in fish-owners. It is also evident that wherever agriculture has been introduced the data on master spirits are scant. This could not altogether depend on the absence of</page><page sequence="16">16 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 source-materials that certainly obscures our knowledge about some of the tribes. Agricultural preoccupations, calendar ceremonialism and the quest for personal guardian spirits have eclipsed old beliefs centered on fishing. In some areas- particularly along the western coasts, and in the lake districts north of the Great Lakes-the supernatural ruler of the fishes has survived in folk religon up to our own time. Indeed, among the Cahita the owners of land and sea animals have survived better than other pagan spirits (Beals 1943:60). It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that their integration with the ecological pattern has been decisive for this situation. We shall now turn to the important problem of the impact of ecology on our subject. 5. The Ecological Perspective In all its manifestations the concept of the supernatural owner of the fishes corresponds to the ecological integration of the culture and religion to which it belongs. It is a case of "primary integration" within the religio-ecological model as conceived by me in earlier writings (cf. e.g. Hultkrantz 1974:4). The fish-owner and the rites around him "are, as it were, part of the subsistence activities" (ibidem). The immediate question is, of course, do such beings only exist where fishing occurs? To put it very simply, do we not find them wherever people have seen fish? We shall here investigate the ecological pre- suppositions a little more closely. First of all it should be remembered that sea-mammal hunting has been included in this article together with fishing, for practical reasons. Sea-mammals were (formerly) in great abundance in the northern waters, and the lack of othersuitable food made them therefore important in adjoining coast cultures. Whales, for instance, were hunted by the Eskimo, Tlingit and Nootka. Seals were one of the main diets here but also further south along the Pacific coast (Driver and Massey 1957:176, 187-89). Sea-mammals were the staple food in the coastal Eskimo area (Driver and Massy 1957:177 map 4). This was also, as we have seen, the area where the mothers of seals ranked as an im- portant goddess-perhaps more important than any other Eskimo divinity. The correlation between sea-hunting and the owner idea is obvious here. Fish was available all along the coasts, in the Yukon drainage, the Plateau river area, and in the lower St. Lawrence and Mississippi river areas. The average annual production per square mile has been estimated as 800-1000 pounds in these regions. In the Great Lakes area, and in the immediate southern neighborhood-thus, the area</page><page sequence="17">HULTKRANTZ: WATER SPRITES 17 occupied by Ojibway and Central Algonkian groups-there was also access to fish, but half as much. It is interesting to find that in most of interior Canada there were only small quantities of fish available (Driver and Massey 1957:202 map 24). If, now, we compare the above feature with the occurrence of fishing we find that fishing was the dominant mode of subsistence in the Yukon valley and along the North Pacific coast, on the Plateau, in the Bear Lake, Slave Lake and Lake Winnipeg areas, around Sault Ste. Marie, along stretches of the Atlantic coast, in southern Florida, along the Gulf coast, and in the Santa Barbara area (California) (Driver and Massey 157:176-78; cf. also Rostlund 1952). In many other areas fishing existed as a secondary form of subsistence (cf. e.g. Kroeber 1939:146), but was lacking in large parts of interior western North America. It is clear that the practice of fishing prevailed in the main where there was plenty of fish (cf. Driver and Massey 1957:202, maps 23 and 24). There were important exceptions to this rule, however. There was little fish available in the Canadian sub-Arctic, the above-mentioned lake areas disregarded; still, Athapascans and Algonkians pursued fishing with emphasis here. There is little doubt that the historical cultural pattern dictated the leaning towards this occupation. The very fact that our most detailed information on fish-owners derives from this area-compare Ojibway and Naskapi-underlines the im- portance of the fishing economy for the growth of this concept. (The peculiar absence of fish-owner beliefs among the Athapascans was discussed under the foregoing heading.) Another exceptional case: there was little fishing done in the dry parts of the continent, as has been pointed out above. Indeed, some Plains tribes and some Pueblos had taboos against fishing, this being seemingly a cultural reflex of the natural situation (cf. Wissler 1950:6, 16). However, even where fish abounded in the Plains area, as in the Blackfoot country, the Indians avoided catching them unless food from land animals was not at hand (Wissler 1910:20 f., Grinnell 1962:207). Traditional food habits and patterns of taste decided the choice. The interesting thing is now that there are no signs that the Blackfoot had nourished the belief in fish-owners. They conceived of a water-monster in the form of a plumed snake (Wissler 1912:238 f.). This being was, however, as we have seen, part of a widely diffused mythical pattern in North America, and was as a rule not connected with the supernatural master of the fishes. Other similar cases could be adduced. I think we can safely say that, even if our knowledge of the occurrence and cultural integration of the supernatural fish-owner is uneven and patchy, this concept was</page><page sequence="18">18 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 present only where a fishing economy existed. Conversely, this does not mean that fishing tribes always manifested the belief in fish- owners. Take, for instance, the Shoshoni Indians in Wyoming. They used to catch fish in the mountain streams with spears and nets, a secondary mode of subsistence. However, they had no supernatural rulers of the fish. Their waters were populated by water-babies and water-buffaloes which had nothing to do with the fish (Hultkrantz Ms.). It is probable that the little developed aquatic master concept among these Shoshoni is related to the fact that their economy was originally less concerned with fishing (see Hultkrantz 1962a:216).12 Certainly there was no cultural tradition putting weight on fishing. The result we arrive at is that the concept of the master of the fish was stimulated by fishing in aboriginal North America. It would have been more prominent than it was had not vision quest and belief in personal guardian spirits, as well as spiritual absorption by ag- ricultural ceremonialism, displaced it in large areas. NOTES 1. This "Jonah story" is known among the Northern Algonkian groups, the Men- omini and the Atsina (Gros Ventre) of the Plains (cf. Fisher 1946:239, 240). 2. See e.g. the reflections on this subject in Johansons 1968:27 ff. and Liungman 1958:184 ff. 3. The reader should be aware that the Ojibway reside in a large area north of the Great Lakes. Our sources refer to different villages and bands. Folk beliefs in one place do not necessarily coincide with those of another place. 4. The snake causes the water to circulate; cf. Coleman 1937:40. 5. Thwaites 1896-1901 L:328. This interpretation is rejected and a correct opinion on Michibichi is made in van Deursen 1931:43 note 3. 6. The water sprite appears, as also Levi-Strauss admits, in Ojibway clan totemism (cf. Levi-Strauss 1965:31, Hultkrantz 1972:223 f.). 7. Among the neighboring Ottawa-who sometimes are counted as Ojibway- people were careful not to burn the bones of the fish. If they did the souls of the fish were offended and would cease to come into the nets (Kenton 1954:322, cf. Frazer 1955:250). 8. The range of culture areas in North America varies with different authors (Wissler, Kroeber, Murdock, Driver, Tschopik, N11le and others). The present author is responsible for the following classification. 9. I refrain from quoting here, as I did when discussing the Northwest Coast Indians, examples of the clan organization and chieftainships ascribed to animals. 10. For the concept of phenomenology used here, cf. Hultkrantz 1970:68-88. 11. This is a common idea in North America, that the Supreme Being interferes in individual cases when a serious crisis is at hand. 12. One Shoshoni group, the Sheepeaters, is excluded from this consideration. REFERENCES Alexander, Hartley Burr 1916 North American Mythology.
