<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Collins "Where All the Ground Is Friendly": Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation in Willa s Cather's My Antonia The relatively treeless North American plains offer little in the way of shelter at ground level. Consequently, a wide range of native animals including badgers, prairie dogs, snakes, moles, and even owls have evolved to make their homes beneath the surface of the earth, carving out burrows, dens, and tunnels tinder the tall prairie grasses. Humans, too, have long responded to the ecological conditions of the prairie biome by constructing earth-dwellings for shelter. By the time of Willa Cather's 1883 arrival in Nebraska, Pawnee earth lodges were well established in the region where the Cather family settled. Circular, with sunken floors and softly mounded roofs covered in vegetation, these semi-subterranean dwellings were the highly specialized culmination of a millennium of experimentation with "timber-frame, earth-covered dwellings" and represented the most advantageous combination of bioregionally available construction materials, longevity, and insulation from extreme temperatures (Roper and Pauls 28). The flood of nineteenth-century European set- tlers took their cue from the prairie's existing earth dwellers and quickly erected a network of sod houses, dugouts, and half-dugouts on their newly claimed homesteads. The proliferation of earth dwellings in Willa Cather's 1918 novel, My Antonia- in the form of burrows, tunnels, dugouts, and Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 19.1 (Winter 2012) Advance Access publication March 1, 2012 doi:10.1093/isle/iss004 © The Author(s) 2012.

It seems clear that one prairie-specific knowledge-set is architectural: the prairie biome produces a number of domiciles that are subterranean, efficient, and bioregionally unique. Cather's own interest in bio- regionally appropriate construction has been noted by critics like Guy Reynolds, who compares the architectural imaginations of Cather and Frank Lloyd Wright, noting that both are concerned with creating "spaces and places harmonized with local environments" (176). Reynolds concludes that the "human spaces of Cather's prairie novels tend to be low-lying if not subterranean. They merge or fuse with the land" (177). Such bioregional fusion would seem to exem- plify the practice Greg Garrard has described as "coming to dwell on the earth in a relation of duty and responsibility" in which humans understand the "long-term imbrication" of cultural and natural forms and modulate their behavior accordingly (108).1 Of course, the story of European settlers does not end with the construction of earth-sheltered homes. The settlers, including those fictionalized in My Antonia , replace their bioregionally native earth dwellings with imported European-style timber architecture as quickly as they possibly can. Joseph Meeker sees such priorities as evidence that My Antonia espouses a commitment to "development" over environment in which ecological priorities are reduced to non-concerns and the "land fulfills its destiny" through being pro- ductively put to human uses (88). Patrick Dooley reaches similar con- clusions, arguing that My Antonia subscribes to an ethic of "homocentric conservation" in which the prairie environment is valued insofar as it is an "instrument in the service of human prerog- atives" which themselves are developed to further social and eco- nomic aims rather than ecological ones (68). At this point, it is useful to remember the distinction that Glen Love has drawn between "ego-consciousness" that focuses critical attention on human activity and "eco-consciousness" that recognizes the complexity and subtlety of the non-human world (230). I argue that My Antonia narrativizes precisely this tension between eco- consciousness and ego-consciousness as it depicts a frontier family continually alternating between developing a sincere regard for the processes of the non-human world, and deploying what Steven Baker has called a "rhetoric of animality" as a weapon against immi- grant families whose habitations resemble those of nonhumans. This dynamic forms the heart of what I call the "ethic of cultivation" that structures the Burden family's ambivalent relationship to the natural</page><page sequence="3">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 45 world. This ethic of cultivation operates on two levels. First, it works at the level of horticulture and leads the Burdens to strongly prefer and value cultivated, tamed, and altered environments over so-called "unimproved" land. Secondly, the novel's ethic of cultivation also works at the level of cultural refinement, positioning those who have strongly internalized classed behavioral codes as superior to others who lack such social cultivation. This dual valence of the meaning of "cultivation" is particularly important as it communicates the complex ways in which the novel continually slides between environ- mental and social registers in its representation of the means by which value judgments are made on the prairie. In the process of analyzing the novel's environmental imagination, this essay proceeds according to the ecological critical method that Cheryl Glotfelty foundationally defines as addressing "the intercon- nections between human culture and the material world, between the human and the nonhuman" (28). More specifically, this essay takes up Simon Estok's recent challenge concerning ecocriticism's "lack of an adequate vocabulary for prejudice and bias against the natural world" (207). This essay contributes to the development of such a vocabulary through unpacking the logic by which characters in Cather's novel both perceive and value the categories of culture/ nature and human/nonhuman, which Cather renders through an extensive index of earth dwellings. The spectrum of underground shelters in My Antonia , then, offers a remarkable opportunity to trace the vexed environmental outlook that structures Mrs. Burden's judg- ments about her immigrant neighbors and leads her to condemn in humans the very traits that she appreciates in other animals.2 Animal Holes Understood by many as a gentle elegy for the frontier-era prairie, My Antonia fictionalizes various elements of Willa Cather's own nineteenth-century childhood on the Nebraska plains. Episodic in form, the novel is divided into five segments, each focused on a dif- ferent* phase of Jim Burden's life: his childhood on the family farm, his teenage years in the town of Black Hawk, his college years in Lincoln, his brief return to the prairie after graduating from college, and his final visit to Ántonia's prosperous farm twenty years later. The novel's elaborate introductory frame establishes the entire narra- tive as a manuscript written by Jim in order to preserve the memories of his frontier youth, particularly as they gather around Antonia Shimerda, his childhood friend, and the complex issues the Burdens</page><page sequence="4">46 ISLE face as they strive to succeed, settled in amongst the burrows and dugouts of their animal and human neighbors. One of the manuscript's first episodes suggests that burrows and their inhabitants are not inherently repugnant to Mrs. Burden, which she demonstrates to Jim in her kitchen garden on the day following his arrival. After leading him through the tall grass, she points toward the garden's edge and admonishes, "don't be scared if you see anything look out of that hole in the bank over there. That's a badger hole." She explains that even though the badger persists in killing her chickens she is willing to sacrifice an occasional hen in order to retain the badger's company. "I like to have him come out and watch me when I'm at work," she tells Jim, explaining that, "in a new country a body feels friendly to the animals" (19). Articulating this sense of friendship for the natural world she takes leave of Jim, who immediately reclines in front of the entrance to the badger-hole. Lingering on the patch of soil and basking in the afternoon sun, Jim notes, "the earth was warm under me, and warm as I crumbled it through my fingers." The longer he remains sitting the more he feels like he is one of the sun-warmed pumpkins against which he leans. "I was entirely happy" he recalls, and asserts that he felt himself "to be dissolved into something complete and great" (20). Sitting at the door of the badger hole, Jim strongly identifies with the elements of the natural world and he experiences a gradual dissolution of the perceptual barriers that normally lead him to differentiate himself from his environment, and instead experiences communion with nature. The badger hole is not the only animal burrow Jim discovers. He quickly becomes aware of a number of different underground domi- ciles, all of which he finds endlessly fascinating. The "earth-owls," for example, regularly lure him north of his family's farm where he watches them as they "come flying home at sunset and disappear under the earth" to their underground nests. His wonder is tinged with mourning as he concludes that "winged things" who would live underground "must be rather degraded creatures" (28). Nonetheless, he is sure that the owl burrows must be pleasant places, calling them "comfortable houses" (28) and believing them to be "lined with feathers" (39) in ways that recall the down-filled pillows that line his own comfortable bed. The owls situate their nests among a ten-acre maze of holes and tunnels that form one vast prairie dog community. The dog-town fas- cinates Jim, who notes that the holes themselves are arranged "with a good deal of regularity, almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues." The seemingly rational organization of the</page><page sequence="5">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 47 town leads him to believe that "an orderly and very sociable kind of life was going on there" (40). Jim's attribution of order to the prairie dogs is an instance of the kind of anthropomorphism Kate Soper has suggested is driven by the desire to "show our affection for animals through allowing them to share a human 'life' and our fondness for ourselves in projecting onto them the feelings we deem exclusive to us" (83). When Jim describes the dogs themselves as "sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses," it is as though they are humans enjoying a leisurely afternoon lounging on their verandas (40). Jim regularly visits the dog town with Antonia and it is here, at the entrance to another animal burrow, that he again has a pro- foundly transformative experience. As he bends over to examine a particularly large tunnel he suddenly hears Antonia shout out a warning behind him and he whirls to confront a rattlesnake. Presumably, the snake that sits coiled on a gravel patch among the prairie dog holes has been drawn to the site for many of the same reasons Jim and Antonia have: it plans to explore the holes in search of puppies and eggs. Jim interrupts its repose but after quickly strik- ' ing the snake dead he loses control of himself and senselessly beats its body into a bloody, oozing pulp on the ground. Long after Jim has "pounded his ugly head flat" he continues to strike merely "from hate."3 Far from being horrified at the brutality of this incident, however, Jim and Antonia both recognize it as a coming-of-age moment and Antonia admiringly declares that the killing has made Jim "just like big mans" (41). Adult masculinity, it seems, is inti- mately connected to the violent domination of the natural world. Such domination continues to be played out decades later in Jim's adult relationship to the environment. Having moved on from rela- tively small prairie dog and earth-owl holes, an adult Jim finances the creation of much bigger and more ecologically troubling holes in the ground through oil drilling and mining. Jim nurtures such endeavors as part of his "big Western dreams" which bring him the same sort of satisfaction that exploring the animal burrows of his youth did (4). The Shimerda Dugout One of the novel's most vexing questions is why none of the posi- tive associations Jim makes between order, comfort, and the animal burrows of his youth are carried through to his assessment of the Shimerda dugout. The dugout is continually rendered in the same language as the animal burrows but is also emphatically marked with disgust. Grandmother Burden repeatedly condemns the</page><page sequence="6">48 ISLE Shimerda dugout by declaring that it is "no better than a badger hole" and she asserts that a "cave" is no place for the Shimerdas to spend the winter- assuming, of course, that they are "nice people" (22). Indeed, Louise Westling points to the correlation between animal burrows and the Shimerda dugout, observing that "involve- ment with the earth is paradoxically a source of strength and a bru- talizing, coarsening, dehumanizing experience" for the Shimerda family who are consequently "seen as degraded and bestial" because of their connection to the earth (74). Despite the fact that Jim has characterized the underground owl nests as "comfortable houses" (28) and the prairie dog tunnels as "sheltered home[s]," (43) his narration of the Shimerda dugout care- fully avoids the language of comfort, home, or architecture. Instead, he and his grandmother both relentlessly use the language of a degraded animality to describe the Shimerda dugout. When the Burdens arrive at the Shimerda homestead for the first time, for example, they note that Antonia "start [s] at a run for the hole in the bank" into which she disappears (59). When her father emerges moments later, he too comes out of "the hole in the bank" (24). Upon entering the dugout themselves, Jim and his grandmother find that not only is it "very dark" but the "air in the cave was stifling" and unpleasant (60). Once winter sets in and the Shimerdas1 desperate poverty makes it impossible for them to brave the weather outside their home (as they all share a single coat and ineffectively wrap their feet in rags), Otto Fuchs observes in bewilderment that they "stick in that hole in the bank like badgers" (58). Fuchs's ill-concealed baffle- ment along with the novel's persistent negative comparison of the Shimerdas to animals ultimately functions, in Steve Baker's words, to "convey a sense of their distance, strangeness and difference" in order to discredit or demean the immigrant family (108). In stark con- trast to Jim's union with nature at the badger hole in his grand- mother's garden, the similarity of the Shimerda dugout to a badger hole is reason enough for Jim and his grandmother to condemn the immigrant family's domicile. A primary motivation for such condem- nations is, according to Soper, to "preserve the culture-nature barrier," for to be aligned with animals "is precisely to be 'brutal': to betray what is proper to humanity," which is clearly the Burdens' understanding of the situation (86). One reason for the Burdens' disapproval of the Shimerda dugout, then, is that the Burdens are strongly invested in establishing and maintaining a rigid differentiation between human and nonhuman animal life, and between humans and their environment. The primary difference, after all, between the Burden and Shimerda</page><page sequence="7">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 49 farms, which are both covered in the same softly waving wine- colored grass, is that only the Shimerda homestead is called a "wild place," by which the Burdens mean there is "no garden or chicken- house, and very little broken land" (21). In other words, the novel outlines an agricultural ethic of cultivation in which domesticating animals, constructing shelter, and planting crops constitute the differ- ence between human civilization and animal wildness.4 As the narra- tive progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the Burdens do not understand the similarity of the Shimerda dugout and the badger burrow to be neutral. Instead, their repeated references to the animal- like domicile and habits of the Shimerdas are intended to mark the dugout as a site of disgust in sharp contrast to the positive associa- tions the Burdens have with actual badger holes and other under- ground animal dens. There are, however, a number of passages in which the Burdens' desire to differentiate between humans and nonhumans is blurred- such as when Mrs. Burden identifies the chicken-killing badger in her garden as a friendly and desired companion or when Jim says that trees are "so rare in that country" that the settlers "feel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons" (28). In fact, the Burdens regularly engage in anthropomorphism through repeatedly using the architectural term "house" and the traffic term "highway" to refer to the owl and prairie dog burrows. Conversely, they also reg- ularly engage in the beastialization of the Shimerdas through repeat- edly referring to their dugout as a "hole in the bank" and a "badger hole." This dual transposition of human and animal traits and habits makes clear that the Burdens are willing and able to blur the distinc- tions between human and animal habitation when it does not threaten the hierarchy established by the ethic of cultivation. The ulti- mate effect of the Burdens' desire to differentiate between human and nonhuman habits, however, is to repeatedly devalue the natural world through articulating classed and nativist hostility toward the Shimerdas by likening them to prairie animals. The behavior of the Shimerda children regularly deconstructs the binary oppositions between humans and their environment that the Burdens wish to establish. Antonia, for example, sees her own body as a friendly and suitable environment for the "palest, frailest" grass- hopper she cradles in the "warm nest" of her cupped hands and then carefully deposits in her hair for its protection and warmth (34-5). Her sister Yulka happily curls up "like a baby rabbit" in a nest the children have fashioned in the tall grass (25). Some time later, when Mr. Shimerda sadly shows Mrs. Burden that Antonia and Yulka sleep in "another little cave" that is "not much bigger than an oil barrel,</page><page sequence="8">50 ISLE scooped out in the black earth" of the dugout's back wall, Jim and his grandmother are horrified. Mr. Shimerda himself can only gesture toward the alcove and murmur the names of his children in a "low, despairing voice." But, like Susan Rosowski who argues that in this scene "the earth seems nature's womb" (88) for the young girls, Antonia resists a negative reading of her little cave-within-a-cave, insisting to the frowning adults that it is "warm like the badger hole."5 Eagerly asserting, "I like for sleep there," Antonia points toward a feather-bed and describes her own little feather-lined burrow in terms that recall the cozy and comfortable feather-lined homes that Jim imagines for the earth owls as they retire to their dens in the golden light of late afternoon (61). Subterranean Kitchens In contrast to the Shimerda "badger hole," the Burdens live in a "white frame house" proudly rising one-and-a-half stories above the ground and which, outside a handful in the nearby Norwegian settle- ment, is the "only wooden house west of Black Hawk" (17). Tucked into a warm bed near a bright window on the second floor, Jim is first welcomed to his new home by his grandmother who says "you come on down to the kitchen with me, and have a nice warm bath behind the stove" (14). The phrase "down to the kitchen" rings strange in his ears, and indeed, as he follows his grandmother down a flight of stairs he is surprised to find that her cozy kitchen is buried within the earth, underneath the timber-framed portion of the house. Significantly, like the Shimerda home, Mrs. Burden's kitchen is liter- ally a hole in the ground. It is, in fact, the dugout in which the Burdens lived when they first started farming in Nebraska, but with important differences: it has been carefully cultivated, ordered, and domesticated in order to separate it from the dusty dimness of animal burrows. Unlike the cave-like darkness and dirt of the Shimerda dugout, Mrs. Burden's cozy kitchen is continually narrated as a bright and pleasant place. Instead of black, crumbling earth, Grandmother Burden's kitchen walls are "plastered and whitewashed- the plaster laid directly on the earth walls" (14). The floor has been leveled and cemented, while high on the walls near the ceiling are a number of small, glass "half windows" framed by fresh white curtains, and filled with cheerful potted geraniums. In contrast to the stifling, stuffy air of the Shimerda cave, Mrs. Burden's subterranean kitchen is filled with the "pleasant smell of gingerbread baking" (15). While the only light in the Shimerda cave comes from a lantern which "threw</page><page sequence="9">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 51 out a feeble yellow glimmer" (60), the Burden kitchen is flooded with warming natural sunlight that shines "through the west half- window" upon a large cat who lazily suns himself and rubs against the furniture (15). The Burden kitchen may be a hole in the ground, but it is no cave, no badger-hole. The pleasantness of the Burdens' own subterranean living quar- ters is crucial because it, along with the Burdens' positive perceptions of animal burrows, establishes one unspoken reason for Jim's and his grandmother's disgust at the Shimerda dugout: they believe that Mrs. Shimerda herself is to blame. The problem is not that earth dwelling is inherently unfit for human habitation, for structurally the Burden kitchen is not particularly different from the Shimerda home. What is different is that the Burden dugout has been tamed and controlled with plaster, ornamental plants, and fresh curtains. In the eyes of Jim and his grandmother, the problem is that Mrs. Shimerda has not adequately civilized her family's dugout as a human habitation or differentiated it from an animal burrow. Mrs. Shimerda's deficient cultivation is explicitly confirmed much later, when Jim learns that in the old country the grasping and greedy Mrs. Shimerda had been merely "a poor girl come in to do the work" in the home of Ántonia's father's well-to-do family (180). These classed origins persist in Jim's narration of Mr. and Mrs. Shimerda's presence in the dugout: while Mrs. Shimerda speaks in an "envious, complaining tone" (73) and possesses a "sharp chin and shrewd little eyes" (23), her husband is continually depicted as gra- cious, refined, and utterly incongruous with the conditions in his family's dugout. Everything about him stands in stark contrast to the hole in the bank, from "his dignified manner" to the "silk scarf of a dark bronze-green, carefully crossed and held together by a red coral pin" he wears in place of a collar, to his "white and well-shaped" hands (24). His own classed cultivation is out of place in the dugout, which suggests, according to Jim's narration, that cultivation entails a deliberate and profound separation from the natural environment. The Shimerda dugout, figured as animal den, becomes the site within which judgment and social domination are enacted and exacted by Mrs. Burden. The badger-like nature of their dugout is mobilized as the environmental pretext by which Mrs. Shimerda's lack of cultiva- tion is critiqued on a social front. According to Grandmother Burden, Mrs. Shimerda is not merely complaining, grasping, and thoroughly unpleasant, she simply does not make an effort to establish basic components of a working farm- she has no hens to provide either eggs or meat for her family. Knowing that the Shimerdas are suffering, Mrs. Burden visits them</page><page sequence="10">52 ISLE with much-needed provisions as winter falls. When Mrs. Burden arrives with Jim, the hired hand Jake, and a hamper full of food for the Shimerdas, she does not immediately make it known that she has brought assistance, for the groaning hamper remains in the wagon for Jake to carry in once he has unhitched the horse. Of course, as soon as Mrs. Shimerda sees Mrs. Burden's wagon pull up, she is wild with eagerness for the aid she knows Mrs. Burden has surely brought. When she realizes that Mrs. Burden's arms are empty, however, Mrs. Shimerda becomes distraught and begins, "talking very fast in her own language . . . and looking about accusingly at every one" as if to blame the family's miserable situation on the visit- ing Americans. Mrs. Shimerda reproaches Mrs. Burden by "snatch [ing] off the covers of two barrels behind the door" to show the Burdens the tiny pile of frozen rotting potatoes in one and a sparse handful of flour in the other (59). She waves an empty coffee can in Mrs. Burden's face and begins to behave hysterically, unable to understand why the Burdens have not brought help her family so obviously needs. The difference between the Burdens' abundance and Shimerda's privation is represented, as Roger Welsch and Linda Welsch have documented, as profoundly moral, for Cather's fiction regularly mobilizes both food and kitchens as value markers of things and people "that are good and bad" (12). In fact, Grandmother Burden is disgusted enough at Mrs. Shimerda's desperate and grasping behavior that she does nothing to reassure the immigrant woman. Instead, she simply murmurs softly in faux-embarrassment and continues making pleasantries "in her polite Virginia way, not admitting their stark need or her own [appa- rent] remissness." Minutes later when Jake enters the dugout with the hamper in tow, Mrs. Shimerda realizes her mistake and Jim describes how "the poor woman broke down" crying bitterly (60). Mrs. Burden's pretense of not having brought help deliberately encourages the scene in which the indigent immigrant woman falsely accuses her of being ungenerous. When her mistake is revealed, Mrs. Shimerda must fall to her knees, crying out an apology in relief and shame while Mrs. Burden calmly distributes the food that will save the family from going hungry. Some time later Jim makes it clear that he has internalized the power of his grandmother's "polite Virginia way," when he ruminates on the perpetual dependency of his grand- parents' two farmhands, noting that "these boys had no practised manner behind which they could retreat and hold people at a dis- tance" as his grandmother can (69). While Mrs. Burden delivers her aid to the Shimerdas in a way that forcefully asserts her sense of her own superior cultivation, her interaction with the Shimerdas</page><page sequence="11">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 53 underscores the relationship between an ethic of cultivation and a culture of domination. The Making of Friendly Ground In a pivotal scene near the end of the novel, Jim visits Antonia who has just been deserted by Larry Donovan. As the childhood friends drift toward Mr. Shimerda's grave and sit in the softly moving red grass, they talk about Jim's life in Lincoln and Cambridge. After asking Jim about city life, Antonia quietly asserts that she would "always be miserable in a city." Instead, she says, "I like to be where I know every stack and tree, and where all the ground is friendly. I want to live and die here" (240). Such a notion of friendly ground signifies a particular relationship to one's environ- ment-one of safety, belonging, and welcoming- and is crucial to understanding the stakes of agricultural cultivation. In articulating a longing for friendly ground Antonia is voicing a sense of participa- tion in the dynamics of a natural world and is extending her child- hood insistence that sleeping in the small cave carved into the wall of her family's dugout can be a positive experience. At the same time, however, Antonia is also implicitly articulating her own ethic of cultivation, for the Cuzak farm on which she lives and thrives at the novel's end is friendly ground precisely because it is a highly planned and well-cultivated compound. By the novel's end, it seems clear that Antonia occupies something very much like the friendly ground she had so hungrily longed after in her youth and that she has worked hard to create the fruitful ground that is responsive to her needs. Even while she tells Jim, "I belong on a farm. I'm never lonesome here like I used to be in town," she also dis- avows the enormity of the effort it takes to cultivate the land to produce what she needs, saying, "I don't mind the work a bit" (255). She voices her desire to extend her own friendliness to her environ- ment, too, telling Jim that she does not like to kill animals for food, laughingly relating how the trees that comprise her apple orchard are always "on my mind like children," and noting that she regularly rises in the middle of the night to "carr[y] water to the poor things." Of course, one reason the orchard needs special watering is that it is not a natural growth but instead is meticulously planted and grafted for maximum productivity according to the expertise Anton Cuzak honed while cultivating orange groves in Florida. As Jim sits in the pleasant shade of the orchard, he notes that he is in a space of "the deepest peace." This peace is partially achieved through protective construction: the cultivated orchard is carefully protected within a</page><page sequence="12">54 ISLE "triple enclosure" designed to create a micro-climate protected from summer's hot winds and winter's freezing snows and in which the delicate fruit can grow vigorously and thrive (253). In fact, agricultural cultivation is a process specifically designed to make land more amenable to human desires and needs- it makes land more fruitful, more arable, more productive for humans. In other words, cultivated land is more conducive to human ease and is friendlier, all around, to human habitation. The question of what con- stitutes friendly ground, then, seems to lie at the center of the issue of cultivation for the question is both socially contingent and materially significant. Antonia's occupation of friendly ground at the novel's end is the result of her financial prosperity and her position as wife on one of the "rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses" (much to the chagrin of the "harassed Black Hawk merchant [s]" who, years earlier had assumed the social inferiority of Antonia and the other immigrant hired girls). In other words, the friendly ground that Antonia now occupies is the direct result of her physical mastery over the land and her consequent rise in status (155). As has become increasingly clear, what constitutes friendly ground for one individual can easily be unfriendly ground for others. As Jim and his grandmother render the prairie grasslands safe and friendly for themselves through the systematic extermination of snakes, they create hostile, lethal ground for the snakes themselves. In addition to the overt violence of wildlife control, however, the Burdens'- indeed, all the farmers'- presence alters the delicate balance of the existing ecosystem in ways that benefit certain species while harming others.6 Finally, the prosperity and abundance that come out of the United States's settlement of the North American grasslands during the nineteenth century is predicated on the eradi- cation of Native American populations from those same lands. By the time Jim inhabits the friendly ground of his grandparents' prosperous farm, indigenous populations have been relentlessly driven out and are present only in memory, as a circle "faintly marked in the grass" on the hillside outside the Burden door (52).7 As these examples make clear the relationship between people and their environment in the production of what Antonia calls friendly ground is not neutral, but like the ethic of cultivation relies on a dynamic of power and domination. That friendly ground for some arises specifically out of the proc- esses of power and domination is perhaps clearest in the mining imagery that Jim uses to triumphantly describe Ántonia's life. By the time Jim calls her "a rich mine of life, like the founders of early</page><page sequence="13">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 55 races/' it is clear that Antonia herself functions as friendly ground for Jim's own nostalgia (261). When Jim renders her as a mine- a hole dug into the earth from which valuable minerals are extracted for profit- he positions her as a source of value that is not particularly different from the mines and oil wells he finances in his work as a railroad man. Of course, Antonia herself, who "more than any other person" stands in his memory for "the country" of his childhood, is clearly another of his "big Western dreams" (4-5). Aligned with the prairie environment and Jim's money-making holes in the ground, it is clear that while Antonia masters the prairie and makes it friendly ground for her family, she herself is linguistically mastered by Jim in the manuscript he produces about her. Antonia is thus made into friendly ground for Jim's authorial predilections, as he shapes an account of her life's meaning to his own satisfaction. Fruit Caves At the novel's end, Antonia lives in a "wide farm-house, with a red barn and an ash grove" set back on a "swell of land" forming a pleasing view from the road (246). The roof is "so steep that the eaves [are] not much above the forest of hollyhocks" which are planted in pleasing profusion around the house's perimeter (252). In fact, the Cuzak farm seems to function according to the terms of Gaston Bachelard's "felicitous space"- that is, as a site that serves the func- tion of domestic space and which has "protective value" for its inhab- itants through its ability to concentrate vitality and security into a single spiritually charged site (xxxi).8 When Jim arrives after a twenty-year absence, Antonia and her children are excited to show him around their comfortable farm and there is no location of which they are more proud than their new "fruit cave." As a sheltering hole dug into the ground, the Cuzak fruit cave both recalls and revises the old Shimerda dugout. It too is labeled a "cave" but it is no miserable hole in the ground. Instead, it is a cozy and bountiful cave of plenti- tude, holding the ample preserves that are proof of the friendliness of the cultivated ground of the Cuzak farm. The fruit cave evokes some elements of the Burdens' subterranean kitchen, as well, for as the group descends down the steps into the earth, Ántonia's sons point out the "stout brick walls and the cement floor" that have transformed this dugout into a snug room (251). Like the Burden kitchen, the fruit cave is full of delectable treats and delicious food: Ántonia's children point out a barrel of dill pickles, one of chopped pickles, and another bursting with pickled waterme- lon rinds. They point to row upon row of colorful glass jars lining the</page><page sequence="14">56 ISLE walls, carefully tracing the outlines of "cherries and strawberries and crabapples" on their gleaming surfaces, and "trying by a blissful expression of countenance" to communicate the utter lusciousness of the jars' contents (251-2). It is in the abundance of delicious food lining the walls of the cave that it becomes clear that the transforma- tion of Shimerda "badger hole" into Cuzak "fruit cave" is not merely about the contrast between abundance and privation. It is quite liter- ally about Antonia's acquisition of cultivation in multiple senses: not only is the cave full of the preserved fruit that she has cultivated on her farm, its bounty also guarantees that she no longer needs to rely on the charity of more prosperous neighbors to ensure her family eats. The carefully pickled and preserved vegetables filling the barrels in her own fruit cave will not spoil, unlike the potatoes rotting in the bottom of the barrel her mother kept. In addition to learning agricul- tural cultivation, Antonia has also internalized the forms of social cul- tivation that have been communicated to her over the years. She confides to Jim that she has taken special care to teach her children the "nice ways" she herself learned at the Harling house. She proudly asks him, "Don't you think they're pretty well behaved for country children?" before laughingly asserting that, "if it hadn't been for what Mrs. Harling taught me, I expect I'd have brought them up like wild rabbits" (255). Neither Antonia's well-ordered frame home nor her fully stocked fruit cave bear much resemblance to the "badger hole" of her youth yet Jim continues to narrate the members of her household using terms that resonate with the animality through which he and his grandmother had judged the Shimerda house to be deficient many years earlier. Leo, for example, is figured as the direct descendent of old Mrs. Shimerda and Jim clearly depicts him as not-quite-human. Leo has "a ruddy pelt as thick as a lamb's wool, growing down his neck in little tufts" (247) and when Antonia forgets his age her son "butt[s] her playfully with his curly head, like a little ram" (249). Leo accompanies Jim and the older boys to the pasture to do the milking, all the while frolicking around them in the long grass and calling out, "I'm a jack rabbit" or "I'm a big bull-snake" (256). After all this play- acting, Jim finally concludes that Leo "really was faun-like. He had n't much head behind his ears and his tawny fleece grew down thick to the back of his neck" (258). When Jim settles down for the night in the haymow with Ambrosch and Leo, the two boys happily huddle together in a "hay-cave" they have carved out for themselves, volun- tarily spending the night in a small hollow reminiscent of the one in which Antonia and Yulka slept as children (260). Cuzak, Antonia's husband, is similarly described in ways that align him with</page><page sequence="15">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 57 domesticated and laboring animality, for Jim notes that he "always looked at people sidewise, as a work-horse does at its yoke-mate" (264). Cather's novel thus ends in a show of ambiguity over the status of human relationships to non-humans and to the environment. While Antonia's own children and household seem to resist and to compli- cate a simple binary between human and non-human that an ethic of cultivation demands, Jim's repeated rendering of the Cuzak family members as animal-like is a subtle reassertion of the condemnation he had, years earlier, heaped on the Shimerda family for the seeming animality of their habits. While Cather's novel has long been pointed to as a celebration of the natural world in which Antonia is posi- tioned as earth mother, the novel's proliferation of underground dwellings and their conflicting associations suggests a more complex perspective on the natural world and Antonia's status in it. The ethic of cultivation promulgated by the Burdens and imposed on their immigrant neighbors ruptures the seeming stability of the novel as any simple celebration, for it is clear that the Burdens have a troubled relationship to the environment. By extension, if a major premise of ecology is that the existing natural world warrants preservation as the best possible world then the ethical problem of cultivation and friendly ground raised in Cather's novel must persist in the most basic considerations of what it means for humans to interact with their environments. If cultivation constitutes the creation of friendly ground for one species at the expense of others, then humans face a very real ethical dilemma. While the Burdens' ethic of cultivation is clearly depicted as a troubling form of power and coercion, it also seems clear that the alternative- of living in an uncultivated world- is not a real possibility for humans do change the environments in which they live. In the end, Cather's novel does not make a strong statement for or against the Burdens' ethic of cultivation. It does, however, very clearly outline the stakes central to current ecological debate, particu- larly insofar as cultural and class biases are in conflict with environ- mental concerns. Today the ethic of cultivation continues to manifest itself across the United States in a number of forms, including legal restrictions on the construction of earth dwellings. While a resurgence of interest in sustainable, energy-efficient, semi-subterranean homes has emerged in recent decades, individuals who wish to build and dwell in such homes face a number of obstacles that are the result of continued ecophobia of the sort Cather describes. In many munici- palities, the ethic of cultivation is embedded in building codes and zoning ordinances that are written with wood frame construction in</page><page sequence="16">58 ISLE mind, and which consequently impede the expansion of earth shel- tered construction. Mortgage lenders, too, are often reluctant to finance earth-sheltered projects because of the perception that under- ground homes will be undesirable to most subsequent buyers.9 What My Antonias ethic of cultivation exposes, then, is that powerful obstacles to bioregionally appropriate housing- and to ecologically sound principles more generally- can stem from classed cultural norms that associate repugnance with the earth itself. Recognition of this particular dynamic will be increasingly central to the work of environmental activists, and must also form a constitutive element of an environmentally conscious literary criticism. Notes 1. Such an understanding of dwelling, Garrard continues, "inflects nature as the troubled ground of work, knowledge, economy and responsibility" rather than as an unproblematic backdrop for human life (134). Cather's novels more generally depict a number of instances of what Garrard calls "dwelling" as well as its attendant figure, the "ecological Indian." As Patrick Dooley has carefully documented, Death Comes for the Archbishop's Father Latour reflects that "just as it was the white man's way to assert himself in any landscape, to change it, to make it over a little ... it was the Indian's way to pass through a country without disturbing anything." Similarly, the immi- grant Ivar in O Pioneers ! has "lived for three years in the clay bank, without defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that had lived there before he had done" (both quoted in Dooley 70). 2. This reading of My Antonia complicates Mary Ryder's recent claim that through the use of male narrators like Jim Burden Cather "espoused an envi- ronmental ethic that would not reconstruct nature but would reconstruct human relationships with the natural world" (84). Instead, I argue that the Burdens' commitment to an ethic of cultivation reinforces a rigid human/non- human divide that can be- and often is- used to critique and police human behavior into conforming to social codes of classed refinement and cultivation. 3. Steven Trout has pointed out that "the encounter with the snake is much more ambiguous" than it us usually read, because while the scene is widely understood as an act of self defense, the prose actually suggests that Jim instigates the encounter and acts as aggressor (103). 4. In fact, the ethic of cultivation draws heavily on what has long been recognized in American fiction studies as the idealization of a pastoral middle state. Something like Leo Marx's concept of the "middle landscape" which exhibits a "happy balance between art and nature" (226), is clearly at play in Cather's ethic of cultivation as the Burdens repudiate the Shimerda land that remains too "wild." More recently, William Barillas has character- ized Cather's work as a "prototype[] of the midwestern pastoral" that com- bines Virgilian plots, romantic nature mysticism, and Jeffersonian esteem for</page><page sequence="17">Subterranean Living and the Ethic of Cultivation 59 small landowners in fictional accounts of "imaginative, industrious people who relate spiritually as well as practically to their adopted landscape" (56). 5. Rosowski articulates the connection between earth and birth in her 1987 "Willa Cather and the Fatality of Place: O Pioneers /, My Antonia , and A Lost Lady" Rosowski reads the entire Shimerda dugout as a positive symbol of birth, noting that "we meet the young Antonia as she emerges from a hole in the bank of the prairie, and . . . the effect is almost as if the earth itself has given birth to her." It is this series of associations that leads Rosowski to con- clude that Antonia is "a child of nature who has followed her destiny to be an earth mother" by the novel's end (88). Rosowski extends this formula in her Birthing a Nation , in which she asserts that Cather's account of Antonia's sleeping hole is likely influenced by the "Acoma Pueblo origin myth" which sat on the bookshelves of the Cather home, and in which "she would have read of two sisters who were born underground and remained in the dark as they slowly and patiently grew until they finally emerged through a hole made by a badger" (81). Alternatively, Ann Fisher-Wirth has pointed to the scene in which Antonia actually gives birth to her own first daughter as another moment in which Cather links Antonia, birth, and animality in ways that are positive. Pointing out that Cather situates "illegitimate motherhood among natural processes" and also renders the birth itself in terms that reso- nate with animal births, Fisher-Wirth notes that Antonia quite simply and calmly shuts herself in a room and "bears her child literally dumb" with "none of the help or companionship that generally accompanies human birth" (190-1). 6. Steven Trout has pointed to the presence of this dynamic in what he calls Mrs. Burden's program of "assertive wildlife management" (106). 7. Mike Fischer, in particular, has noted how strange it is that this faint circle seems to be the only trace of displaced Indian populations in the novel. Fischer notes that in Nebraska, "Red Cloud became a reminder, for those who chose to remember, that its prosperity and security were predicated upon the removal and elimination of the people for whose chief it was named- people who still occupied most of Nebraska as late as the American Civil War" (34). Cather's fictionalization of Red Cloud into Black Hawk retains a similar reference, referring to Chief Black Hawk who fought against white efforts to gain control of the prairie in the early 1830s. This history, however, apparently does not form a part of Jim's consciousness. 8. I have Judith Fryer's Felicitous Space: The Imaginative Structures of Edith Wharton and Willa Cather to thank for this connection with Bachelard's work, although Fryer's focus is on Cather's southwestern novels rather than My Antonia. 9. A quick internet search for "earth sheltered homes" turns up half a dozen companies specializing in this kind of construction, as well a numer- ous do-it-yourself books and online communities devoted to discussion of the motivations and challenges shared by those building and living in earth sheltered homes. The foundational publication outlining the legal obstacles to earth-sheltered housing is "Earth Sheltered Housing: Code, Zoning, and Financing Issues" published in 1980. While many of the document's</page><page sequence="18">60 ISLE recommendations for altering and updating zoning and code requirements to allow earth dwellings have been adopted by individual communities over the past three decades, there is by no means a uniform or widespread adop- tion of the document's recommendations. In many places, the construction of earth sheltered housing remains a daunting legal and financial hurdle. Works Cited Bachelard, Gaston. The Poetics of Space. Trans. Maria Jolas.
