<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS Golan, Chalcolithic Sites, 1984* Dab'es (Dvash) Reservoir Site, map ref. 2229 2581 (Fig. 1:15). During the winter of 1983-1984, the water level in the Dab'es reservoir reached some 6 m., completely covering the Chalcolithic site in its southern sector which had been known since 1976. In the summer of 1984, when the reservoir had almost completely emptied, a small salvage excavation was carried out by Claire Epstein, on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums, with a view to clarifying as many details as possible concerning the site. The lines of house walls, built of unworked basalt, could be traced only with difficulty, since all that remained of them were the lowest courses laid on the natural rock surface. Here and there patches of paved floors were still extant, on which was a scatter of typical Chalcolithic sherds. Limited probes were made in four rectangular house complexes measuring about 16.5 X 6.5 m., built as elsewhere on an east-west axis. Two of the houses were aligned end-to-end with a common cross wall between, though their corners were not identical. Some 8 m. to the south was another building, parallel to them, while a fourth lay about 9 m. to its south. There is thus every likelihood that the general layout of the site conformed to a plan consisting of a series of parallel chains of houses, similar to that found elsewhere. The Dab'es site is situated in a region of close Chalcolithic settlement: within a radius of no more than 1-2 km. round it lie seven sites, of which three (Fig. 1:14, 16, 19) were identified in 1983 and early 1984. During this period, areas up to 10 km. north of the reservoir were also surveyed. At two previously discovered sites, additional houses were located (Fig. 1:4, 9), while a new site was identified near the Ja'adan stream (Fig. 1:8, below). Site north-west of Qalaq, map ref. 2215 2589 (Fig. 1:14). This unnamed site lies 1 km. north west of the abandoned village of Qalaq (close to the Dab'es reservoir) and 0.5 km. south of Rasm Harbush (Fig. 1:12). Situated on rising ground on the northern bank of a seasonal stream, the settlement contains at least ten houses of the broad-house type, oriented generally east-west. Further west the seasonal stream joins the Tannurieh, which is a perennial stream and was the main source of water for the settlement, as it was for Rasm Harbush to the north. The choice of a location close to a seasonal stream, while the perennial stream is at some distance, is a recurrent phenomenon. A position of this kind was no doubt chosen on account of the easily accessible water-retentive soil on both sides of shallow seasonal water courses. Owing to the nature of the local basalt terrain, such riparian soil remains saturated for a considerable length of time and was valued for growing field crops, / 1 j Jgolan "25? p^YIFTAWEL \ i f fpiTtfAT /TEL DOR HA-YARMUK /TEL* ? # JERUSALEM / M IONE TEL / / / YARMUT ( I "y J ' eNEWE NOY ?(^ "SHIQMIM \-J -050 0 20 40 -000 , t-n -?km. ?-1-?-1-1_ * Cf.

Saturated soil is likewise found in the area immediately north of the site, as is demonstrated by its cover of plants indigenous to damp places. The wadi through which the seasonal stream flows fans out in the west, providing excellent grazing over a wide area. In the summer of 1984, limited probes were made across the whole width of either the eastern or western end of five house complexes, in which typical ceramic and lithic material was found; in the western end of one of the houses was a particularly large assemblage of characteristic artifacts. Adjoining this building on the west was another, with a transverse party wall between them and non-identical corners (see above), the two clearly forming part of a house chain. A small area across the eastern end of the second house was cleared; it was divided into two small rooms (or store-rooms) ? a feature more usual in the western end. Some 13 m. to the north, a small section of the western end of another house was examined, which probably formed part of the northernmost house chain. Here the overall space is divided by an internal long wall, which is built closer to the northern than to the southern wall of the house and may well continue for most of the length of the building. This is an accepted method</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 55 of dividing up the overall inner space, occurring at a number of sites. As a result of the very limited trial excavation carried out at the site, the settlement is seen to be characteristic of Chalcolithic culture in the Golan, not only in regard to artifacts, but also insofar as siting, layout and architectural features are concerned. Site near the Ja'adan stream, map ref. 2215 2652 (Fig. 1:8). In the late summer of 1983, a hitherto unknown Chalcolithic site was identified less than 1 km. west of the Ja'adan, which is a perennial stream. The unnamed site lies on both sides of a seasonal stream, though the main concentration of houses was probably on a small hill situated between the two water courses. Prior to its recognition the site had been much disturbed as the result of defence works, especially on the hill, and displaced stones had been piled up haphazardly round its periphery. As a result, many of the ancient walls were destroyed and Chalcolithic sherds were scattered over a wide area. Among the piled-up stones round the edge of the hillock was a circular basalt stand without facial features which terminates above in a circular bowl (height 0.3 m.). It belongs to a wide range of cultic objects of this kind which are unique to the Golan Chalcolithic culture. The slopes below the hill descend on the north to the seasonal stream bed, on either side of which there is a considerable cover of plants that grow in damp soil. Directly north of the seasonal stream, two or possibly three rectangular buildings were identified, built of unusually large boulders and situated close to one another. Especially impressive was the westernmost house (No. 2); its southern wall could be traced for some 9 m., standing two-three courses above ground-level. The line of the northern wall, distinguishable on the surface, was cleared along most of its length. In the summer of 1984 a trial excavation was made at the site with a view to obtaining additional information regarding the house plans, settlement layout and artifacts. On the summit of the hill, the southern wall of a house (No. 3) was traced for some 16 m. from east to west. A small probe (3.5 m.) was made across the eastern end of the building and both faces of the cross wall were cleared (outer length 5.8 m.). Although only a small area was excavated, the overall dimensions of House 3 are probably very similar to those of other houses of the period in the Golan. The eastern end of the house is divided into two by an inner wall built parallel to and closer to the southern wall; but it was not possible to determine whether it continued along the whole length of the building to form a narrow room on the south, rather than on the north (see above). A typical assemblage of pottery, basalt and flint artifacts was found in House 3. Most of the work was carried out in House 2, on the northern bank of the seasonal stream. It proved to be the largest building found to date at any Chalcolithic site in the Golan (23.5 X 7 m.). Trial probes were made across its eastern end and the centre (3 and 1.5 sq.m. respectively), while at the western end a much larger area (7 sq.m.) was uncovered. In the east, the house is divided into two similarly-sized rooms, but owing to the limitations of the work their exact nature could not be determined. Here bedrock was reached at no great depth and only a few sherds and basalt vessel fragments were found. In the central sector of the house, which from the outset appeared to be relatively free from fallen stones, a shallow probe was made across the whole width of the building, including the entrance (width 1.3 m.) in the southern wall, as is usual. Floor-level was not reached and few artifacts came to light Significant results were obtained when the western end of the house was cleared. Solidly built walls (1 m. wide) form the western end of the house, which is divided into two unequal store rooms. Entrance is through a doorway in the eastern wall of the south-western room (3x3 m.), while access to the north-western store-room (2.5 X 1.9 m.) is through an opening in its southern wall, directly from the adjoining one. Immediately east of the northern store-room is a well-built, stone-lined silo (PI. 9:4; diameter of opening 1.2 m.; maximum depth 1.5 m.). Set into the floor, it is enclosed on three sides: on the north by the northern wall of the house, on the west by the eastern wall of the store-room and on the south by a short support wall built specially for this purpose. Immediately east of the silo, a secton of the paved floor of the house was uncovered about 0.7 m. below the surface, on which was found a typical flint adze (length</page><page sequence="4">56 NOTES AND NEWS 0.13 m.). At the foot of the wall south of the silo lay the rim and upper shoulder of a pithos decorated with rope pattern in an uncommon design. Careful examination of the contents of the silo failed to reveal any organic material. The discovery of a silo in a building close to the fields emphasizes its connection with crop cultivation and storage. The pithos, likewise a storage vessel, probably served the day-to-day requirements of the household. In the vicinity of the site near the Ja'adan stream are several dolmens, one close to and slightly north of House 2 (2.3 X 0.9 m.; axis north to south; entry from south). Built on high ground and surrounded by a much-denuded tumulus, it was partly covered by a heavy roof stone in position over the closed end and mid chamber; the second roof stone was no longer extant. When cleared, there were signs of disturbance indicating entry, possibly on several occasions, in the past. Below a fill of light coloured, powdery earth, fallen stones and a selection of late sherds, the chamber was paved with large stone slabs and contained no original finds. In marked contrast to the conspicuous position of this dolmen, a second dolmen unexpectedly came to light in the south western corner of House 2. Prior to clearance of the house it had been indistinguishable from the piles of stones which had accumulated from the Chalcolithic building in whose ruins it had been erected. Because of its well-concealed position it has remained undisturbed. The builders of the dolmen (2.35 X 0.8 m.; axis south to north; entry from the south) had utilized a section of the house's western wall which was incorporated in the chamber; against its inner face a transverse block was set up at right angles to form the closed end, while two similar blocks, set side by side parallel to the western wall, formed the adjacent lateral wall. The dolmen was paved and was covered by two heavy roof stones. Near the closed end was a scatter of bones and a well-preserved MB I copper dagger (0.175 m.) with three rivets in position. There was no indication of a tumulus round the dolmen. The finding of a dolmen built above floor-level inside a Chalcolithic house emphasizes their relative stratigraphy. The discovery of an intact original deposit in the dolmen chamber consisting of a secondary burial and a typical weapon provides additional evidence for dating the Golan dolmens to the MB I. (Communicated by Claire Epstein) Pithat ha-Yarmuk For four days at the end of December 1983, a small trial excavation was made at a site on the north bank of the Yarmuk river (map ref. 2015 2321 - 2016 2322) by Claire Epstein and E. Eisenberg on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums, assisted by M. Lufan of Kibbutz Ginosar and a group of teenagers from the kibbutz. I. Vatkin carried out the surveying. The site, first discovered in the course of the Special Survey of the Golan in 1967-1968 (Site No. 209) when it was identified as Chalcolithic, extends to both sides of the Zemah-Hammat Gader road. Subsequently, large-scale distur bance was caused by deep cuttings and earth dumping. In the summer of 1983, a limited probe was made in the southern sector where a living surface was reached. On the strength of this, a light tractor was brought in for the controlled removal of earth over an area of some four dunams (one acre) to a level slightly above the occupation layer. The trial excavation at the end of 1983 revealed a rectangular building measuring 4 X 6 m. (Fig. 1; PI. 9:B). Overlying its north-eastern corner, a circular wall aligned along a different axis came to light, with a second circular wall built onto it on the north. A little to the north west was a small silo. Several variously oriented wall sections were found, especially south of the rectangular building. Beyond the confines of the investigated area, M. Lufan discovered a stone-lined tomb built into the slope above the river, which had been partly destroyed (possibly at the time of the construction of the nearby railway line now disused). In it were found three intact vessels: a pottery bowl and shoulder-handled jar, and a high-footed basalt bowl, all of which can be assigned to the EB. Human skeletal remains were also present in the tomb and scattered bone material lay on the slope below. A flint dagger of a much earlier date was also found in the tomb.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS 57 Fig. 1. Pithat ha-Yarmuk, plan of excavated remains. A second restricted probe lasting four days was made in May 1984, directed by Claire Epstein, assisted by M. Lufan and the same group of youngsters. Additional wall sections were exposed belonging to different building phases. North of the rectangular building, at a level below the circular wall and the silo, a well built wall came to light which is clearly earlier than either. Further west, two walls at right angles form the corner of another building, likewise below the level of the silo. South and west of the rectangular building additional wall sections belonging to different phases were uncovered, indicating structures not yet exposed. In both the above probes no noticeable differences were discerned in the character of the ceramic or lithic material, which may be assigned to the early EB I. The pottery (coated with a thick layer of incrustation) includes a large number of non-restorable sherds, frequently covered with red wash or with irregular lines of red paint, sometimes with a geometrical pattern. The larger vessels are often decorated also with one or two bands of impressed rope pattern. The vessel forms include bowls with linear incisions on the rim, small thin-ware bowls covered inside and out with red slip and storage-jars with everted rims. There are plain tongue-like ledge handles as well as wide vertical handles, flat bases and occasional disc bases. Part of a Grey Burnished ware bowl of early type was also found. The lithic assemblage includes basalt and limestone vessels, among them a biconical limestone stand; in and near the rectangular building were a number of adzes made of flint and limestone, their shape recalling but differing from the Chalcolithic tools of this type. Among the vessels were a small bowl or lamp with red-painted rim, the upper part of a storage-jar and the lower half of another. These two trial excavations have raised a number of problems, the solution to which can only be arrived at through large-scale excavation. The Yarmuk site is likely to yield important information regarding the EB I, revealed here for the first time in the Golan together with architectural remains. Moreover, the possibility should not be ruled out that earlier strata lie below the EB I deposits, including some from the Chalcolithic period so strongly attested by intensive village settlement in the basalt regions of the central Golan. (Communicated by Claire Epstein)</page><page sequence="6">58 NOTES AND NEWS Yiftah'el, 1984* As a result of the Department of Antiquities and Museums' salvage excavations at Yiftah'el in Lower Galilee (map ref. 1719 2401), it was decided by the Department that the area under excavation was too valuable to permit its destruction by a new road. The authorities were persuaded to divert the course of the road away from the excavated portions of the site, thus saving them for future exploration. A second short season, again sponsored and funded by the Department of Antiquities and Museums, was devoted to the solving of specific problems and to the obtaining of details through small, highly controlled probes and soundings. This in essence was a completion of the first season's work. The excavating team included E. Braun, S. Gibson and T. Matney, with the participation of volunteers from North America and Western Europe. The expedition was lodged at Kibbutz ha-Solelim, in the fields of which the site is located. As in the previous season, the excavation of Area C was supervised by Y. Garfinkel as a separate unit (see below, pp. 59-60). Area A Stratum II: excavation here was limited to several probes and the clearing of an adjacent area previously disturbed by bulldozing, in which partial walls and quantities of potsherds were already visible in the first season. A series of parallel walls was uncovered, indicating the existence of a number of building phases within a tightly compressed stratigraphie sequence. On the partially exposed earthen floor of one building a large quantity of pottery and burnt mud brick was found, clearly indicating the EBI date of the latest of these structures. Unfortunately the bulldozing activities and the cover of muddy alluvium rich in clay which dries to a rock-hard state combined to prevent the salvage of little more than samples of the pottery. In a deeper exploration below the floor of an EB I house (Locus 13) were found remnants of a series of earlier structures, some of them dated by the pottery finds to the same cultural horizon. Stratum III: probes in, around and below the 'megaron' type building of Stratum III produced large quantities of flint but no pottery, suggesting that this building may belong to a phase of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. A proposed detailed study of the lithics should help define this material culture. Adjacent to the 'megaron' was found a secondary burial consisting of two skulls, a pelvis and several long bones, probably placed in a hollow or shallow pit dug into the living surface. The only apparent offering found associated with the bones was a broken blade tool of finely pressure-flaked flint. Another rectangular building of this stratum, also apparently with porticoes (perhaps another 'megaron'), was uncovered beneath a small elliptical house of the EB I. Here again no sherds were in evidence in this level, but several limestone bowls found within the structure, as well as its architectural features, clearly link it with Stratum III. Stratum IV and below: in a limited probe into a Stratum IV enclosure, a curious oval installation, about 1 m. long and 0.4 m. high, composed of stones and fragments of burnt mud brick was found built into the earthen floor. It parallels a similar structure uncovered in the first season directly outside this enclosure. In a deep probe below the level of the floor of the 'megaron' and just outside its western wall was found an accumulation of more than one metre of artifact bearing muddy alluvium mixed with small quantities of burnt organic material. No traces of structures were found, but the flint included tools and debitage typical of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. These occupational deposits were found in the lowest level of the probe, which was discontinued owing to lack of time before virgin soil could be reached. Area Stratum II: activity in this area was confined to the area within the walls of the largest EB I house, where remains of four building phases of this horizon were uncovered in the previous season. Excavation uncovered a layer of up to 50 cm. of fill covering a succession of earthen floors on which a number of well-preserved pottery vessels of the EB I were found. The lowest of these floors, strewn with sherds, underlay the lowermost wall, indicating a fifth and earlier occupation dating from this period. *Cf./?7 34(1984),pp. 191-194.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS 59 Because of the compressed nature of the stratigraphy (the walls here are built virtually one over another) and the slope of the site, vessels cannot reliably be attributed to individual structures. Summary The pottery from Area is in a better state of preservation that that of Area A because of the soil matrix in which it lies. The soil in Area is greyer in colour, contains less clay, retains less moisture, dries more quickly and does not harden into rock-like clumps. Thus the fill in Area is more easily excavated and it can be screened. All fill in Area was carefully sifted with a resulting increase in recovery of sherds and flint. Below this layer of soil lies another, even greyer and more powdery, containing enormous quantities of flint, similar to and probably the same matrix in which the remains of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement excavated in Area C were found. The bifurcation in the geological features of the site appears to be reflected in the archaeological record prior to the EBI occupation. There is no clear evidence for the existence in Area of a building stratum exactly equivalent to either Stratum III or Stratum IV of Area A. It seems likely, on the basis of relative stratigraphy, that Strata III and IV of Area A and the Pre Pottery Neolithic Strata of Area C may be rqughly contemporary and perhaps belong to the same cultural horizon, although the inherent difficulties in such a hypothesis are numerous. The obvious differences in architecture and ground stone industries and what seem to be differences in the flaked stone industries cannot be easily reconciled. Restoration by Michal Ben-Gal of the poorly preserved pottery contents of a large EB I house of Area A has yielded a number of vessels which form the beginnings of a large and important corpus of domestic ware. A study of the plans of the EB I settlement by T. Mazzola, architect, has suggested the possibility that the rounded structures were not free-standing but may have been built in clusters or aggregations for purposes of stability. It is hoped that future excavation will enable the testing of this hypothesis. (Communicated by Eliot Braun) Yiftah'el, Pre-Pottery Neolithic Layers, 1983-1984 As part of the salvage project at Yiftah'el carried out by the Department of Antiquities and Museums, two seasons of excavation in the PPNB layers were directed by Y. Garfinkel. The field work was carried out in close cooperation with E. Braun. Some 185 sq.m. were excavated in an area named Area C, located some 50 m. south of the salvage excavation directed by M. Lamdan andM. Davies in 1982(/?/33 [1983], p. 259). Two metres of occupational debris of the PPNB period, divided into five stratigraphie units, can be recognized in the excavated area. This division is based on Structure 700, which is stratigraphie unit No. 2; the other units are related to this one. Unit No. 1 consists of the accumulation above unit No. 2, and is a light grey sediment approximately 30 cm. thick, rich in finds: concentrations of flint, including large plates of flint from which cores were produced, animal bones, sea shells and burials descending into the red brick debris of unit No. 2. In unit No. 2 (Structure 700), the main features are rectangular architecture and plaster floors, various installations and concentrations of seeds and hearths (see below). Unit No. 3 is a light grey sediment, 30 cm. thick, similar to unit No. 1. Unit No. 4 is a layer of dark brown clay sediment about 35 cm. thick, which was reached in two trial pits of four and five sq.m. respectively. This layer is characterized by well-preserved botanical material (charcoal and seeds) and scanty flint. This might imply a settlement gap. Unit No. 5 is a layer of red brick material 75 cm. thick, containing scanty, non-indicative flint and identified only in a trench measuring 2 X 0.5 m. Unit No. 6 is a sterile dark brown clay sediment, similar to unit No. 4, possibly virgin soil. Structure 700. The excavations in 1983 focused on this rectangular dwelling (Fig. 1: PI. 9:C). The structure (17 X 7.5 m.) consists of three architectural units, two open courtyards with plastered floors flanking one central room. The character of each unit enables a partial reconstruction of the fnctions carried out in each of them and an understanding of the activity areas on the living floor. The room (4 X 7.5 m.) was constructed of mud</page><page sequence="8">60 NOTES AND NEWS j L72? v v'^: :' Fig. 1. Yiftah'el, plan of Structure 700. Hatched areas are walls found in the excavation; dotted areas are the plaster floor. brick and had probably been roofed over. On its floor a large quantity of two species of pulses were found, one in a built silo, the other in a concentration on the floor. All the sediment was collected and the net weight of the seeds alone is some seven kg. The silo, the enormous quantity of seeds and its separation from the courtyards indicate that this room served as a store-room. The northern courtyard (4 X 7.5 m.) is characterized by various installations and three stone anvils, probably implying that this area was a workshop. The southern courtyard (7X7 m.) is in a poor state of preservation; only its eastern part was preserved. In its north-eastern corner two grinding stones were found. A grinding spot may be identified here. An open space to the north of this structure contained stone hearths in which were found many animal bones, indicating that this was a cooking area. The building techniques used appear to be of high standard. The extensive use of plaster and the many pieces of limekiln slags which were found in the excavation area point to the manufacture of burnt lime products at the site. Structure 730. Excavations in 1984 focused on a second rectangular plastered dwelling, Structure 730. This structure has not been completely uncovered and its state of preservation is less good than that of Structure 700. However, it seems that Structure 730 consists of two units, one long and narrow, the other wider. This plan is similar to that of a structure at Beisamun in the Huleh Valley. In the wider unit two plaster basins were found, one built on the floor and the second sunk into the floor. Two circular pits filled with thousands of small stones badly damaged the northern part of the structure. A third structure that began to appear towards the end of the excavation may supply the reason for the damage in the eastern part of Structure 730. (Communicated by Yosef Garfinkel) Tel Dor, 1984* The fifth season of excavation at Tel Dor, carried out in July-August, was directed by E.

The expedition staff also included: I. Sharon (assistant to the director), J. Berg (architect), B. Guz-Zilberstein (registrar), A. Cohen, M. Fleitman, A. Gilboa, D. Kaufman and S. Yankelevitch (field and area supervisors), L. Banks, J. Bradley, B. Frank, A. Kopczick, L. Lanigan, J. Linde, J. Northrop, D. Weiss and S. Williams (assistant area supervisors), R. Younkers (archaeo-zoologist), D. Eliyahu (pottery restorer) and S. Dahan (administrator). Some 250 students and volunteers participated in this season, which was also the study excavation of the Institute. The expedition was assisted by Kibbutz Nahsholim and its members, especially K. Raveh, and by the staff of the Pardess-Hannah Agricultural School and its director M. Gur. This year we continued to enlarge and deepen the three areas (A-C) opened in 1980 on the eastern edge of the mound, and added a fourth area (D) above the southern bay. Area C2. In the southernmost area, C, work was carried out only in its western part (C2). We dug into the Persian strata, of which several phases were found. The excavation area was inside a long, narrow building complex west of a street which divided two residential insulae. It was determined that the detailed planning of the residential quarter was started early in the Persian period, perhaps as early as the sixth century B.C.E., and continued to the Early Roman period. During this long occupation the plan was preserved and only the inner partition walls were changed. It was also confirmed that the quality of the Persian period builders' craftsmanship, in the classical Phoenician style, was higher than in the Hellenistic period. Area A (below) presents a similar picture. Several floor levels were lemoved and excavation was stopped when layers of the Iron Age were reached in the deepest probes. The preservation of the Persian period structures here is excellent; at some points the height of the walls (rebuilt several times during the Persian and Hellenistic periods) reaches 3 m. Area C, with its unique remains of Hellenistic (in the east) and Persian (in the west) structures, will be preserved, and excavation of lower strata will be carried out in other areas. Many local and imported pottery vessels were found in this area; especially remarkable is the assemblage of East Greek wares found in the lower phases. Area A. In this area, located south of Area C and constituting part of the same residential quarter (Fig. 1), we continued to excavate into the Persian period strata, as in Area C2, while comparing the stratigraphy of the two. Here also we stopped work after reaching the uppermost Iron Age level. The situation here is similar to that of Area C; part of a residential structure, including the eastern fa?ade of the easternmost insula and several rooms adjoining it were uncovered. Here too the position of the fa?ade was unchanged in all Persian and Hellenistic phases, while the interior plan of the house was changed several times. The fine quality of construction in the earlier periods was observed. In this area were uncovered local, East Greek and Attic pottery. Some remarkable finds are clay figurines, a conical glass stamp decorated with a Phoenician-style sphinx (PI. 10:C) and a complete askos, found in a pit sunk into Iron Age deposits. Area Cl. This season Area A was connected with Area C along the eastern edge of the mound. This new area, designated Cl, is devoted to the examination of the fortification systems, which are well preserved here. So far, six fortification lines have been uncovered (PI. 10:B). The uppermost is that built by Ptolemy II, sections of which, including square projecting towers, were found in all areas (Fig. 1), at some points preserved nearly to the surface. Under this wall and in front of it, a wall constructed in the Phoenician ashlar pier style was exposed. This wall is somewhat thicker than is usual in residential houses (nearly 1 m.), and constituted the outer limit of the town. Adjoining it are several long, narrow rooms which served as casemates and reached the line of the easternmost street. Several of the ashlar blocks here are dressed with the typical Israelite-Phoenician irregular marginal drafting; such masonry is found at Tyre, Dan, Hazor, Megiddo and Samaria, but here it is of a much later period. The latter structures are built on top of a very wide</page><page sequence="10">62 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. Tel Dor, Hellenistic fortifications and residential quarter, Areas A and C. (2.5-3 m.) solid wall, part of which had already been exposed in Area A under the Hellenistic tower in 1980; it is also known from Area (see below). It was built of large field stones in the offset-inset style. We believe that the chronology of the three uppermost fortification systems (from the bottom upwards) is as follows. The lowest offset-inset wall may have been built as early as the Assyrian period, and was destroyed late in the Persian period, perhaps in one of the Phoenician revolts of the first half of the fourth century. The 'casemate' wall above it was built immediately thereafter, and was used until the early Hellenistic period. Since it was not a very effective fortification, this wall was replaced by the massive ashlar city-wall in the days of Ptolemy II. This uppermost wall was used at least until the Early Roman period. Three additional fortification lines were found under those described above, all built of mud brick. Their exact dimensions and absolute chronology have not yet been determined, though the width of the uppermost system (which probably includes a wall and glacis) was found to be more than 7 m. In our opinion all three systems are from the Iron Age, but so far the evidence is insufficient for precise dating. Area Bl. Field is divided into two areas. In the northern one ( 1) we concentrated this season on two problems. In the east, we examined the fortifications. Here we found the sequence</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND NEWS 63 described above: the uppermost Hellenistic wall was removed to expose the 'casemate wall' and the full width of the stone socle of the offset-inset wall. Its width here is over 3 m., some 0.5 m. wider than the Hellenistic wall. Under these the mud-brick Iron Age wall was discovered. Here, as in Area C1, a mud-brick glacis attached to the outer face of the wall protects its foundations. As we already know from previous seasons of the existence of several strata of the Iron Age II?III inside the town, it is hoped that several stages will be found in the fortifications to match these. In the western part of Area Bl, we dug deeper into strata of the Early Iron Age. Last season we removed the uppermost Iron Age phase (probably seventh-sixth centuries B.C.E.), of which only some pits and installations were preserved. Some of these pits, dug deep into older deposits, were not cleared until this season. In one of these were found typical pottery and an inscribed shekel weight. A lower stratum (also largely removed last year) with two sub-phases may date from the ninth-eighth centuries; to it belong the four-chamber gate (see below) and the mud-brick wall. Inside the town some degree of planning may be discerned. In the east is a row of rooms, which may have been attached to the city wall. Opposite a narrow alley, running north-south, is an additional residential unit. The second main effort in Area Bl this year was in exposing the town of the eleventh and tenth centuries. It seems that the general layout in this phase is similar to that of the ninth-eighth centuries. The houses of both strata are generally built with stone foundations and mud-brick superstructure. Towards the end of the season, it was determined that in the centre of the excavated area, some 5-6 m. inside the later fortification lines, is a deep fill (at this stage deeper than 1 m.) of sand and brick material, containing MB potsherds (and the tooth of a hippopotamus). We may have reached here the top of an MB rampart, but this can only be proved by further excavation. In the strata of the eleventh-tenth centuries were found several fragments of painted Cypriote pottery, of types very rare in this country. We believe that they may be of the Proto White Painted I and early Bichrome I wares (PI. 10:D); this, however, will be verified by experts. Area B2. In this area we opened eight new units against the western and southern edge of the previously excavated area in order to reach the part of the town which lies inside the Israelite gate and to expose the southern half of the Iron Age four-chamber gate and the two-chamber gate above it, which were partly exposed in previous seasons. The picture here is complicated by the presence of monumental structures of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Of the Late Roman period we found the continuation of a system of installations, including several plastered pools. To one of these a reused sarcophagus was attached as a basin. It is possible that a large cement structure, believed last season to be medieval, is part of an aqueduct of this time. To the Early Roman period belong two massive piers made of ashlars and cement, with a paved passage in between. This may be the point at which the Roman aqueduct from the Carmel range enters the city; alternatively it may be part of a gate structure later than that found nearby, on top of the Hellenistic gate. In the western part of the area we found the continuation of the paved Roman gate court, on which the base of a statue or a monument was exposed. The well excavated in previous seasons is in the centre of this courtyard. West of the courtyard more parts of the monumental cement and ashlar building which formed its facade was exposed. Of the upper Hellenistic phase, to which the city-wall belongs, we uncovered the continuation of the structures near the city-gate, which partly lie under the monumental building mentioned above. A relatively narrow street leads from the gate into the town, where it intersects the first north-south street. Beyond this it leads further west, flanked, no doubt, by shops and workshops. Some of the construction of this phase is, as in other parts of the site, in the Phoenician ashlar pier and rubble fill style. The same plan is found in the intermediate Persian/Hellenistic phase (fourth century B.C.E.) which is associated with the 'casemate' wall. The gate passage and courtyard of the Persian period two-chamber gate had been uncovered in previous seasons. This year we exposed a long segment of the western wall of the southern gate tower and a small part of its eastern wall. Parts of a house built against this gate tower on the inside,</page><page sequence="12">64 NOTES AND NEWS and the first north-south street beyond it, were also exposed. The four-chamber Iron Age gate was reached only towards the end of the season, and only a few additional sections were found. Among these are parts of its southern wall and some stones of the central pilaster on its southern half. As mentioned above, the excavation here was hampered by massive later remains. Area D. This year we opened two small areas (Dl and D2) on the southern edge of the site, above the southern bay, which was probably the main harbour of the town. The two areas are located on both sides of the section cut by Garstang in the twenties. Area Dl is the westernmost of the two and is located near the Crusader fosse. In the upper portion we discovered mainly structures of the Roman and Hellenistic periods. Of the Roman period only a system of drainage channels was preserved. The Hellenistic remains consist of an east-west street from which runs a north-south street; between these streets are well-built houses. Of the Persian period strata we have uncovered only parts of walls which do not as yet form a coherent plan. Area D2 is located east of the former and closer to the bay. In the two upper (northernmost) units, we found again remains of the Roman, Hellenistic and Persian periods. In the later phases the picture is similar to that of D1 ? a well-built drainage channel which passed under the continuation of the east-west street. South of the street was uncovered part of a spacious Roman residence, the floor of one of its rooms decorated with a geometric polychrome mosaic. The preservation of the Hellenistic stratum here was poor. In the Persian period the area was apparently used for storerooms rather than residences. These structures, in which many storage-jar fragments were found, may be connected with harbour activities. Only the northern part of these structures remains, as the entire southern section has collapsed into the sea. In the two lower squares we uncovered the edge of a monumental building with a thick wall built of limestone boulders. According to a probe excavated on the seaward side of the same structure by A. Raban, this structure was used during the Iron Age and may have been built even earlier. Artifacts found in Area D which deserve special mention are a cup in the shape of a negro's head and a zoomorphic vessel in the shape of a sheep, both of the Roman period. (Communicated by Ephraim Stern) Tel Gezer, 1984* From 3 June to 6 July excavations were conducted at Tel Gezer on behalf of the Hebrew Union College and the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeology Research in Jerusalem. The excavations were funded principally by the University of Arizona and the National Geographic Society, with assistance from Southeastern Baptist Seminary. W.G. Dever was director and B. Elmo Scoggin was associate director. Eight supervisory staff members from the University of Arizona were joined by some thirty volunteer workers from Southeastern Seminary. Logistical support was generously provided by Kibbutz Gezer and by the American expedition to Lahav. The major achievement of the 1984 season was to resolve the long-standing controversy over the date of Gezer's Outer Wall', assigned in the 1964-1974 excavations to the LB II but placed in the Iron Age II or even in the Hellenistic period by others. After the removal of Macalister's dumpheaps and the probing of the outer face to bedrock, the Outer Wall' was revealed; it consists of some fourteen courses and stands about 6.4 m. high. It proved to have two phases. The lower three to four courses of larger boulders are clearly pre-tenth century B.C.E. This earlier wall was retrenched, probably to check its footings, in the tenth century B.C.E., when the upper ten or so courses of small and better dressed stones were added. Also at this time, an ashlar tower measuring about 2 X 3 m. was constructed, bonded into the upper wall courses, Overlying this tower, probably destroyed in the late tenth century B.C.E., were buttresses of the Iron Age II and Hellenistic period, when the connecting wall between the ashlar tower and the *Cf./?./24(1974),pp. 134-135.</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND NEWS 65 'Gatehouse' (see below) continued to be a vulnerable point. Inside the Outer Wall', a deep trench encountered the MB 'Inner Wall' and glacis upslope. This was almost identical to the exposure in Field I, with the 'Outer Wall' set into the glacis. Farther upslope, the section continued through the casemate wall, dated by sherd material to the tenth century B.C.E. Above subterranean retaining walls and deep fills containing hand-burnished sherds of the mid tenth century B.C.E., Macalister's 'Gatehouse' was founded. This outer two-entryway gate was of fine ashlar masonry, even in the drain concealed within the south wall. It was connected with the upper courses of the Outer Wall' to the east via the ashlar tower, and was closed to the west by a fragment of what seems to be a city wall 2.5 m. wide. Between the 'Gatehouse' walls a heavy cobbled sub-street and roadway ran upslope to the inner, four-entryway gate excavated in 1967-1970 in Field III. In the lowest levels dug below the 'Gatehouse' and ashlar tower there appeared several architectural elements that probably belong to an LB II defence system. These included a plastered ramp and a large curving stone revetment. The evidence suggests that the Solomonic engineers built their typical four-entryway gate and casemate wall in a breach in a destroyed stretch of the 'Outer Wall', reusing part of the wall. Elsewhere, they repaired the 'Outer Wall' by simply inserting a series of ashlar towers (as Macalister had observed). A second objective was to investigate a building immediately west of the upper four entryway gate in Field III. Here we excavated two phases of a large structure shown on Macalister's plans to be similar to Yadin's tenth century B.C.E. 'Palace 6000' at Megiddo. The upper phase consisted of an eighth-century B.C.E. courtyard and casemate building measuring about 18 X 36 m., with several rooms. It probably served as a combination residence barracks adjoining the city-gate. Restorable pottery in one of the two guardrooms and from a badly burned casemate shows that this structure was destroyed in the Assyrian conquest of Gezer in c. 734 B.C.E. The lower structure was of large, rough ashlar masonry, badly destroyed and robbed. Quantities of fine white wall plaster, together with some mid to late tenth-century B.C.E. pottery, were found in the debris. The walls of the two guardrooms, which had originated here and had been reused in the ninth-eighth centuries B.C.E., still stood over 2 m. high. A large open courtyard lay to the west, in one corner of which was found an olive press. It consisted of a large stone basin with two side run-off grooves leading to two storage-jars set flush into a plastered floor. This building, of which only a small portion could be excavated, was probably a combination administrative centre-barracks constructed simultaneously with the Solomonic city gate, and apparently destroyed with it in Shishak's raid, c. 920 B.C.E. (Communicated by W.G. Dever) Jerusalem, City of David, 1984* The seventh season of excavations was conducted between 2 July and 3 August, on behalf of the City of David Society. Director of the expedition is Y. Shiloh of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Area super visors were D.T. Ariel, Jane Canili, A. De Groot, Elat Mazar, Y. Shoham and D. Tarier. Other staff included G. Lipton and W. Schleicher (surveyors), Aida Fuller (photographer), Tamar Shiloh (camp and registration), Y. Deran (administrator) and Phyllis Amburn (restorer). This season's work concentrated on four excavation areas: D2, El, E3 and G. As in past seasons, the excavations were also assisted by university-sponsored groups from Ambassador College, California (supervised by R. Page) and the University of California at San Diego (supervised by R. Friedman). Area D2 is located in the southern part of the City of David, between Areas E2 and Dl. It is bounded on the west by the Iron Age city-wall and on the east by the 7-11 m. wide Hellenistic terrace. Excavation here had three objectives: clarification of the nature of the Hellenistic terrace; clarification of the course of the Iron Age * Cf. IEJ 34 (1984), pp. 57-58.</page><page sequence="14">66 NOTES AND NEWS city-wall at the southern end of the excavation area; and the understanding of a series of Iron Age II extramural structures, fragments of which had been discovered in the previous season. This season an additional 14 m. stretch of the Hellenistic terrace wall was revealed, bringing its known length to 29 m.; it is preserved to a height of 2.5 m. The terrace wall system is tentatively dated by the pottery in the earthen fills to Stratum 7B (Hasmonean). The Iron Age city-wall line was traced to its southern extremity, where it borders Areas D2 and Dl. There it runs up to the 2.5 m. high bedrock scarp situated beneath the line of the 'First Wall', where the latter runs along the crest overlooking the eastern slope. At this point the Iron Age city-wall undoubtedly ran southwards atop the bedrock; however, all traces of its line have disappeared farther south, most likely as a result of its being superceded by the Hellenistic 'First Wall', built atop the bedrock scarp and running to the area of pools at the extreme end of the City of David. An 18 m. stretch of this later wall was revealed here in 1978. Eight squares, comprising an area of 200 sq.m., were opened along an area of the bedrock shelf immediately outside and adjacent to the Iron Age fortifications. Within them two units could be clearly discerned. Parallel to the city wall, and 1-2.5 m. from it, was constructed a stone wall 1.2 m. thick, thus far revealed for a length of 31 m. Between it and the city-wall an orderly fill had been deposited to a height level with the bedrock outcrop. The nature of this elongated unit, which was attached to the city wall from the outside during the eighth century B.C.E., is not yet clear, as it is not an independent addition to the city's fortifications, but is rather related to an additional, large structure appended to it on the east. This structure, whose dimensions are 7 X 14 m., is composed of a number of parallel long rooms. Its location, regular plan and quality of construction suggest that it functioned in a public capacity, perhaps as a storehouse serving the needs of the agriculturalists who tended nearby plots of land in the Kidron Valley. The pottery assemblage from this and other Iron Age II buildings situated on the extramural bedrock shelf testifies to their use during the eighth century B.C.E. (Stratum 12). They were most likely abandoned on the eve of the siege of Sennacherib in 701 B.C.E. and were not subsequently reused. The north-western corner of the above mentioned building was disturbed in the course of the Persian or early Hellenistic period (Stratum 8) by a round, columbarium-like structure, 4.8 m. in diameter. Inside the latter were preserved eight niches. The eastern half of the structure was destroyed by the construction of the eastern wall of the Hellenistic - Hasmonean terrace system (Stratum 7). Area El. Investigation was concentrated in this area on two targets: completing the excavation of the 'Ashlar Building' atop the upper terrace, and completing the excavation of the pre-Iron Age II remains along the lower terrace. In the 'Ashlar Building', excavation of the rear unit was completed (PI. 12:A). Its south-western corner was preserved to a height of 3.5 m. above the floor-level. After the removal of later disturbances comprising Roman-Hellenistic dumps and a deep pit from the Persian period, two hard-packed lime floors and the fill beneath them were reinvestigated. The results again demonstrated that this structure was built during Stratum 11 (seventh century B.C.E.) and was destroyed with the rest of the city at the end of Stratum 10. On the lower terrace, inside and next to the city-wall, was found an additional, massive building constructed in Stratum 11. Its walls could be traced by following their foundation trenches, as these disturbed the Stratum 12 (eighth century B.C.E.) structures. Also completed was the excavation of a large building with clay floors, above which was tenth century B.C.E. pottery. Immediately beneath it were additional walls and floors dating from the early stages of the MB IIB (Strata 18-17), some relating to the base of the city-wall which was constructed in this period. An additional narrow, internal buttress was also discovered, similar to that found a little farther south in the same area. These had been attached to the city-wall during its second structural phase, Stratum 18A. One of the rooms from this period contained many small finds, including a stone seal, beads, two folded pieces of gold leaf and incised bone plaques decorated with geometrical patterns or cutouts of bird figures (PI. 12:B).</page><page sequence="15">NOTES AND NEWS 67 Area E3. The stratigraphy of this area is identical to that of Area El; some of the MB IIB and Iron Age II structures are shared by these two areas. Building 1937 was revealed in its entirety down to its foundations. Some of the walls were founded directly on the bedrock; in other cases they rested directly on earlier walls of either the MB IIB or the tenth century B.C.E. This structure ? like the 'Ashlar Building' in Area El and the columbarium-like construction in Area E3 ? was built in Stratum 11 (seventh century B.C.E.). These three point to a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon, i.e. that in Stratum 11 a number of buildings with massive walls were constructed on the eastern slope of the City of David. Building activity was intense not only in Stratum 12 but also during the seventh century B.C.E. Beneath the scanty evidence of Stratum 14, excavation this season in most squares of Area E3 next to the city-wall revealed more substantial remains belonging to the MB IIB (Strata 18-17). Some walls were connected to the base of the early city wall. On the bedrock a number of wall stubs from the EB I (Stratum 20) were revealed. Area G. This season the north-western corner of the area was cleaned. The major element of the area is the fortification line which served as the 'First Wall' during the Second Temple period. Secondary use had been made of the 'Northern Tower' ? excavated down to its foundations by Macalister?no earlier than the Early Islamic period, when two plastered pools were built over it. The tower itself may have been built during Strata 7-6, in the Second Temple period. It was built against the city-wall, where there are at least two pre-tower phases. The later phase was characterized by soft limestone blocks dressed with a broad chisel in a manner similar to well known sections of the Hasmonean 'First Wall'. The earlier phase of the fortification, built on the bedrock and preserved to a height of 2.4 m., was constructed of hard limestone laid in successively receding courses somewhat reminiscent of the stone stepped structure (tenth century B.C.E.). It is possible that this portion of the fortification may indeed belong to the same stratum as the latter and have originally been part of the City of David's citadel. Restoration work on the City of David Archaeological Garden is being carried out by the Jerusalem Foundation under the direction of architect N. Melzer. The supporting infrastruc ture has been completed in Area G and the restoration of the ancient structures and design of access routes to the site are under way. An entrance to the ancient tunnel of Warren's Shaft is now being excavated. The incorporation of Areas E and D in the Archaeological Garden is being planned. (Communicated by Yigal Shiloh) Tel Miqnef 1984* The first major excavation season at Tel Miqne (Ekron) was conducted from 8 July to 17 August, expanding the research programme initiated in 1981 and 1982. The joint American / Israeli project was sponsored by the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Boston College, in affiliation with the American Schools of Oriental Research and the Israel Exploration Society.

Mashiah, Kibbutz Revadim logistical liaison N. Aidlin and directors T. Dothan and S. Gitin. The 1984 season had five main objectives: (l)to complete the occupational profile of the north-eastern acropolis in Field INE, the sounding begun in 1981; (2) to determine the extent of the mud-brick city-wall in a new probe on the eastern slope of the mound, Field I SE, 30 m. south of Field I NE; (3) to establish the historical context of the main Iron Age II features in Field III SE; (4) to determine if the profile of the mound was the same in antiquity as it is today by opening three probes; and (5) to provide a large enough sample of environmental data from all fields of excavation for systematic analysis. Field I NE (Field I SE) Phases 13,12, and 11, the Late Chalcolithic, EBI and II and MB A-B, were again attested by ceramic and lithic finds from mixed fills below the occupation levels of the Iron Age. However, for the first time there was stratified evidence for the MB II. In the deepest probe in Area 7, a stone bin lined with plaster was associated with a surface with MB II sherds. In a probe 30 m. east of Field I NE, well beneath the cotton fields and partially below the water-level, a large mud-brick wall with stone battering was uncovered which may tentatively be associated with the MB II. This new feature extends the previously known fortified limits of the site, at least on its eastern face, and proves that the Philistines were not the first to fortify the site. It also shows that the mound in the second millennium B.C.E. was at least 4 m. higher than it is today. This was confirmed by the evidence from two other geological probes, which indicate that the present low profile of the mound was formed in the Byzantine period. Phase 10, the LB I and II, was attested for the first time by stratified occupation phases. In Area 7, immediately above the MB II phase, a surface with LB I pottery may be associated with the beginning of Phase 10. The end of Phase 10 was indicated in Area 6 by a plaster-lined silo with adjacent mud-brick construction and in Area 5 by a floor on which restorable vessels were found in situ covered by a heavy destruction layer. The Iron Age I mud-brick city-wall (Phase 9) was built directly over both these LB elements. Phase 9, whose major feature was the mud brick Iron Age I city-wall excavated in 1981 and 1982, was further clarified. The new data for the end of the LB proved conclusively which was the first surface used with the Iron Age I city-wall. In the pottery associated with this surface in Area 5, only plain wares were found. However, Mycenaean UIC :1b forms were found in the fill which covered this surface. As for the city-wall itself, its presence in the new sounding I SE and the mud-brick fortifications uncovered in Field III SE suggest that the city-wall probably ran around the entire mound, encompassing an area of 50 acres. Phase 8 was attested by a well-stratified sequence of surfaces and stone walls. The earlier surface in this sequence yielded no Philistine Bichrome ware but did produce a rich assemblage of Mycenaean IIIC:lb pottery. The second phase contained both Mycenaean UIC :1b and Philistine Bichrome wares. In the last phase only Philistine Bichrome pottery appeared together with Iron Age I plain wares. The evidence from Phase 8, assigned to the twelfth-eleventh centuries B.C.E., shows the typological development from Mycenaean UIC :1b to Philistine Bichrome pottery. Phases 7 and 6, dated to the eleventh century B.C.E., were attested in Areas 2 and 3 by fragments of surfaces, walls and tabuns. Adjacent to the cultic installation in Area 3 and associated with it were two large worked stones, one of which had a deep semi-circular head-like depression. These finds support the evidence from the previous excavation seasons, which indicated that this was a cultic area. Phase 5, dated to the tenth-ninth centuries B.C.E., is thus far attested only by pottery. The architectural features previously thought to belong to Phase 5 are now understood as construction elements of a Phase 4 drain. The city of this period was undoubtedly located elsewhere on the mound, perhaps in a smaller area than that of the Iron Age I city. Phase 4, dated to the eighth century B.C.E., is the earliest Iron Age II occupation phase defined by architectural features. In addition to the monumental architecture excavated previously, a large well-built drain was uncovered in Areas 2 and 3.</page><page sequence="17">NOTES AND NEWS 69 Phase 3, the final occupation phase in this field, for which no new evidence was found in 1984, should be redefined chronologically in light of the pottery found in Field III SE. Several forms are typologically related to those of Field I NE and range from the late eighth through the seventh centuries B.C.E. Thus, the pottery associated with Phase 3 is better understood as being within the, eighth-seventh centuries rather than being exclusively assigned to the late eighth century. Consequently, the end of Phase 3 may not be attributed to Sennacherib's campaign in 701 B.C.E. Field III SE As in Field I NE, ceramic evidence of the Chalcolithic through the LB was found in mixed fills below the Iron Age occupation levels. In the Iron Age, two periods were represented by well defined architectural units. The earliest of these, Iron Age I, had four components: an east-west city-wall 3.25 m. wide with an offset and lower platform, all of mud brick, and a massive stone tower. Laid up against the outer face of the wall and tower and covering the platform was a thick, sharply angled revetment of compacted fill, sealed by a plaster surface which may have served as a water run-off device like the artificial slope for the Iron Age I mud-brick city-wall in Field INE. This entire unit may have been part of a fortification system with a monumental entrance. The evidence for dating it, thus far, is based on its latest construction element ? the revetment. This contains a large homogeneous assemblage of Iron Age I plain and Philistine Bichrome wares, similar to those of Phases 7 and 6 in Field I NE, and can be assigned to the twelfth-eleventh centuries B.C.E. While the construction and first use-phase of the city-wall may well be linked to Phases 9 and 8 in Field I NE, dated to the twelfth century B.C.E., these levels have not yet been reached in Field III SE. The second Iron Age phase which produced significant architectural units was Iron Age /C, the eighth-seventh centuries B.C.E. The Iron Age IIA, the tenth-ninth centuries B.C.E., was attested only by sherds in mixed fills, as in Field I NE. The primary architectural units in the Iron Age IIB/C were a fortification system and an industrial area. The fortifications were composed of a city-wall, a gate and a gate house. The city-wall, constructed of stone, had three to four rows and eight preserved courses. Extending along the southern, eastern and western slopes of the mound, it was founded in the revetment of the Iron Age I city-wall. The 4 m. wide gateway, located in the city-wall at about the middle of the southern slope and founded on elements of the Iron Age I fortifications, was flanked on either side by stone construction. The eastern half of the gateway, the only part excavated, had at least two phases. The lower phase contained a gate with three piers and two cells, dated to the eighth-seventh centuries B.C.E. on the basis of the pottery of the road surface with which it was in use. In the upper phase of the gate, the southernmost cell was filled in with stone rubble connecting piers one and two and forming a 6 X 6 m. tower. The second cell between piers two and three may still have been in use at this time. The latest pottery from the road surface associated with this phase was of the seventh century B.C.E. The gate entrance may have had an additional phase in which the second cell was filled in with stone rubble and a large vat-like stone container, originally part of an olive press installation, was placed in its entrance. The third and northernmost pier was shaved down and covered with a layer of cobbles. As a result, probably only the tower protected the entrance through the city-wall. The gate house, opposite the entrance to the city, although not yet excavated, was clearly a large structure of two rooms and a thick outer wall which could have had no other purpose but to protect the entrance to the city. The second primary architectural unit in the Iron Age IIB/C is the industrial area for olive oil production (Fig. 1). Located east of the gate, it had three rooms, two of which were excavated to their floor-levels and one which was only partially exposed. These rooms belong to a building complex, the southern part of which was founded directly on top of the Iron Age I mud-brick city wall. The southernmost room, enclosed on three sides by stone walls with a mud-brick superstructure, was divided into two areas. The western section had in its southern corner a well preserved olive-press installation with a large crushing basin flanked on either side by a press. On the floor, several metres from and about</page><page sequence="18">70 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 1. Tel Miqne, reconstruction of olive-press installation. 0.6 m. below the top of the press, were seven large perforated rectangular stone weights and burnt remains of wooden levers (PI. 10:A). A limestone palette, a Phoenician figurine, a bronze juglet and dozens of whole vessels were found in situ on the floor. The eastern section of the room may have been used as a storage area, as many restorable jars were found there. The entire room was covered by a massive layer of destruction debris of burnt mud bricks and plaster from the walls and roof. The debris, composed of multiple layers, contained about 80 restorable ceramic vessels which appeared to have fallen from wall shelves when the building was destroyed. The northern room was enclosed on its west and east by stone walls with a mud-brick superstructure. Its southern end probably opened to the adjacent room and its northern side has not yet been fully excavated. The area was divided almost in half by a stone and mud-brick partition wall. The floor of the western half of the room contained scores of restorable pottery vessels, while the eastern half produced almost no artifacts at all. Sunk into the floor in the south western corner was a storage-jar which contained nine well-preserved iron agricultural tools. In the north-eastern part of the room a large rectangular perforated stone (a masevah or stable pillar) stood upright; immediately to the east of it were a raised stone platform and a limestone niche with two sides and a base. On the floor in front of the niche lay a perfectly preserved limestone horned altar which had apparently fallen from the niche. This cultic installation and its close proximity to</page><page sequence="19">NOTES AND NEWS 71 the olive-press have broad implications for understanding the relationship of cult and industry in the Iron Age II. The destruction of the industrial complex occurred close to the time of the demise of the Kingdom of Judah. Assyrian and biblical texts note that Ekron remained a Philistine city until the end of the seventh century B.C.E., when its occupation ended as a result either of the Egyptian invasion of Judah by Pharaoh Necho or of the Babylonian conquest. This date is confirmed by the homogenous pottery assem blage in the loci sealed beneath the destruction debris. The new data for the Iron Age from Ekron are important for the development of a better understanding of the material culture and economic system of the Philistines especially during the first half of the first millennium B.C.E.

Batty a de Miroschedji was again in charge of the administration. Three labourers and 85 volunteers, mostly from France, participated in the work. Excavations were continued in the western part of the lower city in five areas (C, D, E, F and G). A sixth area (H) was opened some 250 m. farther north, towards the centre of the lower city. Area C. The goals of the excavations were to trace the limits of the complex of the so-called 'White Building' (EB III) and reach in the south west the underlying EB II levels. The removal of the walls of Level C-III have revealed the complex of the White Building as it appeared after its abandonment at the end of Level C-IV. Since the floors of Levels C-V, C-IV and C-IIIB are separated by layers of only 5-20 cm., it is obvious that the various constructions surrounding the White Building were built in quick succession. The enlargement of the excavation area by 160 sq.m. towards the north and north-east was intended to clear the approach to the White Building. A passage paved with large flat stones was exposed to the east. It leads to a paved doorway 1.75 m. wide which opened into a room built around the south-eastern corner of the White Building; it is possible that this was the entrance to the entire complex. Most interesting results were obtained in the north, where a number of brick walls ascribed to Levels C-IV, C III and C-II were uncovered. Three walls belong to a large construction perhaps contemporaneous with the White Building; they are 1 m. thick, at least 1.5 m. high and one of them is 13 m. long. They may well be part of another public building, whose size and plan remain to be determined. The constructions immediately overlying can be ascribed to Level C-III. The most remarkable is a large room with plastered walls and floor. As elsewhere in Area C, Level C-II is represented by thick walls built with foundation trenches. No coherent plan could be recognized owing to erosion and later robbing, but the scale of the remains confirms that at least one large building occupied this part of the site in EB HIB. Two floors of this level were preserved; they yielded a large amount of EB HIB pottery and a small human figurine representing a man holding a vase(?) in his outstretched arms (Pl. 11 :A). Since the White Building is to be preserved, the only area available for excavation in the EB II levels is in the south-west, along the city-wall. Here, EB II material appears immediately under * Cf. IEJ 34 (1984), pp. 194-197.</page><page sequence="20">72 NOTES AND NEWS the floors of Level C-V; the transition seems to be abrupt. The excavations revealed first several pits, then the remains of two poorly built walls, then a well-preserved floor, and finally the top of a wall 1 m. thick and more than 1 m. high, undoubtedly belonging to a massive construction. In sum, this area of the city apparently had a special function, as it seems to have been occupied continuously from EB II to EB HIB by large constructions which were probably public buildings. Area G. This new area is located some 70 m. to the south-east of Area C, close to Area ? south of A. Ben-Tor's excavations in 1970. Devoted to the excavation of EB HI private houses, it extended this year over 112.5 sq.m. The remains brought to light are the corner of a building and, above it, part of a dwelling unit comprised of at least four rooms. The construction method is aggregative, i.e. suc cessive rooms were added by the construction of new walls; hence, the corners of two rooms were linked by a wall which closed the space between them, and another wall was built against the preceding one in order to create a fourth space. The rooms contain a pillar-base and are connected by doors with paved threshold and a door socket. In one room was found a small installation made of flat stones laid vertically which could have been used for the placing of a storage-jar. On the floor of the adjacent room were a crushed pithos and sherds dating perhaps from the EB HIB. Later, one room of this house was subdivided by a wall while a pavement (a street?) was laid on a terrace to the east, 0.7 m. lower. Area H. Situated on a small terrace more than 200 m. to the north-east of Area G, on the other side of the large depression which occupies the centre of the lower city, Area was opened around the spot where a strong magnetic anomaly was recorded by the resistivity survey. We expected to find here the remains of a kiln. The magnetic anomaly corresponds to a mass of burnt clay about 1.5 m. in diameter which appears on the surface of the mound. It belongs to a structure whose arrangement and function is still unknown because it is not yet completely excavated; to judge from the abundance of EB III coarse ware found in its immediate vicinity, it could well be a domestic kiln. This structure is located in a large and carefully constructed building of which only the western part has been cleared to date (Level -III). Its western wall has been exposed for a length of 14 m.; neither its limits nor an opening have been found. Perpendicular walls resting against its inner face form at least four rooms, one occupied by the kiln(?). A dozen crushed EB HI vessels (among them a twin vase) were recovered on the plastered floor of the adjacent room. The building was bordered by a passageway 2.75 m. wide which follows the edge of the terrace. A bifurcation to the south may mark the beginning of a ramp leading to the terrace immediately below. After its abandonment and destruction, this building was covered by a construction (Level H II) of which the only remnant identified to date is a wall appearing on the surface of the mound and of unknown date. It was finally covered by a tumulus measuring 5.6 m. X 4.9 m., an almost circular structure made of large stones, many of which are laid vertically in concentric circles. One can distinguish in the middle a sort of cist formed by smaller stones laid vertically and often displaced; this shallow cavity (0.6 m. deep) contained neither bones nor sherds. In the absence of any precise indication, it is impossible to date this tumulus, although it is certainly later than the EB IV (MB I). Area E (previously Area A south). Since the general plan of the gate is now reasonably clear, the aim of the excavation is to expose this monumental complex and to establish its precise chronology (PI. 11 :B). Outside the gate, the initial ramp (470) of Phase IA was further exposed; since it rises with a moderate slope, one can estimate that it reached the gate passage at about 2.5 m. above bedrock. In order to identify floors connected to the ramps of the first phase (470 and 144), a probe was excavated in the inner part of the gate. Bedrock was reached at 7 m. below the present surface. The sterile chalk layers of the Phase II fill are 3 m. thick and rest on a smooth surface which may correspond to Ramp 144. This surface covers another layer of sterile and chalky fill 0.8 m. thick, where no floor likely to match Ramp</page><page sequence="21">NOTES AND NEWS 73 470 could be identified. Lower down were 2.45 m. of layers of ashy earth containing many EBII sherds; these layers contained no floor although they correspond to Rampart 125, whose inner face was cleared to a height of 4 m. Two other soundings outside the gate provided additional data on the relative chronology of the constructions of this area. The base of Wall 133, the last of the retaining walls of the ramps leading to the gate, was reached at 0.5 m. above bedrock, resting on a plastered surface which was later cut by the foundation trench of'Bastion' 130. Based on bedrock, the latter is preserved to a height of 5.5 m., probably its original height as the remains of a pavement with traces of plaster were observed on its flat top. The outer face of Rampart 125 was exposed to its full height (6.8 m.). From the third course of stone upwards it tilts through about 1 m. As the 'Bastion' rests vertically against it, it is clear that this was in fact a reinforcement built in extremis to prevent the collapse of the rampart. It is not known whether this should be ascribed to an earthquake or to the pressure exerted from the inside of the gate by some 6 m. of earth fill. It probably accounts for the final closure of the gate marked by the construction of Platform 440 (Phase IV). Area F. The discovery here of a city-gate through the outer city-wall led us to postulate the existence in the same vicinity of another, older gate in the inner city-wall (131). The excavations in Area F are intended to identify this early city gate and to establish the line of Rampart 131. The latter does not turn to the south, as was conjectured on the basis of the resistivity survey, but continues to the south-east in a straight line. It has a buttress 2.6 m. deep and at least 15 m. long; assuming that the inner face remains straight, the wall widens here from 5.6 m. to 8.2 m. The continuation of the stone terracing of Phase IV of the fortifications was found; how ever, the wall limiting the upper terrace ends with a curvilinear line and abuts the buttress of the rampart. This feature may be indicative of an end to the terracing, and thus of an opening (a gate?) in the rampart a few metres to the south. Area D. A major outstanding problem is the lay out of the fortifications in the western corner of the city, especially the junction between the inner city-wall uncovered in Area C and that exposed in Area D. This season's excavations have revealed that the EB II inner city-wall has a large buttress 7 m. deep and of unknown length (more than 12 m.). The EB II layers of ashy earth resting against it are sealed by a plastered surface which is in turn covered by a fill of sterile and chalky earth. The rampart is here 9 m. thick. Its inner face was found robbed to a depth of more than 2 m. (and not buried under a collapse, as was previously assumed); it is preserved only for four courses of stone and based some 15 to 25 cm. above bedrock, i.e. as in Area A. This confirms that the site had been occupied for a long time when the first city-wall was erected at the beginning of EB II. The north-western corner of a rectangular platform 25 X 10 m. built with deep foundation trenches has been uncovered one metre in front of the buttress of the rampart. This new monumental platform, the seventh identified up to now in this part of the city, rests against Platform 305. It is not known what is the latter's chronological relationship to the new platform, whose function also remains enigmatic. (Communicated by Pierre de Miroschedji) Newe Noy Between July and December 1983, salvage excavations were conducted on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums as part of the Negev Emergency Project, directed by Y. Baumgarten and Iris Eldar. The site is located in the Newe Noy suburb of Beer Sheva (map. ref. 129 171), some 150 m. east of Chalcolithic Bir Safadi, excavated by J. Perrot in 1953. The present site is likewise of the Chalcolithic period and consists of at least eight subterranean units dug into the loess soil, extending over an area of about 300 X 100 m., bounded in the north by Nahal Beer Sheva, and in the south by Nahal Beqa'. The condition of the excavated units was uneven; the best preserved was located in the east. Here three phases of construction were discerned; these attest to structural alterations (in which mud-brick walls were added to the courtyard, new galleries opened, copper-industry</page><page sequence="22">74 NOTES AND NEWS installations introduced, etc.) rather than occupational levels. The largest of the underground rooms was complete and undistur bed. Oval in shape, it measured 5 X 25 m. and 1.75 m. in height. Its roof was pitched and chisel marks were still visible on the walls. Two galleries led from this chamber to the courtyard, which, in its earliest phase, contained two hearths and a silo. Of particular note was a courtyard about 150 m. to the south of this unit. In the second of its three phases, a small krater (rim 16 cm. in diameter) was sunk into the centre of its floor, with its rim protruding several centimetres above the surface. It had evidently been subjected to intense heat, as the surrounding soil was of pottery-like hardness. A tyr?e or bellows tube lay beside the krater, confirming its identification as a crucible for the copper industry. The three stones located next to the northern entrance may have served as work table, mortar and anvil. Five copper objects were discovered bound together: two sceptres and two axe heads, all fastened with a broad, bracelet-like band (a 'crown' fragment?) which had snapped (PI. 11:D). They are par ticularly important, being clearly related to the assemblage discovered by P. Bar-Adon in 1962 in the Cave of the Treasure. Other finds included a small pendant of copper wire with a loop in the middle and spiral rings on both sides, copper awls, grinding stones, and mortars. The pottery finds at Newe Noy were slim, but the substantial number of churn fragments and other diagnostic sherds clearly assign the site to the fourth-millennium B.C.E. Beer Sheva culture. Other artifacts include adzes and flint and copper axes, stone mortars, bone tools, faience beads, and mother-of-pearl ornaments. In the final phase of the settlement, a number of structures used for burial contained several disarticulated skeletons of men, women and children. (Communicated by Rudolph Cohen) Shiqmim, 1984* The Shiqmim Expedition is a long-term multidisciplinary project which focuses on the study of changes in protohistoric social organization and subsistence strategies during the Chalcolithic period in the northern Negev. The 1984 season marked the conclusion of Phase I of the archaeological investigation of the large (9.5 hectares) Chalcolithic village. This site (map ref. 115 067 is one of the largest fourth-millennium sites in Israel and the only Chalcolithic village in the Negev yet found associated with burial grounds. The co-directors of the project are D. Alon and T. Levy, on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums and the Negev Museum, Beer-Sheva. The core staff of the expedition included the following specialists: geology ? P. Goldberg; archaeozoology ? Caroline Grigson; archaeobotany ? M. Kislev; physical anthropology ? B. Arensberg and T. Hershkovitz. The field supervisors include: Nadine Menahem; Area ? Claire Peachy; Area C ? N. Slope and G. Wyncoll; Area D ? S. Thompson and S. Kangas; Area E ? Y. Goren and P. Fabian. Eileen McAndrew was the laboratory supervisor; T. Ludo vise served as the project's photographer. The staff surveyors and cartographers are M. Feist and I. Watkin. The 65 people that made up the expedition team camped along the north bank of the Wadi Beer Sheva from 18 September to 25 October 1984. During this period 50 squares of 5 X 5 m. each were opened in five excavation fields (A-E). This work doubled our excavation sample at Shiqmim. Area A. Chalcolithic cultural debris was discovered from the surface of the site to a depth of over 4 m. Shiqmim is thus the deepest stratified Chalcolithic settlement excavated in western Palestine. The only site of comparable depth is Teleilat Ghassul north-east of the Dead Sea, which also contains deposits about 4 m. deep. Another important archaeological observation is the fact that no preceding Neolithic material was found in the basal layers at Shiqmim. Area B. Excavations in 1983 had brought to light a hoard of complete pottery vessels and the head of an anthropomorphic statuette. The nature of these finds and their context suggested the possibility of finding some kind of cultic building in Area in 1984. This proved not to be the case. However, excavations in Area did produce new * Cf. IEJ 33 (1983), pp. 272-274.</page><page sequence="23">NOTES AND NEWS 75 insights concerning village planning at Shiqmim. Twenty new walls were uncovered in Area B, bringing the total in this area to 28. Two courtyards and three possible domestic housing units were found. These houses can all be classified as the smaller type of building structure found at Shiqmim (approximately 3.5 X 5.5 m.). Area can thus far be characterized as a residential area with an architectural layout conforming to the general north-east / south-west orientation of the entire village in Building Phase II. It now seems that the hoard of complete pottery vessels found in 1983 is an intrusive offering placed during the Phase I occupation in a breach in a Phase II wall, perhaps during the final abandonment of the village. Area C. Excavations were carried out primarily to define the function of two buildings discovered here in 1983 (Buildings 4 and 5). Lack of time prevented the complete excavation of Building 5; only the results from Building 4 will be discussed here. Building 4 belongs to the largest type of buildings discovered at Shiqmim to date. It measures 5 X 10.5 m. and was first constructed during the Building Phase II occupation at the site. Unlike the smaller buildings at the site, this structure contained very little domestic refuse such as animal bone, seed remains or flint debitage. Only a large grinding stone weighing about 50 kg., a small copper axe, a single smashed coarse ware pot and two pottery churns were found here, all on a plastered floor. This is the first plastered floor found at a Chalcolithic site in the Negev. The building may have functioned as a meeting place for social activities; the lack of domestic refuse seems to rule out the possibility that it was used as a family habitation unit. In a large area (100 sq.m.) opened to the north of this room, no architectural features were found, suggesting that a large open courtyard existed here. A small lane bordered by two parallel foundation walls discovered to the north east of Room 4 seems to have been an entrance into this courtyard. Two finely preserved copper tools, a large axe and an unusually long (22 cm.) chisel, were found hidden at the base of one of these walls. These seem to be functional copper objects which differ significantly from symbolic copper finds in previous campaigns at Shiqmim (e.g. a copper standard and copper mace head). The metal objects from Shiqmim are being examined by R. Maddin and J. Muhly. Area D produced the most significant architectural and cultural finds of the 1984 season. In 1983, a well-defined courtyard measuring about 5 X 8 m. was found in Area D. Inside the courtyard, a small room was found in the south-eastern corner which contained the remains of numerous flint flakes and cores and a collection of cow bones. It was clear that butchering activities were carried out here. One of the aims of the 1984 season was to examine the areas around this courtyard to see if any buildings could be found associated with it. An unusually well-preserved broad room was found extending along the northern end of the courtyard. The door socket of this room was found along the southern broad side of the room. Over 50 artefacts were found in situ on the hard packed mud floor of this room (Room 6). A number of objects found on the floor help us to identify many of the tasks carried out by the family unit. For example, tabular scrapers and a copper awl with a bone handle and two spare copper points indicate leather or hide working of some kind. A small grinding stone (about 6 kg.) indicates family preparation of wheat or barley flour. The bone remains of a cow (without butchering equipment) point to meat having been consumed but not butchered inside the house. These are only a few of the many activities carried out here. In addition to this domestic compound, an unusually large building measuring 4X 12 m. was found in Area D. It is similar in size to the long room excavated by J. Perrot at Bir Safadi in the early 1950's. The room (No. 13) was only partially excavated. However, like the large buildings found in Areas A and C, the domestic activities so clearly represented in the smaller rooms like No. 6 were not evidenced in the larger buildings. Area E provided insights into the architectural features discovered in Area D and into burial practices at Shiqmim. Excavations were extended to this portion of the site, to the east of Area D, to investigate the interface between the Upper and Lower Village areas. As this area is on a slope it has no doubt suffered from erosion. However,</page><page sequence="24">76 NOTES AND NEWS compared with the rest of the site very little evidence of building activities was found here. Remains of what appears to be a mud-brick surface (possibly a platform-like construction) were discovered. Thus, to the east of the large building (No. 14) there appears to have been a large open area. Excavations below this platform like surface revealed the first human burials discovered within the village. Three bodies were found buried in semi-flexed positions next to one another. The skeletons were in a fairly good state of preservation and can be identified on a preliminary basis as an adult male, an adult female and a juvenile. Of great interest is the fact that no burial offerings were found with these individuals. From our investigations in the Shiqmim cemetery, the only Chalcolithic mortuary site in the Negev known to date, it is clear that all burials were interred in well-built mortuary structures and included some kind of offering. Thus, the three burials in Area E without grave offerings are of great interest in terms of their social significance in relation to the burials found in the nearby cemetery. An unusual stone 'violin-shaped' figurine was found in a room in Area E (Pl. 11 :C). This is the first Chalcolithic violin-shaped figurine with well defined breasts to be found in Israel. A full discussion of this important find is forthcoming. (Communicated by Thomas Levy and David Alon) OBITUARIES Joseph D. Amusin was born at Vitebsk on 29 November 1910 and died in Leningrad on 12 June 1984. As a child he learned Hebrew with a private teacher who inspired him with an interest in ancient history and culture. In 1941 he graduated in history from Leningrad University; while still an undergraduate he published his first paper, 'Pushkin and Tacitus'. From 1941 to 1945 he served in the Soviet army. After the war he resumed his studies at the Oriental Institute under S. Luria and V.U. Struve, completing his doctorate in 1949. From 1950 to 1954 he taught ancient history at the Pedagogical Institute at Ulianovsk. In 1954 he returned to Leningrad as the assistant of A.I. Tiumenev; he was at the Institute of Oriental Studies from 1959 until his death. J.D. Amusin's field of interest was wide: the history of the Jewish people, the Bible as a source of information on the social and political life of the ancient Near East, the position of Jews in the Hellenistic-Roman periods, etc. With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls he devoted himself to this field of research. His publications in Russian include The Manuscripts of the Dead Sea (1960, 1961); The Discoveries near the Dead Sea (1964, 1965); The Qumran Texts (1971); The Qumran Community (1983). He also published papers on the position of the lower strata of society in ancient Palestine. In all his published work J.D. Amusin demonstrated his ability as a historian and as a philologist. He was always cautious in drawing conclusions and underlined the difficulties of the scholar faced by fragmentary and obscure texts. Pessah Bar-Adon, who died on 10 January 1985, was born in Poland in 1907 and received a traditional education which included study at yeshivot and at the Tahkemoni School. He immigrated to Palestine in 1925 and at first worked in road-building and construction. This was the beginning of a colourful and variegated career, for in the ensuing years Pessah was to be a student at the Hebrew University, a shomer both on foot in the city and on horseback in the fields, a Beduin living with tribes in the Golan and Galilee, a shepherd, a writer and painter, an active member of the Haganah and a resident of Moshav Merhaviah. He is best known as an archaeologist who devoted his later years to the study of the Judean Desert, conducting probes and excavations between 'Ein Feshkha and 'En Gedi. His archaeological career began in 1936, when he joined B. Mazar at Beth She'arim; he subsequently dug at Beth Yerah, Kinneret and Tell Qasile (with B. Mazar) and directed the excavations at Beth Yerah for six years beginning in 1949. He headed the expedition to Nahal Mishmar, one of the four regions investigated in the Judean Desert; in 1961 the well-known Chalcolithic 'treasure' was discovered there. From 1964 onwards he conducted surveys and excavations in the desert. Pessah Bar-Adon published books based on his experiences as a Beduin and a shepherd, together with stories for</page><page sequence="25">REVIEWS 77 young readers; his scholarly articles appeared in Collections in Israel (Atiqot [English Series] 4 Yediot, El and IEJ, but his name will chiefly be [19651).
