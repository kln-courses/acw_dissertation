<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is American Opposition to Whaling Anti-Japanese? DAI TANNO and TOSHIHIDE HAMAZAKI O ver the years, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has been transformed from a "whaling club" to a "preservation club" (Sigvaldsson 1996), with the United States among the countries that oppose the killing of whales (Derr 1997). One possible reason for this is that the stable U.S. econo- my has not suffered from banning commercial whaling (Nagasaki 1994). The anti-whaling stance of the United States is also attributed to an animal rights agenda that opposes the killing of any animals for human use (Butterworth 1992; Skfire 1994; Motluk 1996). Recent studies (Kalland 1993, 1998) have further proposed that the opposition to whaling is influenced by whale totemism (whales' occupying a unique symbolic place in the animal kingdom) and by world opinion. Whatever reasons underlie the opposition to whaling, the controversy is viewed as a war between good whale protectionists and evil whalers (Sumi 1989; Kalland 1993). In this framework, whaling is described as immoral (Callicott 1997), as slaughter (Hall 1988), or as equivalent to the genocide of inferior human beings (D'Amato and Chopra 1991). Whalers are also described as killers who defend their crimes or as illiterate vandals (Callicott 1997). Freeman and Kellert (1992) detected such opinions in their survey study of how people in six coun- tries viewed whaling. They found that the majority of those surveyed in non- whaling countries (Australia, England, Germany, and the United States) disap- proved of whaling and the consumption of whale meat, whereas the majority of respondents in whaling countries (Japan and Norway) responded in the opposite way. Thus it has been widely argued that the controversy over whaling is not about 81</page><page sequence="2">82 Asian Affairs science (whether or not sustainable whaling is feasible) but about the symbolic status of whales (whether or not whales are wildlife to be harvested) (Kalland 1993; Skire 1994). The Japanese have claimed for many years that the anti-whaling movement in the United States is an expression of anti-Japan sentiment (Sumi 1989). The claim deserves attention. Whether commercial or subsistence-oriented, several countries or ethnic groups, such as Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Japan, and the Alaskan Inuit, have long whale-hunting traditions. Of those, Norway and Japan are still engaged in large-scale whaling. Norway harvests whales commercial- ly under formal objection to the International Whaling Commission's morato- rium and annually takes about seven hundred minke whales in the North Atlantic Ocean (0.5 percent of the total population in the North Atlantic, which is approximately 149,000). Japan annually takes about four hundred minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean (0.05 percent of the total population in the Antarctic Ocean, which is approximately 761,000) (IWC 1998) for purposes of scientific research. Although Norway takes more minke whales than Japan, it is Japan's scientific whaling that anti-whaling groups oppose and that is often criticized by the U.S. mass media (Kalland 1998). For example, an environ- mental journal states that the Japanese "saw scientific research as a loophole, an ideal opportunity enabling them to circumvent the ban and resume com- mercial whaling under a different name" and argues that their research whaling is "a thinly-veiled excuse to provide whale meat for the country's gourmet restaurants" (Hall 1988, 207). Anti-whaling nongovernmental organizations scrutinize whale meat sold in Japan for evidence of illegal trade (IFAW 1999), but not that sold in Norway. In a similar vein, the Japanese practice of eating whale meat is often condemned as barbaric by the U.S. media (e.g., Glass and Englund 1989). That the anti-whaling movement targets Japan rather than Norway has fueled the Japanese suspicion that Americans are using the movement to vent their frus- tration about Japan's recent economic success. A publication of the Japan Whal- ing Association stated, "The whaling issue had become an outlet through which Americans felt free to express their amorphous but deep-seated anti-Japanese sen- timents" (Yamamoto 1985, 12). The Japanese commonly link the anti-whaling movement to racial issues between the two groups (Misaki 1994). A Japanese journalist wrote, "Here we have the opinion of one race forcing its ideas on the traditional eating habits of another" (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2 September 1984). Although some Americans call the conflicting views about whaling a "cultural gulf" (Glass and Englund 1991), some Japanese consider it "cultural imperial- ism" (Misaki 1994, 21). Some observers charge that U.S. anti-Japan sentiment is particularly mani- fest in economic domains (Kuroda 1989; Ohkita 1989; Sekishita 1989; Tyson 1992; Tanno, Hamazaki, and Takahashi 1996, 1997); however, whether it</page><page sequence="3">Is American Opposition to Whaling Anti-Japanese? 83 explains the anti-whaling movement is unclear. The study by Freeman and Kellert (1992) on six countries' public attitudes toward whaling provided little insight into the Japanese claim that the anti-whaling stance of Americans is anti-Japanese. However, one recent study of U.S. public opinion about whaling as compared with that of three other countries revealed that 73 percent of U.S. respondents (N = 698) knew little or nothing about whales and that 46 percent did not know the status of whale harvesting worldwide (Responsive Management 1998). In the same survey, 71 percent of the U.S. respondents supported the harvest of minke whales once they were informed that it was an aspect of the culture of some nations and groups of people and that the harvest would be regulated by the IWC. A survey of U.S. college students (N = 459) revealed that anti-whaling attitudes stem from the animal rights/welfare agenda, whale totemism, and cultural impe- rialism (Hamazaki and Tanno 1998). Those two studies led us to investigate what underlies the opposition of Americans to whaling by Japan, as compared with that by other ethnic groups or countries. The general purpose of our study was to discover whether the anti-whaling stance of Americans is another form of Japan bashing. To examine that issue, we formulated three research questions. The first was, Do Americans differentiate among the five whaling groups by having different reasons for approval or dis- approval of their whaling? We focused on the effects of the following four ele- ments: (a) the mass media, (b) animal rights, (c) whale anthropomorphism in place of whale totemism, and (d) ethnocentrism of the anti-whaling stance in place of cultural imperialism. In several other studies, those elements have been suggested as the major motivation for opposition to whaling (Butterworth 1992; Kalland 1993, 1998; Ris 1993; Misaki 1994; Sktre 1994; Hamazaki and Tanno 1998), but no previous study has ever tested their effects on Americans' views of whaling by Japan in comparison with other whaling groups. The second research question was, Do Americans differentiate among the five whaling groups in degree of approval or disapproval of whaling? The past atti- tudes of Americans and the U.S. media induced us to assume that Americans would favor some whaling groups over others. We thought that Americans would be unlikely to favor Japan over Norway and the other three groups, although we did not predict the degree of favor or disfavor with regard to each group. The third research question was, Do the males and females differ in their responses to the two research questions? Hamazaki and Tanno (1998) found that females tended to view whales as nonedible animals, whereas males tended to view them as edible. Although no study has examined gender differences in U.S. citizens' attitudes toward Japan, it is well known that gender differences exist regarding public policy (Wassenberg, Wolsborn, and Hanger 1983). A Gallup public survey also reported that females tended to disapprove of whaling more than males did (Gallup Canada 1992), which could be explained by the finding</page><page sequence="4">84 Asian Affairs that females tend to be less informed than males on public policy issues (Lovrich, Pierce, Tsurutani, and Abe 1985). Methods Instrument of Data Collection We developed an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire to collect data, which we saw as a better instrument than the face-to-face interview for obtaining candid responses to sensitive issues (Sudman and Bradburn 1982). The ques- tionnaire consisted of the following three components: (a) personal demograph- ic variables (gender, age, etc.), (b) a criterion variable (the degree to which a par- ticipant approves or disapproves of whaling by each of the five whaling groups), and (c) predictor variables (the mass media, animal rights, whale anthropomor- phism, and ethnocentrism of the anti-whaling stance). Criterion Variable We used the same statements for each whaling group: (a) The Alaskan Inuit should be allowed to hunt whales; (b) the Danish Greenlanders should be allowed to hunt whales; (c) the Icelanders should be allowed to hunt whales; (d) the Japan- ese should be allowed to hunt whales; and (e) the Norwegians should be allowed to hunt whales. Predictor Variables X The mass media. The U.S. media routinely portray whales as special crea- tures different from other marine animals. The special status attached to whales, also found in movies and publications for children, such as Nickelodeon maga- zine (Weingartner 1998) and a Berenstain Bear book (Berenstain and Berenstain 1994), may be imprinted on the mind from childhood. Participants in the study were asked to report what percentages of their information on whales and whal- ing issues they acquired from television, magazines, and books. X2: Animal rights. Based on the statements of several proponents of animal rights (Singer 1975; Regan 1985), we developed the following statements: (a) Animals have the right to be free from being killed or hunted; (b) it is not ethi- cal to hunt, kill, or eat animals; (c) animals should not be hunted or killed; (d) animals are resources that can be used to meet human needs. X3: Whale anthropomorphism. Kalland (1993) proposed "whale totemism" as an element motivating people to oppose whaling. However, his study did not sug- gest how to measure the concept. Based on the statements of several anti-whaling proponents (Barstow 1989; Glass and Englund 1989; D'Amato and Chopra 1991;</page><page sequence="5">Is American Opposition to Whaling Anti-Japanese? 85 Callicott 1997), we developed the following statements: (a) Whales are uniquely special compared with other animals; (b) whales can be called "people of the ocean"; (c) whales enrich our folklore; (d) whales are friendly; (e) whales are mar- velous; and (f) whales are marine resources that can be used to meet human needs (the response to the last statement was scored in reverse). These six items were designed to measure the degree to which people anthropomorphize whales. X4: Ethnocentrism of the anti-whaling stance. A group is ethnocentric in this context if it views its own attitudes against whaling as superior to the attitudes of whaling groups and tends to impose its view of whaling on other groups. Based on the statements of several opponents of whaling, we developed the following statements: (a) Hunting or eating whales is ethically wrong; (b) there is no wor- thy cultural or traditional value in whaling; (c) hunting or eating whales is bar- baric; (d) we should educate people in whaling countries on the nonconsumptive value of whales; (e) whaling is motivated solely by money and greed; () caring for whales is evolving as the norm among the nations of the world; and (g) the hunting and eating of whales are forms of cultural diversity (the response to the last statement was scored in reverse). Our measures of the last three construct variables (X2, X3, and X4) were com- posite indexes calculated by averaging the summed responses to a 7-point Likert scale ranging from I (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The statements were randomly arranged to minimize the impact of adjacent statements on index construction. Data Collection Procedures and Participants Although random sampling could be the best method of data collection for this type of study, we used a convenience sample composed of college students. In February 1998 we posted a notice of the survey on Internet listservs ECOLOG-L, maintained by the Ecological Society of America, and CONSBIO- L, maintained by the Society for Conservation Biology. Through the Internet, more than twenty instructors of biology-related courses volunteered to collect data in their classes. A package of questionnaire forms was mailed to each proctor (instructor) in April 1998. Proctors from twelve institutions (see acknowledgments) distributed the questionnaire to students of theirs who volunteered to respond. Some proctors collected the questionnaire from students in class; some collected the question- naire within a week, after the students had recorded their responses outside class. By the end of May, 448 usable replies were returned by the proctors: 177 male and 271 female. The response rate was about 50 percent. At each of the twelve institutions, female participants outnumbered males. The participants ranged from freshmen to graduate students; their mean age was 22.27 (SD = 5.38) for males and 21.82 (SD = 4.74) for females.</page><page sequence="6">86 Asian Affairs Construction of Indexes Because our measure of three predictor variables, with the exception of mass media, was a composite index calculated by averaging the summed responses to statements according to the 7-point Likert scale, a variance test (F max test) was executed on each of the three predictor variables. Each was found to meet the assumption that items to be summed into an index must have near-equal variance, enabling us to use each of the three predictor variables for further analysis. Once the assumption of the near-equal variance test was met, the internal con- sistency (Cronbach's alpha) was computed. Each of the construct variables was found to have a usable level of internal consistency: (a) animal rights, .75 for males and .79 for females; (b) whale anthropomorphism, .65 for males and .63 for females; and (c) ethnocentrism of anti-whaling stance, .70 for males and .73 for females (see table 1). Results Through multiple regression analyses, a clear picture emerged. Respondents of both genders opposed whaling by Japan for two reasons: whale anthropomor- phism (-.78, p &lt; .001 for males and -.43, p &lt; .001 for females) and ethnocen- trism of the anti-whaling stance (-.58, p &lt; .001 for males and -.35, p &lt; .001 for females). However, the participants did not differentiate the Japanese from the other whaling groups for special reasons. As was expected, the degree of oppo- sition differed by gender, as is indicated in the adjusted R-square (.38 for males and .27 for females). The results also indicate that the effects of the media and of the sense of animal rights were negligible (see table 2). The female respondents clustered the five whaling groups into two groups: the Alaskan Inuit and the others. Although the female participants disapproved of whaling by all the groups, they disapproved of Japan's whaling the most and that of the Alaskan Inuit the least. The male participants clustered the whalers into three groups: the Alaskan Inuit, the three European groups (Greenland, Iceland, and Norway), and Japan. Among the five groups, the male participants disap- proved of Japan's whaling the most and approved of the Alaskan Inuit's whaling the most (see table 3). No salient differences were found between the two gen- ders in their reasons for opposing whaling by Japan. The genders differed only in the degree of their opposition. Discussion In recent years, the U.S. media have often mentioned that the U.S.-Japan rela- tionship has become more harmonious because no controversial economic con- flict exists between the two countries, except for the issue of U.S. imports of</page><page sequence="7">Is American Opposition to Whaling Anti-Japanese? 87 Japanese steel. The news media also suggest that the focus of U.S. foreign poli- cy has shifted from Japan to Asia as a whole. In a sense, our study of American opposition to whaling serves as a litmus test for current American public senti- ment toward Japan. The results of our study run counter to the contention of the U.S. media that anti-Japan sentiments are a thing of the past. Rather, they show that American anti-whaling attitudes toward the five whaling groups are not as simple as they are assumed to be. Our findings permit us to suggest the following: First, Amer- icans oppose whaling by Japan for two reasons-whale anthropomorphism and ethnocentrism. This is at odds with the finding of a previous study (Tanno, Hamazaki, and Takahashi 1997), which suggested that ethnocentrism did not cause Americans to respond negatively to Japan's economic success. Second, a significant gender difference may exist in the degree of opposition to whaling by Japan-a finding similar to that of a Gallup public survey (Freeman and Kellert 1992). Third, the two reasons that Americans oppose whaling (whale anthropomorphism and ethnocentrism) do not explain why they differentiated among the five whaling groups and, in particular, why they disapproved of Japan's whaling the most. Fourth, the media had little effect on the anti-whaling stance of Americans. These four findings suggest that Americans would not want the Japanese to exceed other whaling groups in taking whales. It seems that Americans would not allow the Japanese to hunt whales under any circumstances. In a nutshell, even though Japan and the United States do not compete for whales as valued resources in international markets, Americans still object to Japanese whaling. Therefore, the Japanese claim that the anti-whaling stance of Americans is anti-Japanese cannot simply be discredited. However, two cautions should be noted. First, the participants in the study (col- lege students) do not necessarily represent the entire U.S. population. Second, the present findings are hardly the final answer to the Japanese claim. Additional, bet- ter-designed studies are necessary before our findings could be generalized to the entire U.S. population.
