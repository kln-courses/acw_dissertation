Brown Abstract Western scholars generally agree that early hadith critics limited their authentication of hadlths to examining isndds. The argument that these critics took the matn into account has relied on material of dubious reliability or on works produced after the formative period of the Sunni hadith tradition. By providing examples of matn criticism from the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries, I prove that Sunni hadith critics did in fact engage in matn criticism; and I argue that these critics consciously manufactured the image of exclusive focus on the isndd in an effort to ward off attacks by rationalist opponents. By demonstrating a high correlation between the hadlths found in early books of transmitter criticism and those found in later books of forged hadith with explicit matn criticism, I show that early critics engaged in matn criticism far more often than appears to have been the case, disguising this activity in the language of isndd criticism. Keywords matn criticism, hadith criticism, hadith forgery, al-Bukharl, Muslim b. al-Hajjaj, isnddy munkar Introduction Western scholars have accepted that early Muslim hadith scholars focused their efforts to determine the authenticity of reports attributed to the Prophet principally on their chains of transmission (isndd pl. asdnid) and ignored the key component of modern historical investigation: the contents of the reports themselves.

Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 have been entirely justified in this conclusion, as participants in the first four centuries of the Sunni hadlth tradition actively touted their obsession with the formal aspects of isndd criticism to the exclusion of any noteworthy interest in criticizing the contents of hadlths. The efforts of some Western scholars and modern Muslim apologists to prove that early hadlth critics did in fact look beyond the isndd have thus regularly foundered on the lack of any exculpatory evidence from the early Islamic period. In this article, I reevaluate our outlook on the methods of Sunni hadlth critics in the formative 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries, which encompassed the careers of influential critics such as Muhammad b. Ismail al-Bukharl (d. 256/870) and 'All b. 'Umar al-Daraqutnl (d. 385/995). First, I will provide examples of early critics explicitly rejecting hadlths as fraudulent on the grounds that their contents were unacceptable, proving that content criticism was an established component of their critical arsenal.1 Second, I will demonstrate that what has appeared to be the critically obtuse edifice of the early Sunni hadlth tradition - with its evident inability to perceive glaring anachronism or illogical meanings - does not accurately represent the reality of early hadlth criticism. Rather, an indifference to the contents of hadlths was an image consciously manufactured by early Sunni hadlth critics as an essential part of the cult of methodology they created around the isndd in the face of their rationalist op- ponents. Finally, I will demonstrate that when the Sunni hadlth tradition openly began to shift its attention from isndd criticism to 0 In discussions of hadlth criticism, the term 'matn criticism' has become conventional for indicating criticism of the text of the hadlth (as opposed to criticism of the chain of transmission, or isndd criticism). I believe the term 'content criticism' more accurately represents what Western scholars have meant by matn criticism, namely the notion that something in the contents or meaning o£ the hadlth is problematic. An early Muslim hadlth critic could criticize the matn of a hadlth without ever touching upon its meaning; a critic like al-Daraqutnl (d. 385/995) might object to the wording of one narration of a Prophetic tradition because it deviated from a more established version without the problematic narration's meaning differing at all. Of course, the term 'content criticism' here has no relation to the 'content criticism (SachkritikY employed in New Testament studies. See Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Criticism of the Proto-Hadith Canon: al-Daraqutnl's Adjustment of the Sahihayn," Journal of Islamic Studies 15, no. 1 (2004): 26; Edgar Krentz, The Historical Critical Method (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975), 71.</page><page sequence="3">J.A.C Brown /Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 145 content criticism in the 6th/ 12th century, hadith critics drew directly on the material that earlier critics ostensibly had criticized for isndd flaws. The significant correlation between the material that later critics rejected for content reasons and early isndd criticisms suggests that early hadith scholars employed content criticism far more often than would appear. The State of the Field on Early Hadith Criticism: Too Early or Too Late Western scholars of Islam can hardly be blamed for concluding that early hadith critics focused on isndd criticism to the exclusion of content criticism. Indeed, Islamic modernists such as Rashld Rida (d. 1935) and Jamal al-Banna have seconded this Orientalist critique.2 It was not until the late 4th/ 10th century that Muslim scholarship even produced a work devoted to listing forged or extremely un- reliable hadlths: the Kitdb al-mawdudt (Book of Forged Hadlths) (now lost) of Abu Sa'ld Muhammad b. 'All al-Naqqash al-Isbahanl (d. 414/1023).3 The earliest extant book on forged hadlths is the Tadhkirat al-mawdudt of Muhammad b. Tahir al-MaqdisI (d. 507/ 1113). The first systematic discussion and application of content criticism among hadith scholars did not appear until Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya's (d. 751/1350) al-Mandr al-munlffi al-sahih wa'l-ddif. The critical output of Muslim hadith scholars in the formative 3rd/ 9th and 4th/ 10th centuries was confined to the capacious tomes they devoted to identifying and evaluating hadith transmitters (rijdl) or examining various narrations of hadlths for technical flaws ('ilal) not associated with their meanings. Books of transmitter criticism include the al-Tdrikh al-kablr, the al-Tdrikh al-awsat and the Kitdb al-duafa al-saghir of al-Bukharl, the Kitdb al-duafa al-kablr of Abu 2) Noha El-Hennawy, "In Word and Deed: Reformist Thinker Gamal El-Banna Re-ignites an Age-old Debate: Contesting the Role of Sunnah in Modern-day Islam"; http://www. egypttoday.com/article.aspx?Articleid=3351 (last accessed 8/14/06). 3) This work is mentioned by al-Dhahabi in his Mizdn al-i tiddly Shams al-DIn Muhammad al-Dhahabl (d. 748/1348), Mizdn al-i tidal fi naqd al-rijal, ed.

Shuayb al-Nasal (d. 303/915-16), Ibn Manda (d. 395/1004-5) and al-Hakim al-Naysaburl (d. 405/1014) did sometimes consciously focus on the forgery {wad) of hadlths, but this was done through brief lists of transmitters known to be prominent forgers.5 It was the inimitable Ignaz Goldziher who first deduced from this evidence that Muslim scholars investigated reports only "in respect of their outward form[,] and judgment of the value of the contents depends on the judgment of the correctness of the isndd? Even if the text of a hadlth is replete with suspicious material, "Nobody is allowed to say: 'because the matn contains a logical contradiction or historical absurdity I doubt the correctness of the isndd.'" From this Goldziher concludes that "Muslim critics have no feeling for even the crudest anachronisms provided that the isndd is correct/' He intimates that the Muslim religious worldview fosters such critical charity, for the Prophet's divinely granted knowledge of the future explains any anachronisms in his hadlths.6 4) In his study of the Tdrikh al-kabir, Christopher Melchert suggests that the work is not generally concerned with the evaluation of the transmitters it details; a relatively small percentage of entries actually include a rating of the subject. Here I do treat the Tdrikh al-kabir as a work of transmitter criticism because a) it does include evaluations even if they occur in the minority of entries, b) al-Bukhari s evaluations of hadlths in an entry reflect on the reliability of the transmitter and c) later books of transmitter criticism like the Kitdb al-duafa al-kabir (The Great Book of Weak Transmitters) of Abu Jafar al-'Uqayll (d. 323/934) treat al-Bukharl's al-Tdrikh al-kabir as a major source.

"Hadith," he states, "was not criticized from the point of view of what was inherently reasonable and to be regarded as worthy of credence, but from a consideration of the reputation which the guarantors of the tradition bore."7 "On the other hand," he adds, "if the subject- matter (matn) contained an obvious absurdity or an anachronism there was no ground for rejecting the hadith if the isnddwzs sound."8 Later scholars such as AJ. Wensinck, Joseph Schacht, James Robson, von Grunebaum, Fazlur Rahman, G.H.A. Juynboll, RE. Peters, and Ron Buckley have upheld these conclusions.9 Even those Western scholars who do note that Muslim hadith critics heeded the meaning of a hadith when examining its authenticity include only vague allusions to this sensitivity to content.10 When Western scholars have pursued their discussion of content criticism further, their evidence is either of questionable reliability or concerns sources much later than the formative period of hadith criticism from the 2nd/8th to the 4th/ 10th centuries. published in 1889-90.

There are indeed famous reports of the Prophet's wife 'A'isha rejecting Ibn 'Umar's statement that the Prophet warned mourners that a dead relative would be punished for his family's excessive mourning over him because she believed that it violated the Qur'anic principle that 'no bearer of burdens bears the burdens of another {Id taziru wdziraf" wizra ukhrd) (Qur'an 53:38). &gt;12 In another famous report, 'A'isha upbraids a Companion who said that the Prophet told the Muslims that their prayer is invalidated if a woman, a black dog or a donkey passes in front of them. "You have compared us to donkeys and dogs!" she retorts. "By God I saw the Prophet (s) praying with me lying on the bed between him and the direction of prayer...!"13 Ibn 'Abbas reportedly objected to Abu Hurayra reporting that the Prophet had said that Muslims must perform ablutions after eating food cooked by fire. Ibn 'Abbas objects, "O Abu Hurayra, are we to perform ablutions from [consuming] oil or heated water!?"14 1 1 ] Nabia Abbott, Studies in Arabic Literary Papyri II: Quranic Commentary and Tradition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), 75.

Almost all stories about content criticism in the first two generations of the Muslim community come from the mainstay Sunni hadith collections compiled in the mid 3rd/9th century. Earlier material, such as several of the above-mentioned criticisms by 'A'isha, first appears in the late 2nd/8th-century works of al-Shafi'l (d. 204/820). 15 This still does not provide us with an historically reliable picture of content criticism in the fraught era of the Companions. Unfortunately, in terms of its attestation, evidence of content criticism before the generation of critics like al-Bukharl is contemporaneous with them. Furthermore, stories about 'A'isha rejecting a report attributed to the Prophet due to its objectionable contents do not shed any light on whether or not formative hadith critics like Ibn Hanbal (d. 241/855) or al-Bukharl followed suit. These rare reports featuring content criticism by Companions are scattered in the various topical chapters of hadith collections; they are absent in early efforts to outline the hadith scholars' critical methodology, such as Muslim's (d. 261/875) introduction to his Sahih or al- Tirmidhl's (d. 279/892) Kitdb al-ilal. While Abbott drew on material that ostensibly predated the development of hadith criticism, other scholars affirming the practice of content criticism in the hadith tradition have relied on evidence that post-dates the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries. John Burton states that "criticism of the matn was not so rare as is sometimes claimed," but the one example he provides comes from the work judicial rulings of 'All because Abu Mashar repeatedly brought him rulings that he knew differed from 'All s established decisions on issues such as the fate of a slave women who bears her master a child; Abu Sulayman Hamd al-Khattabl (d. 388/998), Mddlim al-sunan, 3rd ed., 4 vols.

His footnotes, however, reveal that he relied on a work published in 1 960 by Mustafa al-Sibai, which lists fifteen signs of forgery in the contents of a hadlth.17 When we trace the source of these tell-tale signs, however, we find them most exhaustively developed by the early Ottoman-period scholar 'All b. Muhammad Ibn 'Arraq (d. 963/1556) in his work on forged hadlths, Tanzih al-sharia al-marfua 'an al-akhbdr al-shania al-mawdua, and the Mamluk-period scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya in his book al-Mandr al-munif}* These authors in turn derived this list from the earliest Sunni hadlth scholar to introduce the notion of formal criteria for uncovering a forged hadlth by reference to its contents, the 5th/ 11th-century hadlth master al-Khatib al-Baghdadl (d. 463/ 1071). In his monumental treatise on the science of hadlth collection and criticism, al-Kifdya fi Him usul al-riwdya, al-Khatib begins his discussion of forged hadlths with the classical rationalist division of reports: (1) reports whose truth is known immediately (mutawdtir), (2) reports whose falsity is known immediately and (3) reports whose authenticity can be known only after study (the bulk of the hadlth corpus). Hadlths that are immediately evident as false are identified by one of the following indications: first, they contradict reason (al-uqut)&gt; for example, the statement that no Creator exists. Second, the hadlth contradicts the Qur'an, a widely established precedent of the Prophet {al-sunna al-mutawdtira) or a report that the Muslim 16) John Burton, An Introduction to the Hadith (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1994), 169. 17) Daniel W.

Third, the report conveys information that is so essential for Muslims that God would not allow it to be reported by a means other than one that assured its certainty. Finally, a report about some evident, unmis- takable event that, if it had occurred, would have necessarily been described via widely transmitted reports.19 The first two criteria identify hadiths that contradict sources that the Mu'tazilite and Ash'arl schools considered epistemologically certain, namely the precepts of reason, the Qur'an, established sunna and the consensus of the Muslim community.20 The third and fourth identify hadiths that violate principles that Sunni legal theorists also considered epistemologically compelling: Gods rules (al-dda) for how a Prophet's message and human society in general function. This formalized epistemological ranking would have seemed very foreign to Ibn Hanbal or al-Bukhari, who shunned rationalist discourse and whose methods of hadlth criticism never resembled it. Not surprisingly, al-Khatib's criteria were originally developed by 19) Al-Khatlb al-Baghdadi, al-Kifdyafi marifat usul 'ilm al-riwdya, ed. Abu Ishaq Ibrahim Mustafa al-Dimyatl, 2 vols.

Aban (d. 221/836). In a work rebutting the controversial Muslim rationalist Bishr al-Marls! (d. 218/833) as well as al-Shafi'l, Ibn Aban elaborated the three-fold division of reports and stated that the early Muslim community (salafi rejected dhdd (non-widely transmitted) reports that either contradict the Qur'an or established sunna (sunna thdbitd), or describe an event that would have been more widely reported had it really occurred. He also makes the ultimate arbiter for judging the veracity of a report the verdict of reason {ijtihdd), not the isndd?1 Although he seems to have been largely unknown to early hadlth critics, 'Isa b. Aban was a member of the Hanafi tradition that was anathema to ahl alsunna hadlth scholars, had written a rebuttal of al-Shafi'l and upheld that bete noire of the ahl al-hadith: a belief that the Qur'an was created.23 Al-Khatib may have found al- 21) Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalanl, al-Nukat 'aid kitdb Ibn al-Saldh, ed.

Moreover, al-Khatib's list of content criticism principles seems out of place even in his own work. Not once does he apply them openly in his Kifdya. Nor have I found him reject a hadlth based on the criteria he lays out in the Kifdya in his analyses of the numerous hadlths he identifies as forged in his Tdrikh Baghdad.24 Modern Muslim scholars have faced the same challenges as their Western counterparts. Their arguments rely either on the historically problematic content criticism of Companions like 'A'isha or the list of criteria derived from al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl. In his A Textbook of Hadlth Studies^ Mohammad Hashim Kamali's discussion of the criteria that hadlth critics employed consists of a summary of the content- based criteria elaborated by Ibn al-Qayyim and later Sunni scholars.25 (biography of Ibn Aban); al-Dhahabl, Mizdn al-i tidal, 3:310; ibid, Siyaraldm al-nubald\ vol. 10, ed.

'Abd al-Fattah Muhammad al-Hulw, 2nd ed., 5 vols. (Giza: Hujr, 1413/1993), 2:678- 80. 24) For example, al-Khatlb cites no content problem with the hadlth in which the Prophet says, "I am the city of knowledge and 'All is its gate," merely calling it "a lie"; al-Khatlb, Tdrikh Baghdad, 1 1:201. For other instances of al-Khatlb identifying forged hadlths, see ibid., 8:56, 8:162 ("mawdu al-matn wal-isndcT), 9:47, 9:440, 9:456, 10:356, 11:241. In his identification of forgeries, al-Khatlb does occasionally use the death dates of transmitters to prove that they could not have heard a hadlth from the source they claim. See, for example, ibid., 3:59; cf. Ahmad b. Aybak Ibn al-Dimyatl, al-Mustafdd min Dhayl Tdrikh Baghdad, ed. Mustafa 'Abd al-Qadir 'Ata (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1417/1997), 21:41-2. Interestingly, al-Khatlb does apply the criterion that a report could not be true if it describes an event that would have been more widely noticed to a non-Prophetic historical report: when the famous grammarians al-Kisa'i and Slbawayh sought the opinion of a group of the Caliphs Bedouin guards to settle a debate, al-Khatlb recounts that some accused al-Kisal of conspiring with the Bedouins so that they would provide the verdict he wanted. Al-Khatlb, however, notes, "This opinion is untenable, since something like this would not remain hidden from the Caliph, the vizier or the people of Baghdad"; al- Khatlb, Tdrikh Baghdad, 12:104 (biography of 'All b. al-Mubarak al-Nahwl). 25) Mohammad Hashim Kamali, A Textbook ofHadith Studies (Markfield, U.K. : The Islamic Foundation, 2005), 194-7.

Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 In a work devoted to rebutting Orientalist accusations that Muslim scholars ignored content criticism, Muhammad Luqman al-Salafi invokes the well-worn examples of Companions like 'A'isha.26 He also presents his own list of criteria for content criticism, largely drawn from the works of Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn 'Arraq. As examples, however, he draws on hadiths criticized by the 8th/ 14th-century scholar Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1 328). 27 Ultimately, he can trace this approach back no further than al-Khatibs al-Kifdya.28 Remarkably, Luqman al-Salafl and the Indian Hamza al-Mallbari have been the only modern Muslim scholars to provide any evidence for content criticism from the early hadith tradition, and we will note their contribution presently.29 Evidence of Content Criticism by Hadith Scholars in the 3rd/9th Century The following are examples of content criticism from 3rd/9th-century works of transmitter criticism. 1.

Nubata (fl. mid 2nd/8th century) in the Kitdb al-duafa al-saghir, al-Bukhari notes that Hashraj narrated the hadith "the Prophet (s) said to Abu Bakr, 'Umar and cUth- man, 'These are the caliphs after me/" Al-Bukhari adds that this hadith is "not corroborated {Id yutdbau 'alayhi) because 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'All b.

'Umara al-Qaysi (d. 212/827-28), al-Bukharl notes that some of his hadlths are accepted and some rejected (yurafu wayunkarti). As an example of his poor transmissions, al-Bukhari notes that 'Awn transmitted the hadlth "The signs [of the Day of Judg- ment] are after the year 200 AH (al-dydt ba d al-mi atayn) ." Al-Bukhari rejects the hadlth because "these two hundred [years] have passed, and there have been none of these signs."31 This criticism is not present in al-Bukharl's surviving works on transmitter criticism, but al-Dhahabi (d. 748/1348) cites it from a lost work, probably al-Bukharis Kitdb al- duafa al-kabir (Great Book of Weak Transmitters).32 We can corroborate that al-Bukhari did in fact level this criticism at the hadlth because the early 4th/ 10th-century critic al-'Uqayll notes that al-Bukhari rejected it.33 Interestingly, this hadlth was included in Ibn Majah's (d. 273/887) Sunan and declared authentic by al-Hakim al-Naysaburl in his al-Mus- tadrak 'aid al-Sahihayn?4 Zayid (Beirut: Dar al-Marifa, 1406/1986), 42.

Hani Abu al-Za'ra' (fl. late lst/7th century) in the Tdrikh al-kabir, al-Bukhari says that 'Abdallah had quoted Ibn Mas'ud that on the Day of Judgment the Prophet will follow Gabriel, Abraham, Jesus (or Moses according to another transmission) as the fourth figure to come forward and intercede with God on behalf of the Muslims. Al-Bukhari dismisses this hadlth, since "it is known that the Prophet said, T am the first intercessor (and awwal shaft) [on the Day of Judgment]. 'Abdallah b. Hani's hadlth is not corroborated."35 - In his al- Tdrikh al-awsat (sometimes referred to as his al- Tdrikh al-saghir) , al-Bukhari provides a critical entry on the transmitter Abu Bahr Muhammad b. Fada' (fl. mid 2nd/8th century). Al-Bukhari notes that Sulayman b. Harb (d. 224/238-39) had accused Abu Bahr of selling alcohol and of narrating the hadlth "The Prophet (s) forbade breaking apart Muslim coins in circulation (nahd al-nabl (s) 'an kasr sikkat al- muslimln al-jdriya baynahum)." Al-Bukhari also quotes Sulayman as saying "but [it was] al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf [who] minted coins, they did not exist at the time of the Prophet (s)." This hadlth appears in the Musannaf of Ibn Abl Shayba (d. 235/849), the Sunans of Abu Dawud (d. 275/889), Ibn Majah and other later texts.36 al-Zamrill and Muhammad al-Mu'tasim bi'llah al-Baghdadl, 5 vols.

There are many well-known hadlths stating that the Prophet is the first intercessor, including one through Anas b. Malik 4r the Prophet: I am the first person to intercede in Paradise, and I am the prophet with the most followers (and awwal al-nds yashfau ft al-janna wa and akthar al-anbiya tabaan); Sahih Muslim: kitdb al-imdn^ bdb qawlal-nabi and awwal al-nds yashfa 'u ft al-janna wa and akthar al-anbiya tabaan; cf.

Al-Bukhari's sensitivity to this issue is understandable in his context, since both versions of this hadlth in al-Tirmidhis Jdmt (through Ibn cAbbas) and Ibn Majahs Sunan mention the Prophet's first place in intercession to stress his superiority or at least parity with Moses, Abraham and Jesus; Jdmt al-Tirmidhi: kitdb al-mandqib, bdb ft fadl al-nabi (s); Sunan Ibn Mdjah: kitdb al-zuhd, bdb dhikr al-shafaa. 36) Al-Bukhari, al- Tdrikh al-awsat, ed.

Ibn Hibban notes that what few hadlths Abu Bahr transmitted were munkar^ including the hadlth in question (without the explicit content criticism). He adds that both Ibn Hanbal and Ibn Main considered him weak; Ibn Hibban, al-Majruhin, 2:27 A. Ibn cAdl lists four narrations of this hadlth all through the same basic isndd and, again, no content criticism.

Yuhannas (fl. late lst/7th century) that he trans- mitted one narration of a hadlth disseminated by Hukayma bt. Umayya, from Umm Salama, from the Prophet: "Whoever undertakes the greater or lesser pilgrimage to the Haram Mosque [in Mecca] beginning at the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem], all his previous sins will be forgiven (man ah alia bi-hijja wa lumra min al-masjid al-aqsd ild al-masjid al-hardm ghufira lahu md taqaddama min dhanbihi)? Al-Bukharl notes that "this hadlth is not corroborated due to the Prophet (s) setting [the two places] Dhu al-Hulayfa and al-Juhfa as the stations for beginning the pilgrimage and that he chose to enter the state of pilgrimage (ahalla) at Dhu al- Hulayfa." Here it is interesting to note that, although al-Bukharl rejects the hadlth, he offers no criticism of the narrator. This hadlth appears in the Sunans of Ibn Majah and Abu Dawud, as well as the Musnadof Ibn Hanbal and the Sunan al-kubrd of al-Bayhaqi (d. 458/1066).37 - Although Abu Dawud, al-Nasa I, al-Tirmidhi (d. 279/892) and Ibn Majah all narrated from Salih b.

'Abdallah b. 'Umar, from Ibn 'Umar, from cUmar, from the Prophet: "Whoever has been greedy [in unfairly hoarding spoils of war], burn his booty (man ghalla fahriqu mataahu)?

From the Kitab al-tamyiz of Muslim b. al-Hajjaj al-Naysdburi (d. 261/875): The Kitdb al-tamyiz of Muslim b. al-Hajjaj has survived only in part; the full work appears to have been a much larger book that is unique in the history of hadith criticism. Addressed to a junior scholar seeking to understand the justifications for and workings of the science of hadith criticism, the book lays out Muslim's critical methodology with a text-book clarity matched only by the author s lucid introduction to his Sahih. The transparency of Muslim's critical method as presented in the Kitdb al-tamyiz explains why this is the only source from which modern Muslim apologists like al-Mallbari and Luqman al-Salafl have been able to muster examples of early content criticism.41 The Kitdb al-tamyiz, in fact, contains no less than nineteen instances of explicit content criticism. The following is a representative sample: - Muslim criticizes one version of a hadith narrated by the famous Basran transmitter Shu'ba b. al-Hajjaj (d. 160/776) because its isndd lacks an important link found in other versions and because the report states that the Prophet said Amen (amiri)' silently in his prayers. Muslim states that "narrations have been widely reported (tawdtarat al-riwdydt) that the Prophet said Amen' out loud."42 - Muslim criticizes one version of a hadith in which the young Ibn 'Abbas joins the Prophet while the latter is praying, and the Prophet moves Ibn 39) Al-Bukhari, al- Tdrikh al-kabir, 4:24 1 . 40) Sunan al-Ddrimi\ kitdb al-siyar, bdbft uqiibat al-ghdll; Sunan Abi Dawud. kitdb al- jihddy bdbfi uqubat al-ghdll; Jdmi al-Tirmidhi: kitdb al-hudud, bdb ma jd a ft al-ghdll md yusnau bihi. 41) Al-Mallbari, Nazardt jadiday 89 ff., 129-32; Luqman al-Salafl, Ihtimdm al-muhaddithin, 330 ff. 42) Muslim b. al-Hajjaj al-Naysaburi, Kitdb al-tamyiz^ ed.

Muslim states, "It is the sunna of the Messenger of God (s) in the rest of the reports from Ibn 'Abbas that a person praying with an imam stands to his right, not his left."43 - Concerning a series of hadlths describing the significance of Chapter 112 of the Qur'an (suratal-ikhlds), Muslim states that "the generality of the upright [transmitters] have reported from the Prophet that it is the equivalent of one third of the Qur'an." A report by one Ibn Wardan to the effect that it equals one fourth is thus a minority report. In addition, Muslim continues, Ibn Wardan mentions four other chapters of the Qur'an that are the equivalent of one-fourth of the holy book - a total of five-fourths. This logical contradiction is, in Muslim's words, "repre- hensible (mustankar), and it is not conceivable that its meaning is correct {ghayr mafhum sihhat mandhu)"44 3. From the Kitab al-ma'rifa wal-tarikh of Abu YusufYaqub b. Sufydn al-Fasawi (d. 277/890-91): - In his work on the historical development of the Muslim community and its main transmitters of religious knowledge, the Kitdb al-mdrifa wal-tdrikh, al-Fasawi includes a section on the transmitter Zayd b. Wahb (d. 96/714-15) in which he notes several problematic reports transmitted by Zayd. In one, 'Umar b. al-Khattab asks Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman, to whom the Prophet had confided the names of the hypocrites {mundfiqun), if the Prophet had mentioned the gruff second caliph as one of them. Hudhayfa replies, "No [he did not], and I will not inform anyone after you." Al-Fasawi objects that "this is impossible (mubdl), and I fear that it is forged (kadhib)." He adds that 'Umar is one of the veterans of the the Battle of Badr, who the Qur'an announced had all attained salvation, and the Prophet had also said that if there were to be another prophet after him it would be 'Umar.45 43) Ibid., 137. 44&gt; Ibid., 147. 45) Abu Yusuf Ya'qub b.

Damra (d. 144/ 761-62) in which Ibn cUmar states that the Prophet used to perform sixteen superogatory prayer cycles a day. Al-Juzajanl retorts: O slaves of God, is it befitting for any of the Companions of the Prophet (s) or his wives to report this [number of] prayer cycles?! For they were with [the Prophet] during their time, and the report from 'A'isha (r) is twelve optional prayer cycles, and Ibn 'Umar mentioned ten. And the generality of the umma, or whomever you wish [to cite] , have accepted ('arafu) that the number of optional (sunna) prayer cycles is twelve. . . . And if someone objects, "How many hadlths have been narrated by only one person [and been accepted]?", say, "you are correct, indeed the Prophet (s) would sit and speak a word of wisdom that he might never repeat, and only one man would mem- orize it from him.... But, according to 'Asim, [the Prophet] would repeat these [sixteen] prayer cycles regularly, so this could not have been confused.46 - In the entry on Salm b. Salim al-Balkhi (d. 196/812), al-Juzajanl notes that when Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 181/797) was asked about the hadlth on how lentils were sacralized {quddisd) on the tongues of seventy prophets, he replied, "No, not even on the tongue of one prophet!

From the Sahih of Muhammad b. Ishaq Ibn Khuzayma (d. 311/923): - Although only a portion of the book has survived, there is strong evidence that the famous Shafi'i scholar of Naysabur, Ibn Khuzayma, conducted content criticism in his Sahih collection. The 8th/ 14th-century scholar Badr al-Dln al-Zarkashi (d. 794/1392) quotes Ibn Khuzaymas criticism of the hadlth, "Indeed, one of God s slaves should not lead a group in prayer and pray to God for himself exclusively - for if he does this, he has betrayed [the group] {Id yaummanna 'abet1" qawman fa-yakhussu nafsahu bi-dawafa-infaalafa-qadkhdnahum)? Ibn Khuzayma objects that, while leading a group in prayer, the Prophet had once made the invocation: "O God, distance me from my wrongs (Alldhumma baid baynl wa bayna khatdydy)"48 If the Prophet limited an invocation to himself alone, it is clearly not a treacherously selfish act. An allusion to this content criticism can be found in the surviving portions of the Sahih, where Ibn Khuzayma includes a subchapter on how the imam can say a prayer specifically for himself, "contrary to the unestablished report attributed to the Prophet that [the imam] has betrayed them [in doing that]."49 2. From the Works of Ibn Hibbdn al-Busti (d 354/965): - We also find an instance of content criticism in the sahih collection of the 4th/ 10th-century hadlth critic Ibn Hibban. Here, the author cate- gorically rejects all hadlths that describe how the Prophet would bind a rock tightly against his stomach with a cloth to ward off the pangs of hunger while fasting. In one report, the Prophet instructs Muslims not to follow his example in fasting parts of the months before and after 48) Badr al-Dln Abu 'Abdallah Muhammad b.

Ibn Hibban explains that any report in which the Prophet is forced to extreme measures by hunger would entail that God had let His prophet go hungry - a notion that contradicts the hadlth. Moreover, Ibn Hibban adds that the correct wording of the rock-tying reports is not 'rock {hajar), but rather 'hajazy or the end of the loincloth (izdr). He adds, "And a rock does not ward off hunger."50 - Ibn Hibban's compendium of unreliable hadlth transmitters, the Kitdb al-majruhin min al-muhaddithin al-duafa wal-matrukin, contains an entry on Aban b. Sufyan al-MaqdisI (fl. early 3rd/9th century) in which the author notes that Aban narrated two forged reports. One states that '"Abdallah b. 'Abdallah b. Ubayy's incisor was damaged in the Battle of Uhud, so the Messenger of God (s) ordered him to make an incisor out of gold {annahu uslbat thaniyyatuhu yawm Uhudfa-amarahu Rasul Allah (s) an yattakhidha thaniyyaf" min dhahab)." Aban also reported a hadlth in which 'the Messenger of God (s) forbade us to pray towards someone sleeping or in a state of ritual impurity (nahd rasul Allah (s) an nusalliya ild naim aw mutahaddith) ." Ibn Hibban objects that "those two [reports] are forged, for how could the Prophet (s) order making an incisor made of gold when he had said, 'Indeed gold and silk are forbidden for the males of my umma.'" He continues, "And how could he forbid praying in the direction of someone who is asleep when he used to pray with 'A'isha lying between him and the qibld?"51 Why is Content Criticism so Hard to Find? In the preceding section, I adduced fifteen examples of explicit content criticism from the formative 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries of the Sunni hadlth tradition. Although such examples are very rare, they do establish the existence of content criticism in the early period. They prove that al-Bukharl, Muslim, al-Juzajanl, al-Fasawi, Ibn Khuzayma and Ibn Hibban possessed the critical imagination 50) Ibn Hibban al-Busti and cAla al-Dln 'All al-Farisi (d.739/ 1 338-39) , al-Ihsan bi-tartib Sahih Ibn Hibban, ed.

Among them, we find a clear awareness of historical anachronism, a sensitivity to logical impossibility and, most prominently, a clear vision of the historical, legal and dogmatic baselines against which individual reports should be judged. Al- Bukharl 'knew' that the Prophet had not appointed a successor, that he would be the first intercessor for the Muslims on the Day of Judgment, and that he had established fixed points for the beginning of the pilgrimage. Al-Bukhari also reacted skeptically to a report in which the Prophet supposedly predicted events which, if the report were true, would have already materialized. Muslim used the historical 'reality' established when hadiths had "been widely transmitted {fa- wdtarai)" or by "the manifest prevalence (tazdhur) of authentic reports from the Messenger of God (s)" to identify and isolate contradictory minority reports transmitted through only one or two narrations.52 We can perceive the limits of al-Fasawfs 'thinkable thought' in his refusal to accept that 'Umar could entertain the possibility of being a hypocrite. Al-Juzajani quotes Ibn al-Mubarak plainly rejecting a hadlth because it contradicts sense perception and his experience. Content criticism would seem to be a fundamental component in transmitter evaluation - a purveyor of hadiths with unacceptable meanings could be deemed unreliable on the basis of what he transmitted. Ibn 'Adi often states that the questionable hadiths that a certain transmitter narrates "demonstrate that he is unreliable."53 When asked by a student why he considered the transmitter 'Abbas b. al-Fadl al-Ansarl (d. 186/802) to be unreliable, Ibn Main (d. 233/848) replied, "Because he narrates from Sa id, from Qatada, from Jabir b. Zayd, from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (s) said, 'When it is the year such-and-such, such-and-such will happen,' and that is a hadlth with no basis (^/).'"54 If these prominent Sunni hadlth scholars were able and willing to employ content criticism, why do they seem to have utilized it 52) Muslim, Kitdb al-tamyiz, 134, 136. 53&gt; Ibn 'Adi, al-KdmiU 2:587, see also ibid., 3:1239. 54) Ibn Abl Hatim, al-Jarh wal-tadil (Hyderabad: Dar'irat al-Ma'arif al-'Uthmaniyya, 1360/[194l]), 6:212-13; Ibn Qudama, al-Muntakhab min al-Ilal 300.</page><page sequence="22">1 64 J.A.

If content criticism constituted part of these scholars' critical apparatus, why is it so hard to find in surviving texts of transmitter criticism? To answer this question we must turn to the intellectual milieu of the Islamic Near East in the formative period of Sunni hadlth criticism. Die Ahl al-hadith and Muslim Rationalists Few features of Islamic intellectual history are as well known as the conflict between the school of thought that espoused a reliance on material transmitted from the early Muslim community to elaborate Islamic law and dogma (the self-proclaimed ahl al-hadith) and those who either favored a more selective use of hadlth combined with a reliance on independent legal reasoning (called the ahl al-ray by the ahl al-hadith and generally associated with the Hanafi tradition) or those who leaned towards the Hellenistic rationalist tradition (dubbed the ahl al-kaldm, including the Mu'tazilites and other rationalists such as the Jahmiyya).55 Here we will not attempt a taxonomy of these different schools in the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries, as we are only concerned with the ahl al-hadith' s perception of their adversaries. It is enough to say that these schools of thought had fundamentally different approaches to elaborating Islamic law and dogma, but that their rhetoric and stances were sharpened and exacerbated by their con- stant, vicious sparring with one another. For their opponents, the ahl al-hadith were brainless literalists, clinging absurdly to transmitted 55) Goldziher, Muslim Studies, 2:78 ff.; J.

To the ahl al-hadith&gt; the ahl al-ray and ahl al-kalam were arrogant heretics who abandoned the documented precedent of the Prophet for the musings of their own frail minds. Each group created a cult of methodology; the ahl al- kaldm glorified the ability of reason to determine the proper inter- pretations of the sources of revelation, and the ahl al-hadith sacralized the isndd as the only means to guarantee a pure understanding of the Prophet's Islam and rise above the heresies of the human mind. Here we will concern ourselves only with the role of the isndd and content criticism in this conflict. As Josef van Ess has shown, Mutazilites such as cAmr b. 'Ubayd (d. 144/761) accepted hadiths as a source of Islamic law and dogma but insisted on content criticism as the only suitable means to judge their authenticity.56 The Mu'tazilite master al-Nazzam (d. ca. 220- 30/835-45) thus gave no credit to the number of narrations or attestations of a hadith; only an examination of the meaning of a report could affirm its authenticity, and "the means of rational proof (jihat hujjat 'aqt) could abrogate {tansakhu) transmitted reports."57 For the Mu'tazilites and other rationalist groups such as the Jahmiyya, the Qur'an and human reason were the chief tools for content criticism. As the literal words of God, the legal and dogmatic principles laid out in the Qur'an provided the ideal criteria for determining the contours of the faith and its community. The rationalists' chief justification for the use of the Qur'an as a criterion in their debates with the ahl al-hadith was a report in which the Prophet states, "When a hadith comes to you from me, compare it to the Book of God, and if it agrees with it then accept it, and if it differs with it, leave it (idhd jaakum al-hadith fariduhu 'aid kitdb Allah wa in wdfaqahu fa-khudhuhu wa in khdlafahu fa- 56) Josef van Ess, "L'Autorite de la tradition prophetique dans la theologie mu'tazilite," in La Notion d'autorite au Moyen Age: Islam, Byzance, Occident, ed.

Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 dauhu)"58 In his 'Epistle on the Rebuttal of Anthropomorphism' {Risdlafi nafy al-tashbih), al-Jahiz (d. 255/868-69) announces that using the Quran to test the validity of hadiths dealing with issues such as God's attributes is an essential part of his school. Mocking ahl al-hadith apologists like Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) for attempting to find acceptable interpretations for hadiths that rationalists considered problematic, al-Jahiz concludes that such efforts to evade the Quranic litmus test would invalidate the Prophet's statement that "lies will spread after me, so whatever hadlth comes to you compare it with the Book of God."59 The second principal criterion employed by Muslim rationalists like al-Jahiz to determine the authenticity of hadiths was reason. Al-Jahiz explains: If not for rational discussion (kaldm), religions would never be upheld for God, and we would never have been able to distinguish ourselves from the atheists (mulhidin) , and there would be no distinction between truth and falsehood, nor a separation between a true prophet and a pretender. Real proof {hujja) would never have stood out from specious argument (al-hila), strong indication from ambiguity.60 Even when Mutazilites such as Abu al-Qasim al-Ka'bl al-Balkhl (d. 319/931) began in-depth studies of hadlth in order to combat their ahl al-hadith opponents on their own terms, content criticism and the role of reason remained central to the Mu'tazilite school. In his work on hadlth criticism, the Qubul al-akhbdr, al-Balkhl explains that the requirements for a good hadlth are that it accord with the Qur'an, with the sunna that has been agreed upon by the umma or the early Muslim community, and finally with "the principles of God's justice ( (adl) and Unicity (tawhid)y which cannot be challenged or changed by anyone." In this final case, he recognizes that hadiths 58) For extended versions of this hadlth, see al-Tabaranl, al-Mujam al-kabir, 12:233; al- Bayhaqi, Ma rifat al-sunan wa'l-dthdr&gt; ed. cAbd al-Mu'ti Amln QaTajI (Cairo: Dar al-Wa'i, 1412/1991), 1:117-8. 59) Al-Jahiz, Rasa il al-jdhizy ed.

Ibn Qutayba describes how the ahl al-kaldm would mock the ahl al-hadith for heaping accolades on one another for their knowledge of the different narrations (turuq) of hadiths without understanding their basic meaning or even their grammar. The ahl al-kaldms mantra was, he said, "The stupider the muhaddith, the more prominent and trusted he is among them."62 In a story that appears in a much later Mu'tazilite source, the Tabaqdt al-mutazila of Ibn al-Murtada (d. 839/1437), the scion of the school, Abu cAll al-Jubbal (d. 303/915- 16), is asked to evaluate two hadiths narrated through the same isndd, Al-Jubba'l authenticates the first hadith, which prohibits women from marrying their aunts' husbands {Id tankihu al-mara 'aid 'ammatihd wa Id 'aid khdlatiha). But he rejects as false the second hadith, in which Adam bests Moses in an argument over pre- destination by telling him that no one has the right to blame Adam or Eve for their expulsion from Paradise, since God had willed this act of disobedience (this hadith contradicts the Mu'tazilite belief in free will). When his interlocutor asks him, "Two hadiths with the same isndd, you authenticate one and reject the other?", al-Jubba'l replies that the second one could not be the words of the Prophet because "the Qur'an demonstrates its falsity, as does the consensus of the Muslims and the evidence of reason."63 In his Td wil mukhtalif al-hadith, Ibn Qutayba thus finds himself rebutting four general criticisms of hadith by rationalists: 1 a hadith contradicts the Qur'an. 2 it contradicts other, established hadiths. 61) Abu al-Qasim al-Balkhl al-Kabl, Qubul al-akhbdr wa marifat al-rijaU ed.

Abu Nu'aym al-Isbahanl (d. 430/1038) narrates a report in which the Mu'tazilite £Amr b. cUbayd was presented with a hadith whose meaning he found unacceptable. 'Amr rejects each step in the isndd: If I heard al-A'mash say that [report], I would disbelieve him. If I heard Zayd b. Wahb say that, I would not reply. And if I heard Abdallah b. Mas'ud say that, I would not accept it. And even if I heard the Messenger of God (s) say that, I would reject it. If I heard God [Himself] most high say it, I would say to Him: this was not part of the covenant You made with us (laysa 'aid hddhd akhadhta mithdqana) .65 In another polemic against 'Amr b. 'Ubayd, al-Daraqutnl reports that the Mutazilite had heard the hadith of Bahz b. Hakim that "a man ordered his family, if he died, to burn him and then scatter his ashes on a windy day" so that God could never find him to exact retribution on him for his sins.

Unlike the ahl al-kaldm, whom they saw as arrogantly glorifying the capacity of human reason, or the ahl al-rdy, whom they viewed as rejecting or accepting hadlths arbitrarily when it suited their legal opinion,67 the ahl al-hadith perceived themselves as "cultivating the ways of the Messenger, fending off [heretical innovation and lies] from revealed knowledge (al-ilm)."68 To question the rational acceptability of a report was to allow the human mind too much free rein in defining religion; if a report could be traced to the Prophet, Muslims should hear and obey. Because it clashed with the ahl al-hadith position that hadlths could abrogate or modify Qur'anic rulings, the Mu'tazilite hadlth instructing Muslims to compare reports attributed to the Prophet with the Quran was uniformly rejected as inauthentic by Sunni hadlth scholars.69 In the Sunan of al-Nasa I (d. 303/915-16), we find the 67) Ibn Qutayba, Tdwil mukhtalifal-hadith, 51-7. 68) This attributed to 'All b. al-Madini (d. 234/849); Ibn 'Adi, al-KdmiU 1:131. 69) These scholars include 'Abd al-Rahman b.

He carries on his back a bundle of wood when there may be a viper in it that could bite him."76 The cult of the isndd became so intense in the self-portrayal of the ahl al-hadith that it was reported that Ibn Hanbal would not accept the habit of praising God before telling his doctor of any ailments he had without an isndd establishing this practice.77 Corollary: A Flaw in the Main Necessitates a Flaw in the Isndd In the face of rationalist opponents who upheld content criticism based on the criteria of the Qur/an and reason, the ahl al-hadith touted the isndd as the only means by which Muslims could ensure the authenticity of Prophetic reports while avoiding the whims of human reason.

If the isndd is authentic, the hadlth is authentic.78 What would be the consequences of conceding, as al- Jubbal claimed, that even if an isndd is perfect, the message it transmits may be forged? It would no longer be possible to trust the isndd, and the whole cult of authenticity built by the ahl al- hadith on the foundation of the isndd would collapse. As the examples of content criticism demonstrate, however, there were some reports whose meanings were patently unacceptable to ahl al-hadith scholars like al-Bukhari and Muslim. How could the ahl al-hadith reconcile rejecting a hadlth for an unacceptable meaning with their obsession with the isndd?. Simply put, if there can be no problem in the contents of a hadlth with a perfect isndd, then a problem in the contents of the hadlth must mean that there is a problem in the isndd. Although he does not follow his argument to its logical conclusion, Luqman al-Salafi alludes to this while arguing that early hadlth critics did not separate isndd criticism from content criticism. Authenticating the matn of a hadlth was the goal of isndd criticism, he reminds us, adding perceptively that if a critic like al-Bukhari found a problematic matn, he would explain the problem in terms of the isndd.79 Hamza al-Malibarl agrees that when a critic like 'All b. al-Madinl (d. 234/849) declared that an isndd was sahih, it meant that every link in the isndd had accurately and honestly reported from the person before him. "So that estab- lishes that the Prophet (s) said [that hadlth], and it could never be correct that the isndd is authentic and the matn weak (daifi"80 78) Later, many participants in the Sunni tradition would embrace the principle that 'the authenticity of a hadlth does not necessarily follow from the authenticity of its isndd (sihhat al-isndd Id yalzamu minhd sihhat al-hadith) ,' since its matn might be flawed or contradict more reliable sources. Ibn al-Salah (d. 643/1245), however, reminds his readers that any hadlth with these problems would by definition not be sabih, necessarily suffering from some undetected flaw in the isndd. For if a matn is not sabih then it is "impossible (muhdl)" that it have a sabih isndd; 'Imad al-Dln Isma'll b. 'Umar Ibn Kathlr, Ikhtisdr 'Uliim al-hadith, ed.

"For the critics," he states, "the authenticity of a hadith depended on the reliability of its trans- mitters." "[I]f a hadith was unauthentic," he continues, "it was because someone had either distorted or forged it. Therefore, if a hadith was to be rejected, one of its transmitters had to be labeled as unreliable."81 Here Dickinson seems to build on John Burton's insightful but vague comment that a hadith scholar who disapproved of the meaning of a report "might tend more usually" to find a flaw in the isndd81 We should thus not be surprised by the scarcity of explicit content criticism in the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries. Perceiving themselves as locked in a bitter conflict with rationalist opponents who insisted that content criticism was the only means by which hadlths could be authenticated, ahl al-hadith scholars like al-Bukharl could not concede to their opponents that the examination of a hadlth's contents is an independent venue of criticism. Instead, they reduced content criticism to a mere function of criticizing the isndd. A flawed meaning was a symptom of a problem in the isndd, not the disease itself. All but two of the above examples of explicit content criticism thus appear in conjunction with isndd criticisms. Hie Correlation between Early Isndd Criticism and Later Explicit Content Criticism The chief obstacle to any clear understanding of content criticism in the formative period of the Sunni hadith tradition is the ambig- uous language that critics like al-Bukharl and Ibn Hanbal employed to assess reports. Their technical vocabulary seems counterintuitive. Whereas most jargons function to communicate meaning clearly within a circle of experts, that of early hadith critics was so vague that even later Muslim hadith scholars expended tremendous effort 81) Dickinson, The Development of Early Sunnite Hadith Criticism, 85. 82) Burton, An Introduction to the Hadith, 169.</page><page sequence="32">[ 74 ]A.

As Ibn cAbd al-Barr (d. 463/1070) would explain, "how many hadlths are there with a weak isndd but a correct meaning {rubb hadith da if al-isndd sahih al-ma 'nd)?"85 When al-Bukharl 83) The modern Moroccan hadith scholars Ahmad b. al-Siddlq al-Ghumari (d. 1960) and his younger brother 'Abdallah al-Ghumari (d. 1993) thus explain a major misunderstanding within the tradition of hadith scholarship: while later scholars like al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl and Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571/1 176) used the term munkar to mean an extremely unreliable or forged hadith, scholars in the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries used to indicate what any narrator, reliable or unreliable, narrated alone without corroboration. The term therefore did not necessarily indicate that the hadith was inauthentic in the eyes of the critic; Ahmad b. al-Siddlq al-Ghumari, Dar al-daf'an hadith man ' ashiqa fa- ajf ed. Iyad Ahmad al- Ghawj (Cairo: Dar al-Mustafa and Dar al-Imam al-Tirmidhi, 1416/1996), 49-50; 'Abdallah b. al-Siddlq al-Ghumari, Tawjih al-indya li-ta'rif'ilm al-hadith riwdyaf" wa dirdya, ed.

Nur al-Dln 'Itr ([n.p.]: [n.p.], 1398/1978), 1:409. An early definition of munkar comes from Abu Bakr Ahmad al-BardljI (d. 301/914), who defined it as a hadith known through only one narration; Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddimat Ibn al-Saldh, 244. After Ibn al-Salah, the term generally denoted a hadith narrated through only one chain of transmission but one of whose narrators was not reliable enough to establish it as reliable. See al-Dhahabl, Mlzdn al-i tidal, 3:140-1. Ibn 'Adi reveals the flexibility of the term in the early period when he describes the material narrated by Ja'far b. 'Umar al-Ibll as "all munkar in either their isndd ot their matn"\ al- Dhahabl, Mizdn al-itiddU 1:561. Abu Hatim al-RazI calls one narration of the famous hadith 'Deeds are [judged] only by intentions (innamd al-d mdl bil-niyydif munkar even though that Prophetic tradition is generally well established; Ibn Abl Hatim al-RazI, 'Hal al-hadith, 2 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-Marifa, 1405/1985), 1:131. In other circumstances, the term munkar seems to indicate 'forged' or 'baseless.'

C Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 1 75 states that a report narrated by All from the Prophet that "I am the abode of wisdom and 'All is its door" is 'munkar? we cannot know whether al-Bukhari objects to the pro-Shiite meaning of the hadlth or merely to that particular isndd, since the report is also narrated from the Prophet by other Companions.86 On its own, then, the term munkar could signify either isndd or content criticism. Although very frustrating to Western historians and later Muslim scholars alike, this ambiguity dovetails exactly with the efforts of early hadlth critics to conceal content criticism from opponents who sought to legitimize it as the sole means for authenticating hadlths. By utilizing technical terms that made content criticism and isndd criticism indistinguishable from one another, hadlth critics were able to maintain their fa$ade of a total reliance on the isndd and their purported boycott of rational criticism. If we hypothesize that content criticism took place in the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th centuries under the guise of isndd criticism or ambiguous terminology such as 'munkar? one would expect a strong correlation between the hadlths mentioned in early books on trans- mitter criticism and those later listed as forgeries in books of mawdudt when that genre blossomed in the 6th/ 12th century. Furthermore, if we assume some significant degree of continuity in what Sunni hadlth critics considered unacceptable contents, then we should expect that a large portion of the hadlths later criticized explicitly for content reasons were early on criticized for transmission flaws or labeled with such generic criticisms as 'munkar' Anecdotal evidence supports this hypothesis. In his entry on Ayyub b. Khalid al-Ansarl (fl. early 2nd/8th century) in the al-Tdrikh al- kablr, al-Bukhari notes that Ayyub narrated from 'Abdallah b. Rafi\ from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet said, "God created the earth {turbo) on Saturday." Al-Bukhari adds that Abu Hurayra did not hear this hadlth from the Prophet, but rather that it was the words Wizarat 'Umum al-Awqaf wal-Shuun al-Islamiyya, 1402/1982, 1st edition 1387/1967), 1:58. 86) Al-Tirmidhl, ' Ilal al-Tirmidhi al-kabir, ed.

In his entry on Jaban b. 'Abdallah, he states that the hadlth "The child born of illicit sexual relations will not enter Heaven {Id yadkhulu al-janna walad al-zind)" is not authentic because of two breaks in the isndd where the transmitters never met one another.89 He rejects another narration of this hadlth through the Prophets wife Maymuna in his entry on Muhammad b. 'Abdallah b. £Amr (d. 145/762-63), again for isndd reasons.90 This hadlth has other narrations as well, but they were also undermined by al-Bukhari's contemporaries. His teacher All b. al- Madinl dismissed a narration of this hadlth from 'Uthman because two transmitters in its isndd were unknown, while his student al- Nasai reported widespread disagreement over the reliability of another isndd of the hadlth through Abu Hurayra.91 87) Al-Bukhari, al-Tdrikh al-kabir, 1 :383.

In a random sample I made of 100 of the 1119 hadiths in the earliest surviving mawdudt book, the Tadhkirat al-mawditdt of al-Maqdisi (d. 507/1113), 95% of the hadiths appear earlier in Ibn Hibban's al-Majruhin, Ibn 'Adi's al-KdmiU al-'Uqaylls al-Duafa al-kabir, Ibn Abi Hatim's al-Jarh wdl-tddiU his Kitdb al-ilaU the transmitter works of al-Bukharl (al-Tdrikh al-kabir, al-Tdrikh al-awsat or his Kitdb aUduafa al-saghir) or al-Juzajanl's Ahwdl al-rijdl.m The central role played by earlier books on weak transmitters in al-Maqdisl's method of identifying forged hadiths is further evident in another, much larger book he composed: the Dhakhirat al-huffdz al-mukharraj 'aid huruf al-alfdz, in which the author lists all the hadiths that Ibn £Adl had included in his Kdmil along with his isndd criticisms. Al-Maqdisi notes that Ibn 'Adi had listed these hadiths "as proof of the weakness of the transmitter addressed."102 In the second earliest book of mawdudt to have survived, the Kitdb al-abdtil wdl-mandkir wdl-sihdh wdl-mashdhir of al-Maqdisf s student al-Husayn b. Ibrahim al-Jawzaqanl (d. 543/1148-9), the author does not appear to have relied on earlier books of transmitter criticism as much as al-Maqdisi did. The correlation is nonetheless noteworthy. In a random sample I collected of seventy-three hadiths from the AbdtlU 45% appear in the above-listed selection of earlier books of transmitter criticism.103 This statistic, lower than what I found in the case of al-Maqdisi, is congruent with al-Jawzaqanfs distinctly independent critical leanings. An austere hadlth-oriented Shafi'l from Khurasan, he was such a vehement opponent of Shiism that he rejected the widely-held Sunni belief that the messianic figure 101) See al-Maqdisi, Tadhkira, starting from hadiths #1-81 (76/81); from hadiths #536-45 (10/10); from hadiths #722-730 (9/9). 102) Al-Maqdisi, Dhakhirat al-huffdz, 1:189. 103) Al-Jawzaqanl, al-AbdtiU pgs. 32-42; 49-51; 66-74; 87-98; 102-13; 114-25; 129-35; 138-48; 161-8; 196-202; 232-40; 327-39; 353-4 (as this book contains both hadiths that the author feels are forged as well as those he feels are authentic, only the hadiths he deemed forged are included in this sample).</page><page sequence="38">1 80 J.A.

Instead, he produced an obscure hadlth stating, "There is no messiah except Jesus the son of Mary."104 Al-Jawzaqanl's dismissal of material other- wise considered reliable by mainstream Sunnism explains why his collection contains so many previously unnoticed 'forgeries.' Al- Jawzaqanl's reliance on the transmitter-criticism paradigm, however, is nonetheless obvious in his Kitdb al-abdtik for every hadlth he rejects except one, he justifies his decision by recourse to criticisms of the isndd or its transmitters.105 The Kitdb al-mawdudt of Ibn al-Jawzi, one of the most famous books of forged hadiths, continues this trend of reliance on earlier books of transmitter criticism. Because he provides full isndds for all the hadiths he judges to be forged, we can see exactly what sources he consulted. In the first volume of the three-volume 1966- 68 Medina edition of the work, the isndds of 44% of the hadiths that Ibn al-Jawzi rejects lead back directly through the weak trans- mitter works of Ibn Adi, Ibn Hibban, al-'Uqayll, al-Hakim or Abu al-Fath Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Azdi (d. 374/985). This statistic does not even count the hadiths that Ibn al-Jawzi criticizes and occurred in these earlier works but whose isndds Ibn al-Jawzi did not trace back to the Prophet directly through the books. In the first mawdudt book based solely on content criticism, the Mandr al-munifof Ibn al-Qayyim, the foundational role of the early books of transmitter criticism is equally prominent. Of fifty hadiths that I selected at random from the book, 62% are also found in our afore-mentioned selection of earlier books of transmitter criticism.106 Of course, what one hadlth critic sees as a blatant contradiction between a report and the established tenets of Islam another may easily reconcile. Just because Ibn al-Qayyim considered a hadlth that debases blacks to be unacceptable because it did not befit the Prophet, we cannot be sure that Ibn Hanbal deemed it munkar in 104) Al-JawzaqanI, al-AbatiU 167. 105) Ibid., 349. 106) por thc sampled hadiths, see Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Mandr al-munif, 213-18 of the index of forged hadiths (individual hadiths only).</page><page sequence="39">JA.

The high correlation between the first book strictly devoted to content criticism and this selection of earlier books of transmitter criticism also strongly suggests that scholars like al-Bukhari and Ibn Adi included an appreciable number of hadiths in their books for content reasons (again, this assumes a significant degree of diachronic continuity in what hadlth critics considered unacceptable contents). One might claim that such a correlation between later books of forged hadiths and early books of transmitter criticism is meaningless - later critics might have felt that they could only bring overt content criticism to bear on hadiths that earlier scholars had already critiqued for isndd reasons in their books of transmitter criticism. This is not the case, however, since the authors of mawdudt books drew the hadiths they criticized on the basis of content from a wide range of respected sources, such as the Musnadoi Ibn Hanbal, the Jdmi of al-Tirmidhl and even (although rarely) the Sahihayn.108 Nor did later critics limit themselves only to previously criticized material. Some identified problems in a hadlth's contents in spite of an admittedly flawless isndd. Discussing the Shiite hadiths of one narrator, al-Dhahabl reacts to the hadlth "If they take cAll as a leader (wallu) then he is a guide, guided [by God] {mahdi)" by noting that, although the hadlth has an established (mabfuz) isndd in Ibn 107) Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Mandr al-munifi 101; Ibn Qudama, al-Muntakhab min al-IUl, 66-8. 108) See, for example, al-Maqdisi, al-Tadhkira, 135 (where he criticizes the hadlth 'It an yuaddiba ahadukum waladahu khayr min al-yatasaddaqa bi-sa\ found in al-Tirmidhfs Jdmi: kitdb al-birr wa al-sila, bdb mdjd'afi adab al-walad.

He asserts, "I do not know of any criticism of it, but the report is munkar."m Conclusion Since the landmark contributions of Goldziher, Western scholars of Islam have generally accepted his conclusion that early Muslim hadlth critics looked only at the isndd and not the matn of hadiths to dis- cern their authenticity. When Western and modern Muslim scholars have argued that early critics did in fact take the contents of hadiths into consideration, they have relied on material of either dubious historical reliability or imported into the hadlth tradition from the fields of speculative theology and legal theory long after the formative period of Sunni hadlth criticism in the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th cen- turies. I am not suggesting that hadlth critics like al-Bukharl or Ibn Hanbal were forerunners of the Historical Critical Method. As generations of Western scholars have demonstrated, even the revered Sahihayn are replete with anachronistic reports that grew out of the political, legal and sectarian feuds of the first two centuries of Islam. But we need not, and indeed cannot, explain why al-Bukhari or Muslim saw the contents of one anachronistic hadlth as unacceptable while approving of another similarly anachronistic report. The fact that early hadlth critics do not seem to have applied content criticism as modern historians would construe it does not mean that they did not apply it at all. Indeed, the fifteen examples provided here from established texts of the 3rd/9th and 4th/ 10th century disprove the extreme claim of Goldziher and others. Far from having "no feeling for even the crudest anachronisms provided that the isndd is correct,"110 the examples indicate that al-Bukhari, Muslim, al-FasawI, al-Juzajanl, Ibn Khuzayma and Ibn Hibban were able and willing to practice content criticism. In their work we see a sensitivity to historical anachronism, logical impossibility, limits of thinkable thought' and 109) Al-Dhahabi, Mizan, 2:612-3. 110) Goldziher, Muslim Studies, 2:140-1.</page><page sequence="41">J.A. C Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 183 a rejection of material that contradicts what they 'knew' to be his- torically, dogmatically and legally true. The high correlation (between 45% and 95%) between later collections of forged hadlths and books of transmitter criticism from this early period strongly suggests that critics like al-Bukharl and Ibn Hibban were rejecting hadlths for content reasons even when they did not make this explicitly clear. Indeed, content criticism may well have been more of a rule than an exception. These critics' sensitivities to anachronism and logical inconsistency are undeniably attested to in the examples provided, and it seems as unlikely that they could have simply deactivated those critical filters as us modern historians consistently ignoring suspicious contents while conducting our own research. Certainly, a belief in the Prophet's foreknowledge of future events could mitigate the need for content criticism, but at minimum it seems impossible that the examples given in this article represent the only instances of content criticism in the early hadlth tradition. The reason why these early critics so rarely made this content criticism obvious is understandable. They felt themselves locked in a terrible struggle with rationalists who mocked their reliance on the isndd and saw content criticism as the only true means of evaluating the authenticity of hadlths. To acknowledge a problem in the meaning of a hadlth without arriving at that conclusion through an analysis of the isndd would affirm the rationalist methodology. For this reason, content criticism had to be concealed in the language of isndd criticism. Proving the existence of content criticism in the early period and explaining why it is not more evident complements our understanding of early Islamic legal thought. In his Ikhtildf al-hadith and his Risdla, al-Shafii suggested that it is possible to reconcile two reliable hadlths whose meanings seem incompatible.111 When the contents of a hadlth proved irretrievably incompatible with what al-Shafi'l con- sidered the established truth, however, he resorted to criticizing or impugning its isndd.112 Like al-Bukharl and the other hadlth critics, Ul) Al-Shaficl, al-Risdla, 216-17. 112) Al-Shafi'i, al-Risdla, 224-5; Ibn 'Adi, al-KdmiU 1:125.</page><page sequence="42">1 84 J.A. C Brown I Islamic Law and Society 15 (2008) 143-184 a problem in the contents of a hadlth would have to be blamed on a problem in the isndd. In his Risdla, al-Shafi'i allows us a brief glimpse of this examination of content. He states that we know the reliability of hadlths by examining their narrators, "except for a specific few hadlths, whose truthfullness or falsity is demonstrated by the transmitter narrating something the likes of which could not be or that contradicts better established evidence" (my emphasis).113 Eerik Dickinson insightfully divides the Sunni study of the hadlth corpus in the early period into two schools: those like al-Shafi'i who sought to navigate its tangles by harmonizing contrasting hadlths, and the transmitter-critics like al-Bukharl who dismissed contrasting evidence by finding flaws in its isndd.114 Perhaps these two schools were but facets of the same approach. Just as al-Shafi'l provides us with the earliest list of criteria for reliable hadlth transmitters,115 so too did critics like al-Juzajanl and al-Bukhari consider the irreconcilable contents of a persons hadlths in their transmitter ratings. In both cases, content and isndd criticism were employed side by side. 113) Al-ShafiX al-Risdla, 399. 114) Dickinson, The Development of Early Sunnite Hadlth Criticism, 6-7. 115) Al-Shafrt, al-Risdla, 369 ff.</page></plain_text>
