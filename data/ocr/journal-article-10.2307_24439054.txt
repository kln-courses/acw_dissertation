<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche and Emerson: An Elective Affinity. By George Stack. Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1992. xi + 379 pp. Stack sets out to establish that "Emerson does not merely occupy the same intellectual and psychological space as the European existentialists; rather, his surprisingly radical thought entered directly into the bloodstream of this philosophical movement by way of Nietzsche." (vii) Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer are recognized as major influences, but Emerson is the thinker to whom Nietzsche constantly returns. Stack occasionally uses Heidegger's early thought to illustrate the influence of Emerson via Nietzsche upon existentialism. Stack's primary historical evidence is Nietzsche's copies of Emerson's Essays, first and second series, and The Conduct of Life. These are heavily underlined and replete with marginalia such as "Das ist recht!" expressing approval of selected passages. Written at seventeen, Nietzsche's unpublished "Fatum und Geschichte" combined titles from two of Emerson's essays, quoted Emerson's "Fate," and deals with the tensions between free action and the historical and physical factors which constitute the realm of fate. The essay is especially important because it shows the early influence of Emerson. Following Karl Jaspers, Stack believes it is "a brief overture which sounded many of the ©The Metaphilosophy Foundation and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 159 themes of (Nietzsche's) later philosophical symphony." And Stack's discussions of Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer demonstrate that while their influence on Nietzsche was significant, his response was to adopt positions much closer to those of Emerson. There is also a letter from 1866 in which Nietzsche speaks of epiphanies in which we become a "pure, contemplative, impartial eye, " (47) which recalls Emerson's image of the transparent eyeball. The majority of the book is devoted to an exposition of Nietzsche and Emerson's views on issues crucial to their thought. In addition to fate and free will, Stack discusses the death of historical Christianity, consumer culture, solitude, the will to power, the metaphorical representation of nature, science as a source of meaning, and skepticism to name just a few. The simple number of themes and their interconnections make the book repetitive at many junctures. In addition, Stack's concern that Emerson has been overlooked by Nietzsche scholars leads him to remark too often on the connection he is drawing. Although Stack is concerned to draw out the similarities in these two philosophers, he conscientiously depicts the specific variations Nietzsche makes on their common themes. As a result however much he might want to claim that Nietzsche and Emerson had similar views on fate, he admits that Nietzsche's views on the eternal recurrence of the same are at odds with Emerson's views on freedom of thought. One further strand in the argument is Nietzsche's personal admiration of Emerson. Stack presents Emerson as playing Socrates to Nietzsche's Plato, and he thinks that Emerson is the model for Zarathustra. Nietzsche's admiration even induces him to contemplate developing a vegetable garden in order to emulate his hero's solitude and independence. Chapter one, "From Emerson to Nietzsche," provides a useful overview of the entire book, allowing the reader to select from the thematically organized later chapters. Here Stack's style of exposition comes in handy, each chapter can stand alone. The first chapter also contains a short summary of each philosopher's intellectual history. My favorite chapters were two, three, and seven which deal with the anthropomorphic metaphors each develops for nature, the proper use of history, and their aristocratic radicalisms. Other chapters address power in nature, fate, the blurring of the boundaries between good and evil, and the iibermensch. One of Stack's key points is that Emerson's transcendentalism has been overemphasized. Emerson's "predominant concern was with the immanent realization of meaning, purpose, and value, with a new ethics and a new religion that he hoped would enhance human life in this world." (82) This concern comes to the forefront of Emerson's work after Nature © The Metaphilosophy Foundation and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995.</page><page sequence="3">160 BOOK REVIEWS when he turns from nature's unity to its impermanence and duplicity. This budding perspectivism in Emerson's thought prepares the way for the development of his views on compensation and fate. But even in Nature, meaning and unity are perceived in the organizing vision and language of humans. Culture is based upon critical metaphors. Emerson recognizes that the revelation that renews or replaces these metaphors is contingent and historical. Emerson and Nietzsche both turn to redemption through epiphanies, Emerson highlighting the lives of representative great men and Nietzsche emphasizing the worth of experience demonstrated by a willingness to repeat our lives. This interpretation of Emerson as an immanent naturalist is the cornerstone of Stack's thematic accommodation of the two thinkers. It prepares the way for his comments on their interests in the production of superior men as the embodiment of these temporary, but redemptive, experiences. The parallels which Stack draws between Emerson's great men and Nietzsche's iibermensch ring true in light of other common themes such as the role of fate and history. The aim of history is not more history, but the use of past achievements to produce great men. Stack elaborates their common critique of modernity, remarking on how for each the excessive accumulation of historical knowledge and its veneration results in excessive inwardness. Emerson and Nietzsche believe that modern culture is sterile because it is a culture about culture and lacks its own external impermanent monuments. And production of these monuments and great men wait upon the return of spontaneity in a race that has become in Emerson's words, "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought." Nietzsche and Emerson are able to shrug off skepticism as just one more sign of the sickness of modernity. Each is concerned more with how life is lived than with whether humans can achieve objective certainty. Stack's Emerson recognizes that the polarities and dualities of nature establish the special place of human beings. The inescapability from impermanence means that only they can authentically decide how to live. And Emerson urges that universities teach people all skepticisms and forms of unbelief so that they realize that they are "the sifters of all opinions." Both thinkers seem to hold that skepticism is overcome simply by the universal impulse to believe, but that only the aristocrats envisioned by Emerson or Nietzsche will lead culture beyond the life demeaning beliefs of the herd. Stack points out that both despaired of Christ as an image of the superior human of the future because of his lack of cheerfulness. A further agreement between Nietzsche and Emerson is the desire for a secular religion of character and self-mastery which is somehow fueled by images inspired by modern science. ©The Metaphilosophy Foundation and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1995.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 161 Although this is an historical study, Stack's specific concerns do lead to some omissions in both thinkers' intellectual biographies. The discussion of solitude and the natural superiority of powerful individuals leads the reader to expect Thoreau to make an appearance. He does not. And although there is reference to the influence of German Romanticism upon Emerson, it does not receive elaboration. Stack makes some especially provocative remarks about fictionalism in both Nietzsche and Emerson; he also alludes to the influence of Lange upon Nietzsche and Vaihinger. But beyond using fictionalism to characterize the metaphorical nature of experience, the view receives little development. However, Stack does present the conscious self as a place of illusions where we live on the surface of experience in his treatment of fate. Finally, Stack introduces Hindu thought as the source of Nietzsche's vision of the life beyond good and evil, but no attention is paid to the influence of eastern thought upon Emerson. Stack's Nietzsche becomes someone who remains open to the possibility of God as the highest power, or a moment of culmination, bringing him closer to Emerson by accepting the possibility of a higher soul. But no matter how much Nietzsche and Emerson shared an appreciation of solitude, Emerson demonstrated a commitment to social problems and the value of community in both his life and his thought. At the end of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Zarathustra leaves the higher men behind realizing that his final sin had been pity for them. Emerson is more at home with dualities, seeing individuality and community in a dialectical relationship. Nietzsche recognizes the role of fate and herd morality, but then puts the duality behind him in an attempt to construct individuality in opposition to cultural forces. So although Stack has several exciting insights on the intellectual kinship of Nietzsche and Emerson, his historical thesis leads him to blunt some of his own discussion. Did existentialism really originate in the United States with Emerson? I hope so, but that is a question for the historians.
