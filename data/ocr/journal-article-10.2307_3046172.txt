Nor have the sites and statues from which molds were made and then these replicas cast fared much better. The casts remain important records, especially where pollution and destruction have, in the intervening years, obliterated details on the originals that can still be discerned in their delicately crafted imprints. In fact, when you travel all the way to Souillac you will find the actual Isaiah relief, of exactly the same dimensions as its twin-6 feet 63/4 inches high-isolated, already moved from its original twelfth- century locus. It is a fragment stuck on the right side of the door on the dim interior west wall of the abbey church, impossible to see properly without a flashlight, which anyway flattens the stone surface, making the actual object far more distorted and theatrical than the version in the museum. The images in the Musee des Monuments franJcais have been arranged to tell a story. For those of us trying to teach or learn about medieval art, even though we might see a totally different story than the one narrated by their official order and placement, these casts are powerful tools, pre- cisely because they are not "fixed in stone." Their plaster permeability presents a canon but also a means for disrupt- ing canonicity, adding to it and filling it with unnatural others. In this respect I would argue that a canon is not made up of the actual objects but only of representations of those objects. As Frank Kermode has suggested in his discussion of the origins of the term, the canon originally referred to the sacred authority of eternally reinterpretable scripture.2 Art- historical canons, as constituted by a set of predetermined, isolated images of "great works" reproduced in books or in a series of more complex institutional replicas such as the plaster casts at the Musee des Monuments franSais, are thus, like writing, supplemental and secondary. Whether their bias be nationalist, formalist, or iconographic, canons are created not so much out of a series of worthy objects as out of the possibilities of their reproduction. For example, the paint- ings that were most enjoyed in the eighteenth century were those that could be most easily engraved and made available to a new collecting audience, just as, in the nineteenth century, the taste for Gothic ornament was directly stimu- lated by plaster reproductions. The advent of photography meant that the ideal Museum Without Walls could expand even further. In terms of the history of medieval sculpture, it was exactly those fragmentary Brancusi-like bits of stone, devoid of their original polychromy, which looked so good when dramatically lit in black-and-white photographs, that were "canonized." Henri Focillon helped place the Souillac Isaiah in the canon through analyzing its drapery, just as Rethinking the Canon Prophets, Canons, and Promising Monsters Machael Camalle I used to be almost embarrassed to admit to friends and colleagues the place where I spent so many hours with things medieval. It was constructed to be, and can still be be construed as, celebrating those aspects of art history that I had despised-triumphant nationalism, a purely stylistic taxonomy of objects, and a rigidly chronological system of their classification. The place was not even medieval, but a modern museum, and to make matters worse, none of the canonical works exhibited there was real. The pantheon of simulacra I am talking about is the collection of plaster casts at the Musee des Monuments franJcais. More recently I came across some old photographs showing how the rnoulages there were arranged before 1937, when the collection, opened by Viollet le Duc in 1883, filled a wing of the old Trocadero Palace. It was then called the Musee de Sculpture Comparee. These photographs show how the canon of French medieval sculpture was then displayed, not along stylistic and chronological lines as it is today. As its title suggests, the museum's purpose was to allow the visitor to compare, as in a museum of natural history, one species of carving to another-the ltomanesque to the Gothic leaf, for example. One photograph shows the juxtaposition of the statue of Isaiah from Souillac, which would today be consid- ered key in any canon of medieval sculpture, hanging next to a work which would not have so central a place today-part of the damaged, late thirteenth-century sculpture added to the south porch of Chartres cathedral and representing four of the mechanical arts (Fig. 1). On my last visit these two casts were still on show, one in the Romanesque Room and the other farther along, in the Early Gothic Room. Now I am less inclined to downplay my desire to behold plaster of Paris in Paris than I used to be. This is partly because the history of how objects were collected and reproduced-how canons were created-has become a ma- jor focus for art-historical research. This museum is now itself a monument (along with another favorite, the two vast Cast Courts at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London) to the nineteenth-century interest in mechanical copies made for pedagogical purposes. l But on another level these ghosts of stones have surely gained from the current fashion for phantasmatic simulation and our culture's preference for the ironic copy over the dead original. As a medievalist, however, I tend to view these plaster casts more like contact relics, made from molds taken, like Veronica's veil, from the surface of the divine prototype, thus giving them their own peculiar kind of authenticity. Floating free of their architectural</page><page sequence="2">RETHINKING THE CANON 1 99 Meyer Schapiro aided its ascent in his famous study of its social context. Contemporary students might focus on the figure's textuality (the scroll) or his sexuality (the way his thighs are scooped out of the stone), seeing sculpture not as sign but as body. The plaster Isaiah in Paris is, in this sense, part of the history of the reception of a sculptural fragment that remains in the abbey church at Souillac and constitutes part of the process of its canonization. Very consciously I have been discussing the canon not only at one remove (in the plaster cast at the Musee des Monu- ments francaais) but also at two removes (as this copy appears in an old photograph). This is because, like so many art historians of my generation, I am anxious about my relation- ship with the object. I have to admit that, during the three or four times I have seen it, the stone prophet at Souillac held me enthralled, even in the half-dark. He seems to be struggling to read and show something to his audience, to communicate about his vision to me, as he lunges forward, pointing insistently to the unfurling scroll that is his speech, gesticulating just as animatedly as I sometimes do in front of the slides that I project of him. There exist many medieval things, not only sculptures, but also all kinds of objects that can, like this prophet, withstand the repeated peeling-off of their surfaces, the milking of their visibility by an almost parasitic technology of reproduc- tion in two- and three-dimensional copies. Rather than draining them, this constant replication serves only to make them even more dynamically communicative and capable of taking on new meaning and significance. Even though being a medievalist puts me in a different relation to notions of canonicity than, say, being a modernist, I agree with T. J. Clark's observation in a recent discussion of Cezanne that certain works of art show us what it is to "represent at a certain historical moment they show us the powers and limits of a practice of knowledge."3 I suppose that one day the Isaiah might be removed from the canon as displayed in the Paris cast museum. A new director might want to highlight a different fragment of twelfth-century sculpture from this region of the Dordogne, which produced many hundreds of other examples. But this is unlikely, because the piece has a place in the history, not just of sculpture, but of the body and prophecy, despite, or perhaps because of, its having lost its original place in the abbey church. Canonical works are usually described as those that have been stripped of their contingency, their particular place in space and time, and that now stand alone as "works of art." It seems to me that precisely the opposite is the case: the truly exceptional work is one which registers, reacts to, and even redefines its particular historical circumstances, as I think the Souillac sculpture does and as Schapiro described it in his still resonant essay of 1939.4 The prophet continues to communi- cate across the centuries in different ways to different generations of beholders because of his presence in that particular place. A medieval art historian is far more likely to 1.

Paris, Musee des Monuments franSais, before 1937 (photo: Archives Photographiques d'Art et d'Histoire) want to construct a canon, not of objects, but of places, sites of pilgrimage, and performance to which one returns again and again. Liminal works, that is, works which are both spatially marginal and which cross or come between two distinct periods, often fail to achieve canonical status. A piece of medieval sculpture, which is molded in my own mental museum of monuments but which is not cast at the Musee des Monuments franSais, appears as part of the west portal of Senlis Cathedral. It is a superbly ambiguous thing, less than a foot long, part reptile, part bird, and all stone, that crouches alongside its twin on the inner edge of the left socle, alongside the Labors of the Months (Fig. 2). The reasons why this thing at Senlis is not part of the canon of medieval sculpture are not hard to fathom. Not only is its snout weathered, but also, and more important, it is temporally as well as spatially marginal, out of place, so to speak, in its place. It is a vestige of the haunted tanglewood of "Ro- 3. T. J. Clark, "Freud's Cezannne," Representations, no. 52, Fall 1995, 1 15-16. 4.

Stripped of contingency, the canoni- cal object is supposed to transcend space and time and stand autonomous. By contrast the monster is always lurking somewhere, guarding the threshold as at Senlis, or warning offthe evil eye. The canonical object is usually reduced to the purely visual level and, in its superficial visibility, has none of the somatic richness that C. Nadia Seremetakis argues has been lost in modernity what she calls the "the inundating experience of sensory flooding, shock and multiplicity."7 The monstrous, on the other hand, is all sensation, at one point soft and slimy, at another sharp and spiky. It now seems imperative to analyze the relations between the mon- strous parts of a thing rather than analyze them as discrete and separate entities.

But we now live in a visual culture in which people behold the future through clicking on icons rather than through pointing at actual things. One of the major myths of the computer revolution is that it will collapse the canon by democratizing images, making everything that can be reduced to a screen available to everyone. There is much talk about including a wider range of "others" in museums and providing new visual venues of display to minorities and previously marginalized artistic producers. The new technology, however, seems to be more Berenson than Baudrillard. Will it really liberate us from the tyranny of the canon by providing multiple images of hundreds of thousands of other objects worldwide, things which we can combine and redeploy ourselves in order to teach and explore, play and perform with the past? Or will it endlessly publicize only those canonical things owned by powerful institutions? Copyright laws will insure that these images will be sacrosanct anyway, even more inviolable to analysis and redeployment than their originals. Once facsimi- les are available, of course, the things themselves disappear into the vaults.8 I suppose it is better that students see a . . . . screen verslon o a palntlng, a manuscrlpt page, or the Souillac Isaiah than the murky xeroxes that now seem ubiquitous in undergraduate teaching. Yet I would disagree with researchers in medieval art who have embraced the new computer technology as an empowering means of historical vision, allowing them to take their classes on virtual reality trips inside and around Chartres Cathedral, for example. In this they are not only following Viollet le Duc's misplaced positivist logic, which saw the cathedrals as wonderful ma- chines, but are also further reducing their experience of the past to a single, simulated register. At the very moment when body and performance have become fundamental to art- historical concerns, our visual technology is fixing our focus firmly within the screen/picture frame. The canon and the idea of a canonical object then will not be eroded, but actually reinforced by market-driven technologies of mass 2 Monster at the edge of the inner face of the left socle of the West Portal of Senlis Cathedral, ca. 1 170 manesque" bestiality perching on one of the key examples of an "Early Gothic" portal. The sculpture from Senlis that is part of the canon, and that gets reproduced in most studies of medieval sculpture, is the Death and Assumption of the Virgin in the tympanum above, perhaps carved by the same indi- vidual who made the monster. Rather than the latter's canonical status, more pressing issues would be who controls access to it and its rapid physical deterioration, its eventual disappearance. In planning a graduate course, "Monstrosity in Medieval Art," I have begun to create a canon of monsters in which the Senlis beast has assumed an important place. Making lists of the slimy, feathery, and scaly, and comparing this example with many others, I find that it turns out to be more a dragon than a basilisk, as I first thought; its complex ancestry goes back hundreds of years and crosses three continents. Jacques Derrida has recently described how "as soon as one perceives a monster in a monster, one begins to domesticate it," which is exactly what I am doing in my search for its sources and meaning.5 Nineteenth-century canons of medieval sculpture were constructed according to a Linnean taxonomy of nature. Modernist canons, though focused more on the figurative, tended ironically toward disembodiment. Our own age, I would suggest, looks more to monsters and hybrids as paradigms, precisely because recent technological displacements and prosthetic possibilities have called into question the very notion of what bodies are. In her essay "The Promises of Monsters," historian of science Donna Haraway examines how technological transformations cre- ated "out of what is not quite a plethora of human and inhuman actors" have radically altered our categories and canons.6 Her concept of the monster would actually seem to me to be a far more promising way of thinking about classifying medieval art than the traditional notion of the canon. The advantages are obvious. Whereas the canon is a transcendent, uncreated text, like the Bible or the Torah, the monster is a material creature, a creation. Whereas the canon is constructed out of the always already known, prejudged</page><page sequence="4">RETHINKING THE CANON 201 communication. Stephen Melville and Bill Readings have recently suggested that "the art object no longer appears as object but rather as a constellation of processes, offering and offered to a series of reading heads."9 While this might be true of contemporary visual products, it seems to me that we cannot treat works from the past in this way, as things only to be read in our heads. Our images are notjust about networks but about textures. They are not read on screen but felt on flesh, and pushed out of matter even to the level of pain. In recent years the linguistic model, which for at least two decades has been so influential in our field, has gradually been replaced by one rooted less in language and more in corporeality. Emphasis upon the body will surely have an effect upon how canons are shaped in the future, and I welcome the work of those art historians who are returning to the relationship between bodies and objects both canonical and noncanonical. I did not say "return to the object" a strange Proustian phrase one hears a lot nowadays in our field, as if anyone could return, or was ever really there (at the object, or in the object) in the first place. But the danger we face as art historians is distance, losing the sensations that tie us to the material world of objects, constructing canons that would deny not only the nervous system, but also the decay of all things. I am afraid I have ended up sounding very medieval. Ultimately medieval paintings and sculptures, like all objects from the past, have to be understood as encrypted, as intimately linked with death. I have just finished a monstrous but I hope not morbid book about a single Parisian illumina- 5.

I was very conscious of not wanting to place this man called Pierre Remiet within a canon of great medieval French illuminators. 10 I came to know him too well simply to put him on that distant pedestal. It was because Remiet's repetitive and sometimes rushed illuminations have not become part of the "canon" of great works that I decided to write a whole book about his extraordinary struggle to make rather ordi- nary images. Although his art brilliantly evokes the late fourteenth-century fascination with rotting corpses, it exem- plifies and embodies rather than breaking out of the mold to become truly monstrous. Nonetheless, I think it is important to study and value this less-exalted kind of image making, to examine the whole range of more mundane visual perfor- mances that the dead have depicted for us. In Paris, when I revisit the cast museum or open one of Remiet's manuscripts at the Bibliotheque Nationale, it is not in order to worship at the shrine of actual art or to read in the inscribed traces of the historical past. It is to feel my flesh crawl and to be haunted.

This is clearly manifested, for example, in the growing inclusion of non-Western art and architecture in survey courses. 1 Considering art and architec- ture within the broadened parameters of intricate power relations has resulted in a reframing of the canon and new readings of it. On the whole, this does not mean that the traditional perspective has been replaced, but that addi- tional ways of seeing and understanding works of art and architecture have been introduced. Although at times the repositioning seems to render the conventional interpreta- tions obsolete, in its essence it only exposes meanings hitherto excluded from the discourse. Perhaps this process can best be explained by a technical term borrowed from engineering and adapted by sociology as a research tool: triangulation. Triangulation, used in land surveying to deter- mine a position, offers the possibility of multiple readings in history. InJanet Abu-Lughod's words, triangulation is based on the understanding that "there is no archimedian point outside the system from which to view historic reality."2 Undoubtedly, Edward Said's Orientalism (1979) marked a turning point in the awareness we have of viewing cultural products through a lens that highlights the underlining politics of domination. Art and architectural history have responded to Said's challenge, albeit on a more subdued scale than some other academic fields. Not surprisingly, much of this recent scholarship follows the model established by Orientalism and engages in a series of analyses focusing on works of art and architecture that contribute to the construc- tion of an "Orient." As Said himself stated, Orientalism was a study of the "West" alone. It was not intended as a cross- cultural examination and did not claim to give voice to the "other" side-an issue Said addressed in his later writings.3 Art historians have followed him and offered innovative and critical readings of Orientalism, but always focusing on the "West."4 To introduce new viewing positions on the map by listen- ing to historically repressed voices complicates any neat framing of the canon, engages it in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable dialogue, and resituates it. Yet the fruits are worth the effort. Here are two case studies: an 1830s urban design intervention in a colonial setting, the city of Algiers; and the thematic repertory of a turn-of-the-century "Orien- talist" Ottoman artist, Osman Hamdi. Colonialism and I would like to thank Diane Favro, Eve Sinaiko, and Perry Winston for their comments and suggestions. 1. Survey textbooks also reflect this trend. A remarkable example is Spiro Kostof, A Historw of Architect?ere, New York/ Oxford, 1 98S, which goes beyond mere "inclusion" and pulls the non-Western material into the heart of the argument. Kostof pairs, for example, Cairo with Florence in the late Middle Ages and Venice with Istanbul in the 1 6th century. 2. Janet Abu-Lughod, "On the Remaking of History: How to Reinvent the Past," in Barbara Kruger and Phil Mariani, eds., Remsking Historw, Seattle, Orientalism are newcomers to the discourse. While their inclusion displays the broadening in the definition of the canon, "rethinking the canon" is also about breaking through conventional interpretations. Algiers was the capital of France's most important and most problematic territorial possession outre-mer. The colo- nial city par excellence, its "modernization" was particularly charged with political overtones. The first episode of French planning that followed the conquest of Algeria in 1830 germinated the conflicts that would surface sporadically until the end of French rule in 1962. The French began their urban renewal of the city by opening an immense area, a Place Royale or Place d'Armes (later, Place du Gouverne- ment) in the heart of the city and easily accessible from the harbor-in order to assemble the troops. The initial clearing was random and resulted in an irregular plaza with haphaz- ard boundaries, soon deemed unworthy of representing the glory of France. A series of projects in the 1830s and 1840s that attempted to regularize this space into a neat geometric form, surrounded by buildings of uniform height with classical details and arcades on the ground level, responded to the call by the French administrators for an appropriate monumentality. The resulting Place du Gouvernement, with its grand image and efficiency, was accompanied by the enlargement of three existing streets, all converging on the new square: rue Bab el-Oued, rue Bab Azzoun, and rue de la Marine, now lined with "French-style" buildings with uni- form arcades (Fig. 1). These designs carried the premise that the "style of the conqueror" would carve the image of France onto the Algerian scene, and, with its aesthetic and scalar difference (which formed a dramatic contrast to the urban and architectural forms of precolonial Algiers), establish a visual order that symbolized colonial power relations.5 Historians have commonly presented the French interven- tions in al-Jaza'ir (as the city is called in Arabic) solely as examples of military and practical planning that imprinted the French victory onto the city's form and image.6 Critics of colonial urbanism, too, have emphasized the military prow- ess behind the interventions, while pointing, albeit very briefly, to the "protests of indigenous populations,"7 or blaming the schemes for their "expression of an imperialist colonization, [with its] contempt and ignorance of the subser- vient culture."8 The few scholars who have discussed the scale and content of the demolition undertaken in Algiers during the early years of the occupation have approached the topic again from the French side only, alluding to the insensitivity of the colonizer to the culture of the colonized.9 The cumulative discourse has thus reduced Algerians to an ultimate status of inertia, even when it took a critical look at colonial policies. Demolition was a particularly sensitive issue in the dense 989, 112. 3.

The abrupt violence of the first interventions made the city and its architecture contested terrains in the confrontation between the colonizer and the colonized, as revealed in the oral literature from the time of the conquest. Consider the following song that lamented the invasion and appropriation of the city and highlighted the violation of its most revered icons: O regrets for Algiers, for its houses And for its so well-kept apartments! O regrets for the town of cleanliness Whose marble and porphyry dazzled the eyes! The Christians inhabit them, their state has changed! They have degraded everything, spoiled all, the im- pure ones! They have broken down the walls of the janissaries' barracks, They have taken away the marble, the balustrades and the benches; And the iron grills which adorned the windows Have been torn away to add insult to our misfortunes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Their horses tied in our mosques. 1 l The demarcation of the French from the Algerian in the city played a central role in the creation of the notion of espace contre, or "counter space," a term coined by the Algerian sociologist Djaffar Lesbet to indicate the antagonis- tic nature of the two areas. 12 The residents of the Casbah, the heights of al-Jaza'ir left untouched by the colonizers, spoke back by turning in upon themselves, consolidating their unity, tightening and redefining their own mechanisms of maintenance and control over the public and private spaces of their neighborhoods. As interpreted by Frantz Fanon, the diametrically opposed stances of the Casbah and French Algiers abolished any possibility of overall harmony: "The two zones are opposed, but not in the service of a higher unity. Obedient to the rules of pure Aristotelian logic, they both follow the principle of reciprocal exclusivity. No concili- of Algiers prior to the French conquest has been done by Andre Raymond, "Le Centre d'Alger en 1830," Revue de l'occident musulman et de la Mediterra- nee, XXXI, no. 1, 1981, 73-81. 10. For example, the 18th-century mosque of al-Sayyida, qualified by Raymond as "one of the most elegant religious monuments of Algiers," was demolished to make room for the Place du Gouvernement. 11.

In terms of regularization of the urban fabric and the creation of monumental squares and streets, the operations in Algiers do not appear at first sight different from the practices in French towns since the seventeenth century. Yet, from Henri IV's great squares in Paris to the Place de la Concorde, and to Nancy's spectacular system of squares (Place Royale, Place de la Carriere, and the Hemicycle), demolition in French towns was minimal and the new designs were applied to vacant sites. If the compulsory acquisition law of the Napoleonic Code facilitated expropriation and demolition, it was not applied on a large scale in France until the rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. The construction of the rue de Rivoli itself under Napoleon I had called for the demolition of some structures, but no monuments, and certainly no religious or sociocultural icons, were destroyed. The situation was different in Algiers. French interven- tions were not only formally oppositional to the architecture and urbanism in place, but they diced and sliced the city, appropriating and demolishing indiscriminately. In addition to a large number of commercial and residential structures, public and religious buildings of varying sizes and degrees of 5.

As the capital of the empire, Istanbul was the prime site of new experiments, which ranged from governmental reorganization to all aspects of cultural produc- tion. Osman Hamdi (1842-1910), a prominent artist, was born into this scene. The son of Ethem Hamdi, the Grand Vezir who was particularly committed to cultural issues, Osman Hamdi enjoyed a privileged education, which included several years in Paris. There, he was drawn to the atelier of Gustave Boulanger and possibly also to that of Jean-Leon Gerome, and his own work matured under the technical and thematic influence of the French Orientalist school. Neverthe- less, his "scenes from the Orient" provide acute and persis- tent critiques of mainstream Orientalist paintings. They represent a resistant voice, whose power derives from the painter's position as an Ottoman intellectual, as well as his intimate acquaintance with the school's mental framework, techniques, and conventions. Osman Hamdi's men and women dressed in colorful garments in the Orientalist fashion and placed in "authentic" settings are thinking, questioning, and acting human beings who display none of the passivity and submissiveness attibuted to them by Euro- pean painters. Osman Hamdi addressed the major themes of Orientalist painters from his critical stance as an insider within the outside. He presented Islam as a religion that encouraged intellectual curiosity, discussion, debate, even doubt (Fig. 2). In painting after painting, his men of religion, reading and discussing books, maintain their upright posture as an expression of their human dignity, against a background of meticulously articulated architectural details. 14 Osman Ham- di's home scenes form a striking alternative to the myriad familiar and titillating views of harem and bath by French painters. Several of his works depict a couple in a tranquil domestic environment, the seated man being served coffee by the woman.l5 While the hierarchical family structure is unquestioned, the man of the house is not the omnipotent, amoral, sensual tyrant of European representations, enjoy- ing his dominion over scores of women at his mercy and pleasure. Instead, a dialogue is offered that redefines the gender relationships of Orientalist paintings. Osman Hamdi's point becomes even more acute when he focuses on a single woman. His response to Orientalism's innumerable reclining odalisques is Girl Reading (ca. 1893; Fig. 3). The painting shows a young woman stretched out on a sofa, totally immersed in a book. Her relaxed and casual pose implies that she is not reading a religious text, but perhaps a work of literature. The composition has the familiar collage of Orientalist details, but the shelves behind her are filled with books, making the statement that reading occupies an important part of her life. The "girl" is hence given back her thinking mind and intellectual life, which had been erased by Orientalist painters. Despite several exhibitions of his work in Paris salons and at the world's fairs, Osman Hamdi's attempts to correct the epistemological status of Orientalist representations re- mained overlooked in France and were not incorporated into art history's discourse on Orientalism until very recently.  2 Osman Hamdi, Discussion in Front of the Mosque, ca. 1906.

Whether presented within the history of nineteenth- century French planning or, more critically, as an example of oppressive practice, interventions in the urban fabric of Algiers have been viewed conventionally only from one side. By highlighting the colonizer as the main actor on the scene, the discourse helped to reiterate his empowerment. Yet the colonizer and the colonized existed and confronted each other within a complex interactive web, in which each exercise of power was counteracted by some form of resis- tance that redefined the shape and the balance of the relationship. Bringing the latter part of the equation into the discourse disrupts the frozen status of both the colonizer's unilateral power and the disquietening powerlessness of the colonized. Cities of the Near East and North Africa were often collapsed into an imaginary "Orient" by nineteenth-century European literary and artistic discourse; nevertheless, the political and sociocultural setting of Istanbul was very differ- ent from that of Algiers. The nineteenth century was the time of intensive westernizing reforms in the Ottoman Empire. European forms and norms, however, were not imposed by external colonization; they were initiated and implemented from within by the ruling elite, with imported expertise from</page><page sequence="8">RETHINKING THE CANON 205 3 Osman Hamdi, Girl Reading, ca. 1893.

The voice of certain alterities, kept silent by the valorized culture, begins to enter the dialogue, thereby complicating the meanings and contextual fabrics of the art objects and disrupting inherited historiographic legacies. This, in turn, helps to contest the familiar reductive formulas that explicate sociopo- litical relationships and reestablish them in their social density. 19 Furthermore, as Gayatri Spivak observes, when the "hegemonic discourse" repositions itself so that it can "oc- cupy the position of the other," it, too, becomes subject to a major transformation, to its own decolonization.20 Zeynep Celik teaches architectural history at the NewJersey Institute of Technology.

Some art is known and talked about by local populations without their knowledge ever becoming acces- sible to Western scholars. A first task is thus to establish the range and quantity of art in the world and and to improve access to knowledge of it. This process involves taking the broadest view of what is visually interesting. It also involves acknowledging the variation of concentration on different forms of art through time and across cultures. It is as important to understand why many Europeans disregard arts that they consider decorative, why many Chinese disre- gard painting that is not by literati, and why many other peoples disregard that which is old and so not functional within their social order, as it is to study the materials that they neglect. In a related area, it is highly desirable for European and North American scholars and teachers to realize that their academic interests do not necessarily set standards. There is much to learn from the activities of the numerous emerging departments concerned with the study of art in Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. Many of these divide the discipline in ways which put the whole of art into a new perspective. In India art may be seen as evenly distributed over the landmass which stretches from China to Europe, with India as a central keystone, recipient, and source of many influences. In Southeast Asia and Japan the territory of art may be divided into "Eastern" and "Western" categories. Just as the confidence of Europeans and North Americans has led to an excessive concentration on their own culture, so the absence of such pride in some Asian countries has promoted an evenhandedness which provides a model for a truly World Art view. Each non-Western institution concerned with art may have something important to offer others, including those in the West. Their diversity also reminds us that, although Western institutions often present themselves as a solid group engaged in an international discipline, they are in fact strongly affected by local interests. Departments in the United States have long adopted a broader view than those in Europe, but have become increas- ingly subject to social pressures. Those in Europe often claim to deal with art in general, yet may in reality reflect largely national priorities. In Eastern Europe the study of popular art, which developed under Communism, is now threatened with extinction. A worldwide perspective rapidly exposes the underlying disunities and incompatibilities within what we consider the single discipline of Western art history. The benefits of reappraising the full spectrum both of available material and of available approaches are nowhere more dramatic than in the context of European art. Instead of seeming so familiar and well understood that it is predict- able in its development and even boring, as it is usually presented in the literature, it reveals itself as unknown and puzzling. Europe becomes in effect a continent every bit as "dark" as Africa. In order to bring light to this situation the complete range of visually interesting material culture has to be studied, from the Palaeolithic to the present, from Portugal to the Ukraine, from folk crafts to palace decora- tion, and from artists' sketchbooks to consumer videos. Only when the multiform variety of European art is recognized is it possible to analyze and explain the unique properties of the currently canonical artistic tradition running from ancient World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art John Onians A man looks in through the glass observation window of a dolphinarium. He is smoking a cigarette and blows a puS of smoke into the air. Through the glass he sees a young female dolphin swim oS to her mother and take a suck of milk. She then returns to the window and releases it, making a white cloud in the water.l Compare this story of emulation with that of the competition between Apelles and Protogenes preserved by Pliny the Elder in Natural History (31. 81-83). Apelles goes to visit Protogenes and, finding him absent, leaves as a visiting card a very fine line painted on a panel. Protogenes comes home, sees it, and divides it by one even finer. Soon Apelles himself returns and divides it once again. At this Protogenes admits himself beaten. The latter story is part of the canon of the history of art as it is practiced today. The former might take a similar place in a new natural history of artistic activity such as that being developed at the University of East Anglia as one element in a new broad discipline, World Art Studies. The power that has brought about the transformation of the existing art history department is neither that of a theory imported from another area nor of political expediency, but that of the objects in the collection given to the university in 1975 by Sir Robert and Lady Sainsbury. Housed in an extraordinary single space designed by Sir Norman Foster, these works of art from all regions of the globe and from all periods have compelled a reassessment of traditional ap- proaches to their study. The collection was given less to help with teaching than to stimulate sensual awareness, and its impact on the central nervous systems of both staff and students proved so profound as to encourage a redefinition of the department's activities. By 1992 it had changed its name and begun a radical expansion beyond the established concerns of its specialists in art history, anthropology, archae- ology, and cultural studies. The new framework offers imme- diate advantages. It accommodates the established canon of approaches associated with teaching and research in the field of art in Western universities and indeed strengthens them by throwing into relief their distinct and competing strengths. It also favors the experiments which have led to their recent extension, as when methods familiar in one area are applied to topics popular in another, those of anthropology to Europe, of connoisseurship to Africa, or of cultural studies to China or Latin America. But perhaps the greatest single advantage of the concept of World Art Studies is that, since no one knows what it is, everyone can contribute to its definition. The change of name raises fundamental ques- tions about future developments in the study of art, requir- ing the mapping of new areas of inquiry and the formulation of new ways of exploring them. A necessary first step is a review of the total potential field. There is, for example, at present a seriously inadequate match between the pattern of artistic production worldwide and the literature. Most of the visually interesting material culture generated by Homo sapiens is poorly recorded and</page><page sequence="10">RETHINKING THE CANON 207 Greece, through Italy, to Northern Europe and North America. Categories within it, such as the life-size bronze statue, the stone building, and the painted portrait, which are often thought of as somehow normal human expressions, begin to stand out as remarkable notjust in a global, but even in a European context. The wealth of knowledge already collected in relation to such objects can then be employed in a deeper investigation. The practice adopted by some Euro- peans of representing the faces of individuals on boards and canvases, using such media as egg or oil, and then fastening them to the inner walls of houses is just as intriguing and strange as the making and ritual destruction of a New Guinea mask composed of grass, blood, and feathers. If we admit to this, we can treat the painted portrait as the curious and exceptional artifact that it is. The nature of European culture is thrown further into question when the masks with which portraits are compared are those from villages not in the Sepik headwaters, but in the Swiss Alps. If the supposed canon of European art is richly documented but poorly understood, the art that lies outside the canon is hardly even known. Similar reassessments need to be made of the art of the rest of the world, where equally successful yet narrow approaches prevail. The assumptions of Egyptologists about the art of the Nile Valley or of anthropologists about that of Oceania are, like those of European art historians, the product of the histories of particular disciplines. The princi- pal challenge is the need to create a new and larger disciplinary frame that reflects less the accidental constraints of institutional formation and more the essential complexity of art as a worldwide phenomenon. This will make it easier to confront a number of new issues which, although they are best addressed through the study of art, are of interest to all who want to understand the human species. One of these issues is the nature of the human relation to the material itself. All art involves some modification of material substances. The character of the material and the nature of the modification varies with time and place, as just noted in the case of Europe, where, in the field of painting, the binding elements may consist of egg or oil or synthetic products, and pigments, too, may be animal, vegetable, or mineral. The reasons why the combinations vary are far from simple, including both cultural and natural factors. The same is true of the instrument with which a medium may be applied, as in the case of ink drawing and writing. While Europeans have for the last two thousand years always preferred a hard reed, quill, or metal pen, the Chinese have typically used only soft brushes. Since similar oppositions exist in tableware and medical instruments, with the organic Chinese chopstick contrasting with the European metal knife and the probing needle of the Beijing acupuncturist contrast- ing with the more invasive scalpel of the Paris surgeon, it is clear that the roots of the difference in drawing techniques are to be found not in the history of art but in generically different physical engagements with a similar range of substances. These engagements might be analyzed by some- 1. C. K. Taylor and G. S. Saayman, "Imitative Behaviour by Indian Ocean Bottle Nose Dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Captivity," Behaviour, XLIV, 1973, 28S98. one concerned with the study of medicine or of cookery. This, though, is unlikely to happen. Art is the only field where the study of the human preoccupation with moditring physical substances is the core of a historical discipline. It is thus above all through a study of art that a broader account of our relation to the material might be constructed. The same is true of the study of our use of the sense of sight. There are no fields of human activity in which sight does not play a role. However, in most it is treated as marginal, whether it is so or not. This is at least partly because of the preeminence accorded to language, some- thing which happens, surprisingly, even in the context of the visual arts. There is a convention that, whether we are discussing the sculpture of the Parthenon or a Nigerian masquerade, we are dealing with manifestations whose com- plexity is largely the result of the richness of their verbal context. Only in the case of European art since the Renais- sance has the role of the eye been taken seriously and even then only in relation to particular theories of optics, to particular psychologies of perception, and to particular psychoanalytic ideas on the gaze. The period is short, the geographical area concerned is narrow, and the theories applied are limited. Many of the assumptions involved in such studies are not relevant to the rest of European art, still less to the art of the rest of the world. Since we now know that mental formation plays a major role in the operation of vision and that both what we see and the way we see it is affected by our cultural and natural environment, we need to write a history of art which is also a history of seeing. This should exploit both the records of visually based thought and action preserved in art objects and the data on visual response preserved in what we know of their use and in oral and literary testimonies relating to them. Such a history of seeing would apply to all categories of art. It would also apply to all other activities in which a visual engagement is central. It would even provide a much-needed fresh approach to the study of vision itself, allowing art historians to repay their debts to psychologists of perception, neurologists, and oth- ers on whose experimental observations they depend.2 By documenting the visual choices and responses of our prede- cessors, the history of art can tell us, as experiments with modern men and women can never do, about the history of visual experience. World Art Studies does not provide the only setting for an analysis of the human engagement with the material and with the visual, but it may provide the best. It is also likely to be the best setting for an approach to an understanding of the hand, the only organ which rivals the mouth in its capacity for articulation and in its expressive and communicative powers. As with the sense of sight, the history of art preserves an extraordinary record of human manual activity. From the first tools made by holding a stone in one hand and striking it judiciously with a stone held in the other, the history of making is the history of the hand. The appearance of more refined and complex tools and the first representations of animals and humans around 30,000 2. This process is already at work in R. L. Gregory and E. H. Gombrich, eds., Illusion in Nature and Art, London, 1973.</page><page sequence="11">208 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1996 VOLUME LXXVIII NUMBER 2 B.C. are only possible because of a much greater manual control. By the Magdalenian period, around 13,000 B.C., representations of the hand itself have become a regular feature of paintings on cave walls. From then on the hand is used to accomplish more and more subtle tasks, reaching new pitches of manipulative skill in Han lacquerwork, Italian Renaissance drawings, and Dutch seventeenth-century etch- ings, the necessary movements being learned from a master, as from a dancing-teacher, and then perfected by practice. The development of the hand follows different rules from that of the eye, the latter formed by individual experience, the former by imitative exercise, but the workings of both sets of rules are well revealed in the history of art. Once we are studying the separate operations of eye and hand and their interaction with the material, we are dealing with the essential circle which everywhere lies behind the making of art and we are close to asking some of the reasons for its very existence as a worldwide activity of Homo sapiens. The cultural context of art making, the way that it is influenced by educational, social, political, economic, reli- gious, philosophical, technical, and other factors, is compar- atively well understood. Its basis in human physiology and psychology and the human relation to the natural environ- ment is not. The reasons for the origins of artistic activity and the reasons for its abiding importance throughout a wide variety of times and places have still to be sought. A history of art which explores such issues will inevitably be less a cultural than a natural history. One such natural history could well begin with the artlike activities of animals such as the dolphin. For our human ancestors must have been involved in such activities long before they became socially controlled. The origin of art making in humans must, as with dolphins, lie in the chance results of the operation of the circuit which links eye and motor system through the brain in a modification of mate- rial. Just such a circuit lies, for example, behind a spontane- ous behavior noted in female chimpanzees, which involves gathering moss into babylike bundles and then fondling it as if it was a real child. Studying chimpanzee behavior is particularly appropriate since recent scientific findings sug- gest both that humans and chimpanzees sprang from com- mon ancestors as recently as six million years ago and that we still share 99 percent of our DNA, the code which determines our biological makeup.3 The importance of studying chim- panzees is particularly brought out by studies of a subgroup, the bonobos. Recent work shows that these remarkable relatives, although not themselves physiologically capable of speech, have the ability to follow it and can communicate, using sign languages and ideograms which require capacities for symbolization and the use of syntax once thought exclusively human.4 These and other observations suggest that most of the abilities on which speech depends, though not speech itself, are present in other primates.5 This has a general importance, since it indicates that humans are separated from other animals much less decisively than was 3. R. Byrne, The Thinking Ape: Evolutiona7y Origins of Intelligence, Oxford, 1995, 14-26. 4. S. Savage-Rumbaugh and R. Lewin, Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the thought even ten years ago. It has an additional special significance for the history of art, since it shows that the linkages between eye, brain, and hand autonomously involve many of the complex neural connections once thought to be exclusively associated with the development of language. Much of what we think of as human intelligence is shared with other primates, especially the great apes, and must be associated not with language but with the particular set of behaviors through which they accommodated to their particu- lar ecological niche. Our brains and our bodies are essen- tially those of a family of animals who for at least fifteen million years have thrived because of a unique biology. This links polychrome binocular vision and soft-tipped separable fingers through a brain capable both of storing much visually learned information about foods, predators and individual relatives, friends, and enemies, and of facilitating the devel- opment of behaviors appropriate to each. Tool making, art making, and speech are likely to have all begun as spin-offs associated with the development of other behaviors. Prob- ably only the propensities for tool making and speech have offered such clear advantages as to be genetically selected for in Homo sapiens. That for art making like that for art use is likely to be a marginal adaptation which significantly affects behavior only in particular physical environments and social contexts. Even then it may be as much pathological as socially adaptive. Within a natural history the many forms of art making and art use can be studied as behaviors interest- ing in their own right, behaviors which need to be under- stood in terms of their causes and effects before ever they are discussed in terms of their social function or political, moral, and aesthetic values. The idea of such a natural history of art may disturb some art historians. It should not. Neither the name nor the idea is new. The very first history of art known in Europe is presented by Pliny the Elder as part of his Natural History, a title which for him brings out the fact that many human activities require the processing of natural materials. His account of painting and sculpture contains much informa- tion on the history of art from Greek sources, information which resembles that relating to the history of any field of Greek culture and which has been endlessly rehearsed since. This is not, however, Pliny's main concern. What interests him is man's exploitation of such transformations of animal, vegetable, and mineral substances as those discussed earlier. His Natural History thus anticipates that proposed here in its concentration on the human engagement with the material. It may lack an acknowledgment of the roles of the eye and the hand, but the training of the hand is discussed by his younger contemporary Quintilian in his Institutions of Oratory ( 1 . 1 .27) and the role of the eye, including the place of mental formation in visual perception, is already discussed only a hundred years later by Flavius Philostratus in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana (2.22). The shortcomings of present histories of art are well illustrated by the way in which they never hint that the high Roman Empire is associated with a Human Mind, New York, 1994. 5.

Better known are the later writings on the same field by Leonardo and Ernst Gombrich. If World Art Studies, besides its many other advantages, also provides the context for writing a new natural history of art, it will only be continuing what should be a canonical tradition. Where it will be new will be in allowing a female dolphin to paint alongside Apelles. John Onians's publications include Art and Thought in the Hellenistic Age (1979) and Bearers of Meaning: The Classical Orders in Antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (1988).

Theory as a Place Adrian RiJkin Theory and History Some years ago I wrote for a collection entitled The New Art History (1986), edited by A1 Rees and Frances Borzello.l I'm not sure quite what turned out to be the critical fate of this attempt to establish some parameters for a supposed disci- pline in the making, whether it is widely read or has vanished from consideration. My own essay, "Art's Histories," al- though in some ways typically concerned with historiogra- phy, and close enough to some of the other contributions, was fairly pessimistic about the subject. It proposed that the "new art history" represented a conceptual policing of the potentially fruitful effects of interdisciplinary disintegra- tions, as well as a neutralizing into a new disciplinary canon of the politics, feminist or anticolonialist for example, that had driven and determined its development. The essay was useful in its application of a Derridean notion of framing to the object of art history's inquiries- that is, to "art," as a problematic signified. Yet it was clearly inadequate in its exemplification of what its propositions might imply for the positive construction of an alternative art history, ending up with a warning against uncritical belief in theory's capacity either to exhaust or to demystify art's meanings. If I return to it here as my starting point, this is because, in relocating it and myself within it, I want to think through something of the conditions of theory's making. I would rather do this than engage myself in a statement of its magical powers and efficacities. Since then I have avoided attempts to define or even suggest a theoretical condition for the history of art, prefer- ring to write in a mode which supposes the necessity of complex reflection and reflexivity in turning any archive into narrative, where that archive is both something that comes out of dusty boxes and is also a history of all kinds of theories. This I hold to be a reasonable outcome of my essay, and resolutely old-fashioned as a way of working. After all, it is a procedure modeled on the expositionary techniques of chapter 14 of Marx's Capital or passages from Claude Levi-Strauss in Tristes tropiques or Le Cru et le cuit, that writers as disparate as Jacques Derrida and Tzvetan Todorov have derided for their totalizing philosophical ambitions. And, as we shall see, I want the play of discourse to open out so as to reveal theory's limitations, to precipitate a challenge to its reason that we might think of as sublime in Kantian terms. But this way of writing also comes from less than canonical literary imagery and narrative forms, such as the series of science fictions that make up Doris Lessing's Canopus inArgos or Samuel Delany's Tales of Neveryon. As far as conceptualiz- ing historical time and representation is concerned, these novels offer as much material for consideration as Fernand Braudel or Jean Baudrillard have ever brought to the marketplace. They also happen to be very good on gender 1.

So I declare my fondness for treating as if they were theoretical texts that have no such overt pretensions. Re- cently I have been working with gay S/M romantic literature- the leather equivalent of pulp erotica, orJackie Collins at her best as the terrain of an offensive against certain Freudo- Lacanian models for the scrutiny of art and culture. What happens in an imaginary huis clos of gay pornography where the phallus and the penis are successfully identified the one with the other in ignorance of and without regard for the watchful veto of those Lacanian regulations that would claim that even to try to identify them is pathological? How does the theory signification that depends on the representational power of the phallus come to be modified in the light of my experiment? And how can this knowledge be brought into the history of art when the theoretical parameters of a gayer art history are often already those of post-Freudian femi- nism? Pornography, whether the novellas ofJohn Preston or the drawings of Tom of Finland, comes to stand in for an "experience" against which theory can be brought to account in a way that the now customary "reading against the grain" of the canon seems all too rarely to accomplish. There is a more rarefied counterpart to this, which is experimentally to take bodies of much older theory as adequate to modern cultural materials. For example, Condil- lac's De l'art d'e'crire, unburdened and unauthorized by a subsequent theory of language such as that of Ferdinand de Saussure or Derrida, may be brought into contiguity with the same pornography which is serving as a critique of Lacan, as a means of placing it in a way that estranges it from current routines of linguistic and gender analysis through, for example, a metaphorical aligning of Condillac's exposition of the trope "inversion" with the notion of an inverted sexuality. The Condillacian spacing of the trope, which is lateral and nonhierarchical (yet resolutely not rhizomic), provides a critique both of the overeasy use of "inversion" as if it were subversion, and a means of imagining marginality as a space within language/image as historically specific in its utterance. That is to say, I am concerned with the detailed structuring of a poetics of difference that is as much gram- matical as figural and, while particular to, not readily equated with, a state of the world. This was tentatively outlined in a recent article of mine for Texte zur Kunst, "Bitte nicht beruhren Tom mit Sebastiano, Kant und anderen," which deals with the invention of an archival history for the comparison of a flagellation (of Christ) by Sebastiano del Piombo with another (of bikers) by Tom of Finland. Follow- ing through and interweaving the genealogies and politics of the two images, the Christian flagellation is placed in a space called "sade," and the gay one in another space called "kant," thus outlining the possibility of an ethical reading beyond iconography and subject theory alike. At the same time I don't see this rather picky process of redoing bits of gay theory as distinct from some of my other recent work on Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary ideolo- gies of drawing and art criticism in France, where I have been concerned to map out the rhetorical preconditions of the production of meaning against complex parameters of historical conjuncture. In all of these instances I am con- cerned with different forms, orders, and circumstances of the duration of tropes, and hence with concepts and realizations of duration in historical narrative as it is being written. That is to say, I have stuck with the Derridean notion of framing, but I am working with it as a condition of the archive rather than as the tautological legislation of some infinite open- endedness. This is theory as pragmatics. On the whole I feel sure, and hope, that this is not simply a midlife flight into eclecticism. In part, it all too obviously reflects a relation between a genre of writing and the conditions of its production. Which is to say that the demands of contemporary academic management, peda- gogy, and going to conferences may make it all but impos- sible to give in to that oh-so-fulfilling jouissance that it is to luxuriate in the real, dusty archive during the day, before settling down to some Hegel or Zizek in the evening. Things get put together, often on demand, usually on the run, and always in response to some movement of the institution. Indeed, would there be a question of theory in quite such an acute form as it is today were we not able to fly rapidly from one location to another, and in quite large numbers, ever more frequently elaborating for ourselves theaters of disciplin- ary difference? Even thirty years ago a conference like the 1789 bicentennial "do" at the Louvre, "David contre David," would have been unthinkable. And it is this very materiality of our mass production that seems to have supported the rise of theory's status in an intensified play of generations and . . posltlons. The paradoxical effect of this situation is, on the one hand, the hypostasis of theory: it becomes the only possible starting point for work and common habitus for one's discipline as well as a means of bringing strangers into it. On the other hand, theory is neglected as a practice of philosophical inquiry, for one is inclined to tailor it for the purpose of preliminary or polemical markers, where more definitive demonstrations are anyway out of the question or always put off until tomorrow. In other words, the Derridean mode is oddly well adapted to real life, always and already a prag- matic. For me, even more oddly, the ragbag of writing I most like comes to be that which is theoretically the least rational or the most essayistic. O. K. Werckmeister's Citadel Culture, Roland Barthes's La Chambre claire, Luce Irigaray's Le Sexe qui n'en est pas un, or the Rosalind Krauss of The Optical unconsciQus in the first category; the best bits of Michael Baxandall's Patterns of Intention the chapter on Chardin, say-or the wonderfully achieved, critical feminist essayism of a Judith Williamson in the second. Yet if I were to opt for an origin for modern cultural studies in its relation to the history of art, it would be Aby Warburg's "Lecture on Serpent Ritual," which, by the same token, offers no comfort at all to the pretensions of some latter-day renderings of his scholar- ship. For neo-Warburgian iconography, on the contrary, holds little or nothing to tempt me. It rarely seems to be much more than a pale shade, a philosophically maimed parody of its original, accumulating ever more texts for</page><page sequence="14">RETHINKING THE CANON 211 images and images for texts in the hope of a new stage of truth, and bent on a manipulative and factitious hermeneutic within the regular canon of art-historical teleologies. I write this, however, as one who became an art historian because of the miraculous texture of Edgar Wind's discourse in his very last series of seminars at Oxford. Something I recall as an intellectual volupte', an incitement to pleasure in imagination both inimical to the binary of empirical scholar- ship/theory and strangely close to a Baudelairean poetic of the image. What Warburg's essay had made unnervingly obvious was that theory may become the privileged site for the exercise of historical and political imagination. The feat of memory that is embodied in the "Lecture" is sustained not by the desire to be right, but rather by that compulsive drive to an identification with alterity that is the undoing of Western knowledge, yet possible only because of its attain- ments. There is a sense in which the power of Warburg's argument comes not from the sustaining of his scholarship but from its suspension in aporia. It comes from a play between knowledge and speculation that neither loses its grounding in the scrupulous recording of material differ- ence the ethnographic descriptions nor disguises the specificity of outlook that is the effect of his formation, in a maudlin and voluntaristic empathy with the Other. In recent years I can think of two essays that might be compared to this, both by Gayatry Spivak: "The Rani of Sirmur" and "Imperialism and Sexual Difference." In both of these essays, as with Warburg, the significance of the work emerges at a point of radical interference between systems of belief and constellations of difference where the status of the text or image is undermined; where a Western canon becomes conscious of the utter relativity of its values. If in "The Rani of Sirmur" it is the historical episteme of the West that is unsettled through revealing the very effacement of that which it subjects, with "Imperialism and Sexual Differ- ence" the Baudelairean model of modernity crumbles in the unpicking of its overdeterminations. This is to argue that the value of theory is here to renounce control over the refigur- ing of the canon, and to accomplish this through a politics and an ethics of a radical displacement rather than to assert the supremacy of theory-as-such. As both of these models, Warburg and Spivak, pose a theoretical problem of knowing rather than of naming, to adopt or deploy them is, then, to pose the question of whether the history of art, as such, needs its own kind of theory; and if the venturing of it anyway risks its undoing as a discipline. The foundation of the Journal of the Warburg [and Courtauld] Institute[s], in its early days, posed precisely this theoretical question as an effect of its innova- tory practices. History and Theory Round about 1967 I fell under the incongruous spells of Tel Quel and the pedagogy of Helen Rosenau. If the horizons of the former have still to be systematically explored in the anglophone history of art (unless it has been in the work of Stephen Bann, whose essay in The New Art History [1986] remains most sympathetic to my own), the latter was prob- ably the closing of an epoch. Once, I recall, when Rosenau was working through some architectural books Ledoux, Lequeu, and others she remarked that the only thing in architecture and urban form for which she could find no Marxist explanation was the metaphysical status of the circle. I attributed this aside to an irritated and partially unfulfilled atheism. I paid little or no attention to what it meant for me to carry this curious baggage of theories and emotions into the pragmatics of professional life. As things would have it, from 1970 theoretical perplexity gave way to syllabus formation. The glorious particularity of that moment in British education, the foundation of the polytechnics, now defunct, was this: that a large cross-section of classic, 1968ish academics were rapidly drawn into a new situation in which the rules had to be made up as we went along. Historical, sociological, and literary studies came into an unprecedented, close contact with each other as well as with the practices and histories of art. There followed, unevenly and in different institutions, the high years of semiotic film and cultural studies, of new, usually Gramscian perspectives in Marxism and historical studies, of feminism in all its guises from Laura Mulvey to Sheila Rowbotham, and art history in amongst them. It found a short-lived but important forum in the "Art and Society" offshoot of History Workshop, where I think that many of the new art historians first met en masse outside art history. And where the scission between empirical history and historical theory was staged as a wider framing for the history of art. Again, this held some odd implications for the develop- ment of cultural and art-historical theory that have been largely overlooked. On the one hand, theory was instrumen- talized in the construction of interdisciplinary teaching programs, and on the other hand, and as a result, began to be taught in a reified and formulaic mode through glosses and readers on this or that element of formalism or decon- struction or whatever. For me and for colleagues in historical studies, a concept of intertextuality enabled the overlapping of art history and history "proper" so that the former was rescued from its illustrational status and the latter enlarged its field of documentation and its modes of reading. If this meant that, for us, art history began to disappear even as it was becoming "new," ironically it made it all too easy for me to overlook the significance of such important publications as Tim Clark's first two books. In adding them to our reading lists, relieved to have sornething since Frederick Antal, Meyer Schapiro, or Arnold Hauser with which to supplement Linda Nochlin, we were fascinated by his use of archive in the dusty sense. But I certainly missed out on the theoretical density with which he transformed the object of study in art history, in terms both of materials and of methods: another match or mismatch of theory and pragmatics, but one that helped to produce a new pedagogy which was to supply some of the first students for the Leeds M.A. in the social history of art, and quite a surprising number of a younger generation of art historians. It is important to note, then, that this development of a habitus for the emergence of a new art history and its theorizing was deeply and thoroughly provincial. As I have just suggested, the current significance of theory represents the cosmopolitan stage of the self-conscious professionalism of this "new."</page><page sequence="15">212 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1996 VOLUME LXXVIII NUMBER 2 The point at which this did become clear was later, when, under the brutal transformations of education in the early 1980s, our finely tuned programs of study rapidly collapsed. They were simply too expensive to be allowed to run. It was now that, left to its own devices, cut off from a daily practice of difference, my art history found the need for reflection on itself, its origins, its processes, and its destiny. One site for this, a channel for communication, was "theory," now look- ing redemptive rather than the rationale for an educational pragmatics. One space was the magazine called Block, a place where sometimes quirky and unedited thinking could flour- ish without the responsibility of legislation, though of course that did happen. Another was Les Revoltes logiques, that wonderful Parisian exit from Althusserian rigidity to a ravishing vein of reflexivity, and Jacques Rancieres's radical rereadings of Kant. My memory was Tel Quel, Wind, Rosenau, and the others revisited through over a decade of teaching and the exponential growth of cultural theory as an academic . . specla lsm. Now, another ten years on, brooding on Rosenau's prob- lematic circle, I feel that her dilemma really manifested a desire to leave something in reserve, over the boundary of explanation. I hope that my gay flagellation is just such an enigma, drawn in its space called "kant" for which theory has no adequate description. The circle was, in the end, a Kantian imaginary space. And, in all probability, the central- ity of the inexplicable and the mystery at the heart of the high Warburgian tradition itself represented a desire to confront knowledge with its limitations. This is where I would like to let the matter of theory rest. Theory understood as the key to nothing, as a utopian figure for the possiblity of noninstrumental thought, as a means of renouncing control, and escape from the ambitions of our episteme as from our professional vanity; if eclectic, then it's because of this condition as a refuge for experience, whether unresolved or limpid in its certainty.

But the balance remains delicate. A closed canon, on the one hand, risks dissolution from its swelling rivals, which encircle and im- pinge upon it; an open canon, on the other, risks expanding too far and bursting from surfeit. Drawing on a metaphor used by anthropologist Shelly Errington to describe the category "authentic art,"6 one might say that the canon is a receptacle (such as a bag) into which objects are stuffed until there exists such tremendous diversity and quantity that the receptacle threatens to dis- solve or tear. No participant in the art world would want to destroy the imaginary bag (since, after all, the canon is meaningfil only if it can be juxtaposed to whatever is noncanonical); yet because the canon takes on greater significance and value the more limited it is in scope, all the participants in the art world want their class of objects to be the last one dropped into the bag after which it would be sealed shut forever. Recent attempts by feminist art historians and scholars of non-Western and so-called primitive arts to "open up" the canon have sought to do so by exposing the male- dominated, Eurocentric power relations implicit in canon formation.7 As John Guillory, one of the leading debunkers of the literary canon, states in his critique of the inequities of . . canonlclty: The delegitimation of the canon is premised upon a structural homology between, on the one hand, the distinction of the canonical from the non-canonical, and on the other, the process of inclusion or exclusion by which social groups are represented or not represented in the exercise of power. If the latter process is perceived to determine the former, it follows that a critical practice redressing the injustice of social exclusion must "open" the canon to what is excluded, the non-canonical.8 Such attempts to reconfigure the canon in order to include previously marginalized categories of art seem, however, to have largely missed the point.9 It is not, I would argue, what is in or out of the canon that ought to be of concern to us, but rather the social structure of the canon itself that must be reconsidered. 10 Those who squabble at the gated entrance to this exclusive "club" fail, in my opinion, to ask the really 9.

Steiner Without the canon, we cease to think.-Harold Bloom Men think in myths.-Claude Levi-Strauss2 In his classic study of the caste system in India, Louis Dumont demonstrated in Homo Hierarchicus that Indian society was structured on a rigid notion of hierarchy accord- ing to which members of ranked castes lived in an ordered system legitimated by powerfil subjugating myths of origin and sacred notions of ritual purity. Attempts to overthrow the caste system have consistently failed, giving way instead to ever more segmented and subdivided gradations within caste and subcaste units. This process of aggregation (not exclusion) of new populations and social groups has insured "a certain permanence of form by integration of the extrane- ous elements."3 The canon of art history, like the caste system in India, is a rigid hierarchical system which excludes "impure" categories of art and reduces certain classes of objects to the status of untouchable. Recent attempts to overthrow the seemingly uncompromising stipulations of the canon have resulted instead in "opening it up" and enabling certain hitherto marginalized art forms to slip inside (as if unnoticed)nly then to be ranked according to well-entrenched criteria. The canon has not been overthrown; it has simply been expanded and reconfigured. Canon as Container The canon of art history, like any system founded on taxonomic hierarchy, is only meaningful, and indeed per- haps only powerful, insofar as it excludes a large body of what are deemed noncanonical and, therefore, inferior materials. Just as Mary Douglas demonstrated so convinc- ingly in Purity and Danger that the category "sacred" could not exist were it not for the presence of its base and profane counterparts, so too the canonical could not survive without its unorthodox antithesis-the noncanonical.4 Because the canon is awash in a swarming sea of rapidly multiplying impurities, its greatest enemy is the encroach- ment of foreign elements which threaten its fragile and embattled boundaries. As literary critic Harold Bloom put it in his recent, controversial book The Western Canon, "Over- My thanks to Nancy Troy for providing the opportunity to indulge myself in such a challenging and demanding topic.

Seeking piecemeal admittance for one type of putatively undervalued art or another does little to challenge the fundamental structures of inequity and hierar- chy which are inherent in the canonical order. If anything, in fact, such practices function merely to validate the canon system. Canons within Canons If the canon of art history is a highly routinized hierarchical system in which most non-Western arts have been relegated to the lowest status, each subfield within the canon is itself a structured system which embraces certain categories of objects while rejecting many others. In this regard, the canon of African art history provides an excellent example of the internal factionalism and ranking that typifies the subfields of the discipline. Burgeoning interest in African art scholarship and collect- ing during the early years of the twentieth century concen- trated primarily on wooden masks and figural sculpture from a very narrowly defined region of sub-Saharan Africa. Ne- glected were not only a huge array of arts from other parts of the continent, but also a whole range of aesthetic objects from within the delimited region itself including stools, pottery, baskets, calabashes, musical instruments, jewelry, and textiles.

Household Objects,''ll Roy Sieber, whose doctoral disserta- tion and subsequent canonical oeuvre Sculpture of Black Africa had largely defined the field of African art in the United States for the decade ofthe 1960s,l2 "opened up" the canon to include objects of adornment and household items (Fig. 1). "The study of these traditional forms has been neglected by the West," Sieber wrote in the introduction to one of the exhibition catalogues, "where attention has been focused primarily on the sculpture of Africa.''l3 Although Sieber's exhibitions drew attention to hitherto untapped domains of African art study and new potential areas of collecting and display, emphasis was still placed on the so-called traditional or customary arts. Excluded from this version of the canon were any examples of "tourist" arts, hybrid arts, and developing forms of contemporary studio arts.l4 To understand this logic of exclusion, we must begin by noting that the key criterion used to define canonical African art has always been based on a standard of cultural or ethnic purity that is, an object that is untainted by outside influence. Works made for the export trade or those representing foreign influence and inspiration have been rejected out of hand as impure or corrupt art forms. In short, any acknowl- edgment that "authentic" Africa and Africans might coexist with the West in the twentieth century has been frowned 14.

Furthermore, canonical art in Africa is possible only when it is made without regard for potential markets and, as one critic put it, "without any thought of profit, in the same spirit that an inhabitant of the Cyclades executed an idol in marble 5,000 years ago.''l5 In the field of African art (and to be sure in many other fields of art as well), the canonicity of the object can only be achieved by the death of the producer/ subject. For, death genuine or imagined limits the sup- ply and competition within the canon and thus restricts admittance. 16 Canons and Catapults In African Art in Transit I attempted to demonstrate that the expansion of the canon of African art history is closely linked to economic forces of supply and demand, where new art forms may be added to the repertoire of canonicity as old art forms become increasingly scarce.l7 This process of canon formation in the realms of African art scholarship and collecting becomes evident when we look, for example, at the "life history" of the wooden catapult, or slingshot, in the transnational African art market. Slingshots are used in rural areas by boys and young men to hunt bats and small rodents, as well as to chase away birds from fields under cultivation. Most working slingshots are simple, nonfigural, and unadorned, though occasionally less functional ones were made which were more embellished. Sometime in the mid- 1 980s, Giovanni Franco Scanzi, an Italian entrepreneur based in Ivory Coast, began to collect some of the fancier anthropomorphic and zoomorphic slingshots from the African middlemen who sell art in the marketplaces of Abidjan (Fig. 2). Commenting on Scanzi's aesthetic sensibility and good taste, his friend and colleague Jean Paul Delcourt noted in an interview that "Scanzi's genius stems from the fact that he collected a utilitarian object. He discovered the object's intrinsic beauty and thus propelled it to the category of'noble art' a domain previ- ously reserved mostly for masks and statues.''18 Scanzi's demand for carved wooden slingshots spawned a small industry entirely devoted to producing figural sling- shots for his consumption (Fig. 3). After a few years of collecting, and after having acquired several thousand ex- amples, Scanzi (with the assistance of Delcourt) published an elegant coffee-table book entitled Potomo Waka ("slingshot" in the Baule language), which featured over one hundred glossy color photographs of carved representational sling- shots from his private collection. 19 A market was born. Demand from African art collectors and tourists who had read Potomo Waka fueled the market for slingshots, thereby 16.

It is interesting to note that those who "open up" the canon of African art history to include other types of objects often refer to the fact that prior to their farsighted intervention the canon had been reserved solely for "masks and statues." Clearly, by the mid-1980s this almost mythical canon of"masks and statues" had already been expanded to include a whole range of other objects. 19.

Whether or not sling- shots are truly "canonical" yet is difficult to answer, but the process and mechanisms of canon formation are well under way and clearly revealed. Canon as Commodity A number of years ago, Harvard urbanologist Edward C. Banfield made the following observation about the relation- ship between commodity value and aesthetic appreciation: It would not be unduly cynical to say that many of the thousands who stood in line for a ten-second look at Aristotle Contemplating the Bust o+Homer [Fig. 4], after the Metropolitan Museum paid $6 million to acquire it, would as willingly have stood in line to see the $6 million in cash.20 His point is a deceptively simple one: what, if any, is the relationship between the aesthetic value of a work of art and 20. Edward C. Banfield, "Art versus Collectibles: Why Museum$ Should Be Filled with Fakes," Harpers, Aug. 1982, 34. Actually Aristotle was sold to the Metropolitan Museum at the Parke-Bernet auction of the Erickson collection on Nov. 15, 1961, for the sum of $2,300,000 not $6,000,000. The sale price, which exceeded the auction record of $875,000 set the same evening by Fragonard's La Liseuse to the National Gallery of Art, was, at the time, the highest amount paid at auction for a single work of art. Although Banfield's figures are incorrect, his point regarding the reverence for monetary value remains unaltered. For more information on the sale of the Erickson collection, see Karl E. Meyer, The Art Museum: Power, Money, Ethics, New York, 1979, 174.</page><page sequence="19">216 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1996 VOLUME LXXVIII NUMBER 2 realm exists as an island unto itself free from moral assump- tions and monetary eonsumptions, but perhaps even more interestingly his statement is remarkable because of the almost casual and unconscious connection he draws between economics and religion. Both marketplace value and reli- gious value are given equal weight in his argument as potential detractors from pure aesthetic evaluation and response. Given the ecclesiastical etymology of the word "canon," it may be fruitful to follow through a bit on this connection between economic value and religious value. Canon as Creed If one were to analyze the language that is often used to describe an aesthetic experience, the words which people choose to express themselves could often be interchangeable with those used to describe a religious or spiritual episode. Listen, for example, to Clive Bell as he describes an aesthetic experience in his well-known bookArt: To appreciate a work of art we need bring with us nothing from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no familiarity with its emotions. Art transports us from the world of man's activity to a world of aesthetic exaltation. For a moment we are shut off from human interests; our anticipations and memories are arrested; we are lifted above the stream of life.25 Now compare Bell's words with those used by Emile Durkheim in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life to recount the birth of the religious experience among the Australian Aborigines: When they are once come together, a sort of electricity is formed by their collecting which quickly transports them to an extraordinary degree of exaltation.... They are so far removed from their ordinary conditions of life . . . that they must set themselves outside of and above their ordinary morals.... At a determined moment they are transported into a special world, entirely different from the one where they ordinarily live, and into an environ- ment filled with exceptionally intense forces that take hold of them and metamorphose them.26 The parallels between these two passages are sufficiently striking to suggest that Bell (published in 1914) might even have turned to a careful reading of Durkheim (published in 1912) in order to inform his thinking on the nature of what constitutes a pure response to art and to develop a proper lexicon of aesthetic catharsis and ecstasy. Writing in the early modern period, Bell could announce in 1914 that "Art may satisfy the religious need of an age grown too acute for dogmatic religion."27 By the end of the twentieth century, his position was confirmed by New York art dealer Andre Emmerich, for example, when he observed recently that "in a post-religious age in the West, art has assumed some of the aspects religion once had. It's a good thing to expose your children to it."28 The elevation of (some) art to the category of religion tells us far less about the decline of the Church in a skeptical age than it does about the construction of false consciousness in 3 Canon Faker: Artist carving a figural slingshot for the new "collectible" market (photo: Christopher B. Steiner) its economic value? Or, put slightly differently, can one ever hope to assess an object's aesthetic worth without taking into account its economic worth? Is there, in other words, such a thing as what Kant called in The Critique ofJudgment "a pure aesthetic value"? Or is beauty simply a function of price, rather than price being a function of beauty? These questions are significant for any reassessment of the canon of art history, for the decisions about ranking canoni- cal art objects are often mediated by market forces, where rising economic value reinforces aesthetic evaluation.21 Cyn- ics, of course, like Thorstein Veblen, would say that the correlation between aesthetic value and economic value is immediate and inextricable. "We find things beautiful," Veblen wrote in The Theory of the Leisure Class, "somewhat in proportion as they are costly."22 But art dealers and philoso- phers (a pair not often discussed in the same sentence) assure us together that the relationship between aesthetic value and economic value is entirely arbitrary. Aesthetician James O. Urmson, for example, has stated emphatically that the criterion we use to assess an object's aesthetic value can be treated, for the sake of analysis, as something entirely free from any consideration of either the object's price in the marketplace or its religious signifi- cance.23 Summarizing his perspective, David Novitz writes: "For just as there are distinctive and irreducible economic, moral, intellectual and religious values, so there are and must be wholly discrete and irreducible aesthetic values: values that cannot be explained in terms of any other values, and in terms of which we properly respond to works of art."24 Urmson's position is extraordinary not only because of its wrongheaded anthropological assumption that the aesthetic</page><page sequence="20">RETHINKING THE CANON 217 Any assault on the canon must therefore begin by unmask- ing this fetishized image of cultural sanctity and the fictitious creed of immaculate classification. The true power of the canon stems not from its various hierarchical discriminations and orderings, but rather from its mythical status through which it draws symbolic strength. What is subjectively con- structed in the ideological world of culture is made to appear in its canonical formations as a "natural" and objective entity in which mythical structures lead collective practice to unquestioning belief. In his discussion of the myth system and its relationship to the division of labor and power, Pierre Bourdieu concludes in a famous passage from Outline of a Theory of Practice that "Every established order tends to produce . . . the naturaliza- tion of its own arbitrariness."32 In other words, Bourdieu goes on to say, the world of cultural tradition (of which canons are surely a part) is "experienced as a 'natural world' and taken for granted."33 Those whose understanding or appreciation of art is structured by canonic principles whether in academia, in museums, or in popular representations of the art world profoundly misrecognize the ontological basis of the canon's existence. The canon is not, in Bourdieu's language, a "structured structure" into which art and artists must simply be made to fit; rather, it is a structuring structure which is in a continuous process of reproducing itself, mediating its iden- tity through market forces, and negating the social condi- tions of its production by covering the tracks of its arbitrary and subjective formations. In the end, then, both those who support the canon and those who seek to "open it up" should worry less about whether or not the delicate membrane of the canon structure will rupture from the inclusion of yet one more new artist or unorthodox art form. They should concern themselves, rather, with how much longer the misrecognition of the canon system can persist before its bubble bursts, and in its evanescence occasion the dissolution of a particular form of art-historical mythmaking and the deliverance of this disci- pline from the enchantment of canonic thought.

One of the ways the canon of art history removes itself from the objective conditions of social life is by elevation above the "stream of life" and, in this heightened state of suspended animation, thereby achieving a certain detachment from historical processes and the fields of social production. The canon system draws from religious discourse an attitude of sacred- ness which realizes its own redemption through the abomina- tion of the noncanonical or heretic and, to return for a moment to India, the fetishism of sacred cows. Canon as Fetish: Myth and Misrecognition Canon formation is premised on the mistaken belief that aesthetic judgments and distinctions of taste can be made under objective conditions free from moral, political, eco- nomic, and social influences. Canonical art, like divinity itself, is said to exist in a realm of its own where "the feelings that it awakens are independent of time and place, because its kingdom is not of this world."29 Those who support the canon, and all of its implications of culture- and gender- based discrimination, argue that its existence is predicated on disinterested values that transcend the partisan concerns of individuals or institutions.30 The canon exists, Harold Bloom tells us, "in order to impose limits, to set a standard of measurement that is anything but political or moral.''31 21.
