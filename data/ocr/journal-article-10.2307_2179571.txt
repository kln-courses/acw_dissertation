<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. IN a study of some recent books by Max Scheler, Ernst Troeltsch, Jonas Cohn, Wilhelm Ostwald, August Messer, Rudolf Otto, Julius Schultz, Albert Schweitzer, and others, one fact struck the writer more than any other. Contemporary German philosophy' places an emphasis not merely upon the philosophy of values but upon philosophy in general as directly, vitally, and necessarily related to human weal and woe, as responsible for civilization or for the collapse of civilization; in short, upon philosophy as not merely a discipline of theoretical intellectualizing but as a practical instrument in the solution of all the most vital human and cultural problems. Such a point of view is almost wholly lacking in contemporary American philosophy. This strong emphasis in present-day German philosophy is, of course, nothing new in philosophical development. The practical and culture-value emphasis in philosophy is as old as the history of philosophy itself. Plato and Aristotle and even the less prominent lights in the philosophical firmament of ancient Greece were never mere theorists or philosophical hair- splitters. Their interest in philosophical speculation was never divorced from their interest in humanity and in the advance of culture and civilization. The same has been true of most of the really significant contributors to philosophical inquiry all through the centuries. Contemporary philosophical thought here in America, how- ever, has been so singularly free from any discussions of practical or cultural values that the emphasis of present-day German philosophers is quite remarkable by contrast. American phi- losophy, in its technical periodicals as well as in its books, has 1 I take it as a matter of course that readers of THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW are, in general, familiar with contemporary British philosophy as represented by Lord Haldane, Bertrand Russell, Dean Inge, L. T. Hobhouse, et al., which shows much the same trait as the German philosophy here discussed. 434</page><page sequence="2">NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 435 been quite uniformly engaged in the discussion and elaboration of distinctly individual problems, purely from the standpoint of the specialist and because of the desire for greater clarity and understanding. To say this is by no means to underestimate the need and value of such discussion; it may readily be granted that little philosophical advance would ever be possiblewithout it. But one is reminded of the famous saying of the great Jewish sage of Nazareth: "These ye ought to have done and not to have left the other undone." That is to say, there seems to be no reasonable excuse for the almost unanimous omission of a culture-value and practical emphasis in contemporary American philosophy. Un- less it be that we have become so zealous as philosophers that we have either forgotten or grown ashamed of the fact that we are men. In either case one cannot help but wonder what sort of an individual a philosopher would be who had ceased to be a man, what sort of philosophy he might produce. Perhaps we have grown to fear the philosophical bugbear of the 'ego-centric' or of the 'socio-centric' predicament so much that we see it lurking behind every move to take serious account of human interests or needs. Or, again, we may shrink from a possible charge of 'anthropomorphism' which some of our critics might mercilessly hurl at us, were we to fall prey to the idea of a practical relationship between philosophy and life or between philosophy and civilization. Some of us, most assuredly, would find life hard if our critics were to call either us or our speculations 'unscientific.' If there is a single word before which even learned and scholarly men have come to tremble it is this word 'scientific.' And the fear, perchance, of invoking the wrath of the critics upon our defenseless heads has induced some of us to make strange alliances and to forget and forsake some of philosophy's most ancient and treasured associations. In all fairness to contemporary American philosophy one other possible reason for its neglect of the practical implications of philosophy for the life and development of mankind should be mentioned. Some might argue that the supreme practical and humanitarian interest of contemporary European philosophy is largely due to the reaction aroused by the very practical and</page><page sequence="3">436 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXV. devastating experiences of the war and post-bellum periods in the lands more directly affected by that great struggle. That, in other words, we who were far from the actual battlefields and got into the fray rather late have been able to keep our objective and scientific temperament and are thus capable of looking at the world and at its practical interests and personal meanings (if such there are) dispassionately; that Europe, on the other hand, for the time being at least, is largely incapacitated for any objective and disinterested Weltanschauung and that its philo- sophical emphasis on practical values and cultural achievements is an outgrowth of an overheated brain, the result of agonizing experiences; in brief, that our philosophy is normal while Europe's momentary philosophizing under the circumstances can hardly be expected to be anything other than abnormal. There are two refutations to this statement which sounds so plausible. In the first place, a Weltanschauung which is wholly objective (in the sense of having nothing subjective in it at all) is neither desirable nor possible. It is not desirable because it omits a most significant part of its Welt, namely the subject. And it is not possible simply because no philosopher is ever able to eliminate himself entirely from his philosophizings. In the second place, a large number of the volumes by German phi- losophers which I have just perused were written and some of them published before the war,2 which proves sufficiently that it is neither the difference of distance from the battlefields nor the direct effect of the war which lies at the base of the lack of practical emphasis on our part and of its significant place in the philosophy of the Europeans. But, however that may be and whatever the reasons for it, the fact itself remains that contemporary American philosophy has been and is today-more so than ever before-so extremely objective in its interest and output that there is little or no relation discernible between it and the great practical affairs of mankind. While we over here are racking our brains in dispu- tations over words and their shades of meaning and in similar 2 Cf., for example, Max Scheler, Vom Umsturz der Werte, Vorrede, p. 3; Wilhelm Ostwald, Die Philosophie der Werte, Leipzig, I9I3; Jonas Cohn, Der Sinn der gegenwaertigen Kultur, Leipzig, April, I9I4; Ernst Troeltsch, Gesammelte Schriften, Vol. I and II (both before the war); etc.</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 437 discussions, some of our European friends and colleagues are writing 'Philosophies of Civilization.' 3 The question in mind is not at all which of these two pro- ceedings is the more truly philosophical. Undoubtedly both are philosophical and both are necessary. One may be quite ready even to admit that a philosophy of civilization built on loose thinking or the careless use of words is worse than no philosophy, because it is so subtly misleading, a blind guide of the blind. But, while we admit that detailed philosophical discussion on technically minute problems is primary in time, it can hardly be admitted that it is primary in importance or in human significance. Of course, if we want to eliminate the human element from our philosophy as much as possible (in this day of the coming into their own of the social sciences!) then we may be said to be on the right track. But, as already suggested, a philosophy with man left out is a strange phenomenon. As long as we are human one would like to suggest that we do not wholly neglect the human element in our philosophizings. A Weltanschauung which omits man with his goals and aspirations, hopes and fears, desires and dismays, his longings, purposes, and strivings certainly falls short of taking into consideration the empirical Welt as we know it. For certainly the Welt about which we know anything at all includes man and his interests. Moreover, it is hard for a mere man to see how any other factors given in experience can possibly be more meaningful and more vitally significant for man than just those hopes and aspirations which actuate individual men and social groups, nations, races, and mankind in general. In our feelings of philosophical superiority' we may try to deny any recognition to these selfish impulses of men in general or of the proverbial 'man on the street.' But in their practical life even philosophers seem always to have had aspirations and hopes, longings and goals, both for themselves as individuals and for larger social groups such as family, nation, nay, all humanity. Nor have we done with these strivings by dogmatically dubbing them 'selfish 8 Cf. Albert Schweitzer, The Philosophy of Civilization, in 4 books, two of which, viz. The Decay and the Restoration of Civilization, and Civilization and Ethics have already appeared in English translation, published by A. &amp; C. Black, Ltd., London.</page><page sequence="5">438 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXV. impulses.' It is precisely the business of philosophy to study these teleological attitudes of man from as unbiased a point of view as possible in order to find out whether or not they are wholly selfish, whether or not they are unreasonable, whether or not they are inherent in human nature, whether or not they are more than mere 'castles in Spain.' They might turn out to be 'ca- thedrals in France' rather than 'castles in Spain.' That is to say, they might become actualized in flesh and blood, in stone and mortar, in achieved cultural and spiritual values, even though-like the cathedrals in France-it might take centuries or even millenia to build them. But it should be evident that they cannot be built in ever so long a period of time if there is no architectural plan evolved and laid before the people for ac- ceptance. Before we can expect to realize anything we should know what it is that we want to realize. And this, since the days of Plato's Republic, has been one of the primary tasks of philosophy. One may disagree with Plato in his suggestion that the world's rulers should be philosophers, but one must follow him in accepting for philosophy the task of pointing the way to the future development of human relations and organization. From the specific social sciences philosophy may take their results and conclusions, but it is she herself who must finally be the synthesizing factor by uniting these results. And it is philosophy which, by adding these into a theory of the universe, built as solidly as possible both on empirical facts and on rational judgments,4 does finally construct a plan for the direction of further human evolution. Philosophy may shirk her duty here, but only at the risk of losing her own soul. In order to bring out more clearly our general idea, it may not be amiss to call attention to a few direct statements and quotations illustrative of this culture-value emphasis in current German philosophy. In the case of Max Scheler it will be sufficient to recall to the reader the full caption of an essay which appeared in the first volume of his recent work on Vom Ewigen im Menschen. This caption reads: "Of the Nature of Philosophy and the Moral Condition of Philosophical Knowledge." As a matter of fact 4As a matter of fact, 'rational judgments' are themselves empirical facts.</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.1 NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 439 even the title of the two-volume work itself, Of the Eternal in Man, is illustrative of the emphasis upon man which is certainly for man a practical emphasis. But the title of the particular essay quoted is, probably, even more significant in its reference to philosophical knowledge as morally conditioned. I assume that it will be granted without much ado that current American phi- losophy either knows of no such moral conditions of philosophical knowledge or else fails to find any point of interest in such conditions. Julius Schultz, in his well known work published in 1922, Die Philosophie am Scheidewege, goes so far as to classify all past, present, and even future philosophical positions whether in ethics, metaphysics, history, or life in general under the principle of two mutually exclusive basic values. What these values are need not be touched upon here. The particular point of interest for our purpose is that Schultz's entire philosophy rests upon the principle of value and that he came to his present position largely by finding it necessary to apply his philosophical con- ceptions to the human and historical development surrounding him. This he states clearly in his "Selbstdarstellung." 5 Again, August Messer, in his personal statement concerning the development and standpoint of his philosophy, says: " I had deeply experienced that real philosophy is not speculation alien to life, but evolves from the submerging of one's self in the great questions of humanity which are bound to force themselves upon every thoughtful person." 6 This pronouncement is significant not so much for the explicit statement in a very few words of his fundamental conception of philosophy as growing out of life itself, as it is for the fact that in tone and tenor it is typical throughout of Messer's philosophical message. Two longer quotations, one from Jonas Cohn, and the other from Albert Schweitzer, may not be amiss. They are both long and explicit enough to carry their own point and thus make any elaboration unnecessary. Jonas Cohn puts it as follows: 5 In Philosophie der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungen, Vol. 3, page i6 of his own statement. 6 In Philosophie der Gegenwart, Vol. 3, page i6 of his own statement. The above translation is by the present writer.</page><page sequence="7">440 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXV. "If it be at all possible scientifically to conceive a totality of time and with it a meaning of our life in time, then that can only be the task of philosophy. "In how far and by what means philosophy is able to fulfill this task will appear in the course of this work. At the very outset, however, it can be shown by means of an historical re- minder that this work on temporal problems belongs to the essential tasks of philosophy despite the fact that according to some con- ceptions of philosophy these problems are 'unphilosophical.' "Among the innumerable definitions of philosophy there are two which appear totally to contradict each other: philosophy is the science (Wissenschaft) of the eternal-and: philosophy is the self-consciousness of the spirit of the time (des Zeitgeistes). The skeptic perhaps will unite the two in the sentence that philosophy seeks the eternal and yet always takes in place of it a merely temporal expression of the human spirit. But change can only be understood through that which endures, the con- sciousness of the temporal stands out from a background of continuity; the law, which makes change necessary, itself is un- changing, the characteristics of time itself, its continuous passing from the past to the future, are no longer subject to temporal change. Such analogies may subjectively justify a conception of that situation which is diametrically opposed to the skeptical, a conception which could be proved only by a profounder investi- gation, namely that philosophy as the striving of temporally living men after eternal truths grasps this truth in temporal life and that at least one of the conditions of temporal life consists in gradually revealing the eternal truth. Since man cannot escape from time, contamination with the temporal can, of course, never entirely disappear. But a necessary source of error becomes harmless after one has come to recognize it. The consciousness of the temporal juncture, therefore, most certainly belongs to philosophy because it enables us to think eternal truths purer. Yet this would still remain a rather external relation. Moreover: the temporal juncture is not alien to the evolution of the human mind; rather the very fact that times differ essentially is precisely a consequence of that evolution. Knowledge of the last juncture of time is therefore an essential part of the self-knowledge of the</page><page sequence="8">No. 5.1 NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 44I spirit, and in his own self the spirit must find the eternal in so far as he can find it at all." 7 Schweitzer's statements are still more explicit, as the following examples will show. He says: "The value of any philosophy is in the last resort to be measured by its capacity or incapacity to transform itself into a living philosophy of the people." 8 "But philosophy philosophized about everything except civi- lization. She went on working undeviatingly at the establish- ment of a theoretical view of the universe, as though by means of it everything could be restored, and did not reflect that this theory, even if it were completed, would be constructed only out of history and science, and would accordingly be unoptimistic and unethical, and would remain forever an 'impotent theory of the universe,' which could never call forth the energies needed for the maintenance of the ideals of civilization. "So little did philosophy philosophize about civilization that she did not even notice that she herself and the age along with her were losing more and more of it. In the hour of peril the watch- man who ought to have kept us awake was himself asleep, and the result was that we put up no fight at all on behalf of our civi- lization. " I " The development of civilization comes about-to put it quite generally-by individual men thinking out ideals which aim at the progress of the whole, and then so fitting them to the realities of life that they assume the shape in which they can influence most effectively the circumstances of the time. A man's ability to be a pioneer of progress, that is, to understand what civilization is and to work for it, depends, therefore, on his being a thinker and on his being free." 10 "The reconstruction of our age, then, can begin only with a reconstruction of a theory of the universe. There is hardly any- thing more urgent in its claim on us than this which seems to be so far off and abstract. Only when we have made ourselves at 7 In Der Sinn der gegenwaertigen Kultur, pp. 2-3; Leipzig, I9I4.

[VOL.

It is from new ideas that we must build history anew." 11 These few quotations could be multiplied without number from other expressions of the men already quoted, as well as from other German philosophers. But our interest here lies not primarily in specific statements. In fact, the quotations which were cited were given only in order to substantiate the assertion of the general emphasis upon a vital and necessary relationship between philosophy and human interests in general which is so conspicuous in contemporary German philosophy. And the choice of quota- tions was determined by the fact that the men quoted are too far apart in other fundamental philosophical viewpoints to justify a possible charge that this general emphasis belongs simply to one school of thought. Most honest students of current American philosophy will admit that the whole emphasis of the quotations cited is foreign to us. Not that we are not familiar with its tone and application in the history of philosophy, but that we have apparently no place for it and feel no need of it in our philosophy of today. What books have been published by American philosophers, say during the last fifteen years, that contain or develop a philosophy of history or of civilization? Merely to ask the question, it seems to the writer, is to make anyone who is familiar with recent philosophical publications in America conscious of the absence of works of this nature. And this dearth is just as apparent in our technical magazines. Four-fifths of their space is occupied with problems of epistemology, and the remaining one-fifth with historic, aesthetic, system-proclaiming or -defending, theoretico- 11 Op. cit.. pp. 85-86. l2 F. J. E. Woodbridge's The Purpose of History might be cited by someone. This little volume, however, hardly pretends to be a philosophy of history, certainly not in the sense of a practical interest. But even if it were admitted as a philosophy of history it would merely be the exception that proves the rule.</page><page sequence="10">No. 5.1 NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 443 ethical, and similar discussions, and discussions dealing mostly with a very technical and often minute-even though philo- sophically interesting and helpful-point or problem. Even the pragmatists and instrumentalists among us-who of all phi- losophers might be expected to develop the practical and cultural applications of philosophy-appear generally to be dominated by biological and physical categories and thus help to emphasize this strange neglect. As concerns the new realism it is certainly quite evident that its advocates are so pre-occupied with their interest in 'pure logic,' or in 'mathematical logic' or in mathe- matical physical categories that they have no time for fruitless discussions about such useless and on the whole impossible things as a philosophy of history or of civilization! I dare not, however, bring this discussion to a close without calling attention to one more rather extreme expression of the culture-value emphasis in contemporary German philosophy. Some German writers who have recently attempted a philosophy of history and of civilization have noted not only the phenomenal, rapid and continuous decline of Kultur during the last years,'3 but have told us that this decline is only the beginning of the end. We are told that we have passed the zenith of Western civilization and are on the downward road. The end of present-day Western civilization is said to be but a matter of a few more hundred years at the most. It will be well to keep in mind that this is not the prophecy of a religious fanatic. It is the prognosti- cation of a ranking philosopher who in his two universally famous volumes has given unmistakable evidence of thorough- going scholarship, wide learning, and a knowledge of and famili- arity with facts over a range of amazing proportions.'4 Spengler's only advice is: take the inevitable stoically, for no mere man or group of men can stop the natural ebb and flow of the course of universal history. This, of course, is philosophy. And there is no dogmatic denying the possibility that this prognostication may be correct. But whether correct or not the illustration shows, 13 On this there is quite general agreement by the German philosophers mentioned above. In England the views of such men as Bertrand Russell, Dean Inge and H. G. Wells come at once to mind. 14 I refer, of course, to Oswald Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes.</page><page sequence="11">4A4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXV. though in an exaggerated form, the intense interest of German philosophy in the practical affairs of men and in the problems presented by the great question of our civilization: 'Whither?' Some heroic soul among American philosophers will probably feel inclined to answer: 'What is that to me? Philosophy was never meant to be a cheap prognosticator of the future, nor a mere handmaiden of civilization. If civilization is actually de- clining, let it decline. If this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, let us face the end heroically and uncon- cernedly. In the meantime let no such secondary considerations hinder our important work. Philosophize as long as you have a chance. If in the midst of it the end comes, let it come. I have done my duty, my work. And if the end does not come for centuries, consider how much may be accomplished in the mean- time by those who are refusing to have their strength and abilities sapped by worrying over "The Decline and Fall of the Western World."' In other words, there are undoubtedly some among us who, if they were to live to see the end, would like to be found (and killed) philosophizing, as Archimedes was found drawing his figures and circles in the sand when Marcellus' cohorts had broken into Syracuse and were taking the city by fire and sword. (One of the soldiers, it will be remembered, not knowing who the fool writing in the sand was, ran his spear through the famous mathematician.) A noble desire, perhaps, but not particularly helpful or valuable. Moreover, it would no longer be original! If nothing else moves him let the philosopher ponder that with Western civilization his own philosophy might perish and with it the laboriously developed philosophy of the entire Western world. But, to be serious, an attitude of such indifference toward mankind's hopes and fears as just described is, to say the least, unsound even in philosophy. Philosophy must not grow so abstract as to lose its contact with the concrete life which flows all around it and alone has made it possible. Sine vita non philosophia. And life for man, even for a philosopher, is primarily human life, i.e. life as lived by man. For philosophy, then, to emphasize the analysis, interpretation, and meaning of human values and interests is not at all to surrender its own field, but rather to come home, back to the place where it</page><page sequence="12">No. 5.1 NEGLECT OF A PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE. 445 had its roots, and whence its branches have, rightly, gone out to spread over the empirical universe. But regardless of how foreign to general human interests any such part of this universe may be, it is manifestly impossible to describe it in any but human terms. In view of this simple fact, we may note in passing, many of the charges by the critics of 'argumentum ad hominem' lose their point. We should like to add that nothing could be farther from our mind than to urge American philosophers to imitate European or, for that matter, any other type of philosophical research or discussion. In the very nature of the case American philosophy is younger than that of Europe. But mere youthfulness is no excuse for not wanting to stand on one's own feet. America may well be proud of the fact that she is rapidly learning to think independently. And this is no less true in philosophy than in almost every other branch of human inquiry. No one surely, objects to American philosophy blazing its own trail. But to do that need not mean deliberately to eliminate or wilfully to neglect one of the most meaningful and valuable aspects of age-old philosophical inquiry. The question is not, shall we follow in the footsteps of our forbears, or in the path marked out for us by our contemporaries in other countries. The question is rather, are we not losing a most valuable, significant, and essential part of our common philosophical heritage by this almost total neglect of practical and culture-values and by our all too general disregard of the vital relationship between philosophy and human life and its interests in general. If we are the losers by such serious omissions surely nothing but ridicule, and that deserved, can be incurred by our assertion of independence. On the other hand, any really serious omission of whatsoever kind is a mistake which must be corrected regardless of what omission anyone else may or may not have been guilty. By such correction we shall not be copying but shall be coming into our own. Should American philosophers set out to overcome this serious neglect the result, almost in the nature of the case, would from the beginning show our relative independence from the philosophy of the old world. Because of the youthfulness of our civilization and the buoyancy of our spirit it is almost unthinkable, for 29</page><page sequence="13">446 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. example, that any American could have written Spengler's book.' Just because we are the 'new world' it would be difficult for us to believe in the present decline of Western civilization even if that decline could be shown to be a fact. America is just beginning to live and therefore it is well nigh impossible for her at this stage of development to think seriously of death. When American philosophers actually undertake to write philosophies of history and of civilization, these philosophies will amply justify them- selves by their natural and inevitable diversity from those of the old world which, due to an environment which is vastly different from that of Europe, they are bound to manifest.
