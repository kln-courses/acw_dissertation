<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter seven tomb 6 In the preceding two chapters, we discussed the stratigraphic position of  Tomb 6 and its relation to Structures 195-5, 195-4, and 195-3. To brief ly  summarize, Tomb 6 was built initially as a single-chambered tomb in as- sociation with Structure 195-5 (see Figs. 5.9 and 5.10). The main chamber  was added in association with Structure 195-4 (see Figs. 5.11 and 5.13), and  the portrait heads were probably attached to the façade in association with  Structure 195-3 (see Figs. 6.7 and 6.8). The roof of the main chamber was  destroyed by a hole dug through the altar to place a final burial in the tomb  in association with Structure 195-3 (Fig. 7.1). Following this burial, the  Structure 195-3SE sector of the house was abandoned. In this chapter, we  present an analysis and interpretation of the skeletal remains and offerings  associated with Tomb 6.1 Skeletal RemaInS When Tomb 6 was excavated, a single undisturbed primary interment  (Burial 68-22) was discovered on top of the rubble from the destroyed  roof in the main chamber and a large number of disarticulated bones were  found scattered throughout and below the rubble in the main chamber and  across the f loor of the antechamber (Fig. 7.2). The analysis of the human  remains revealed that a minimum of six adult individuals were buried in  171 </page> <page sequence="2"> 172 —  T o m b  6 7.1.

Plan and profile of the Tomb 6 skeletal remains (redrawn from Mogor 1968) Burial 68-22 represents the skeletal remains of the last individual to be  buried in the tomb. These skeletal remains correspond to an adult female  who was perhaps between thirty-five and forty-five years old when she  died. Because the elite married couple who headed the Structure 195-3  household were probably the last two individuals to be buried in Tomb 6, it  appears that Burial 68-22 represents the remains of the wife, Lady 10 Naa. The burial was a fully extended supine primary with the head to the  east and feet to the west end of the main chamber. The right arm was bent  at the elbow so that the forearm rested across the stomach. The left arm was  doubled with the forearm upward so that the left hand rested near the left  side of the face. The feet were crossed with the right foot resting on top of  the left (Fig. 7.3a). Remnants of a shroud in the form of a mat covered the entire skeleton.  This mat was not a woven petate but rather strips of reeds paralleling one  another and running lengthwise, east-west, over the top of the skeleton.  The strips forming the mat may have been held together by threads, of  </page> <page sequence="4"> 174 —  T o m b  6 7.3. Burial 68-22, a female thirty-five to forty-five years old which no traces remain. Two G-35 bowls, one inside the other, were lo- cated on the north side of the skeleton near the right elbow (Fig. 7.3b). The  bowls were small and lacked tripod supports and burnished designs. No  macroscopic traces of any contents were found within them. Apart from Burial 68-22, human skeletal remains corresponding to at  least three other individuals were found in the main chamber of Tomb 6.  Foot bones from at least two of these individuals had counterparts in the  antechamber. Also, a human cervical vertebra in the main chamber had  a counterpart among human bones found on top of the altar outside the  tomb. Both cervical vertebrae not only fit together but also manifested  osteophytosis2 in the anterior margins of their bodies and bone degenera- tion in the right transverse process (Fig. 7.3c). This vertebra was probably  displaced from the main chamber when the hole was dug through the altar  and roof of the tomb to place the final burial. The fragmentary and disturbed nature of the skeletal remains does not  permit a determination of the sex or specific adult age at death of any one  </page> <page sequence="5"> T o m b  6  —  175 of these three individuals found in the main chamber. Nor is it possible to  determine the original orientation of the burials or the arrangement of any  offerings that might have accompanied them. However, the disarticulated  foot bones of two of these individuals occur in the rubble layer directly  beneath the articulated foot bones of Burial 68-22. This suggests that they  were probably buried with their heads to the east and feet to the west, like  Burial 68-22. Furthermore, the presence of a mature domestic dog, par- tially in situ, indicates that it served as an offering accompanying one of  the burials. The human remains in the antechamber included bones that have  counterparts among those in the main chamber and an additional two  minimum individuals. A multitude of other bones were found in the an- techamber, including the remains of at least two immature domestic dogs  and eight birds. Some bones from the dogs and one bird skull were among  the animal bones found in a cluster outside the tomb in front of the door. Two fragmentary skulls occur in the antechamber. One of these skulls,  located in the south niche, belonged to a female who was perhaps between  twenty-five and thirty-five years old when she died. The skull had been  painted red with a mineral pigment, perhaps hematite, of which traces  were found on the interior of a G-35 bowl from the f loor of the antecham- ber. The second skull, located on the antechamber f loor, was probably that  of a male who was perhaps between twenty-five and thirty-five years old  when he died. His skull manifested no traces of having been painted. The fact that the five earlier human burials were disturbed and scat- tered throughout the tomb, before the sixth and last individual (Burial  68-22) was laid to rest atop their remains, cannot be attributed simply to  the destruction of the tomb roof. Tomb 2 in Mound 190 at Lambityeco  contained numerous disarticulated skeletal remains even though its roof  had not been destroyed (Paddock, Mogor, and Lind 1968). Furthermore,  virtually all other tombs at Lambityeco and most of the tombs at Monte  Albán (Séjourné 1960; Autry 1973; Winter et al. 1995) contain numerous  disarticulated skeletal remains. It seems evident, then, that most of the ear- lier burials in Tomb 6 had been disturbed before the roof was destroyed to  place the last burial. Although remains of six adult individuals occur in the tomb, with the  exception of the intact primary (Burial 68-22), not all the bones of the  remaining five persons could be accounted for. Whereas smaller hand and  foot bones (phalanges in particular) were probably crushed beyond recog- nition beneath the feet of individuals who entered the tomb to place the  successive burials, many of the larger and more durable bones must have  been purposefully removed from the tomb in ancient times. This is espe- </page> <page sequence="6"> 176 —  T o m b  6 cially true of the femur, the largest and strongest bone in the human body.  Only 25 percent of the femora are accounted for in the tomb. It will be recalled that the male figures depicted in the lower friezes  in the altar complex above Tomb 6 are shown carrying a human femur in  their hand (see Fig. 6.11). The femur probably came from the individual’s  most immediate ancestor and may have served as a symbol of his hereditary  rights. Additionally, one upper frieze fragment depicts a male with a man- dible on his arm, which again may have come from his most immediate  ancestor and served as a symbol legitimizing his hereditary rights. From  these depictions, it appears that each successive noble had the femur, man- dible, and other bones (especially long bones) of his most immediate ances- tor removed from the tomb and thereby contributed to the disturbance of  the skeletal remains. As the friezes indicate, the femora and mandibles were evidently publicly  displayed as symbols of hereditary rights. However, none of these or other  human bones were found outside mortuary contexts to determine what may  have happened to them once they were removed from the tomb. Although  Fray Pedro de los Ríos, writing in 1547–1548 CE, reported that once the  f lesh decayed from the bones, the Zapotecs in the mountains south of the  valley removed them from the burial and kept them in “ossuaries made of  mortar” (Quiñones-Keber 1995:254), no such ossuaries have been found at  Lambityeco or any Classic period site in the Valley of Oaxaca. During the  Xoo phase, it is possible that the elite placed the bones of their immediate an- cestors in sacred bundles that were kept as heirlooms over many generations. A chi-square analysis of the presence or absence of bones from all the  tombs at Lambityeco seems to confirm this hypothesis. In order to deter- mine if there had been intentional removal of human bones from Tomb  6, its skeletal contents were compared to those of the other tombs from  Lambityeco taken as a group. When comparing the frequency of invento- ried anatomical elements with the expected frequency based on the mini- mum number of individuals detected in each tomb, a chi-square analysis  generates two important observations (Fig. 7.4, Table 7.1). One of them is that, in general, the human remains from Tomb 6  are poorly represented with regard to the number of minimum individu- als. Ten of the fourteen bone categories are underrepresented, especially  the long bones. Only metatarsals appear “overrepresented.” Because the  long bones are large and of compact tissue—which makes their fragmenta- tion and obliteration more difficult—their absence from Tomb 6 and their  graphic representations in the associated friezes suggest that the elite pur- posefully removed certain anatomical elements of their ancestors in order  to use them as symbols to validate their status (Lind and Urcid 1983:81). </page> <page sequence="7"> T o m b  6  —  177 7.4. Graph of chi-square results from comparisons of bones in tombs at Lambityeco The absence of small bones in the tombs is most likely due to their  obliteration as a consequence of the multiple reentries into the tombs and  the continual rearrangements of their contents. The underrepresentation of  several other large anatomical elements in Tomb 6, such as the humeri, ra- dii, tibiae, and fibulae, also suggests that this particular tomb was reopened  more often than the other tombs used in the comparison. The other tombs  yielded comparable minimum numbers of individuals yet conserved more  bones per minimum individual than Tomb 6. This may have been the re- sult of Tomb 6 being reopened more frequently to carry out rituals aimed  at the invocation and veneration of ancestors that were unrelated to mortu- ary events.

There are at least six  individuals buried in Tomb 6 and although the sex of three of them is inde- terminate, it is highly probable that they represent three married couples,  but which of the couples in the friezes is not possible to determine. Of the minimum six individuals buried in the tomb, at least four were  identified in the main chamber and an additional two in the antechamber.  Tomb 6, initially built as a single-chambered tomb in Structure 195-5,  served as the burial place for the married couple who occupied Structure  195-5 from ca. 725 to 750 CE. It is possible that the two minimum in- dividuals found among the human remains in the antechamber represent  the remains of the elite married couple who headed the Structure 195-5  household and who were buried in the antechamber, which, in Structure  195-5, was the only chamber of Tomb 6. The remaining four minimum individuals from the main chamber,  which was added to the tomb in Structure 195-4 and continued in use in  Structure 195-3, could possibly represent the elite married couples who  headed these households. The main chamber served as the burial place  for the elite married couple who headed the Structure 195-4 household  from ca. 750 to 775 CE and for the elite married couple who headed the  Structure 195-3 household from ca. 775 to 800 CE. However, the pres- ence of comparable bones from the antechamber and main chamber points  to considerable disturbance of the human remains and makes it impossible  to demonstrate with certainty which human remains correspond to which  specific individuals. Lady 10 Naa, one of the Structure 195-3 household  heads, was the last person buried in the main chamber of the tomb and the  only intact primary burial. OffeRIngS In excavating Tomb 6, two separate clusters of objects were located outside  the tomb in front of the façade—one in the area of the lintel and one in  front of the tomb door. Other objects occurred within the tomb in the  antechamber and main chamber offerings (Fig. 7.5, Table 7.2). Apart from  these clusters, many other objects were found scattered throughout the fill  in front of the façade of Tomb 6. The tomb offering consists of 187 separate objects, which may be  grouped into thirty-eight categories (Table 7.3). An analysis of these ob- jects may seem a simple and straightforward task. It is not. Tomb 6 was  opened repeatedly over a period of perhaps seventy-five years to place six  </page> <page sequence="13"> table 7.2.

In  the course of successive openings of the tomb, objects were broken and  scattered, and pieces of them were removed from the vicinity of the tomb.  Although the offering clusters certainly correspond to the location of ob- jects associated with the last entry into the tomb via its doorway, there is  no reason to believe that all of these objects were initially placed with the  last offering. Most of the objects associated with Tomb 6 occur in the lintel, door,  antechamber, and main chamber offerings. The composition of these offer- ing groups includes objects initially placed with the final offering, objects  reused from previous offerings and rearranged to form part of the final  offering, and objects partially or wholly displaced from earlier offering ar- rangements. Yet, despite their disturbed states, certain patterns are evident  within the lintel, door, antechamber, and main chamber offerings. </page> <page sequence="16"> 7.5.

The Tomb 6 lintel offering the lIntel OffeRIng The ten objects composing the lintel offering were purposefully arranged  and certainly formed part of the final offering for the Structure 195-3  household head, Lord 1 Lachi. Here it should be noted that the last burial  in Tomb 6 (Burial 68-22), that of Lady 10 Naa, does not represent the last  opening of the door to Tomb 6 because she was buried in the main cham- ber by way of a hole dug through the altar and Tomb 5 (Fig. 7.1). It seems  unlikely, then, that her burial was associated with the last arrangement of  offerings in the antechamber or in the lintel and door areas in front of the  tomb façade. Instead, these offerings would seem to be associated with  Lord 1 Lachi.3 However, the arrangement of the last offering does not cor- respond to his burial because the tomb was reopened at least once follow- ing his interment to retrieve his bones. The lintel offering included two groups of objects—one in the north  around the portrait head of Lord 1 Lachi and one in the south around the  portrait head of Lady 10 Naa (Fig. 7.6). In the north group, an urn and  three bipod effigy vases were arranged in a semicircle. Two nearly identi- cal small ceramic male effigies rested on the ledge directly north of the  portrait head of Lord 1 Lachi and a jaguar effigy vessel directly south of it.  In the south group, a bearded male effigy and a bipod effigy vase occurred  in front and on either side of the portrait head of Lady 10 Naa. A double  </page> <page sequence="20"> 190 —  T o m b  6 cup was situated on the ledge directly north of her portrait head next to the  jaguar effigy vessel. Ceramic urns and effigies are characteristic artifacts of ancient Zapotec  material culture (Caso and Bernal 1952:9). They usually consist of a cylin- drical vase around which a seated or standing figure is modeled. The lintel  offering includes one complete urn. It clearly portrays Cociyo (Fig. 7.7a). Cociyo urns are the most frequent in Xoo phase tombs at Monte Albán  (Caso and Bernal 1952:17). Like all representations of Cociyo, the Tomb 6  urn has a lower mask with a square mouth, projecting teeth, and a forked  tongue. The eyes are framed by horizontal scroll-like plaques below and  stepped plaques above. Like most representations of Cociyo, the Tomb 6  urn has a Glyph C in the headdress, a sign that appears to be the iconic ren- dition of a maize bundle over the split image of a mouth with teeth (Urcid  2002). The glyph is known to carry the semantic value of “rain” (Urcid  2001:163–165). The headdress of this urn includes at the bottom a strip that  ends on the sides with trefoil elements. Larger trefoil elements appear on  either side of the top portion of the headdress. These trefoil elements are  graphic references to budding maize (Sellen 2002:11; Urcid and Winter  2003). Hanging on the lateral sides of the headdress are two f laps that may  signal the silk of a mature ear of corn. The Tomb 6 Cociyo urn is a seated figure, 21.5 cm high, with legs  crossed and hands resting on the knees. The Cociyo is dressed in a shoulder  cape and loincloth. The cape is decorated with incised lines. A necklace  with three appliqué knots in the form of the “hairpin” sign hangs from the  neck. Based on other contexts, these signs appear to carry a semantic value  related to “humidity” or “dew” (Sellen 2002; Urcid 2005). The loincloth  manifests horizontal appliqué strips, including one that is undulating and  that alludes to “f lowing water.” Suspended from the lowest strip are three  appliqué “hairpin” signs. The Cociyo is adorned with earspools and ap- pliqué bead bracelets on each wrist. The urn is gray in color and complete  and intact with only small fragments of the fingers, appliqué bead bracelets,  and ends of some “hairpin” signs broken and missing. The two small ceramic human effigies in the lintel offering are also  gray in color but smaller in size than the Cociyo urn—one is 14.7 cm high  and the other 14.6 cm high (Fig. 7.7b). The figures have identical facial  features. Both are seated figures with legs crossed and hands resting on  the knees. Their wrists are adorned with appliqué bead bracelets and their  ears sport circular earspools. Both wear loincloths and shoulder capes that,  however, differ in details. One has incised parallel lines with incised hash  marks between them decorating the loincloth and shoulder cape. The other  has an incised herringbone design decorating the loincloth and a simple  </page> <page sequence="21"> 7.7. Ceramic effigies found in the Tomb 6 lintel offering </page> <page sequence="22"> 192 —  T o m b  6 incised line parallel to the edge of the shoulder cape. An appliqué bead  necklace also rests on the shoulder cape. Like the loincloths and shoulder capes, the headdresses differ in detail.  One has a headdress decorated with incised parallel lines and hash marks,  like those on its loincloth and shoulder cape. Five vertically placed oblong  appliqué elements (of which one is missing) top the headdress. These ele- ments may be iconic renditions of mature ears of maize. The other has the  lower part of its headdress decorated with incised crosshatching and its top  with three appliqué trefoil elements with incised outlines of trefoils with- in them representing budding maize (Sellen 2002:11; Urcid and Winter  2003). The headdresses of both effigies are backed by large vertical rect- angular pieces manifesting numerous panels (feathers?) formed by broad  incised lines. Both objects are virtually complete and intact with only a  few pieces missing from the headdress, loincloth, and foot of one of them. A final ceramic effigy from the lintel offering is a male with a pointed  beard (Fig. 7.7c). The effigy is 18.2 cm high and is rendered in a seated  position. The legs and arms are not outwardly visible, but their presence  beneath a shoulder cape and cloak is indicated. The arms appear to be  crossed over the chest beneath the cloak, and the legs also appear to be  crossed. The cloak is decorated with incised hash marks, and punctuate and  appliqué elements occur at the shoulders. The figure is adorned with plain  circular earspools and a nose ornament in the septum. The bridge of the  nose appears to be decorated with inset elements. A large bow forms the  headdress and long hair, or a headcloth, falls from beneath the bow to cover  the shoulders. He is also adorned with a necklace that manifests a double- pointed sacrificial knife as a central ornament. The figure is gray in color  and is complete and intact. Urns and similar ceramic effigies apparently functioned exclusively as  ritual objects. At Monte Albán, urns occur not only in tombs and (more  rarely) burial offerings but also in offerings found in caches in temples or  underneath stelae (Caso and Bernal 1952:9–10). Urns at Lambityeco occur  as offerings in elaborate and, more rarely, simple tombs, but none occurs in  offerings associated with individuals buried in plain graves. Even though  most urns are receptacles, they almost never contain any object or traces  of any substance (Caso and Bernal 1952:10). None of the Lambityeco urns  contains any object or macroscopic evidence of any contents within it. The bipod effigy vases are gray ceramic vessels with globular bodies,  cylindrical necks, and f lat horizontal rims. Molded effigies, usually faces of  Cociyo with Glyph C elements in his headdress, occur attached to the ves- sel neck. Two small supports occur on the exterior base of the vessel below  where the effigy is attached. These supports probably kept the vessel from  </page> <page sequence="23"> T o m b  6  —  193 tipping over because of the added weight of the effigy figure attached to  the neck; however, they also served to tip the vessel back to prominently  display the attached effigy. The supports have incised vertical lines that  probably simulate human toes. Four bipod effigy vases occur in the lintel offering (Fig. 7.7e). These  vases are not identical; each has its own unique attributes. The vessels may  be grouped into three sizes: one is small, two are medium-size, and one is  large. The small vase is complete and intact and measures only 14 cm high.  It has a simply molded Cociyo face with a Glyph C headdress. One medium size vase is 16.5 cm high and has a broken rim. It also has  a molded Cociyo face, which, however, differs in some respects from the  Cociyo on the small vase. First, it has a headband that looks like a skein of  yarn viewed sideways. Second, it has a necklace with a central pendant or  plaque. Both of these elements do not occur on the Cociyo on the small  vase. Finally, this medium-size vase has a Glyph C headdress element above  the Cociyo face, but unlike the small vase, the Glyph C was cast in a sepa- rate mold and somewhat shoddily tacked on above the Cociyo face. A second medium vase is 15.5 cm high and lacks a major portion of its  molded effigy face. The missing part was never found and must have been  removed from the area of Tomb 6 in ancient times. What remains of the  effigy is its headband, similar to the headband on the other medium-size  vase (like a skein of yarn), and the upper part of the face. The intact part  of the face retains the stepped eyebrows typical of Cociyo, indicating that  a molded face of the rain god once decorated the vase. No Glyph C occurs  as a headdress on this vase. The single large vase is 20.5 cm high and has a piece of its rim broken  and missing. This vase is unusual because it lacks a molded Cociyo face and  instead has a molded human face. The headdress includes a Glyph C ele- ment topped by a panoply of feathers, very similar to the headdresses with  Glyph C on the plaster busts of Cociyo that decorate a small temple room  in Mound 190 (see Fig. 5.3b) (Lind and Urcid 1983:84). No bipod effigy  vases with human faces have been reported from Monte Albán but a similar  one was found in Tomb 12 at Lambityeco (Zárate 1992:13, fig. 13). Effigy vases occur in tomb and burial offerings at Monte Albán (Caso  and Bernal 1952:40–42). At Lambityeco, they occur in offerings in both  elaborate and simple tombs. One has also been found in an offering with  an unusual double burial (Burial 67-1) in a plain grave, but none has been  found in offerings associated with other individuals buried in plain graves.  Although they are receptacles, rarely do the effigy vases from Monte Albán  or Lambityeco have any objects or macroscopic evidence of any substances  within them. </page> <page sequence="24"> 194 —  T o m b  6 A single gray ceramic vessel, 13.3 cm high, modeled in the form of a  jaguar, occurs in the lintel offering (Fig. 7.7d). The jaguar’s body is a bowl- like receptacle with its circular orifice opening in the jaguar’s back. The  jaguar is realistically modeled with his tongue sticking out from between  his fangs. The jaguar had its tail broken and is missing a chip out of one of  its ears. Despite being a receptacle, the jaguar effigy vase lacks macroscopic  evidence of any kind of contents. Few jaguar effigy vessels occur in tomb  offerings at Monte Albán (Caso and Bernal 1952:54–63). Only two jaguar  effigy vessels are illustrated by Caso and Bernal (1952:57, fig. 83) and these  come from Tomb 1 in the Atzompa sector of Monte Albán. At Lambityeco,  jaguar effigy vessels have been found only in offerings in elaborate tombs.  None occurs in offerings in simple tombs or plain graves. A gray ceramic double cup occurs in the lintel offering (Fig. 7.6). One  of the two cups is taller (11 cm) than the other (6.8 cm). No double cups  were found in excavations at Monte Albán. However, small effigy figures  with double cups attached to their backs are illustrated by Caso and Bernal  (1952:231–238), although none comes from Monte Albán. The Tomb 6  double cup, though, shows no evidence of having been attached to an ef- figy figure. Double cups have been found in offerings in both elaborate and  simple tombs, but not plain graves, at Lambityeco. None manifests mac- roscopic contents. Their function is unknown but they may have served as  containers for mixing liquids or powders. DISplaceD OffeRIngS In the lIntel aRea Fragmentary remains of several urns, a jaguar effigy vessel, a jaguar claw  vessel, and a carved stone tablet were found scattered throughout the fill in  front of the lintel of Tomb 6 (Fig. 7.8). These fragments must have formed  parts of lintel offerings that had been broken and scattered during any of  the many reopenings of the tomb to place later burials, retrieve bones of  immediate ancestors, and enact rituals for the ancestors. As noted above,  the lintel offering had to be removed each time the tomb was opened. There were twenty-seven urn fragments scattered throughout the fill  in front of the lintel. Although some of these fragments could be pieced  together, none could be assembled to form a complete, or even partially  complete, urn. An analysis of these fragments suggests that they come from  at least four different urns. Most of the fragments depict parts of bodies  or clothing—arms, legs, hands, feet, capes, and loincloths—and parts of  probable headdresses. The faces of the urns are, for the most part, missing,  which suggests that they may have been purposefully removed in ancient  times. </page> <page sequence="25"> T o m b  6  —  195 7.8.

Like all known urn boxes, this one had attributes of the  alligator, indicating that the box represented the surface of the Earth. The  effigy lid atop the box must have measured some 40 cm high and the box  20 cm for a total height of 60 cm. The urn is represented by twelve fragments of which six come from  the box and six (including the face) come from the lid. Fragments indicate  that the seated effigy on the lid had a shoulder cape decorated with incised  lines and a feather headdress with a Glyph C. The face is of a male whose  two eyes and mouth are visible behind a mask that is over his nose and  extends to the sides of his mouth. Caso and Bernal (1952:94–96) describe  this type of mask as a plaque with three curved elements above and teeth  below, and two scrolls that curve downward over the cheeks and inward on  either side of the mouth. Above each eye is a scroll, which Caso and Bernal  (1952:94) identify as Glyph L. The effigy has all of the attributes associated  with the Zapotec deity Pitao Cozobi, the God of Maize (Caso and Bernal  1952:94). Effigies and boxes of this type have been found at Monte Albán;  however, all have Cociyo effigies as lids, making the Pitao Cozobi lid from  Tomb 6 unique (Caso and Bernal 1952:44–45, 93). None of the other three urns represented among the fragments had its  face preserved nor manifested any special accoutrements that might allow  for the identification of a particular deity. One of these was a very large  gray urn that must have measured about 60 cm high. It was represented by  nine fragments, including one with a large hand resting on a knee with the  foot below and a portion of a wavy skirt. Other fragments appear to have  come from the arm, from one of the laterally hanging f laps of the headdress  with an incised circle, from a pectoral that included an appliqué Glyph E,  and from a diadem with an appliqué “hairpin” sign within a trefoil element  (Fig. 7.9b). This constellation of attributes suggests that the urn represented  Cociyo. The fragments from the two remaining effigy figures indicate that  they were smaller in size than the previous two urns. One of these was  represented by three fragments including a complete shoulder cape with an  arm fragment projecting from beneath it and a fragment of a feather head- dress (Fig. 7.9c). The shoulder cape was decorated with incised lines and an  appliqué element, possibly the end strap of a beaded collar. In the known  corpus of urns, shoulder capes with incised lines are exclusive features in  the representations of Cociyo and Pitao Cozobi. The urn was gray but all  its fragments manifested traces of white and red paint. It must have stood  30 cm high. The other small effigy figure was also represented by a complete shoul- der cape (Fig. 7.9d). It consisted of fragments including part of an arm and  </page> <page sequence="28"> 198 —  T o m b  6 7.10. Distribution of fragments of a jaguar effigy vessel in front of Tomb 6 hand and a portion of a foot and leg. The shoulder cape was decorated with  incised lines and appliqué “hairpin” signs. It must have measured around  15 cm high. This effigy may have been part of a set of four that included  the two effigies illustrated in Fig. 7.7b. Four fragments from a large jaguar effigy vessel were found scattered  throughout the fill in front of the façade of Tomb 6 (Fig. 7.10). Unlike the  </page> <page sequence="29"> T o m b  6  —  199 small gray jaguar effigy vessel from the lintel offering, the large jaguar ef- figy vessel probably measured 50 cm high and was orange instead of gray.  The four fragments, of which two are illustrated, include a portion of the  upper jaw, part of an eye, and parts of two paws with claws (Fig. 7.9e).  Because of its orange color, it is tempting to suggest that the jaguar effigy  vessel formed part of the offering that included the unusual orange Pitao  Cozobi urn. An orange ceramic claw from a jaguar claw vessel was found in the fill  but no photo or three-dimensional location of this object is available. The  claw had a horizontal appliqué strip at its proximal end, simulating the area  of a feline foot where the claw retracts into the paw, which is why it is con- sidered a jaguar, and not bat, claw vessel. Because it was large and orange  in color it may have formed part of the offering that included the orange  jaguar effigy vessel and orange Pitao Cozobi urn. Two fragments of a stone tablet with a carved inscription on it were  widely separated from one another in the fill in front of the tomb’s facade.  One fragment was located on the far north side of the façade at a level just  below the lintel, and the other was on the south side in the area of the door  offering. The assembled fragments measure 28 cm long and 17 cm high  (Fig. 7.11). Only one side of the tablet is carved and its right half is missing. A con- ventionalized, not realistic, depiction of a noble female profiled in a seated  position occurs on the left half of the tablet. The top of her head above the  eye was broken and missing so that it is not possible to determine what type  of hairstyle or headdress she might have worn. She is adorned with a bead  necklace and large circular earspools. She is barefoot and wears a shawl  decorated with incised crosshatching. Although her arm comes out from  beneath the shawl, it is in a damaged area of the stone and only her hand  extending from beneath the chin is preserved. Immediately in front of her,  between her hand and feet, are two bar numerals with a Glyph J on top of  them rendering her name, Lady 10 Naa, whose portrait head decorates the  façade of Tomb 6. A speech scroll with two marks emanates from the area  above her nose. The preserved far right side of the stone manifests a great deal of dam- age. In its lower section, directly in front of the name glyph Lady 10 Naa,  are traces of two dots in a vertical column indicating the numeral 2. The  area above the coefficient has traces of a Glyph V, two eyes of an alliga- tor placed at either side of an undulating band in a vertical position. This  suggests that the male figure who was rendered on the missing right half  of the tablet was the apical ancestor of the altar, Lord 2 Alligator, adding  the important detail that his calendar name included the numeral 2. The  </page> <page sequence="30"> 200 —  T o m b  6 7.11.

Only nineteen of the twenty-one objects  in the door offering were located three-dimensionally. Two tiny obsidian  awls were sifted from the earth around the area of the door. Of the nineteen  objects located three dimensionally, eleven occur to the north of the door  and eight to the south. The north group includes two spiked braziers, four  </page> <page sequence="31"> T o m b  6  —  201 7.12. The Tomb 6 door offering ladle censers, and five small G-35 bowls. The south group consists of three  ladle censers and five small G-35 bowls (Fig. 7.5). The distribution of the ten G-35 bowls in the door offering appears  patterned (Fig. 7.13, Table 7.4). Two small G-35 bowls were placed in a  vertical position on either side of the door jambs (#4 and #10 in Fig. 7.13).  In front of each of these are an additional two small G-35 bowls on top of  one another. The two in the north (in front of #4) occur one (#2) inside  the other (#3) in a nearly upright position. The two in the south (in front  of #10) are inverted, one (#8) on top of the other (#9). In addition, a small  G-35 bowl (#5) in a nearly upright position is situated in front of the north  door jamb. For the pattern burnished designs on the interior bases of these  G-35 bowls see Figure 7.14 and Table 7.4. G-35 bowls were most likely used as food-serving vessels in Zapotec  daily life during the Xoo phase, as common at Zapotec meals as din- ner plates are with us (Fig. 7.15a). As mortuary offerings, however, no  G-35 bowls have been noted to contain macroscopic remnants of food.  Frequently, G-35 bowls are found stacked one inside another, inverted, or  placed on edge in tomb and burial offerings, as in the Tomb 6 door of- fering. Although this suggests that they may not have been containers for  offerings of food but symbolic offerings of food bowls the deceased was to  take to the hereafter, it seems more likely that the stacking, inverting, or  placing on edge ref lects reuse of the bowls from previous offerings once  </page> <page sequence="32"> 202 —  T o m b  6 7.13. Plan and profile of the distribution of G-35 and K-14 bowls in Tomb 6 the food in them had decayed. However, at least two examples (#1 and #3  in Fig. 7.13) contain remnants of white plaster in them, which suggests that  they were reused from earlier offerings to hold wet plaster that was applied  to the façade or other parts of Tomb 6. The seven gray ladle censers in the door offering have tiny holes in  their bases made by poking a stick-like object through them when the clay  was moist and pliable. All of the “pans” have smudged interiors, indicating  that they were used to carry copal, a sweet-smelling incense (Fig. 7.15b,  Table 7.5). All except two of the ladle censers in the door offering are bro- ken. Both of the complete and intact examples were located next to one  another directly south of the door (Fig. 7.5). One of these had traces of  carbon within its “pan,” probably from the glowing coals placed within to  serve as a base on which to place and ignite the copal resin. The other had  traces of copal adhering to the interior of its “pan.” It seems evident, then,  that these two intact ladle censers formed part of the last door offering. Ladle censers are among the most frequent type of offering found in  Xoo phase tombs at Monte Albán and Lambityeco. At Monte Albán, 423  Xoo phase ladle censers occur as tomb offerings whereas only eight were  found as offerings associated with individuals buried in plain graves (Caso,  </page> <page sequence="33"> table 7.4.

G-35 bowls, ladle censers, and spiked braziers from Tomb 6 </page> <page sequence="36"> 206 —  T o m b  6 Bernal, and Acosta 1967:434–435). At Lambityeco, ladle censers are com- mon offerings in both simple and elaborate tombs, but none has been found  as an offering associated with individuals buried in plain graves. The ex- ceptionally high frequency of ladle censers in Xoo phase tombs at Monte  Albán and Lambityeco and their total absence or rare occurrence in plain  graves may have been for practical, as well as ritual, reasons. Because the  tombs at Lambityeco and Monte Albán were opened repeatedly, the sweet- smelling copal incense carried in the ladle censers may have served to dispel  unpleasant odors as well as to ritually purify the area. Two braziers with tiny cone-like projections or “spikes” occur in the  door offering. They were found next to one another on the north side of  the door (Figs. 7.5 and 7.12). One of these vessels is in the form of a small jar  and one is in the form of a conical or f lat-based, straight-walled bowl. Both  are gray ceramic vessels, but the jar was also coated with a lime whitewash  on its exterior surface (Fig. 7.15c). The spiked jar has a rim diameter of 12.1 cm and a height of 11.4 cm.  Two vents, one in the form of a cross and the other in the form of an in- verted “T,” occur on opposite sides. The “T,” or “cloud sign,” was partly  broken, leaving a sherd from the wall of the vessel missing. This jar had two  handles, on opposite sides of the vessel, but both were broken and missing.  The exterior base of the jar had a white “X” painted on it. The spiked conical bowl has a rim diameter of 31.9 cm and a height of  15.6 cm. Unlike the jar, this bowl was not coated with a lime whitewash  and did not have conical projections over its entire surface. Instead, the  exterior wall was decorated on each of its four opposing sides by two verti- cal parallel lines of conical projections. Four simply incised crosses occur  in the areas between these parallel lines of “spikes” on the exterior vessel  wall, and an additional four simply incised crosses occur on opposing sides  of the interior vessel wall. Four horizontally placed loop handles modeled  to resemble rope occurred on the bowl rim but were broken, leaving only  their stubs intact. The bowl was broken and several large pieces are missing  from its rim. Both vessels probably functioned as braziers in which incense may have  been burned. Unlike the ladle censers, which were incense burners meant  to be carried in processions, the braziers were incense burners meant to be  set in one place. Although the spiked bowl does manifest a smudged inte- rior, suggesting incense was burned within it, the jar shows no evidence of  having had anything burnt within it. No spiked braziers are reported from  tomb or burial offerings at Monte Albán. At Lambityeco, however, spiked  braziers have been found in offerings in elaborate tombs (Paddock, Mogor,  and Lind 1968:9–10). </page> <page sequence="37"> T o m b  6  —  207 Two obsidian awls, sifted from the earth around the door offering,  were formed by bilaterally f laking the distal ends of obsidian blades to a  central point. Both were gray obsidian, probably from the Pico de Orizaba  source in Veracruz. One was 2.2 cm long, 1.3 cm wide, and 2 mm thick.  The other was 3.6 cm long, 7 mm wide, and 2 mm thick. In Zapotec daily life, obsidian awls functioned both as ritual and utili- tarian items. As ritual items, they were used to pierce ears, tongues, and, in  the case of males, the genitals, in order to obtain blood as a self-sacrificial  offering. As utilitarian items, awls functioned to bore holes in leather and  other materials. The precise function of the Tomb 6 awls is unknown,  although one expects from their context within a mortuary offering that  they might have been awls destined to a ritual function DISplaceD OffeRIngS An additional sixteen objects, mostly fragmentary, were located outside  any offering context in the fill in front of Tomb 6. Among the objects are  three braziers, four G-35 bowls, one miniature subhemispherical bowl,  one hemispherical bowl, two large storage jars, two obsidian blades, and  three shell ornaments. The shell ornaments probably came from previous  antechamber or main chamber offerings. Fragments from at least three braziers were recovered and none of  these appears to have been of the spiked type. Instead, among the seventeen  brazier fragments are pieces from a large bat effigy brazier, a biconical one,  and a fancy bowl-type brazier with appliqué decoration (Fig. 7.16). The bat effigy brazier is represented by ten fragments, including a lower  jaw with fangs and tongue, portion of an upper jaw with a fang, part of an  eye, a complete nose, a claw, most of a wide collar or “bib,” and a piece of  the rim to which the effigy was attached (Fig. 7.17a). The rim of this gray  ceramic brazier measures approximately 30 cm in diameter. It is decorated  with two parallel appliqué strips modeled to resemble a rope and a modeled  appliqué “bow” or “clasp” that joins the two ends of the rope in a semblance  of binding them together. The bat had a fancy wide collar or “bib” around  his neck. The collar was decorated along its edge by two parallel appliqué  strips modeled to resemble a rope, like that on the rim. The fringe beneath  the “rope” was decorated with incised stepped lines like fringes of cloaks or  blouses. Caso and Bernal (1952:88–91) illustrate a number of bat effigy bra- ziers with similar attributes, although none comes from Monte Albán. The  Tomb 6 bat effigy brazier probably stood more than 70 cm high. The fancy bowl-type brazier is represented by five fragments (Fig. 7.17b).

This  brazier was unusual because it was orange instead of gray. It seems probable  that this fancy orange brazier was associated with the offering that included  the orange jaguar effigy vessel, jaguar claw vessel, and the Pitao Cozobi  urn. A similar, but smaller, fancy bowl-type brazier was found in Tomb 2  in Mound 190 at Lambityeco (Paddock, Mogor, and Lind 1968:18, fig. 24).  Caso and Bernal (1952:108) illustrate two fancy bowl-type braziers (neither  of which comes from Monte Albán) that have attributes similar to the one  just described. The biconical brazier, a burnished brown ceramic vessel, is represented  by two fragments (Fig. 7.17c). It probably measured about 20 cm high and  had a rim diameter of approximately 18 cm. A wide appliqué band with a  narrow appliqué strip atop it encircles the center of the brazier. This ves- sel had a smudged interior presumably from the incense burned within it. Four bowls were assembled from sherds screened from the fill in front  of Tomb 6. Three were gray ceramic G-35 bowls and one was a brown  K-14 bowl (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:385). K-14 bowls are brown in  color and otherwise identical to the G-35 bowls (Table 7.6). A miniature subhemispherical bowl was reconstructed from numer- ous small sherds screened from the fill in front of Tomb 6 (Fig. 7.22a). The  vessel is well-burnished and manifests a light gray interior and a dark-gray  exterior body. It had a rim diameter of 11 cm and a height of 4 cm. The  bowl was broken and had several pieces missing. Similar bowls have been  found in two different tombs at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta  1967:403, fig. 330i). A burnished gray ceramic hemispherical bowl was located in the fill  in front of Tomb 6. It was less than half complete. It had a rim diameter  of 20 cm and a height of 16 cm (Fig. 7.22b). Similar hemispherical vessels,  </page> <page sequence="41"> T o m b  6  —  211 a b 7.18. Flanged-neck tecomates from Lambityeco (photo of reconstructed tecomate courtesy  of Marcus Winter) classified as G-3 bowls, occur in both mortuary and nonmortuary contexts  at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:383, table XVI; 397). The  bowls probably functioned as serving vessels for beverages. Two large rim sherds, one from a large olla and the other from a large  f langed-neck tecomate, occur in the fill in front of Tomb 6. The olla rim  sherd came from a large gray vessel with a rim diameter of 32 cm. Large  gray ollas are fairly common in tomb and burial offerings at Monte Albán  (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:427). The tecomate rim sherd came from a large yellow vessel with a rim  diameter of 32 cm (Fig. 7.18a). A f lange occurs just below the rim and  remnants of strap handles with drilled perforations on either side are vis- ible. It appears that these perforations were made to insert a cord handle  when the ceramic handle broke. No similar tecomates have been found  in tombs or burials at Monte Albán. At Lambityeco, however, a complete  large f langed-neck tecomate with strap handles and a lid was found in front  </page> <page sequence="42"> 212 —  T o m b  6 7.19. Shell, bone, stone, and bark ornaments from Tomb 6 of Tomb 11 in Mound 185 just north of Mound 195 (Fig. 7.18b) (Winter,  personal communication, 1998; Winter, Deraga, and Fernández 1979). Two small obsidian blades were found in the fill in front of the tomb.  Both were of black obsidian and probably came from the Altotonga source  in Veracruz. One measured 3.4 cm long, 6 mm wide, and 2 mm thick; the  other measured 3.7 cm long, 8 mm wide, and 2 mm thick. They may have  been used in self-sacrificial bloodletting rituals performed in front of the  tomb. Three shell ornaments were found in the fill and may represent offer- ings that were originally with the individuals buried in the antechamber  or main chamber. These include a tubular bead, a disk, and a pendant (Fig.  7.19a; no photograph of the pendant is available). The tubular bead is 2.1  cm long, 6 mm wide, and 3 mm thick. It has a groove the length of its un- derside that indicates it was broken in half. The shell is pink and pitted on  its underside and chalky white on its topside. This bead may have been part  of a necklace or bracelet. The disk was screened from the upper layers of  the fill in front of the tomb façade. It is in the form of a ring (too small and  too fragile to have served as any kind of finger ring) with a series of notches  around it. Its maximum diameter is 1.4 cm and inner diameter 9 mm, and  it is 1 mm thick. Three other notched shell rings or disks have been found  at Lambityeco but none is from a mortuary context. The pendant (3.3 cm  long, 1.9 cm wide, and 2 mm thick) has a pointed upper end that is notched  on either side but has no hole drilled through it. Its lower end was cut off  horizontally. A similar shell pendant was found in Tomb 11 at Lambityeco  (Winter, personal communication, 1998). Most of the objects screened from the fill in front of the façade of  Tomb 6 almost certainly pertained to displaced offerings placed below the  lintel area or in front of the door. With the repeated reopenings of the  tomb, these offerings were broken and scattered throughout the fill. A few  </page> <page sequence="43"> T o m b  6  —  213 objects, such as the shell ornaments, may have been displaced from offer- ings originally placed with the individuals buried in the antechamber or  main chamber of the tomb. the antechambeR OffeRIng A total of 103 objects plus the remains of two immature dogs and eight  birds occur in the antechamber offering. Even if the fifty-eight spindle  whorls that were strung together and left in the north niche are consid- ered a single object, instead of separate objects, the total number of objects  placed in the antechamber is still more than double that of any other of- fering context in the tomb. Furthermore, there are twenty-one different  types of objects in the antechamber, which is nearly double the number of  different types of objects in any other offering context in the tomb. Clearly,  the quantity and the variety of objects placed in the antechamber make it  the principal and most complex locus of offerings in the tomb. There is little patterning evident in the distribution of objects within  the antechamber. Most of the objects are clustered at the far east end and  any purposeful arrangements that might have occurred appear, for the  most part, to have been greatly disturbed and displaced during the repeated  openings of the tomb (Fig. 7.5). There are nine G-35 and three K-14 bowls in the antechamber and at  least five of these appear to have been purposefully arranged as part of the  last offering (Fig. 7.13, Table 7.7). Two small bowls, a G-35 and K-14 (#11  and #12 in Fig. 7.13), occur in an upright position on the antechamber  f loor on either side of the north niche, and two other G-35 bowls (#13  and #14) also occur in an upright position on the f loor on either side of  the south niche—although it appears that one (#13) was moved partially  out of position. A small K-14 bowl (#15) was in an upright position in the  south niche. Six additional G-35 bowls and a K-14 bowl occur in the antechamber  offering and all are located near the east end where considerable distur- bance is evident. Four of these are broken and incomplete and most likely  served as previous offerings. Two others were broken but complete. One of  these (#16 in Fig. 7.13) was inverted and rested directly on the antechamber  f loor. The other (#18) was upright and contained traces of red pigment  on its interior. This bowl was probably reused from a previous offering as  a container for red paint. The paint may have been used to decorate the  panels on the tomb façade or to paint the skull of the individual who was  buried in the antechamber. Finally, one large G-35 bowl had its sherds  scattered between the antechamber and main chamber (#22 in Fig. 7.13). </page> <page sequence="44"> 214 —  T o m b  6 table 7.7.

Four ladle censers occur in the antechamber offering (Table 7.8). Two  of them were broken. One of these was in the center of the antechamber  near the f loor and the other was located in the doorway between the an- techamber and main chamber (Fig. 7.5). The two complete ladle censers  were intact. One was on the antechamber f loor just inside and directly  north of the tomb entrance. The other was situated near the center of the  eastern end of the antechamber in front of the door to the main chamber.  It rested above some broken vessels and other offerings and below some of  the rubble from the roof of the main chamber. Its location and unbroken  condition demonstrate that it was part of the last offering before the hole  was dug through the tomb roof to place the final burial. This ladle censer  contained traces of copal resin and pieces of carbonized wood and corncobs  that were submitted for radiocarbon analysis and yielded a calibrated date  </page> <page sequence="45"> T o m b  6  —  215 table 7.8.

No  complete primary corresponding to his burial was found beneath the rub- ble from the roof; therefore, his bones had been removed before her burial. The spiked brazier in the antechamber offering is in the form of a jar  with two loop handles modeled to look like rope. It is a gray ceramic vessel  coated with a lime whitewash very similar to, only smaller than, the spiked  jar in the door offering (Fig. 7.15c); its rim diameter measured 8.4 cm and it  was 7.5 cm tall. Unlike the spiked jar in the door offering, which had large  vents cut in its walls, this brazier had small holes poked through its walls in  the areas between the spikes. The brazier was complete and intact. Braziers  are assumed to have been vessels in which incense was burned but this one  showed no evidence of having been used. One unburnished gray ceramic vessel in the form of a patojo was found  in the antechamber offering (Fig. 7.20a). The vessel is 21 cm long and has  a rim diameter of 11.1 cm and a height of 11.7 cm. Present-day Mixes  use patojos to cook beans (Paddock, personal communication, 1983). The  Tomb 6 patojo is smudged from cooking fires on its exterior lower half  and has traces of lime on its interior from the water boiled within it. Two  nubbin handles located on opposite sides of the vessel probably facilitated  its removal from the cooking fire with the sides of the hands when hot.  Remnants of a loop handle that had extended from the rim to the toe of the  patojo were visible but the handle was broken and missing. At Monte Albán, patojos are apparently scarce and occur in tomb and  burial offerings of only the Pe (Monte Albán I) and Chila (Monte Albán  V) phases (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:460). In the Tlacolula arm of the  valley, however, a patojo was found in a Nisa phase (Monte Albán II) tomb  offering at the site of Brawbehl and, of course, the Tomb 6 patojo dates to  the Xoo phase. In addition, patojos have been found in Chila phase deposits  </page> <page sequence="46"> 216 —  T o m b  6 at Macuilxóchitl (Markens, Winter, and Martínez 2008:206). Apart from  the Tomb 6 example, no other patojo has been found in a tomb or burial  offering at Lambityeco. A single, well-burnished gray ceramic tecomate, with a conical bowl- like lid occurs in the antechamber offering. The vessel has a rim diameter  of 15.5 cm and a height of 16.6 cm. Three small vertically placed handles  occur on the body. A well-burnished, black-slipped ceramic lid, 20.3 cm  in diameter and 8.5 cm high, covered the top of the tecomate. The lid also  manifested three vertically placed handles. Similar tecomates, but without  handles and lids, have been found on occasion in tomb and burial offer- ings at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:429, 430, fig. 364).  The tecomate was located directly on the f loor in the northeast corner of  the antechamber with the lid in place on top of it (Fig. 7.5). Both were  complete and intact. In Chapter 3, this tecomate with a lid was discussed  and interpreted as a spinning kit, used to spin cotton fibers into thread  (see Fig. 3.6b). The spinning kit was probably placed as an offering for one  of the females buried in the tomb. The tecomate had within it two small  manos, three spindle whorls, one double cup, and a small Fine Orange  pitcher. The sixty-two spindle whorls (bigus in modern Mitla Zapotec), repre- sent the most numerous object of any single type in the Tomb 6 offering.  The spindle whorls are reddish-brown (K-14 ware) in color and have small  round holes near their centers. All were complete and intact and all were  found in the antechamber. Fifty-eight spindle whorls were found together  like beads on a necklace from which the string has disintegrated. They  were located in the north niche and probably served as an offering for one  of the females buried in Tomb 6. They ranged between 3.4 cm and 4.1 cm  in diameter and were from 3 mm to 4 mm thick. Four other spindle whorls were found separate from the above fifty- eight. Three of these were inside the tecomate with the lid discussed above.  Their diameters measured 3.1 cm, 3.5 cm, and 3.7 cm and all were 3 mm  thick. The fourth spindle whorl was found directly on the antechamber  f loor and measured 3.6 cm in diameter and was 3 mm thick. Whether all  of these spindle whorls were intended as an offering for a single female or  constituted parts of separate offerings for more than one of the females  buried in Tomb 6 is uncertain. In Chapter 3, these spindle whorls were  illustrated and discussed as implements for spinning cotton (see Fig. 3.6a). Two stone manos were found in the antechamber offering located in- side the tecomate with a lid. Both were complete and intact and manifested  parallel scratch marks on their surfaces, which showed that they had been  used (see Fig. 3.6b). One of the manos is oblong in shape and has a triangu- </page> <page sequence="47"> T o m b  6  —  217 lar cross-section. It was made of a fine-grain gray rock, probably basalt. All  three of its surfaces were very smooth and two showed striations, indicating  use in a back-and-forth rubbing motion. Both of these surfaces manifested  traces of red pigment. This mano measured 12.2 cm long, 6 cm wide, and  5.9 cm thick. The second mano is oval in shape and has a somewhat ellipti- cal cross-section. It measured 10.1 cm long, 7.6 cm wide, and 5.7 cm thick  and was made from a whitish coarse-grain rock, probably granite. Because  of its shape it had only two grinding surfaces. One of these was smooth and  showed striations, indicating use in a back-and-forth rubbing motion. This  surface had traces of red pigment on it. The other surface was rough and  heavily pitted and lacked traces of any pigment. At Lambityeco, manos occur in offerings in elaborate tombs, simple  tombs, and plain graves. Manos functioned as grinding stones, somewhat  like rolling pins, and served principally to grind corn into meal but also to  grind chocolate. The Tomb 6 manos show only slight wear and had obvi- ously been used to grind red pigment, probably hematite. The red pigment  may have been used to dye threads or to paint parts of the tomb, bones,  or other objects. Therefore, the manos, like the spindle whorls, may have  formed part of the spinning kit contained within the tecomate with a lid  or simply left in the tecomate after having been used to grind hematite for  the red paint used in the tomb. In her study of manos from excavations at Lambityeco, Victoria Bach  (1971) demonstrated that a difference exists between manos from mortuary  offerings and those found in middens or other household contexts. The  household manos were all heavily worn and broken following daily use  in Zapotec kitchens and had been discarded in middens. Those in mortu- ary offerings were in good condition—unbroken and showing little signs  of wear. No study of the manos from tomb and burial offerings at Monte  Albán has been published. A single double cup was found in the antechamber offering. It is a gray  ceramic vessel but was coated with a lime whitewash. Both of the cups  forming the double cup were virtually the same size—one was 9.3 cm high  and the other 9.2 cm high. Although this double cup was found inside the  tecomate with a lid (see Fig. 3.6b), it does not appear to be associated with  the spinning kit, as mentioned in Chapter 3, and may have been picked up  and placed in the tecomate following one of the many reopenings of the  tomb. Like the double cup in the lintel offering, the function of the ex- ample in the antechamber offering is unknown, although it may have been  used for mixing liquids or powders. Two vessels, one with a lid, constitute the three pieces of Fine Orange  from the antechamber offering (Fig. 7.20b). One vessel is a small pitcher  </page> <page sequence="48"> 7.20. Patojo, Fine Orange vessels, and bone implements from Tomb 6 </page> <page sequence="49"> T o m b  6  —  219 with a maximum diameter of 6.8 cm and a height of 9.1 cm. Similar Fine  Orange pitchers occur at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:383,  table XVI). No macroscopic traces of contents were found within the  Tomb 6 pitcher. The pitcher was complete and intact. The vessel with the lid is in the form of a small goblet (Fig. 7.20b). This  vessel has a rim diameter of 4 cm and is 5 cm high. Two tiny holes 3 mm  in diameter occur just below the rim on opposite sides of the vessel. The  lid, which fits over the mouth of the goblet, is in the form of a circular cap  5.7 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm tall. Two tiny holes 2 mm in diameter oc- cur on opposite sides of the top of the lid. The presence of the holes in the  lid and in the goblet suggests that both parts could be securely fastened by  means of a string. A virtually identical goblet and lid, but of G-7, or black-slipped, ware  and not Fine Orange, was found in Tomb 92 at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal,  and Acosta 1967:438, fig. 372). Several other “goblets” with lids but without  pedestal supports occur in tomb offerings at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal,  and Acosta 1967:418) and one example is Fine Orange (Caso, Bernal, and  Acosta 1967:430, fig. 364d). The function of these receptacles with lids is  unknown. The Tomb 6 goblet lacked macroscopic traces of any contents.  The goblet was intact, although a small fragment was broken from its ped- estal base and missing from the vicinity of the tomb. The tiny pitcher and the tiny goblet with a lid appear to have formed  a set that served as an offering for one of the individuals buried in Tomb 6.  The pitcher was located inside the tecomate with a lid, and the goblet and  lid were situated in the north niche with the string of fifty-eight spindle  whorls wrapped around them (Fig. 7.5). Although intact, all three pieces  were located in places that would inhibit accidental breakage. This, com- bined with the fact that a piece was broken and missing from the goblet,  suggests that these Fine Orange vessels had been placed with an earlier,  instead of the last, offering. Four bone battens were found in the antechamber offering (Fig. 3.6c).  Three of the battens were large and made from deer tibiae split length- wise and cut and rounded or squared off at the distal ends. All three have  the proximal ends intact and were made from the posterior halves of left  tibiae—one of these from an immature deer. All three also had traces of  red paint near their proximal ends. One measured 25.5 cm long and was  2.2 cm wide and 9 mm thick at the small end. Its end was squared. The  second measured 24.6 cm long and was 1.5 cm wide and 1 cm thick at the  small end. Its end was rounded. The third measured 21.8 cm long and was  2 cm wide and 1.1 cm thick at the small end. Its end was concave. All three  occur directly on the antechamber f loor—two near one another and the  </page> <page sequence="50"> 220 —  T o m b  6 third a short distance away. In Chapter 3, these battens were discussed and  interpreted as weaving implements. The fourth bone “batten” was similar in form to the above three but  was very small (Fig. 7.20c). It measured only 3.8 cm long and was 8 mm  wide and 4 mm thick at the small end. Its end was squared. It was broken  but complete and the type of animal bone and anatomical element from  which it was made is unknown. Three bone pins or awls were clustered together above the f loor of  the antechamber (Fig. 7.20c). The type of animal bone from which they  were made is not known. Each is rounded on its thick end and narrows to  a point at its thin end. All have more or less round cross-sections. One is  8.2 cm long and 3 mm thick. The second is 9 cm long and 4 mm thick, and  the third is 7.4 cm long and 4 mm thick. All are heavily pitted near their  pointed ends as if they had been chewed, or perhaps this texture merely  ref lects the trabecular tissue4 of the bones used to make these objects. In their size, shape, and pitted ends, the small awls or pins appear re- markably similar to the small awls used by the Dugum Dani (illustrated in  Robert Gardner’s film Dead Birds) to weave funerary bands. In the process  of weaving these bands, the Dani are constantly sticking the awls between  their teeth to free their hands so that they can pull the cord through the  loops they have made with the awls. The ones from Tomb 6 may have  served a similar function, and been used in a similar manner, or they may  have served to weave baskets. A single obsidian blade occurred in the antechamber offering. It was  a whole blade, complete and intact, with a ground striking platform. It  measured 9.3 cm long, 1.2 cm wide, and 3 mm thick. The whole blade was  unmodified and showed no evidence of use retouch, which indicates that  it was a “new” and unused item when placed in the tomb as an offering.  In Zapotec daily life, unmodified blades functioned as cutting implements.  Similar blades are found in offerings in elaborate tombs, simple tombs,  and plain graves at Lambityeco. The Tomb 6 blade was black and probably  came from the Altotonga source in Veracruz. An object that had been coated with a veneer of green paint was found  in the antechamber offering near the f loor. Although only the green paint- ed veneer was preserved for a length of 21.5 cm and a width of 3 cm, it  appears that it had once coated a wooden object. This object may have been  a blowgun. Parsons (1936:48–49) mentions that the Zapotecs of Mitla and  Huilá used angular, not round, green painted blowguns and clay pellets to  hunt birds and rabbits. She states that the blowguns were about eight feet  long and that the mouth end into which the clay pellet was placed narrowed  down to an inch in diameter. It is possible, then, that this was the remnants  </page> <page sequence="51"> T o m b  6  —  221 of a blowgun that had been placed in the antechamber as an offering for  one of the males. Reinforcing this interpretation is a solid ceramic ball or  sphere 4 cm in diameter that was located in the north niche of the ante- chamber. It was reddish-brown in color, like the spindle whorls, and was  complete and intact. It most likely served as a pellet for a blowgun. Tiny  ceramic balls or pellets have also been found in tomb offerings at Monte  Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:437, 440, fig. 374). Ceramic pellets  occur in offerings in both elaborate and simple tombs at Lambityeco, but  none has been found in offerings in plain graves. A single greenstone bead, 1.4 cm in diameter and 9 mm thick, was  found in the antechamber offering (Fig. 7.19a). Greenstone beads occur in  offerings in elaborate and simple tombs as well as plain graves at both Lam- bi tyeco and Monte Albán. The widespread Mesoamerican custom of placing  a greenstone bead in the mouth of the deceased does not appear to have been  followed at Lambityeco, because no primary burials have been found to have  had greenstone beads placed in their mouths. However, given the disturbed  nature of tomb burials, it is possible that some individuals, particularly in  elite tombs, were interred with a greenstone bead in the mouth. An earring made from a single large canine tooth, probably from a jag- uar or mountain lion, occurred on the antechamber f loor near the green- stone bead (Fig. 7.19b). The earring was made by splitting the canine lon- gitudinally—one half forming this earring was found in the antechamber  and the other half came from the main chamber. Both earrings were 5.7  cm long, 1.3 cm wide, and 1 cm thick. The pointed end of the canine  formed the lower end of the earring and two holes 2 mm in diameter were  drilled horizontally, perforating the upper (root) end of the tooth for sus- pension. The main chamber example had its upper end partially broken  near the top of the holes. The jaguar tooth earring pendants are like those  rendered in the portrait head of Lord 1 Lachi that decorates the façade of  Tomb 6. These were most likely the earrings he was wearing when he was  buried in the main chamber of Tomb 6. The two earrings probably became  scattered between the main chamber and antechamber when his bones  were removed from the tomb. A single bracelet that may have been made from bark cloth was found  in the north niche of the antechamber (Fig. 7.19b). It was squashed nearly  f lat and measured 5.4 cm long, 2.4 cm wide, and 4 mm thick. The interior  edges on both sides of the bracelet are notched. If it was a bracelet, it either  had not been worn by one of the individuals buried in the tomb or was  removed from their bones and placed in the north niche. A single hollow bone tube was found in the north niche of the ante- chamber. It measures 7.6 cm long and is 8 mm in diameter. It is broken at  </page> <page sequence="52"> 222 —  T o m b  6 both ends, which makes it impossible to determine if the ends had been  cut purposefully to shape it into a small hollow tube. Perhaps the tube was  open on one end and closed on the other, forming a case for the bone awls  or pins found in the antechamber. Most of the remains of two immature dogs occur in the antecham- ber. The immature dogs had their remains scattered outside the tomb in  the area of the door offering, indicating that they had formed part of an  earlier offering in the antechamber. Canseco (1580:145, 149) reports that  Zapotecs sacrificed dogs to ancestral coqui, and Parsons (1936:152) cites  Mitla Zapotecs, who refer to dogs who help them cross a big river when  they die. At Lambityeco, dogs occur as offerings associated with individu- als buried in elaborate tombs, simple tombs, and plain graves (Urcid 1983;  Zárate 1992). The remains of at least eight small birds occur in the tomb; two in the  south niche of the antechamber and six scattered between the antechamber  and main chamber. One bird skull was found together with some of the  remains of the immature dogs in the area of the door offering outside the  tomb. It appears that originally all the birds were in the antechamber and  some of their remains were displaced to the main chamber and outside the  tomb door. Although the bird remains have not been identified yet, two varieties  are represented. Sacrificial offerings of birds were quite common at the  time of the Conquest. Zapotecs from Mitla and Tlacolula were reported to  have sacrificed quail, turkeys, and other birds (Canseco 1580:149). Because  the birds in Tomb 6 are small (none is a turkey), it is possible that they  are the remains of quail (gidgish in modern Mitla Zapotec) and mitreños  (bigin in modern Mitla Zapotec)—small crested birds—both of which oc- cur in the area and probably served as sacrificial offerings in Prehispanic  times (Parsons 1936:495, 553). Birds occur as offerings in elaborate tombs  at Lambityeco. the maIn chambeR OffeRIng Few artifacts, in comparison with the antechamber, were placed in the  main chamber. Only twenty-one objects, mostly serving vessels, were  left as offerings (Fig. 7.5). The last burial (68-22) placed in the main  chamber, that of Lady 10 Naa, did not have her body passed through  the tomb door and antechamber. Instead, she was buried directly in the  main chamber by way of a hole dug through the altar and Tomb 5 (Fig.  7.1). The hole collapsed the roof of the main chamber, which was made  of adobes arranged to form a vault. These adobes and the f ill above them  </page> <page sequence="53"> T o m b  6  —  223 fell onto the main chamber f loor and some spilled out into the east end  of the antechamber. Lady 10 Naa was buried directly on top of the rubble  formed by the collapsed roof and fill. A mat shroud was placed over her  body and two G-35 bowls, one inside the other, were placed in an up- right position near her right elbow. These two G-35 bowls and the mat  shroud appear to have been the only offerings accompanying her remains  (Fig. 7.3). The remaining offerings in the main chamber were mixed in with  the rubble and fill from the collapsed roof or near the main chamber f loor  beneath the fill. Most of the bones of the individuals buried in the main  chamber before her had been partially removed some time prior to the  placement of her body. Most of the earlier offerings were left mixed with  the rubble from the collapsed roof and fill, and five G-35 bowls appear to  have been removed from the main chamber and placed in what was left of  Tomb 5 coincident with her burial (see Figs. 5.6 and 5.7; Table 5.2). Apart from the two G-35 bowls associated with Lady 10 Naa, four  others occur in the main chamber offering. One was assembled from sherds  scattered throughout the rubble from the collapsed roof and therefore was  not located three-dimensionally. Three G-35 bowls, placed upright one  inside another (#23, #24, and #25 in Fig. 7.13) and located in the south- west corner of the main chamber near the f loor, were covered by rubble  from the collapsed roof (Fig. 7.21b). One of these is a small G-35 bowl  (#23) and the other two are large (#24 and #25). All of these G-35 bowls  were broken and certainly formed offerings for one or more of the earlier  burials in the main chamber (Fig. 7.21a). No macroscopic contents were  found in any of the G-35 bowls (Table 7.9). Five miniature bowls occur in the main chamber offering (Fig. 7.22a,  Table 7.10). Three of these are conical cups. All are gray and unburnish- ed. Similar miniature conical cups occur in tomb and burial offerings at  Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:396, fig. 325a; 397). Two  other miniatures are G-35 bowls. One is burnished and lacks supports, and  the other is also burnished but had solid tripod supports that were broken  and missing. A total of 149 Xoo phase tripod-supported miniature G-35  bowls, but only two without supports, occurs in offerings (including tomb  and burial offerings) at Monte Albán (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:400,  401, fig. 330a). The function of these miniatures is unknown, although  they may have served as receptacles for condiments. A single hemispherical bowl, very similar to one found in the fill in  front of the tomb, was found in the main chamber offering (Fig. 7.22b). It  was burnished and had a rim diameter of 16 cm and a height of 11 cm. The  bowl, although broken and missing a piece, was nearly complete. The bowl  </page> <page sequence="54"> 7.21.

A single bone batten was found in the main chamber. It was virtually  identical to the three large bone battens from the antechamber (see Fig.  3.6c). It measured 21.3 cm long and was 2 cm wide at the base and 8 mm  thick. Its end was slightly concave. Like the battens in the antechamber,  this one was made from a deer tibia split lengthwise and cut off at the distal  end. The proximal end of this batten is cut, precluding identification of the  side of the deer tibia from which it was manufactured. However, like the  others, its proximal end contained traces of red paint. </page> <page sequence="56"> 226 —  T o m b  6 7.22. Miniature and hemispherical bowls from Tomb 6 A large bone pin was also left in the main chamber offering (Fig. 7.20c).  Unlike the much smaller bone awls or pins from the antechamber, this one  measures 17.7 cm long and has an elliptical cross-section that is 9 mm wide  and 3 mm thick. Although large bone pins occur in other elaborate tombs  at Lambityeco, their function is unknown. It is possible that the pin served  as a weaving implement or perhaps to secure a fancy headdress or coiffure  like a hat pin. </page> <page sequence="57"> T o m b  6  —  227 A single distal phalanx from a deer was uncovered in the main cham- ber. It measured 2.6 cm long and, because of its pointed configuration, may  have been used as an awl (Fig. 7.20c). A triangular-shaped shell pendant was found in the main chamber  offering (Fig. 7.19a). It is 2.5 cm long, l cm wide at the base, and 4 mm  thick. Its upper (pointed) end has a hole drilled through it for suspension.  The hole measures 4 mm in diameter on one side, narrowing to 2 mm in  diameter on the opposite side. The lower half of the pendant was cut off di- agonally. Its color is reddish-brown on one side and off-white on the other. A bone pendant found in the main chamber was assembled from frag- ments screened from the rubble layer (Fig. 7.19b). The pendant was made  from a piece of bone cut from a large mammal. It is highly polished and  rounded at its upper part where a 2 mm hole was drilled through it for  suspension. The pendant measures 1.3 cm wide and 3 mm thick and has a  length (as far as its broken end) of 3.2 cm. Part of the skeletal remains of a mature dog was found in situ on the  f loor of the main chamber. However, some of its remains were also found  in the antechamber and a few of its bones were outside Tomb 6 on top of  the altar through which the hole had been dug to gain access to the main  chamber. Whether the dog was sacrificed in the main chamber to accom- pany his master to the hereafter or had been sacrificed before putting it into  the main chamber is unknown. patteRnS In the tOmb 6 OffeRIngS Despite considerable disturbance, patterns are evident in the offerings asso- ciated with Tomb 6. Both earlier and later lintel offerings contain all of the  urns, effigy figures, and bipod effigy vases as is attested by their presence in  and around the vicinity of the lintel and by the final arrangement in front  of the portrait heads that decorate the façade above the lintel. No urns,  urn fragments, effigy figures (with the possible exception of the bat effigy  brazier in the door offering), or bipod effigy vases were found within the  door, antechamber, or main chamber offerings. Even a piece of the carved  stone tablet was found in the area of the lintel, suggesting that it may have  formed part of a lintel offering. The function of these urns and effigy figures has been debated. Caso  and Bernal (1952) considered them to embody Zapotec deities. Marcus  (1983) interpreted them as deceased ancestors impersonating supernatural  forces. Sellen has taken a middle ground between these positions, suggest- ing that they represent noble ancestors impersonating deities in various  ritual activities and that “these images accompanied the impersonator to  </page> <page sequence="58"> 228 —  T o m b  6 his or her grave, where perhaps they continued to play a ritual role in the  afterlife” (Sellen 2002:17). We posit, following Sellen, that the Cociyo urn from the lintel in  Tomb 6 represents an ancestral impersonator of the Zapotec deity of rain  and lightning. Three of the bipod effigy vases depict Cociyo and the fourth  has a human face with a Glyph C in the headdress that relates to Cociyo.  Caso and Bernal (1952:40) noted that most bipod effigy vases are associ- ated with the rain god. The large plaster busts of Cociyo decorating a small  room in Mound 190 at Lambityeco (see Fig. 5.3) show Cociyo pouring  water from similar vases (Lind and Urcid 1983:84, fig. 12b). The bipod  effigy vases, then, were clearly ritual items associated with the rain deity  and were certainly used in rituals aimed at petitioning rain and hence good  maize crops. The latter theme is also evident in the two nearly identical  human effigy figures with renditions of mature and budding maize in  their headdresses. Originally, these two effigies and the incomplete one  similar to them found in the fill (Fig. 7.9d) may have formed a set of five,  the smaller ones occupying the four quadrants of the world and the larger  one representing Lord 1 Lachi as the axis mundi. Such a tableau would  have construed the ruler as overseer of the four corners in rituals involving  the planting, growth, and harvesting of maize. Such rituals were probably  conducted by Lord 1 Lachi during his lifetime. A similar tableau may have been formed by the box and lid urn, with  the representation of one of the previous rulers embodying Pitao Cozobi  placed in the center and four now missing box and lid urns of Cociyo in  the four corners. This other tableau may have been deployed in rituals re- lated to rainmaking that were enacted by the household heads during their  lifetimes. The bearded male effigy figure may also represent Lord 1 Lachi in yet  another ritual role. Given the long robe that covers him and the sacrificial  knife hanging from a necklace around his neck, it is possible that this de- picts him in his role as a sacrificer. The carved tablet depicts Lady 10 Naa  addressing the highly venerated apical ancestor of the noble lineage, Lord  2 Alligator, perhaps making an important legitimatizing claim upon the  death of her husband. Finally, the jaguar effigy vessel is a symbol of the  noble status of those venerated ancestors buried in the tomb. Many of the objects in the door offering ref lect rituals performed be- fore and during the opening or following the closing of the door to the  tomb. The seven ladle censers are more or less symmetrically arranged  in front of the north and south door jambs, and the two spiked braziers  together with the three braziers (including the bat effigy brazier) from  displaced offerings testify to a great deal of activity involving the ritual  </page> <page sequence="59"> T o m b  6  —  229 burning of incense. Likewise, the two obsidian awls (and two additional  obsidian blades found in the fill) most likely relate to bloodletting rituals in  front of the tomb door to invoke the ancestors. Apart from rituals involving bloodletting and incense burning, the  objects in the door offering also imply offerings associated with food. Ten  small G-35 bowls, which most likely functioned as food-serving dishes,  were purposefully arranged on either side of the door and an additional  four bowls were recovered from the fill. Likewise, a hemispherical bowl  from the fill probably functioned as a beverage container. Remnants of two  large storage vessels found in the fill, an olla and tecomate, may have served  as water and/or food storage containers. The door offering, then, appears to have been the principal locus of  ritual incense burning and bloodletting preparatory to opening the tomb  door and perhaps following the closing of the door. It was also the locus  for placing offerings of food and drink in serving and storage vessels—an  activity that took place as a last rite subsequent to closing the tomb door. Despite the quantity and diversity of objects left in the antechamber,  certain patterns are evident. The twelve G-35 and K-14 bowls indicate that  the antechamber, even more than the door, was a locus for offerings of  food. Besides food-serving bowls, the antechamber offering included four  ladle censers and a spiked brazier that are artifacts related to the burning  of incense. The small number of incense burners in comparison with the  door offering suggests that these incense burners were carried into the an- techamber by the few people allowed in there and were left following their  use in ritually purifying the area. The remains of two immature dogs and eight birds were left in the  antechamber. It is possible that they were sacrificed in front of the tomb  door and their remains deposited inside. The dogs were most likely immo- lated in accordance with a pan-Mesoamerican belief that they would aid  their masters in the journey to the hereafter. Bird sacrifice was a common  Zapotec ritual for the invocation of ancestors at the time of the Conquest  and clearly formed part of elite Zapotec rituals during the Xoo phase, as  further evidenced by their representation in several carved monuments. Most, nearly 75 percent, of the objects in the antechamber appear to be  personal items or special items intended as offerings for specific individuals  buried in the tomb. Artifacts corresponding to spinning, weaving, food  preparation, hunting, and personal adornments occur in the antechamber  offering. The personal adornments are scarce and include a jaguar tooth  earring (whose counterpart was found in the main chamber), a bark-cloth  bracelet, and a greenstone bead. Two objects, a possible blowgun and ce- ramic pellet, most likely relate to hunting and were probably placed in the  </page> <page sequence="60"> 230 —  T o m b  6 tomb as an offering for one of the males. One item, a patojo, is associated  with food preparation and most likely formed an offering for one of the  females. Items associated with spinning are the most common. These include  sixty-two spindle whorls, of which fifty-eight were found strung together  and left in the north niche, and the spinning kit formed by the tecomate  with a lid, which also contained three spindle whorls. The other spindle  whorl was found on the antechamber f loor. These items probably formed  offerings for the females buried in the tomb. Two manos were also found  in the tecomate with a lid and may have been used to grind pigments to  produce dyes. However, these may not have been offerings at all but simply  manos left in the tomb after grinding pigment for paint or powder either to  paint the tomb or to sprinkle on the remains of the deceased. The one small and three large bone battens found in the antechamber  were weaving implements. Although spinning is a female activity, there  is no reason to assume weaving is female associated. Today, Zapotec men  from Teotitlán del Valle, Santa Ana del Valle, and Mitla are the weavers,  but this may result from the introduction of mechanized wooden looms  after the Conquest; women appear to have been the weavers before the  Conquest. The three bone awls or pins were also most likely weaving im- plements; none had an eye for sewing. They may have been used to weave  baskets but their specific gender association is uncertain. The small Fine Orange pitcher and tiny Fine Orange goblet with a lid  appear to have formed a matched set. These exceptionally fine pieces must  have been a prized possession or offerings for one of the individuals buried  in the tomb. The single complete and intact obsidian blade found on the  antechamber f loor was new and unused and may have been intended as a  cutting implement or a blade to be used in ritual bloodletting in the here- after. Finally, the double cup found inside the tecomate with a lid, like the  double cup in the lintel offering, is of uncertain function. The small size  and double nature of these cups suggest that they may have been used to  mix liquids or powders. The main chamber from the time of its construction as part of Structure  4 was the mortuary facility set apart to house the mortal remains. However,  with the exception of the last interment, most of the bones of earlier burials  in the main chamber had been removed. Few objects were left as offerings  and most of those that were appear to have been limited to a few carefully  arranged serving vessels and in one case at least a sacrificed dog placed next  to its master. The food-serving bowls include two large and four small  G-35 bowls; in addition, the four small and one large G-35 bowl found in  Tomb 5 should be included because they were most likely removed from  </page> <page sequence="61"> T o m b  6  —  231 the main chamber when the hole was dug to place the last burial. The five  miniature bowls probably served as containers for condiments, although  the three conical ones may have been used for beverages. The hemispheri- cal bowl was likely a container for beverages. The remaining objects in the main chamber appear to have been ob- jects with which the bodies were attired for burial. These include the jag- uar tooth earrings (of which one was found in the antechamber) that were  probably worn by Lord 1 Lachi. In addition, the shell and bone pendants  were most likely worn by individuals buried in the main chamber, and it is  possible that the tubular shell bead and pendant sifted from in front of the  tomb had been displaced from the main chamber along with the shell disk  during one of the reopenings of the tomb. The long bone pin (if it was not  a weaving implement) may have been used to secure a fancy headdress or  functioned as a hairpin for an elaborate coiffure. The bone batten and awl made from a deer phalanx originally may  have been left as offerings in the main chamber or may have been displaced  from the antechamber during one of the reopenings of the tomb. The bone  batten is almost identical to three other bone battens in the antechamber  and all four probably formed a matched set for one of the individuals buried  in the tomb. The traces of a mat shroud with the last burial are important. No  other burial in any tomb in Oaxaca has produced evidence of a shroud. It  is possible that other burials at Lambityeco and elsewhere in the Valley of  Oaxaca were covered with shrouds of which no traces remain. nOteS 1. This chapter represents a revised and expanded version of an earlier article  on Tomb 6 published by Lind (2002). 2. Osteophytosis refers to the development of nodules of dense bone along the  margins of articulations related to the aging process or to trauma. 3. By its very nature, the lintel offering had to be removed each time the tomb  was opened and replaced each time the hole in front of the façade was filled. The  hole in front of the façade was opened and filled at least five times to place five  burials before the sixth and final burial was interred through the roof of the main  chamber. However, the tomb was also most likely reopened an additional number  of times to retrieve the bones of immediate ancestors once the f lesh had decayed  and also to conduct rituals invoking the ancestors. 4. Trabecular tissue, in contrast with dense cortical tissue, characterizes the  inner structure in the ends of long bones or in other anatomical elements such as  the bodies of vertebrae, sacrum, or pelvic bones. This beam-like structure reduces  the overall weight of bones at the same time that it provides strength for the at- tachment of muscles. </page> <page sequence="62">  </page> </plain_text>
