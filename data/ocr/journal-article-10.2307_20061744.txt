Reviewed by: Savia Viegas, Kishinchand Chellaram College, University of Mumbai, India. The two books under review highlight different histories of art and culture. One reads the saga of movements, ideas, traditions, and people, whereas the other uses art as testimony of power, dominance, conquest, and state formation. The former, garnering cultural vignettes, looks at sites of assimilation between continents, communities, and socioreligious groups, and the latter at markers of exclusion. Along the Silk Road spans a distance of almost seven thousand miles from China through Central Asia, Northern India, and the Parthian empire to the Roman Empire, covering the years from 200 b.c.e. to the fourteenth century c.E. In popular imagination, the Silk Road is a romantic, almost paradisiacal stretch, where the East meets the West, but in the realm of academia, it has been constructed to carry the hegemony of overbearing European domina tion over the Asiatic cultures. At another level, scholars have also constructed different mod els of Asian society and oriental despotism based on Asiatic modes of production while often underestimating the role of urban centers and cultural diffusion. Against these interpretive traditions, recent archaeological findings have supplemented the earlier body of evidence. UNESCO has sponsored and organized large-scale expeditions which have brought to light the nuances of the cultural and material transactions on the Silk Road. Along the Silk Road collapses definitions of East and West, the colonial ordering of knowledge, and its primacy to western civilization. It highlights the microspecificities of the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1257 Silk Route, enhancing its value as an artery linking East to West while pulsing through inte gral ancient civilizations. Using the Silk Road as a leitmotif, the book examines a series of cultural influences that metamorphosed over 1600 years. The term "Silk Road" was coined by Baron Ferdinand Von Richtofen in 1877. One of the earliest explorers on the Silk Road was General Zhang Qian of the Han dynasty (206 B.c.E. to 220 ce.). Ideas, objects, and cultures moved back and forth, East and West, because people wanted them through fashion, economic necessity, or an aesthetic appreciation of the exotic. Cellist YoYo Ma, the initiator of the Silk Road Project, in 1998 called this unique exchange "the Internet highway of antiquity," where knowledge was celebrated rather than merely appropriated. In a series of exchanges, horses, ivory, exotic animals, and plants were swapped for silk. Silk was the commodity in demand in Rome, glass and coral were sought after commodities in China, and it was the Indian merchants who acted as intermediaries. The road in question was actually a medley of caravan routes, a network of trails-trading routes, and emporia scattered over Eurasia. Using music, silk, glass, metal, religion, clothing, architecture, technology, and cinema, the book refreshes links to discover unique trajectories unexplored by earlier historiographies. No one had traveled the length of the route, but a series of trade linkages and product demands had activated one of the most trampled travel routes in history. Merchandise traveled long distances, and so did culture. The book under review pro vides us refreshing leads into a different understanding of cultural exchanges: the migration of music cultures, which reflect history, fashion, silk, woolen and linen fibers, astrology, the geography of sacred sites, and technology transfer through travel. Merchants, artisans, and the entertainers lived in close proximity to elites, and maintained links to rural areas and for eign countries through handicrafts and trade. Religion was also an important institution for regulating social life. Buddhism, which originated in India in 600 b.c.e. took advantage of the mobility of the Silk Road to extend itself to China, where it outlasted its popularity in its native land. Buddhist missionaries and merchants were companions on the Silk Road, spreading the idea of worship and belief, and in the process transforming Buddha into a god for the Chinese. Consequently, Indian art found a new abode via the Silk Road. At one level was the development of Hellenistic art which made the first anthropomorphic images of Buddha. This style actually wove together Greek, Roman, Iranian, Bactrian, and Parthian visual imagery along with Indie Buddhistical philosophy in the creation of Buddha image. In the second strand, the visual metaphors of Buddha and Buddhist philosophy spread to East Asia. Thus Along the Silk Road redefines the Silk Road journeys as unique examples of inter continental cooperation and collaboration of thought and commerce, which ultimately resulted in borrowing and lending in the realms of ideas, art, and culture. Regarding Pearls of the Parrot of India, Moghul art has undoubtedly begun to assert a greater presence in the lexicon of world art, with a series of Islamic art exhibitions in the U.S. and the U.K. and the Festival of India abroad. However, the older conceptual approaches of Sir J. S. Mill and VA. Smith still impinge upon the understanding of complex medieval cultural history. Poetry, calligraphy, and painting were synergized to produce Khamsas or illustrated manuscripts. The Khamsas were repositories of visual art representing the brilliance of Moghul ateliers' best painters, master calligraphers, and poets. These manuscripts were ornamental devices allowing the reader to linger with pleasure and project sentiments aroused in the text. Pearls of the Parrot of!ndia:The Walter's Art Museum Khamsa of Amir Khusraw</page><page sequence="3">1258 Sixteenth Century Journal XXXIV/4 (2003) of Dehli, examines Khamsas dating from the 1590s and took fifteen years of research. It highlights the Khamsas of Amir Khusraw, the well known Persian poet, and bears the renowned calligraphy of Muhammad Husayn al-Kashmiri. The publication has paintings, illuminations, and borders from the Walter's Khamsa, biography of Amir Khusraw, analysis of Khamsa as a literary genre, and a background of Mughul paintings. It analyzes in detail the role of artists and artistic traditions and in the pro cess posits some important questions. What working methods and cultural expectations led artists to imitate portions of earlier images or to produce entirely new images? How can the illustrated manuscripts be assigned family trees? What were the canonical directions guiding artists in different ateliers? Artists copied ideas from older manuscripts to demonstrate a mas tery of tradition, a fact that Khusraw, himself, admitted and which has become the defining motif of Indian cultural continuity. Most of the paintings have propagandistic considerations, often overshadowing human concerns. Cultures of nonelite groups, which would have brought in an everyday perspective of work, ritual, caste, and gender relations, are conspicuous by their absence. This was prob ably because the art production of Moghul society was a product of royal patronage, into which were woven ideologies of power. New dynasties and new emperors needed ancient pasts and centrality of focus to achieve stability in a constantly shifting landscape of kings and kingly power. Nonetheless, one of the challenges for art historians working on Indian art has been the lack of access to medieval artworks which are either in private collections abroad or adversely suffer from the degree of custodianship which is inherent and endemic in national cultural institutions. Such publications certainly improve the picture.</page></plain_text>
