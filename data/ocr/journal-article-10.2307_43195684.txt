<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLONIAL ENCOUNTER: SELF, IDENTITY AND OTHER IN MODERN ARABIC INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE Terri De Young For Roger: A master of his subject, and an individual of rare integrity and energy, who should be an inspiration to us all The Self To even the most casual observer, one of the hallmarks of Arabic intellectual discussion after World War II was an increasingly heightened concern with what was perceived as an ongoing crisis in identity, and an intensifying focus on the sense of an imminent loss of a secure concept of the "self." A convenient starting point for charting the trajectory of this crisis would seem to be in the publication - just before and after the end of the War - of articles calling for social reform and for more avenues through which all classes of the Arab people could participate in intellectual life.1 Many of these articles targeted areas such as health reform and educational reform, rather than reform of the political structure, probably in part because of wartime censorship regulations still in force in 1945. But, in the majority of instances, these essays also incorporated analyses of the need for a restructuring of the self on an individual level. As the Lebanese academic Tawfïq Hasan al-Shartūnī (d. 1962) put it in an article published in the Egyptian periodical Al-Risãla in mid- 1944, speculating on the changes that might follow the end of World War II: I do not believe that the deviant morals ( al-akhlãq al-shādhdha) and twisted instincts [occasioned by wartime conditions] in this mysterious so-called "human being" (al-insãn) can ever be straightened out and changed solely by straightening out institutions or changing laws. However much reformers and legislators exercise their creative minds, their creativity will remain so much ink on paper as long as they do not impart some lasting truths ( 'ilm rãhin) that will exercise power over human instincts in themselves, truths 1 Notable examples include Muhammad Mandūr's series of articles in al-Risāla in 1944 and 1 945 concerning the need for educational reform to combat the widespread illiteracy still present in Egypt after decades of modern government ("Al-Akhdh 'an Urubbā" 574 (3 July 1944): 544- 46; "Al-Tawāzun al-Ijtimā'F' 584 (11 September 1944): 741-43; "Mukāfahat al-Shakliyya," 586 (25 September 1944): 881-83; "Ummiyya al-Muta'allimln" 588 (7 October 1944): 901-03; "Al- Tafakkur al-Madhhabf' 590 (23 October 1 944):941 -43; "Al-'Aqliyya al-Misriyya" 592 (6 November 1944): 981-83; "Sha'b Misr" 596 (4 December 1944): 1061-63; "Al-Thaqāfa wal- Akhlâq" 598 (18 December 1944):2001-03; "Dirāsat al-Lugha al-'Arabiyya wa-Ādābihā 600 (1 January 1945):5-7, and also Muhammad Sabn's "'liai al-Mujtama' al-Misrī," in al-Risãla 605 (5 February 1945): 124, and 606 (12 February 1945): 144; as well as the editorials by Albīr Adīb in al-Adīb June and July 1945.</page><page sequence="2">28 which would be able to dominate their basic elements, permit "human beings" to control their waywardness, and direct them to the right road toward acceptance of new forms of organizations and newly instituted laws. (Shartūnī 1944:610) To a certain extent, such sentiments about the individual echo strongly and reinvigorate a debate first raised by the generation of intellectuals who dominated the inter-war years - among them Tāhā Husayn (d. 1973), Tawfìq al-Haklm (d. 1987) and the DIwän Group of poets - who had in their writings focused on the delineation of what might be called a "strong" self. This self was characterized by such qualities as energy, determination, focus, and rationalism, and took its inspiration from the self-referential skepticism of Descartes as reinterpreted by the Comtean influenced positivism still in force in turn of the century France (and to a lesser extent England), where most of these Egyptian intellectuals had received their education. Such attention to the construction of a strong self can be interpreted as a direct response - and certainly a challenge - to some of the colonial writing produced in the early part of the twentieth century by British and French administrators, in which the mentality of Egyptians and other "Orientals" was frequently characterized as a cognitively disassociated set of fragments, incapable of coherent reasoning. This attitude is extraordinarily pervasive in writing ranging from the flowery flights of rhetoric to be found in an anonymous tract in the Edinburgh Review , which compares the "Arab mind" to the wrong side of a tapestry, covered with brilliant threads of many colors, but "woven into no intelligible design," to Lord Cromer's prosaic but far more devastatingly authoritative observation (because Cromer was able to translate his judgments into action): Endeavor to elicit a plain statement of facts from an ordinary Egyptian. His explanation will generally be lengthy, and wanting in lucidity. He will probably contradict himself half-a-dozen times before he has finished his story (Baring 1908:147). Such people, it follows of course, could hardly be trusted with the responsibilities of political self-rule. Tāhā Husayn Of the generation of intellectuals influenced by contending currents of thought necessitating the construction of a strong self, Tāhā Husayn probably represents the most interesting case for analysis, partly because of the length of his career, which allowed for a telling evolution of his ideas, and partly because he was not only an intellectual gadfly but also a university administrator and an official in the Egyptian Ministry of Education, which gave him an unusual opportunity to put his theories about "self' development</page><page sequence="3">29 into practice. As a recent book by Linda Marie Brooks about the construction of self in a Western philosophical and theoretical context puts it, "[e]ducation has always been seen in terms of the self: we educate in a very large sense to PRODUCE "selves" (Brooks 1995:14). Tāhā Husayn's first notable foray into the field of "self' definition turned out to be his most enduringly successful literary work: the first volume of his autobiography Al-Ayyãm (The Days). In this work - cast, significantly, in the omniscient third-person - he describes his experiences as a young boy, blinded in early childhood, who triumphs over the poverty, disease and ignorance of village life to achieve a measure of acceptance at Al-Azhar, the center of traditional Islamic education in Egypt. Although it is presented in the form of a truthful narrative and is accordingly possessed of a certain extra authority in an Arabic literary context, Al-Ayyãm also echoes the classic form of a Bildungsroman , or novel of education (or personal development). Thus its underlying theme is very much the formation of a self, accomplished through the process of education. The first volume of Al-Ayyãm, which ends with Husayn's arrival in the big city to study at Al-Azhar, was serialized in Al-Hilãl in 1926-27. The second volume, which takes his career through his adolescence, his break with the traditions of Islamic education, and his enrollment in Egypt's first secular university, was published shortly thereafter, in 1929. The final volume, detailing his experiences in the West, his final triumph in obtaining the first French doctorate granted to an Egyptian by the Sorbonne in Paris, and his marriage to a young French woman who becomes his guide and inspiration, was, however, not published until 1973, half a century later. These publication dates and the time periods they cover are significant for a number of reasons. The first two volumes focus on the turn of the century, a period when relations between the British occupation forces and the Egyptians were fraying and under noticeable pressure for the first time since the invasion of 1882; and yet there is no mention of the British in Husayn's writing. It is almost as though they do not exist. Not even the traumatic events of Dinshaway (1906), which resonate even today for many Egyptians, make it into the second volume of Al-Ayyãm , which covers the period between 1902 and 1912. We cannot assume that this occurs because the author wishes to exclude all references to politics since one of the running themes of the second volume concerns the internal struggles between reformers and traditionalists within the university system itself. What this selective "inward turn" would seem to do, rather, is to allow Husayn to ignore, in what were apparently productive ways for him,2 certain relations of power in the world beyond his own local society and to focus more 2 In her study of al-Ayyãm , Fedwa Malti-Douglas provides a perceptive guide to Tāhā Husayn's slowly growing confidence in his self image, which eventually allows him to narrate the enactment of a triumph over Western power through a geography lesson at the end of volume.</page><page sequence="4">30 exclusively on what Michel Foucault has called the "technologies" (from the Greek tekhne , "art, design") of the self, that permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality (Foucault 1988:18). For Arab intellectuals from the turn of the century to World War II, then, these are operations that are seen as best being conducted outside an explicit recognition that Western stereotypes about the "oriental" were damaging or harmful to those they were directed against.3 The lesson being promulgated, it would seem, was that only after a strong, cohesive self was articulated could one directly and successfully confront challenges or threats from outside. It is this orientation toward the world that seems to link intellectual discourse during this period on numerous fronts, from Al-Ayyãm to Shartūnī's article. It was not that they saw political opposition as irrelevant to their concerns, but that they saw something else as being a necessary precursor to confrontation with oppression imposed from outside. 1945 and After By the end of World War II and in the period immediately following, however, this common and tacit consensus that such operations of "self- formation" needed to be enacted far from the political arena, and without overt reference to it, was beginning to break down. The appeals for change in the mental makeup of the individual (his or her "self-fashioning") in articles of this period were often closely paralleled, frequently in works from the same author, by an equally strong voicing of the conviction that both (probably deliberately unnamed) local elements in the society and the colonial powers would move to block such initiatives. Thus we find, for example, Albir Adib, the editor of the influential Lebanese journal Al-Adīb confidently predicting that in the new postwar Arab society social reform would have to entail a "revolution" in thought with its source in the individual conscience, and could not be a fiat imposed from above (AcEb 1945b:2). This is what might be expected, on the basis of intellectual discourse earlier formulated in the same vein. But then, in the same editorial, the author begins to speak of sinister forces who would "play games with the rights of the people," forces which, in the preceding month's editorial he had characterized more explicitly as those "who would choke off every voice 3 The importance of Husayn's example for his colleagues can be seen in Tawfïq al -Hakim' s comment from the early 1930s (shortly after the publication of Al-Ayyãm) that "there is no doubt that the Egyptian mind has changed today beneath [the influence of] your magic wand... We were half blind, we had no sense of identity." (al-Haklm 1933:5).</page><page sequence="5">31 along the path leading to liberation from the prisons of their reactionism and traditions, which they create anew with the ages, so that the chains of the people, the 'manacles' of society, should be in their hands, and nothing should be set free unless they will it so" (1945b:2). Such a description is general enough to fit both indigenous oppressors and foreign ones, yet does not ignore the fact that, however strong the determination and cohesiveness of an individual's will, forces outside of it could play a determining role in derailing its teleological trajectory toward self-fulfillment. A more pointed attack on resurgent colonialism, and an especially articulate and eloquent expression of how the competing claims of the European belligerents were understood and discounted by the Arab intellectual community, can be found in Fu'ād Wasfï Abū al-Dhahab's "Min Kutub al-Sharq wal-Gharb: Ustūrat al-Hurriyya" ("From Books East and West: The Myth of Freedom"):4 For six years the world has been plunged into a crushing war... in defense of freedom and democracy. Hitler claimed that he was fighting to free Europe and to raise up a new order after destroying British colonialism and the Bolshevist pestilence. Likewise, the Allies claimed that they were defending freedom, right, democracy, and were seeking to raise up a world that would be better than the current one. Finally, the war has come to an end, and as the wings of peace flutter over the land, the leaders of nations are now competing with one another to see how fast they can bring down an impenetrable curtain over those beautiful dreams and over the honeyed words they used to pronounce in ringing tones during the long days of the War. Each one of them is eagerly pursuing a colonial policy that will implement his own country's goals, without regard for justice and freedom of action among the smaller nations and the defeated ones. And how frankly Mr. Churchill spoke when he was Prime Minister in the midst of the tumult: "I have not come to rule in this country in order to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire" (Abū al- Dhahab 1946:596) Although hindsight suggests that decolonization was inevitable and expected after the War, passages such as this one remind us that immediate postwar developments did not necessarily signal such sanguine outcomes to the protagonists. Even Tāhā Husayn himself, who was editor of the journal AÌ- 4 The same month, the prominent Egyptian intellectual Ahmad Hasan al-Zayyāt expressed remarkably similar sentiments in the lead editorial of his journal Al-Risãla, emphasizing that the end of the War had not brought peace but injustice to the Middle East. See his "Urūbbā wal- Islām," Al-Risãla 653 (January 1946): 1-2.</page><page sequence="6">32 Kātib al-Misrī where Abū al-Dhahab's article appeared, had in October 1945 written an analysis of future British intentions for the colonies which suggested a significant reversal of his earlier policy of ignoring British influence in Egypt the better to concentrate on re-defining and empowering the Egyptian self (Husayn 1945). Husayn begins with a lengthy review of the history of British and French colonialism in what he calls, somewhat unusually in Arabic usage, but common in British writing of the time, the "Near East" {al-sharq al-adnā ), thus at first appearing subtly to adopt the Western point of view. In this part of the article the focus is on the active rivalry between France and Britain for dominance over the other in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He devotes substantial space, for example, to an account of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and his subsequent ouster by the British. The Arabs, and Egypt in particular, are absent, their countries only a backdrop to the narrative development of a binary superpower struggle. Then, out of nowhere, Muhammad 'All and his attempts to construct a modern state in Egypt emerge, in the following sentence: "There is no doubt that the policies of Muhammad 'All were an influential factor in the competition between the two Western powers" (Husayn 1945: 1 16) This lack of inquiry into the motivation of the actors, especially those from the "Near East," their abrupt insertion into the narrative, and their equally abrupt disappearance, become a characteristic strategy from this point forward. Later in the same paragraph, for example, Husayn uses this same maneuver when characterizing the Egyptian reaction to British attempts to portray themselves as disinterested friends of the locals over and against French "meddling" in Ottoman affairs: "For some reason Egypt did not throw herself into the arms of this helpful, warm friend, but rather remained oriented toward France" (Husayn 1945:116, emphasis added). These characterizations by Husayn play into the stereotypes found in Western colonialist discourse that emphasize the rationality and activism of the Western sovereign self as contrasted with the irrationality, passivity and femininity of the colonized "other." As Husayn' s narrative progresses, however, the positions are gradually reversed. The "Near East" becomes the "Arab East" ( al-sharq al- ' arabi) and the actions of its inhabitants become more directed and better motivated: "The Arab East began to look at the two Western powers with a similar eye, seeing in them an adversary hostile to its freedom, interposing themselves between it and its aspirations, and its desire for independence." Meanwhile, the British and French grow increasingly capricious and unpredictable. Britain's policies in the Mandate period are described as an unsettling combination of "violence and leniency," while France is seen as even worse, giving</page><page sequence="7">33 the appearance of being tolerant on one occasion, and then would not hesitate to retreat to a narrow, violent stance on another. It would conclude a pact, then not hesitate to repudiate it. By this the French policy lost the trust of the Arab East and its willingness to rely on it (Husayn 1945: 118). Husayn concludes by portraying 1945 as a potential watershed in the relationship between the European colonial powers and Arab countries. The occupation and the system of supervision and tutelage imposed by the mandate system no longer has validity, not only because the institutional structures necessary for self-governance are in place, but even more because "the soul of the Arab East has awakened from its sleep," ready to seek its just place in the world. Thus: [Nļothing stands between it and the achievement of this noble goal, except one thing: that Great Britain, together with its allies, should understand that the values of things have changed... and that the nations of the Arab East have reached the point of having enough political capacity, self-confidence (al-thiqa bil-nafs ), and self reliance (al-i'timād ' alā al-jahd al-khãss) that they are no longer able to accept a political life that does not include liberty and independence (Husayn 1945:118). Again, as in Shartūnī's article, it is the power of the strong self (the "Arab East" being "SELF-confident" and "SELF-reliant") and not the greater cohesiveness of the social order, which becomes the guarantor of success in the future. Tāhā Husayn' s conviction that he and his fellows had achieved sufficient mastery of themselves legitimately to seek the assertion of their rights never wavered after this. In a sense, it finds a culmination in his famous keynote speech at the Second International Arab Writers Conference in 1956 where he takes as a given the power of the Arab sovereign self and lashes out at a West he portrays for the first time as an unjustly hostile "other" motivated entirely by self-interest. This hostility is concentrated in its gaze: It does not, therefore, look at us as equals; rather it looks at us with a gaze that has the flavor of the death knell in it, as well as a great deal of contempt. We are weak and they are strong and powerful; we are poor and they are rich and well-off. . . Just so, they look at us with this gaze. Then, if an Arabic book is placed before them, they may glance at the cover, but before they open it or look into it, they leave, because it is the book of a man from this weak nation which has not yet arrived at the point of being worth concerning oneself about, or listening to. This feeling and this conviction - which has</page><page sequence="8">34 been encountered by everyone who knows the West and who associates with Westerners in our land - is what requires that we be as well equipped as possible to oppose and to extricate ourselves from [any involvement with] them (Husayn 1956:92). This malevolent Western "other," whose power over the Arab self is evinced in its gaze, is remarkably reminiscent of the dialectic of consciousness articulated by Jean-Paul Sartre in his classic L ' Être et le néant ( Being and Nothingness) (1943), composed during the tension-laden and threatening atmosphere of wartime Paris under Nazi occupation. Sartre / 1956 Sartre first develops his ideas (only latent in earlier works like L Imaginaire and La Nausée) about the perception by the self of other people as being centrally constitutive of identity in Being and Nothingness. For him, once the reflective mind recognizes the presence of others as objects in its own field of perception, this opens up the possibility that one's self also exists as an object for others. Such a perception limits the selfs freedom of action, which, for Sartre, entails the emotional reaction of inadequacy, limitation and shame: Now shame... is shame of SELF; it is the RECOGNITION of the fact that I AM indeed that object which the Other is looking at and judging. I can be ashamed only as my freedom escapes me in order to become a GIVEN object... When I am alone, I cannot realize my "being-seated"; at most it can be said that I simultaneously both am it and am not it. But in order for me to be what I am, it suffices merely that the Other look at me. It is not for myself, to be sure; I myself shall never succeed at realizing this being-seated which I grasp in the Other's look. . . . For the Other I AM SEATED as this inkwell is on the table; for the Other, I am leaning over the keyhole as this tree IS BENT by the wind. Thus for the Other I have stripped myself of transcendence. . . [...] My original fall is the existence of the Other. Shame - like pride - is the apprehension of myself as a nature although that very nature escapes me and is unknowable as such. Strictly speaking, it is not that I perceive myself losing my freedom in order to become a THING, but my nature is - over there, outside my lived freedom - as a given attribute for this being which I am for the Other. I grasp the Other's look at the very center of my ACT as the solidification and alienation of my own possibilities (Sartre 1956: 350-52).</page><page sequence="9">35 In other words, an individual's recognition of his or her status as a "self' can only be activated by the awareness of an "other" outside the Self. Later, Sartre will go on to argue that any attempt by the Self to ignore this Other whose presence threatens it risks turning the Other into an equally denatured object, "stripped of transcendence" in its turn. Though the relevance of Sartre's description to the experience of occupation (whether the Nazi occupation of Paris or the colonial occupation of subject territories) cannot be denied, it was not immediately seized upon and overtly deployed for these purposes in the discourses of the colonized. Frantz Fanon in 1952 was probably the first to recognize its potential in this regard and acknowledge Sartre's influence.5 Nevertheless, Sartre was already well known in Arab intellectual circles by the time of Husayn's speech in 1956. His fame rested primarily on his support of the idea of "commitment" in literature, as Anwar al-Ma'addāwī tells us (1953:12-15), but it had not been limited to that. In fact, the earliest appearance of articles about his ideas can be found in Al-Kātib al-Misrī , the journal edited by Tāhā Husayn, in 1945 and 1946. There, along with a translation of his article on "The Nationalization of Literature," were two articles outlining the theories found in L 'Imaginaire ( The Psychology of the Imagination ), where Sartre first works out the structure of consciousness and his ideas about le néant which form the underpinnings of his existentialist psychology in Being and Nothingness. The "Sartre of the mind, of consciousness, and of the self' would therefore not have been unfamiliar to Husayn and his colleagues. Even more to the point, an article by RInā HabashI, entitled "FT Itār al-qalaq al-Wujūdī wal-Nazar 'inda Sārtr wa- Mārsīl" (In the Framework of Existential Anxiety and the Gaze for Sartre and [Gabriel] Marcel) appeared in Al-Adab just a few months before Husayn's speech was printed in the same journal, tying Sartre's views directly to the application of terms like anxiety and anguish (&lt; qalaq ) to the reaction of the self, and struggle ( nizã *) and opposition ( mu'ārada ) as the natural relation with the Other. Some of these had already become key terms for younger Arab writers when describing their sense of an identity crisis in the postwar world. The rest would be adopted in short order. 1956 is not only the year about which one can legitimately speak of Sartrean ideas being assimilated into modern Arab thought. Their relevance was given additional cogency by the fact that this was also the year of the Suez crisis, when France and Britain, with the help of Israel, made a last- 5 Les damnés de la terre ( The Wretched of the Earth ) (1961) was, of course, accompanied by a preface written by Sartre himself. But even the much earlier Peau noire, masques blancs ( Black Skin, White Masks) (1952) exhibits familiarity with most of Sartre's mature work, including L 'Être et le néant , especially in Chapter 5, "The Fact of Blackness," which begins with the famous scene describing Fanon' s reaction when a white child "recognized" him and said, "Look, a negro!" The dynamics of this scene recall Sartre's description of the Selfs reaction when it becomes aware of the Other (see Fanon 1967:109-1 10 and also 138, where L 'Être et le néant is cited by name.)</page><page sequence="10">36 ditch bid to hold on to their colonial hegemonies through an invasion of the Suez Canal Zone. Although the impact of the incident is greatly minimized in most current standard accounts of modern Middle East history, at the time it generated an enormous amount of verbiage: speeches, articles, commentaries. Nevertheless, despite its current obscurity, Suez can still be seen as a kind of intellectual dividing line: after Suez, the old patterns of colonial relationships would no longer hold true and would have to be replaced by new ones. Suez and Poetry The Suez Crisis left its imprint on Arabic poetry, visible in particular in the large number of poetic works produced in 1956 and 1957 dealing with the question of the relationship between self and other, even among authors who had not devoted much attention to the question before. This is especially interesting because poetry (and other forms of imaginative literature) in the immediate postwar period had not shared in the increasing attention paid to issues of resistance to the continuance of colonialism (implicitly demanding a recognition of the "other" as a constructed category) in the work of essayists and non-fiction writers following World War II. True, there are exceptions to this, but by and large poets continued to be concerned with the internalized analysis of subjectivity to be found in pre-War literary models such as Tāhā Husayn's Al-Ayyãm or the lyric effusions of poets associated with the Apollo Group, Ibrāhīm al-Nājī (d. 1953) or 'All Mahmūd Tāhā (d. 1949), for instance, both of whom continued to be popular even among the "new generation" of poets through the end of the 1940s.6 This generalization applies to such major figures as Khalll Hāwī (d. 1982) or Adūnīs (b. 1930), as well as to the more imitative lesser voices. One partial exception to the generalization "that concerns with the "other" are neglected in Arabic poems from this period" (in favor of concerns with the self) is the work of the Iraqi poet Badr Shākir al-Sayyāb (d. 1964). Sayyâb first engages with the figure of an explicitly colonial "other" in his long, narrative poems from the early 1950s, such as "Al-Mūmis al-'Amyâ'" ("The Blind Whore") (1952), where the rape of a young Iraqi girl, Yâsmln, is depicted as being carried out by foreign soldiers: And God, the Almighty, desired 6 This is not to say, of course, that poetry in the Neoclassical style (inaugurated in the latter half of the nineteenth century) had not always engaged - and indeed continues to engage, since this style is still popular in some quarters - quite overtly with issues raised by colonial appropriations and practices. The style that succeeded Neoclassical poetry as the dominant trend, several schools that might best be subsumed under the general rubric Romantic, chose, however, to avoid discussing issues of public import to focus instead on the delineations of the poet's personal voice. So even though this later poetry did not make explicit a concern with colonialism, and the injustice and oppression to which it leads, it nevertheless saw the personal path the poet had chosen as not irrelevant to an eventual solution to the "colonial problem." For more extended discussion of these poems and their place in al-Sayyâb's oeuvre, see my Placing the Poet , ch. 8, passim.</page><page sequence="11">37 That distant cities and seas hurl into Iraq Thousands upon thousands of soldiers, so that they can take what they want, in an alley, out of all other alleys, And out of all other maidens, the bread vendor's daughter, This wretched girl, YâsmTn. (Sayyâb 1971:521) Later in the poem, these soldiers would be described in terms very similar to those of Sartre's Other as subject: The ones who raped her were not of this sort: They were like gods with scowling brows [carved] from stone, Sucking their arrogance from the terror of their victims, from their blood, Descending upon God's creatures like thunderbolts from on high. By linking the threatening "other" directly to outsiders, Sayyâb here is doing something very unusual for the poets of his immediate generation in. But not even he is willing to take the next step and explicitly identify the intruders as British soldiers; the reader must infer that link on the basis of the fact that Sayyâb was an Iraqi, and the only soldiers to be found in Iraq at this time, other than Iraqi nationals, were British troops. Far more typical of the strategy followed by poets of this period is Sayyâb's use of the figure of Judas in "Al-Maslh ba'da al-Salb" ("Christ After Crucifixion") from the year after the Suez crisis, 1957: Thus I returned, and Judas paled when he saw me For I had been his secret. He was a reflection of me, grown black, and the [physical] image of an idea Which had solidified there, with the soul drawn forth from it, He feared that it would expose the death in the water of his eyes (His eyes which are stones Where he has tried to conceal a grave from the people). He was afraid of its warmth, of something impossible for him, so he informed on it. "You? Or is that my reflection, become white, scattering light?" Have you returned from the world of death? Death [comes but] once! Thus our fathers told us, thus they taught us: was it [all] a</page><page sequence="12">38 lie?" That is what he thought when he saw me, and a glance said it (Sayyâb 1971:457). In this part of the poem, the speaker has told us that he had been placed upon the cross (whence the identification with Christ) during which he experienced a vision of himself melding into the consciousness of all those around him, sharing in a universal sense of wholeness, strength and unity. Judas, here, would then represent the Sartrean image of the Other, whose "glance," when linked with that of the speaking subject, creates the double and simultaneous subject/object relation that destroys the illusion of unity. And, in fact, the rest of "Al-Maslh ba'da al-Salb" is taken up with the speaker/Christ's struggle to re-establish that sense of unity and wholeness that will allow his sacrifice of himself to become meaningful. What is important to note here, however, is that this delineation of the "other," no matter how searing its indictment of the relationship created, has nothing to link it directly to colonial experience. Rather, its applicability is universalized and made relevant to any situation where the self is compelled to interact with "others" and thus to recognize that its sovereign power is limited. Such is the case here, even though we are dealing both with a poem composed by an author who had not shown himself reluctant to confront this relationship elsewhere in his poetry, and also one composed during or shortly after a political crisis which had brought this issue back to the forefront in a very dramatic way. Other poets would respond differently to these events. In the case of two other major poets, Khalll Hāwī and Adūnīs, the trajectory would be reversed. Suez and its attendant intellectual atmosphere would stimulate them to engage with the question of the "other" in ways they had never done before. But in neither case would they continue to pursue this path. Khalll Hāwī, for example, had just arrived in England to begin his doctoral studies in literary theory and criticism at Cambridge University under the guidance of F. R. Leavis and A. J. Arberry. He had been in the country only a matter of weeks when the Suez Crisis began, and his reactions to that event occasioned a poem, "FT Bilādihim" ("In Their Land"), that provides an almost textbook delineation of the Sartrean dialectic of "self' and "other," as can be seen in this extract from the poem's first two stanzas: The racket of the coffeeshop, the Egyptian student's eye holds mine The news of the battle: "Our army is beating Egypt Our army is advancing, occupying the Canal." Then the Jazz begins to wail, and with it wails Christine, she wails, wrapped up in thecommonplace,</page><page sequence="13">39 In the pipe smoker's eyes Questions churn: About the expense of freight and gasoline About the exchange rate of the riyal. . . ! But between the Egyptian student's eyes and mine [stretch] corpses, Blood from the victims of "The Port," from the tears of men. I left, not knowing where I was going A muddy fog blinded the street lamps, And a thousand deaf eyes, not speaking Yet saying: "You are an outcast ( manbūdh ) a stranger ( gharīb )." They screamed: "You are an outcast, a stranger," Finish me off, suck my blood, Tear me to pieces with your fangs! They screamed: "You are an outcast, a stranger, And tomorrow Lebanon will be crushed, And the people of Lebanon exiled, begging from other nations." But a thousand deaf eyes, not speaking Yet saying: "You are an outcast, a stranger, You will be begging from other nations!" (Hāwī 1957:10) Particularly notable in the poem's development is the emphasis on the visual, on the "gaze" as an instrument of control and judgment. The sympathetic exchange of glances between the speaker and the Egyptian student in the first section, which bespeak a meaningful sharing of perception and sympathy, is transformed in the second section to the reference to the strangers' eyes that are "deaf," mute and yet at the same time "scream" at the speaker: "You are an outcast, a stranger." Nevertheless, while this poem virtually inaugurates one of the most productive phases in HâwT's poetic career, a time when most of the poems published in his first collection, Al-Nahr wal-Ramãd (The River and Ashes, 1957) were composed, it remains an oddity in that group. All the other poems, notably "Al-Bahhār wal-DarwIsh" ("The Mariner and the Dervish")7 which heads the group of poems in their published form, focus on the self alone, rather than the dialectic of self and other. In this they are closer to the concerns of the thirties than they are reflective of postwar developments. Interestingly, Hāwī chose to omit "FT Bilādihim" from his collection and it 7 For a translation of the poem, see Khouri and Algar (1974:60-65) and Haydar and Beard in this volume.</page><page sequence="14">40 did not appear again after its initial publication in the literary journal Al-Ādāb in February 1957. Adūnīs Adūnīs's engagement with the subject was even more indirect, though perhaps ultimately more longlasting. For a long time, he had explored the issue of how the poet/speaker should establish a relationship to political involvement and, more particularly, the political leader. Such concerns are clear from his early elegiac verses about the death of the SSNP leader Antūn Sa4 āda (d. 1949), many of which were eventually incorporated into his early attempt at an epic poem, Al-Ard (The Earth). This inevitably led to a grappling with the question of how the speaking self could come to an understanding of the seemingly foreign mindset and experiences entailed in the practices of inspired political leadership. These are most tellingly recorded in the 1957 poem, "Al-Ba'th wal-Ramād" ("Resurrection and Ashes") where the leader-figure addressed by the poet is symbolically cast in the form of a phoenix, the mythical bird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes: Phoenix, when the flame embraces you, which pen will you grasp? And your lost down, how will you find your way to its like? And as the ashes drown you, what world will you sense? And what [new] garb would you wish for? What color would you like? And what will you suffer as each spasm fades? (Adūnīs 1985:157). This series of rhetorical questions (because no answers are provided) directed at the phoenix indicate the speaker's desire to project his consciousness outward and make a connection between his values and those of phoenix/other. But, as a I have suggested elsewhere (DeYoung 1988:218-19), in this early part of the poem he fails because he seeks simply to project his own emotions onto the phoenix, thus denying it a truly independent "otherness." His imprisonment within a solipsistic universe leads him almost immediately to seize upon the theme of estrangement from others, in Arabic, ghurba, literally "the feeling of being apart, of being a stranger or foreigner": Your estrangement, which causes death, is mine also The estrangement of every hero. Your estrangement which loves, which becomes</page><page sequence="15">41 drunken,8 Your estrangement which dies, dreading others Your estrangement which dies, craving others Your estrangement, which causes death, is mine also. No mother above your stifled chest, No father whose bending heart would revive you (Adūnīs 1985:158) Though the speaker here asserts his kinship with the phoenix, at this point in the poem it is merely an assertion. It will require almost another three hundred lines of verse, including alternate visions of the phoenix as both Christ and the Sumerian god of death and rebirth, Tammuz, before the speaker will be able to find a way to a sustainable vision of the other. At least one other poem of this period, "Sami'tuhu wa-Famuhu Hijāratun" ("I Heard Him and His Mouth Was Stones"), can be fruitfully read as an exploration of the dynamic relationship of self and other. In the years immediately following, however, Adūnīs reverted to a preoccupation with the delineation of the "strong self' in the series of poems eventually published in Aghānī Mihyãr al-Dimashqī (Songs of Mihyar the Damascene), which broadly concern themselves with exploring the role of the poet as a creator figure. The tone for this focus on the creative power of the poet (in this case Adūnīs' s fictional creation, Mihyar the Damascene, based on the real eleventh-century Shi 'ite poet Mihyâr al-Daylamī), to chart a new path for his existence without reference to the Other is set by the prose poem, "Fāris al- Kalimāt al-Gharîba" ("The Knight of Strange Words"), which opens the collection: He approaches unarmed like the forest, like the rainclouds that will not be turned back. Yesterday he carried a continent and moved the sea from its place. He draws the scruff of the day, he makes from his feet a day and borrows the shoes of the night, then waits for what does not come. He is the physics of things - he recognizes them and names them with names he does not reveal. He is reality and its negation, life and non-life. Where the stone becomes a lake and the shadow a city, he lives - he lives and misleads despair erasing the vastness of hope, dancing for the soil so that it can yawn, and for the trees so that they can sleep. And here he is announcing the junctures of the extremes, inscribing on the forehead of our age the magic marks. He fills up life, but no one sees him. He makes life into sea foam, then dives into it. He transforms tomorrow into a hunted animal and runs after it in despair. Inscribed are his words, in the 8 "Nashwän" which I have translated as "drunken" here, is a term used in Islamic mysticism for the ecstatic emotion the worshipper feels when in the presence of the Divine, often compared to the intoxication experienced on drinking alcoholic beverages.</page><page sequence="16">42 direction of loss, loss, loss. Confusion is his homeland, but he is full of eyes. He terrifies and refreshes. He exudes disaster and overflows with ironic humor. He peels man like an onion. He is the wind that does not move backward and the water that does not return to its source. He creates his kind in the beginning from himself - he has no forebears, and in his footsteps are his roots (Adūnīs 1985: 249). Here the poet interacts with his environment (consistently described in anthropomorphic terms), constantly reshaping it into new forms. But the frenetic activity recorded in these lines leaves very little room for the kind of insistent, penetrating interrogation of another sentient consciousness that is the dominant rhetorical strategy of "Resurrection and Ashes." This willed ignoring of the subjective/objective dialectic is very reminiscent of similar choices made by creative writers in the 1930s and 1940s, and it is perhaps no surprise that Adūnīs's commentary on his own work shows a marked continuity with that of the preceding generation, rather than a radical departure. As recently as the mid-1990s he addressed his fellow intellectuals in an interview: I say to the Arab, to the Arab poet: 'I am for opening up (al-infitãh) to the Other (al-ãkhar). And I believe that the Other is not solely a foreigner (&lt; ajnabí ), rather he is a basic dimension and a formative element of all the dimensions of the Self (&lt; al-dhãt ). The Other is the reverse image (al-sūra al-ukhrã) of the Self. This is something I do not hesitate to say, and a position I still advocate. But it has a pre- condition (shart). The pre-condition is that you must know your Self. Or try to know it. If you do not know who you are, it will be impossible for you to know the Other or to interact with him. For you will, at that very time, displace him (sa-tanquluhu naqlan) (Adūnīs 1996: 56-57). Though this view acknowledges the Sartrean dialectic of Self and Other as its starting point for definition, it ultimately rejects Sartre's reading of that dialectic as resulting in the psychological dominance of the Other, and the destabilization of any attempt to create a secure "sense of the Self." In fact, it asserts quite the opposite (and a position with which Tāhā Husayn, as the author of Al-Ayyãm , would have been in agreement), that engagement with the Other can only rest on, and begin with, a complete and thorough interrogation of what subjectivity - in the active mode - means. For all its positive implications, however, this seems to mean that for the major poets of the postwar period, the 1950s and 1960s, colonialism would remain terra incognita.</page><page sequence="17">43 It is not, in fact, until another political crisis, the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, compels Arab poets to re-think their relationship to their colonial past and the impact it has left upon their world that we find a noticeable willingness to acknowledge that the colonial period was one of psychic trauma that could not just be forgotten and left behind. In the wake of this event, the 1967 war, older poets like Adūnīs and new voices like that of Amai Dunqul (d. 1983) would make notable new forays into this hitherto barely charted terrain. But the most important voices in this period after 1967 would, of course, be those of the Palestinian poets who had emerged in the 1960s, such as Mahmüd Darwlsh (b. 1941) and Samlh al-Qāsim (b. 1939). For them, negotiating a relationship between themselves and the Israeli Other was part of the texture of daily life, not a matter of slogans or theoretical catch phrases, and they would respond with a number of sensitively nuanced explorations of the subject that are justly celebrated as masterpieces of modern Arabic literature. We are only just beginning to appreciate the true complexity of effect generated by colonialism as a practice on both colonizer and colonized. Clearly, in the case of the Arab world at least, we must also recognize that those effects were registered in different ways at different times, and varied especially in literary discourse by genre. Generalizations are thus impossible. What was a preoccupation of poetry in the 1950s was not what concerned essayists of the same period; novels and drama are equally likely to have followed entirely separate paths, given their special means to represent a variety of speaking voices within the bounds of a single work. This essay is thus only a preliminary excursus into a vast terrain waiting for exploration; to pretend otherwise would be to follow, certainly unwisely, the example of the man with a hammer to whom everything looks like a nail.
