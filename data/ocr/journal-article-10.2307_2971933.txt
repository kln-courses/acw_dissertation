The Association was honored in being the first scientific body invited to meet in the new buildings of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This privilege was keenly appreciated and the opportunity offered to inspect these magnificent buildings embraced by many members. The committee on arrange- ments, under the chairmanship of Professor H. W. Tyler, had made such thorough provisions for anticipating every need of those in attendance that nothing was left to be desired. Special mention should be made of the unique scheme of registration devised by the local committee whereby the names and geographical distribution of all in attendance were exhibited in such a way as to effectively promote mutual acquaintance and friendly intercourse. The opening of the Freshman dormitories of Harvard University for the accommodation of the Association also contributed greatly to the comfort and convenience of the members. An expression of appreciation in regard to all these matters was embodied in a resolution which was unanimously voted at the close of the final session. The dinner on Friday evening at the University Club in Boston was attended by eighty-one persons and was followed by a number of short addresses voicing the felicitations which were evidently in the minds of all with respect to the remarkable progress made by the new Association during the eight months of its history. The speakers were: Professor H. W. Tyler, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Professor M. W. Haskell, University of California; Professor H. B. Fine, Princeton University; Professor T. S. Fiske, Columbia University; Pro- fessor J. L. Coolidge, Harvard University; Professor G. D. Olds, Amherst Col- lege; Professor Helen A. Merrill, Wellesley College; Professor Alexander Ziwet, University of Michigan; and Professor H. E. Slaught, University of Chicago. The remarks of Professor Fiske on the relations between the American Mathe- matical Society and the Mathematical Association of America are printed else- where in this issue. An interesting feature at the dinner was the reading of the following cable- gram from Professor Mittag-Leffler, dated Stockholm, Sweden, August 29, 1916: "Scandinavian mathematicians assembled at Stockholm send fraternal greetings to their American brother mathematicians." In reply, Secretary Cairns was authorized to send the following message: "Members of the Mathematical Association of America reciprocate the hearty greetings of the Scandinavian</page><page sequence="5">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 277 mathematicians." It was explained by Professor D. E. Smith that in a recent letter to Professor Mittag-Leffler he had mentioned the fact that the Association was meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on September first and second, and that the Society would be in session at Harvard University during the week following, and that this cablegram, though addressed to Pro- fessor Moore at the Institute, was evidently intended for both gatherings. On Saturday afternoon thirty-four members accepted the invitation to join in a trip to Wellesley for a visit to the college, dinner at the Wellesley Inn, and return by train in the evening. Other trips were offered on Sunday for those who were to remain over for the meetings of the American Mathematical Society. The following papers and reports were presented, in accordance with the program arranged by the committee under the chairmanship of Professor H. B. Fine of Princeton University: Friday Morning: (1) "The Teaching of Elementary Dynamics." PROFESSOR E. V. HUNT- INGTON, Harvard University. (2) Discussion, led by PROFESSOR L. M. HOSKINS, Stanford University. Friday Afternoon: (3) "The History of Mathematical Recreations." PROFESSOR DAVID EUGENE SMITH, Columbia University. Saturday Morning: (4) " Combined Courses in Mathematics for College Freshmen." PROFESSOR J. N. VAN DER VRIES, University of Kansas. (5) "Combined Courses in Mathematics for Freshmen in Technical Schools." PROFESSOR F. S. WOODS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (6) Discussion, led by PROFESSOR W. D. CAIRNS, Oberlin College and PRO- FESSOR F. L. GRIFFIN, Reed College. (8) " Report of the Committee on Mathematical Requirements." PROFESSOR J. W. YOUNG, Chairman, Dartmouth College. (9) " Report of the Committee on Bureau of Information." PROFESSOR J. B. SHAW, Chairman, University of Illinois. The opportunity for general discussion of Professor Huntington's paper on Friday morning was so limited that a special session was held at the close of the afternoon program, when numerous members took occasion to express their views. Altogether, the interest in this topic was manifest and indicative of a desire for more discussions of this kind. The paper by Professor Smith aroused keen enthusiasm and brought out many expressions of appreciation both at the time and later at the dinner in the evening. Historical topics in connection with mathematics have already won a favorable place in the estimation of members of the Association as desirable program material. The discussions of Saturday morning on "Combined Courses in Mathe- matics" proved exceedingly interesting and fruitful. It seems certain that some form of combined courses for the first year, or first two years, of college work is a</page><page sequence="6">278 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. slogan that is steadily gaining ground, and hence careful consideration at this time is opportune. Many members participated in the general discussion which was continued as long as the time would permit. Abstracts of all the papers and formal discussions are given below, pending fuller reports which may be published later. They are numbered to correspond with the numbers on the program above. Preliminary reports of two important committees were made and these also are given in abstract, in order to indicate some of the lines of work which are already planned for the Association. ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS. (1) In his paper on the teaching of elementary mechanics, Professor Hunt- ington attempted to analyze the logical structure of the science by presenting a list of fundamental concepts in terms of which all the concepts employed in dynamics can be defined, and a list of fundamental theorems from which all the theorems used in dynamics can be deduced. The fundamental concepts are these: (1) Length and time, as measured by a meter stick and a clock; (2) forces, as measured by a spring balance; (3) inert lumps of matter, on which the forces act. The fundamental propositions are the following: (1) The principle of force and acceleration, as expressed in the equation F/F' = a/a'; (2) the principle of the vector addition of forces; (3) the principle of the independence of two per- pendicular forces; (4) the principle of action and reaction. In terms of supporting force, W, and acceleration of falling, g, the funda- mental equation assumes the convenient form F = (Wlg)a, where WIg may -be called the inertia of the body. Among the theorems deducible from these fundamental principles, the most important are the theorem of the motion of the center of mass and the theorem of rotation, by means of which all problems in the plane motion of a rigid body can be solved. Next in importance are the theorem of work and kinetic energy, and the theorems of impulse and momentum (linear and angular). (2) In discussing Professor Huntington's paper, Professor Hoskins spoke in outline as follows: The principles of dynamics may be formulated in various ways, each logically consistent. The effective presentation to the beginner must, however, concern itself not with mere logic; even more important is the physical basis. How can the ordinary experience of the learner be appealed to most effectively in explaining the meaning of the quantities dealt with in the scientific study of motion? In the matter of logical consistency little or no exception can be taken to the procedure of Professor Huntington's paper. As regards the physical concepts of force and mass (or "inertia," as it is called in his paper) the treatment seems to be open to certain objections. There is a traditional treatment of force which encourages the notion that</page><page sequence="7">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 279 forces " manifest themselves " in some vague way independently of matter. It is to be feared that the "anthropomorphic" language used in the paper is calculated to perpetuate this vague metaphysical notion. The best way to remove this vagueness is to emphasize from the outset the fact that a force is merely a push or a pull exerted upon one body by another body, and the further fact that every force is one of an action-reaction pair which concerns two bodies and only two. Professor Huntington's treatment could very easily be amended in this respect without changing the scheme as a whole. The treatment of mass is open to an objection which is more firmly woven into the scheme as outlined. That mass (or inertia as defined in the paper) is an additive property of all matter is a fact so simple as well as so important that it ought to be explicitly recognized as a part of the physical data of the science. The fact that the "inertia" of a body is the sum of the "inertias" of its parts is the key to an understanding of many simple practical problems. Professor Huntington's method does not even recognize the fact that adding matter to a body increases its "inertia" until after an analysis involving internal forces and the law of vector composition is given. The definition of ulnits involves no serious difficulty when the quantities whose units are to be defined are understood. Difficulties of this kind are neither greater nor less in Professor Huntington's scheme than in other schemes to which he objects. (3) The early history of mathematical recreations has not yet been seriously considered. The sources of the problems in the Greek Anthology are practically unknown, and the history of the collection itself offers an interesting field for further study. The same may be said of the Propositiones attributed to Alcuin, for we can hardly assert that a final study has been made of the internal evidence for or against this supposed authorship. Of the printed books on the subject we have no satisfactory bibliography. The Lucas list was the first serious at- tempt, but that is very imperfect and its imperfections were copied along with the correct portions in the Ahrens bibliography. Both Ball and Schubert have valuable notes, but neither makes any claim to completeness. Professor Smith explained the nature of the bibliographical work on which he is engaged. He then laid down several principles upon which these recrea- tions are founded, one of them being that certain problems started as practical ones in the lives of the people and maintained their standing because of the interesting varianits which have arisen from age to age. He then traced the history of four of these stock problems, namely, the pipes and the cistern, the testament, the couriers, and the Turks and Christians. As examples of the bibliographical question he considered the curious history of the work of Leu- rechon, with which are connected the names of Van Etten (pseudonym), Mydorge, Ens, and several others; the history of Bachet de Meziriac's classical work, and that of Ozanam with the elaborate revisions of Montucla and Hutton. (4) Professor Van der Vries in his paper on "Combined Courses in Mathe- matics for College Students" considered three questions:</page><page sequence="8">280 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. I. The advisability of a rearrangement in the order of the content of the high school mathematical course, especially with respect to the first two units; and the probability of such a rearrangement at an early date. II The content and the possible order of a unified course in mathematics for college freshmen based on a rearranged two units of high school mathe- matics. III. The advantages and the disadvantages of parallel courses in mathematics for college freshmen. In Section I was discussed the dissatisfaction with mathematics in general prevalent among public school men and the antagonism on their part, in par- ticular, to the present arrangement of secondary mathematics. The Mathe- matical Association is in a position to lend a hand in the initiation of needed reforms. A rearrangement in the order of the content of high school mathe- matics is suggested as the first step. This rearrangement need not change the sum total of mathematics at the disposal of the high school student who desires more than two units, or who plans to enter an institution requiring more than two units for entrance. It can be accomplished (a) by the postponement of the more complicated problems in algebra, especially those which require much detail and special gifts of ingenuity for their solution, and of those problems in geometry which are not necessary for further work, and in which the reasoning is ultra-abstract; (b) by the introduction of a closer union between plane and solid geometry. The committee of nine of the National Educational Association recommended in 1911 that the requirements in mathematics of a well-planned high school should not exceed two units on a basis of fifteen units for graduation. The 1916 catalogs of one hundred leading colleges and universities of the United States show that forty per cent. require not exceeding two units of high-school mathe- matics for entrance, and this percentage is rapidly increasing. A rearranged two units, as outlined above, will not only better prepare the students entering these institutions than is now the case but will be of much greater value to those students whose mathematical training ends with their two units of high- school work. In rearranging the high-school curricula, there should be kept in mind constantly the three objectives outlined by Professor Gutzmer, of Halle, at the Rome Congress.; namely, A. The strengthening of space perception. B. The introduction of intelligent applications and of correlation with practical work. C. Above all, training in the habit of functional thinking. In Section II was presented a unified course based on the rearranged two units of high-school mathematics suggested in Section 1. The three objectives, A, B, C, above are again constantly kept in mind. Lack of space allows the writer to give here only the merest skeleton. In filling out the gaps in the outline, "the notions of limit, variability, rate, function and graph are so constantly borne in mind that when the calculus as such is introduced in the last section, these notions are met as familiar friends." The main divisions are:</page><page sequence="9">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 281 (a) Introduction and Fundamental Principles. (b) The Linear Function. (c) The Quadratic Function. (d) Algebraic Functions of Degree Higher than Two. (e) Logarithmic and Exponential Functions. (f) Circular Functions, Periodic Functions. (g) Parametric Representation, Implicit Functions, etc. (h) Introduction to the Differential Calculus. The course is planned for five hours per week for one year. In section III was discussed a parallel system in which algebra and trigo- nometry are studied for one semester, algebra on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and trigonometry on Tuesday and Thursday. This work is followed by parallel courses in analytics and calculus for two semesters, analytics two days per week and calculus the remaining three days per week. This system makes provision for a correlation between the parallel courses and for the earlier introduction of the methods of the calculus both of which are desiderata of a unified course. These ends are, however, accomplished without disturbing the lines of demarka- tion between the courses, a very desirable feature from the administrative point of view in the accrediting of courses. The parallel system is thus an intermediate step between the customary courses and unified courses. The advantages and disadvantages of the parallel system were enumerated in the paper. (5) In presenting his outline of a combined course, Professor Woods said that two considerations affect vitally the planning of the first year course in mathe- matics in a technical school. First, the course is only the beginning of a required course of two years or more in length, and, secondly, it must be so planned and taught that the students may learn to use their mathematics. The course in trigonometry may well be retained as a distinct course. This is because in some engineering sQhools it is required for admission, and in others it is voluntarily offered as an admission subject by an increasing number of candidates. Of the work usually given under the titles of advanced algebra and analytic geometry, however, much may be dropped without loss, and the rest placed in the combined course. The result is to make it possible to begin the calculus earlier. On these lines, Professor Woods presented a course of 90 class exercises with- out trigonometry, or 120 exercises with trigonometry, with an ample allowance of time for problem work. It begins with the definition of Cartesian coordinates and is for a while geometrical. It passes then to the calculus through a discussion of slopes and areas and closes with a thorough treatment of differentiation of a function of one variable. The student is introduced to the concept of a definite integral as a limit of a sum and does some simple integration, but a systematic study of integration is postponed to the second year. The discussion of functions of two or more variables and of solid analytic geometry is also postponed. (6) Professor Cairns compared the two types of courses proposed by Pro-</page><page sequence="10">282 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. fessors Van der Vries and Woods with those which had been previously proposed and published in the MONTHLY in December, 1915, and April, 1916, the former by Professor F. L. Griffin, and the latter by Mr. J. A. Nyberg. He spoke of the lethargy among college teachers with respect to considerations of both content and method. He emphasized the desirability of open-minded and critical examination not only of arrangement of courses but also methods of presentation. Professor Cairns would have more concrete teaching at the outset in freshman courses and would introduce the notion of "rate of change" earlier than is done in the outline proposed by the two speakers mentioned above. He would dis- place the more advanced parts of trigonometry, college algebra, and analytic geometry by the inclusion of the simpler parts of integral as well as differential calculus. This last is demanded by the manifold applications which teachers of chemistry, economics, statistics, biology, etc., desire to make in advanced college courses. He pointed out that more than fifty per cent. of colleges and universities offer only three-hour courses in the freshman year, but that even within the field thus narrowed the same choice of subjects and treatment is possible and that the reports of successful experiment along this line are en- couraging. (7) In the absence of Professor Griffin a communication from him was read by Professor Dunham Jackson of the program committee. He mentioned certain disadvantages involved in the plan of teaching trigonometry, college algebra, analytic geometry, hnd calculus separately: (1) The relation of these subjects to each other as parts of a unified whole cannot be seen until several successive courses have been taken. This is en- tirely lost to the student who can take only one year's work. (2) Students of the natural and social sciences, who need increasingly an elementary general knowledge of mathematical analysis, are unable to get it early enough. (3) Even the students specializing in mathematics do not gain facility in drawing upon one subject for help in another. The four-hour course for one year described in the MONTHLY for December, 1915 (the type advocated by Professor Cairns), gives students a fair command of the essential principles and simpler processes of the subjects named. Plane and solid geometry and algebra through quadratics form a prerequisite, although many students have carried the course successfully with less preparation; indeed solid geometry is a luxury rather than a necessity. Trigonometry should be in- cluded in the combination course because trigonometric analysis will mean more there and because this will avoid duplication. Such a course, which may well be available even for the fourth year in the stronger high schools, will meet our obligation to the non-specialist students, and will also be advantageous to the specialists.</page><page sequence="11">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 283 PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MATHEMATICAL REQUIREMENTS. The Committee on Requirements consists of Professor J. W. YOUNG, Chair- man, and Professors A. R. CRATHORNE, E. H. MOOR3E, D. E. SMITH, and OSWALD VEBLEN. The purpose and scope of the work of this committee is indicated in the following list of questions tentatively adopted by the committee as a basis of procedure: I. What general educational values (utilitarian, disciplinary, cultural) can actually be secured by the study of mathematics? II. What should be the primary purposes of mathematical instruction? III. What topics and what treatment of these topics will best serve to realize the values and purposes under I and II? IV. How much of the content included under III should be required (a) of all students in secondary schools; (b) for college entrance; (c) of all students in college? V. What should be the preparation of teachers in secondary schools and in colleges? For the purpose of the discussion as to secondary school mathematics the committee has voted in favor of a national joint committee as requested by the New England Association of Teachers of Mathematics. The specific suggestions of Professor Tyler, who was chairman of the committee on secondary school mathe- matics of the New England Association, as to the method of formation of such a joint committee were also adopted. In accordance with these suggestions, the Committee on Requirements will request the New England Association, the Association of Teachers of Mathematics of the Middle States and Maryland, and the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers each to appoint one representative (who shall be a secondary school teacher), these three to join with the Committee on Requirements of the Mathematical Associa- tion of America to form the national joint committee for the discussion of mathe- matical requirements in secondary schools. The committee voted further to ask Professor H. W. Tyler, of the Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology, to serve as a member of the committee, and Professor Tyler has consented. The committee also voted to ask the Council to authorize it to still further enlarge its personfiel from outside the membership of the Association, if in its opinion such action would serve the best interests of the committee. This authority was subsequently granted by the Council. PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON BUREAU OF INFORMATION. Since this is a new venture in the history of mathematical societies, only a tentative program can be laid down. The Bureau is the outcome of a feeling, on the part of some who have had the opportunity of visiting many teachers of mathematics, that a large part of the profession is handicapped by very inadequate sources of information, and that many questions arise in their work, which can scarcely be answered save through the use of adequately equipped libraries</page><page sequence="12">284 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. which they are not likely to possess. A hesitancy to burden men in the larger institutions generally leaves these questions completely unanswered. Conse- quently it was felt that if a regular Bureau of Information were established to which questions of any character regarding mathematics might be sent (with certain specified exceptions mentioned below) there would ultimately be a great gain to American mathematics. This Bureau has now been established, with the following members, who have volunteered to undertake the labor: Professor J. B. SHAW, Chairman, and Professors J. L. COOLIDGE, L. P. EISENHART, W. B. FITE, M. W. HASKELL, and W. A. HURWITZ. All questions should be sent directly to Professor J. B. Shaw, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois; whence they will be distributed to the committee. The answers will be published if of general interest, otherwise they will be sent by mail to the questioners. The following classes of questions should be sent elsewhere as indicated: (a) All problems, which should go to the problem department. (b) All questions which are merely subjects for discussion, as for instance see page 221 of volume XXIII of the MONTHLY; these should go to the depart- ment of Questions and Discussions. (c) Questions whose answer must be largely only personal opinion; as for instance, "What is the best freshman trigonometry?" See class 7 below. (d) Questions as to courses of reading, lists of new books, and the like, which should go to the Library Committee. (e) Questions of a purely pedagogical character; as, for instance, "When should vector analysis be introduced?" See class 5 below. The following classification of questions proper to be sent to the Bureau is tentative and subject to revision as experience shows the desirability: (1) Explanations of terms used and not generally found in the elementary texts; as, adjunct equation, Heine-Borel theorem, Mathieu function. (2) Explanations of new branches of mathematics, their significance, relation to older branches, references to elementary treatments, references to applications; as orthogonal functions, difference equations, general analysis. (3) Inquiries as to supposed theorems; as, Cauchy's theorem, Green's theorem, Goldbach's theorem. (4) References to treatments of specific topics; as, Abelian groups, theta func- tions, topology, Latin squares, crinkly curves, linkages, non-euclidean sphero-conics. (5) Bibliographical references. The committee will indicate where bibli- ographies of general or special topics may be found, will complete im- perfect references, will indicate the more important memoirs to be con- sulted with reference to given subjects of investigation, and will furnish any other assistance which does not demand too much expenditure of time. (6) Historical references will be indicated so far as possible, although the committee will not undertake categorically to assign priority anywhere.</page><page sequence="13">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 285 (7) Book reviews will be indicated, in order that inquirers may know where to find some information as to a book. (8) The location of journals and other books in the libraries of the country will be indicated, particularly in those libraries which maintain an inter- library loan system. Most institutions of good standing can borrow books for a period of a month by paying the transportation charges. (9) Questions as to the courses offered by the mathematical departments of American and foreign universities will be answered; as for instance, lectures to be given, the prerequisites for admission, conditions to be fulfilled for a degree, method of obtaining scholarships and fellowships, and any other attainable information.- (10) Information as to mathematical societies, congresses, prizes, etc. The Bureau will follow as its standard in references and other matters of form the Encyclopedie des Sciences Mathematiques. MEETING OF INSTITUTIONAL DELEGATES. A meeting of delegates from institutions holding institutional membership in the Association was held on Friday morning. Eighteen institutions partici- pated through their officially appointed delegates as follows: Amherst College, Dean G. D. Olds; Case School of Applied Science, Professor T. M. Focke; University of Chicago, Professor H. E. Slaught; Dartmouth College, Professor J. W. Young; Elmira College, Professor A. H. Norton; George Washington University, Professor H. L. Hodgkins; University of Georgia, Professor R. P. Stephens; Iowa State College, Professor E. W. Stanton; University of Kansas, Professor J. N. Van der Vries; University of Maine, Professor J. N. Hart; University of Michigan, Professor J. L. Markley; Middlebury College, Professor L. R. Perkins; University of Missouri, Professor E. R. Hedrick; Oberlin College, Professor W. D. Cairns; Ohio Wesleyan University, Professor G. N. Armstrong; Washington University, Professor C. A. Waldo; Wellesley College, Professor Helen A. Merrill; Wesleyan University, Professor B. H. Camp. Inasmuch as the purpose of the meeting was to consider the possible questions of an institutional character which such a body of delegates might well discuss, and since many other institutions are considering the desirability of becoming institutional members, it was deemed advisable to invite to this meeting any representatives in attendance from other institutions who might be interested. In this way the following additional institutions were represented: University of Alabama, Boston University, Brown University, Catholic University of America,</page><page sequence="14">286 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. Columbia University, Franklin College, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Nebraska, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Stanford University, Syracuse University, University of Texas, Tufts College, and Yale University. On the basis of suggestions from various members, the following may be stated as some of the reasons why institutional membership is desirable and why the delegates from such institutions might well hold a separate meeting for the discussion of questions of an institutional character: (1) Institutional membership secures two copies of the MONTHLY, one of which can be used in the departmental library or by the local mathematical club for the stimulation of interest among the advanced students and for the dissemination of intelligence concerning mathematical activities throughout the country. (2) Institutional members are entitled to send voting delegates to all meetings of the Association, and such delegates would constitute the constituency inter- ested in discussing the questions of an institutional character, such, for example, as the following: (a) Requirements in mathematics for admission to college and for the Bach- elor's degree. These questions are at present undergoing reconsideration and should have the attention of those who are mathematically qualified to speak with some authority. (b) Changes in the curricula as regards undergraduate courses in mathe- matics. These questions are also undergoing careful consideration, and every institution should be vitally concerned to know what other institutions are doing and why radical modifications are being proposed, such, for example, as the "Combined courses" discussed at this meeting, or the question of intro- ducing the subject of projective geometry as early as the sophomore year, coIn- sidered by Professor Bussey in the November 1913 issue of the MONTHLY. (c) Questions concerning mathematical libraries, such as the best selection of books for a small library, say of 200, 300, or 500 volumes, the best means of purchasing such lists of books, the best methods of administering such libraries in the interests of the students. Advisory pronouncements by this body, after careful consideration, will be of the utmost advantage in enabling the smaller institutions to secure libraries where none now exist or where the existing facilities are entirely inadequate. In this connection the institutional delegates would naturally work with the committee of the Association on libraries already appointed. On motion of Professor J. N. Van der Vries, it was unanimously voted that the institutional delegates should meet as a separate department for the dis- cussion of questions of an institutional character, and that a committee of dele- gates be appointed to prepare such a program for the next meeting, the chairman of this committee to be the -presiding officer at this meeting and one of its members to act as secretary of the meeting. The general impression of those in attendance at this meeting was that there is ample opportunity for wide usefulness through departmental meetings of</page><page sequence="15">FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. 287 institutional delegates, and that it is well worth while for institutions to become members and take part in such meetings. MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE ASSOCIATION. The Council held two meetings, nine members being present on each occasion. The following is an outline of the business transacted. (1) The Council having already voted to hold the annual meeting in New York City during the Christmas holidays, in affiliation with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, it was decided to appoint two com- mittees for this meeting, one on program and one on arrangements. Professor T. S. Fiske has since been asked to act as chairman of the latter committee and has consented to act. The further committee appointments will be announced in the next issue of the MONTHLY. The exact time and place of the meeting was left to be arranged in conference with the committees of the American Associa- tion for the Advancement of Science and the American Mathematical Society. (2) With the approval of the Council, the President has empowered the Committee on Mathematical Requirements to invite certain local associations of teachers of mathematics (See the report of this committee given above) to appoint representatives from their organizations as additional members. This action was taken in response to a suggestion made by the New England Asso- ciation of Teachers of Mathematics through Professor Tyler. The Committee was also empowered to add others to its membership, if it is so desired, from outside the Association. (3) The following eight institutions, on applications duly certified, were elected to institutional membership, making the total number now 61: George Washington University, Washington, D. C. Shurtleff College, Alton, Ill. Drake University, Des Moines, Ia. Wellesley College, Wellesley, Mass. Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H. Elmira College, Elmira, N. Y. New York University, New York, N. Y. State Normal School, La Crosse, Wis. (4) The following thirteen persons, on applications duly certified, were elected to individual membership, making the total number now 1063: Winona M. Perry, Judson College, Marion, Ala. W. A. Moore, Montgomery, Ala. Grace E. Berry, Pomona College, Claremont, Cal. Frank Langellotti, Nautical Almanac Office, Washington, D. C. H. M. Roeser, Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C. P. W. Hill, Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Ind. W. J. Fisher, Honorary Fellow in Physics, Clark University, Worcester, Mass. C. A. Garabedian, New Hampshire State College, Durham, N. H.</page><page sequence="16">288 FIRST SUMMER MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION. W. 0. Wiley, with John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, N. Y. J. A. Hacker, Sioux Falls College, Sioux Falls, S. D. W. E. Boren, State Normal School, Milwaukee, Wis. L. H. Clark, State Normal School, River Falls, Wis. Mary B. McMillan, State Normal School, River Falls, Wis. (5) The Council next considered the report of a committee, consisting of Professor E. H. Moore, Chairman, and Professors R. C. Archibald, Oswald Veblen, and Alexander Ziwet, which was appointed last Spring to consider and report upon the advisability of fostering the production and the publication of articles of an expository and historical nature. In view of the fact that the number of papers of high character at present being produced in this field is small, this committee decided that it would be wise to learn whether an arrangement could be made with the Annals of Mathe- matics, which now publishes such articles, for developing this field. After corre- spondence and conference the committee learned that the Board of Editors of the Annals was willing to enter into an agreement of the nature described below. The proposed agreement provides that, for a period of three years, beginning in September, 1917, in consideration of an annual subvention of three hundred dollars from the Association, the Board of Editors of the Annals will increase the size of the Annals from 200 (its present size) to 300 pages. The added pages will be devoted to expository articles of suitable character so far as these can be secured. The Board of Editors will also fix a subscription price for individual members of the Association to be one-half the ordinary price, which latter would probably be three dollars. Under this agreement the exclusive editorial control of the Annals remains with its present Board of Editors, but the Board agrees to make no change in its present policy without conference and agreement with the committee repre- senting the Association. At the end of the three-year period this agreement may be renewed by the consent of both parties; but if not, it is agreed that the Board of Editors of the Annals shall thereafter conduct the Annals as a journal devoted p-rimarily to research, yielding the field of historical and expository articles (not necessarily absolutely but principally) to the publications of the Association. The committee recommended that this proposed agreement be ratified and adopted by the Association. After careful consideration, the Council voted unani- mously to submit this agreement to the members of the Association through the official journal, in accordance with the provisions of Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution. This agreement will go into effect only if ratified by the Council after the views of members of the Association have been ascertained in accordance with that provision.
