<plain_text><page sequence="1">Symbol According to Cassirer and Langer II. — LANGER'S THEORY OF ART A. - General Theory Though Cassirer frequently indicateci art as one of the principal symbolic forms, he never worked out this part of his general philosophy. For a complementary treatment of art and the artistic symbol we may turn to the work of Susanne Langer. In this account of Langer's philosophy of art, I shall use her three major works: Philosophy in a New Key, Feeling and Form, and Mtnd172. Of these, Feeling and Form is the most significant for our present concern. Although her treat ment of art regards several particular art forms without devel oping a general theory, I have attempted to gather from her books those general notions which run through her work, and I shall set these forth first, to avoid endless repetition and fragmentary treatment in the consideration of particular art forms. This sketch of a « general theory », then, does not represent her effort at synthesis, nor is it a rigorously systematic treatment. To avoid going beyond Langer's own thought in this exposition, I am limiting myself to gathering and putting in some reasonable order a number of elements which overlap at times, and which do not constitute a tight, coherent theo retical account. After this effort at setting forth some of the common notions, I shall indicate some particular elaborations in Langer's treatment of art forms which afford most helpful i72I shall cite Langer's works as follows: PhNK = Philosophy in a New Key (New York: The New American Library [Mentor Bookl, c. 1951); FF = Feeling and Form (New York: Scribner's, c. 1953); Μ = Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, Voi.

(1) Expression of insight. «...The artistic symbol, qua artistic, negotiates insight... »173 A symbol « ... is used to artico late ideas of something we wish to think about, and until we have a fairly adequate symbolism we cannot think about it... »174 For example, « ... the function of music is not stimulation of feeling, but expression of it; and furthermore, not the symp tomatic expression of feelings that beset the composer but a symbolic expression of the forms of sentience as he understands them... »175 As an image, a symbol, the work of art is the bearer of an idea 17e. « ... [What] art expresses is not actual feeling, but ideas of feeling;... »177 Consequently, the import of a work of art can by known by the most basic intellectual act of intuition or insight178. (2) Significant form, abstraction, image, semblance, and related concepts. Langer has not worked out a full theory of the artistic symbol. In Feeling and Form, whose subtitle is « A Theory of Art Developed from Philosophy in a New Key, » the many particular art forms are treated, but no general theory is attempted. Even in Mind, though she attempts some gen eralization of the results of the analysis done in Feeling and Form, her treatment of abstraction, for instance, fails to pro duce a clear formulation179. In the present section I shall present a number of connected, and to some extent over lapping, notions hearing on the production and the distinctive characteristics of artistic forms. I reserve for separate treat 173 FF, 22. FF, 28. 175 FF, 28 (my italics); cf. Μ, xv: « ...I was led to the concepì of art as the symbolic expression of an artist's knowledge of feeling... » (my italics). 176 FF, 47. 777 FF, 59. 178 FF, 375. For Langer the terms intuition and insight are equivalent: cf. FF, 378: « ...Ali cognition of form is intuitive; ali relatedness—distinct ness, congruence, correspondence of forms, contrast, and synthesis in a total Gestalt—can be known only by direct insight, which is intuition. And not only form, but formai significance, or import, is seen intuitively (wherefore it is sometimes said to be « felt »), or not at ali; that is the basic symbolic value which probably precedes and prepares verbal mean ing ».

Significant form is the essence of every art18°. It is « ... an articulate expression of feeling, reflecting the verbally ineffable and therefore unknown forms of sentience... »181 « ... Art is the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling »182. A work of art is a creation, not a mere production: it « ... is more than an ' arrangement ' of given things — even qualitative things. Something emerges from the arrangement of tones or colors which was not there before, and this, rather than the arranged material, is the symbol of sentience »183. A complex symbol, such as a sentence, a map, or a work of music, is an articulate form, whose characteristic symbolic function is logicai expression. « ... It expresses relations; and it may ' mean ' — connote or denote — any complex of ele ments that is of the same articulate form as the symbol, the form which the symbol ' expresses ' »184. The secret of the beauty of a work of art is its expressìve form\ as soon as we fìnd it beautiful, « ... we have grasped its expressiveness, and until we do we have not seen it as good art.... Beauty is expressìve. form » 185 Thus, for example, the real source of the deep satisfaction in tragedy, is the joy of revelation, the vision of a world wholly significant. « ... It is simply the joy of great art, which is the perception of created form wholly expressìve, that is to say, beautiful »18e. Abstraction is the process, or cluster of processes, by which significant form is created. A work of art is detached from the rest of the world. It creates an impression of « otherness » from reality, an illusion, the air of being a sheer image187. The essential power of such an image is not its imitation of other things, but rather its being an abstraction, a symbol, 180 FF, 24. "ι FF, 39. 182 FF, 40. 183 FF, 40. 181 FF, 30-31. « ...The symbol and the object symbolized must have some common logicai form » (FF, 27).

The work of art becomes an image when, for example, it presente itself to vision as a sheer visual form instead of a locally and practically related object: it is simply a thing of vision, detached from its actual setting and given a different context. The image thus existing only for perception, abstracted from the physical and causai order, is the artist's creation18S. Abstraction gives the form otherness, self-sufficiency, by creating a realm of illusion, in which the form functions as an appearance, a mere semblance, free from worldly offices 169. Abstraction requires transformation, for it is the sameness of logicai structure in experientially different loci that makes the form apparent 19°. « The artist's most elementary problem is the symbolic transformation of subjec tively known realities into objective semblances that are im mediately recognized as their expression in sensory appear ances ... »1M. Whereas abstraction in science is effected by successive generalizations, it is achieved in art without any such intel lectual steps. « ... The only way to make the feeling-content of a design, a melody, a poem, or any other art symbol public, is to present the expressive form so abstractly and forcibly that anyone with normal sensitivity for the art in question will see this form and its ' emotive quality '... » 192 « ... Art does not generalize and classify; art sets forth the individuality of forms which discourse, being essentially general, has to sup press.

Discussing the artist's idea, Langer asks: « ... how does the artist transform his idea of feeling — which must be vagué, elusive, amorphous before it appears in any projec tion — into the objective datum, the perceptible quality of a poem, a musical piece, a painting or whatever else he gives us? How does he envisage that quality before he or anyone else has seen it? « The answer is, I think, that he has seen it; it is this apparition that he tries to re-create. His idea is initiated by experiences, or perhaps even one isolated experience, of ac tuality colored by his own way of feeling (rather than by some emotion of the moment), and the image he creates is of the way things appear to his imagination under the influence of his highly developed emotional life ... »197 The artist tries to re-create a quality which he has knowm « ... When he finds a theme that excites him, it is because he thinks that in his rendering of it he can endow it with some such quality, which is really a way of feeling. That process is the abstractive process of art. It is true that, as one aesthetician after another has declared and stressed, an artist at his work does not think abstractly; but he thinks abstrac tively. He does not use the ready-made general concepts of ordinary discourse to reason verbally about his work — which is what they mean by ' thinking abstractly ' — to any great extent; but he is entirely absorbed in making a new abstraction, without the aid of that spontaneous, progressive generalization which is the normal machinery of intellectual abstract con ception... »198 195 FF, 348. 196 FF, 373-374. 197 Μ, 117-118. 198 Μ, 118-119. Langer cites her further treatment of abstractive methods In Problems of Art (New York: Scribner's, 1957), in the appendix entitled « Abstraction in Science and Abstraction in Art, » and in Philo sophical Sketches (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1962), No. 3, « On a New Definition of Symbol. »</page><page sequence="6">620 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. In her efforts to give a general account of artistic ab straction, Langer calls it presentational or metaphorical19e, or presentational with many subspecies: isolating, metaphorical, secondary, transcending, « ... and perhaps others for which one could invent suggestive names ... » 200 Farther in on the same discussion she refers to the gestalt principle of abstraction: « ... a principle inherent in perception itself, which organizes the impinging sensations spontaneously into large units: the tendency to closure of form, to simplifìcation ... »201 Isolating abstraction is also called abstraction by emphasis 202. Of ali these « subspecies » of presentational abstraction, Langer treats metaphorical abstraction most fully. She notes the linguistic fact that commonly the same words are used for both physical qualities or acts and mental or moral ones 203. According to a common interpretation of this fact, words with a literal physical meaning are borrowed to express metaphor ically intellectual or moral qualities or acts. Langer fìnds another explanation: ... On grounds of more general phylogenetic patterns it is at least as reasonable to suppose that the light of the sun and the light of reason or of joy were named by the same word because they were charged with the same feeling, and consequently taken as the same thing, and that their distinct characters only showed up in language in the course of its logicai development. The physical meaning became the « literal » one because it was the most public and therefore socially the most negotiable one. Physical light is a permanent, ever-available symbol for everything that « light » may have meant in its earliest uses, which were probably quite spontaneous applications to a large vague class of things similarly felt... Knowledge begins, then, with the formulation of expe rience in many haphazard ways, by the imposition of 19» Μ, 128. 200 Μ, 156-157. 2οι Μ, 164. 202 Μ, 166. 203 Μ, 180; 62. «...We speak of thoughts as ' heavy ' or ' light, ' ' shallow ' or ' deep, ' and of ' bald ' statement and ' sharp ' wits. Even terms for mental acts such as ' insight, ' ' foresight, ' ' reflection ' and ' rumination ' fall into the category of borrowings from the physical realm » (M, 62).</page><page sequence="7">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 621 available images on new experiences as fast as they arise; it is a process of imagining not fictitious things, but reality...204 A striking factor in this process is sensuous metaphor, « ... the symbolic equivalence of sensations ... »205 which have a common emotive character The linguistic fact here is the change of sense which words undergo in the course of history. One type of change is « ... the shift of meanings in words denoting sensory qualities, which seems to be based on a principle of truly spontaneous sensuous metaphor, and finally to take a turn which reveals a mode of abstraction developed only in works of art »2&lt;ì7. One example is the shift of color words from one specific hue to another. In a different order the same word « bright » shifts from sight to sound to intellectual comprehensibility or clarity. The same principle governs both types of shift: the hues in question, or the diverse kinds of brightness, seem to convey the same feeling20S. It is by the unconscious use of sensuous metaphor that language expands as expansion is needed: ... Apparently the words which lend themselves most readi ly to metaphorical uses are those which denote light, heat, movement, or faintness, dullness, also pain and threat... Ali these words either have direct application to mental states and acts, or have dose cognates that are obvious extensions to psychical phenomena. It ap pears that light, smoothness and especially movement are the naturai symbols of life, freedom and joy, as darkness and immobility, roughness and hardness are the symbols of death and frustration. Those perceptual impressions which are intuitively received as expressive lend their names quite spontaneously to conceptions of feelings, and at the same time exchange them among themselves20fl. «14 Μ. 62-63. In an earlier treatment of metaphor Langer seems to follow the other interpretation : PhNK, 118-130. 205 m, 230. Langer simply puts this phrase in apposition with « sensuous metaphor. » Perhaps one could suggest a further clarification consistent with her thought: sensuous metaphor t's based upon the symbolic equivalence of sensations having a common emotive character. 2oe m, 186. so?

Understandably, in this context Langer uses the term « emotive abstraction », without calling particular attention to it 21°. Finally, sensuous metaphor is involved in a further phe nomenon, involving a different intuition and consequently a different abstraction: Many words of « roots » denoting qualities give rise not only to ali sorts of derivative terms involving those quali ties, but by further departure produce cognates wherein the originai connotation is more and more attenuated, ending up in its exact opposite... The guiding principle of such changes is an aspect of conceptual thinking which no conventional symbolism can express: the fact that every primitive concept arises and exists in an area of relevance, ranging from its own logicai domain to its converse domain, and including ali conceptions lying between these extremes. The roots of language usually convey ideas of felt experience, i.e. either of action or of impact, and feeling is good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, with a continuum between them, which, taken from either end, somewhere (not necessarily half way) breaks over into its opposite. Sensuously, the change of cathexis usually corresponds to changes of intensity, from too faint to satisfy, to too intense to bear. In every sensory experience there is the threat of evanescence and the threat of intolerability, and the precarious balance between them is implicit in every moment of perfection. A sensible quality, therefore, gives into the artist's hand the whole range of feeling it can express, even the exis tence of that range itself 21\ For the moment, we may be content with these elements contributing to some general conception of artistic abstraction according to Langer. Some further details will appear both from her treatment of the correlative terminology for the artistic symbol, and from her discussion of particular art forms. Turning now from the process of abstraction to the symbol which is its produci, we may note a number of related notions concerning the art symbol: image, semblance, virtual form, living form, and illusion. 210 Μ, 195. 211 Μ, 195-197.</page><page sequence="9">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 623 An image is different from a model, and serves a different purpose. Briefly stated, an image shows how something appears; a model shows how something works. The art symbol, therefore, sets forth in symbolic projection how vital and emotional and intellectual tensions appear, i.e., how they feel...212 ... Feeling is a dynamic pattern of tremendous complexity. Its whole relation to life, the fact that ali sorts of pro cesses may culminate in feeling with or without direct regard to each other, and that vital activity goes on at ali levels continuously, make mental phenomena the most protean subject matter in the world. Our best identifìca tion of such phenomena is through images that hold and present them for our contemplation; and their images are works of art. What makes a work important is not the category of its expressed feeling, which may be obvious or, on the con trary, impossible to name, but the articulation of the experiential form. In actual felt activity the form is elusive, for it collapses into a condensed and foreshort ened memory almost as fast as the experience passes; to hold and contemplate it requires an image which can be held for contemplation. But there is no simple image of our inner dynamisms as there is of visually perceived forms and colors and of sound patterns. A symbol capable of articulating the forms of feeling is, therefore, necessarily presented in some sort of projection as an extraorganic structure that conveys the movement of emotive and perceptive processes. Such a projection is a work of art. It presents the semblance of feeling so directly to logicai intuition that we seem to perceive feeling itself in the work; but of course the work does not contain feeling, any more than a proposition about the mortality of Socrates contains a philosopher. It only presents a form which is subtly but entirely congruent with forms of mentality and vital experience, which we recognize intuitively as something very much like feeling; and this abstract likeness to feeling teaches one, without effort or explicit awareness, what feeling is like213. The art symbol is an image, not a model. An image ab stracts the semblance of its object, and makes one aware of what is there for direct perception...214 212 Μ, xix. 213 Μ, 67 (my italics). 214 Μ, 67-68 (my italics).</page><page sequence="10">624 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. ... The setting forth of pure quality, or semblance, creates a new dimension, apart from the familiar world. That is its office. In this dimension, ali artistic forms are conceived and presented. Since their substance is illu sion or « Schein » they are, from the standpoint of prac tical reality, mere forms; they exist only for the sense or the imagination that perceives them — like the fata morgana, or the elaborate, improbable structure of events in our dreams. The function of « semblance » is to give forms a new embodiment in purely qualitative, unreal instances, setting them free from their normal embodiment in real things so that they may be recognized in their own right, and freely conceived and composed in the interest of the artist's ultimate aim — significance, or logicai expression. Ali forms in art, then, are abstracted forms; their content is only a semblance, a pure appearance, whose function is to make them, too, apparent — more freely and wholly apparent than they could be if they were exemplifìed in a context of real circumstance and anxious interest. It is in this elementary sense that ali art is abstract. Its very substance, quality without practical significance, is an abstraction from material existence; and exempli fication in this illusory or quasi-illusory medium makes the forms of things (not only shapes, but logicai forms, e.g. proportions among degrees of importance in events, or among different speeds in motions) present them selves in abstracto ...215 At times at least in Langer's usage, image, semblance, and virtual object or virtual form are equivalent terms. An image is, indeed, a purely virtual ' object '. Its importance lies in the fact that we do not use it to guide us to something tangible and practical, but treat it as a complete entity with only visual attributes and relations. It has no others; its visible character is its entire being »21β. Though the word « image » of itself suggests something visual, there is a broader sense of « image » which is aptly conveyed by the word « semblance »2".

Such form is ' liv ing ' in the same way that a border or a spirai is intrinsically ' growing that is, it expresses life — feeling, growth, move ment, emotion, and everything that characterizes vital exis tence... »219 « Pure decorative design is a direct projection of vital feeling into visible shape and color. Decoration may be highly diversified, or it may be very simple; but it always has what geometrie form, for instance a specimen illustration in Euclid, does not have — motion and rest, rhythmic unity, wholeness. Instead of mathematical form, the design has — or rather, it is — ' living ' form, though it need not represent anything living...»220 [In the non-temporal arts, the] ... life of feeling is shown in timeless projection. Only art, which creates its ele ments instead of taking them from the world, can exhibit tension and resolution simultaneously, through the illu sion of « space-tensions » and « space-resolutions ». But, although a work of art may abstract from the tem poral character of existence, what it renders in its own logicai projection must be true in design to the structure of experience. That is why art seems essentially organic; for ali vital tension patterns are organic patterns. It must be remembered, of course, that a work of art is not an actual organism, but presents only the appearance of life, growth, and functional unity...221 ... works of art exhibit the morphology of feeling...222 Appearing detached from its physical environment, the work of art creates an impression of « otherness », of an illusion enfolding the things, action, statement, or flow of sound that constitutes the work: the illusion of being a sheer image 223. 219 FF, 82 (Langer's italics). 220 FF, 63 (I have italicized vital feeling). 221 FF, 373 (my italics). Cf. from a passage already quoted: « [what the work of art] ... conveys is really just one nameless passage of ' felt life, ' knowable through its incarnation in the art symbol even if the beholder has never felt it in his own flesh » (FF, 374). 222 M, 100. 222 FF, 45; cf. 59.</page><page sequence="12">626 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. ... Where we know that an « object » consists entirely in its semblance, that apart from its appearance it has no cohesion and unity — like a rainbow, or a shadow — we cali it a merely virtual object, or an illusion. In this literal sense a picture is an illusion; we see a face, a flower, a vista of sea or land, etc., and know that if we stretched out our hand to it we would touch a surface smeared with paint. The object is given only to the sense of sight. That is the chief purpose of « imitation », or « objective » painting. To present things to sight which are known to be an illusion is a ready (though by no means necessary) way to abstract visible forms from their usuai context 224. Although there is a unity of art, based on the logie of non-discursive form which is common to ali arts, they are differentiated by their primary illusion 226 : The fact that the primary illusion of one art may appear, like an echo, as a secondary illusion in another, gives us a hint of the basic community of ali the arts. As space may suddenly appear in music, time may be involv ed in visual works. A building, for instance, is the incarna tion of a vital space; in symbolizing the feeling of the life that belongs to its precincts, it inevitably shows us time, and in some buildings this element becomes impres sively strong. Yet architecture does not create a percep tible totality of time, as it does of space; time is a secondary illusion. The primary illusion always determines the « substance », the real character of an art work, but the possibility of secondary illusions endows it with the richness, elasticity, and wide freedom of creation that make real art so hard to hold in the meshes of theory22e. The virtual world in which poetic events develop is always peculiar to the work; it is the particular illusion of life those events create, as the virtual space of a picture is the particular space of the forms in it.... For the primary illusion of literature, the semblance of life, is abstracted from immediate, personal life, as the primary illusions of the other arts — virtual space, time, and power — are images of perceived space, vital time, felt power 227. 224 FF, 49 (my italics). 225 FF, 103. 226 FF, 118. 227 FF, 217 &lt;my italics).</page><page sequence="13">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 627 Correlative to the primary illusion of an art, there is its basic abstraction. Thus, in the case of literature, virtual events are the basic abstraction, by means of which the illusion of life is made and sustained and given specifìc, articulated forms 228. (3) The non-discursive symbol. Ali art symbols are dif ferentiated sharply by their non-discursive character, as op posed to the symbolic form of discursive language. The language of ordinary, practical communication, or of scientifìc knowledge, or of philosophical thought, is discursive: its purpose is discourse, and the conceptual framework that has developed under its influence is cali « discursive reason » 229. In language, separate words are assigned to separately con ceived items on the basis of a simple one-to-one correlation. A word, or a combination of words used as one, is assigned to mean an object taken as one. Further, words denoting different things are used in combinations effected according to the principles of grammar and syntax, and something is expressed by the way they are combined. The elements of propositions are named by words, but propositions are articu lated by sentences. As a complex symbol, the sentence is an articulate form, which expresses relations 23°. The intellectual vocabulary grows with the progress of conceptual thinking and civilized living. Technical ad vances make demands on our language which are met by the elaboration of mathematical, logicai, and scientifìc terminologies. Anthropomorphic metaphors are banned, and the philological laws of word-change become almost all-important in the production of further nomenclatures and usages. Meanings become more and more precise; ... Speech becomes increasingly discursive, practical, pro sale, until human beings can actually believe that it was invented as a utility, and was later embellished with metaphors for the sake of a cultural product called poetry231. Discursive language has its own law of projection, a linear, discrete, successive order, which is the source of both its unique power and its severe limitations. 228 FF, 217. 229 FF, 29. 230 FF, 30-31; PhNK, 66-67, 122-123; M, 102. «ai M, 102.</page><page sequence="14">628 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. The most salient characteristic of discourse is that its symbolization of concepìs is held to one dominant projec tion, which enables users of words to « run through » elaborate combinations of them, building up meanings by accretion. Other expressive devices may fìnd their way into the pattern of discourse, but they are contingent to the basic pattern, and their sense is very aptly said to be « between the lines ». The « lines » of discourse are propositional constructions; other accepted forms, which are not strictly propositional — interrogative, im perative, vocative — are auxiliary forms developed in use. The essence of language is statement 231\ ...words have a linear, discrete, successive order; they are strung one after another like beads on a rosary; beyond the very limited meanings of inflections, which can indeed be incorporated in the words themselves, we cannot talk in simultaneous bunches of names. We must name one thing and then another, and symbols that are not names must be stuck between or before or after, by convention ...232 ... This property of verbal symbolism is known as discur siveness; by reason of it, only thoughts which can be arranged in this peculiar order can be spoken at ali; any idea which does not lend itself to this « projection » is ineffable, incommunicable by means of words. That it why the laws of reasoning, our clearest formulation of exact expression, are sometimes known as the « laws of discursive thought » 233. Language is powerful, for by it we can form abstract concepts, combine them in propositions, apply these to the world of perception and action, making it a world of « facts », and manipulate them by the process of reasoning. This power comes from the singleness of its discursive projection. Ideally the words used should be as unequivocal as possible. Scientific terminology assures this for precise, abstract discourse. In other usage, context can reveal the « strict sense »234. Yet the same characteristics which give language its power also set limits to its expressive power: *«■ Μ, 102. 232 PhNK, 76. 233 PhNK, 77. 234 Μ, 102-103; cf. 155-156.</page><page sequence="15">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 629 ... It is clumsy and ali but useless for rendering the forms of awareness that are not essentially recognition of facts, though facts may have some connection with them. They are perceptions of our own sensitive reactions to things inside and outside of ourselves, and of the fabric of tensions which constitutes the so-called « inner life » of a conscious being. The constellations of such events are largely non-linear, for where sequences occur they nor mally occur simultaneously with others, and every tension between two poles affects (evokes, modifies, cancels or precludes ab initio) many concomitant ones having other poles. The tensions of living constitute an organic pattern, and those which rise to a psychical phase — that is to say, felt tensions — can be coherently apprehended only in so far as their whole non-psychical organic background is implied by their appearance. That is why every work of art has to seem « organic » and « living » to be expres sive of feeling. Its elements, like the dynamic elements in nature, have no existence apart from the situations in which they arise; but where they exist they tend to figure in many relationships at once23δ. Non-discursive form differs in many ways from discursive linguistic form. First, there is an immediate contrast regarding some of the most evident characteristics of language. (1) Lan guage has vocabulary and syntax: words with definite meanings, and rules for the construction of composite symbols with new meanings. (2) Since some words are equivalent to whole com binations of words, it is possible to define the meanings of words and to establish a dictionary. (3) Since there may be alternative words for the same meaning, and whole systems of words in different languages, it is possible to translate from one system to the other. In ali these respects, non-discursive symbolic forms differ. (1) Al though the non-discursive symbol is composed of elements, it cannot be broken up into basic units with independent meanings: it has no vocabulary, and though there is a technique of creating forms by combination, that technique is not properly a « syntax ». (2) Since there are no elements with independent meanings, there can be no dictionary of meanings for the elements of a work of art: non-discursive symbols cannot be defined in terms of other 235 Μ, 103; cf. PhNK, 77.</page><page sequence="16">630 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. symbols, as discursive symbols can. (3) It is impossible to translate a non-discursive symbol23e. Whereas words in discursive symbols have general reference, non-discursive symbols, speaking directly to the sense, have no intrinsic generality. The non-discursive symbol is a direct presentation of an individuai object 237. Feeling and emotion are complexes of tension, and every affective experience is a uniquely determined process of this sort. Consequently, every work of art, being an image of such a complex, should express a particular feeling unambiguously. It conveys « ... one nameless passage of ' felt life knowable through its incarnation in the art symbol... » 238. The laws which govern artistic creation are not those of discursive logie. They are laws of a kind of thought different from scientific or practical reasoning. « ... They are, in fact, the laws of imagination. As such they extend over ali the arts, but literature is the field where their differences from discursive logie become most sharply apparent, because the artist who uses them is using linguistic forms, and thereby the laws of discourse, at the same time, on another semantic level. This has led critics to treat poetry indiscriminately as both art and discourse ... » 239. « The laws of combination, or ' logie of purely aesthetic forms — be they forms of visible space, audible time, living forces, or experience itself — are the fundamental laws of imagination. They were recognized long ago by poets, who praised them as the wisdom of the heart (much superior to that of the head), and by mystics who believed them to be the laws of ' reality '... The cardinal principle of imaginative projection is what Freud calls Darstellbarkeit, which ... I shall ... translate as ' exhibitable '. Every product of imagination — be it the intelligently organized work of an artist, or the spon taneous fabrication of a dreamer — comes to the percipient as an experience, a qualitative direct datum. And any emotional import conveyed by it is perceived just as directly; that is why poetic presentation is often said to have an ' emotional quality ' » 24°. 23β phNK, 87-88. 237 PhNK, 88-89. 238 FF, 373-374. 239 FF, 234. 240 FF, 241.</page><page sequence="17">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 631 What has been said concerning the power and the limita tions of discursive form suggests a further difference from non-discursive form: Non-discursive form in art has a different office, namely to articulate knowledge that cannot be rendered discur sively because it concerns experiences that are not formally amenable to the discursive projection. Such experiences are the rhythms of life, organic, emotional and mentili (the rhythm of attention is an interesting link among them ali), which are not simply periodic, but endlessly complex, and sensitive to every sort of influence. Ali to gether they compose the dynamic pattern of feeling. It is this pattern that only non-discursive symbolic forms can present, and that is the point and purpose of artistic construction 241. A further characteristic of non-discursive form is over determination or ambivalence: the same form may have more than one import. Whereas a word having different meanings is limited to one of them by the context of discourse, there is no such limitation of non-discursive form. The pure percep tible form is limited by nothing but the formai structure itself. Consequently, meanings which in rational discourse could be only alternatives are simply present together in the import of art. Langer believes that « ... the power of artistic forms to be emotionally ambivalent springs from the fact that emo tional opposites — joy and grief, desire and fear, and so forth — are often very similar in their dynamic structure, and reminis cent of each other. Small shifts of expression can bring them together, and show their intimate relations to each other, whereas literal description can only emphasize their sepa rateness »242. Condensation is another feature closely related to over determination, yet distinct from it: « ... it is essentially a fusion of forms themselves by intersection, contraction, elision, sup pression, and many other devices. The effect is usually to intensify the created image, heighten the ' emotional quality often to make one aware of complexities of feeling... » 243. 2« FF, 240-241; cf.

An artistic symbol is a much more intricate thing than what we usually think of as a form, because it involves ali the relationships of its elements to one another, ali similarities and differences of quality, not only geometrie or other familiar relations. That is why qualities enter directly into the form itself, not as its contente, but as constitutive elements in it.... a work of art is a structure whose interrelated elements are often qualities, or prop erties of qualities such as their degrees of intensity; ... qualities enter into the form and in this way are as much one with it as the relations which they, and only they, have; ... to speak of them as « content », from which the form could be abstracted logically, is nonsense. The form is built up out of relations peculiar to them; they are formai elements in the structure, not contente 244. Implicit in much of what has been said is the simultaneity of non-discursive form. Many aspeets of the import of an art symbol could be conceived intellectually only successively. In the visual arts we see them, in the poetic art we understand them, and in music we hear them simultaneously. « ... That is a fundamental fact of artistic structure, and one of its dif ferences from discursive form. Within a work of art this sets up a level of deeper tensions than those which we perceive as such: a permanent tonicity, which pervades the work and is the most elementary source of its apparent life, or ' liv ingness ' » 245. Whereas language is a symbolism, a system of symbols, a work of art is a prime symbol: A work of art is a single, indivisible symbol, although a highly articulated one; it is not, like a discourse (which may also be regarded as a single symbolic form), com posite, analyzable into more elementary symbols — sen tences, clauses, words, and even separately meaningful parts of words: roots, prefìxes, suffixes, etc.; selected, arranged and permutable according to publicly known « laws of language ». For language, spoken or written is a symbolism, a system of symbols; a work of art is always a prime symbol. It may, indeed, be analyzed, in that its articulation may be traced and various elements in it 244 FF, 51-52. 2« Μ, 175; cf. 103.</page><page sequence="19">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 633 distinguished; but it can never be constructed by a process of synthesis of elements, because no such elements exist outside it. They only occur in a total form...2VS. When these characteristics of the non-discursive art symbol are considered, it is clear why it is called a presentational symbol. It is a symbol without intrinsic generality. It presents directly an individuai object. Ali of the elements which con stitute this symbol are involved in a simultaneous, integrai presentation247. « ... Just as the content of discourse is the discursive concept, so the content of a work of art is the non-discursive concept of feeling; and it is directly expressed by the form, the appearance before us ... » 24S. Another apt name for such a symbol is metaphorical: « ... A work of art is like a metaphor, to be understood without translating or comparison of ideas; it exhibits its form, and the import is immediately perceived in it. So far, I have always called its characteristic symbolic mode simply ' non-discursive but there are other non-discursive symbols, such as maps and plans, which have not the organic structure or the implicit significance of art. One might well cali a work of art a meta phorical symbol. « It is, however, not a simple metaphor, but a highly elaborated one, even though it may seem the simplest of compositions; for its elements are articulated to various degrees, their sense is one thing in one of their internai relations and something else in another » 249. Finally, we may note further Langer's insistence on a characteristic already indicated in passing: the art symbol is untranslatable. With regard to music, it expresses what is unspeakable in verbal language. « Because the forms of human feeling are much more congruent with musical forms than with the forms of language, music can reveal the nature of feelings with a detail and truth that language cannot approach... » 25°. Not only music, however, but ali art is « ... formally and es 2« FF, 369. 247 PhNK, 89. 248 FF, 82. 249 M, 104-105. 25» PhNK, 199.</page><page sequence="20">634 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. sentially untranslatable... »251. The sense of art symbols is bound to the particular form which it has taken: ... This is true even of poetry, for though the material of poetry is verbal, its import is not the literal assertion made in the words, but the way the assertion is made, and this involves the sound, the tempo, the aura of as sociations of the words, the long or short sequences of ideas, the wealth or poverty of transient imagery that contains them, the sudden arrest of fantasy by pure fact, or of familiar fact by sudden fantasy, the suspense of literal meaning by a sustained ambiguity resolved in a long-awaited key-word, and the unifying, all-embracing artifice of rhythm.... The poem as a whole is the bearer of artistic import, as a painting or drama is.... The material of poetry is discursive, but the product — the artistic phenomenon — is not; its significance is purely implicit in the poem as a totality, as a form compounded of sound and sug gestion, statement and reticence, and no translation can reincarnate that... 252. B. - Some Particular Art Forms Unable to follow Langer's account of ali the arts, I pass over her very interesting discussion of the plastic arts, dealing with virtual space in various modes: pictorial art, sculpture, and architecture 253. I shall present elements from her account of music, dance, lyric poetry, and drama. These offer very interesting and widely varied illustrations of her general no tions, and afford bases for helpful comparisons in the develop ment of an eventual theory of the Christian sacrament as a symbol. (1) Music. Music is a «tonai analogue of emotive life ». In it there are tonai structures which « ... bear a dose logicai similarity to the forms of human feeling — forms of growth and of attenuation, flowing and stowing, conflict and resolu tion, speed, arrest, terrific excitement, cairn, or subtle activa 251 Ibid. 252 PhNK, 220-221. 253 cf. FF, chapters 5 and 6.</page><page sequence="21">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 635 tion and dreamy Iapses — not joy and sorrow perhaps, but the poignancy of either and both — the greatness and brevity and eternai passing of everything vitally felt. Such is the pattern, or logicai form, of sentience; and the pattern of music is that same form worked out in pure, measured sound and silence... » 254. Music is a symbolic expression of sentience, or « inner life », as understood 255, of complexes of feelings that language cannot even name256. Music is an expression of insight into such feeling 257. Music introduces the hearer into a universe of pure sound, an audible world, a sonorous beauty taking over the whole of his consciousness 258. The elements of music are not tones of such and such pitch, duration, and loudness, not chords and measured beats. They are something virtual, created for perception: sounding forms in motion 259. Unlike physical dis placement, musical motion is a pure semblance 2β0. The move ment of tonai entities in music occurs in a realm of pure duration, which differs from the time which measures our public and private life, and which is consequently incommen surable with the progress of common affairs. « ... Musical dura tion is an image of what might be termed ' lived ' or ' ex perienced ' time — the passage of life that we feel as expecta tions become ' now ', and ' now ' turns into unalterable fact. Such passage is measurable only in terms of sensibilities, ten sions, and emotions; and it has not merely a different measure, but an altogether different structure from practical or scientific time »2el. « The semblance of this vital, experiential time is the primary illusion of music. Ali music creates an order of virtual time, in which its sonorous forms move in relation to each other — always and only to each other, for nothing else exists there. Virtual time is as separate from the sequence of actual 254 FF, 27; cf. 32; cf. also PhNK, 178, 192-193. 255 FF, 28; cf.

I. happenings as virtual space from actual space... »262. The essence of music is the creation of virtual time263. The essence of ali musical composition is the semblance of organic movement, for music is a symbol which expresses feeling, and feeling exists only in living organisms. The logie of symbols expressing insight into feeling, therefore, is the logie of organic processes, and the most characteristic principle of vital activity is rhythm: « ... the preparation of a new event by the ending of a previous one... »26 4; the setting up of new tensions by the resolution of former ones 2β5. Rhythmic con tinuity is the basis of the organic unity which gives permanence to living bodies, a permanence which is a pattern of changes 26e. Finally we may note the principle of assimilation, which solves the problems of the relations of words to music. This principle has immediate application to the problems of liturgical music, but beyond that it suggests analogies for other problems concerning the relationships of elements entering into the whole of a sacramentai symbol. The good composer neither ignores the character of lan guage nor obeys poetic laws. Rather, he transforms the whole verbal material into musical elements. When words enter into music, they are no longer prose or poetry, but elements of music, helping to create and develope the primary illusion of music, virtual time. Words may enter into musical structure without being understood: the semblance of speech may be enough. In Gregorian chant, it is not the sentiment expressed in the words which makes them all-important, but the cohesion of the Latin line, the simplicity of statement, the greatness of certain words, which contribute to the musical whole 267. The danger of introducing words into music is that of losing the properly musical illusion under the impact of personal utterance. Something must be done to assure the impersonality and objectivity of the work of art. It is mainly the formalities of its performance which safeguard the musical illusion. Choric 2β2 FF, 109 (my italics); cf. 113: « ...The primary illusion of music is the sonorous image of passage, abstracted from actuality to become free and plastic and entirely perceptible » (my italics). 263 FF, 125. 264 FF, 126. 265 FF, 127. 266 FF, 127. 262 FF, 150-151.</page><page sequence="23">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 637 song is a strong antidote to sentimentalism: the chorus is an impersonal influence. Where a single cantor intones the music, artistic integrity is preserved by the spirit of his vicariate, his own « depersonalized » status: the chant is conceived as something objective and efficacious, and not as an opportunity for self-expression. The self and ali its desires are held in abeyance as the priest celebrates his office263. (2) Dance. The primary illusion of dance is a virtual realm of power2*9. The basic abstraction, by which its illusion is created and shaped, is virtual gesture 27°. It will be easier to consider first the basic abstraction. Gesture is vital, expressive movement271. To the one who performs it, the gesture is known as a kinetic experience, as an action, and more vaguely by sight as an effect. To others the gesture appears as a visible motion, but not a motion of things sliding or waving or rolling about: it is seen and understood as vital movement. Hence it is always at once subjective and objective, personal and public, willed (or evoked) and perceived 272. A gesture may be self-expressive: symptomatic of existing subjective conditions; or logically expressive: symbolic of a concepì, which may or may not refer to factually given condi tions. At times, a gesture may be both self-expressive and logically expressive. Gesture as self-expression, as symptom, as part of man's actual behavior, is not art, but simply vital movement. The squirrel's gesture is vital movement, not art. But when the movement which was an actual gesture in the squirrel is imagined, so that it may be performed apart from the squirrel's momentary situation and mentality, it becomes an artistic element, a possible dance gesture, a virtual gesture, a free symbolic form, which may be used to convey ideas of emotion, of awareness and premonition, or other physical and mental tensions. Virtual gestures are not signals or symptoms, but symbols, the semblance of gesture273. 2ββ FF, 152. 269 FF, 175 ; cf. 192 : « a realm of virtual Power. » 220 FF, 174-175; 180-181; 187; 196; 198. 221 FF, 174: « vital movement»; 180: « expressive movement. » 222 FF, 174. 228 FF, 174-175; 180-181.</page><page sequence="24">638 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. In dance there is a complex mingling of actual and virtual gesture. The dancer's movements are actual: they spring from an intention. Yet they are not the gestures they seem to be, since they seem to spring from feeling, but really do not. Here actual gestures are used to create a semblance of self-expression and thus are transformed into virtual spontaneous movement, or virtual gesture. The emotion in which the gesture begins is virtual, a dance element, which turns the whole movement into dance gesture. What controls the performance of the actual movement? It is an actual body feeling, like that which controls the production of tones in musical performance: the final articula tion of imagined feeling in its appropriate physical form. The conception of the feeling disposes the dancer's body to sym bolize it. Thus virtual gesture may create the semblance of self-expression without anchoring it in the actual personality of the dancer. The actual personality of the dancer, like the actual gestures, disappears in the dance. In its place there is the created personality, a dance element which figures simply as a psychical, human or superhuman being expressing itself 274: ... The salient point is that in dance the basic abstraction itself involves a Scheingefiihl. Real gesture springs from feeling (physical or psycho-physical); the semblance of gesture, therefore, if it is made by means of actual move ment, must be a movement that seems to spring from feeling. But the feeling that is implied in such an ap parently spontaneous « gesture » is itself a created ele ment — a Scheingefiihl — and may even be attributed not to the dancer, but to some naturai or supernatural power expressing itself through him...275 The primary illusion of dance is a virtual realm of power: not actual physical power, but the appearance of influence and agency created by virtual gesture. In ballet one does not see people running around. Rather, one sees the dance driving this way, drawn that way, gathering here, spreading there, fleeing, resting, rising. The motion seems to spring from powers beyond the performers. Two dancers seem to 274 FF, 180-181. 275 FF, 183.</page><page sequence="25">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 639 magnetize each other: the relation between them is more than spatial; it is a relation of forces. Yet the forces which seem to be physical are not physical at ali. They are dance forces, virtual powers 2TC. The prototype of these purely apparent energies is not the « field of forces » known to physics, but the sub jective experience of volition and free agency, and of reluctance to alien, compelling wills. The consciousness of life, the sense of vital power, even of the power to receive impressions, apprehend the environment, and meet changes, is our most immediate self-consciousness. This is the feeling of power; and the play of such « felt » energies is as different from any system of physical forces as psychological time is from clock-time, and psychological space from the space of geometry 277. The recognition of a trae artistic illusion, a realm of « Powers », wherein purely imaginary beings from whom the vital force emanates shape a whole world of dynamic forms by their magnet-like, psycho-physical actions, lifts the concept of Dance out of ali its theoretical entangle ments with music, painting, comedy and carnival or ser ious drama, and lets one ask what belongs to dancing, and what does not. It determines, furthermore, exactly how other arts are related to the ancient balletic art, and explains why it is so closely linked with amusement, dressing-up, frivolity, on the one hand and with religion, terror, mysticism and madness on the other. Above ali, it upholds the insight that dance, no matter how diverse its phases and how multifarious, perhaps even undignified its uses, is unmistakably and essentially art, and per forms the functions of art in worship as in play27S. Langer fìnds this theory implicit in ali conceptions of dance. There is always the recognition of created dance forces, impersonal agencies, especially of controlied, rhythmicized, for mally conceived gesture begetting the illusion of emotions and wills in conflict. Thus, the aim of the great dancer Mary Wigman, according to Arthur Michel, was to realize the human being as tension in space: the dissolution of the dancer into 2™ FF, 175-176. 2" FF, 176. 278 FF, 184.</page><page sequence="26">640 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. swaying movement discharging tension. When she was danc ing her torso and limbs seemed to be governed by a power of nature acting according to secret laws. A second dancer, or a group, makes the polarity of space tension visible. « ... The dancing group is a personality, an aching, suffering creature assailed by dance tension which drives it to struggle with a visible (or invisible) partner. The chorus, on the contrary, is a dancing mass. Its movements are not the expression of what it is feeling individually. It moves according to imper sonal laws... » 279 It is important here to follow Langer's further considera tions on virtual powers, for they suggest some interesting questions concerning the relationships of dance as an art form, mythic consciousness, and religious symbolism. Ali forces that cannot be scientifìcally established and measured must be regarded, from the philosophical stand point, as illusory; if, therefore, such forces appear to be part of our direct experience, they are « virtual », i.e. non actual semblances. This applies to chthonic powers, di vine powers, fates and spells and ali mystic agencies, the potency of prayer, of will, of love and hate, and also the oft-assumed hypnotic power of one's mind over another (hereby, I do not mean to cali in question the phenomenon of hypnotizing a subject, but only the con cepì of a psychical « force » emanating from the « master mind ») 28°. The assumption of mysterious « powers » or concentrations of forces not calculable in mathematica! terms dominates ali pre-scientific imagination. The world picture of naive men stems from the pattern of subjective action and passion, just as the envisionment of spatial relations begins with our « natu rai » geometry. Though the conception of « powers » in nature operating like impulses, and of forces inhering in things as strength is felt to be in the body, is obvious, stili it is a myth, built on the most primitive symbol, the body. This conception of the world as a realm of living forces, each having desires and purposes which bring it into conflict with other similar 279 FF, 185, quoting Arthur Michel. 280 FF, 188 (my italics, except for phenomenon).</page><page sequence="27">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 64] powers, is really the key idea of ali mythical interpretations: the idea of the spirit world. ...The formulation engendered by the subjective model is really a great metaphor, in which our « naturai » con ception of the world is expressed; but where the human mind has only one symbol to represent an idea, the sym bol and its meaning are not separable, because there is no other form in which the meaning could be thought and distinguished from the symbol. Consequently the great metaphor is identified with its meaning; the feelings of power that serve as symbols are attributed to the reality symbolized, and the world appears as a realm of potent Beings 2S1. This conception of nature, which Cassirer called « mythic consciousness », dominated primitive dance, as it dominated ali social development. The primitive dance form, the circle, sym bolized the realm of the sacred, the magic circle, in which ali demonic powers are loosed 282. ...What is created [in the various kinds of dance] is the image of a world of vital forces, embodied or disem bodied; in the early stages of human thought when sym bol and import are apprehended as one reality, this image is the realm of holiness; in later stages it is recognized as the work of art, the expressive form which it really is. But in either case, the several dance elements have es sentially constructive purposes. They have to establish, maintain, and articulate the play of « Powers » 283. The substance of such dance creation is the same Power that enchanted ancient caves and forests, but today we invoke it with full knowledge of its illusory status, and therefore with wholly artistic intent. The realm of magic around the aitar was broken, inevitably and properly, by the growth of the human mind from mythic concep tion to philosophical and scientific thought. The dance, that most sacred instrument of sorcery, worship, and prayer, bereft of its high office, suffered the degeneration of ali cast-off rituals into irrational custom or social play. 281 FF, 188-189. 282 FF, 189-192. 283 FF, 193.</page><page sequence="28">642 WILLIAM A. VAN 800, S. I. But it has left us the legacy of its great illusions, and with them the challenge to an artistic imagination no longer dependent on delusione for its motive powers. Once more human beings dance with high seriousness and fervor; the tempie dance and the rain dance were never more reverent than the work of our devout ar tiste 2S4. One more passage, hearing directly on the primary illusion of dance without further philosophical or scientific purging of « delusions », will suffice to complete this account: The primary illusion of dance is a peculiarly rich expe rience, just as immediate as that of music or of the plastic arts, but more complex. Both space and time are implicitly created with it. Story runs through it like a thread, without linking it at ali to literature; impersonation and miming are often systematically in volved in its basic abstraction, virtual gesture, but dance pantomime is not drama; the mummery of masks and costumes, to which its thematic gestures belong, is deper sonalizing rather than humanly interesting. Dance, the art of the Stone Age, the art of primitive life par excel lence, holds a hegemony over ali art materials 28S. (3) Poetry. Langer's discussion of poetry, especially of lyric poetry, can be situated in the larger context of her treat ment or mention of related forms. The following scheme, arranging elements of her treatment, may help to indicate the relative generality of her statements concerning poesis, litera ture, and poetry: (lyric /poetry ) /in general \ (narrative _Jballad /literature — j (romance \ / (fiction (esp. the novel) poesis —{ Prose — 1 ; , (non-fiction / (comedy \ drama ' (tragedy 284 FF, 206-207. 285 FF, 204.</page><page sequence="29">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 643 Poesis is poetic art in the broad sense, wider than litera ture, because there are other modes of poetic imagination than the presentation of life through language alone28β. Litera ture in the narrow sense is a verbal art, whose products are works of imagination to be heard or read 287. The primary illusion of ali poetic art is the illusion of life 288, a history entirely « experienced »28e, experiential history 290, virtual his tory291, virtual life 292. Besides the fact that drama uses other materials than language, it differs from literature in its mode. Literature creates the illusion of life in the mode of a virtual past29S. Drama and its variante create the illusion of life, but not in the mnemonic projection, not as a virtual past294, but rather in the mode of dramatic action, normally oriented toward the future 295. The literary mode is that of memory; the dramatic, that of destiny 298. The primary illusion of literature is described in much the same terms as that of poetic art generally: the semblance of life 297, virtual life29S, virtual experience 2", organized from the semblance of events lived and felt 30°. The basic abstrac tion is the creation of the appearance of experiences, of the semblance of events 3W, the creation of illusory events 302, vir tual events 303. The process of abstraction involves a simplifica tion of the events treated, as a result of which they may be much more fully perceived and evaluated than the jumble of happenings in any person's actual experience 304.

VAN ROO, S. I. takes its character as much from what is left out as from what is named30B. Especially in lyric poetry, every element has an emotional value: ... Everything in the poem has a doublé character: each item is at once a detail of a perfectly convincing virtual event, and an emotional factor. There is nothing in the whole structure that has not its emotional value, and nothing that does not contribute to the illusion of a definite and ... familiar human situation. That illusion would not be helped at ali by additional knowledge — by actual familiarity with the place referred to, further in forma tion about the career or personality [of the person involved], or footnotes on the authorship of the poem and on the circumstances of its composition. Such further additions would only clutter the poetic image of fife with irrelevant items — irrelevant because they do not spring from the organizing principle whereby the illusion is wrought: that every element in the action is also an expression of the feeling involved in the action, so that the poet creates events in a psychological mode rather than as a piece of objective history 30B. ...virtual events are qualitative in their very constitu tion — the « facts » have no existence apart from values; their emotional import is part of their appearance; they cannot, therefore, be stated and then « reacted to ». They occur only as they seem — they are poetic facts, not neutral facts toward which we are invited to take a poetic attitude 307. For several reasons, lyric poetry reveals most clearly the properties of ali literary art. First, in reading the lyric people can feel, if not explain, the difference between literal import and artistic import. Second, the purely verbal materials — met rical stresses, vowel values, rhyme, alliteration, etc. — are ex ploited more fully in poetry than in prose. Consequently the technique of writing is more apparent in verse, and more easily studied in that restricted field: lyric poetry makes the fullest use of language sound and rhythm, assonance and sen 305 FF, 216. 3o« FF, 216. sor FF, 223.</page><page sequence="31">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 645 suous associations. Third, ali other forms of literary art may be understood by the specialization and extension of poetic devices. Ali writing illustrates the same creative principles 30s. The reason why lyric poetry exploits fully the sound and emotional character of language is that it works with very scanty materials. Its motif is usually only a thought, a vision, a mood, or a poignant emotion: not a very strong framework for the creation of a bit of virtual history. The lyric poet has neither plot nor fictitous characters nor, usually, intellectual argument to give his poem continuity. The quality of his language must do almost everything. Here above ali the way of saying things is important30B. « ... A poem always creates the symbol of a feeling, not by recalling objects which would elicit the feeling itself, but by weaving a pattern of words — words charged with meaning, and colored by literary associa tions — akin to the dynamic pattern of the feeling.... » 309\ Besides the limitations of its subject matter and the con centrated exploitation of the resources of language, another characteristic distinguishes lyric poetry, its timelessness: ...the semblance most frequently created in a lyric is that of a very limited event, a concentrated bit of his tory — the thinking of an emotional thought, a feeling about someone or something. The framework is one of occurrent ideas, not external happenings; contemplation is the substance of the lyric, which motivates and even contains the emotion presented. And the naturai tense is the present. Ideas are timeless; in a lyric they are not said to have occurred, but are virtually occurring; the relations that hold them together are timeless, too. The whole creation in a lyric is an awareness of a sub jective experience, and the tense of subjectivity is the « timeless » present. This kind of poetry has the « closed » character of the mnemonic mode, without the historical fìxity that outward events bestow on real memories; it is in the « historical projection » without chronology. Lyric writing is a specialized technique that constructs an impression or an idea as something experienced, in a sort of eternai present; in this way, instead of offering abstract propositions into which time and causation sim 308 FF, 213, 258, 304. so» FF, 259, 208, 211-212. «μ* FF, 230.</page><page sequence="32">646 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. ply do not enter, the lyric poet creates a sense of con crete reality from which the time element has been can celled out, leaving a Platonic sense of « eternity » 31°. Finally, Langer notes what sets poetry apart from dream and neurosis. Poetry differs from these in its purpose: to convey something which the poet knows and wishes to set forth by the only symbolic form that will express it: ...A poem is not, like dream, a proxy for literal ideas, intended to hide wishes and feelings from oneself and others; it is meant to be always emotionally transparent. Like ali deliberate expression, it meets a public standard of excellence. One does not say of a sleeper that he dreams clumsily, nor of a neurotic that his symptoms are carelessly strung together; but a poet may certainly be charged with ineptitude or carelessness. The process of poetic organization is not a spontaneous association of images, words, situations, and emotions, ali amazingly interwoven, without effort, through the unconscious ac tivity Freud called « the dream work ». Literary composi tion, however « inspired », requires invention, judgment, often trial and rejection, and long contemplation. An air of unstudied spontaneous utterance is apt to be as painstakingly achieved as any other quality in the poetic fiction3". (4) Drama. Like ali poetic art, drama creates the illusion of virtual history. It is a distinct poetic art, for it has its own basic abstraction, and consequently its own way of mak ing the semblance of history. Its basic abstraction is the act, springing from the past, but directed toward the future. Thus the virtual history of drama is a virtual future. Though the theater creates a perpetuai present moment, « ... it is only a present filled with its own future that is really dramatic... » The dramatic mode is that of destiny312. Whereas story telling projects a history in retrospect, drama is history com ing313. As a poetic art in a special mode, drama « ... is neither ritual nor show business, though it may occur in the frame sìo FF, 268. su FF. 244-245. 312 FF, 306-307. 313 FF, 321.</page><page sequence="33">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 647 of either one; it is poetry, which is neither a kind of circus nor a kind of church »314. By reason both of its materials and of its basic abstrac tion, the dramatic art form makes great demands on the play wright who « creates » it: Drama is more variable, more tolerant of choices made by performing artists, than any other art and mode. For this reason, the « commanding form », which is established by the playwright, must be clear and powerful. It has to govern the crisscross of many imaginative minds, and hold them ali — the director, the actors, the designers of sets and lights and costumes — to one essential con ception, an unmistakable « poetic core ». But the poet must give his interpreters scope, too; for drama is es sentially an enacted poem, and if the acting can only duplicate what the lines already effect, there will be unintended redundancy, and an apparent clutter of super fluous elements that makes the total form impure and opaque...315 Unlike a literary work, a drama is not made of words. Yet the poet composes only the « lines ». How, then, can he be said to create the commanding form? The « lines » are the stuff of speeches in the play, and the answer to the question lies in two aspects of speech. First, although speeches are only some of the acts that make up the drama, they are acts of a special sort. Speech is « ... the overt issue of a greater emotional, mental and bodily response, and its preparation in feeling and awareness or in the mounting intensity of thought is implicit in the words spoken. Speech is like a quintessence of action... »313 Second, in a work of art, speech is of the same nature as the elements which surround it, subject to the same basic abstraction. « ... In drama speech is an act, an utterance, mo tivated by visible and invisible other acts, and like them shaping the oncoming Future » 3". The playwright, composing the lines which are uttered in a play, marks a long series of culminating 3" FF, 320. μ® FF, 314. aie FF, 314. 317 FF, 315.</page><page sequence="34">648 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. moments in the action. Though he indicates also the major non-verbal acts, such stage directions do not partake of the dramatic form, and directors and actors take liberties with them. « ... The lines of the play are the only guide a good director or actor needs. What makes the play the author's work is that the lines are really the highlights of a perpetuai, progressive action, and determine what can be done with the piece on stage »31S. « Since every utterance is the end of a process which began inside the speaker's body, an enacted utterance is part of a virtual act, apparently springing at the moment from thought and feeling; so the actor has to create the illusion of an inward activity issuing in spontaneous speech, if his words are to make a dramatic and not a rhetorical effect... »319 Within the realm of dramatic art, there is a deep struc tural difference between comedy and tragedy. The underlying feeling of comedy is the pure sense of life. In man, this sense of life is infinitely complex and variable. Basically it is the feeling of what distinguishes organic nature from inorganic: self-preservation, self-restoration, functional tendency, purpose. It is this basic biological pattern, this round of conditioned and conditioning organic processes, that produces the life rhythm. Beyond actions of defense and accommodation, the impulse to survive appears also in the power of organisms to seize on opportunities. Closely intertwined with the life impulse in higher animals, the sex impulse and sexual excite ment have a rhythm that engages the whole animai in a much higher degree than any other emotive response. In man, there is the basic rhythm of animai existence, rendered incomparably more complex. Man's powers of language and imagination have set his world apart from that of other creatures. A man is related not only to others who visibly or tangibly surround him, but also to people who are absent, including the dead. Symbolic construction has given him an awareness of events far greater than the scope of his physical perceptions, and has created this vastly involved and extended world 32°. Human life feeling is the essence of comedy. The comic poet creates the illusion of the oncoming future full of dangers 3i8 FF, 315. a" FF, 315-316. 320 FF, 327-331.</page><page sequence="35">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 649 and opportunities. This ineluctable future, beyond human knowledge and control, is Fortune. « ... Destiny in the guise of Fortune is the fabric of comedy; it is developed by comic action, which is the upset and recovery of the protagonist's equilibrium, his contest with the world and his triumph by wit, luck, personal power, or even humorous, or ironical, or philosophical acceptance of mischance ... »321 Comedy has the rhythm of sheer vitality 322, of organic unity, growth, and self preservation 323. The mood of comedy varies. It may be serious. Heroic drama, romantic drama, politicai drama are serious, yet ali are in the comic pattern 324. Though heroic drama has dignity or sublimity, it does not have the rhythm of tragedy: that of the growth and full realization of a personality 325. Though there are rare serious comedies, the naturai vein of comedy is humorous. Comic drama is the home of humor, and laughter springs from its very structure32e. What is the relation between humor and the sense of life? And what is the relation of each to laughter? Humor is only one of the causes of laughter: where laughter is provoked by ideas, cognitions, fancies. Laughter also accompanies emo tions, such as disdain, and at times the feeling of pleasure. One laughs when he is tickled, or in hysterics. Laughter, ac cording to some theorists, always betokens a sudden sense of superiority. Though there are ludicrous persone or situations, they must be discovered by the laugher: laughter requires a conceptual element: so runs.one theory of laughter 327. Yet, according to Langer, this theory is stili too narrow. « ... The ultimate source of laughter is physiological, and the various situations in which it arises are simply its normal or abnormal stimuli.... Laughter, or the tendency to laugh ... seems to arise from a surge of vital feeling... Laughter is not a simple overt act, as the single word suggests; it is the spectacular end of a complex process. As speech is the culmination of a mental 321 FF, 331. 322 FF, 332. 323 FF, 350. 324 FF, 334. 325 FF, 336-338. 326 FF, 338. sai FF, 339-340.</page><page sequence="36">650 WILLIAM A. VAN KOO, S. I. activity, laughter is a culmination of feeling — the crest of a wave of felt vitality » 328. Though a sudden sense of superiority is one source of heightening of vi tal feeling, it is not the only one: we need not be making fun of anyone: Laughter is, indeed, a more elementary thing than humor. We often laugh without finding any person, object, or situation funny. People laugh for joy in active sport, in dancing, in greeting friends; in returning a smile, one acknowledges another person's worth instead of flaunting one's own superiority and finding him funny 329. Ali this pertains to laughter in actual life. What is its role in drama? The only legitimate source of the spectator's laugh in comedy is his appreciation of humor in the piece. He does not laugh with the characters, nor at them, but at their acts. In a good play the « laughs » are poetic elements: its humor and its pathos belong to virtual life, and the spectator delights in something created for his perception, not in a direct stimulus to his own feelings 33°. Though comic figures are often buffoons, they are almost always sympathetic; though they are knocked about and abused, they are indestructible, and eternally self confident and good-humored. Ancient folk theater shows what the buffoon really is: ... the indomitable living creature fending for itself, tum bling and stumbling (as the clown physically illustratesi from one situation into another, getting into scrape after scrape and getting out again, with or without a thrashing. He is the personified élan vital\ his chance adventures and misadventures, without much plot, though often with bizarre complications, his absurd expectations and disap pointments, in fact his whole improvised existence has the rhythm of primitive, savage, if not animalian life, coping with a world that is forever taking new uncal culated turns, frustrating, but exciting. He is neither a good man nor a bad one, but is genuinely amoral, — now triumphant, now worsted and rueful, but in his ruefulness and dismay he is funny, because his energy is 328 FF, 340. 329 FF, 341. 33» FF, 341-342.</page><page sequence="37">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 651 really unimpaired and each failure prepares the situation for a new fantastic move ...331. Comedy abstracts and reincarnates for our perception the motion and rhythm of living. Hence it enhances our vital feeling. Virtual life is not diffuse and half felt, as actual life usually is. Virtual life, moving visibly into the future, is intensified, speeded up, exaggerated. In the theater we laugh at trifles which are funnier where they occur than they would be in actual life. « ... They occur where the tension of dialogue or other action reaches a high point. As thought breaks into speech — as the wave breaks into foam — vitality breaks into humor » 332. « ... Real comedy sets up in the audience a sense of general exhilaration, because it presents the very image of ' livingness ' and the perception of it is exciting... »33S. Finally, comedy is characterized by a lightness which sets it off from tragedy. It has a « light rhythm of thought » which is the rhythm of life: ... the reason it is « light » is that ali creatures love life, and the symbolization of its impetus and flow makes us really aware of it. The conflict with the world whereby a living being maintains its own complex organic unity is a delightful encounter; the world is as promising and alluring as it is dangerous and opposed. The feeling of comedy is a feeling of heightened vitality, challenged wit and will, engaged in the great game with Chance. The real antagonist is the World. Since the personal antagonist is really that great Challenger, he is rarely a complete villain; he is interesting, entertaining, his defeat is a hilarious success but not his destruction. There is no permanent defeat and permanent human triumph except in tragedy; for nature must go on if life goes on, and the world that presents ali obstacles also supplies the zest of life... 334. Tragedy has a different basic feeling, and consequently a different form and different thematic material. Character de velopment, great moral conflicts, and sacrifice are its usuai 331 ff, 342. 332 ff, 345. 333 ff, 348. 334 FF, 348-349.</page><page sequence="38">652 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. actions. It is this that makes tragedy sad, as the rhythm of sheer vitality makes comedy happy 335. Tragedy's rhythm is that of the growth and full realization of a personality33&lt;!. The tragic feeling arises from the contemplation of other aspects of life. In the higher forms of life, there is a definite beginning, ascent, turning point, descent, and dose; and the dose is death. Man is aware of his individuai history as a passage from birth to death, a single undertaking, and he can conceive of himself as a unified and developed being, a per sonality. He looks for as much life as possible between birth and death, and regards his career as one of self-realization, of fulfìlling his individuai destiny 337. Whereas comedy presents the vital rhythm of self-preservation, tragedy shows that of self consummation. Its form is cadential. Its crisis is the turn toward an absolute dose33s. Destiny viewed as a future shaped in advance and only incidentally affected by chance happenings is Fate: this is the virtual future of tragedy. As comedy is the image of Fortune, tragedy is that of Fate 339. Approaching the question of the « tragic rhythm », Langer recalls her defìnition of rhythm. Its essence is the preparation of a new event by the ending of a previous one; the setting up of new tensions by the resolution of former ones 34°. In drama, the dramatic act is a commitment, creating a situation in which the agent or agents must necessarily make a further move. The situation, created by a given act, is already the impetus to another. Dramatic acts are connected with each other so that every one indirectly or directly motivates what follows it. The rhythm is the « commanding form » of the play, and the total action is a cumulative form, an organic form, constructed by the rhythmic treatment of its elements 341. In tragedy the tragic rhythm, the pattern of a life that grows, flourishes, and declines, is abstracted by being transfer red from naturai activity to the sphere of characteristically human action: 335 FF, 331-332. 336 FF, 336. 337 FF, 332-333. 338 FF, 351. 339 FF, 333. 340 FF, 126. 3« FF, 355-356.</page><page sequence="39">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 653 Tragic drama is so designed that the protagonist grows mentally, emotionally, or morally, by the demand of the action, which he himself initiated, to the complete ex haustion of his powers, the limit of his possible develop ment. He spends himself in the course of the one dramatic action. This is, of course, a tremendous foreshortening of life; instead of undergoing the physical and psychical, many-sided, long process of an actual biography, the tragic hero lives and matures in some particular respect; his entire being is concentrated in one aim, one passion, one conflict and ultimate defeat. For this reason the prime agent of tragedy is heroic; his character, the unfolding situation, the scene, even though ostensibly familiar and humble, are ali exaggerated, charged with more feeling than comparable actualities would possess. This intensifì cation is necessary to achieve and sustain the « form in suspense » that is even more important in tragic drama than in comic, because the comic denouement, not marking an absolute dose, needs only to restore a balance, but the tragic ending must recapitiate the whole action to be a visible fulfìllment of a destiny that was implicit in the beginning... 342. III. REFLECTIONS Treating Cassirer and Langer in succession has advantages which go beyond the appropriation of their complementary contributions to a theory of symbolism. A closer examination and reflection bring out differences which both reveal their merits and their limitations, and raise further questions which cali for a more ampie and more profound account of the whole intelligible field in which symbolism may be situated and better understood. I do not suggest lumping their works. Nor do I see any profit in a merely general reflection embracing both. Rather, I shall propose some reflections regarding each in turn, indicating some lines of further investigation needed for a general theory of symbol, and in particular for a theological treatment of the Christian sacrament as a kind of symbol. FF, 357.</page><page sequence="40">654 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. A. - Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1) Merits. Cassirer's great work on symbolic forms is challenging and rewarding. The challenge of a long, at times trying, argument is obvious. Cassirer moves through a vasi array of evidence from studies of myth, religion, and language, and from the history of mathematics and physics. Moreover, he works consistently with a rigorously philosophical method inspired by Kant, a method which makes great demands on the reader. Cassirer is a neo-kantian from start to finish; yet it is not enough to categorize him thus, without recognizing his personal achievement. Part of the reward of a serious study of Cassirer consists in the sharing of many insights. Part consists in the stimulus given by further insights into the severe limitations of his work, and by questions which point in several directions beyond his account of symbolic forms. Working seriously and intelligently in a Kantian tradition, Cassirer has gone far beyond Kant in at least three aspects of his thought. First, he has extended the theory of the formative function of the human spirit or consciousness. The decisive boundary for Cassirer is not between perception and language, or between perception and scientific cognition, but between passive sense impression and perception. Whereas Kant was concerned only with the formative role of reason in scientific knowledge, Cassirer recognized a far wider range of formative activity and of concept formation. Second, as a consequence, Cassirer appreciated the proper values and achievements of concept formation and symbolizing activity in myth, religion, and art, as well as in science. Third, with a vast, profound knowledge of modem mathematics and physics, Cassirer went beyond Kant in his account of properly scientific concept forma tion and general methodology. Cassirer proposed a program for, and contributed to the realization of, a complete phe nomenology of human consciousness, a prolegomenon to a full philosophy of human culture. Though Cassirer's theory of the concept is inadequate, stili he has contributed to an understanding of the charac teristics of ali conception: the grasp of a relationship which is already somehow involved in the data of perception. The whole series of operations from perception through various</page><page sequence="41">SYMBOL ACCORDINO ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 655 modes of concepì formation to the scientific concept of pure relation or pure signification is marked by isomorphism, a likeness of logicai relation, an analogy of structures. Every distinctive mode of concept formation is a new manner of grasping and formulating the same basic kinds of relations: space, time, number, thing-attribute, and cause-effect. Con sistently with his purely phenomenological method, Cassirer is interested only in the contents of consciousness, in conscious ness as a unity of functions, and in the unity of analogous structures running through ali modes of concept formation. Beyond his own purpose, however, the results of his work can serve as a catalyst for the further elaboration of psychology, epistemology, and of a fully metaphysical account of human knowledge, as I shall suggest farther on. From its beginnings in sensation, ali human knowledge involves a grasp and expres sion of relationships which somehow are exhibited in the concrete data of perception, and there is a properly intellectual dimension of ali modes of human knowledge, every one of which has its value and its unique role in man's total cultural achievement. With his basic insight into the indispensable formative activity of the human spirit, Cassirer offers a recurrent and effective rebuttai of various forms of mere empiricism, sensa tionism, associationism, and behaviorism. In particular, several features of Cassirer's work deserve serious attention. His treatment of mythic consciousness as one of the great modes of human thought is stimulating, and affords an interesting complement to the descriptive-phenomen ological accounts which are common in works of comparative religion. His study of the stages of language formation is valuable, not only for its insight into the general mode of intuitive-representative thought, but also for its account of the characteristics of ordinary discursive language, as a particular kind of symbol. Remote as some of Cassirer's concerns and conclusions may be from more recent studies of language and linguistic philosophy, his work consolidates results of earlier studies and offers some insights which should not be neglected. Finally, Cassirer's account of the development of mathematical and scientific concept formation and general method deserves</page><page sequence="42">656 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. serious consideration and comparison with more recent work, especially Lonergan's Insight34S. (2) Limitations and further questions. (a) The range of symbolic forms. In observing that Cassirer did not treat the full range of symbolic forms, one is not making an adverse criticism. Cassirer himself modestly proposed his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms as a mere beginning. Having noted his achievements, we may profitably note too what remains to be done by others. With regard to myth, Cassirer was concerned almost exclusively with the mode of mythic thought or con sciousness, and did little to determine whether or not the particular symbols used in that stage of culture have a proper structure and character. Since he distinguishes myth and lan guage as modes of thought, one would be interested in a consideration of the relation of mythical language to ordinary language in the same primitive men. A similar question occurs regarding mythic man's non-linguistic, presentational symbols, m relation to the symbolic forms of art. With regard to language and sCientific symbols, Cassirer leaves the boundary rather obscure. The written (or imagined) mathematical symbol seems clearly enough to be different from ordinary language, but its relations to language return when men « read » mathematics aloud in a variety of languages. Furthermore, scientific, technical, and philosophical languages are not merely a matter of mathematical symbols, and there remain further questions concerning « language » as a distinct symbolic form. Moving from his treatment of myth, Cassirer makes some effort to distinguish it from the further developments in religious symbolism. I do not pretend to be able to judge the accuracy of his information or the depth of his understanding of the many other religions which he uses as illustrations, but nowhere in his treatment of Israelite or of Christian religion does he manifest either sufficient knowledge or understanding. Ques tions concerning a properly Christian world view and a unique quality of Christian sacramentai symbolism remain open. Three other realms of symbolism remain to be explored: art, dreams, and a kind of « metaphysics » — by this or any 3*3 Bernard J. F. Lonergan, S J., Insight. A Study of Human Under standing (London, New York, Toronto: Longmans, Green and Co., 1957).</page><page sequence="43">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 657 other name! — which nowhere appears to have been known to Cassirer. In the whole range of symbolic forms, of modes of human symbolizing activity, such a metaphysics has a distinct place, and a role which is unfìlled in Cassirer's world of thought. (b) Classification of symbolic forms. It is easy enough to take one of Cassirer's lists of symbolic forms, for example: myth, religion, language, and scientifìc thought, and then go on to add other kinds of symbols. One could emulate Charles Peirce, who is reported to have listed 59,049 kinds of « symbol situations », which he then reduced to 66 344. A list of kinds of symbols is one thing. A scientifìc classification of symbols would be another. I have noted the polyvalence of the term « symbol » or « symbolic form » as applied to myth, language, and science: they may refer to a mode of thought, or a world view, or a set of particular kinds of symbols. When one notes further that the boundaries between them are obscure, and that relationships with other symbolic forms such as religion and art are not clear, he is safe in affirming simply that the question of a satisfactory classification of symbols remains open. (c) Pure phenomenology of consciousness. Without at tempting another critique of the Kantian critique, one must observe the limitations which Cassirer imposed upon himself in his choice of method, and the many questions concerning symbols which will remain unanswered as long as one confìnes himself to the realm defined by Cassirer's method. Cassirer distinguishes between the ontic and the phenom enal, usually on occasions when he insists that his whole concern is with the phenomenal. The ontic is the transcendent world of objects, the world of absolute objects. The phenom enal is the world built up by knowledge, which constitutes the phenomenal object 345. An example of the difference is life: life in itself, within the biological sphere, before it passes into symbolic forms, is purposively formed in itself, oriented toward determinate goals; the knowledge of these goals implies a breach with the immediacy and immanence of life; the acquisition of the world as idea is the aim and produci of symbolic forms: 344 Cf. Langer, PhNK, 55-56. 3*5 PhSF III, 44: see above, pp. 498499.</page><page sequence="44">658 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. of language, myth, religion, art, and theoretical knowledge34C. Cassirer's scope is a universal phenomenology of the spirit 847. At the outset I should observe a vagueness and looseness of Cassirer's terminology, in which consciousness, mind, spirit, intellect, thought appear as roughly equivalent, and to them, as to their particular modes, such as myth and cognition, various functions are attributed. Cassirer's rather fuzzy notion of « consciousness » is itself a strange latter-day creation of the ever-prolific, undifferentiated mythic « consciousness ». Acknowledging that consciousness is treated differently in metaphysics, epistemology, empirica! psychology, and pure phe nomenology, Cassirer is concerned only with the method of pure phenomenology. He considers the content of conscious ness. Subjectivity for him is a totality of functions. He studies the originai attitudes and formative modes of consciousness, the structure of perceptive, intuitive, and cognitive conscious ness 34S. The « object » is entirely phenomenal, created by con sciousness according to one of its modes. Consciousness creates definite sensory contents as an expression for definite complexes of meaning 349: the human spirit discloses itself by shaping sensible matter3G0, builds the world of perception by articulating sensory phenomena351. The process is that of consciousness, working from the quasi infinity of sensory particulars to con stitute an ordered whole. It is in the context of such a purely phenomenological method that one may understand Cassirer's notion of reality, and his attitude toward questions concerning the thing in itself. He remains in a world of images: not images which reproduce a self-subsistent world of « things », but images which are an autonomous creation of the spirit. Through them alone, for Cassirer, we see what we cali « reality », and in them alone we possess it. The highest objective truth accessible to the spirit is ultimately the form of its own activity. In this the human spirit perceives itself and reality. « ... True, the ques tion of what, apart from these spiritual functions, constitutes PhSF III, 275-276. see above, p. 497, note 31, and pp. 509-510. 347 PhSF III, 144: see above, pp. 498-499. 348 See above, pp. 490-491. 349 PhSF I, 105-106: see above, p. 495. ss» PhSF I, 88. 351 PhSF III, 221-222: see above, p. 502-503.</page><page sequence="45">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 659 absolute reality, the question of what the « thing in itself » may be in this sense, remains unanswered, except that more and more we learn to recognize it as a fallacy in formulation, an intellectual phantasm ... » 352 Cassirer himself underlines « this », and suggests the interpretation of his statement. It is in this sense, that is: in the whole context of the method of pure phenomenology, that questions concerning the thing in itself make no sense. His disregard for such questions, there fore, and his implicit rejection of them as meaningless, are relative, not absolute: they are part of the severe limitations of the method he has chosen. Whether such questions may be well formulated according to another method is another question. Though at times Cassirer would seem to waver or to fail to hold severely to the phenomenal realm, his clear, fìrm texts, especially in the more mature formulations of the third volume, leave no doubt concerning his exclusively phenomenological consideration. Instances of apparent wavering are these: (1) the symbol is no mere copy of the thing it represents 353; reproduc tion (even in imitative signs) does not consist in retracing line for line a specific content of reality, but in selecting a pregnant motif in that content, and so producing a characteristic outline of its form 354; in the mimetic stage language reproduces the sensory impression, clinging to the concrete phenomenon and its sensory image 355. Doubts are removed, however, by the clear texts. As for things, they too are phenomenal: it is only by reason of representation of an object in and through per ception that one may first speak of the unity of a « thing » 356; empirical « things » dealt with in our perceptive and intuitive world are « things » within a world concepì 357. In his whole account of knowledge, Cassirer starts not with things in them selves, but with sensory impressions. The dividing line between mere empiricism and physical theory is this: empiricism is content with apprehending isolated facts as provided by sen sory observation, and linking them in a purely descriptive 35:2 phSF I, 111 : see above, ρ. 499. 353 Cf. PhSF I, 107: see above, p. 507. 354 Cf. PhSF I, 182-184: see above, pp. 518-519. 355 Cf. PhSF I, 190: see above, p. 520. sse Cf. PhSF III, 322: see above, p. 504. »57 Cf.

I. manner; in physics there is law, as compared to immediate perception: concrete data provided by experience are replaced with symbolic representations35S. In explaining the passage from mathematics to physics as from ideal to real, from an originai unity to an existing multiplicity, an outward existence that is given to us through the intermediary of sensation and sensory intuition, Cassirer explains what he means: «...What we cali ' nature what we cali the ' existence of things con fronts us at first as a mere rhapsody of perceptions... » 359 In that rhapsody the individuai perception aspires to be some thing more than a mere position in a series. Cassirer is not con cerned with the individuai thing in itself, but with the indi viduai perception. Physical concept formation does not begin with wholly amorphous material: within the realm of the phenomenal we never encounter such a wholly structureless manifold. The most elementary sensuous stratum offers us a multiplicity determined by some serial principle, and the physical concept starts from this series in the sensuous phe nomena themselves. This would not be possible if perception did not already contain certain structural elements within itself 36°. Finally, when Cassirer speaks of a likeness of logicai rela tion between symbol and symbolized, or of formai analogy, isomorphism, or relation of structures, he is not speaking of a relation of thought to being, of concept to the thing in itself. The « outside limit » of his consideration is not the thing in itself, but the « ... reality that lies ready-made before us in particular sensations and intuitions ... » 361 In his general treat ment of the ideational content of the sign, in rejecting the copy theory Cassirer is rejecting the notion of the sign as a mere copy not of the thing in itself, but of the particular intuition 362. For him the process starts with the concrete sensuous content. The particular of consciousness « exists » only in so far as it potentially contains the whole and is, as it were, in Constant transition towards the whole. Conscious ness selects pregnant factors, and suppresses or passes over 358 Cf. PhSF III, 21. ss» PhSF III, 407. Cf. PhSF III, 424. sei PhSF I, 107. 362 PhSF I, 107.</page><page sequence="47">SYMBOL ACCORDINO ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 661 others, to make the general factor of form and relation sharper and clearer. The chemical formula is a clear example of the functioning of scientific signs. Expressing nothing of what direct observation and sensory perception reveal, the formula places the particular body in a rich and fìnely articulated complex of relations, a sum of potential reactions, defined by rules. In the formula the totality of these necessary relations fuses with the expression of the particular, giving this expres sion of the particular a new and characteristic imprint3es. In general, the particular sensory content is represented in the stream in which it occurs in consciousness, and thus ac quires the power to represent a universal 364. There is a like ness of relations: of the relations immanent in the stream of particulars of consciousness, and the relations grasped and expressed in the concept. Again, in the transition from mimetic to analogical language, there is a passage from the reproduc tion of one sensuous object or sense impression by one imita tive sound, to a formai analogy between a phonetic sequence and a sequence of sensuous contente 365. In mathematics, in tuitive data serve only as illustrations of the universal system of relations built up in pure thought. There may be a diversity of such sets of intuitive data, but their diversity is not signifi cant mathematically: from the mathematical point of view, ali the diverse intuitive spheres designate one object and one form: they are « isomorphous »: the same relations apply equal ly in ali of them3t&gt;e. In physics, the relation between the world of pure forms and the world of things never consists in correspondences between single forms and single things, but rather that only the two structures can be related to each other and measured by each other as totalities3&lt;i7. In short: likeness of logicai relations, formai analogy, isomorphism, and the relation of structures prevail entirely within the phe nomenal world. In the search for an understanding of the symbol, what further questions arise which cali for answers given from 363 phSF I, 108-109. 364 PhSF I, 110. ses PhSF I, 193. 366 PhSF III, 364. se? PhSF III, 420-421. « Things » must be understood too in the phe nomenological sense.</page><page sequence="48">662 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. beyond the limits of phenomenology? Admittedly the ques tions have no sense within a phenomenological method, but as Cassirer recognized, there are other considerations of con sciousness, and the further questions seeking a more complete reduction of symbolism to its intelligible principles are reason able for the man who is not willing to confine himself to the method and the results of phenomenology. First and most obvious: does the « thing in itself » play an important role in the formation and function of the symbol? It does. Sensory impressions are not an absolute beginning, nor an ultimate explanation of the « materials » with which « consciousness » works. In perception one grasps, fixes, forms the flux of impressions, and in the continuing process of con cepì formation the knower grasps and expresses more clearly the relations immanent in the flux of sensory impressions. But the whole process supposes that which is to be grasped. Grasping a Gestalt presupposes the unity and form of the thing in itself, acting on the senses with an action which has a certain whole dynamic pattern. Rendering the symbol intel ligible calls for two complementary accounts: one moving from the quasi infinity of sensory particulars through the formative process of consciousness to the constitution of an ordered totality; and another moving « outward » from the same mani fold to the principle in the « ontic » world which is indispen sable for their being and their intelligibility: the thing acting on the senses and being observed. Cassirer has worked at only the first of these two accounts. For him, perception first constitutes the unity of the « thing ». That may be true in the phenomenal world, but there is a prior existence and unity of the thing in the « ontic » world, and it is an indispensable factor in the whole process. One does not grasp the Gestalt of an elephant from the flux of impressions received in the observation of goldfish. As Cassirer acknowledged along the way, life in itself is purposive. If it were not, man would never come to the knowledge of purpose as characteristic of living beings. The thing in itself plays an essential role in the formation of the symbol. It plays an equally important role in the eventual verification of the intelligible world created by the scientist. Verification involves a series of judgments, grounded on the presence of things falling within experience.</page><page sequence="49">SYMBOL ACCOBDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 663 Verification does not occur simply in the phenomenal world: it may involve putting « ontic » men on an « ontic » moon. Second, there is a set of questions concerning the subject itself. For Cassirer in his purely phenomenological method, subjectivity is a totality of functions; « consciousness » is the content of consciousness: a range of sets of relations, analogous from perception through scientific concepì formation; and the highest objective truth that is accessible to the « spirit » is ultimately the form of its own activity. But who or what is knowing itself? Who or what is the agent, the operator, in the whole range of symbolizing activity? For Cassirer, con cern with the thing or with the subject is left behind when one moves from mythic and intuitive knowledge to scientific. It is hard to say what the subject is at the level of the philo sophical discourse reached in his universal phenomenology of consciousness or spirit. There is nothing but relations and « functions », but relations and functions do not operate. Since it is difficult to conduct a long discourse without reference to subjects and agents, Cassirer attributes actions to an ersatz subject and agent, variously called « consciousness », « spirit », « mind », « myth », « language », and so forth. There is a further question, admittedly beyond the range of Cassirer's method: what sort of real subject is capable of these opera tions? The answer to this question is indispensable to one who wishes to give an intelligible account of symbol and sym bolizing activity. It cannot be found in Cassirer. Enter Cas sirer's house if you will, but remember that you have been invited to leave your « things » and your « self » — body and soul — at the door. Both questions, or sets of questions, just indicated regard the interrelationship of the ontic and the phenomenal. A third question, regarding the same general interrelationship, con cerne the function of the symbol in the communication of knowledge. Cassirer was aware of this question, for he wrote: « ... [The sign] serves not merely to communicate a complete and given thought-content, but is an instrument, by means of which this content developes and fully defines itself... »368 Seemingly considering the role of the sign in communicating knowledge to be evident, Cassirer devoted his whole effort to 3β8 phSF I, 86: see above, p. 499.</page><page sequence="50">664 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. elaborating its role in the development of the thought-content. Both questions deserve attention. The sensuous substratum which is formed by consciousness is also an « ontic » substra tum. The sign is formed to function in the phenomenal world, but as an instrument in the communication of knowledge, it functions too in the ontic world, by a physical action upon, and sensible impression of, other knowers. This question, then, concerning the ontic function of the sign, and the inter relationship of ontic and phenomenal, remains open. (d) The purely relational, functional scientific concepì. In timately connected with Cassirer's purely phenomenological method is his insistence on the ideal toward which ali concept formation moves: the purely relational, functional scientific concept. The « thing » and the « subject » — always in a phenomenological sense — figure in the concepts of myth, religion, art, and common intuitive knowledge. They vanish in the conceptualization of modem science, in which a new modality of the relation constant-variable is developed. « ... The world is no longer taken as a world of Constant ' things ' whose attributes change in time; it has become a self-contained sys tem of ' events ', each of which is determined by four equivalent coordinates... As real in the physical sense we may now regard only the synthesis, the reciprocai relations between space, time, and matter, whereas each taken for itself has ceased to be anything more than a mere abstraction ... » 369 In the Einstein formulation of the law of conservation there is a « substance » of an entirely new order: the supreme triumph of the pure idea of substance over the mere representation of substance. What is defined as the ultimate physical reality has cast off ali appearance of thingness: there is no longer any meaning in speaking of one and the same matter at different times. «... Here the substantial is completely transposed into the functional: true and definitive p'ermanence is no longer im puted to an existence propagated in space and time but rather to those magnitudes and relations between magnitudes which provide the universal constants for the description of ali phys ical process. It is the invariance of such relations and not the existence of any particular entities which forms the ul timate stratum of objectivity » 37°. 369 PhSF III, 472: see above, pp. 529-530. "ο PhSF III, 473.</page><page sequence="51">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 665 A significant qualification in this last text of Cassirer is suggested by the words: « for the description of ali physical process ». For mathematics and physics the individuai thing or subject is insignificant, and does not figure in the systematic account of physical process. One may admit and admire the achievements of mathematical and physical concept formation, and yet hold that there are aspects of reality beyond mere physical process, and that the thing and the subject figure not only in myth, religion, art, and common-sense intuitive know ledge, but also in a rigorous philosophical discourse regarding the mystery of living things especially, and above ali the human person. Cassirer was effective in his refutations of sensationism, associationism, and pure empiricism. The « thing » is not just a bundle of sensations. The « self » is not a bundle of per ceptions. But since Cassirer was interested only in the phe nomenal thing and self, in the relationships which are im manent in the flux of sensory impressions and which are grasped and expressed in perception and in intuitive knowledge, he could move with the development of a kind of concept for mation which abandoned ali intuitive elements and succeeded in expressing pure relation, no longer incarnate in intuitive ele ments. Furthermore, he selected for his illustration of concept development the relation of number, and in his admiration of the absolute universality of the pure concept of number he seems to have forgotten that there are other relationships to be traced through the whole process of concept formation. The combination of pure phenomenology and of modem scien tific method brings « science » to a state in which thing and self simply vanish. Cassirer's account would leave scientific man dependent on myth, religion, and art to recapture his sense of the concrete whole. A man living on Cassirer's scientific diet could be sorely in need of the remedies of Jungian psy chology for the recovery of his sense of wholeness. But then, at the end of Cassirer's development, there is no scientific « man »: there is no « subject » to be ili or in need of therapy: there is only « science », « cognition », « theoretical thought » ... I suggest that some questions remain open, leading beyond the range of Cassirer's method. One regards the possibility of correcting the « copy theory » of knowledge without confin ing oneself to Cassirer's pure phenomenology and purely rela</page><page sequence="52">666 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. tional concepì. Another regards the possibility of a meta physics — or basic thought — which is concerned with the act of being, which effects a transformation of thought and conception which go beyond those conceived by Cassirer, and which recaptures the sense of signifìcance of the existing whole and deals with it intelligibly, philosophically, not in the mode of mythic thought or poetry. (e) Coexistence and compatibility of symbolic forms. Cas sirer's account of symbolic forms suggests a problem which recurs in various forms. At times Cassirer seems to have been aware of it, but to my knowledge he never formulated it clearly and attempted to solve it. I should cali it the problem of the coexistence and compatibility of diverse symbolic forms in the same man. First, what is the relation of myth to the other forms? At times Cassirer regards myth as first historical ly: ali other forms have their origin in it, and only gradually eliminate its remnants3n. Hence there is no sharp temporal dividing line between myth and theoretical consciousness 372. On the other hand he refers to an originai totally unmingled state of the mythical world 373, implicitly contrasted with states in which it is mingled with other modes of thought. Consider the problem, then. As Cassirer has elaborated at length in his second volume, mythic thought has a unique world view and a characteristic mode of conception affecting ali relation ships. It is diverse not only from theoretical thought but also from « language ». Yet, prior to his study of myth Cassirer had worked out the developments of « language » as a symbolic form, from the most primitive stages of mimetic sensuous expression to its striving toward pure signifìcation. The same primitive man, then, supposedly had two diverse world views and modes of conceptualization. What is the relation between the two, and what sort of language did mythic consciousness employ, diverse from the linguistic sym bolic form of primitive man? Moreover, within mythic thought Cassirer finds two basic orientations in space consciousness: one corresponding to the structure of the human body; the other based on the opposition of light-darkness and sacred 371 PhSF II, xiv-xvi. 372 PhSF II, xvii. 373 PhSF II, 75.</page><page sequence="53">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 667 profane. He never adverts to the problem of their compati bility. Finally, though there is a progress in concept formation, culminating in scientific thought, stili the diverse symbolic forms are simply diverse, not better or worse. They are ali part of the full human culture, of the achievement of man's symbolizing activity. Presumably, then, modem man can live with ali of them. The only hint of a solution which I have noticed in Cassirer is this: the contente of mythical conscious ness form a self-enclosed realm and possess a common tonality, by which they are distinguished from the contents of com mon, everyday, empirical existenceS74. Even this distinction of realms, however, leaves the problem intact, since mythical consciousness projects ali reality and ali events into the fun damental opposition of the sacred and the profane 375. One might suggest a solution in terms of Cassirer's am bivalent use of the term « symbolic form »: as mode of thought, and as particular kind of symbol. Thus, myth and language would be two diiferent modes, but myth would use, along with other kinds of symbols, language as a discursive symbolic form. And stili the problem remains: the same primitive man would have two fundamentally diiferent modes of thought. The difficulty is heightened by Cassirer's method of pure phenomenology of the contents of consciousness, and his ideal of purely relational, functional concepts. It would be possible to solve the problem of coexistence and compatibility in terms of one subject operating in different realms, realms which are not always clearly differentiated. But in Cassirer's philosophical account, there is no longer a « subject » but only analogous sets of relations in the contents of « consciousness ». The sets of relations themselves are the modes of consciousness, and they are the pseudo-operators too: myth, language, art, theoretical thought, etc. Consequently there is an obscurity not of how someone is operating, but of which pseudo-operator is active. Both the question and the answer, in fact, lie beyond Cassirer's method. It is only in a consideration which regards real subjects that the problem of coexistence and compatibility can be proposed, and only in such a consideration of the man 374 PhSF II, 74. 373 PhSF II, 75.</page><page sequence="54">668 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. who knows, and of the real world in which he lives, that an answer can be worked out. B. - Langer's Theory of Art Susanne Langer herself marked her distance from the idealist-critical position. Acknowledging that most philosophy of art has been related to the idealist tradition, she wrote that she did not believe that the idealist interpretation of reality is necessary to the recognition of art as a symbolic form. « ... The study of symbol and meaning is a starting-point of philosophy, not a derivative from Cartesian, Humean, or Kantian premises... » 376 The idealists' achievements in the study of non-discursive symbols have a value independent of their philosophical settings. The great generative idea in their theory of symbols is that of the transformational nature of human understanding. The vitality of that idea is shown es pecially in this: that a work like hers, coming not from idealist, but from logicai, interest, has been actuated by the same idea. Appropriating the results of Cassirer's work, Langer went on to study the structures of the symbols proper to the indi viduai arts, and her analysis has produced a rich yield. Her work complements that of Cassirer not only by adding the study of another kind of symbolic form, but also by stressing other factors in the role of the symbol. Going beyond Cas sirer's pure phenomenology, Langer has insisted more on in sight, intuition, understanding of real life and experience. She brings out the isomorphism, or likeness of logicai form, be tween the symbol and the real human feeling which the artist has understood. Consequently, she offers elements which con tribute further toward an eventual theory of knowledge. She herself insists that the art symbol, expressing insight into hu man feeling, can serve as an image which the psychologist can study with great profit. Langer's great achievement, in my opinion, is her account of the proper structures of the many art symbols which she has analyzed. I do not pretend to judge with personal com 376 PhNK, Preface to the First Edition, ρ. vili.</page><page sequence="55">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 669 petence in this area: it would be hard to find a critic com petent in ali the arts and sciences treated by Cassirer and Langer, and also in a metaphysics and theory of knowledge which would make it possible to locate their work in a larger field, surveyed from a higher point of view. I simply express my admiration for her keen appreciation of many arts, her intimate knowledge of a vast literature on artistic experience and theory, her penetrating critique of the work of other theorists, and her own reasonable account of the art symbol. Beyond her analysis of the particular art symbols, she has made notable contributions to the development of a general theory. Her account of non-generalizing abstraction is an ad vance beyond Cassirer's. The cumulative effect of her treat ments of presentational or metaphorical symbol suggests what may be the only ultimate basis for a satisfactory distinction of kinds of symbols. « Presentational » seems to me to be the more general no tion, and perhaps it would be helpful to limit « metaphorical » to the case of verbal presentational symbols. Underlying ali presentational symbol is the basic analogy of things, as a consequence of which the form of one (with the heightening and signifìcance achieved by the processes of abstraction) is presented whole to suggest another which it resembles. Re semblance may be a matter of similarity not merely of form but also of emotive character 377. I have mentioned Langer's going beyond Cassirer in her stress on insight into real feeling, whether it be the feeling which the artist himself has experienced, or that of others. To this extent, Langer is « realistic », not limited to the purely phenomenological method of Cassirer. I should say her own data suggest extending the notion of insight: the artist has insight not only into real human feeling, but also into the « nature » of the world and of man. He expresses an insight into human understanding and feeling, into human experience of the world and of human life as colored by feeling. This suggestion of mine may mean more to others than to Mrs. Langer, for she takes « feeling » in a broad sense which would include thought. 377 See above, ρ. 621, and note 205.</page><page sequence="56">670 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. There is a strange tura in Langer's thought on the dance. In accordance with her theory of symbol and semblance, the dance form itself is a semblance, creating an illusion, express ing insight into feeling. The feeling is real human feeling. The powers which are sensed as acting are themselves illusory. Primitive dance, consistently with the pattern of mythical con sciousness, expressed feeling regarding the play of forces or powers which were considered real: this was an element of delusion. The modem dance, an art form, is fully conscious of the illusory status of the symbol, and does not regard the powers as real. It keeps the legacy of the great illusions, without being dependent on delusions. In this line of reasoning, more than a theory of symbol is operative. There is an unannounced intervention of Langer's « scientific » and « philosophical » judgment on the « reality » of the forces or powers represented as active in the dance form. The principle invoked here is this: « Ali forces that cannot be scientifically established and measured must be regarded from the philosophical standpoint, as illusory; if, therefore, such forces appear to be part of our direct experience, they are ' virtual ', i.e. non-actual semblances. This applies to chthonic powers, divine powers, fates and spells and ali mystic agen cies... » 378 Two things should be noted here: the limits of « the philosophical standpoint » and the breadth of the affirma tion concerning the « illusory ». The philosophy which Langer has in mind evidently is limited to what can be verified and measured by a mathematical type of empirical science. It is understandable that for such a philosophy nothing has mean ing or « reality » except what is « scientifically established and measured ». Anything else falls outside its method, and has no meaning or reality according to that method. The case is analogous to the limitations of the method of pure phenomen ology: within the limits of that method, any question concern ing the « thing in itself » is a mistake in formulation. So much for the limits of the philosophy in question. The breadth of Langer's affirmation far exceeds the range of her philosophy. At most she could asserì that for such a philosophy any other forces are illusory. Until she performs the difficult task of 373 FF, 188: see above, p. 640,</page><page sequence="57">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 671 showing that this is the only philosophy possible, she has no grounds for her sweeping assertion. I make no defense of the « reality » of « chthonic powers » or of any creations of the mythical consciousness. I am prepared to affirm the reality of a Power which cannot be « scientifically established and measured » by any means at the disposai of empirical science. Langer's sweeping « de mythologizing » is another instance of the intrusion of a very limited « philosophy » into an area in which it has no com petency. Though Langer has not worked at the problems of the unique structure of the Christian sacrament as a symbol, many elements in her treatment of art forms afEord interesting points for comparison and contrast. Literature, creating the illusion of life in the mode of a virtual past, a virtual history which is closed, is both like and unlike the sacrament, which expresses the mystery not only of a past saving action, but of a present action tending to a future consummation. Dance may be com pared to the sacrament for its richness and complexity, and for its hegemony over many art materials. Drama resembles the sacrament in its use of other materials besides language, its semblance of action springing from the past and oriented toward the future, the importance of words in which action reaches its peaks, the cumulative form of its total action, and a certain abstraction and reincarnation of the motion and rhythm of living. The sacrament differs from drama generally in its expression of the great importance of a past saving action. It differs from comedy in that it is not the expression of fortune, nor of sheer human vitality: rather it expresses the mystery of a higher action entering man's life to bring him to respond in the realization of a more-than-human poten tial. Though the sacrament resembles tragedy in expressing somehow the rhythm of growth and full realization of a per sonality, it does not express the mystery of fate, decline, and self-consummation ending with death. Though the question is old and much-debated, it seems that there can be no Chris tian tragedy in the classic sense. There are certain similarities of symbolic elements and techniques, but the Christian world view and life view differ from those of classic tragic drama, and there is a fundamental difference in the insight into a more-than-human experience and vital feeling.</page><page sequence="58">672 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. Lyric poetry seems to offer points of comparison not with the essential symbolism of the sacramentai or sacrificai action, but with what may be called the complementary symbolism by which the Church expresses its feeling, its devotion and response to the divine action. The « time » of liturgical action differs from mythic time, from the « timelessness » of lyric, and from the time of drama. Music, involving the problems of the complementary roles of composer, director, and per former, affords some analogy with the sacrament, in which one must distinguish the roles of Christ, the Church as a whole directing the liturgical action, and the individuai min ister performing it. For the most part, the work of both Cassirer and Langer was done in one area of the whole field within which the symbol is to be situated and understood. They concentrated on the questione concerning the formation of the symbol. Ap propriating their achievements, one may move out in various directions to grasp elements necessary for a general theory of the symbol. Some questions regard the whole world of things and persons in interaction, existing and operating in a manifold of intelligible dynamic relations. It is insight into this whole complex realm that is expressed in the whole range of symbols. Further questions regarding the formation of the symbol seek a more complete account of man, the symbol-maker. Beyond the mere structures of the contents of consciousness studied by Cassirer, and beyond the rather vague notions of mind developed thus far by Langer, further questions regard a full theory of man, of the principles and dynamic structure of the cognitive, afFective, and volitional operations which help to understand further the mystery of the symbol. Other questions regard man, the community of men, as symbol-users, the manifold role of the symbol in communica tion, interpersonal influence and relations, and the complex field of action which affects the rest of the universe known and influenced by man. The symbol-ma^er is also an irre pressible symbol-developer, for symbols gather meaning as</page><page sequence="59">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 673 they go. They take ori a manifold of meanings, and set endless tasks for the interprete!·. Ali particular views of the symbol, ali elaborations of structures in particular areas, drive the searcher to seek a higher point of view from which the whole field may be surveyed and embraced in a comprehensive account. Knowing, feeling, and willing are ali modes of being, and there is a basic mode of thought which can deal with them in its uni versa! consideration of the modes of being. It is a kind of metaphysics which is different from those kinds which many have rejected with good reason, a mode of thought which will do for ali particular conceptions what physics does for the particular space and time of the individuai observer. It will not wipe them out, but make them more intelligible by locat ing them in the whole intelligible field which somehow de fines them. Finally, in the context of a full theory of symbol, the theologian may attempi to determine the proper structures and functions of the Christian sacrament as a symbol. It is in partial preparation for such a work that this study of Cassirer and Langer has been done. I hope to present an essay toward a general synthesis of symbolism, and an ap plication to the Christian sacrament in a work which is now being prepared. William A. Van Roo, SJ. William A. Van Roo, SJ.</page><page sequence="60">674 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. RÉSUMÉ A. — Théorie générale. — Langer n'a pas élaboré elle-mème une théorie générale du symbole artistique. Néanmoins, bon nombre de notions générales reviennent dans ses oeuvres. Elles sont ici réu nies en vue de faciliter l'exposé qui sera fait de la manière dont elle traite les formes propres à chaque art. 1. — Expression de l'intuition1. Le symbole artistique exprime l'intuition de l'artiste à l'égard des comportements humains. 2. — Forme significative, et concepts correspondants. La forme significative est l'essence de tout art, étant donné que l'oeuvre d'art est une création dont la fonction symbolique est l'expression logique. La beauté de l'oeuvre d'art est sa forme expressive. L'abstraction est le processus de création d'une forme symbolique, détachée du reste du monde. Dans l'art, l'abstraction ne généralise pas; au con traire elle fait apparaitre un sentiment particulier, qu'elle incarne dans l'art symbolique. C'est une abstraction « présentationnelle » ou métaphorique. L'un de ses facteurs déterminants est la méta phore sensible, basée sur l'équivalence symbolique de sensations ayant un caractère émotif commun. L'art symbolique présente une image, une apparence, une illusion, où les formes sensibles suscep tibles d'ètre pergues sont abstraites de leur contexte habit'uel. 3. — Le symbole non discursif est différent du langage discursif. Dans ce dernier intervieni une corrélation rigoureuse, un à un, entre mots et concepts; la loi est celle d'un ordre linéaire, défini, successif. Les symboles non discursifs ne disposent ni de vocabu laire ni de définitions, et ne peuvent ètre traduits. Le symbole non discursif est une présentation directe d'un objet individuel; ses lois sont celles de l'imagination. Le principe premier de sa projection est la Darstellbarkeit : l'aptitude à étre exhibé. Sa fonc tion est d'exprimer des expériences qui ne sont pas accessibles à une projection discursive et linéaire. La forme non discursive est caractérisée par un au delà de la détermination : ambivalence, condensation, simultanéité. L'oeuvre d'art est un symbole premier: simple et indivisible. Elle est proprement intraduisible. B. — Quelques formes particulìères d'art. — 1. La musique est un analogue sonore de la vie émotive. Ses éléments sont des 1 II n'existe aucune traduction frangaise de « in-sight » = voir l'inté rieur en profondeur. Intuition est la traduction la moins défectueuse.</page><page sequence="61">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 675 formes sonores en mouvement; mouvement qui est pure apparence, qui intervient dans le domarne de la durée pure, et diffère par suite du temps qui mesure notre vie publique et privée. La musique crée un ordre de temps virtuel, l'apparence d'un mouvement orga nique, qui exprime l'intuition sur le rythme de la vie. 2. — La danse crée l'illusion d'un domaine virtuel de puissance. Son abstraction fondamentale est la gesticulation virtuelle: non pas simplement le mouvement vital actuel, mais virtuel, gesticulation logiquement expressive, qui semble jaillir du sentiment. Les mouve ments du danseur paraissent provenir de forces venues d'au-delà de l'exécutant. 3. — La poesie est une des formes de la littérature. Elle crée l'illusion de la vie sous forme d'un passé virtuel. Son abstraction fondamentale consiste à créer l'apparence d'expériences, qui com portent une simplification des événements considérés, et irne exalta tion de la valeur émotionnelle, spécialement en poésie lyrique. Le lyrisme fait l'emploi le plus large de matériaux purement verbaux: sons, rythmes, assonances, et associations sensibles. Son motif est d'ordinaire seulement une pensée, une vision, une humeur, ou une émotion poignante, exprimée dans un présent intemporel. 4. — Le drame crée l'illusion de l'histoire virtuelle sous la forme d'un futur virtuel. Son abstraction fondamentale est l'acte, jailli du passé et projeté vers le futur qui vieni. Il n'est pas fait de mots, encore que le discours soit tout ce que compose le poète. Le discours est ici d'un genre spécial: la quintessence de l'action, enveloppée ■ en de longues séries de moments culminants dans l'action. La comédie exprime le pur sens de la vie, du sort, et le rythme d'une vitalité absolue. La tragèdie a le rythme de la crois sance et de la pleine réalisation d'une personnalité. Elle exprime le sentiment produit par la contemplation de la vie, en tant que mouvement ordonné à l'autoconsommation. Reflexions A. — La philosophie de Cassirer au sujet des formes symboli ques. — 1. Ses mérites. — Cassirer dépasse la critique kantienne du fait qu'il reconnaìt la fonction formative de l'esprit humain dans la perception, et qu'il analyse un champ plus vaste de formation de concepì. En conséquence il met en évidence la valeur propre du mythe, de la religion, de l'art, aussi bien que de la science. En outre, avec sa connaissance des mathématiques et de la physique moder nes, il va au-delà de Kant dans l'étude de la formation des concepts</page><page sequence="62">676 WILLIAM A. VAN ROO, S. I. et de la méthode proprement scientifiques. Bien que sa théorie du concept soit inadéquate, il a contribué à l'intelligence des caracté ristiques propres à toute conception. En insistant sur l'activité for matrice de l'esprit humain, Cassirer met en évidence les défauts du pur empirisme, du sensationnisme, de l'associationnisme, du beha viourisme. 2. Limites et questions en suspens. — Tandis qu'il traite le mythe en tant que forme de conscience, Cassirer laisse ouvertes les questions qui concernent les symboles particuliers employés dans la pensée mythique. Les relations du langage avec les symboles scientifiques et avec d'autres formes de langage scientifique, techni que, philosophique, sont obscures. La manière dont il traite le sym bolisme religieux n'est pas adéquate, et les questions qui se rappor tent au symbolisme sacramentai chrétien demeurent ouvertes. D'autres problèmes sont ouverts: ils concernent le rève, et une espèce de la métaphysique ignorée de Cassirer. Sa classification des symboles ne donne pas entière satisfaction. Sa phénoménologie pure ne peut accepter des questions qui sont raisonnables sous d'autres points de vue: qu'il s'agisse du róle de la chose-en-soi, du sujet lui-mème exactement défini, et en général de la relation réci proque entre l'ontologique et le phénoménal. En outre, sa notion de concept scientifique purement relatif, fonctionnel, rend impossible la considération des objets ou des sujets au niveau scientifique. Enfin les problèmes concernant la coexistence et la compatibilité des diverses formes symboliques échappent à la méthode de Cassirer. B. — La théorie de l'art suivant Langer. — Langer complète Cassirer doublement: elle introduit l'étude d'un autre genre de symbole, et elle insiste sur le róle de l'intuition dans la vie réelle et l'expérience. Son grand apport est la considération qu'elle accorde à la structure propre à de nombreux symboles artistiques. Ses considérations sur l'abstraction non généralisante et sur le symbole présentatif contribuent à l'élaboration d'une théorie générale. Sa théorie de la danse comporte une « démythisation » radicale, qui rend inopérant un exposé adéquat du sacrement chrétien en tant que symbole. Nombre d'éléments dans ses considérations sur cha que art particulier offrent des bases pour des comparaisons fécon des avec la structure du sacrement chrétien. Cassirer et Langer ont l'un et l'autre poussé leurs recherches dans le domaine de la formation du symbole. On peut s'approprier les résultats acquis et pousser ensuite plus loin, en directions di verses, la recherche d'autres éléments nécessaires pour la construc tion d'une théorie générale du symbole. Les autres questions, con cernent l'ensemble de l'univers, choses et personnes, dont l'intuition</page><page sequence="63">SYMBOL ACCORDING ΤΟ CASSIRER AND LANGER 677 s'exprime en symboles; une exposition intégrale de l'homme en tant qu'inventeur de symboles et de l'homme en tant qu'usageur de symboles: l'un et l'autre modifiant continuellement leurs sym boles, et rendant par là interminable la tàche de les interpréter. Manquent enfin une métaphysique qui permettrait de situer l'activité symbolisante dans une étude universelle des modes d'ètre ; — et une théologie qui pourrait rendre compie de la structure exacte des sacrements chrétiens en tant que symboles, et de leurs fonctions.</page></plain_text>
