In  August 1988 Malcolm Browne wrote in the New York Times, “A century and a  quarter after chemists first deduced the shape of the benzene ring from its  chemical behavior, microscopists have at last obtained a direct image of this  distinctive and vital molecular structure.”1 Traveling its long journey from  1825 to 1988, benzene fulfilled our visual expectations and chemists sat  back, stunned by the rightness of our collective aesthetic impulse. We had  seen the unknowable. Or had we? Can we (fig. 1)? Yes, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) image of benzene satis- fied our epistemic, ontological, and aesthetic desires, but what we were really  seeing, and how it came to be what we “saw,” is a story worth telling. The  story of benzene encapsulates almost all that we need to know to understand  nanoaesthetics’ seemingly disparate subject materials, from buckyballs to  self-assembling systems to probe microscopy.2 Benzene is the progenitor, the  supermodel, for understanding how chemists mediate, simulate, and aes- theticize the unvisualizable, intangible, and ultimately unknowable, nano- world of molecules and atoms. The historical road between Michael Faraday’s identification of “bicar- buret of hydrogen” in whale oil in 1825 to Friedrich August Kekulé’s 1865  determination of benzene’s “structure” is an oft-told tale in chemistry.3 A  highly unsaturated compound with the molecular formula C6H6, benzene’s  relative lack of chemical reactivity was an enigma to nineteenth-century  chemists. In addition, once reacted it appeared to produce only one isomer  of any monosubstituted compound and three of any disubstituted com- pound, a reactivity pattern previously unknown in chemistry. Built fast upon  the heels of the development of structural formulas in chemistry, a small  aBstract  Rooted in the history of the representation of benzene, this paper examines the evolution  of nanoaesthetics from the 1985 discovery of buckminsterfullerene forward, including the aesthetics of  molecular machines and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). It highlights buckminsterfullerene’s Pla- tonic aesthetics, the aesthetic relationship of nanocars and molecular switches to Boyle’s seventeenth- century mechanistic philosophy and twentieth-century machine aesthetics, and the photographic  aesthetics of SPM. representations  117.

I turned my chair to the fire and dozed. Again the atoms were gam- boling before my eyes. . . . My mental eye, rendered more acute by the repeated  visions of the kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conforma- tion; long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in  snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of  its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of light- ning I awoke.6 2 Representations </page> <page sequence="3"> figure 2. Examples of nineteenth-century representations of benzene.

Beyond its formal similarities to benzene’s cyclic valance structure, the ouro- boros provides a resplendent visual metaphor for Kekulé’s conceptual tautol- ogy; reiterative, yet scientifically generative, benzene’s representational  beginning, like the snake’s tail, embeds its end. A conventional story of a sci- entific stroke of genius, recollected in Wordsworthian tranquility, Kekulé’s  snake validated his scientific insight, his scientific insight validated his likely  apocryphal daydream and simultaneously cemented a visual legacy for chem- istry where structure begets properties and properties recapitulate structure.  Outside of Kekulé’s, most of the early structures proposed for benzene  represent incomprehensible anachronisms to twenty-first-century chemists.  As Pierre Laszlo writes, in the late nineteenth century structural formulas  embodied “reactivity data as a static structure. And the latter was considered  as a map, rather than as an actual spatial geometry for the molecule  depicted.” Such structures “were much closer to a topographical than to a  geometrical representation.”7 Created during a century when scientists heat- edly debated the existence of atoms, and prior to the electron’s discovery,  there was no consensus among chemists as to what these structures repre- sented. Explanations for the observed valency (that is, the “atom-fixing  power”) of the atoms within these structures were quite varied and included,   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> among others, theories based on electrochemical interactions, gravitational  forces, and the dynamic motions of the particles of matter.8 We now know  that none of these explanations were correct; yet, as for benzene, chemists  continue to use nineteenth-century molecular representations to postulate  and communicate chemical information. The robustness of Kekulé’s ben- zene structure over time can be attributed to the inherent ingenuity of its  form, which, like a glass that can hold wine, water, or sand, may accept a  plethora of theoretical contents. For chemists today such representations  embody the empirically successful theories of a collective disciplinary past  and provide an adaptive container for modern chemical concepts; the visual  and conventional molecular structures of the nineteenth century become  imbued with the mathematical framework of chemistry developed during  the early twentieth century. Thus, rather than a bond that acts as a “tie which  enable[s] an element . . . to attach itself to one or more atoms of other ele- ments” with “no hypothesis as to the nature of the connection,” chemists  now envision bonds as a space of high electron density probability (that is, a  molecular orbital) between two atomic nuclei.9 Through this melding of  twentieth-century theory and nineteenth-century structure, molecular repre- sentations have shifted from empirically useful topological heuristics to met- aphoric models with precise and predictive theoretical value.  It is an understatement to say that the conceptual distance between a  clear liquid and the structural formula of benzene, or of any molecule’s  physical form and its representation, is complex; moreover, an examination  of nanoaesthetics ultimately relies on the acknowledgment that molecular  representations are constitutive and discrete scientific entities, not simple  heuristics or models that merely illustrate the real object. We can readily  apply Bruno Latour’s signifiers for constructed scientific objects to deter- mine the status of benzene, or any molecular representation, as an object:  (1) scientifically productive, the molecular representation of benzene yields  research and journal articles, in addition to its chemical uses (that is, it is a  constitutive object); (2) benzene’s representation originates from a precise  time and space (or, in scientific parlance—“it was discovered”); and (3) ben- zene’s structure has proven immutable to the accumulated techniques and  uses applied to it since its inscription in the scientific literature.10 Benzene has meaning for most molecular scientists. But, as an object,  what exactly formulates that meaning? Do the representations of benzene or  benzene itself emblematize its objective, iconic status? Benzene’s ready dis- tinguishability from other similar structures underscores its representation  as a self-contained scientific entity. By contrast, as a chemical substance, we  distinguish benzene from other clear liquids only with difficulty. Theodore  Brown has shown us that molecular representations are “extended meta- phors [that] give rise to metaphorical entailments . . . [which] commonly  4 representat ions </page> <page sequence="5"> form the basis for theory formation.”11 This scientifically generative aspect of  molecular representations also gives them aesthetic potency, where, as phi- losopher of chemistry Joachim Schummer writes, “It is the molecules [and  here he means the representations of the molecules], and only the mole- cules, for which claims of beauty and artistic creativity are justified, no mat- ter what sensual qualities the corresponding materials have.”12 There are various ways to understand molecular aesthetics.13 Within the  conceptual framework of Plato’s ideal Forms, molecules like benzene, as  abstract intellectual objects dissociated from our tactile senses, are reflected  in objects in the tangible world; perfect, unknowable universals, molecules  underlie our perceived reality. According to Plato, the four elements of fire,  air, water, and earth compose the world as we know it, and, through a com- plex line of geometric reasoning, he assigns these elements to four founda- tional ideal Forms. These ideal Forms are the pyramid, as a “solid which is the  original element and seed of fire”; the octahedron, as “intermediate in size”  and, therefore airlike; the icosahedron, because as the “greatest” (that is, larg- est) body, it reflects water; and the cube, “for earth is the most immoveable of  the four and the most plastic of all bodies.”14 Much like molecules, these four  ideal Forms were described “to be so small that no single particle of any of  the four kinds is seen by us on account of their smallness: but when many of  them are collected together their aggregates are seen.”15 The visualized forms  of these elements, the Platonic solids, like molecular representations, provide  us with the ability to grasp the unknowable realm of the real and thus to gain  access to true knowledge, but they are themselves imperfect simulacra. Simi- larly, from Timeaus’s geometrically based determination that the ideal Forms  are the most beautiful of the “infinite forms” we may infer that their repre- sentations as the Platonic solids are also beautiful, but only imperfectly so.16 Contemporary chemists and mathematicians have lost sight of the philo- sophical origins that anchor the beauty of the ideal Forms, and there has  been a slippage between concept and form. As a result, the Platonic solids,  along with many other geometric forms such as the hexagonal representa- tion of benzene and its valance isomers, are now considered beautiful, and  molecular representations of the Platonic solids manifest as aesthetic objects  of synthetic desire with a material result: organic chemists have synthesized  cubane, dodecahedrane, and substituted forms of tetrahedrane.17 Cubane  and tetra-t-butyltetrahedrane are high-energy, crystalline solids with melting  points of 131 and 135 degrees Celsius, respectively.18 Virtually indistinguish- able physically, only molecular representations individuate and aestheticize  them as molecular icons (fig. 3). With the discovery of buckminsterfullerene, the aesthetic fascination  with carbon-based polyhedral structures extended to nanotechnology (fig. 4).

Both form in the soot produced by petroleum products, display chem- ical aromaticity, have spectral data that indicates a high degree of symmetry,  and represent as static, iconic, ideal molecular forms. In a surprising paral- lel, the story of buckminsterfullerene’s discovery has become the stuff of  chemical legend, following a narrative trajectory similar to benzene’s, from  intriguing experimental evidence, through molecular mystery, and finally to  a revelatory, sustaining, and generative structural entity. Evidence of bucky- ball was first observed as a peak in a “time of flight mass spectra of carbon  clusters prepared by laser vaporization of graphite and cooled in a super- sonic beam” corresponding to a cluster containing sixty carbon atoms.19  Although this was not what initially interested the researchers (Robert F. Curl,  Harold W. Kroto, Richard E. Smalley, and graduate students James R. Heath  and Sean C. O’Brien), nor what they were seeking, the preponderance of  this peak in the mass-spectrum (indicative of a chemical species with particu- lar stability) pointed them to an alternate, unexpected path of inquiry, and  ultimately defined their scientific careers. Curl, Kroto, and Smalley received  the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996.  Initially, like benzene prior to Kekulé’s “discovery,” the molecular struc- ture associated with the C60 peak was unclear; at that time the known allo- tropes of carbon (stable compounds that contain only carbon) included  only forms of diamond and graphite. And as for Kekulé’s benzene dream,  the self-reporting of the “discovery” of the structure of buckminsterfullerene  played a crucial role in cementing its legendary molecular status. Though  not quite as romantic as daydreaming in front of a fire, the saga of buckmin- sterfullerene typifies the “special kind of laboratory discourse” that, as Hans- Jörg Rheinberger writes, produces “unique laboratory scripts somewhere  between the dense and impenetrable experimental arrangement on the one  hand and the articulated concept on the other, between the scientist at the  bench and the scientist as the author of a scientific paper”: after a long day  in the lab the scientists went out to eat Mexican food, discuss, and scribble  possible structures for C60 on napkins; this discussion, as casual as it seems  in its retelling, was based on a common assumption among them that the  structure must include the six-membered rings from the graphite used to  generate the C60 peak.20 Later, at home, Smalley cut hexagons and then  pentagons out of paper and, after playing with them for a while, fit them  together (at 3:00 a.m.) into—aha!—a soccer ball.21  Notable as their “serendipitous” discovery was, perhaps more remarkable  was the publication of the speculative, unsubstantiated, molecular structure of  buckyball (in the guise of a soccer ball) as a letter to Nature entitled “C60: Buck- minsterfullerene” before there was clear experimental evidence of its exis- tence.22 Breaching the semi-private realm of the research group where   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> “epistemic things are no longer private dreams but not yet sanctioned facts,”  they leapt the hurdles of proof normally necessary for scientific publication.23  In fact, they waited five years, until other researchers discovered an alternate  method for the production of buckyball in significant quality and purity, to  spectroscopically confirm their theoretically conjectured structure.24 Clearly,  aesthetics, in part, drove the authors’ “unusually beautiful (and probably  unique) choice” of “the truncated icosahedron” and compelled its publication  in one of the most important scientific journals before completion of the evi- dence.25 As Kroto wrote in his 1996 Nobel Prize lecture, “I remember thinking  that the molecule was so beautiful that it just had to be right—and anyway even  if it were not, everybody would surely love it, which they did—eventually!”26  Since its baptism as buckminsterfullerene, images of its structure have  proliferated. Visually, Smalley’s paper buckyball, like the truncated icosahe- dron (one of the thirteen Archimedean solids) studied by mathematicians  for centuries, emphasized the surfaces rather than the vertices of the model;  the photograph of a soccer ball included in the letter to Nature reinforced  this emphasis.27 The cover of the same issue of Nature, however, translated  the structure into something more familiar to chemists: a valence structure.  Valance structures at their simplest are line drawings (normally drawn by  hand or, when for publication, with a specialized molecular graphics pro- gram) that indicate the atomic connectivity within a molecule, where each  line is a two-electron bond and each vertex an atom (in the case of buckmin- sterfullerene, a carbon atom); often they communicate a sense of the mole- cule’s spatial geometry, while ignoring subtler aspects of bonding such as  electron densities and polarizabilities. Valence structures reduce experimen- tal evidence, stripping it bare of noise, impurities, and the fact that chemists  collect most chemical and spectroscopic data from kinetic molecular ensem- bles, presenting instead an idealized abstraction of a single, motionless, mol- ecule. The white line drawing of buckminsterfullerene on the November  14th, 1985, cover of Nature did just this, but presumably to enhance its visual  appeal, while connecting the molecule to interstellar space (at that time the  authors thought it “a feasible constituent of interstellar dust”); the editors  displayed it on a black background in a cloud of white dots, as though it  were embedded in a sphere of stars far off in space.28 Since that time, repre- sentations of buckyball, until STM captured it in 1990, have remained fairly  close to this original image—minus the stars.29 Some are in color, others  replace the vertices with balls to more explicitly indicate them as atoms (that  is, ball and stick models), and some are space-filling (molecular models that  represent the atoms as balls sized relative to the radius of their electron  clouds, abandoning lines depicting bonds), but in essence they remain true  to the visual vocabulary of chemical structures established in the late nine- teenth century as epitomized by benzene.  8 representat ions </page> <page sequence="9"> Its compelling elegant molecular form, the fit of its experimental proper- ties with its structural manifestation, and its subsequent status as the third  known allotrope of carbon imbue buckminsterfullerene with a primal Platonic  essence. Beyond its Platonic associations, however, the molecular representa- tion of buckyball is aesthetically potent because it simulates a real-world  object—in this case a soccer ball. Schummer posits that the aesthetics associ- ated with molecular systems that look like ordinary objects are the result of the  “interpretive ambiguity” established by the link between two disparate symbolic  domains, or a Gestalt switch.30 Within this philosophical framework a molecule  that looks like a soccer ball will necessarily elicit an aesthetic response. Buck- minsterfullerene’s static valence structure was not only scientifically inspired  but also a source of scientific inspiration that immediately led to speculation  about its potential applications. While its structural determination was a result  of scientific inspiration, the structure itself became a source of inspiration. In  theory it could serve as a molecular ball bearing, encapsulate other atoms to  form host-guest complexes, and tether medicinals, ball and chain fashion, to its  surface for site-specific drug delivery.31 Not only does it look like a real-world  object; it theoretically acts like one too. Valence structures of buckyballs encap- sulating and tethering other atoms and molecules have become the most com- mon variants of the standard image of the molecule. These representations  relocated buckminsterfullerene from just another beautiful molecular form  into the realm of a (nano)technological object—a protomolecular machine  that “put the nano into nanochemistry.”32  Although molecular machines find their prototype in buckminsterfuller- ene, and the molecule sometimes serves as a component in molecular  machines, chemists do not view it as an actual molecular machine.33 Chemists  define molecular machines as synthetic mechanico-functional supramolecu- lar systems that respond kinetically to an external stimulus. Typically, molecu- lar machines contain switches that can be turned on or off, opened or closed,  using various forms of energy (light, radio frequency, electrochemical) to  gate molecular motions. Implicit in the concept of a switch is the ability to  animate actions, such as turning on a light. In fact, many molecular switches  start or stop the flow of electrons within “molecular wires.” Fraser Stoddart’s  light-gated stop-go molecular shuttle exemplifies typical molecular switches  (fig. 5).34 Nanoscientists most often illustrate molecular switches with dia- grams that juxtapose molecular structures and “technomorphs.” Chemist  James Tour’s illustration of the “first motorized nanocar,” where the standard  molecular representations E (a valence structure) and F (a space-filling  model) are placed within the same figure as the technomorphs A–D, exem- plifies these conventions (fig. 6). 35 As fully mechanized images, techno- morphs provide conceptual accessibility to nonchemists, but have absolutely  no chemical meaning.36  Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 9 </page> <page sequence="10"> figure 5.  Fraser Stoddart’s molecular shuttle. Copyright © 2009  American Chemical Society. Aesthetically, according to Schummer, if we place the two different  sign systems, one of which lacks visual ambiguity, side by side, we resolve  the tension of the Gestalt switch associated with the “interpretive ambigu- ity” embedded in the standard representations of molecules that look  like real-world objects.37 An alternate and opposing perspective on the  juxtapositional aesthetics of nanochemical machines comes from Bar- bara Maria Stafford’s analysis of early modern European emblems and  heraldic shields where “such tiled images or two-dimensional spatial  groupings of unit cells set side by side allow the viewer to compare many  different situations simultaneously. Interlocking decontextualizes ordi- nary objects and recontextualizes them as strange.”38 Unlike Schummer’s  analysis, which claims that the aesthetics of such systems comes from a  sense of familiarizing dissimilar objects within a frame, here they are  10 representat ions </page> <page sequence="11"> figure 6.  James Tour’s propulsion scheme for the motorized nanocar.  Copyright © 2007 American Chemical Society. defamiliarized, and this quality, as Stafford notes, calls attention to the  “virtuoso manipulation of material components” that articulates the arti- fice of their construction.39 Robert Boyle’s seventeenth-century mechanical framework for chemistry  provides another context for understanding the aesthetics of the static repre- sentations of nanomachines. Boyle postulated that the corpuscular nature of  matter was best understood in mechanical terms; or, put another way, each  corpuscle was a mechanical entity. He, and later mechanical philosophers  like Newton, believed that, as primordial structures, corpuscles mirrored the  mechanical motions and interactions of the natural world. Alan Chalmers  convincingly argues that because Boyle’s corpuscles possessed strict mechani- cal properties, they wholly avoided chemical atomism; they “reduced chemis- try to mechanism.”40 Like Plato’s ideal Forms, these corpuscles undergirded   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> figure 7.

Copyright © 1991–2007  Institute for Molecular Manufacturing,  www.imm.org. all matter and, though differentiated by their shape, size, and motion, were  not blatantly ideal Forms in a Platonic sense. In twenty-first century nanotech- nology, Boyle’s corpuscles manifest in a literalized mechanical world of mole- cules represented by the idealized form of the technomorph.41 Like Boyle’s  corpuscles, such depictions have minimal, or no, normative chemical struc- tural features, but possess an inertial impetus, in Boyle’s case a literal impetus  or “impressed force” contained in each corpuscle for mechanical action; tech- nomorphs statically depict molecular machines that contain within them the  potential for dynamics.42 Representationally, nanoscientists illustrate the con- cept of a molecular switch by juxtaposing two technomorphs side by side with  arrows in between that symbolically include the source of energy needed to  cause the switch to trigger (fig. 5).43 Although absolutely static, the conceptual  space between each structure creates our perception of a dynamic quality.  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations transform the static representational  nature of technomorphs necessitated by standard paper-based publication  practices into movies of a “molecule” moving on a computer screen. Although  slightly different representationally from the chemist’s typical technomorphs,  William Goddard’s MD simulations of Eric Drexel’s controversial molecular  nanogear illustrate this point (fig. 7).44 This MD movie tracks the movement  of the first generation of Eric Drexler’s nanogear over a twelve-picosecond  timeframe after the application of a rotational force to the simulated system.45  Careful viewing of MD movies reveals that initially only the interior core of the  gear rotates, but as time passes the entire system begins synchronously to  rotate and vibrate. Visually, such movies obviate our need to make conceptual  connections by doing it for us, like a flipbook that connects and animates illus- trations; they charm us into a false perception of molecular motion, while  simultaneously bridging the gap between Platonic and machine aesthetics.  12 representat ions </page> <page sequence="13"> Whether static or dynamic, the representational imaginings of molecular  machines communicate a machine aesthetic where form articulates function  above all else.46 Although we are accustomed to real-life machines, and are  therefore not impressed by their novelty, our sense of awe is recaptured by  images of nanomachines: they represent a physically unknowable realm “yet  express the ‘cold rationality’ of [their] designer.”47 Although they are not actu- ally machines, representations of nanomachines have the look and feel of  machines, and a sense of transparency that, like cutaway models, reveal “an  epiphany, [and] an avenue to knowledge.”48 They are at once idealized minia- ture machines that hold the promise of a nano-futurist-utopia of site-specific  drug delivery systems that heal us without detrimental side effects and potential  alternative energy sources that alleviate the geopolitical and environmental  damage wrought by petroleum. Technomorphs provide visual metaphors that  express a sense of molecular agency; they transform molecular machines, via  chemical and physical forces, from the inanimate into the animate. In addition  to molecular machines, the visual expressions of molecular agency inhabit both  static and dynamic representations in other types of nanochemical systems,  including those that mimic human forms and interactions, and yet others that  associate spontaneously and intermolecularly; NanoPutians exemplify the for- mer and self-assembling systems the latter (fig. 8).49 It might be easy to dismiss  Tour’s NanoPutians as mimetic representations of people akin to children’s  figure 8.  James Tour’s NanoPutians. Copyright © 2003 American  Chemical Society.  Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> stick-drawings; when understood in the context of other chemical and nanosci- entific representations, however, they have their own specific visual power.  From an organic chemist’s perspective, the valence structures of NanoPutians  chemically encode molecular representations in that they contain benzene  ring bodies, alkynyl legs and acetal moieties for heads, simultaneously generat- ing whimsical delight. Their particular aesthetic is best illustrated in compari- son to the nanochemical systems I have previously discussed. NanoPutians  share structural similarities to molecular representations like benzene, but ben- zene does not capture their aesthetic potency. Benzene’s aesthetic qualities  come from the rightness of the fit between its structural representation and the  underlying chemical theory of aromaticity, while NanoPutians provide no new  theoretical or pragmatic insights into chemistry. Their aesthetic is also distinct  from that of molecular machines. Molecular machines potentially act like  gears, switches, and rotors; NanoPutians like human beings. Neither syntheti- cally novel nor theoretically groundbreaking, NanoPutians’ resemblance to  humans alone makes them intriguing. As miniaturized human simulacra they  anthropomorphically link us to the nanoscale.  NanoPutians dance and hold hands but, like static technomorphs, have  an inertial dynamics: the animate energy of NanoPutians is embedded in the  structures but not acted out—they are frozen in time.50 In contrast, self- assembling systems express the dynamics of a perceived chemical agency by  performing overt kinetic acts; left on their own under the right conditions,  graphite sheets form cylindrical structures and “living” DNA and protein  molecules spontaneously assemble into supramolecular entities. Molecular  scientists often speak of chemical and biochemical self-organizing systems in  mechanical-teleological terms. As Nobel laureate Jean-Marie Lehn describes  of the self-assembly of an organometallic cylindrical superstructure: The steric and binding information contained in the ligand is read out by the metal  ions following a tetrahedral coordination algorithm. This process represents a fur- ther step in the control of the self-organization of large, complex supramolecular  architectures through molecular programming.51 Mechanistic agents of their own destiny, metal ions “read” and self-assembling  systems “spontaneously” generate, and sometimes self-replicate, while simulta- neously following algorithms “stored in the components and operate through  selective molecular interactions.”52 Driven by energetic forces, self-organizing  systems act like autonomous chemical entities. Self-assembly moves nanotech out of the purview of an aesthetics of scale  and into an aesthetics of temporality and ephemerality. If we look at Lehn’s  figure of the formation of “double helicate” and “triple helicate” structures  from a “mixture of oligobypyrimidine strands and of Cu(I) and Ni(II) ions  (fig. 9),” we see on the left side valence structures of the separated reactants  14 representat ions </page> <page sequence="15"> figure 9.  Jean-Marie Lehn’s self-assembling of double- and triple-helicate  structures. Copyright © (1993) National Academy of Sciences, USA. and on the right side the self-assembled products, where the molecular  structures encode their elegance as an instantaneous transformation of start- ing materials into a complex product.53 It is the space, the instant, between  reactants and products that captures our imagination. Linked by a sensation  of disruption—a moment of awe expressed in astonishment—it captures the  transient sensation of sublimity.54 Stafford argues that symbolically inter- locked visual systems represent and bind our neuronal processes. She writes,  “Just as the intarsia-like emblem is pieced together from a multiplicity of jux- taposed fragments, each of which belong to some dispersed, invisible whole,  assembly, synchronization, and the combination of complex streams of infor- mation are predicated on the coordination of features of a given datum  spread over an interconnected system.” In her words, such systems “com- press space and time.”55 In the blink of an eye, in the space over the arrow,  many become one. Molecular scientists have long been fascinated with this  unknowable space; we draw and computationally simulate “transition states”  between reactants and products, capturing fleeting moments in time into  structures on the page. We create faster and faster methods, like femtosec- ond spectroscopy, to try to home in on this inherently unknowable space.  Like Plato’s ideal Forms, they are inaccessible but ripe with imaginative  yearning.  In the context of this paper self-assembling molecular machines represent  particularly interesting self-organizing systems. Loosed from its biological obli- gations of replication and transcription, DNA can be optimized for the design   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> figure 10.

In the Science article “Folding DNA into Twisted and  Curved Nanoscale Shapes,” Hendrik Deitz and colleagues describe a method  for engineering DNA “through programmable self-assembly.”56 Employing  the techniques of “scaffolded-DNA-origami,” they demonstrate how to  design “a DNA bundle bearing three ‘teeth’ that is programmed to fold into  a half-circle with a 25-nm radius” and then used hierarchical assembly to  combine two of these bundles into a circular object that resembled a nanoscale  gear with six teeth.57 Using four quarter-circles, they also manufactured a  gear with twelve teeth. The nano-engineering used to manufacture these  structures interests scientists, yet most aesthetically fascinating is the trans- mission electron microscope (TEM) “photographs” of the 25–50 nanometer- sized gears and other twisted DNA structures (fig. 10). Although reported in  the popular press in a Wired article entitled “Self-Assembling DNA Makes  Super 3-D Nano Machines,” the mechanical aspect of these nanocogs is illu- sory; they are simply abstracted images of static machine parts.58 More  machinelike is the “nanoscale DNA box” designed, by means of self-assem- bly, at the Copenhagen Centre for DNA Nanotechnology.59 This “functional- ized DNA box” has an operable lid that opens with an oligonucleotide key,  giving it the feel of a dynamic molecular machine. Again, the most astonish- ing aspect of this technology is not the ability to design such a self-assembling  system, but the ability to capture “images” of the 42 3 36 3 36 nanometer  box in its closed and open states at the nanoscale using atomic force micros- copy (AFM) (fig. 11). 16 representat ions </page> <page sequence="17"> figure 11.

The transmission electron micrograph of DNA gears and the atomic  force microscopy image of the nanobox, along with the STM of benzene, are  bare-bones relatives to other nanomicroscopy images, yet they still, in the  words of chemist David Goodsell, “give the feeling that one could simply  reach out and touch the atoms.”60 This awe in “seeing” atomic-scale objects  has not faded, even though available technologies have made such images  quite scientifically commonplace. Indeed, based on their sheer number, one  could surmise that nanomicroscopy images, rather than nanoscale objects  themselves, have become the quintessence of nanotechnology. Through this  technology, nanoaesthetics has been fully transformed into a machine aes- thetics, but one of a different sort than I discussed earlier—an aesthetics  based not on the representations of a machine or its components, but on  images that exist only as the result of a machine. In retrospect, the culmina- tion of nano and its aesthetics into nanomicroscopy makes sense. Chemists  study molecules; physicists study quantum phenomena; and chemical engi- neers manipulate molecules into novel materials; yet, although all of these  scientists work with nanoscale objects, the concept of the nanoscale itself does  not derive from a holistic, productive, epistemological framework for defin- ing an independent field of study. As Schummer writes, “The length[] scale  of objects has never been the main criterion to define a research field; . . . the  nanometer scale is anything else but new; a shared scale of object is hardly  sufficient to integrate different disciplinary perspectives.”61 I contend that  this is why the practice of nanomicroscopy has substituted for ontological def- initions of nanoscience as the field has progressed; nanoscience is now con- gruent with nanomicroscopy. Despite their current ubiquity in the scientific literature, nano-microscopic  images as legitimate scientific evidence has not gone uncontested. What makes  their acceptance as evidence conditional relates intimately to how scientists pro- duce the images: TEM, AFM, and STM are each forms of ultra-high-resolution   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> microscopy, but each generates images in a somewhat different way. As its name  implies, the transmission electron microscope works by passing an electron  beam through a thinly sliced sample, and the transmitted light that passes  through the sample (that is, is not absorbed or scattered) gives “rise to a ‘shadow  image’ of the specimen with its different parts displayed in varied darkness  according to their density.”62 It can resolve objects on the tens of nanometer  scale and, although traditionally used by biologists to image cells and viruses, is  now used to image other types of nanoscale objects at that scale (for example,  the bundled DNA cogs discussed earlier). Like those in figure 10, the images  produced using TEM are typically gray, grainy, and presented from above. Scan- ning tunneling microscopy and AFM differ from TEM but are only subtly dif- ferent from each other. Both employ a metallic probe with a tip the width of  an atom (less then a nanometer) to map the atomic surface of a sample. In  STM the probe, held at a very small distance (a portion of a nanometer)  from the surface, slowly maps the variations in the (tunneling) current  between it and the surface; while in atomic force microscopy the probe, a  flexible cantilever, actually touches the sample surface, bending the cantile- ver up and down, monitoring its electrostatic attraction and repulsion to the  surface. Both of these types of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) appear to  resolve objects on the nanometer scale (that is, atoms and single molecules)  and relative to TEM, STM, and AFM images are usually significantly manipu- lated.63 In part, this is by necessity. Like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),  which translates the signal given off by the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms in  our bodies into images that look like our body parts, enabling doctors to  readily interpret the information, the numeric signal data provided by the  STM or AFM probe as it moves along the surface being mapped is unread- able to most people, including scientists, until translated into a visual con- tour map of the surface. To enhance their readability, scientists often  manipulate SPM images: they exaggerate the relative height scales of the  map to make the troughs deeper and the peaks higher, brightly colorize  them in contrasting colors, and display them from a side-on perspective.  Such manipulations make the contours of the atomic surface more evident  and the images more aesthetically exhilarating than traditional overhead- view, black and white microscope images. The content of such images can be  understood with very little further explanation; typically a short figure cap- tion is enough to convey the scientific essence of the image. In comparison,  nanomicroscopy images that are less drastically manipulated prove more dif- ficult to read outside of the context of a scientific paper. The AFM images of  the nanoscale DNA box, astounding as they appear from a scientific  perspective, are minimally manipulated; the barely distinct colors and  blurred edges have little inherent visual impact. Yet, scientists more generally  accept this relatively indistinct image, and the gray-scale images associated  18 representat ions </page> <page sequence="19"> figure 12. Quantum corral.

One of the most familiar and controversial images from the world of STM  is Donald Eigler’s quantum corral, a representation of the surface electrons  of copper confined within a circular fence of forty-eight iron atoms. Blue iron  atoms surround red electron waves in close-up (fig. 12).64 This repeatedly  replicated image provides an extreme example of the manipulations that  SPM images undergo in scientists’ hands. Article titles such as “Fact and Fan- tasy in Nanotech Imagery,” “Truth and Beauty at the Nanoscale,” and “When  Is an Image not an Image?” disclose the significant unease about the validity  and ethics such highly mediated SPM images represent in the cultural and  philosophical literature.65 Scholars warn us “that the process of making   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 19 </page> <page sequence="20"> pictures with scanning probe microscopy can lead to excessive manipulation  of variables such as color, and that excessive manipulation is tantamount to  misrepresentation.”66 These concerns are nothing new: since the advent of  photography there have been concerns about the truth and objectivity of the  machine-made image. In science studies, Michael Lynch and John Law’s  paper on bird-watching gets to the heart of this representational conundrum  when they write, “As anyone who has attempted photography is aware, pho- tography does not simply capture what the eye sees: the chemistry of emul- sion film differs from that of the eye; still photography documents a frozen  moment, and often the ‘wrong’ moment; light and color come out differ- ently, and often unexpectedly.” They continue, “Depending on the case,  these differences can be turned to advantage or disadvantage.” 67 Artist Ger- hard Richter articulates the dilemma of photographic representation particu- larly well. His photo-based paintings literally blur the line between the  representational and the abstract, and by so doing call into question the idea  of photographic objectivity. As paintings based on photographs, they express  the “problematic reality of photographs,” and by blurring them Richter draws  attention to their inherent distortion “and to the discrepancy between what  one sees firsthand and what happens to that image when it is re-created picto- rially.”68 In the context of chemistry, Richter’s Strontium beautifully exempli- fies this discrepancy: an ironically enormous, approximately 30 3 30 foot  piece made up of 130 digital prints of the TEM of strontium titanate mounted  on aluminum with a Plexiglas coating.69 Strontium, outside of its references to  SPM technologies or elemental strontium 90, stands alone as a massive, mes- merizing piece of abstract art.70 Undaunted by the size of the atrium in which  it hangs, its repetitive, regular line-pattern of 884 gray-white spheres, inter- spersed with strings of 68 smaller gray-white balls, on a black background,  pulses with visual energy.71 This piece fits well within Richter’s artistic preoc- cupations; its very essence melds the formal and conceptual aspects of artistic  and scientific abstraction; distorted, reiterative, and culturally indefinite— what is representation? Seeable? Unseeable?  Despite the representational ambiguities of photography brought to the  fore by Strontium, the manipulation of photographs to highlight evidence has  been a commonly accepted scientific practice since the early twentieth century  when the interpretive judgment of scientific images replaced the nineteenth- century scientific ideal of a self-abnegating mechanical objectivity. Peter Galison  shows that at that time the photographic mechanical image produced by scientists  that was ostensibly “transparent to nature, a copying mechanism with the affec- tive disengagement of the technical manufacturer,” was displaced by interpretive  images fashioned by “self-confident experts who trust the trained eye more than  . . . the automatic conveyance of pictures.”72 With this shift, the manipulation of  images became acceptable: “Interpolation, highlighting, abstraction—all were  20 representat ions </page> <page sequence="21"> subtle interventions needed to elicit meaning from the object or process and to  convey the meaning in the representation itself.”73  If we accept Galison’s historical analysis, why do the images generated by  SPM specifically elicit concerns about truth-value and overmanipulation rel- ative to other scientific images? Is it because nanomicroscopy technologies  are comparatively new, and therefore chemists are unaccustomed to the way  in which they visualize their evidence, or because they are somehow inher- ently more untruthful than other scientific images? How are they different  from the accepted, indeed lauded, cloud chamber images of subatomic par- ticle tracks and the crystal structure of DNA? In all three cases (cloud cham- ber images, DNA’s crystal structure, and SPM images) “graphic recordings  of non-sensory phenomena” produce what Galison terms “golden event”  images: in the first, the trained eye correlates the photographs of the tracks  produced in the ionizing environment of a cloud chamber with particular  subatomic particles; in the second, the trained eye interpolates the photo- graphed diffraction pattern produced when X-rays bombard crystalline DNA  into a three-dimensional image of the heavy atoms; and in the third, the  trained eye computationally transforms the change in current flow between  the tip of a probe moving over a carefully constructed molecular surface  into a contour map of its electron density.74 Beyond the obvious distinctions  between the representations generated by these three techniques, the con- cepts communicated by them also differ. Despite their ability to make sub- atomic particles real, scientists do not interpret photographed cloud chamber  tracks as images of the particles themselves; neither do they understand  DNA’s photographed diffraction pattern and its resultant crystal structure as  genuine images of atoms and molecules.75 By contrast, SPM images, tacitly  misunderstood as actual images of atoms and molecules, have nothing in  reality to do with photography, directly or indirectly.  Among the numerous studies that focus on the specific ways that contem- porary scientists manipulate similar sorts of “photographic” images to  highlight evidence, Kelly Joyce’s work on MRI is most apropos for the under- standing of SPM images. As does MRI, SPM yields numeric information that  is “transformed via computer software” into images disguised as photographs,  and the rhetorical practices associated with MRI pictures also readily apply to  SPM images.76 The first of the rhetorical strategies enumerated by Joyce posi- tions “the image as interchangeable with the real thing depicted instead of a  construction of it” by black-boxing the work of the computer and technician/ doctor. The seemingly straightforward figure caption for the image of the  quantum corral (fig. 12) exemplifies this in reference to SPM technologies:  “Scanning Tunneling Microscope image of individual iron atoms arranged  intentionally on a copper surface in a circular ring, exposing quantum  electron waves.”77 Such descriptions suppress any references to the computer   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 21 </page> <page sequence="22"> translation of the data into the image and its subsequent human-mediated  enhancement. The power of the idea that this, and other early STM images,  purportedly provided “a direct image” of “vital molecular structure[s]” was so  potent that figure captions and descriptions for SPM images that employ the  tropes of suppressive language have continually reverberated and increased  in the scientific and popular literature as SPM technologies have progressed.78  What were once overtly described as maxima and minima related to the  position of atoms have become “reproductions of atoms themselves”; the  peaks and valleys of STM-generated topologies have become, by convention,  atom and not-atom respectively.79 The tradition of using the passive voice in  the scientific literature to provide a stance of objectivity (a convention diffi- cult to avoid), as in the description of “the interaction of single C60 mole- cules with the (1 3 2)-Pt(110) surface has been studied by scanning tunneling  microscopy” that accompanies an STM image of a C60 cluster, reinforces the  idea that SPM provides access to, and “neutral knowledge” of, atoms and  molecules untainted by “human values and social constructs.”80  Joyce’s second rhetorical tactic situates MRI in relation to other types of  medical evidence as “superior to other ways of knowing the body,” as more  “true” and “accurate.”81 In the rhetoric of medical practice the accuracy of the  diagnosis by MRI images far surpasses that of a physical exam; in nanochemistry  the truth-value of SPM images surpasses that of analytical and spectroscopic  data. A recent Chemical and Engineering News concentrate titled “Molecular  Machines Spotted on the Move” reports the “direct observation of the move- ment using scanning tunneling microscopy” of one of Stoddart’s molecular  switches, which until now has only been inferred from “spectroscopic data.” 82  The ability of the rhetoric of SPM to enliven its associated images and elevate  their ontological status is revealed when we look at the actual published STM  images of the bistable rotaxane molecules (fig. 13). As shown, the “direct obser- vation” of the molecules is visually oblique, differentiated from the background  only as vaguely shaped “dumbbell” protrusions on a reddish-black Au(111) sur- face and the supposed “spotting” of the their movement, which implies that  they are caught somehow in the act of moving, is an observation only deduced  by side-by-side images that show that the molecule has moved.83 Yet even for  this, as for all SPM images, the perception that the image is unmediated privi- leges it as scientific evidence over valence structures and computational and  physical molecular models, none of which image actual molecules. As these rhetorical strategies indicate, although SPM images are not  “real” images of atoms and molecules, their evidentiary status derives from  their photographic likeness; in parallel, their aesthetic power derives from  their conflation with photography. Despite the fact that photographs “cap- ture” images by the interaction of the light with the chemicals on film, or  electronically by the translation of light into digital data, and SPM “creates”  22 representat ions </page> <page sequence="23"> figure 13. Tae Ye et al. STM of a bistable rotaxane molecule.

The scanning tunneling microscopist determines what to scan and  how to digitally enhance the SPM image. Within scientific papers the figure  captions contextualize the image, and the viewer brings his or her own scien- tific knowledge to bear on its interpretation. In addition to creating a narra- tive of neutrality and authority, figure captions are intrinsic to the aesthetics  of SPM images in the scientific literature. John Berger writes, In the relation between photograph and words, the photograph begs for an inter- pretation, and the words usually supply it. The photograph, irrefutable as evidence  but weak in meaning, is given a meaning by the words. And words, which by them- selves remain at the level of generalization, are given specific authenticity by the  irrefutability of the photograph. Together the two then become very powerful; an  open question appears to have been fully answered.84 Without its title and explanatory plaque the visual ambiguities of Richter’s Stron- tium remain unresolved—its social and scientific implications minimized and its  aesthetics reduced to the formalism of abstraction. Likewise, without the figure  caption the sense of sublime astonishment inspired by looking at the SPM of a  nanoscale DNA box opening and closing, or a molecular machine moving, is   Nanoaesthetics: From the Molecular to the Machine 23 </page> <page sequence="24"> figure 14.

The multiple image frames that have become conventional for rep- resenting scanning probe micrographs in the scientific literature extends the  aesthetics expressed by the juxtaposition of figure caption with figure (fig. 14).  These conventions, as illustrated by figures 13 and 14, include using multiple  colorized SPM images at various scales; the highlighting of different aspects of  the scanning domain displayed alongside valence structures and, when appro- priate, technomorphs; and the overlay of arrows, axes, and other orienting  pointers on the micrographs themselves, extending those previously discussed  for molecular machines. As discussed earlier in the context of molecular  machines, here the juxtaposition of the visually ambiguous micrograph with  familiar valence structures and pointers resolves the micrograph’s “interpreta- tive ambiguity.” Despite the dryness of figure 13’s caption, “Structure and motion  of a bistable rotaxane molecule, absorbed on Au{111} investigated using electro- chemical scanning electron microscopy,” the diffuseness of the image (yellowish  illuminated blobs on a red-black background) and the mundanity of its valence  structures together form a coherent whole.85 Aesthetically, the figure captions  24 representat ions </page> <page sequence="25"> map the domain of experimental data onto the domain of SPM images and the  valence structures symbolically link the images to chemistry; they synthesize the  noumenal realm of atoms with the figurative world of images. The SPM images discussed in this paper implicitly provide unique access  to the atomic world, allowing us experimentally to examine single and very  small collections of molecules in condensed (liquid and solid) phase states.86  Using SPM technologies, we can monitor the solid-state “interaction of  single C60 (buckminsterfullerene) molecules” with a platinum surface,  “observe” the “single-molecule station changes within bistable rotaxane  molecules” (that is, molecular machines), and move single xenon atoms  around on a nickel surface to spell out IBM.87 Scanning probe microscopy’s  single-molecule representations communicate a particular aesthetic reso- nance for chemists because they establish direct “visual affinities” between  what we see and what we have always envisioned. The 2001 STM of C60  shown in figure 14 “reveal[s] an identical internal fine structure that closely  matches the well-known cage structure” of buckyball that we have been  looking at since its “discovery” in 1985; the 1996 STM image of benzene  reveals Kekulé’s six-membered ring.88 Since the late nineteenth century  chemists have visually communicated their ideas and results using valence  structures of single molecular forms and the coherence between these ide- alized drawings of single molecules and SPM images compel us. As we  expected, buckyballs look like buckyballs and benzene like benzene, an  ouroboros of representational continuity; we are “at home amongst appear- ances.”89  Notes  1. Malcolm W.
