<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVILS AND EVIL LOUIS ARNAUD REID The first thing to do in discussing evil is to admit its ex- istence. Whatever our conclusions there remains a fact, the fact that experience is clouded by evils of various sorts. It is a fact which no amount of cheerful optimism, backed by the- ory or otherwise, can abolish. There it is and there it remains, not in the sphere of human life only, but in "nature, red in tooth and claw." The second thing to do in considering the problem is to ask whether the usual conclusion from the fact, i.e., that evils mean evil, that evil is an ultimate flaw in the face of things, is justified. Is this "best of all possible worlds" less good than it might have been had all evils never been? Has the finite creature, beset by evils, just cause for a grievance against a Maker who set out to fashion more than he could cope with, and who seems to sacrifice the individual in the course of his futile cosmic experimentations? If, for example, cosmic na- ture is, as Huxley said,' "no school of virtue, but the head- quarters of the enemy of ethical nature," may it not be man's function to set himself against cosmic nature and to fight it? Or, on, the other hand, is it possible to contend that the facts of suffering and evil do not in themselves give us any suffi- cient reason for believing there to be some irradicable mis- take, or contradiction, or irrational incoherence in the plan of reality? Evils may be real; it may be impossible for us under any conditions of which we can conceive at present to rid our- selves of them in practice. Yet they may form no absolute bar to a harmonious account of existence. At least this is possible. Before discussing the problems of evil and suffering in their broader aspects, it is worth considering for a moment or 'Evolution and Ethics (Macmillan, i898), p. 75. i8</page><page sequence="2">EVILS AND EVIL I9 two certain different assumptions as to what constitutes evil, or as to what is its source. The first point of view is that which identifies the problem of suffering with the problem of evil, and assumes that suffering is the evil par excellence which man has to combat. This is a view naturally adopted by those (e.g., doctors) whose daily life brings them into contact with suffering. Another point of view, represented perhaps best by those of theological or of social interests, is that which tends to identify evil with sin or vice. The third point of view, which might be described as that of the man of scientific tend- ency, is that in which it is held that the source of evil lies in ignorance. There is a fourth point of view, adopted sometimes by those of metaphysical interests, who, faced with the facts of suffering and evil in all their aspects, are completely baffled by the problem, and put evil down, on the one hand, to the presence of some positive malignant force combating good (the dualistic position), or assume it, on the other hand, to be due in some way to the incompetence or inability, or even the indifference or callousness, of God. I have called this atti- tude that of the metaphysician, because the metaphysician is puzzled by the problem in its most universal aspects. The metaphysician is hard put to it to account for the existence of evil in a harmonious world. The foregoing classification is not exclusive or complete. It is only intended as a rough demarcation of the various atti- tudes which may be taken. The latter three of them will be dealt with by implication. Let us now turn to the first. It is the assumption that the problem of evil is identical with the problem of pain or suffering.2 This assumption is often unconscious rather than otherwise, and no doubt those who make it would quite willingly admit, if challenged, that there are other evils than pain. But as pain and suffering are most formidable objects in practical life, it is not unnatural that this somewhat unthinking assumption should be made. 'The terms, which may mean slightly different things, are here taken as having identical reference.</page><page sequence="3">20 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS In discussing the question of the relation of pain (or suf- fering) to evil, it is important to be clear on the question which has already been raised by implication, i.e., as to whether we mean by evil something which is evil or bad for human beings at certain stages of their existence, and which they have to face and overcome if possible, or an ultimate flaw in the structure of things. It is only if pain is regarded in the latter way that it forms the subject of a profound meta- physical problem. If we adopt the former usage, the problem of pain becomes a practical one, though of course it has meta- physical implications. (For if man, who is an important part of reality, is maimed or destroyed by evil, this might mean the existence of a flaw in the structure of reality. But the broad distinction is clear.) It is through the confusion of the practical with the metaphysical and theoretic issues, i.e., the supposition that because pain is bad for me, it is universally bad, that the mistake of the first attitude mentioned (i.e., the identification of pain with evil) arises. To identify pain with evil, and to speak of evil in this sense as a kind of insoluble problem of the universe, is to adopt a narrow view, and to suppose falsely that because man has practical difficulties which he cannot always overcome, these practical difficulties form real flaws on the face of existence. On the other hand, as we said, if and In so far as the fact of suffering should make it in any way truly impossible for man to realize his highest destiny, then the existence of pain would form a metaphysical puzzle which is unsolved, at least for us. With one provision: that is, so far as this pain is caused by factors utterly and in every way beyond the control of man. For pain may be caused either (a) by the ignorance or the weakness or the immorality of human agents, or (b) by agencies over which human agents have no control whatso- ever. Or at least so it seems. In the former case (a) we are faced with the metaphysical and theological, as well as the</page><page sequence="4">EVILS AND EVIL 2I ethical, implications of the fact of human freedom. Pain, re- garded as caused by human agency, is a peripheral problem leading to the central problem of good and bad, right and wrong. In the latter case (b) we are concerned with factors which it is not always easy to exemplify. It is hard to say, in' many cases where suffering seems unavoidable, whether it is really so. Even being "carried away by a whirlwind"8 might be avoidable with greater knowledge. Much of the suffering which comes in the ordinary course of "nature" is avoidable. It is trite to remark that, generally speaking, this "nat- ural" pain is, biologically, not evil, but good, in its effects. It warns the individual of greater dangers to come, and it rids the race of its less biologically worthy members. To know this is of course no great comfort to the human being who. has to bear pain, but it at least indicates that there is no inherent contra- diction in the existence of pain. If we keep the practical and theoretical aspects distinct, we realize that though in practice we do and must shrink from pain, and though pain is in this sense an evil, the existence of this type of pain as such constitutes no insuperable difficulty, either for science or for meItaphysics. If pain in itself were an ultimate moral evil inherent in reality, it would inevitably, where present, make morality itself impossible. But although in fact too great suffering and hardship does in certain cases deteriorate moral fiber, it does not do so necessarily and inevitably, and it is a familiar fact of history and biography that even out of pain and suffering men have laid the foundation of their souls. To say this does not mean that pain is in itself a good; but it may be a means to good. Pain is truly'in its nature (although we shrink from it and therefore name it evil) non-moral; yet out of his experi- ence of it man may fashion that character which, said Her- acleitus, is his fate. As against those who believe that suffer- istotle Nick. Ethics iii. i.</page><page sequence="5">22 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS ing is a wholly insuperable barrier to goodness, it is needful to get some such words as those of Maeterlinck:4 Let us always remember that nothing befalls us that is not of the na- ture of ourselves. There comes no adventure but wears to our soul the shape of our every day thoughts ..... Real fatality exists only in cer- tain external disasters-as disease, accident, the sudden death of those we love; but inner fatality there is none. Yet there is a kind of suffering which throws on human life a darker shadow, perhaps, even than physical pain. It is the mental suffering and darkness which may come with age and disease. If there is inner fatality anywhere it is here. Disease and age may so affect mental and moral powers as apparently to undermine character and even lead to complete moral de- generation. To say that here responsibility ceases and the man becomes subhuman is scarcely quite satisfactory, though it may be true in some cases. Perhaps the saddest cases of all are those who suffer from the darkness and loneliness of age or sickness, and who yet have not the compensation of forget- fulness nor sufficient physical or mental energy to be coura- geous. It is in this sphere of suffering, if in any, that there seems to be an unaccountable residuum of evil. Yet even in these cases it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate that moral stamina is really defeated by the powers of darkness, or if it is so, whether the conditions which produce such sufferings are wholly unavoidable. We shall return to a discussion of the lat- ter point below. Let us turn for the moment to a consideration of certain other aspects of the problem of evil. For there are difficulties other than that of the fact of pain produced by physical causes. Two things among others the existence of evil is sup- posed to deny. One is the satisfaction of the reasonable desire for happiness in this life, both in itself and as the reward of virtue. The other is the satisfaction of the reasonable desire 'Wisdom and Destiny (Sutro's translation), pp. 37-38.</page><page sequence="6">EVILS AND EVIL 23 to continue in a future life the work of discovery (with its accompanying happiness) which is only begun in this life. Let us take the latter point first. It is sometimes argued that unless we believe in immortality we must think of one generation as a mere means to the next, of the individual as a mere means to racial purposes. But although it is true that the discovery and experience of a single life is always an un- finished one, and that future generations reap the benefit of what earlier generations have done, this does not imply that the life of one generation is simply a means. It may be means, but it is not merely so: it has instrumental value, but it also has intrinsic worth of its own. In regarding one generation as a mere means to the next we are ignoring the value and joy which is experienced in the life of discovery itself, the moral fiber which is created, the triumph of achievement which is worth while in itself, which would make life, so far, good, even if nothing else were to follow. That the value of life in its various activities may not be enjoyed forever does not detract from the enjoyment of value so far as it exists, except in so far as the idea that joy will have an end is allowed to affect present experience. In all vigorous-minded persons who have been infused with the joys of life it is true that the idea of its incompleteness must sometimes appear as a dark cloud upon the horizon of the mind. But though these thoughts will arise sometimes, they do not, except in the morbid and overspecu- lative, detract from the vigor and determination and grit with which the tasks of life are pursued. To admit all this is not, of course, to touch upon the theo- retic problem. It remains a fact that one of the strongest arguments that immortality should be (I do not say, neces- sarily, is) is that it appears a wastage that life should be cut off just at the time when a man is beginning to learn his lesson and reap the benefit of experience. That for too many men age means an undue crystallization, lack of progressiveness, and so deterioration of usefulness in a changing world, is no</page><page sequence="7">24 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS final argument that death should end all things for all men. The best men we know are those to whom life and living be- come sweeter and richer and mellower even as the years go by. The argument again would have no bearing on the mys- tery of those cut off in youth or in the prime of life. On the other hand, when all is said and done, we have no sufficient evidence for concluding with certainty that life does end with the grave. As regards the other question, that of distribution of hap- piness in this life, and particularly the apparent independence of virtue and happiness, vice and misery, it would again seem as if there were no sufficient grounds for ultimate pessimism. In fact, the very way of stating the problem and speaking of the distribution of happiness as if it were a kind of thing apart from goodness is highly artificial. It is perfectly true that vir- tue, in this world, is not always followed by reward, that the just man is troubled, and so forth and so on. But speaking broadly, happiness is a sign of perfection of functioning, and unhappiness a sign of imperfection. Where there is pain or misery or unhappiness it is found, in cases where we have knowledge of the circumstances, that there is maladjustment of some sort. This maladjustment is not necessarily the fault of the individual who suffers, and if it be an ultimate evil or flaw in things (which is doubtful) that the innocent should suffer for the guilty, then evil exists. It is the business of man- kind, community and individual, to adapt itself to natural and moral laws, and if one individual suffers misery on account of the maladaptation of his parents or of the wider society in which he lives, then it is his parents or society which is to blame, and not the designer of the universe. It, is petulant and childish to blame the Deity for all the troubles that man is heir to on account of his own inability to adapt himself to his environment. (God in the end may be responsible for the measure of freedom in the creature, but that opens a wider question. It is undisputed that the creature can and does</page><page sequence="8">EVILS AND EVIL 25 learn when it really wants to.) It is not as though life were something given ready-made to man by God, containing two values, virtue and happiness, both of which were necessary for full satisfaction, and that God in some cases, deliberately and out of his own free will, withheld happiness. This is an artificial, anthropomorphic, and pagan way of regarding the nature of the relation of virtue and happiness. The relation of successful functioning to happiness, in morals as in every other sphere, is organic, and it is mankind's task to discover, through hard experience, that if humanity fails to fit itself in with the purposes of God (whose purposes include the proc- esses of nature), humanity, individual, and community, must suffer until it learns better. All this does not conflict with rec- ognition that the suffering of the individual is a real suffering, and it is perhaps harder to understand in the case of the vir- tuous man than in the case of the vicious one. It seems just that the vicious man should experience sorrow and misery. As the world is, the reverse is often the case. The supreme Man of Christendom was the, Man of Sorrows. On the other hand, as Jesus said, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of," and it is a mistaken view to regard the unhappiness of the virtuous man altogether in an external way. He himself may have rather a different story to tell. His conflict with the world brings pain, but he has an inner joy which it is impos- sible to describe, "a peace which passeth all understanding." The evil which exists alongside of it does not negate the exist- ence of this value. The general view on behalf of which I am arguing is that there is no evidence for assuming that evil (whatever form it is supposed to take) is an absolute principle of existence, as positive value is, or that God is the direct cause of finite evils, and wills them, although God may be said knowingly to have "taken his chances" that finite evils should exist, and in that sense to be ultimately responsible. In arguing this I am not putting forward a facile optimism. I am not ignoring the con-</page><page sequence="9">26 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS flict between the order of nature and the order of value, the existence not only of pain and deformity and disease of body, but of pain, deformity, disease, darkness, desolation of mind. All these are facts, as I began by urging, and at least half the business of life is to combat them. They are facts which hu- manity has to try to understand so as to gain mastery over them, and, when it cannot understand them, to suffer as best it may. But the existence of evils of these and the ten thou- sand other sorts which might be mentioned is no evidence that there is a principle of evil in the world; positive, like the prin- ciple of good. Evil appears to be, not a positive force, but something which arises in the conflict of finite beings with the world. Evil arises through the antithesis of matter and mind, of inertia and force, and out of the failure of life to adapt it- self to environment. (Where there is simply difficulty, and not final defeat or failure, we should scarcely apply the term "evil." Thus in heaven or in a utopia it is conceivable that there might be real conflict without evil, though on the other hand it is hard to conceive of real conflict without the possi- bility of real defeat.) Finite evil arises, not out of any prin- ciple of its own, so to speak, but in the working out of the pur- pose of the world, which seems to be that creatures should perfect themselves through conflict, trial, and error. So far as we can judge it seems to be a good purpose. It is true that nature sometimes-appears to be on the side against the reali- zation of values-although at other times she seems on the side of value, e.g., the joy of young life in springtime. But nature is not the whole of reality; she is only one of the mani- festations of it, and if nature seems sometimes to thwart hu- man values just as they seem to be perfecting themselves, it does not follow that reality, with its wider purposes, has not in view a higher realization of value. On the contrary, it would seem that the purpose, as far as we can see it, which domi- nates universal life seems to be on the side of good. Taking it all in all, struggle does not eliminate the fit, but the unfit</page><page sequence="10">EVILS AND EVIL 27 Mistakes do not, on the whole, lead to worse mistakes, but to the correction of them. Failure ends usually, not in failure, but in new beginnings. The facts of pain or of natural disaster stir the human mind to fierce activity, which culminates in time in a mastery over natural events which is for the ultimate raising of the level of humanity and the fuller realization of the values which life has to offer. If in a sense God is the cause of all things, in that sense he is the cause of the evil, as well as the good, and it is his will that all creation should learn to per- fect itself and to master its environment through action and knowledge by the way of battle and pain. But the will of God is not (at least the experience of people seems to show) finally for these things in themselves, but for the betterment of the quality, the character, the fiber, that is developed in the strug- gle and which it is inconceivable could be developed other- wise. This latter point is frequently ignored; it is 'assumed that the world would have been better without evil, that the exist- ence of evil is a sign of the inefficiency of God. But is it so? Can we conceive of the history of a world in which moral quality should have been developed, and which at the same time should contain nothing of what we call evil? Surely to try to conceive of a world in the development of which there should be no defeat, hardship, difficulty, pain, destruction, is to think one's self out of reality altogether, and in the process to find one's self dreaming a bad dream. A world which had always been perfect in every part would be, if it truly were conceivable at all, horrible to conceive; certainly far more horrible than the world as it is. In a word, it may be said to those who grumble that the Maker of things has failed in his handiwork: "Show us a better thing." As far as finite minds can judge, this world is certainly the best conceivable, in the plain sense that it is impossible for any finite mind to conceive a better, on the whole. Proposals of improvement on the</page><page sequence="11">28 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS scheme of things would certainly turn out to be immeasurably worse than the original. The foregoing arguments do not, of course, imply that the world is not capable of improvement in detail. It is obvious that the world would be in actuality better if many of the particular evils we know were removed; that it is the task of mankind to remove them as far as possible. The argument then is not that the world is wholly and absolutely perfect in every part; not that evil, as a feature of things, does not exist as an experienced fact; but that evil, though necessary in the process of world-making and develop- ment, is not the final purpose or end of things. The final pur- pose or end of things is good, or has positive value. Good or positive value is on the side of effort toward development. The contention is, not that evil is unreal, nor that all evils, coming together, cancel out in the Absolute. It is not that evil is in the end the good, but the very different one: that evil is necessary for good in the end. To put it theologically, the will of God may be held to be perfect, but it does not follow from this that every part of reality is perfect, even in the light of the whole, nor does it follow that if a perfect will wills some- thing which is imperfect, i.e., that if a good God countenances evil, the perfect will is imperfect. To put the matter in a more orthodox form (for there are no original arguments on these matters), the limitation of God's will by the evil which is the corollary of finite development is his self-limitation, willed by a perfect will which sees that the best of all possible worlds is not a ready-made perfect world, but a perfecting world, where creatures with freedom pursue their chief end, which is the progressive glorification and enjoyment of God. That the God, whose will is still perfect, nevertheless shares the imper- fection of his creatures, seems to me a matter for little doubt. I cited four types of mind representative of four different ways of viewing the problem of evil: (i) The practical man inclines to regard evil as identical with pain or suffering; (2)</page><page sequence="12">EVILS AND EVIL 29 the scientific man, with ignorance; (3) the theologian or the moralist, with sin or vice, while (4) some minds with meta- physical interests, accepting the fact of evil of various sorts, regard evil as a flaw or contradiction in the nature of ulti- mate reality. The general explanation of evil which has been adopted here, namely, that evil arises through maladaptation of the individual and the race to its environment, is suffi- ciently broad to include and account for all these views except the last for which it is a substitute. (i) The evil of physical pain and of the mental pain resulting from physical causes is due to the maladaptation of the physical organism to physical conditions. In the animal world adaptation is learned by the elimination of the unfit and by the development of instinct and intelligence. At the human level the same factors play their part, only that intelligence is very highly developed and tends to supplement, and even to stand as substitute for, the other two, so much so that it may be said that human suffer- ings are more due to avoidable (2) ignorance than to any other cause. The scientist is right in his claim for knowledge. Science has sufficiently developed to indicate the enormous differences which knowledge may make in the solution of medical, surgical, social, and other problems. So rapid has been the progress recently that there is almost nothing of which it can be confidently said, "no amount of human knowl- edge could ever prevent this disaster to human life." This applies not only to physical and mental diseases, not only to accidents such as those at birth which may cause deformity or imbecility, but even to those great external disasters such as flood, earthquake, and fire, still referred to in insurance poli- cies as being caused "by the act of God." Ignorance is mal- adaptation; knowledge is power over evil. So again (3) is sin and vice maladaptation, not merely to natural laws, but to the deeper demands and purposes of our nature called moral laws. Here again, if man sins he will suffer, and not he only, but his children and his children's children. In these ways, then-not</page><page sequence="13">30 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS exclusive, but supplementing one another-does man fail to adapt himself as a physical animal, as an intelligent being, and as knowing good and evil. These in themselves are suffi- cient to account for a very large part of the evils of life, with- out having any recourse to theories of dualism, of divine in- competence, and so on. The rest lie in spheres of which we have as yet no adequate knowledge. But ignorance is never ground for a positive .thesis. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF WALES ABERYSTWYTH</page></plain_text>
