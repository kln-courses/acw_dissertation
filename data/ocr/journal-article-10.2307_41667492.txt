Infantile and Jaguar Traits in Olmec Sculpture By AGUSTÍN DELGADO The Olmec complex is a cultural manifestation which appeared in Middle America about 850 B.c. and lasted until about 200 b.c. Sculpture and pottery in Olmec style have been found as far north as Tampico, Tamaulipas, and to the south well into El Salvador, with more frequent finds in the Valley of Mexico, on the coast of Guerrero and along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, where the site of La Venta, Tabasco, was the principal center of the civilization (see map) . Within this culture flourished a unique art style, two characteristics of which are the skilful fusion of jaguar-like and human features and an emphasis on infant portrayal. Both two- and three-dimensional representations reflect a varying balance between these elements. In some cases a feline body may bear a head with mixed feline and human features, while in others a distinctly human body, either adult or infantile, is combined with a human head in which tigrine elements may be present. Here we shall ex- amine briefly some of the variants which occur in Olmec representations of infants. These include both normal and grotesque, probably pathological, types. All these modeled or sculptured figures show cer- tain common characteristics. They are always repre- 55</page><page sequence="2">1. Chinantec Indian youth from the state of Oaxaca, Mexico.

Feline markings may or may not be present, but the mouth is characteristically portrayed in a pouting expression similar to that still seen among certain indigenous groups in Mexico (Figure 1). Many figures have a depression extending from mid-forehead to the occiput. The face may be oval or pear-shaped, and the eyes occasionally show a pro- nounced epicanthic fold. The gums, visible in open- mouthed figures, are usually toothless. Non-feline infants of normal physical aspect oc- cur in both stone and clay. Whether squatting or standing, stone figurines showing normal physical condition are characterized by a semi-flexed position of the legs. Examples have been found in Guerrero, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Tabasco in Mexico, and from the site of El Baul in Guatemala. The Guerrero example (Figure 2), made of ser- pentine, has its face contorted in a grimace apparently denoting weeping, and the cheeks bear an elongated engraved design of clearly Olmec type. The figure stands with knees flexed. A kneeling figure from Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz (Figure 3), crudely carved in basalt, appears to be holding a small tubular object to its mouth. A similar piece (Figure 4) was purchased by the writer in Union Hidalgo, Oaxaca, on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It shows a kneeling child gazing upward, with arms flexed and chin rest- ing on the wrists, a characteristic attitude. Another figure of this type (Figure 5) was found by Philip Drucker at La Venta, Tabasco. He de- scribes it (Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of Amer- ican Ethnology, Bulletin 153 [1952] 159) as a dancer with head thrown back, arms crossed at the chest, knees bent and an even distribution of weight which permits the figure to stand by itself. The head is elongated, and the chin is smaller and narrower than in the examples already cited. From the same site of La Venta comes a monu- mental example in basalt (Figure 6). Erroneously called La Abuelita (Little Grandmother), it is ac- tually a seated child holding a small box in its hands in the manner of an offering. The figure has a dis- tinctly feline mouth. The most southerly example of an infant looking upward was found by Edwin Shook in Guatemala (Figure 7; see Archaeology 9 [1956] 260). This fragment, including only the head and shoulders, is from the site of El Baul, near Santa Lucia Cotzumal- huapa in the Department of Escuintla, which is known for its ruins featuring monumental art.

Olmec Sculpture continued figure is of jadeite, with typical Olmec engraving on the cheeks and a helmet-like head-covering secured by a band under the chin. The infantile expression features a jaguar-like mouth with toothless gums, a rounded face and a marked epicanthic fold. In Shook' s words: "When the head is held in a level position the posture suggests a seated figure, leaning forward slightly with shoulders hunched. . . . Be- hind the head and between the shoulder blades there is a projection, the nature of which cannot be de- termined." Abnormal or pathological physical traits seem to characterize some Olmec figurines. Miguel Covar- rubias, the Mexican painter who was a pioneer in the study of Olmec art, identified the following ab- normalities: dystrophia adiposa genitalis and other irregularities in growth and distribution of fat caused by unbalanced secretion of the endocrine glands (par- ticularly the pituitary), dwarfism, acromegaly, achon- droplasm and abnormal curvature of the spine. That these figures may in fact represent misshapen children rather than adults with pathological traits is shown by the portrayal of the childlike figure held out in the arms of a seated personage on the front of La Venta Altar 5 (Figure 8) and other child-figures be- ing cared for by attendants, all with jaguar-like mouths, on the sides of the altar (Figure 9) . Apparently pathological cases which occur in other infantile representations are those in which the lower jaw seemingly is lacking and some which, because of their strained "listening" position, appear to repre- sent deaf children. Agnathous individuals are said actually to possess a mandible that is very flat and lacking in dentition, so that persons thus afflicted are reduced to nourishing themselves with fluids (but the impression is inescapable that the flat chins on some of the infantile sculptures are intended to represent a feline trait) . We show three figures which exhibit this presumed pathological condition: one from Iguala, Guerrero, a second from Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz, and a third of unknown provenience, now in the American Museum of Natural History. The Iguala specimen (Figure 10) was found by Miguel Covarrubias, who described it as "a fat-bodied piece, minus the head, in black polished serpentine with an astonishing real- ism and workmanship. . . .

It was pear-shaped, with protruding eyes, fleshy jowls and an extremely strange mouth . . . like that of a child or dwarf born without the lower jaw, showing the trachea sculptured in realistic form" {Cuadernos Americanos V, 4 [1946] 153). The figurine from Cerro de las Mesas (Figure 11), in the storerooms of the National Museum of Archae- ology in Mexico, is made of basalt. The figure is squatting with knees flexed, the head thrown slightly backward, and holds in its hands a rectangular object, as in the case of the Abuelita sculpture from La Venta. There is a ridge of hair along the the top of the head and locks on each side falling to the shoul- der, but the back of the head is clean-shaven. Only two shallow perforations remain to show the eyes, and the open mouth shows a complete upper denti- tion, but the lower jaw and the teeth are completely lacking. The third agnathous example (Figure 12) is a basalt head associated stylistically with the south coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It was originally part of a complete figurine probably broken in antiquity. The scalp is clean-shaven in the Olmec manner, with incised eyes, heavy jowls, rectangular ears and a mouth with a distinctly feline upper lip and flattened lower jaw. The neck is almost nonexistent and merges into what was evidently a fleshy body. Passing to figures of the "deaf" type, we show a magnificent basalt figure representing a child, which Covarrubias found in the state of Veracruz (Figure 13). The left hand is raised to the ear and the mouth is slightly open. The head is clean-shaven. The figure stands with knees slightly flexed, the feet enlarged to afford a better balance. A number of infant figures have accentuated jaguar-like features. Covarrubias says of this classic Olmec style: ". . . Its ideology is . . . impenetra- ble. It represents exclusively gods or mythic beings who appear to be simultaneously jaguars and children or humanized jaguar cubs, with humpbacked dwarfs and other deformed types. The stylistic ideal of the Olmec artist was undoubtedly based upon his own physical type, modified in certain aspects of a patho- logical character and imbued with the feline traits" ( Cuadernos Americanos V, 4 [1946] 178). It is interesting to speculate that the connection between infant and jaguar features may have arisen from the similarity between the pouting mouths of Indian infants and those of jaguars. Moreover, the eminent ethnohistorian Wigberto Jimenez Moreno comments ( Cuadernos Americanos I, 5 [1942] 113- 145) : "The obsession with feline characteristics must have had an essentially religious motivation." This seems a point well taken: both children and adults represented with feline features may thus acquire di- vinity and power from the jaguar, which symbolized force, mystery, the night and, ultimately, death. In Olmec representations of both infants and adults there is a depression or cleft in the forehead. A typi- cal example is shown in Figure 14, a child with a jaguar-like mouth. The forehead depression is carried over into Classic (a.D. 250-850) Teotihuacan clay figurines from the Valley of Mexico, appearing as an undulation which gives the head a heart-shaped or bilobate form. At sites of the Teotihuacan culture, this head shape ap- pears particularly during periods II and III, on thou- sands of small hand-modeled and, later, mold-made clay figurines (Figure 15). In Late Preclassic times appears one of the most interesting figurine types associated with the Olmec culture, the so-called "baby-face" type, hand-modeled 61</page><page sequence="8">Olmec Sculpture continued in clay. The figurines are usually large and hollow and are frequently painted white. This type may be represented standing or seated, with childlike facial features and smiling, but sometimes with feline fea- tures ranging from only slight distortion to an almost perfect copy of a jaguar mouth. Until a few years ago these clay figures were at- tributed only to the Valley of Mexico, the state of Morelos and the Gulf Coast from Veracruz to Ta- basco. Recently they have been found as far south as El Salvador. Figure 16 illustrates a typical Morelos example. Three unusual "baby-face'' figures showing well defined female sexual features were found by Roberto Gallegos in La Venta in 1959, one of which is shown in Figure 17 (left). A "baby-face" figure from the site of Conga, in the province of Coate- peque, El Salvador, is the most unusual example (Figure 17, above). It is large and hollow, and its arms, now lost, were made separately and articulated. It apparently dates to the Late Preclassic period. We have seen that the representation of infants, often with jaguar-like features, played an important part in Olmec art. But what of the significance be- hind these strange, often grotesque, combinations? In Early and Middle Preclassic times the people in Mesoamerica were nomadic hunters (with incipient agriculture) who wandered in the jungle or on the plains and because their weapons were simple lived in fear of the stronger animals. They tended to wor- ship the jaguar because of its power, its mystery and its nocturnal prowess. Probably they yearned to pos- sess such power so as to be able to dominate the jaguar and, indeed, all situations beyond their control. The jaguar cult may be seen to have a long and almost unbroken existence in Mesoamerican history. We have noted its combination in the Preclassic period with infant and adult anthropomorphic fea- tures in Olmec sculpture; during the same period in Atlihuayan, Morelos, adult figures of clay are repre- sented with jaguar costumes and masks. At Teoti- huacan the jaguar is the most common figure in recently discovered murals of the Classic period. Dur- ing the Toi tec period at Chichen Itza there are jaguar thrones, and at Tula, the Toltec capital, the jaguar representation is frequent. Among the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico the caballero tigre order of warriors was highly regarded. Thus the Olmec infantile sculp- tures with occasional jaguar features illustrated here are early representations of a religious theme central to most of the Mesoamerican civilizations.
