Between the mid sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries, at least six separate songs enjoyed circulation in either Scotland or England, until the finalflowering' in the song we know today. This was of such a quality that it has continued to spread, thrive and diversify by re-creation without another act of major re-compositionfor afurther two hundred andfiftyyears. This paper sets out to trace the origins and early evolution of a classic folk song by analysing as far as practicable all available printed and recorded versions. There are a number of reasons why 'John Barleycorn' is a good candidate for such treatment. Its unusual, if not unique, anthropomorphic theme of barley as a person being grossly mistreated by humans, its relation to the seasonal growth of crops, its use in making beer with its humorous and salutary effects on drinkers, and the plant's final revenge, is indeed a powerful and fascinating one. Anthologists have found it difficult to classify the song, having placed it such diverse categories as 'Good Company', 'Rural Life', 'Sport and Diversion', 'Songs of Ceremony', and 'The Joys and Curse of Drink'.I Perhaps this very uniqueness has made it one of our most popular tradi- tional songs, with a large number of different tunes, and featuring equally prominently in the rural oral tradition, the broadside trade, and the current folk revival. As this study shows, the theme has been re-composed several times in the last 450 years to yield a family of seven different songs, the 'Barleycorn family', as well as some more distant relatives. There are two sub-families, one, including 'John Barleycorn' itself, seeing the character mainly as the plant, and the other mainly as beer. The existence of this pedigree has greatly facilitated the present study, revealing perhaps more about origins and evolution of the main song, 'John Barley- corn' than would be the case with most other songs. In addition, the song's history jumps with fascinating frequency between England and Scotland. The Barleycorn Family We need to be clear from the outset which song or songs we are discussing. The 'Barleycorn family' contains seven distinct songs, each, I suggest, generated by a single creative act by an individual. However, five of these appear to have been extinct for nearly two hundred years, since when the 'main song' of the family, which I shall call 'John Barleycorn' (often called 'Sir John Barleycorn') has domi- nated. Here is a representative version of the song published in 1846:2 (CD Copyright English Folk Dance and Song Society and author</page><page sequence="2">JOHN BARLEYCORN: THE EVOLUTION OF A FOLK-SONG FAMILY 439 There came tiree men out of the west, their victory to try And they have taken a solemn oath poor Barleycorn should die They took a plough and ploughed him in and harrowed clods on his head And then they took a solemn oath John Barleycorn was dead There he lay sleeping in the ground till rain from the sky did fall Then Barleycorn sprung up his head and so amazed them all There he remained till midsummer and looked both pale and wan Then Barleycorn he got a beard and so became a man Then they sent men with scythes so sharp to cut him off at knee And then poor little barleycorn they served him barbarously Then they sent men with pitchforks strong to pierce him through the heart And like a dreadful tragedy they bound him to a cart And then they brought him to a barn a prisoner to endure And so they fetched him out again and laid him on the floor And they sent men with holly clubs to beat the flesh from his bones But the miller he served him worse than that for he ground him between two stones Oh Barleycorn is the choicest grain that ever was sown on land It will do more than any grain by the turning of your hand It will make a boy into a man and a man into an ass It will change your gold into silver and your silver into brass It will make a huntsman hunt the fox that never wound his horn It will bring the tinker to the stocks that people may him scorn It will put sack into a glass and claret in the can And it will cause a man to drink till he neither can go nor stand The idea of a 'Barleycorn family' of songs comes from Robert Jamieson's Popular Ballads and Songs published in 1 806. He printed six separate 'pieces' [songs] on a common theme, by which either the barley plant or its alcoholic product was given human form. The six are given their own section, entitled 'Allane-a-maut; and Sir John Barleycorn'. He declares '... none of them destitute of merit, upon a very popular subject'. In considering these songs, the theme has three parts. Part A concerns the growth, harvesting, and processing of the plant, Part B the brewing process, and Part C the effects of beer on people. In the version of 'John Barleycorn' above, there is no Part B, and Part C only has the last two verses. 1. Allan-a-Maut (see Appendix 1) The first member of the family, 'Allan-a- Maut', was created before 1568, and is described by Jamieson as 'good classical Scotish'.4 Although it is difficult to translate its mixture of ancient Scots dialect and Norman French, and there is hardly any textual concordance with the main song, it is clearly the story of 'John Barleycorn', in which the barley plant has been character- ized as 'Alan of the malt'. It devotes half its text to the plant (Part A) and half to beer (Part C), with nothing on the brewing process. Only the fourth verse has elements found in 'John Barleycorn', viz hooks [sickles] and wooden cradle [cart]. But there is an interesting phrase in verses 5 and 6, 'neither go nor stand' which is found in</page><page sequence="3">440 FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL The Pleasant Ballad "Three Knights North" (Harvard) A As I rode through the north country, I heard a pleasant greeting A pleasant toy and full of joy, two noblemen were meeting And as they walk-ed for to sport, upon a summer's day, Then with another nobleman, they went to make affray.

Although this text was reprinted in a couple of ninteenth-century anthologies, it remains the only one we have. 2. Allan o' Maut (see Appendix 2) The second, 'Allan o' Maut', described by Jamieson as 'modern Scotish, and very popular in the north-east of Scotland ... [in the 1780s] ...',5 has a title suggesting that it was a re-composition of 'Allan-a-Maut' to make it more comprehensible to eight- eenth-century Scots. The song has lost a lot of the beer aspect, and in addition to sickles in verse 2, mentions holly flails in verse 5, as featured in many versions of 'John Barleycorn': The hollin souples that were sae snell, His back they loundert, mell for mell; Mell for mell, and baff for baff, Till his hide flew about his lugs like caff. The problem with this song is that it is the only printing I have found, and its prove- nance is 'sent to me by ... of Lincoln'. No date of creation is even suggested. 3. The Pleasant Batlad The first English song in the family was the one which created the character Sir John Barleycorn. It was registered with the Stationers' Company on 14 December 1624 and appeared as a blackletter broad- side by Henry Gosson of London (printed between 1607 and 1641).6 This song carried the uncrisp title of 'A Pleasant new Ballad. To sing evening and morn, of the bloody murder of Sir John Barleycorn'. Jamieson's number five is a collation of the Gosson print with another print from about 1670.7 Both Evans8 and Chappell9 reproduced the original Gosson print. I will distinguish this song from 'John Barleycorn' by calling it 'The Pleasant Ballad'. Figure 1 compares 'The Pleasant Ballad' and 'John Barleycorn' ('Three North' version), indicating how the verses relate to Parts A, B, and C. It is important to note that it introduces for the first time most of the elements found consistently in 'John Barleycorn', namely knights swear- ing an oath, rain followed by sun, the beard, and most vividly the miller grinding him between stones, virtually the only line present in all versions of 'John Barley- corn. 4. John Barleycorn Jamieson's third song was an early version of 'John Barleycorn', which he recalled from hearing it as a boy in Morayshire, and which will be discussed in the following section. 5. Mas' Mautt Whilst the four songs above are all but exclusively about John Barleycorn as barley, the remaining two are entirely about beer and its effects on drinkers (Part</page><page sequence="7">444 FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL -af t4f Sa#I hid * -7 ~ ~ ~ ~ oa i,htylntukpe'd Fid - fa {~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~l ThsI enr caoull lthe orSb:Cout; 4retdi-ln @i,--w -h,- .

Jamieson's number four, 'Mas Mault' ['Master Malt', as in 'that master malt, he 'as me by the legs ...'], does not use the Barleycorn character, but was first printed alongside the original broadside of 'The Pleasant Ballad' and in virtually every subsequent printing,10 and so is included in the family (Figure 2).</page><page sequence="8">JOHN BARLEYCORN: THE EVOLUTION OF A FOLK-SONG FAMILY 445 160 |Pleasant Mas Mault Little Barley-come Ballad Allan o' Maut c.1750 Jamieson Bums FoE Harvard MoH Figure 3 'Timeline' of the ancestors of 'John Barleycorn'. 'JB' is the proposed original of the song. For other explanations, see text. All arrows are speculative 6. The Little Barley-Corne As mentioned earlier, Jamieson dedicated a section of his publication to the five songs just discussed, but learned about the sixth member subsequently. 'The Little Barley- Corne', which although it has the same theme as 'Mas Mault', has tended to appear on its own in broadsides, appears to be a completely different song also describing the effect of beer on drinkers. Whereas 'Mas' Mault' is a somewhat metaphorical and ponderous, this song is much wittier. It was entered into the Stationers' Register in November 1632.11 After Jamieson, the song occurred subse- quently only in Evans12 and Chappell,13 both of whom used seventeenth-century broadsides as their sources. Dick, in his 1903 analysis of Burns's version of 'John Barleycorn'14 (sic), lends support to the idea of a link between these songs by quoting all of the songs in Jamieson, starting with the following: Ballads celebrating the prowess of this redoubtable hero have been known in England and Scotland for more than three centuries. The earliest version is in the Bannatyne MS. 1568 entitled Why should not Allane honorit be, subscribed Allane Matsonis Suddartis, a pseudonym or parody on the titled Allane-a- maut. Figure 3 shows the temporal relation- ships between these six members of the 'Barleycorn family'. It appears that by the early eighteenth century all the early members of the family were either extinct, or much less popular, and that this is about the time that the main song of the family, 'John Barleycorn', first appeared. A third song entirely on the theme of John Barleycorn as beer, some- times called 'John Barleycorn' and some- times 'Hey! John Barleycorn', was composed in the mid nineteenth cen- tury.15 To distinguish it from 'John Barleycorn', I shall call it 'Hey John Barleycorn', and it forms the seventh member of 'the Barleycorn family'.</page><page sequence="9">446 FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL The Original 'John Barleycorn' Figure 3 illustrates my belief that 'Allan-a- Maut', an original creation, inspired the later creation of a new song, 'The Pleasant Ballad' which in turn inspired another new song, 'John Barleycorn'. The first of these two re-compositions has not been explored much, although McColl and Seeger say 'it is possible that the song [The Pleasant Ballad] is a re-make of Allan a Maut - a piece with an identical theme'.16 The second event, however, appears to be accepted by many scholars. Not only did Jamieson publish one of the earliest versions of 'John Barleycorn' ,17 but he was the first to see a connection with 'The Pleasant Ballad', and to suggest how this happened:18 ... and the latter, ['The Pleasant Ballad'] at least, has been popular, as one now and then hears scraps of it among the peasants in different parts of England; but whether it was unskilfully amplified from the third ['John Barleycorn'], or the third happily abridged from it, does not now seem easy to be determined. The present writer is rather inclined to the latter opinion; and it is certainly very much improved in the abridgment; although both the improvement and abridg- ment were probably casual rather than inten- tional, and owing more to default of memory than to superiority of genius. This seems to have happened to most of the old ballads, of which only a few striking features are remembered, which being unskilfully put together, give to the style of these composi- tions that abrupt and elliptical character by which they are distinguished. Whilst most subsequent scholars would agree with Jamieson about which came first,19 his contention that the 'abridge- ment ... was casual rather than intentional' seems less likely. It seems much more likely that an individual was impressed by 'The Pleasant Ballad', and actively sought a way of making it more palatable to what would probably be a mid-eighteenth- century audience. Jamieson's version of 'John Barleycorn' was not the first version in print, this honour being due to either an English broadside (see later), or to Robert Burns's version, which was included in his Commonplace Book of 1785, where the poet states:20 I once heard the old song that goes by this name sung, and being very fond of it, and remembering only two or three verses of it, viz., the first, second, and third, with some scraps that I have interwoven here and there. Another form of words used by Burns was: 21 This is partly composed on the plan of an old song known by the same name. The crucial question for the present study is whether the song Burns had remembered, and was forced by loss of memory into re-working, was 'The Plea- sant Ballad' or 'John Barleycorn'. Many scholars quoting Burns's version appear not to distinguish between the two songs,22 seeing the latter as merely a variant of the former. Kennedy states that 'Robert Burns altered it considerably and added further verses'.23 Baring Gould states that, 'after five verses the ballad ['The Pleasant Ballad'] ... runs the same as ours', when it patently does not, and 'The words as now sung may be found in the Mountain of Hair Garland [sic] ...' when again they do no such thing.24 It is my view that Burns re-worked an existing version of 'John Barleycorn'. Several pieces of evi- dence support this view: (1) Kinsley explores the very slightly different versions of Burns's version in three sources: The Commonplace Book of 1785, the Kilmarnock Manuscript of</page><page sequence="10">JOHN BARLEYCORN: THE EVOLUTION OF A FOLK-SONG FAMILY 447 1786, and the Edinburgh edition of 1787. The subtlety of these changes is in keeping with Baring Gould's comment that Burns 'tinkered it up ... altering some expressions ... adding c. 6 stanzas. He in no way improved it'.25 In addition, since 'John Barleycorn' is a drastically shorter song than 'The Pleasant Ballad', it is difficult to see how 'adding c. 6 stanzas' can fit with the alternative. (2) Jamieson was emphatic that he had 'learnt it as a boy in Morayshire, before the poems of Burns were published' (my italics). It can only be assumed that this was similar to the one Burns had only partially remembered. Although the two texts are very close, it is easy to distinguish the 'poetic' one from the 'folk' one. (3) Dixon held the view that '[Burns's] ... corrections and additions want the simplicity of the original, and certainly cannot be considered improvements'.26 Reference to 'the simplicity of the original' does not chime with 'The Pleasant Ballad', but does chime with traditional versions of 'John Barley- corn', such as the one Jamieson claimed to have remembered. (Although he confesses to adding two verses, he claims to have rendered us the rest unaltered.) (4) Three English sources of the song, one of which is definitely, and the other two of which are probably, eighteenth- century, suggest a more widespread distribution of 'John Barleycorn' at this period. A chapbook entitled The Moun- tain of Hair Garland, c. 1775,27 printed at least in London and Newcastle, if not elsewhere, includes 'John Barleycorn', and even though this text is markedly different from subsequent versions, it seems that the second re-composition had already occurred by that date. Two broadsides with no date and no printer, but almost certainly eighteenth-century in origin as judged by their appearance and text, also suggest that the re- composition was not of Bums's doing. One, subtitled 'The Flower of Eng- land', looks like the predecessor of many later versions collected from English oral tradition,28 and the second looks like the predecessor of the most popular nineteenth-century broadside text. 29 Accepting that both by date and format, 'The Pleasant Ballad' is the predecessor of 'John Barleycorn', and that the former's thirty-four verses have been reduced to about eight in most versions, how did this happen? Natural evolution, an unconscious process brought about by individual singers seems unlikely, as we know of no intermediate versions between 'The Plea- sant Ballad' and 'John Barleycorn'. It is far more likely that a person or persons re- composed the song at some stage. So did it happen once, or several times? It seems that in the main part of the story, the growth, harvesting, and processing of barley, each of the versions is related to 'The Pleasant Ballad' in almost exactly the same way (see Figure 1 and Figure 4). (Extension of this comparison to later versions reinforces this conclusion.) It is surely much less likely that several people independently decided to re-create the ballad in exactly the same way, than that such an event took place once, and these early versions evolved rapidly from one original. So, either these early five derive from a 'missing link', or one of them is the</page><page sequence="11">448 FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL PB~ Lurn LIII B LW3 LHFir BsE 3 men Et [. s a E111 I E.

If the latter, then which one is the most likely? It is this author's contention that the first line of a song has a particular importance in two respects: it is obviously critical in setting the scene for the narrative or the emotion of a song, but probably just as importantly often acts as a better aide-memoire for singers than the original title. In this study, it also turns out to be useful in tracing the subsequent development of the song. In terms of the first line, then, we have four: 'Two brothers on yonder hill' (Mountain of Hair); 'Three Men West' (Flower of England); 'Three Knights North' (Har- vard); and 'Three Kings East' (the two Scots versions). (For convenience, I shall use 'Three Knights North' as a shorthand for the first line 'There were three knights came from the North', and apply the same device to other versions of the first line. There is no intended implication that the only difference between two versions lies in their first lines, unless this is stated.) The three English versions differ in the first line, but where they have common verses, these are very similar. Figure 5 compares the two most important of these. All the 'Part A' verses, i.e. those up to the line 'The miller he served him worse than that for he ground him between two stones' appear to be derived from 'The Pleasant Ballad' (see Figure 1). The last verse is found in all the English versions, and must have been inserted de novo by the re-composer. The extra Part C verses in 'Three Men West' are taken verbatim from 'The Little Barley-Corne'. So, it looks as though 'John Barleycorn' took its Part A from 'The Pleasant Ballad', ignor- ing that song's Parts B and C, but adding a lighter Part C, mostly from 'The Little Barley-Corne' and with a rousing final verse, the whole contrasting with the somewhat miserable picture in 'The Pleasant Ballad'. (The vast majority of versions of 'John Barleycorn' omit Part B, the notable exceptions being the longest version of the song, a Sussex version collected by Mike Yates,30 and a couple of the Irish versions.) In terms of the first line, the most likely 'original' is 'Three Knights North', on the basis that 'The Pleasant Ballad' is set in 'the North Country' and has four knights, three of whom, Sir Richard Beere, Sir Thomas Good Ale, and Sir William White Wine, swear to kill the fourth, Sir John Barleycorn. This has a clear logic: all of them need 'dead' barley for their creation,</page><page sequence="14">JOHN BARLEYCORN: THE EVOLUTION OF A FOLK-SONG FAMILY 451 assuming the wine is barley wine of course. This version also retains the felon motif. However, in other verses, 'Three Men West' retains more of 'The Pleasant Ballad', such as the rarer holly clubs rather than crabtree sticks, the threshing-barn floor, and the phrase 'flesh from his bones'. It also has the extra verses already discussed. Whether these were present in the 'original' there is no means of knowing. All we can say is that the song arose either in England or Scotland, probably in the first half of the eighteenth century, and was well established as a widespread orally transmitted version in both the south-west and the north-east of Scotland in the late eighteenth century. It is interesting to note that even after a further two centuries of the re-creation of 'John Barleycorn', at least one particular set of words appears to have been regarded as already 'honed to perfection' by some singers, leading to a line of stability that has been little affected by printed versions (compare the Flower of England broadside with Dixon and Baring Gould's originally collected version in his manuscripts). 331 Whereas such stability in oral tradition is seen in other studies as dependent on printed versions, perhaps the theme of 'John Barleycorn' might make it the exception in this regard. It might also explain why the huge variation we find in this song shows no degeneracy, but a proliferation of versions of equal quality. The new arrival in the mid nineteenth century, 'Hey John Barleycorn', despite a strong presence in broadsides, had little impact on this vigorous oral tradition. Conclusion The hope that this study would reveal an evolutionary pathway for 'John Barley- corn' from an identifiable original has proved to be a little optimistic, but it has revealed a family of songs brought about by re-composition of a theme, an evolu- tionary aspect which perhaps has not received enough attention in the past, and suggested how this has been a stimulus to re-creation. Thus a sixteenth-century song based on a very good idea led to six new songs over the course of three hundred years, and it is my belief that only 'John Barleycorn' itself really cap- tured the people's imagination. It was composed in a period when probably the majority of our folk songs arose, entering a world where re-creation was rife, leading to the marked differences of text amongst even the earliest versions of the song. Perhaps the predecessors of 'John Barley- corn' served a purpose by keeping the idea alive without having the quality to thrive, eventually yielding a 'final flowering', which since its arrival in the eighteenth century has undergone the process of re- creation on a grand scale. Although the re- creators have no doubt seen some of their changes as improvements on the original, they would probably only have sung it in the first place if they considered it a 'good song', and would have probably avoided 'The Pleasant Ballad' as 'too far back' for them to work on. Once the re-composer had produced 'John Barleycorn', it was a different matter. Interestingly, species evolution shows parallels in that cataclys- mic events have often led to periods of very rapid evolution followed by periods of stability.
