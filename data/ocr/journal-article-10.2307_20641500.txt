We are now realizing that criticism, to be cre ative (hence truly radical and anti-dog matic), should have no restrictions, no "guiding" ideology. In this open critical con text, the rethinking of "politically unfash ionable" eras in Mexican/Chicano history may lead to productive paths: for instance, one could reflect on the manner in which preexisting paradigms for Mexican/Chicano "history" have conditioned?hence lim ited?the scope of Chicano cultural criti cism. One should not be surprised with the findings: Chicano studies has been deeply indebted to the counterculture of the 1960s, and to Mexico's nineteenth-century nation alist discourse of mestizaje, anti-Spanish sen timent, and Anglo-French democratic lib eralism. In other words, the "global" has been an ideological bedrock all along. Writ ing about Latin American art and the de bate on identities, Nestor Garcia Canclini analyses the problem of national represen tation as follows: The foreign 'influences' were trans lated and relocated in national ma trices, in projects which united the liberal, rationalist aspiration for mo dernity with a nationalism stamped with the romantic, by which the identity of each people could be one, distinctive and homogeneous. The pretension of constructing national cultures and representing them by specific iconographies is challenged in our time by the processes of an economic and symbolic transnation alisation. (502) Traced back to its historical begin nings, Mexico's nationalist discourse and cultural imagery constitute the political foundation of its Wars of Independence (1810-1821), of its 1824 federal constitu tion, the banner of Benito Ju?rez s genera tion, and the liberal credo of revolutionary movements that overthrew the dictatorship of Porfirio D?az. How is this political and cultural history reconfigured allegorically in the Chicano historical novel so as to inter connect the past with the lived present? How are we to analyze events such as the Mexico-United States war of 1848 (at the core of Chicano history, marking both the separation from Mexico and the origin of an "ethnic" status), or the differences be tween Ch?canos and Mexicans on the basis of an alleged "synthetic interlingualism" and cultural "authenticity" (Bruce-Novoa 17)? To briefly address these questions in relation to the historical novel, I propose the analysis of Dreams of the Centaur ( 1996) by Montserrat Fontes, a novel that recon structs, in a global context, the history of Sonora during the dictatorship of Porfirio D?az, a period when Mexico's minorities (e.g., Yaquis) mirrored the neocolonial sta tus of U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry on the northern side of the border.2 Our analy sis involves the following interpretative framework: on the one hand, as a fictional configuration of neo-colonial historical forces that would ultimately produce the conditions of possibility for the Mexican Revolution; on the other, as an ideological reconstruction of the racial and political contradictions in the state of Sonora dur ing the years 1885-1900?the most dy namic in Mexico during the Porfiriato in terms of modernization and demographic growth, as well as in its neo-colonial status in relation to the United States.3 Conceived in this way, Dreams of the Centaur allows us to imagine the true scope of the Chicano historical novel: it opens possibilities to rethink the ideological foun</page><page sequence="3">Roberto Cant? 143 dations of Chicano cultural studies, and interconnects the symbolic and political heritage of Ch?canos and Mexicans in a world context. The Chicano historical novel has tra ditionally used a family history to make sense of national and international events. These novels, written by Jos? Antonio Villarreal, Arturo Islas and Eliud Martinez, to name only a few, are (respectively) rec ollections of family affiliations during the Mexican Revolution to various political fac tions (e.g., to Francisco Villa, to Porfirio D?az), or memories of Mexican land dis possession in Texas after the Alamo and, on a larger scale, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848). For the most part, these novelists narrate the impact of said events on a family history. Fontes s novel, on the contrary, contains a hidden subtext: it tells the story of how her family played a lead ing role in the Mexican Revolution.4 In our interview, Fontes refers to her maternal line, connected to the Elias clan of Northern Sonora, as one of the biggest cattle ranch families; of Sephardic ancestry, they converted to Catholicism when the Inquisition reached Mexico. At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, Fontes s mater nal and paternal grandfathers spearheaded military forces against Porfirio Diaz. One of the grandfathers, Colonel Paulino Fontes, was a railroad promoter and a member of President Venustiano Carranzas s elite guard; the maternal grandfather, General Arnulfo R. G?mez, was a presidential candidate in 1927, running against Alvaro Obreg?n. The execution of General G?mez in Veracruz made international headlines and partly inspired one of Mexicos modern literary masterpieces, La sombra del caudillo (1928), by Mart?n Luis Guzm?n. When I asked Fontes to summarize her family history, she stated: I'm fortunate that both sides of my family have led raucous, wild, dan gerous lives. They've also suffered and dared a great deal. All of us grew up with the Fontes/G?mez clan talking about the revolution, the exiles, the suicides, the love affairs, the battles, the history, the executions. Such a robust and violent existence fits well with the stereotype that Southern Mexicans have of norte?os (Northern Mexi cans): broncos, rebeldes, francos?usually sketched on horseback in the popular imagi nation. The cognate status of these terms points to their expressive influence in the Mexico-United States border. Such a "cross ing" of borders is mediated by the symbol of the centaur who?as a half human, half beast hybrid?can be read, on the one hand, as the conventional human dichotomy be tween reason and irrationality or, on the other hand, as Latin Americas nineteenth century notion of "Civilization against Bar barism." Fontes sustains in her novel an in terplay between these two readings, hence the promise of a new national culture, or the realities of a "racial" war. Notwithstanding the acknowledg ment of mestizaje as an operating historical force in Dreams of the Centaur, Fontes has a deep sense of respect toward the Yaquis for their resistance to Mexican assimilation. When I alluded to the partiality of the novels point of view in favor of Yaqui Indi ans, Fontes responded: My concern was focusing on the clash and injustices perpetrated by the powerful upon the indigenous peoples, especially the Yaquis who have survived because they have re</page><page sequence="4">144 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies fused to be Mexican. First Confession focused on the clash of two cultures: American and Mexican. Dreams of the Centaur focuses on the clash of Mexicans with Yaqui Indians who suffered enslavement in their own land. The pattern I saw emerging as I researched Dreams of the Centaur was that no dream is fulfilled with out hostages, without victims, with out blood. Patterned after Mexican frontier themes, Dreams of the Centaur is structured accord ing to notions of hybridity, breeding, and a symbolic metamorphosis (e.g. the Centaur), thus producing an identifiable conceptual matrix that generates ideas related to civili zation (e.g., social manners, noble "breed ing") and to genetics: new hybrids, new breeds. The novel's opening paragraph? focusing on Felipas premonition of her husband's untimely death?begins with the theme of a wife's fear coupled with jealousy: she witnesses the image of the husband (Jos? Durcal) chasing after Rosario, a young Yaqui woman whose parents work in Jos?'s ranch. This opening scene underscores Jos?'s "cross breeding" inclinations, congruent with the novel's governing trope, namely: mestizaje. As anticipated, nine months later Rosario gives birth to Charco, the Yaqui youth with blue eyes and the scythe-shaped birthmark linked to Jos?'s personal fantasy of a con quistador genealogy, thematically associated with ranching and farming interests. When asked about her love of horses, Fontes dis closed the organizational "plan" of her novel: Moro symbolizes the gachup?n, the conqueror who took the Indian woman in the mestizaje. The first chapter of Dreams has the literal making of a mestizo (Jos? taking the Yaqui girl and making Charco), and the last chapter has Moro mating with the Indian Appaloosa mares, thus echoing the first chapter and symbolically repeating the mestizaje. Beyond the trope of the hybrid or mestizo, Dreams of the Centaur charts three major narrative planes that converge on the Catholic iconography of the Holy Family, Sonora-style: (1) Jos? Durcal (the father) in conflict with the economy and social strati fication of late nineteenth-century Sonora; (2) Alejos story of a sons geographic and moral journey on a nationallevel, therefore an allegory of Mexico's imperial crisis (i.e. the Diaz dictatorship); and (3) Felipas reso lution to come to terms with the loss of her husband and her first-born son, while con fronting her racial prejudices toward Yaqui Indians. Divided into three parts with a total of thirty chapters, Dreams of the Centaur contains two narrators: an omniscient voice covering parts one and three of the novel, and Alejo as the consciousness of the sec ond part, written in a first-person, diary like present tense that endows the narration with the intimacy and freshness of a his torical experience unmediated by memory. The first five chapters of the novel?a mere sixty-two pages?serve as a stage for Jos? Durcal's rise and fall during the years 1885 99, a period that corresponds to the his torical twilight of Yaqui autonomy under the leadership of Jos? Mar?a Leyva, popu larly known as Cajeme. His execution in 1887 marks the beginning of "white" (i.e. Mexican criollo) colonization of the eight Yaqui pueblos. These years also correspond to the financial era under Mexican treasurer Jos? Limantour, who shifted Mexico from the silver to the gold standard, and made</page><page sequence="5">Roberto Cant? 145 possible Porfirio Diaz's railroad boom dur ing the years 1888-94 (Meyer 442). After the initial five chapters, the narrative be comes the setting for Alejos various rites of passage, abruptly slowing to a sustained narrative rhythm so as to cover only one year (1900) in almost three hundred pages. The novel's framework of temporal succes sion is thus constructed according to nar rative principles governing (1) an archetypal story of a hero's revenge, wanderings, and nostos5 (subverted in the novel in the form of a hero's maturation, homecoming, and subsequent exile), and (2) a symbolic figu ration of a nation's neo-colonial history. Such a framework can be visualized in an ordering relation that reveals the temporal and thematic interconnectedness in the novel's parts and sequence of chapters: Part One A C 1885 1892 1899 Chap. 1 Chaps. 2-5 Chaps. 6-12 (pp. 17-31) (pp. 31-62) (pp. 62-182) Part Two Part Three D E 2 months later One month later (Jan. 1900) Chaps. 13-20 Chaps. 21-30 (pp. 185-251) (pp. 255-349) Read according to its thematic se quence, Part One of the novel contains a cluster of plot features that include (A) Jos? Durcal's economic ascendancy in Alamos, Sonora, and (B) his murder. With Jos?'s death, the narrative shifts to (C) Alejo, Jos?'s first-born, who immediately enters into sev eral rites of passage that include revenge; incarceration in the bartolinas (the infamous prison caves that passed as jails during the Porfirio D?az era); conscription; and (Part Two, D) a national journey that takes Alejo from Sonora to Yucat?n, hence from Yaqui to Maya territories. Interpreted as a subtext, Mexico's national history finds its elabora tion through a crisis in a colonial economy, as portrayed by Jos? Durcal's emphasis on ranching and farming, and his vehement opposition to foreign mining interests in Sonora, represented in great part by the United States. In other words, his death by murder underscores, if only at a symbolic level, the growing presence of international investments in Mexico. As a textual corol lary, the June 1, 1906 strike organized by Mexican miners in Sonora against Colonel Greene's Cananea Consolidated Copper Company?a strike that was motivated politically by the reemergence of liberalism under the Mag?n brothers?can be under stood, thanks to the perspective given by hindsight, to be the unmasking of Porfirio Diaz's neo-colonial policy, namely: to pro tect the interests of foreigners at the expense of Mexican nationals (Meyer 488).6 Caught between a father s dreams and a mother's "psychic" connection, Alejos re venge and subsequent national journey are thus composed of tests and rites of initia tion, symbolically "coming into the world" as an adult, ready to take his father's place in a ranching economy. With his return from Yucat?n (narrated in Part Three, E), Alejo undergoes yet another trial, this time by fire: his participation on the Yaqui side against Mexico's federal army in the Battle of Mazocoba (1900), a battle that?from the perspective of Fontes's novel?foreshad ows the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Overall, there are a total of three tests or initiatory rites, one for each part of the novel, beginning with the taming of Moro under the guidance of Tacho, an old Yaqui, friend and mentor of Alejos father. Sec ondly, the Yucat?n rite of Pan-Mexican In dian solidarity, hence symptomatic of a "na tive" way of imagining the nation in direct opposition to that of the criollo caste that</page><page sequence="6">146 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies ruled Mexico under Porfirio D?az. This sec ond rite is overseen by Anginas, an old Maya who survives persecution from the hacen dados. Lastly, the Battle of Mazocoba, an event that logically unifies the previous two rites in the context of a nations growing crisis, namely: the imminent downfall of the Porfiriato. Seen in this light, the year 1892 (Part One, B) stands in symmetrical rela tion to 1900 (Part Three, E): one marks the fourth centennial of Columbus s discovery of America; the other, a symbolic pan-In dian banner of democracy and national unification. In 1892?shortly before his death?Jos? remembers Cajemes Yaqui in surrection against Mexicos federal army, and mourns his 1887 execution: Hearing of Cajemes last moments, Jos? wept openly. [...] Alone or in public he sang corridos about Caje me?not the songs that described his death, but those that heralded his hero's bravery. (33) In 1900, and about to leave Yucat?n, Alejo hears Anginas s melody humming through him: "turn Sonora into a land of generos ity. Tell them what you saw here. When they enslave men there, they enslave us here. Tell them" (250). The novel's ending turns against the expectations that govern a literary genre like romance. In Dreams of the Centaur, the he roic quest is set aside, presenting us instead with a sixteen-year old Alejo quietly settling down across the Mexican border, dreaming of breeding horses and of spending his life with Ana Maria. The psychic connection between son and mother thus comes to an end with Ana Maria's love, and Alejo?see ing his mother "for the last time"?is trans formed into the father redivivus, now a liv ing incarnation of Jos? Durcal insofar as his dream was to breed cattle that would with stand the Southwestern heat and, through hard work, keep the ranch like a wheel, turn ing by itself. The novels ideological mission, con sequently, is made evident in its solidarity with Yaqui autonomy and in its examples of Yaqui appropriation of Christian ritual and iconography. One of these examples is the taming of Moro. Alejos rite of initia tion (performed in chapter 7) soon turns into a metaphorical battle, orchestrated by Tacho into a war between Christians and Moors, a conflict layered with a symbolism that applies both to the rite of maturation (Alejo taming Moro) and to an ancient con quistador history (specifically, the Spanish Reconquista waged against Spanish Moors). The ritualized war is organized by Tacho through chromatic symbolism (blue for Christian, red for Moor) and as a Yaqui in ternalization of the "enemy," thereby achiev ing a frontier metamorphosis of the self that is textually constructed through the image of a baptism: "Today you and Moro will enact the part of Moors attacking the church. I will be the Christians trying to force you into the water to baptize you" (107-08). This theater of reenactment that associates a remote event (Christians against Moors) with a contemporaneous historical conflict (Mexicans against Yaquis) illumi nates not only Tachos vulnerable condition in the Sonora of his time, but also under scores one of the novel's salient structural features: the telescoping of different national eras prior to Porfirio Diaz's downfall. Ta chos precarious state is confirmed shortly after Moro's taming (113-16) when, after meeting a group of rurales (Porfirio Diaz's version of the Texas Rangers), he is bound and taken away with six other Yaqui Indi ans. Alejo never sees him again.</page><page sequence="7">Roberto Cant? 147 Between parts One and Three (thus between 1885-1990), Sonora is portrayed as a region undergoing rapid economic changes fostered by a developing global market. In accordance with the expanding industrialization of both Europe and the United States, the emphasis is on Mexican natural resources, illustrated in the novel by Sonoras minerals, henequ?n from Yucat?n, sugar from the fields of Oaxaca and Mo relos, and oil from Veracruz. Jos? warned against foreign investors from the United States coming into Sonora to colonize Yaqui lands. He pushed for a Mexican-owned rail road to link Alamos to Guaymas and Hermosillo. [...] His stand for Yaqui autonomy drew angry criticism from friends. Felipa never argued with his long tirades, but it was clear she could never be convinced of Yaquis coexisting peacefully with Mexicans. Jos? refused to cooperate with gov ernment orders that miners, ranch ers, and farmers count and report the number of Yaquis they had working for them. He urged fellow ranchers not to obey the authorities. (57) Another glance at the narrative struc ture allows us to reinsert in our analysis a corrido written by Fontes, titled "El Corrido de los Durcal," found at the beginning of the novel. This corrido raises expectations in the reader, who assumes it belongs to the Mexican vs. Anglo frontier variety, such as the traditional ballad "El Corrido de Gre gorio Cort?s"; on first impression, it appears to be a thematic overture to the novel, pro viding the reader with a synoptical reduc tion of the novel's conflict. Deployed as a distant variant of the theme of the Recon quista, "El Corrido de los Durcal" tells the story of two compadres?Jos? Durcal and Esteban Escobar?who covet the same horse (Moro); however, more than just good friends who are divided by a common de sire, they represent, respectively, the enter prising Mexican farmer and Sonoras old ranching elite allied to international min ing interests, mostly of the United States. Jos? Durcal embodies fundamental changes in the image itself of a centaur and the dreams that are correlate to the condi tion: he is an orphan with no knowledge of who his father was; moreover, he is from Sinaloa, hence not a native of Sonora; lastly, he carries a stranger s surname (therefore the implicit shadow of the social counterfeit): No, she would not tell Alejo the story a mezcal-filled Jos? had told her one night. How he had taken the name Durcal from a newspaper in Sinaloa, because "it sounded strong." Jos? had been barely older than Alejo when, after burying his mother, he had migrated to Sonora. [...] She had sup ported her son by washing, ironing; alongside Indians, he had worked other men's fields, designed another life for himself [...]. (137-38) Jos? represents the Romantic hero as well as the rising "new man" of the frontier, belonging to the social category most likely to establish alliances with the Yaqui Indi ans. Jos?'s wife?daughter of the Spanish born Octavio Robles?is the Mexican fe male from Sonora who fears and hates Yaqui Indians; knowing that her mother was mur dered by Yaquis, Felipas marriage to Jos? becomes a personal test, first in having Yaquis around the ranch as hired hands, then jealous of their daughters who become the object of her husbands sexual desires.7 Felipas character thus operates at levels proper to cultural criticism; molded by ex perience and personal losses (e.g. a mur</page><page sequence="8">148 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies dered husband, a jailed son), Felipas char acter seems to suggest that an index of our humanity is our constant self-examination, accompanied by a willingness to endure loss and suffering, for after all "no dream is ful filled without hostages, without victims, without blood." The theme of self-exami nation and penance becomes, as a result, a guiding moral continuum in Felipas char acter evolution, reaching a moment of rec ognition close to the end of the novel, when she wishes for an Indian wife for her son: I wished a good Indian woman?to serve him. Ashamed of her disloy alty to her son and to Carmen, Felipa makes a rushed sign of the cross, vows to the sky to let her sons marry who they want. [...] Vows can't change this ugly rejection of people like me and those whom Jos? called Mexico's primera gente. Jos? was a better person. [...] People like me al low the Mazocobas that maimed my son. (328-29) In this passage the almost unregistered shift from omniscient to first-person would seem to underscore a purpose: instead of the usual paraphrase of Felipas thoughts and point of view, we now witness, as it were, her new understanding of a formerly hated Other, the Yaqui Indian. As a formal feature that determines or shapes our reading of the novel, the first-person interventions by Felipa and Alejo become the sites of suffer ing, metaphorical death, and rebirth of a national consciousness. Read in this light, Felipas thoughts regarding colonial preju dices, such as "forbidden" marriages {criollo + Yaqui Indian), are equivalent to a personal resolution of the ethnic/criollo conflicts in nineteenth-century Porfirian society. As we read Dreams of the Centaur, we can at first orient ourselves easily through the coordinates of history, cultural geogra phy, and the many references to a daily ranch routine in northern Mexico; however, with the constant overlapping of historical planes and colonial "types" (e.g. Indian, con quistador, mestizo, etc.), our analysis ad vances with the knowledge that somehow both historical planes and colonial types constitute a mural-like montage of the en tire spectrum of Mexican history, from pre Columbian to the Porfiriato. As our read ing experience overcomes this initial disrup tion caused by the synchronicity of the nonsynchronic, we begin to understand the novels organizing principles: on a surface level, it illustrates a fractured nation, with less "evolved" or quasi-integrated frontier regions that continue to thrive at the mar gins of "civilization." Consequently, the So nora frontier is revealed as the site where the Conquest continues (hence the "war of extermination" over land and river rights against the Yaqui Indians) during an era of increasing industrialization, foreign invest ments, and a shift from ranching and min ing to a global market economy. Market routes also function ironically in the novel, as is the case with goods that are traded be tween Sonora and Yucat?n. Thus we read that Jos? Durcal orders "precious hardwood and rope made of the finest henequ?n" from Yucat?n (35); he buys a "stuffed quetzal" from Guatemala, "near Yucat?n" (41); later the rope around Moro's neck?a sign of captivity?is identified as being made of henequ?n from Yucat?n (122); lastly, Jos? Durcals coffin is made of a "Yucat?n log" (70). This thematic network based on dis tant trade routes?reminiscent of ancient trade in quetzal feathers and precious woods in pre-Columbian Mexico?is later in the novel revealed as part of an international economy of deforestation and Yaqui en slavement. Given Jos? Durcals positive</page><page sequence="9">Roberto Cant? 149 identification with Indians, his burial in a coffin made of Yucat?n wood somehow encloses its own literary and historical logic. Symbolically, in Fontes's novel Yuca t?n is the land where Pacal "resurrects" as the youthful incarnation of the ancient lord of Palenque, and where Alejo kills the plan tation's majocol (foreman or overseer) in the form of a metaphorical decapitation ("I bring it full force down on his head. Mar tino is silent. A bloody stain swells around his head" 240). This intertextual connec tion to the Popol Vuh and, by extension, to Quich? methods of war?associated with the hunt, the harvest, and astronomical cal culations?underscores a Mexican military history with a trajectory of conflict and mestizaje as identifiable steps towards na tionhood, therefore with major nodal points that could be drawn from the Spanish Con quest to the Battle of Mazocoba and the Mexican Revolution. Ill We arrive, inevitably, to the question regarding the novel's protagonist, and we may easily be persuaded, particularly on a first reading, that Alejos role corresponds to the main character. One's initial discom fort with such a choice, however, might prompt a more complex solution that turns instead to a character system, thus allowing us to question reading tendencies based on categories such as "well-rounded," "flat," or stock characters. In his interpretation of characters in terms of their narrative func tions or as bearers of action, Fredric Jameson offers a way to demystify the "illusions" of anthropomorphic representation: [...] in strategic cases what seems to be a single unified character, held to gether by a proper name, can under narrative analysis be revealed as an uneasy plurality of quite distinct actants or functions, a structural co existence rather than an organic sub stance or 'identity.' (49-50) Such a reading of the character sys tem in Dreams of the Centaur produces an allegorical typology, with characters that represent diachronically a recapitulation of Mexico's history and, synchronically, a col lective pr?figuration of nationhood. The novel's focus on colonial types in a caste like hierarchy (e.g. the Indian, the conquis tador, the criollo, the mestizo) could then be viewed as a character "held together by a proper name" (e.g. Durcal), thus allowing for a different reading of the narrative func tions of a hybrid genealogy (i.e. Jos? Durcal, Alejo, and Charco) through a trans-indi vidual typology of three characters whose intersection?in addition to their common blood lines?takes place in the collective desire for a homeland. This interpretative framework would also produce other read ings of the novel's second part, particularly in relation to its vocabulary of fragmenta tion, moral decay, and symbolic resurrec tion. Narrated by Alejo in the present tense, as a Robles and not as a Durcal (therefore as a collaborator?even if unwilling?in the enslavement of Yaqui Indians), the narra tion simulates a confession, much like Fontes's first novel. When they arrive at the Hacienda de San Jacinto in Yucat?n, both Alejo and Charco realize the results of their complicity, as bartolina soldiers, with Mexi co's treatment of Yaquis and other Mexican ethnic groups: Torches throw light and dark shad ows across the faces of men and women. I see enough for me to iden tify eyes and cheekbones. Yaquis. Body, numb, I pray God forgives me. [...] Charco and I exchange glances.</page><page sequence="10">150 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies I know his next question. 'Yaquis?' Yes. Also Mayas, Mayos, Chinos, Coreanos. (227) The international dimension of Mexi co's "slave labor" during the Porfiriato is rendered through totalitarian or Nazi-like imagery, contributing to the novel's double movement of recapitulation and pr?figura tion, a telling anachronism that functions as the historical "double" of Diaz's dicta torship, namely: Hitler's Germany: We arrived with the Yaquis packed into cattle cars. Tired federales and bartolina soldiers stood in admira tion as fresh, precision soldiers formed a human corral to escort the Yaquis to an army post. The soldiers' uniforms were spotless. Boots too. The men moved as if commanded by a single mind. I remembered the inside of Father's watch. (209) Fontes's language reinforces menral associations with Nazi Germany in a vo cabulary of dehumanizarion, either through zoomorphic transformations (Yaquis in "cattle cars") or through a technological mutation of robot-like beings ("precision soldiers," "commanded by a single mind," "the inside of Father's watch"). In an appar ently deliberate association of German and Mexican totalitarian practices, the narrative puns with the words "forbidden" and the German Verboten as paradigmatic of a Nazi "disciplinarian" discourse: One of the foremen comes to the cen ter. 'Running away is forbidden. Fail ure to meet your daily quota of two thousand leaves is forbidden. Abuse of a henequ?n plant is forbidden. All fighting is forbidden.' (227-28) Obviously, Mexico during the Diaz dicta torship was not an empire, but a country whose neo-colonial status was hidden un der the fa?ade of modernization and Porfirio Diaz's motto, "Order and Progress." When asked by Charco if Mexicans are the enemies of Mayas, Anginas answers: 'Mexicans aren't our enemies. They too have lost their country.' He points to the English flag on the steamboat. 'Diaz is giving it away to the se?ores distinguidos.' (220) Close to the end of Part Two, Alejo kills for the second time (Martino, the plantation's majocol), generating a profile of a hero whose destiny will leave traces of blood, either for reasons of revenge or po litical convictions. The rest of Part Two cor responds to Alejos symbolic death and res urrection near a sacred tree, the Maya ceiba known as the flamboy?n, thus suggesting the theme of "paradise regained" (let's remem ber, however, that Alejos journey back to Sonora in the company of Gustavo and Charco ends in war and exile). As Part Two comes to an end, Alejo experiences the dis solution of a personal ego?highly sugges tive of a metaphorical death?and the merg ing into a collective entity known in Maya as In lak'echy thus concluding with a double theme: Alejos completion of his second rite of initiation under Maya guidance, and the symbolic reunification of Mexico's criollo and ethnic groups into a national body: I'm empty and weak with a sweet tiredness I've yearned for all my life.

All and none. My eyes open and</page><page sequence="11">Roberto Can t? 151 my gaze falls on Charco. His face is mine. Gustavo, Juan, Anginas are me. In hk'ech. (251) The three types?the conquistador, the criollo, and the mestizo?appear in the novels first part, representing the early co lonial (XVI-XVII), the late colonial (XVIII XIX), and the post-colonial inhabitant of New Spain/Mexico, respectively. One can identify all three in the following charac ters: Esteban Escobar (the son of a local wealthy hacendado), Jos? Durcal (proud of being "blanco y decente" [26], but able to speak Yaqui fluently [38]), and his sons Alejo and Charco, who stand for Mexicos tradition of egalitarian politics and national identity, as constructed through mestizaje. The conflict and resolutions are telling: the two friends die violently, leaving Alejo to his national wanderings, inner transforma tion (with a change of surname?Durcal to Robles?as an index of his relations with Mexicos Indians), a found "double" in Charco, a political alliance with Yaquis, and an anticipated wedding with Ana Maria at the novel's conclusion. At this point in our reading we begin to trace a pattern of three characters, a rhe torical continuum that can be read as one of historical contrasts and of blood rela tions. For instance, Alejo has two broth ers?H?ctor and Andr?s?who collectively represent a transition from ranch to city life; on the other hand, during his journey to Yucat?n, Alejo is accompanied by two "blood" brothers, Charco and Gustavo Salda?a: the former is Jos?'s son with a Yaqui woman (hence, Alejos half brother); the lat ter is the son of a criollo landowner (hence, Alejos historical "twin"): "The Salda?as are wealthy hacendados from northern Sonora. Gustavo told us that he studied in Europe" (205). Gustavo speaks French, is destined to a position of power in his father s haci enda, and yet his destiny is elsewhere: he dies in the battlefield alongside Yaquis in Mazocoba (or so we thought, however Fon tes might "resurrect" Gustavo in her forth coming novel, The Generals Widow). As if to symbolize their blood and "psychic" con nection, both Alejo and Charco fall in love with women who share a name and an "alien" condition: Luz Mar?a (a Yaqui young female) and Ana Maria (a Mexican Ameri can woman); the former is never seen by Charco again after she vanishes in the Yucat?n fields; the latter, a woman ten years older than Alejo, turns into the symbol of Alejos maturation as they prepare for their nuptials. As the former wife of Rafael Castillo?Alejos protector and father fig ure ("My own father couldn't have done more for me," 348)?Ana Maria functions as the character who displaces Felipa as a mother-figure. Moreover, at the novels con clusion, it is evident that Charco has be come Alejos "double" or filial replacement, therefore an heir of Jos? Durcals property in Sonora. The motif of the three brothers can ultimately be read as an allegory of Sonoras history of Yaqui-Mexican conflicts over land and river rights. One of the best histories on the subject is La frontera n?mada, by H?ctor Aguilar Camin, who writes of how the Salido brothers (Jos?, Juan, and Martin) invaded the Valle del Mayo in 1865, thus beginning?during the first years of the French occupation of Mexico (1863-67)? the "first phase" of a regional policy of ex termination and land dispossession against Mexico's Yaqui and Mayo nations. The Salido brothers?maternal ancestors of president Alvaro Obreg?n (1920-24)? called their hacienda and the water canal by the same name: Tres Hermanos ("Three Brothers"). According to Camin:</page><page sequence="12">152 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies La f?rtil regi?n, largamente ambicio nada por los proyectos de colonizaci?n blanca, encontr? en los Salido las pun tas de lanza civiles, la instigaci?n con creta para los designios blancos de ex pulsi?n del dominio ind?gena. Las ha ciendas de los Salido proporcionaron los contundentes argumentos econ? micos del caso y proveyeron la expecta tiva de la agricultura intensa y t?cnica que despu?s caracterizar?a a la regi?n. (23) The second phase, composed of twelve years (1875-87), belongs to a Yaqui rebel lion under Cajemes leadership, who tem porarily obtained an independent territo rial jurisdiction for Yaqui Indians. With Cajeme s capture and execution on April 21, 1887, a new generation of hacendados was created, composed mostly of the military who defeated Cajeme (e.g. General Luis Torres), and of migrant farmers from the neighboring states of Sinaloa and Jalisco. Lastly, the third phase would correspond to Aguilar Camin's account of how between 1888 and 1896, General Torres sold 15,000 hectares of Yaqui lands to an investor by the name of E. Salisbury, who in turn sold the lands to California farmers (48). Not to be left behind, Carlos Conant founded the Sonora &amp; Sinaloa Irrigation Company with stocks owned by New York investors who, by 1901, pulled away their capital from Sonora because of Yaqui uprisings (49). According to Aguilar Camin, the Yaqui "problem" had unfortunate results: Mexico s war of extermination against Yaqui Indians, their deportation to Yucat?n, and the dramatic reduction in Sonoras agricul tural fields of its pool of "cheap labor," his torically obtained from Yaqui Indians. Ironi cally, with the increasing penetration of U.S. interests in Sonoras mining and ranching economy, the local hacendados will begin to rethink their "neo-colonial" status as simi lar to that of the Yaqui Indians. The ideo logical terrain was ripe for a recovery of Mexico's tradition of liberal democracy, ac companied by a growing sentiment in fa vor of an insurrection against Porfirio D?az: "El gobierno [...] deb?a velar por los intereses de los sonorenses, no por los norteame ricanos [...] y cumplir con las leyes" (78). On this basis?war and land annex ation?was created the Ilustraci?n sonorense (Sonoras Enlightenment) during the years 1888-1902, with massive land develop ments and irrigation projects in the eight former Yaqui pueblos. What followed was totally unexpected by Sonoras criollo elite: the "colonial takeover" of Sonora by U.S. capital. A retrospective look at the novel's historical focus reveals the importance of the chosen years (1885-1900) in the drama that was unfolding both in Sonora as well as in the rest of Mexico. This reading of Fontes's historical novel would allow us to identify?back in the conventional category of a novel's pro tagonist?Jos? and Alejo as the fictional co protagonists whose political desires fore shadow Mexico's post-Revolutionary era as the homeland of all Mexicans, regardless of race or ethnic background. Concomitantly, Charcos "homeless" condition in the novel (as a criollo/Yaqui mestizo) situates him as the character whose desire for some sort of homecoming could identify him as the novel's historical (albeit not fictional) pro tagonist. This analysis would also resolve a problem if Dreams of the Centaur is to be interpreted as a national allegory: the mur der (Jos?'s) and final exile (Alejos) of the fictional co-protagonists leaves the hero's homecoming to Charco. Close to the end of the novel, Charco tells Felipa of his mother's probable death by hanging in a miner's camp, and of his</page><page sequence="13">Roberto Can t? 153 sense of belonging to "something big?like the sky up there, only bigger." The obvious reference to heaven, and Charcos tears, prompt a maternal response from Felipa: "Meanwhile, Charco [...] come to your father's ranch, because on earth, that's where you belong. That's what's right" (347). A few pages later Felipa?a name that means "lover of horses" if read through its Greek etymology?prepares her solitary return to Alamos, while Alejo remains with Ana Maria in Arizona with plans to produce a new breed of horses. Before Felipa departs, she reminds Charco: "Remember I'm wait ing. [...] Tu casa est? en Alamos" (349). The novel's conclusion, therefore, is motivated by a "desire" of its own, hence the "hybrid resolution" it offers to the future of Sonora: with the Mexican Revolution, it should have belonged to the criollo/Yaqui mestizos like Charco, thus resolving through mestizaje the colonial problems that began centuries ago with the conquest of Mexico. Of course, given that such a hybrid resolution did not occur in Sonora, one could dismiss this interpretation as yet an other example of a novel's imaginary reso lution to a real historical contradiction. But as Fredric Jameson reminds us, the struc tural paradox of the historical novel is to interpret the historical past through the present; read from this interpretive angle, Dreams of the Centaur situates itself in an ironic position in regards to the Chicano historical novel that treats, for instance, the fate of Californios as an anticipatory example of the land loss and political powerlessness of present-day Ch?canos. The tacit argu ment would run as follows: the historical contradiction found in Anglo-American settlers/squatters and Californio landown ers after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is homologous to that of Mexicans and Yaqui Indians in Sonora from the nine teenth century to the present. In most Chicano historical accounts of Mexican land dispossession at the hands of Anglo-Americans, one seldom finds ref erences to the injustices suffered by Native Americans during the years of colonial Spanish-Mexican expansion. In their intro duction to Mar?a Amparo Ruiz de Burtons The Squatter and the Don, a novel originally published in San Francisco in 1885, Rosaura Sanchez and Beatrice Pita write: Interestingly, unlike Helen Hunt Jackson's novel, Ramona, published in 1884, The Squatter and the Don avoids addressing the dispossession of the Indians, seen here only as ranch hands and servants. (8) A few pages later, these critics add the fol lowing observation: That Indian lands are considered public lands' is certainly not ques tioned in the novel; in fact those lands are said to be there for the squatters' taking, if only they would. (32) Interestingly, one could add, The Squatter and the Don proposes a "hybrid resolution" of its own, for according to the same crit ics: a new [ethnic] construct is suggested in the intermarriage of Californios and Anglos to produce new mesti zos' like Mariano Mechlin or Jose fina Alamar. These children thus also embody a resolution, which can be read ethnically or culturally, that is, as constructs of acculturation. (34 35) What remains, obviously, is a "reso lution" that continues to operate at an ideo</page><page sequence="14">154 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies logical level, with hardly any significant an choring in historical reality. In our inter view, Fontes addresses such a disjunction between the history and the fiction in Dreams of the Centaur. As to the narrative s point of view be ing an exception to how most Sono renses viewed the Yaquis, that is true then and now. The Mexicans (yoris) and the Yoemem (Yaquis) still live separately and view each other with suspicion and hostility. This is a gen eralization of which I am well aware; however, a trip into the Yaqui pueb los will bear out what I am saying. Any conversation with the people of Ciudad Obreg?n will also uncover their hostilities. [...] And yes, the novel is more concerned with an ideological perspective rather than an ethnographical analysis of Sonoras residents. The history of Sonora has particular features that set it apart from Mexico's na tional history, as has been well argued by Aguilar Camin; one could perhaps propose parallel "dissimilarities" in former Maya ter ritories, from Yucat?n to Chiapas. The fact remains, however, that these frontier re gions?with their native populations threat ening to secede from Mexico at different moments in history?question by their mere "ethnic" presence the empirical limi tations of the hybrid ideological construct, imagined by Mexican liberals of the nine teenth century as a foil against a colonial caste system and as a means to achieve the egalitarianism promised by liberal democ racy. One finds, fortunately, a way out of this "socially symbolic" dilemma in a Chi cano historical novel?Voice-Haunted Jour ney, by Eliud Martinez?where Mexico's mul tiple ancestries?as "recovered" by an act of consciousness in Texas, another frontera n?mada?overwhelm, as it were, the para digm of the mestizo or hybrid. In Voice Haunted Journey, Miguel Vel?squez must invent?in the sense of rethinking, imag ining, and reconstructing?a sense of "be ing" beyond the body, namely: as a partici pant in a collective history that has been shaped by the contradictions, both global and regional, in the Mexico-United States frontier. IV An instructive debate took place in 1980 in the Academia Mexicana de la His toria when Josefina Zoraida V?zquez gave her speech, "El dilema de la ense?anza de la historia de Mexico," as required of every new member admitted into this exclusive academy. Her respondent was Edmundo O'Gorman, one of Mexicos leading histo rians and known for his sharp wit and love of polemics?and, no less significant, a former teacher of Dr. V?zquez. O'Gorman's response was titled "El estado y la verdad hist?rica," and such was the importance of both speeches that they were immediately published in the journal Di?logos shortly after their presentation. Briefly stated, the polemic turned on what version of Mexico's history should be taught at the elementary level. As Dr. V?z quez noted, the circulation of books in pri mary schools often contained contradictory versions of Mexican history, some with the liberal version (with its anti-Spanish, anti Porfirio Diaz, anti-clerical, and pro-Revo lution biases), while others stressed the con servative version, which included Mexico's Spanish colonial history and pro-Catholi cism.8 Dr. V?zquez proposed that the State (with the advise of educators) should be</page><page sequence="15">Roberto Cant? 155 responsible for an updated and standard ized version of Mexicos national history, and that it be implemented in all primary schools of the nation. In a respectful but combative tone, O'Gorman expressed his opposition to this proposal. Instead of an "official version" of Mexico's national history, he suggested a version hist?rica to be produced by histori ans not tied to the State's ideological inter ests. In other words, the teaching of a na tional history should be the task of educa tors, and not of instructors collaborating with politicians. At the core of the peda gogical mission was the question, What to stress in Mexican history: its Indian, its Hispanic, or its mestizo historical versions? Clearly, this was a rhetorical question, for the mestizo version was the national con struction of nineteenth-century liberal thought, a political legacy claimed by the Revolution of 1910, and?viewed from the perspective of the 1968 Tlatelolco student massacre?"perverted" by Mexico's leading political party. O'Gorman argued that, contrary to received opinion, the Mexican Revolution is not the fulfillment nor the continuation of the nineteenth-century liberal construct of the mestizo. Understood in the context of their own regional dispersion and het erogeneous complexity, Mexicans?after the 1910 revolution?were finally able to view themselves as agents in an historical pro cess that promised a new sense of the na tion, so that being "Mexican" no longer had anything to do with ethnic differences or "racial" mixtures. Thus, the Indian and crio llo national projects are considered by O'Gorman as historically obsolete; in his view, the Mexican Revolution created the possibilities for the conception of Mexican identity beyond a "colonial" or racial model. Although an independent thinker, O'Gor man's argument contained echoes of ideas expressed by other writers, such as Jos? Ortega y Gasset, Jos? Gaos, and Octavio Paz?who has had the misfortune of being generally misread by most Chicano/a liter ary critics. Although belonging to different generations and to different countries, the ideas of these writers (and I name only a few) are also a legacy and a logical entry into the global that must be claimed by Chicano cultural studies. Before concluding, we must setaside the anecdotal elements in the narrative so as to focus on the historical forces that? registered in the novel as ideological under pinnings?remain nonetheless beyond the structural limits of Mexico's nationalism, notions of hybridity, or ideals of liberal de mocracy. In other words, as we read through the narrative, one comes across references to foreign workers, fortune seekers, and immigrants (e.g. Hong, Billy Cameron, Octavio Robles); international mining and oil companies, new technologies, and mul tinational capital, with neo-colonial results on the culture and the economy of Mexico. Lastly, one finds allusions to ideological models imported from metropolitan cen ters (e.g. positivism). In the novel's attempts to trace a world context around its anec dotal center, the above global forces insinu ate a historical "sublime" that, by defini tion, evades representation. According to Garcia Canclini, these same forces or processes have liquidated eth nic or national mono-identities that insist on holding on to their local exoticism and non-temporal essence (505). Although his observations address the problematic of Latin American art in today's international market, their relevance to areas in Chicano</page><page sequence="16">156 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies cultural criticism and literary theory can serve to bring this study to a close. Viewed from his vantage point, the contemporary debate on identities has resulted in a "dis cordant" dialogue between nationalist fun damentalism and an abstract globalisation. Garcia Canclini proposes a way out of this impasse: Like todays identities, their works [those of Latin American artists] are polyglot and migrant, they can func tion in diverse and multiple contexts and permit divergent readings from their hybrid constitution. (505) Having found the way to reformulate the "false" dilemma facing Latin American artists, Garcia Canclini admits the obstacles and conflicts that some of these same art ists will have with fellow artists, the public, state promotions, and museums and galler ies, who demand that Latin American art obey market expectations: [T]he strategies of the market, of in ternational exhibitions and of the critics almost always banish it [Latin American art] to the margins as the magic realism of local colour. Even when our people migrate extensively and a large part of our art work and literature is dedicated to thinking about the multicultural, Latin Ame rica continues to be interesting only as a continent of a violent nature, of an archaicism irreducible to modern nationality, an earth fertilised by an art conceived as tribal or national dreaming and not as thinking about the global and the complex. (499 500) Dreams of the Centaur depicts Sonoras violent nature, and yet it "thinks" the glo bal and the complex; it speaks of tribal and national dreaming, but its purpose is to re think Mexico's multicultural history. The novel also maintains an ironic affiliation with the modern Latin American novel in its tacit proposal: American democracy re quires that "sat?lite" countries be governed by dictatorships friendly to U.S. interests. Organized as an historical montage, the novel can be read as a vast mural where pre Columbian Mexico, the Spanish empire, post-Independence Mexico, and the mod ern world converge simultaneously in So nora with?at first glance?hardly a chance of producing the "hybridity" or mestizaje that could resolve Mexico's social and eth nic contradictions after the Mexican Revo lution of 1910.9 And yet that is precisely the telos in Fontes's novel, namely: to trace the historical forces that were leading the nation towards revolution and unification. But symbolic resolutions aside, we feel cer tain that we are reading?embedded into the fictionality of Dreams of the Centaur? a family history of revolution, exiles, sui cides, love affairs, battles, and executions: a history of the Fontes/G?mez clan whose members suffered and dared a great deal. Notes 1 As most of these critics admit, Luis Leal proposed this project in 1973, and yet it took two decades to heed his call. Why? The response might be explained by the year 1992, the nega tive imagery it brought to mind (Christopher Columbus and the expansion of European em pires in the Americas), and the many debates it elicited. On the other hand, the question regard ing a Chicano literary history with origins in the Spanish colonial era is problematic (i.e., if constructed on an alleged trans-historical mode of existence that is "unique" to Chicano/as), and yet the critical positions that support it are prom ising. 2 Fontes s first novel, First Confession (1991), is a hermetic critique of Mexico's leading politi</page><page sequence="17">Roberto Cant? 157 cal party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, and of its policies of national development be tween the presidencies of Miguel Alem?n (1946 52) and Gustavo Diaz Ordaz (1964-70), poli tics that were also challenged during the 1968 student rebellion that coincided with Mexico's hosting of the Olympic Games. In Dreams of the Centaur, Fontes manifests her sense of his tory as posed by her family's anti-Porfirian poli tics and violent connections to Mexico's post revolutionary government, in particular that of Plutarco Elias Calles (1924-28). Fontes's pub lished novels, consequently, could be read as a constant reflection on Mexico's failed attempts to establish a liberal democracy. 3 Fontes's tacit refusal to essentialize power and greed through racial categories can be read in the Yaqui-Mexican conflicts, interpreted as a direct analog of the contradictions that define Chicano history in the United States (e.g., the "racial" persecution of Mexicans in post-1848 years, the dispossession of lands, the continu ous transgressions to the tradition of liberal de mocracy in the United States, etc.). 4For information on Montserrat Fontes's life background and published novels, consult my article entitled "Montserrat Fontes" in Dictio nary of Literary Biography, and my interview with the author. 5Nostos: the Homeric return home?the Ulysses theme. 6According to Michael Meyer, between the years 1880-90 three mining developments with American, French, and German capital began on a large scale in Mexico; these large mining enterprises were based in Coahuila, Chihuahua, and in Baja California. The mines "made a for tune for its owners" (Meyer 447). Foreign in vestments came later in the form of "huge con glomerates," among them the Guggenheim in terests, with plants in Nuevo Le?n, Chihuahua, Durango, and San Luis Potos?. By the year 1902, "Guggenheim investments in northern Mexico totaled some $12 million" (Meyer 448). Lastly, Sonoras Cananea Consolidated Copper Com pany was owned by Colonel William Greene? the "copper king of Sonora"?with stocks sold in Wall Street. At the helm of one the leading copper mines in the world, Greene s huge earn ings allowed him to turn to Sonoras lumber and ranching interests; he is claimed to have owned close to forty thousand head of cattle in his Sonora ranch (Meyer 448). 7Accounts of Yaqui culture and history are a developing genre in Mexican-American litera ture, and well established in novels by Ana Castillo, Alfredo Vea, and Alma Luz Villanueva. In most cases, a Yaqui ancestry forms an impor tant part of the characters' family background, but factored in as a "repressed" spirit of insur rection and vitality that somehow must be 1) liberated through art (e.g. Ana Castillos char acter, the artist Pastora Vel?squez Ak? ["Ak? was Yaqui. Her maternal grandfather was born in Sonora, Mexico," Sapogonia 310]; or Alma Luz Villanueva s Rosa Luj?n, painter and teacher, whose best work of art is her child ["Both of us Yaqui. Then perhaps those genes will dominate," The Ultraviolet Sky 231-32]); or 2) claimed as a way of life (Alberto, in Alfredo Veas La Mara villa). 8 The liberal interpretation achieved its most influential reading in Daniel Cos?o Villegas s Historia moderna de M?xico (1955). Villegas proposed that Mexico's legacy of liberal democ racy, originating in the Wars of Independence, reached a culminating point in the Benito Ju?rez generation; the reactionary figures?such as Antonio L?pez de Santa Anna and Porfirio D?az?were a political aberration in Mexico's democratic tradition. In other words, Mexico's "liberal project" remains incomplete. For a counter-interpretation, see O'Gorman, I960, where the latter disagrees with Villegas's "Jaco bin" interpretation. 9This is a governing theme in many novels of the Mexican Revolution, beginning with Los de abajo (1915), by Mariano Azuela. Closer to Fontes's novel is, of course, La region m?s transparente (1958), by Carlos Fuentes; in this novel?which could be read as a sequel to Dreams of the Centaur?Fuentes also resurrects, as it were, Mexico's historical past?pre Columbian, Colonial, post-Independence, and modern?during another critical moment in Mexico's post-revolutionary history: the presi</page><page sequence="18">158 Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies Mart?nez, Eliud.
