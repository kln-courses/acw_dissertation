<plain_text><page sequence="1">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM Two of Kai Nielsen's recent books, Contemporary Critiques of Theism and Scepticism, present extensive criticisms of Christianity from an empiricist standpoint. Better than half of Contemporary Criti- ques of Theism is devoted to a development and defense of the "em- piricists' challenge" to the theist. This turns out to be a revised veri« fiability criterion which theological statements presumably fail to satisfy. In Scepticism, Nielsen attempts to build an argument for being skeptical of claims that theological statements have truth- value. Al- though Nielsen claims that his argument in Scepticism is not depen- dent on the arguments of Contemporary Critiques of Theism, I will show that his sceptical principle and some arguments in support of key premises in his main argument in Scepticism depend on accepting his verifiability criterion. Then I will consider the acceptability of the verifiability criterion on which so much of these two books rests. I A Nielsen is aware of the unhappy history of attempts to state an acceptable verifiability criterion. But he thinks that most philosophers have given up on this project too soon. Past mistakes have enabled latter day verificationists to see how some of the original ambitions and conceptions of the Logical Positivists must be scaled down or modified. Now we are in a good position to learn from past mistakes and formulate a defensible criterion which does its job. According to Nielsen, the original positivists went wrong in two ways which are relevant to our present concerns. First, they wrongly equated cognitive meaningfulness with verifiability and were thus led to declare that all unverifiable utterances were meaningless. Nielsen offers us some imperative sentences as counterexamples to this claim, and goes on to insist that meaning is distinct from and prior to veri-</page><page sequence="2">2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION fication ([2] pp. 32-33) .* Their second mistake, Nielsen thinks, was the Positivists' insistence that what satisfied their criterion must be conclusively verified or falsified. This was wrong because it was too strong a requirement, as subsequent conuterexamples showed. Since the "empiricists' challenge" to the theist is to ask him to show how his claims about God satisfy the verifiability criterion, Nielsen attempts to reinstate this challenge by rehabilitating the verifiability criterion. This rehabilitation is to be accomplished by avoiding the "mistakes" which Nielsen has pointed out. First, instead of taking the verifiability criterion to be a criterion of cognitive meaningfulness, he takes it to be a criterion of "factual significance," where this is often equated with "having a truth-value." Whereas sentences are meaningful and meaningless, statements can be factual (i.e. true) , or non-factual (i.e. false) . Statements are the units to be evaluated, and they are to be distinguished from sentences. The verifiability criterion is now designed to enable us to tell whether a sentence expresses a factually significant statement or not. Second, instead of requiring that verification or falsification be conclusive, Nielsen wants only to require that a genuine factually significant statement be in principle confirmable or "infirmable" by experience. Nielsen's revised, properly formulated, verifiability criterion goes like this: a statement would never unequivocally count as a factual state- ment unless it were at least in principle confirmable or infir- mable, i.e., unless at least some conceivable, empirically deter- minable state of affairs would count against its truth and some at least conceivable empirically determinable state of affairs would count for its truth. ([21, p. 57) Nielsen's "empiricist's challenge" to the theist is to show how the religious claims the theist makes can satisfy this criterion, and thus be worthy to be called "factually significant." B Turning now to Nielsen's book Scepticism, which is a sequel to Con- temporary Critiques of Religion, I will argue that the acceptability of 1 It is not likely that a good Logical Positivist would be much impressed by these "counterexamples" since the Positivists were only interested in declarative or indicative sentences.</page><page sequence="3">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 3 his main argument in the former book depends on the acceptability of the verifiability criterion, the "empiricist's challenge," of the latter. Nielsen's criticism of theism in Scepticism can be best viewed as the presentation of a skeptical argument, whose premises are defended throughout the book. Nielsen notes at the outset that he does not hold a general philosophical skepticism; it is a restricted skepticism, confined to theistic regious claims. I take the main argument of the book to be the following: 1. If a proposition p is alleged to have a truth-value but we can never find out what that truth-value is, then (a) there is some justification for holding that it is without value as a truth-claim and (b) we have good reason for being sceptical of its being a genuine truth-claim. ([3], p. 10) 2. Religious statements are (or should be) alleged to have a truth-value (in the same way as other statements) . 3. We can never find out what the truth-value of a religious state- ment is, unless it is construed anthropomorphically. 4. But religious statements should not be construed anthropo- morphically (by a sophisticated traditional theist) . 5. .'. We can never find out what the truth-value of a religious statement is. 6. •'. (a) There is some justification for holding that religious statements are without value as truth-claims, (b) We have good reason for being sceptical of religious statements' being genuine truth-claims. Nielsen devotes most of the book to establishing these premises, either by attempting to argue for them, by illustrating them, or at- tempting to refute various individuals who have denied them. For example, he spends the major portion of Chapter 2 attacking the posi- tion of D. Z. Phillips and Paul Holmer whom he takes as represen- tatives of "Wittgensteinian Fideism." They hold that religion is a "form of life" with its own criteria for rationality, intelligibility, and truth, and that to try to apply scientific or philosophical standards is a mistake. Religious statements don't have truth-value in the same way as other kinds of statements, according to them. Nielsen attacks this at some length. But the major part of the book is devoted to de- fending premises (3), (4), and (5). After arguing that anthropo- morphic conceptions of God are inadequate for "sophisticated tradi- tional theism," he attacks some efforts on the part of theists to say what they take as confirming or disconfirming their claims about God.</page><page sequence="4">4 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION He presents several arguments to the effect that the non-anthropo- morphic conception of God is such that there not only is not, but there could not be, any evidence confirming or disconfirming typical theological claims. Therefore, he says, such claims are "incoherent." How does Nielsen's argument depend on the acceptability of the verifiability criterion? Let us look more closely at the first premise, which is a statement of the principle around which the argument is constructed, focusing especially on the import of the clause, "but we can never find out what its truth-value is." On a certain, but perhaps naive, reading of this principle, it seems obviously false. There are events that may have transpired in the past, for which there is no longer any available evidence that they did or did not happen. But it doesn't seem at all plausible to conclude that we're justified in taking the claim, say, that in his last dream just before he died Napoleon dreamed that he defeated Wellington at Waterloo, to be without value as a truth-claim, i.e. lacking any truth-value. This is not intended as a counterexample to Nielsen's principle; it is designed to show that the principle, and, in particular, the clause I have singled out, needs to be clarified and understood properly before the import of the prin- ciple can be known. The "we" does not refer just to presently exist- ing persons, it also refers to persons who have existed in the past. But Nielsen also allows future happenings to count as potential evid- ence. Thus I think it quite clear that evidence needn't be evidence that was, is, or will be known by some human being. It simply has to be available at some time, past, present, or future, whether or not any person actually avails himself of it. Furthermore, when he is using his principle to argue against Hugo Meynell, Nielsen indicates that the evidence need not be conclusive; it only has to confirm or disconfirm the claim in question ([3], p. 13). Finally, Nielsen holds that the evidence we would need in order to find out the truth-value of the claim in question must be empirical, or at least it must be specified in "purely empirical" terms. Leaving aside questions which one could raise about what consti- tutes a "purely empirical" term, we can now give some answer to the question we asked earlier: What does it mean to say that we can never find out what the truth-value of some putative statement is? It means that there is no possible experience anyone could have which, when described in purely empirical terms, would confirm or disconfirm that statement. If we turn back to the statement of the verifiability criter- ion which I quoted earlier (p. 3), we can now see that the clause we</page><page sequence="5">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 5 have been examining from the skeptical principle amounts to saying that the statement in question flunks the verifiability criterion. In other words, the skeptical principle comes to this: If a statement is supposed to have a truth-value but it flunks the verifiability criterion, then we are justified in doubting that it has a truth-value. Therefore the success of skeptical arguments in Scepticism depends on the suc- cess of the verifiability criterion. Nielsen also implicitly relies on the verifiability criterion in some arguments for the incoherence of the concept of God in Scepticism. His arguments are designed to rebut attempts to cite alleged experien- ces of the presence of God as empirical evidence for certain claims about God. The concept of God is incoherent not because it is self- contradictory but because it is unintelligible - empirically unintel- ligible. The concept of God which Nielsen thinks incoherent is a non- anthropomorphic one,2 which he says is the one held by "sophisticated traditional theists." The components of this concept of God relevant to Nielsen's argument are such characteristics as God's being un- available to the human senses (e.g. His invisibility) , His not being a physical process, and His transcendence. Statements about such a God simply cannot be checked up on, according to Nielsen, and so have lost touch with truth and falsity. Since my purpose here is only to show the dependence of Nielsen's arguments on his verifiability criterion, I shall only sketch them roughly. (A) God is supposed to be a transcendent reality. Such a reality is not one that could be seen, heard, felt, etc. But the word 'experienced' and its determinates, such as, 'seen', 'heard', etc., "cannot be literally used when a non-anthropomorphic God is the subject." Therefore, "...talk of 'the experience of God,' ...is without truth-value" ([3], p. 47) (B) Empirical realities are determinate reali- ties and such realities are limited. God is unlimited reality. Determin- ate realities can in principle be experienced, but unlimited transcen- dent reality cannot. This argument is completed by adding the same final premise as (A) , and also concludes that talk of the experience of God is without truth-value. 2 Exactly what Nielsen thinks this is, will have to be a story for another time. Roughly, he thinks it is a concept of God according to which God has no properties which human beings or physical objects have. Whether many theists, especially Christian theists, have held this view is also another story.</page><page sequence="6">6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Given the way the arguments proceed, the conclusion is rather sur- prising. One might have expected Nielsen to conclude that literal statements about experiencing God were self-contradictory, just as statements about seeing something that is invisible would be self-con- tradictory. Instead, Nielsen declares that these statements are without truth-value, apparently deriving this from the claim that God cannot be experienced. What is the connection between being able to exper- ience something and being able to make true and false statements about it? We get the answer a bit later in the paragraph: "...if a statement has a truth-value it must be at least logically possible to find out what its truth-value is" ([3], p. 47). The context makes it clear that to find out what the truth-value of a statement is, one would have to find some determinate, empirical state of affairs which would at least con- firm or disconfirm the statement in question. Thus at the heart of these arguments, too, we find Nielsen's revised verifiability criterion. Therefore the "empiricist's challenge" to the theist and Nielsen's argument for skepticism about whether religious claims have a truth value depend on the revised verifiability criterion presented in [21. Does this criterion fare any better than did its forebears? This is the question I will consider next. II Nielsen aims to present a version of the verifiability criterion whir1 does not make any of the mistakes he claimed to find in the Logical Positivists, which avoids the problems encountered by previous ver- sions of the criterion, and which will show that religious statements are not factually significant. Apparently he is nettled by Plantinga's inability in God and Other Minds to see exactly what the verifica- tionists' challenge to the theist was. Plantinga complained that it was hard to see how verificationists could chide theologians (and theists generally) for ignoring the verifiability criterion, since no one had produced a satisfactory version of it. Nielsen presents us with a ver- sion which he says is satisfactory and therefore validates the challenge made by Flew in the University symposium. Here is his criterion, first as it applies to religious statements, and then as it applies to state- ments in general:</page><page sequence="7">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 7 Religious propositions purporting to make factual assertions must at least be confirmable or infirmable in principle by non-religious, straightforwardly empirical, factual statements. The operational principle here is that a statement would never count as a factual statement unless it were at least in principle confirmable or in- firmable, i.e., unless at least some conceivable, empirically deter- minate state of affairs would count against its truth and some at least conceivable, empirically determinable state of affairs would count for its truth. ([2], pp. 56-57) Now, he announces with an air of triumph, Flew's challenge is clear and must be met by the theist. But is this version of the criterion as clear as Nielsen apparently thinks? For example, is it meant to apply to analytic statements? Pro- bably not, since verificationists traditionally have treated these as separate and unproblematic in their attempts to state a verifiability criterion. Is the condition he gives intended as sufficient as well as necessary for "factual significance"? Though it appears not to be in the statement of the criterion, Nielsen usually treats it as though it is.3 So, briefly put, the criterion apparently goes like this: A statement is factually significant iff either it is analytically true or analytically false, or it is "at least in principle confirm- able or infirmable . . .." Perhaps this is a bit clearer, but we should notice that the dots con- ceal a discrepancy. Whereas Nielsen says "confirmable or infirmable" (my italics) in his statement of the criterion, he follows this in his clarificatory restatement by "at least some... state of affairs would count against its truth and some., state of affairs would count for its truth" (my italics) . Which does he mean? There is ample evidence in the book to indicate that he intends the conjunctive version, par- ticularly when he is quite explicit about what it would take to show that a theological statement is factually significant. (E.g., [2], pp. 57- 60.) On the other hand, most of his statements of the criterion have it in the disjunctive form. We must therefore examine both versions. The above by no means exhaust the important unclarities lurking in Nielsen's attempt to state the verifiability criterion. One of the most serious is the lack of any explanation of confirmation, particularly in 3 E.g., [2], p. 40. We should note that so far as Nielsen's argument against the theist is concerned, he needs only a necessary condition.</page><page sequence="8">8 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION view of the paradoxes and disputes presently surrounding this notion. The best we ever get by way of explanation is the use of "counts for" as an apparent synonym for "confirms." But there are different explanations of this relation of confirmation, and it makes a differ- ence which one we adopt. Nielsen fails to tell us which view he adopts. Is confirmation an objective relation or a subjective one? Does confirmation obey the probability calculus? We are not told. Still another sort of unclarity can be seen by re-reading Nielsen's account of the criterion with this question in mind: What sorts of things stand in this relationship of confirmation? We get several dif- ferent answers: statements confirm statements, conceivable states of affairs confirm statements, and observations and experiences confirm statements. Nielsen never stops to clear this up, though he appears to favor the latter answers. Thus we get no clear picture of what this crucial relationship is and what sorts of things it is supposed to relate. These defects are serious because the verifiability criterion, if it is to serve as a "litmus paper" test of factual significance, must be a test we are capable of applying - one which will tell us, especially in borderline cases, whether a given sentence expresses a factually significant statement or not. Given the fact that Nielsen's statement of his verifiability criterion is so unclear, it may seem impossible to show that it fails or succeeds. He gives us help, though, in the form of a challenge which indicates what he would accept as a counterexample: I challenge Plantinga or anyone else to provide a single counter- example of a statement not so confirmable or infirmable which is unequivocally taken to be a factual statement by a fair sample of native and fluent speakers of the language in which the state- ment is expressed. ([2] p. 58) Even if we are not sufficiently clear about the criterion so as to be able to tell which statements pass and which fail, we do have numer- ous examples given by Nielsen himself of sentences which do not ex- press factually significant statements. Thus if we take this proposal of his seriously, we can begin by asking some "native and fluent" spea- kers of English whether the sentences he uses as examples express something which is true or false, i.e. which is factually significant. Now Nielsen thinks that sentences about God are paradigm cases of sentences that fail to pass muster, given his criterion. But it seems pretty obvious that "a fair sample of native and fluent speakers" of</page><page sequence="9">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 9 English would take "God exists" or "there is a God" to express some- thing that has a truth value. They may disagree about what truth- value it has, or they may claim not to know what truth value it has, but they would agree that it has a truth value. Indeed it seems very likely that "There is a God" would fare better in such a sample than "There are photons," which Nielsen thinks is clearly factually signi- ficant. So either we should not take Nielsen's own proposed test very seriously or else his criterion fails to eliminate some of the very statements it was designed to eliminate. To see which conclusion we should draw and whether we should accept this criterion, we must look at it more closely. Suppose, for the purpose of this inquiry, that we have a reasonably clear idea of what confirmation amounts to. Suppose that we can tell when some- thing confirms something else and when something disconfirms some- thing else. Let us further assume that this relationship is objective rather than subjective. Even with these assumptions, we still cannot give a single formula- tion of Nielsen's criterion. We have to decide what sort of thing is supposed to confirm or disconfirm a sentence if that sentence is to count on making a factually significant statement. And we must know whether that sentence must be confirmable or disconfirmable or whether it must be confirmable and disconfirmable. I shall consider the conjunctive versions first. The general conjunc- tive form is: VC I. A sentence, S, expresses a factually significant statement iff there is a which confirms £ and there is a which disconfirms S. We obtain the various versions by filling the blanks with the various things Nielsen cites as confirming the statement being examined. The candidates are a. Statements which describe empirically determinable states of affairs b. Possible experiences c. Conceivable empirically determinate states of affairs. No matter which conjunctive version Nielsen chooses, there are coun- terexamples: 1. Something (contingent) exists 2. There has existed at least one human person 3. There are experiences</page><page sequence="10">10 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 4. There are some empirically determinate states of affairs. As far as I can see, there are no statements which describe empiric- ally determinate states of affairs, no possible experiences (human sensory experiences) , and no conceivable empirically determinate state of affairs which would disconfirm these statements. Yet they are clearly factually significant; in fact we all know them to be true. The denials of these statements are also factually significant, and it is equally easy to see they are not confirmable in the prescribed ways. Therefore the conjunctive form of Nielsen's Verifiability Criterion fails. But perhaps that conjunctive form of the criterion is no more than a slip of Nielsen's pen. The proper formulation, he might say, is the disjunctive one: VC II. A sentence S expresses a factually significant statement iff either there is a which confirms S or there is a. which disconfirms S. Again we have the above-mentioned options for filling the blanks. This time we only need find something which confirms our candidate or something which disconfirms it; we need not satisfy both require- ments. This more liberal statement of the verifiability criterion nicely accommodates my counterexamples to the conjunctive version. Is some version of the above formulation the one which will do the job for Nielsen? In [5], R. G. Swinburne gives several alleged counterexamples to a principle almost identical with VC II. His primary counterexample is this: Among possible claims about the prehuman past which the best evidence ever to be obtained by man makes highly improbable some are nevertheless true. ([5], p. 74) This is supposed to be a statement which is neither confirmable nor disconfirmable but certainly is factually meaningful. I think Swinburne's statement is not a counterexample because it is confirmable. There are at least two ways it might be confirmed. First, suppose that there was a general pattern such that very many claims about the prehuman past which the best evidence we ever thought we would get rendered highly improbable nevertheless turned out to be true after we obtained further evidence. Would not such a pattern confirm, to some degree, Swinburne's statement? Second, sup-</page><page sequence="11">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 1 1 pose we have a series of possible and related claims about some sub- ject, say dinosaurs, in the prehuman past. Suppose that each claim is highly improbable on the best evidence man will ever obtain. They might be a series of statements like this: (1) Exactly one dinosaur existed in North America before men appeared in history; (2) Exact- ly two dinosaurs . . .; and so on, let us say, up to a trillion. Now con- sider the disjunction of these trillion statements. Though each dis- junct is highly improbable on our best evidence, surely the disjunction is virtually certain to be true. Since the disjuncts are mutually exclu sive, one of them is true. But then we have confirmed the statement Swinburne proposes as a counterexample. Swinburne presents some other counterexamples patterned after this one. I think that they can be dealt with in similar ways, and so I conclude that Swinburne has not provided a decisive counterexample to Nielsen's criterion nor to the "confirmationist principle" Swinburne was discussing. If we lack a decisive counterexample to this verifiability criterion, are there other ways to attack it? One obvious way is to show that it fails to yield the results which its devotees want and expect. Nielsen clearly wants and expects his criterion to rule out theological and religious statements. But it fails to do this. This fact was pointed out by Keith Yandell in a response to Niel- sen at an American Philosophical Association Symposium held in 1968. Yandell offered the following example: Suppose we knew the following propositions to be true; a. every sentient creature has, for every moment of his existence, been in such pain that were he to have felt more pain he would have lost consciousness; b. this wretched condition is caused by biological features essen- tial to the species; c. suicide is impossible and so is cessation of procreation, so that future generations will exist under the same conditions; d. insofar as moral life is possible under these circumstances, men rise above the level of imbecility only to record and roundly curse their plight with the exception that, e. insofar as moral life is possible under these circumstances, each man's deepest wish is to increase the sufferings of every other if this were possible. Now surely if our world were like this (and given that we could raise the question), we would have good reason to deny that</page><page sequence="12">12 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION God loves us - as good as we have, say, that cigarette smoking disposes to lung cancer. At the very minimum, surely we would have some evidence that God does not love us. ([6]; p. 242) It is quite clear from Yandell's example that ''God loves us" is dis- confirmable in principle and so does not fail Nielsen's criterion. Nielsen takes this seriously as a possibility but tries to dismiss it. He admits that "...there are some employments of 'God governs the world' and the like where it does function as a meaningful empirical statement quite open to confirmation or disconfirmation" ([2], pp. 60-61). He imagines a theist admitting that empirical evidence can count for and against his claims but then also maintaining that he does not hold these claims because he is so overwhelmed by the evid- ence in their favor but because he has in faith committed himself to their truth. He so commits himself because this faith satisfies deep human needs of his which are not satisfied any other way, and he thinks this is a reasonable course of action. This bothers Nielsen, and so rather than admit that such a theist is making verifiable, meaning- ful claims, he says that there is an "important sense" in which such a fideistic theist has still failed to meet the verificationist's challenge. He puts it like this: The believer must in princple at least be able to show what em- prical states of affairs (what differential experience) would count as evidence for his statement that would not be equally compa- tible with the contradictory of his statement. ([2], p. 64) Just when the theist may have thought he was out of the metaphysical woods and on the open plains of the verifiable, Nielsen claims he is still trapped in a thicket. What exactly is Nielsen demanding of the theist here? Evidence in favor of the theist's claims which is not compatible with the contra- dictories of those claims? But this is equivalent to demanding of the possible evidence for theistic statements that it entail those statements. And so Nielsen's "important sense" of the verificationist's challenge which the sophisticated theist fails to meet turns out to be one of the earlier versions of the verifiability criterion which Nielsen explicitly disavowed (for good reason) earlier in his book. Thus this way of answering Yandell's proof that "God loves us" is verifiable is not an especially wise choice for Nielsen. His zeal to refute the theist has led him back into an old error.</page><page sequence="13">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 13 So far we have seen that Nielsen has not provided the theist with any reason to suppose that his statements about God are not factually significant, according to this criterion of factual significance. The veri- ficationist's challenge can be met relatively easily. But there is another way of apparently meeting the challenge which is broader, easier, and which points to deeper difficulties with the whole enterprise of trying to give and use a verifiability criterion. Let p be a sentence which expresses Nielsen's favorite confirmable statement, and let q be any old declarative sentence. Let us suppose that q is meaningful 4 and expresses something independent of p. Now consider the conjunction of the denial of p with q. This, it would seem, is disconfirmed by p, which by hypothesis is factually significant. Hence, by Nielsen's criterion (~ p&amp;.q) expresses a factually signifi- cant statement. By a familiar law of logic, (~ p&amp;q) entails that q, and since whatever is entailed by a factually significant statement is itself factually significant, we may now conclude that q expresses a factually significant statement. Obviously if this argument is correct, it would show that Nielsen's criterion is vastly more liberal than he intended. This criterion could be used to show that virtually any declarative sentence expresses a factually significant statement. The only way to eliminate a sentence from consideration will be to declare that it is meaningless. How might a Nielsenian verificationist object to this argument? It seems hard for him to deny that ( ~ p&amp;g) is factually significant. It will be disconfirmed by whatever confirms p, and hence satisfies his verifiability criterion. Perhaps he would like to introduce some special rules for conjunctions. He might be tempted to claim that some evidence disconfirms a conjunction only if it disconfirms each conjunct, but a little reflection will show that this is false. Or he might declare that a sentence that expresses a conjunction expresses something factually significant only if each conjunct can be shown to be factually significant independently of the others. This suggestion is also unpromising, for it would mean that the verifiability criterion has to apply only to atomic or simple sentences. But then we need a way of telling when a sentence is simple or atomic. The difficulties involved in trying to provide a way of telling this are notorious, no one has yet provided a way which is effective and non-arbitrary. Be- 4 Note that we are entitled to assume this without begging any questions, since Nielsen has insisted that "meaning is logically prior to and distinct from verification../' ([2], p. 33).</page><page sequence="14">14 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION sides, Nielsen himself has suggested that he does not want to consider sentences atomistically in applying the verifiability criterion when he warns, "Remember, as we have learned from Duhem and Quine, we should not take statements in isolation when considering their confir- mability and infirmability" ([2], p. 64) . Nevertheless, this sentence q, which I argue can be shown to be factually significant on Nielsen's criterion, still appears to have been smuggled in and shown to be factually significant in a way that has nothing to do with q. The verificationist might object that when I claim in any argument that p disconfirms (~ pScq) and that (~p&amp;.q)-^&gt;q, I am really guilty of begging the question against him. For in making such claims, he might say, I am assuming, or better, presupposing that this sentence q enters into logical relationships. But a sentence can enter into logical relationships only if it has a truth- value - i.e., only if it is factually significant. Thus my using as pre- mises that (~p&amp;.q)-^&gt;q and p disconfirms (~p&amp;.q) is tantamount to to assuming the conclusion of my argument. These relationships can only hold between factually significant statements. If this is a valid objection on the part of the verificationist, then his criterion is of no help in determining factual significance. If one can- not tell whether one sentence confirms or disconfirms another with- out already knowing or presupposing that these sentences express fac- tually significant statements, then no one will be able to use the criterion without begging the question. We would have to know the results in advance of applying the test. So the verificationist cannot accuse me of begging the question without making his own use of confirmation and disconfirmation question begging. This renders the criterion quite useless to both of us in determining whether or not a sentence expresses a factually significant statement. Furthermore, if it were true that only sentences expressing genuine statements stand in confirmation and disconfirmation relations, we could have an even simpler criterion - we could say that a sentence expresses a factually significant statement iff it confirms itself.5 There is one remaining premise in my argument. Could the Niel- senian verificationist reasonably deny that if a sentence is factually significant then whatever is entailed by it is also factually significant? No, for the denial of this is incompatible with Nielsen's verifiability 5 Similar points are argued for with respect to using entailment rather than confirmation as the relationship genuine statements must bear to "observables" by Stich, Tinnon, and Sklar in [4].</page><page sequence="15">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 15 criterion. Suppose that the verificationist denies this principle. He then holds that it is possible to have some sentence, r, for example, which expresses something factually significant, and r - &gt; s, but it is false that s expresses something factually significant. But surely if r - &gt; s, then r confirms s, and hence s is confirmable. But if s is confirmable, then by the VC, s expresses something factually significant. Hence our assumptions imply a contradiction. Thus if the VC is correct, so is this premise in my argument. My little argument seems to stand, then, and it completely draws the polemical teeth of the disjunctive form of Nielsen's VC. It elimin- ates any reason to be interested in such a verifi ability criterion. I have argued that all of Nielsen's formulations of his verifiability criterion are intolerably obscure and some are simply wrong. The first general formulation I considered, the conjunctive one, is simply wrong; it eliminates many factually significant statements. The second general formulation can be satisfied by theological statements. It also appears to have the consequence either that virtually any sentence expresses a factually significant statement or that the verifiability criterion fails to provide a test for factual significance which can be applied to sentences without our knowing in advance that they have truth value (more precisely, that they express a statement having a truth value) . It is interesting to note that Ayer, whom Nielsen claims to be follow- ing in his attempt to resuscitate verificationism, now accepts this latter objection, or something similar to it, as grounds for rejecting attempts to provide a verifiability criterion along the lines that Nielsen has pursued ([1], p. 30.). In any case, Nielsen's verifiability criterion fails to provide a theist with any reason to think he is talking nonsense when he talks about God. What Nielsen describes as "Flew's challenge" has yet to be vin- dicated. And we have as yet no reason to accept one of the crucial premises in Nielsen's argument for skepticism about theistic claims. Is there any hope for the verificationist's enterprise? I can see very little hope if it is pursued in the way Nielsen is trying to do it. He presents his project as one of trying to sort through indicative senten ces in order to determine which of them express genuine statements. To do this he needs a verifiability relationship which obtains exactly in those cases in which a sentence expresses a factually significant statement and which is such that it is possible to ascertain whether or not the relation obtains without knowing or presupposing that the sentence in question is factually significant. The relationship, there-</page><page sequence="16">16 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION fore, should not be one which presupposes that the things so related be factually significant. Otherwise the criterion will have no polemic- al force. So, what sort of relationship should the verificationist look to? Entailment? Stich, Tinnon, and Sklar argue persuasively in [4] that if entailment is taken to be a relation which holds only between statements which have truth values, the trivial criterion, p is entailed by 0 &amp; - »0, will be sufficient. Those who take this view ". . . need not be concerned with a definition of verifiability .... Their attention is better directed to formulating a definition of entailment in accord with the Hempel-Rynin premise and applicable to arbitrary sentences in an arbitrary language without consideration of whether these sen- tences are true or false." &amp; As they go on to note, "this is, in effect, to abandon verificationism." They explore this project in some detail but conclude that there is little hope for success. Should the verificationist try another relationship instead? We have just explored using confirmation or disconfirmation and have found that to be no more promising. Perhaps there are still some promising candidates waiting to be discovered and trotted out. But it seems prudent at this point not to make any extravagant claims on behalf of verificationism. Epilogue Those who have proposed verifiability criteria have typically held that certain kinds of claims lack any factual significance, especially theological and metaphysical claims. When a criterion was shown not to rule these out, usually that criterion was abandoned. Generally those who have proposed verifiability criteria, and Nielsen is no exception, have known in advance of formulating a criterion what should satisfy it and what should not. This prompts a question: How did they find this out? How did Nielsen find it out? They certainly did not discover it as a result of formulating a verifiability criterion and then carefully applying it. We still lack a criterion which effectively picks out all and only factually significant statements. How then does Nielsen know that theological statements are nonsense, or not 6 [4], p. 91. The Hempel-Rynin premise is the claim that the relation of logical deducibility can obtain only between sentences possessed of truth-values. (The sentence omitted from the quoted passage appears to be a misprint.)</page><page sequence="17">VERIFICATIONISM AND DOGMATISM 17 factually significant? Is this a generally self-evident truth? Surely not. The answer seems to be rather that Nielsen accepts this claim as a basic dogma. But then all of his frequent and strident complaints about the dogmatism of theologians and theists look like so many cases of the pot's calling the kettle black.
