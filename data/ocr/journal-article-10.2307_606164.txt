<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON EASTERN HANAFITE HERESIOGRAPHY KEITH LEWINSTEIN SMITH COLLEGE The heresiographical literature best known to Islamicists is largely the product of Muctazilite and Ash'arite scholars. This paper is a preliminary study of an alternative heresiographical tradition, produced and transmitted originally in eastern Hanafite circles. It includes an identification of some of the basic texts now available, a discussion of their distinctive literary features, and two brief case studies which directly compare eastern and standard material. It is suggested that in some cases the eastern literature offers a way behind the classical MuCtazilite-AshCarite tradition. STUDIES OF EARLY ISLAMIC DOCTRINES and sects have long taken as their starting point the Sunni heresiograph- ical literature. There is little else for scholars to work with. For the most part, the classical tradition has not al- lowed the earliest sectarians to speak for themselves, and historians have instead to rely on later heresiographical representations of them. This approach is not without its obvious drawbacks, and to these I wish to add one more: the domination of the field by Muctazilite and AshCarite heresiographical texts. It is this MuCtazilite-Ash'arite discourse that has found its way into academic footnotes through the well-known works of Ashcari (d. 324/935), Baghdadi (d. 429/1037), Shahrastani (d. 548/1153), and other medieval heresiographers.' While these books are themselves composite and preserve a number of earlier polemical agendas,2 they do not account for all the he- resiographical data produced by Muslim scholars. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to an indepen- dent yet often neglected tradition of firaq writing. One good place to start is with the Talbis Iblis, a well-known polemical tract composed by the Hanbalite scholar Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597/1200). The Talbis is not a strictly heresiographical work, but it does contain mate- rial of a schematic Cilm al-firaq type. The first of these sections to appear in the work is distinctive both in con- tent and structure, and does not seem to have passed through the usual Muctazilite and/or Ashcarite hands.3 1 G.

More conventional heresiography can be found elsewhere in the text. The framework employed by Ibn al-Jawzi, as well as the names and doctrines he assigns individual sects, are at odds with what is offered in more standard works. Pro- fessor Laoust, who nearly twenty-five years ago wrote the principal genre study of thefiraq literature, seems to have overlooked the book's singularity, and notes only that its organization seems "fort artificiel."4 Laoust is impressed mostly by Ibn al-Jawzi's Hanbalite credentials, and sees the Talbis as a work in the tradition of "Hanbalite" he- resiography.5 On closer inspection, however, it appears that the Talbis has very little in common withfiraq works composed by other Hanbalite or traditionalist authors. There are no parallels to be found in the most likely places; for instance, the schematic material preserved by the Hanbalite Sufi CAbd al-Qadir al-Jilani (d. 561/1166),6 the Burhan of the Shaficite (?) traditionalist CAbbas b. Manstir al-Saksaki (d. 683/1284),7 the Kitab al-Tanbih of the Syrian traditionalist Abu '1-Husain al-Malati 4 "L'heresiographie musulmane sous les Abbassides," Ca- hiers de civilisation medievale 10 (1967): 175. 5 Laoust is even clearer about this elsewhere; see La Profes- sion de foi d'lbn Batta (Damascus, 1958), 16 (translation), n. 2, where Ibn al-Jawzi's schematic approach is mistakenly linked with that of CAbd Allah b. al-Mubarak and Abu Bakr al- Ajurri. On these two see below, nn. 9 and 10. 6 Kitab al-Ghunya li-Talibi Tariq al-Haqq (Cairo, 1375 A.H.), 1:85, 11. 3-95, 1. 14, where the material is standard MuCtazilite-AshCarite. 7 Kitab al-Burhan fi Macrifat 'Aqadid Ahl al-Adyan (Arabic MS. Nuruosmaniye 4919, Istanbul). The copyist names the au- thor at the top of the text as Abu 'l-Fadl CAbbas b. Mansur b. CAbbas al-Saksaki al-Sunni al-Hanbali. But it is a Shaficite Saksaki who is named as the author of the Burhan in Hadiyyat al-'Arifin (Istanbul, 1951), 1:437, 11. 12-15.

What the Talbis preserves, in short, is clearly without a Hanbalite pedigree. If Ibn al-Jawzi does not quite fit where he should, there remains an alternative context in which he can be placed, namely, the Hanafite-Maturidite tradition of Transoxania. It is clear from what remains of this tradi- tion that the heresiographical format found in Ibn al- Jawzi was shaped and transmitted largely by Hanafite for him in either Subki or the Hanbalite tabaqat literature, and he does not appear in H. Halm, Die Ausbreitung der safi'iti- schen Rechtsschule von den Anfangen bis zum 8./14. Jahrhun- dert (Wiesbaden, 1974). The only source actually mentioned by Saksaki is the Kitdb al-Firaq of a certain Abu Muhammad, apparently composed during the Caliphate of al-Muqtafi (530-55/1135-60); see H. Ritter, "Philologika III: Mu- hammedanische Haresiographen," Der Islam 18 (1929): 47. At least some of Saksaki's material appears to be culled from the Fisal of Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1065). 8 Kitab al-Tanbih wa-'l-Radd Cald Ahl al-Ahwi' wa-'l-BidaC, ed. S. Dedering (Istanbul, 1936). The material toward the end of the text may be from the Kitdb al-Istiqama of the tradition- alist Abiu CAsim Khushaish (d. 253/867); no sources are men- tioned for the material found earlier in the work. For a description of the sources imbedded in the text, see R. Stroth- mann, "On the History of Islamic Heresiography," Islamic Culture 12 (1938): 5-16. 9 There is nothing relevant in his Ibdna 'l-Sughra, published by Laoust in La Profession de foi. In the Ibdna 'l-Kubra (=al- Ibdna Can Sharicat al-Firaq al-Ndjiya wa-Mujdnabat al-Firaq al-Madhmuma, 2 vols. [Riyad, 1988], 1:377-86), Ibn Batta re- fers to thefiraq schemata of Yusuf b. Asbat (d. after 190/806), CAbd Allah b. al-Mubarak (d. 181/797), and Abu Hatim Mu- hammad b. Idris al-Razi (d. 277/890). The last is transmitting from an anonymous source (Can ba'd ahl al-'ilm), whose ma- terial is close to what Malati may have from Khushaish (see previous note). Ibn al-Mubarak's schema was obviously popu- lar in Hanbalite circles; it is quoted in Barbahari's (d. 329/941) Sharh Kitdb al-Sunna (in Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqdt al-Handbila, 2 vols. [Beirut, n.d.], 2:40 11. 1 Iff.), and can also be found ap- pended to Dedering's edition of Malati's Tanbih (pp. 143-44). On this section of the Ibdna 'l-Kubrd, see van Ess, "Bibliogra- phische Notizen zur islamischen Theologie," Die Welt des Orients 11 (1980): 131. 10 See, for example, the author's extended discussion of the 73 sects tradition, where the specific framework offered is cited from Yfisuf b. Asbat (previous note) and in no way pre- figures Ibn al-Jawzi; Kitdb al-ShariCa (Cairo, 1369 A.H.), 14, 11. 14-20, 1. 18. scholars of a Maturidite tendency in theology, and in the fourth and fifth Islamic centuries this meant mostly the Hanafites of eastern Iran and Transoxania." As the doctrines of eastern Hanafism were systematized by scholars such as Abu Mansuir al-Maturidi (d. 333/944), an increased demand for heresiographical writing must have been felt. If eastern Hanafism was to establish it- self as a full-fledged orthodoxy, a suitable heterodoxy would have to be provided. Local Hanafite scholars thus turned their attention to heresiography, and gener- ated a tradition which would be preserved for centuries in the Middle East and India. The following discussion will begin with an attempt to identify a few of the principal works which make up this tradition, and to gather together some of the dispar- ate information available about these texts. In the second section, I will discuss some of the tradition's distinctive literary features, particularly those which set it apart from the standard MuCtazilite-Ash'arite firaq books. Fi- nally, I will offer two brief case studies comparing east- ern and standard material, in the hopes of demonstrating the gulf between the two traditions, as well as the poten- tial value of considering them together.12 * * * I. IDENTIFICATION Maturidi himself is sometimes credited with a sche- matic heresiography (Kitab al-Maqaldt),'3 although the 1 W.

Despite his promising nisba, the famous Hanafite heresiogra- pher Abu 'l-Qasim al-Balkhi (d. 319/931) is, like his theology, firmly in the Muctazilite tradition. The same is true of the eastern Iranian Hanafite Abu 'l-MaCali, whose Bayan al-Adyan (commonly considered the first Persian firaq work) is largely, though not entirely, standard. On this text see van Ess' article in the Encyclopedia Iranica ("Abu 'l-MaC'li Mohammad"); and Madelung, "Spread," 119, n. 31. 12 I have not considered the question of how this easternfiraq material is used theologically by different authors. That more properly belongs to a study of the varieties of eastern Hanafi thought. Here, I am principally interested in tracking the raw material which comprises this heresiographical tradition. 13 Hajji Khalifa, Kashf al-zunun (Istanbul, 1941), 1782, 1. 8; Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa', al-Jawdhir al-Mud'ia ft Tabaqdt al-Hanafiyya (Hyderabad, 1332 A.H.), 2:130, 1. 12; Ibn 584</page><page sequence="3">LEWINSTEIN: Notes on Eastern Hanafite Heresiography nature of the attributions does not inspire much confi- dence. The work is never, to my knowledge, cited or de- scribed.'4 The earliest reference to such a book appears to be in the Usul al-Din of the Maturidite theologian Abu 'l-Yusr al-Bazdawi (d. 493/1099). There is, how- ever, no reason to suppose that Bazdawi had actually seen the work; he is forced to fall back on Makhuil al- Nasafi's treatise (to be discussed below) when seeking to contrast Maturidite and Ashcarite heresiography.15 If the book did exist, it clearly had very little circulation. Al- ternatively, one could take the ascription to Maturidi of a firaq work as nothing more than a bid by later Mfturi- dite scholars to keep their master from being outdone by his more famous contemporary, Ashcari, himself the au- thor of an extremely well known Kitab al-Maqalat.16 Qutlubugha, Taj al-Tarajim (Die Krone der Lebensbeschreibun- gen), ed. G. Fligel (Leipzig, 1862), 43, 1. 27; Abu CUdhba, al-Rawda 'l-Bahiyya fi-md baina 'l-AshdCira wa-'l-Mituridiyya (Hyderabad, 1322/1924), 4,11.5-7. (and see M. T. Danishpazhuh, "Kitibshinasi-yi Firaq-o-Adyan," (Farhang-i Iran Zamin 12 [1964]: 114). 14 The Istanbul MS listed by Brockelman (GAL, 1:195) as pos- sibly the Maqaldt turns out to be a work on Ashcarite kaldm, and is in any case falsely ascribed to Maturidi; see M. Gotz, "Mfituridi und sein Kitfib Ta'wilat al-Qur'an," Der Islam 41 (1965): 29, n. 12; Muhammad b. Tavit at-Tanci, "Abu Mansir al-Mafturidi," Ankara Ildhiyat Fakiiltesi Dergisi 1-2 (1955): 8, n. 5. (I owe these references to Aron Zysow.) The list of Matu- ridi's writings given by Abu 'l-MuCin al-Nasafi (d. 508/1114) may, but does not necessarily, imply the concrete existence of the work (wa-man raad tasdnifahu ka-Kitdb al-Tawhid wa-Kitdb al-Maqaldt....; extracts from Nasafi's Tabsirat al- Adilla published in Tanci, AIFD, 1-2:8). The wording is mildly suggestive, but there is nothing conclusive about it, and Nasafi (along with the rest of the Hanafi tradition) neglects to provide even a single quotation from the book. It is worth noting that Nasafi's listing bears a strong resemblance to the lists of Maitu- ridi's works offered elsewhere in the Hanafi tradition (see, for example, the Hanafi literature cited in note 13, above, where the Tawhid, Maqaldt, and Radd Awa'il al-Adilla always appear to- gether at the top of the list). If Nasafi is simply presenting what he knew to be Mfturidi's standard c.v., the passage here is not especially strong evidence for the Maqdalt's existence. 15 Usul al-Din, ed. H. P. Linss (Cairo, 1383/1963), 241, 11. 6ff.; and see Qannawji, Bahr al-Madhdhib, Berlin MS. Ahl- wardt 1851 (Spr. 706), fol. 191a, 11. 1-2. Bazdawi also knows of other works following Nasafi's arrangement (wa-li-ghair Makhul aidan tasaniffi hddhd), but has nothing specific to say about Maturidi's approach. 16 Maqalat al-lsldmiyyin wa-'khtildf al-Musallin, ed. H. Rit- ter, 3 vols. (Istanbul, 1929-33). This suspicion is strengthened The earliest surviving work in the eastern tradition was produced by a slightly older contemporary of Ma- turidi, the eastern Hanafite scholar Abu Mutic Makhul b. al-Fadl al-Nasafi (d. 318/930).17 The content of Na- safi's Kitab al-Radd 'ald 'l-BidaC is yet to be system- atically studied by Islamicists. Massignon recognized its importance, but was concerned first of all with the author's Sifi and Karramite connections.18 Van Ess went on to do the basic groundwork and gather the available biographical information on Nasafi in his study of the sources relating to the Karramiyya.19 An edition of the text itself was published in 1980 by Ber- nand, who clearly saw its value as a counterweight to the Ashcarite books which have always dominated the field.20 Several references in the book to Abui Hanifa estab- lish the broad Hanafite identity of the author.21 This is also seen in his frequent reference to one Hanafite- Murji'ite definition of faith-belief subsists in word, and deeds are merely its practice (al-iman qawl wa-'l- Camal shardaiCuhu).22 The work's decidedly eastern by the fact that Bazdawi and Qannawji (above, n. 15) refer to Maturidi's Kitdb al-Maqaldt in the same breath as the more fa- mous maqaldt works of AshCari and Abi 'l-Qasim al-KaCbi (= al-Balkhi). It should be noted that far less work has been done on Mfturidite than on Ashcarite thought. The fact that I have not yet seen citations from Maturidi's Maqaldt is, of course, no guarantee that they are not to be found somewhere. 17 GAL, SI:358; GAS, 1:601-2; Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa', Jawahir, 2:180. The two entries here for Makhil al-Nasafi (nos. 552 and 553) are the result of a confusion; see J. van Ess, Un- genutzte Texte zur Karramiya: Eine Materialsammlung, Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissen- schaften, phil.-hist.

Nasafi is also said to have written a Sufi work (GAL, SI:358 [Kitab fi 'l-Tasawwuf]; GAS, 1:602 [Kitab al-Lu'lu'iyydt, on which see Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa', Jawdhir, 2:180, 1. 8]).

Nasafi sometimes refers also to knowledge (macrifa) and internal conviction (tasdiq), formulations which are more common in Hanafite-Murji&gt;ite circles; Nasafi, Radd, 62, 11. 17-18; see Abui Hanifa, Kitab al-'Alim wa-'l-MutaCallim (Aleppo, 1972), 585</page><page sequence="4">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) Hanafite literary context is apparent first of all in Nas- afi's opening statement upholding personal investiga- tion (nazar) against reliance on taqlid: the language and content of the passage echo the opening lines of Maturidi's Kitab al-Tawhid.23 Moreover, the nature of the author's anti-MuCtazilite theology fits well with the eastern Hanafite thought known from later centuries.24 And finally, Nasafi is clearly better informed than the standard heresiographers on specifically eastern theo- logical questions. For example, he and his eastern col- leagues regularly speak of a certain Mafrughiyya sect, unknown to the standard writers but associated in Maturidite theological works with arguments concern- ing the uncreatedness of imdn.25 52, 11.

For the Hanafite character of Nasafi's language, see Ibn Hazm, al-Fisalfi 'I-Milal wa-'l-Ahwd' wa-'l- Nihal, 5 vols. (Cairo, n.d.), 2:106, 1. 10. The formulation was first circulated as a prophetic hadith, according to Dhahabi, by Ma'mun b. Ahmad al-Sulami (fl. 255) (Mizan al-lItidal fi Naqd al-Rijdl [Cairo, 1382/1963], 3:429, 11. 16-18; cited by van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 49, n. 205). This same Ma'mun is also said by Dhahabi to have spread a (pro-Hanafite) hadith condemning the raising of one's hands in prayer after the first alldhu akbar. The limitation of raf to the initial takbir is said by Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa' to have been upheld by Nasafi in his Kitab al-Shucad (Jawdhir, 2:180, 1. 4). This doctrine was a point of occasionally violent dispute between the Hanafites and other Sunni schools; see Shaibani, Kitdb al-Athdr (Hyderabad, 1385/1965), 1:126, 11. 2-4 (and n. 4); Madelung, "Spread," 125, n. 39; van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 57; and M.

The group is mentioned by Abu 'l-MuCin al-Nasafi in his Bahr al-Kaldm, tr. A. Jeffery, A Reader on Islam (The Hague, 1962), 379-80. The uncreatedness of faith was, according to Bazdawi, upheld by the scholars of Bukhara and Farghana, while the scholars of Samarqand insisted that imdn was created and considered anyone thinking otherwise an ignoramous (jahhali man qala innahu ghair makhluq) (Usul al-Din, 154, 11. 13-156, 1. 10; cited in Madelung, "Spread," 118, n. 30; and see Abu CUdhba, Rawda, 71, 11. 13f., where, however, the term "Mafrughiyya" is absent). Might the sect's laqab, incidentally, have origi- nated as a punning reference to Farghana? Nasafi offers no Nasafi's Hanafite and Suifi associations probably brought him into contact with the local Karramiyya, a group whose membership spilled over into such cir- cles.26 Some features of this text have been seen by van Ess as indicative of such connections. For example, Nasafi neglects to mention the Karramiyya among the seventy-two heterodox firaq (a surprising fact, given the contemporary importance of the group in the East);27 two early Karramite personalities figure as au- thorities for Nasafi;28 and finally, the author's professed hostility to those who strive after material comforts ac- cords well with the Karramiyya's famous tahrim al- makdsib.29 A Karramite heresiography would certainly be welcome; whether Nasafi's Radd is any such thing is, however, far from proven.30 In her introduction to the Nasafi text, Bernand notes certain similarities between this work and a Hanafite- Maturidite heresiography published in Ankara two de- cades earlier, the Kitdb al-Firaq al-Muftariqa baina Ahl al-Zaigh wa-'l-Zandaqa (FM). The author is Abu Mu- hammad cUthman b. CAbd Allah al-CIraqi al-Hanafi.31 Nothing is known of this cUthman al-Hanafi, but the work can be dated on internal grounds to about the year explicit explanation of the name, and the one implicit in his use of the rootf-r-gh is unconvincing. 26 For the problematic relationship between the eastern Ha- nafites and the Karramiyya, see A. Zysow, "Two Unrecog- nized Karrami Texts," Journal of the American Oriental Society 108 (1988): 583-87. See also W. Madelung, Religious Trends in Early Islamic Iran (Albany, N.Y., 1988), 40. 27 Van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 58. 28 cUthman b.

For the probable Karramite identity of both, see van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 58. I would add that the statement quoted from the former may have been taken from a heresiographical context; CUthman b. CAffan al-Sijzi is said to have held the question of imdn to be central to the communi- ty's division into seventy-three sects. Given the importance of imdn throughout Nasafi's own presentation, it is tempting to see Karramite fingerprints on the text. 29 Nasafi, 94, 11. 13-15. See Madelung, Trends, 39. 30 Van Ess himself is equivocal (Ungeniitzte Texte, 58, 60), and Zysow calls the Karramite provenance of the text "highly doubtful" ("Texts," 577, n. 3). 31 Ed.

An isnad given early on runs through two Turks,33 and the editor supposes cUthman b. CAbd Allah himself to have been a non-Arab.34 Given the author's nisba (al-Hanafi) and the well-known doctrinal alle- giances of the Turks,35 we can assume him to have figured in Hanafite-Maturidite intellectual circles. This initial impression is confirmed not only by his repeated references to Abui Hanifa (twice as al-imam al-aCzam, after the Hanafite fashion),36 but by the doctrinal stance apparent in his opening precis of the ahl al-sunna wa-'l- jamdaa.37 Finally, the author's favorable mention of Abu Yazid al-Bistami (d. 261/874) is suggestive of Sufi sympathies,38 something we have already encountered in Nasafi's case and will see several times again in the eastern tradition. It is fair to say that the FM has not enjoyed much of a reception among Islamicists. Although Ritter brought the unique Istanbul manuscript to light some sixty years ago,39 its contents have not been the subject of any systematic analysis. It has on occasion been used 32 The text reflects an obviously contemporary preoccupa- tion with the Batiniyya uprisings in western Iran. The author speaks of the fall of Alamut (483/1090), and from the opening lines of the Batiniyya chapter it is clear that he saw himself as writing at a time of real Batini strength (Al-Firaq al- Muftariqa, 103, 11. 2-14). Ritter dates the text to 500 ("Philologika III," 46); the reasons for Danishpazhuh's choice of 540 are unclear to me ("Kitibshinasi," 110). 33 'Umar b.

For example, the insistent use of the term ikhtiyar distinguishes his position on human freedom from that of the Ashcarites, while the refusal to place man's evil acts outside of God's will (mashi'a, irada, taqdir) is di- rected against the Mu'tazila. The Maturidite sympathies of the author are clear in the ahl al-sunna's doctrine as it appears throughout the text.

The author's Sufism is, of course, clearly on the sober side; he condemns the antinomians who would have perfect love of God replace sharCi duties (idha kamulat al-mahabba irtafacat al-khidma; FM, 4, 11. 9ff.). 39 Ritter, "Philologika III," 45-46. by scholars,40 but the general lack of attention shown the work allowed Laoust to overlook it entirely in the genre study referred to above. Neither editor connected these two books with a late Persian firaq work published in Tehran in 1957 under the title Risdla-yi Macrifat al-Madhdhib (MM).41 The editor based his text on four manuscripts found in the India Office library. The MM is very clearly a Sunni work,42 and is probably of Indian provenance. The au- thor identifies himself as Muhammad Tahir Ghazali (known as Nazzam), a professor (mudarris) at a certain Madrasa-yi Jalali.43 I have not been able to identify him beyond this, but from the date of the earliest manuscript he must have lived before 1044/1634. The author's references to Abu Hanifa as imdm-i aczam, as well as citations from the Fiqh al-Akbar, locate him squarely in the Hanafi camp,44 and the presence of the earliest manuscript in a majmiCa containing works on tasawwuf may suggest Suifi connections of the sort we have already encountered with Nasafi and cUthman al-Hanafi. In 1963, M. J. Mashkur published an anonymous and untitled Persian firaq treatise under the title Haftdd-o Seh Millat. His edition is based on a unique Paris manuscript completed in Tabriz in 887/1472. This may (though, of course, not necessarily) imply a date of composition earlier than the Macrifat al-Madhahib. Since the author is clearly familiar with the poetry of Jalal al-Din al-Rumi (d. 667/1268),45 we can assume the text to be no earlier than the mid-seventh century A.H. We can also imagine the author to have had Sufi tendencies. Mashkur was unaware of any Hanafite-Maturidite heresiographical tradition, but he did link this Paris 40 E.g., van Ess, Erkenntnislehre (see index under cUthman b. CAbd Allah); G.

He speculated that either his own text was the source of the former, or that both the MM and the Haftdd-o Seh Millat came from the same source (possibly the FM).46 The first possibil- ity is not very likely for structural reasons; the author of the MM works within the distinctive eastern frame- work attested as early as Nasafi,47 while the Haftdd-o- Seh appears to deal with the seventy-three sects almost at random. The highly articulated presentation we have in the MM cannot have been produced from the Haftad- o-Seh. The second possibility (i.e., that both texts share a common source) is more attractive, but only if one dis- cards the FM as the likely common source. As we shall see, the FM includes material foreign to the eastern tra- dition, and mentions sects commonly given in the stan- dard literature but unknown to other eastern authors. None of this appears in the Haftad-o-Seh or the MM. The principal ancestor of the Haftdd-o-Seh would seem not to be the FM, but rather, Nasafi's text (or a work closely associated with it). This is clear from the refutational passages in the work-they all appear to be abbreviated versions of what Nasafi offers. Moreover, each refuta- tion in the Haftad-o-Seh is preceded by a short statement in Arabic, followed by a loose (and not always accurate) Persian rendering. These opening statements all echo passages in Nasafi. The fact that they are given here in Arabic strongly suggests, incidentally, that the author's immediate sources were in Arabic and not Persian. With the exception of Nasafi's Radd, all the works discussed up to now were known to Danishpazhuh when he published in 1967 two brief (and anonymous) heresiographical rasa'il, designated here R1 and R2.48 Danishpazhuh did not think to place these texts in a Hanafite context; had he done so, he would not have failed to mention the FM in his introduction to the two rasdiil.49 Still, the parallels between these two rasa&amp;il, the Haftdd-o-Seh, and the MM did not escape him.50 R2 is actually more in line with the eastern tradition as presented in Nasafi and his literary descendants than is 46 Haftdd-o-Seh, editor's introduction, 9. 47 This eastern framework will be discussed in more detail below. 48 "Do Risala dar-bareh-yi Haftad-o-Do Guruh," Nashra-yi Ddnishkadeh-yi Adabiyyat-i Tabriz 79 (1345): 247-59. 49 That he knew about the FM is clear from his earlier "Kitabshinasi," 110. 50 Danishpazhuh also mentions three other works containing similar information, which I have not been able to consult: the Hadiqat al-Shica of Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Ardabili (d. 993/1585) (Tehran, 1970); a Risala-yi Milal-o-Nihal, per- haps by Muhammad-i Jacfar Astarabadi (d. 1315/1897) (MS. R1. Both the structure and content of R2 closely match the descriptive passages in Nasafi; where differences appear, they seem to be the result of transmission er- rors rather than a fork in the tradition itself.51 R1, on the other hand, is more of a problem than Dan- ishpazhuh realized. It does not fit at all well with the texts following Nasafi's model. Although certain charac- teristically eastern sects are found here, others are miss- ing, and in their place are sects unknown to Nasafi and his literary descendants. Moreover, Nasafi's framework is entirely absent from the R1. There is no logic at all be- hind the presentation other than the division of the text into two sections: an opening list of the seventy-three sects (unaccompanied by any explanation of their be- liefs), and a sharh in which fewer than half of the groups listed at the beginning of the text are discussed. The author provides no refutation, and does not discuss the beliefs of the saved ahl al-sunna wa-'l-jamdca. The differences between this and the other eastern texts raise the question of whether the R1 reflects late corruptions of the tradition, or, alternatively, preserves something of its pre-classical origins. One possible answer is to be found in a late third-century popular Hanafite creed, the Kitab al-Sawad al-ACzam (SA) of the Hanafite qadi and sufi Abu '1-Qasim Ishaq al-Hakim al-Samarqandi (d. 342/953). The SA was composed in 290/902 at the behest of the amir IsmaCil b. Ahmad (279-95/892-907) and was in essence the official creed of Samanid Transoxania. The creed is well within the eastern Hanafite intellectual tradition, although it is not entirely consistent with what became classical Maturi- dism.52 It was translated from Arabic into Persian in the mid-fourth/tenth century.53 The SA contains a firaq chapter which is very likely the source of Danishpazhuh's Ri.54 Unfortunately, it is University of Tehran, shin, 2/319); and the Lubb al-Albdb of Muhammad Taqi Sipahani. See "Do Risala," 248. 51 Most of the differences between R2 and Nasafi are ortho- graphic. There is also some instability between sects (e.g., Na- safi's Imamiyya appear in R2 as Ismaciliyya, his Nawusiyya become R2's Imamiyya, and so forth). Bernand does not seem to have been aware of this parallel text when she published Nasafi's Radd in 1980. 52 For the unreliability of the later claim that al-Hakim al- Samarqandi was a student of Maturidi, and for the assessment of the text's doctrine as not quite Maturidite, see Encyclopedia Iranica, s.v. "Abu 'l-Qasem Eshaq Samarqandi" (Madelung). 53 Tarjuma-yi 'l-Sawad al-ACzam, ed. CA.

None of the extant versions of the SA appear to reproduce the original text; they contain anachronistic references to later scholars, and differ significantly in content and arrangement.55 Al- though the medieval Persian translation does contain a firaq chapter, not all the Arabic versions do; the only printed Arabic version I have been able to consult con- tains no heresiographical material, but Ritter's descrip- tion of the manuscripts seems to indicate that at least some Arabic recensions include a schematic firaq chapter.56 The instability of this heresiographical mate- rial in the manuscript tradition suggests that it is a sec- ondary addition to the SA. It is at least a bit out of place here, as each of the other sixty-one chapters is devoted explicitly to a discussion of one of the alleged sixty-two qualities (khisdl) which define the people of orthodoxy (al-sawad al-aczam). There does not seem to be room in the SA for a firaq chapter. On the other hand, the section in the Persian SA which deals with the sects is structurally reminiscent of the larger text (in both its Arabic and Persian incarnations). Just as the work itself opens with an enunciation of all sixty- two khisal before proceeding to comment on each of them, the heresiographical chapter begins with a list of the seventy-two sects, and only then launches into an extended commentary (dealing only with about half of them). It is also worth noting that even in the Arabic version, lacking the firaq chapter, the well-known seventy-three sects hadith is quoted immediately after the amma bacd.57 Heresiography was clearly not far from the author's mind. If the firaq material in the Persian translation of the SA is as old as the original late third-century text, it might represent what the eastern material looked like be- fore Nasafi's time. The SA could not have been the only source used by Nasafi,58 but it may well preserve mate- rial at an earlier stage of development than the latter. To these examples of eastern heresiography two manuscripts in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek can be added. Both are late, both are of Indian provenance, Parsa-yi Bukhari (d. 822/1419); see Fihrist-i Nuskhahd-yi Khatti-yi Farsi (Tehran, 1348-54/1967-75), 975. 55 Encyclopedia Iranica, s.v. "Abi 'l-Qasem Eshaq Samar- qandi" (Madelung). 56 Ritter, "Philologika III," 41. 57 Kitab al-Sawdd al-ACzam (Bulaq?, n.d.), 2, 11. 3-9. 58 In his Kharijite chapter alone, Nasafi mentions four groups (Ibadiyya, Kanziyya, Muhakkimiyya, and Khalafiyya) which appear neither in the SA nor in the R1. and both are written in Arabic. The first is a short text identified by Ahlwardt as an extract from the Tadh- kirat al-Madhahib (TM) of CAzim b. CAbd al-Majid al- Bahluwarui' al-CAzimabadi al-Bihari al-Qadiri.59 The book's structure is clearly Hanafite-Maturidite, and the text in general looks very much like an Arabic version of the MM: there are no refutational passages, the sect names match up with Nasafi (as do those in the MM), and the opening treatment of the ahl al-sunna closely parallels what we have in the MM.60 Although the text adds nothing fundamentally new to the eastern tradi- tion, it is a useful philological witness to have when dealing with some of the more puzzling passages in these works. The second Berlin manuscript is the Bahr al-Madha- hib (BM), composed in India in 1125/1713 by CAbd al- Wahhab al-QidwaDi al-Qannawji.61 The firaq material proper is contained in the second part (al-fann al- thdni) of the work, under the title Fi baydn madhahib ahl al-bidac wa-'l-ahwai.62 This is further divided into two sections (maslak), the second of which is of no interest as it merely reproduces the heresiographical section of Iji's Mawaqif (itself an epitome of Shah- rastani).63 The first maslak is considerably richer. It contains references to heresiographers of all stripes, summary sketches of their works, and finally, the au- thor's own, classically eastern, heresiography. It is Qannawji's discussion of different heresiograph- ical options that is of most interest here. For him, struc- ture rather than content is the basis for distinguishing one firaq approach from another. Although he does not 59 W.

Five of these appear to offer variations on the eastern approach: Nasafi's Radd;64 an unnamed book by the Hanafite scholar (CAli b. Muham- mad) Fakhr al-Islam al-Bazdawi (d. 482/1089);65 a work composed by "the author of the Sharh al- Wiqdya";66 and the two rasdail of Mahmud al-Ghazali67 and Ibn al-Sarraj (d. 771/1369).68 II. FORM AND STRUCTURE All of the eastern texts are structurally distinct from the standard heresiographers. Like many of the latter, they are based on the principle of fragmentation into 64 BM, fol. 193a, 11. 7-9. 65 BM, fol. 193a, 11. 14-16. See GAL, GI:373; SI:637f.; Kahhala, Mucjam, 7:192; Ibn Qutlubugha, Taj, 30-31; Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa', Jawahir, 1:372. There is a scribal error in the BM which might have eliminated the name of Bazdawi's book from the manuscript. The copyist has written wa-qad jacala 'l-imam Fakhr al-lsldm fi 'l-Bazdawi al-kaldm asndfahum al- sitta.... Brockelmann lists a Kitdb al-Muyassar fi-'l-Kaldm for him which might be the work in question; the book re- mains unpublished, to the best of my knowledge. Bazdawi's better-known Kanz al-Wusil ild Macrifat al-Usal (in the com- mentary of CAla' al-Din al-Bukhari, Kashf al-Asrar Can Usil Fakhr al-Din al-Bazdawi [Beirut, 1394/1974]) does not appear to contain any heresiographical material. 66 BM, fol. 193a, 11. 14-16. The work (or chapter?) is given the title Kitab al-Shahada. (The principal six sects carry laqabs closer to the FM than to Nasafi's text, but presumably the resemblance stops there: wa-faCala mithla md facala 'l- Nasafi.) I take the Wiqdya to be the Wiqayat al-Riwaya fi Masdail al-Hiddya of Burhan al-Din Sadr al-Sharica 'l-Awwal CUbaid Allah b. Mahmuid al-Mahbuibi (GAL, GI:377; SI:646). This work was heavily commented upon (see Hajji Khalifa, Kashf, 2020-24), but I am unable to connect a Kitab al- Shahada with any of its principal commentators. The author of the Sharh al-Wiqdya mentioned by Qannawji is probably the grandson of Sadr al-ShariCa al-Awwal, CUbaid Allah b. Mascid Sadr al-Sharica 'l-Thani (fl. 747/1346), who wrote the first arrangement of and commentary on the Wiqdya; see, e.g., CAbd al-Hayy al-Laknawi, Al-SiCdyafi Kashf Sharh al-Wiqaya (Lahore, 1396/1976), 2 (I owe this reference to Aron Zysow). 67 BM, fol. 190a, 1. 5; 193a, 1. 16. He is presumably the au- thor of the MM. 68 BM, fol. 190a, 1. 5; 193a, 1. 16. The Hanafite Mahmud b. Ahmad al-Qunawi (Ibn Abi 'l-Wafa', Jawdhir, 2:156-57; Ibn Qutlubugha, Tdj, 52-53; Kahhala, Mucjam, 12:149; GAL, seventy-two heterodox sects,69 but the eastern writers have their own distinctive way of producing that num- ber. They adopt a neat 6 x 12 plan: the Community is divided into six major sectarian groupings, each of which in turn splits into twelve sub-sects, producing seventy-two errant sects. This structure appears in Na- safi, and is closely adhered to in the Talbis, the MM, R2, TM, and by the authors mentioned in Qannawji's discussion (referred to above).70 The sect names used by heresiographers provide another quick means of gauging an author's indebtedness to the eastern tradi- tion. Not only are certain laqabs unknown outside the tradition, but the form in which the names are given is distinctive in the east. The eastern writers are much fonder of the abstract nisba iyya suffix than the stan- dard authors, and frequently attach it no matter what the conventional form of the name; for instance, Rafida often becomes Rafidiyya, Muctazila becomes Muctazil- iyya, and so forth. The six "mother sects" listed in the eastern sources are clearly meant to be read as three groups of oppositions, SII:90). Hajji Khalifa (Kashf, 1134, 11. 23-26) has him as the author of a commentary on the Hanafite creed of Abui JaCfar Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Tahawi (d. 321/933). This may be the work known to Qannawji. 69 The well-known hadith from which the number is derived is not cited by all standard heresiographers, and at least some Sunni scholars rejected it; see Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Kitab Ma- fatih al-Ghaib (= al-Tafsir al-Kabir) (Cairo, n.d.), 22:219 (on Q.21:93). For one approach to the tradition, see I. Goldziher, "Le d6nombrement des sectes mohametanes," Revue de l'his- toire des religions 26 (1892): 129ff. (= Gesammelte Schriften, IV:406ff.). See also M. Steinschneider, "Die kanonische Zahl der muhammedanischen Secten," ZDMG 4 (1850): 145-70; and his Nachtrag in ZDMG 57 (1903): 474-507. None of the eastern writers cites the kinder Murji'ite version of the hadith known to the geographer Maqdisi (d. 391/1000), in which seventy-two groups are given Paradise and only one ends up in Hell (Ahsan al-Taqdsim fi Macrifat al-Aqalim, ed. M. J. de Goeje, Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum, vol. 3 [Leiden, 1906]: 39, 11. 2-6 [with the kinder version said to be of stronger isnad though less well known]; Razi mentions it in the passage cited above). 70 This 12 x 6 division also appears (unfortunately with no doxographic elaboration) in the Nusra 'l-Diniyya, an anony- mous Hanafite theological work of the tenth/sixteenth century (Arabic Ms. R.13.19, Trinity College, Cambridge, fol. 27b, 11. 9-10). See Schacht, "An Early Murci'ite Treatise: The Kitab al-CAlim wal-MutaCallim," Oriens 17 (1964): 102-4. This framework is also found in the firaq extract described by Ahlwardt, Verzeichnis, no. 2170. 590</page><page sequence="9">LEWINSTEIN: Notes on Eastern Hanafite Heresiography each turning on one particular issue. To take the FM as an example, the Khawarij (text: Nasibiyya) and Rawafid are used to frame the dispute about the status of CAll; the Qadariyya and Jabriyya represent opposing views on the issue of qadar and human freedom of will; and the Mu- shabbiha and Mucattila signify the two extreme posi- tions available on the attributes of God.71 The effect is to allow the author a middle position for his own version of orthodoxy.72 In this connection, cUthman al-Hanafi cites one version of an admonition commonly attributed to the Kufan traditionist Shacbi (d. 103/721): "Love the family of Muhammad but do not be a Rafidite; leave to God mat- ters of which you are ignorant without being a Murji'ite; say that God commands goodness and justice but do not be a Qadarite; and command the good and prohibit the evil without being a Kharijite."73 Not all eastern writers follow this 6 x 12 model strictly. The Haftad-o-Seh treats the sects seemingly at random, as do the Rl and SA. The FM begins with the eastern six-fold breakdown, but there is no explicit mention of twelve sub-sects within each of the major groups. If this is the way three of the six groups are presented anyway, the remaining three split into thir- teen and fourteen firaq, thus skewing the author's chances to arrive at the requisite seventy-two. This suggests that cUthman al-Hanafi has begun with the traditional eastern scheme, but has gone beyond it.74 Throughout the text, in fact, there is a noticeable mix- ture of eastern and standard material, which is reflected both in the author's selection and his presentation of data. 71 The FM's terminology differs slightly from Nasafi, al- though the same mother sects are clearly meant. It is worth noting that the issues identified here are determinative for the general mother sect only. The sub-firaq within each category are not discussed exclusively with reference to these ques- tions. 72 The point is explicitly made at FM, 9, 11. 4-10, 1. 5. 73 Shacbi is frequently associated with these sorts of state- ments. See E. Kohlberg, "Some Imami ShiCi Views on the Sa- haba," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 5 (1975): 143, n. 2 (= idem, Belief and Law in Imami Shicism, Variorum Re- print 9 [London, 1991]. The version I have given here is Nasa- fi's [Radd, 63, 11. 1-4]). The language at FM, 9, 11. 1-3, is considerably different. This is one small example of why Na- safi is unlikely to have been the principal eastern source for the FM. 74 This is most obviously true for the author's treatment of the Batiniyya, Majus, Jews, and philosophers, for which there is no precedent in the eastern tradition as we have it in Nasafi; see FM, 98ff. Unlike most standard heresiography, texts in the eastern tradition are explicitly geared to refutation rather than (tendentious and loaded) description. None of these authors seem the least bit interested in history or anecdote; they present for each sect a quick doctri- nal precis (usually one or two points) followed by a paragraph or two of refutation anchored in the Qur'an and hadith. This exegetically based refutation is a fea- ture peculiar to eastern Hanafite writing;75 it does not seem to be characteristic of Muctazilite (or Muctazilite- based Ashcarite) texts. The preference for refutation over description is probably the reason we see almost no individuals (historical or otherwise) mentioned in the eastern sources. If the standard heresiographers like to connect doctrines and sects with individual he- resiarchs,76 writers in the eastern tradition are con- cerned first of all with doctrinal abstraction. With one exception, Nasafi associates no specific individuals with the heterodox sects he discusses;77 where here- siarchs appear in the FM they are clearly the product of contamination from the standard tradition. What are the origins of this 6 x 12 refutation-based scheme? It would seem that the raw material in Nasafi had already been well worked through by earlier writ- ers. A structure as tight as Nasafi's presupposes a gen- eral agreement among writers on the names of sects, their identity, and their chief doctrines. At one point Nasafi suggests that he has inherited the names of his sects (and perhaps his entire framework?).78 Moreover, 75 Van Ess, Erkenntnislehre, 27 (with reference to the FM). 76 See J. Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu (Oxford, 1978), 116 ("The evolution of doctrine is there reduced to a series of discrete biographies"). On the structural importance of the heresiarch see J. van Ess, "Die Kamiliya: Zur Genese einer haresiographen Tradition," Die Welt des Islams 28 (1988): 146; and K. Lewinstein, "Making and Unmaking a Sect: The Heresiographers and the Sufriyya," Studia Islamica 76 (1992): 75-96. 77 At Radd, 86, 11. 14-18, Nasafi mentions a Nishapuri Shi- Cite ascetic with mahdist pretensions, Tahir b. SaCId b. CAbd al-Majid al-Iskaf[i]. Nasafi also mentions having personally disputed with a Zoroastrian theologian in Balkh (Radd, 92, 1. 14). Other than these two examples, individuals appear in this text only as transmitters of material. 78 He introduces the contents of the work with balaghana Can tasmiyatihim annahum sittatu asnf. . . (Radd, 60, 1. 15). Elsewhere Nasafi's immediate authorities are given for specific bits of material, such as haddathana bi-jami' ma fas- sartu Ahmad b. Yacqab Can Salih Can Ibn CAbbas (Radd, 118, 1. 18. I can identify neither Ahmad nor Salih; for a possible identity of the latter, see van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 48); 591</page><page sequence="10">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) the structure of his refutational passages suggests that he was not the first of his kind, even if he is the earliest left to us. These passages consistently begin with the statement, "The orthodox community believes (qalat al-jamaa) . . .,"79 and more often than not this "ortho- dox" position is followed by a personal statement by the author introduced with the phrase qala Abi Muti'.80 The redactor's deliberate distinction between Nasafi's own language and that of the community may indicate a school tradition older than Nasafi himself. What this earlier program looked like is impossible to say. The sect lists we have, for example, in the SA and the R1, probably do not reflect the very beginnings of the tradi- tion. They might, however, reflect early attempts in the east to canonize a diffuse body of material. Finally, it is worth noting that the literary character of the eastern texts is more unified than that of the standard books. There is no discernible difference in form between material on the Shicites and material on the Kharijites, for example. Everywhere sects are intro- duced with the same language, and everywhere they are refuted in the same way. This is quite different from what we have in the standard sources, which quite obviously preserve material of many different origins; for example, Ashcari's discussion of the Shi- Cite sects can, on purely formal grounds, be assigned an origin entirely different from that of his Kharijite discussion.81 This unevenness within the material is something which works to the advantage of scholars hoping to get behind the classical sources. We are not so fortunate, however, with the Hanafite-Maturidite texts. By the time the eastern material comes into view it has been rendered thoroughly homogeneous and brought into the service of Hanafite theology. Were the standard sources to look like this we would know very little indeed about the earliest sects. samiCtu Aba 'Ali 'l-Husain b. al-Ashraf (Radd, 93, 1. 19 and 69, 1. 2 [given as al-Hasan]; see 125, 1. 8 [al-Hasan]); and note the two Karramite Sijzis given above, n. 28. 79 The term ahl al-sunna wa-'l-jamdca had been employed in Transoxanian Hanafite circles by the third/ninth century, and by the fifth/eleventh had come to have exclusively Hanafite-Maturidite associations.

The late BM (192a, 11. 11-12) counts as ahl al-sunna wa-'l-jamada both the Maturidites and the Ashcarites. 80 Sometimes the two are conjoined (qala Abu Mutf wa-'l- jamaca); e.g., Nasafi, Radd, 81,1. 5; 83, 1. 5; 84, 1. 15; 88, 1. 5. 81 See Cook, Dogma, 94-95. III. CONTENT For anyone accustomed to the standard heresio- graphical accounts, the eastern sources look confused and superficial.82 This may well prove to be true, al- though any such assessment will have to await a closer study of the material than we now have. Toward that end, I would like to offer two very short case studies. The examples I shall discuss have to do with fifteen or so Persian Kharijite groups of the second/eighth century which the standard heresiographers treat under the rubrics CAjarida and Thacaliba. They share descent from the rebels CAbd al-Karim b. CAjarrad (fl. early sec- ond century) and Thaclaba b. Mushkan (a renegade CAjradite and contemporary of Ibn cAjarrad).83 From Ashcari on, all of these groups are treated as a network or cluster in the standard literature. They form a dis- crete unit almost always kept intact by the heresio- graphers; if one group is moved, its dependent firaq move with it. Before AshCarl, however, things may not have been so stable. The fact that the network is struc- turally intrusive in Ashcarl's Maqaldt suggests that it may only have been recently acquired by the tradi- tion.84 Pseudo-Nashi' al-Akbar, whose work pre-dates AshCari by nearly a century,85 does not seem to have a place for the cluster, as such, in what can be recon- structed of his presentation; he mentions one key CAjradite sect individually, and does not seem to know of any larger network.86 It can therefore be assumed 82 To take one of many examples, if we had only the eastern sources we would believe the Kaisaniyya to be a Qadarite sect uncertain about whether human af'al are the creation of man or God (Nasafi, Radd, 89, 11. 12-14; MM, 12, 1. 16; Haftad-o- Seh, 36, 11. 7-10; R2, 206, 1. 16). Only the FM (34, 11. 1-7) has something close to the usual story, although the principal term there is Ishaqiyya (for Abu Ishaq al-Mukhtfr). There is no question that the author of the FM availed himself of more standard materials. 83 The best discussion of these groups as they appear in the standard heresiography is Madelung, Trends, 58-70. 84 K. Lewinstein, "Studies in Islamic Heresiography" (Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1989), 37-40. 85 Published in J. van Ess, Friihe muctazilitische Haresio- graphie: Zwei Werke des Nadsi al-Akbar (gest. 293 H) (Beirut, 1971). For a revised attribution of the text and a dating to the early third/ninth century, see W. Madelung, "Friihe muCtazili- tische Haresiographie: Das Kitab al-Usul des 6acfar b. Harb?" Der Islam 57 (1980): 220-36 (= Religious Schools and Sects, no. 6). 86 Pseudo-Nashi' considers the Khazimiyya (normally an 'Ajradite group) to be a sub-sect of the Azariqa (Haresiographie 592</page><page sequence="11">LEWINSTEIN: Notes on Eastern Hanafite Heresiography that the network only entered the standard tradition with Ashcari or a close predecessor; the material itself may well have been known, but it was shaped into a cluster only at a relatively late date, presumably as a means of integrating it into a pre-existing heresio- graphical framework.87 Like pseudo-Nashi', the eastern writers do not know of an CAjarida cluster, although they are familiar with many of the groups normally discussed under that ru- bric. Clearly, the network structure in Ashcari and his successors is secondary; it reflects an editorial decision made in the standard, but not in the eastern, tradition. When such an editorial decision is made, material in- evitably falls out and is lost to the tradition.88 There- [text], 69,11. 6-13). He appears to give the Khazimiyya the prom- inence usually reserved for the CAjarida as a whole. See Made- lung, Trends, 63-64. Van Ess is struck by the absence of the CAjarida from the list of Kharijite mother-sects given by the au- thor (Hdresiographie [commentary], 53). It should, however, be noted that the 'Ajrida do not commonly figure among the usul al-Khawarij, but are instead linked either with the Najdiyya or Baihasiyya, and sometimes with the Sufriyya (AshCari, Maqdldt, 93, 1. 3; 95, 1. 11; Nashwan al-Himyari, Kitab al-iiHr al-'cn [Teh- ran, 1973], 171, 1. 1 [from Balkhi]; Shahrastfini, Kitdb al-Milal wa-'l-Nihal, ed. W. Cureton, 2 vols. [London, 1846], 1:95,11. 12- 13). Shahrastani considers them among the kibr firaq al-Kha- warij (Milal, 1:86, 11. 9-10), but even in the later tradition this is exceptional; the sixth-century Zaidi Qadi Jacfar b. Ahmad (on whom, see Madelung, Der Imam al-Qdsim ibn Ibrahim und die Glaubenslehre der Zaiditen [Berlin, 1965], 212-16) does not mention them among the Kharijite usul (Ibanat al-Mandhij fi Nasihat al-Khawarij [Cairo, Dar al-Kutub, 25499b/film 25709], fol. 155a, 11. 1-4). 87 Although there is no hard evidence for it, it seems pos- sible that this structure was first erected by the Shaficite scholar Husain b. CAli al-Karabisi (d. 248/862). Karabisi's lost Kitdb al-Maqaldt was in the third century widely known as the primary source for information on the Khawarij and other early sects (mucawwal al-mutakallimin fi macrifat madhdhib al-khawdrij wa-sd'ir ahl al-ahwa'); see Subki, Tabaqat al- ShdfiCiyya 'l-Kubrd, 6 vols. (Beirut, n.d.), 1:252, 1. 6; and Baghdadi, Usul al-Din (Beirut, 1401), 208, 11. 15-16. Some heresiographical independence is suggested by the fact that he was not a Muctazilite. He is counted as a "Jabrite" by Ibn al- Nadim (Fihrist, ed. G. Flugel [Leipzig, 1871], 181, 1. 5); see Halm, Ausbreitung, 16-18. 88 And, of course, material could have been deliberately ex- cluded. How else can we explain the appearance of the Persian Atrafiyya in no source earlier than Shahrastani's Milal? (Milal, 1:97, 11. 1-4; and see the similar-sounding doctrines associ- ated by Ashcari with the Ibadiyya [Maqdlat, 106,11. 9-10] and fore, consideration of the Persian groups mentioned in the eastern sources might prove useful in getting us be- hind the standard heresiographical cluster. A) The Kiziyya. This is a group commonly men- tioned by the eastern writers, but entirely unknown to the standard tradition from Balkhi and Ashcari on.89 The practices associated with the sect involve a strict, and in the eyes of the eastern heresiographers, exces- sive, attention to matters of ritual purity. It is worth noting that the cataloguing of eccentricities in ritual law is a favorite pastime of the heresiographers, who use such material to underscore the deviations of the firqa under discussion.90 There is usually no easy way of assessing the reliability of such data. According to Nasafi, the sect's approach to tahara has a theological basis. Because the Kiziyya hold the belief status of all individuals (including, presumably, their own co-religionists) to be ambiguous, they are led to adopt extraordinary precautions in order to avoid pollu- tion; for instance, they require ritual ablutions and re- pentance even after innocuous social encounters.91 This Ibn Hazm with the Sufriyya [Fisal, 5:31, 11. 20-32, 1. 2]. See also Madelung, Trends, 68, for a discussion of the Shahrastani passage.) It is also worth noting that even after the network structure was well established, heresiographers did not forget the earlier textual instability. Most writers take the trouble to assign the cluster sects specific numbers (AshCari, for ex- ample, calls the MaCbadiyya the second firqa of the Thacaliba and twelfth of the CAjarida, and speaks likewise of all the other cluster sects: p. 98, 1. 4 and elsewhere). This sounds like an attempt to delimit the borders of the network. A need may have been felt to hold the line against groups which were by general agreement coming to be excluded from the cluster. 89 But see below, n. 108. 90 Zysow has remarked on this in connection with the here- siographical treatment of the Karramiyya: "Remaining within the accepted parameters of ritual law was thus of considerable symbolic importance, and within ritual law, the laws of purity must have been especially sensitive barometers of social co- hesion" ("Texts," 582). For an illustration of this on the Kharijite side, see Lewinstein, "Azariqa," 261-64. 91 Nasafi, Radd, 73, 11. 9-11: zaCamat an la yasacu li-ahad an yamassa ahadan li-annahu la yacrifu man al-ctahir wa-najis min-hum wa-la yasacu li-ahad an yukhalita ahadan wa-la an yu'akilahu [text: yuwdkilahu] illa an yaghtasila wa-yataba li- annahu ishtabaha amr al-umma bi-ma zahara min-hum min al-munkarat wa-'l-islam wa-ahluhu tahirun. See Ibn al-Jawzi, Talbis, 20, 11. 1-2 (under Mukramiyya, a laqab known only to the standard tradition). For the more relaxed Sunni position re- garding the persons and clothing of both unbelievers and believers in a state of pollution, see Shafici, Kitab al-Umm 593</page><page sequence="12">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) concern for purity, moreover, involves urinating only in special receptacles (kuz, whence the group's laqab) and the wearing of a restrictive covering (kis) on their geni- tals (yattakhidhuna li-madhakirihim kisan).92 Most of the other eastern sources follow Nasafi here. The three Indian texts focus on the group's extremist approach to tahara, in language which echoes the R2 and Nasafi.93 And the two works which might preserve the earliest stratum of material, the R1 and the SA, present a Kuziyya doctrinally similar to Nasafi's, al- though in language different enough to make direct borrowing unlikely.94 More interesting are two variations on this material preserved in the east. The Haftdd-o-Seh speaks not of a Kuziyya but of the orthographically close Lawziyya. The author explains this laqab in his Persian para- phrase of the opening Arabic description of the sect. That is, just as any one nut (lawz) appears similar to others of its kind before it is shelled, so it is with people; idolators are rotten at the core, and believers are pure, but both look the same on the outside. Since belief and unbelief are essentially internal matters, it is not possible to distinguish between the two categories, and believers must keep themselves apart from oth- ers.95 Although the behavior and theological substra- tum are the same, nothing in the Persian body of the work appears to draw directly on Nasafi's text. It is possible that the Haftdd-o-Seh preserves a strain of ma- (Cairo, n.d.), 1:54,11. 1-12; 55, 11. 5-9; and 89, 1. 11; Sarakhsi, Kitdb al-Mabsat, 30 vols. (Cairo, 1324-1331 A.H.), 1:97, 11. 1- 14; Ibn Qudama, Al-Mughni, 9 vols. (Cairo, 1367/1947), 1:82, 11. 11-14; and see G.-H. Bousquet, "La puret6 rituelle en Islam," Revue de l'histoire des religions 138 (1950): 56. 92 Nasafi, Radd, 73, 1. 12. The tahdra motivation is more ex- plicit elsewhere in the tradition, and will be taken up below. On the kis, see below, n. 98. 93 MM, 9, 1. 12; BM, fol. 196a, 1. 6; TM, fol. 42b (with Law- ziyya for Kuziyya; see below); R2, 255, 1. 14. 94 Both texts are clearly based on the same source, and focus on tahdra and the use of the kuz in urination: SA (Persian), 185, 11. 1-3; Rl, 253, 11. 16-20. The Rl is corrupt; Zysow sug- gests reading R1, 253, 11. 16-17 as la yutahhiruna abdanahum tul al-nahdr (personal communication). This makes good sense of the orthography, although doctrinally it would seem to conflict with everything else we hear about Kuizite ablution practices. 95 Haftad-o-Seh, 51, 11. 9-13: gayandjawz-o-lawz-o-pisteh- o-funduq dar pust hameh yaksdn and chin bishikanid baczi an bashad keh lubbi u naghz nist va-baczi an bdshad keh maghz naddrad ahl-i shirk najis al-'ain bdshand va-ahl-i imdn tdhir va-dar sirat-i hdl hameh yaksdn and chun kufr-o-imdn dar dil terial excluded from Nasafi's presentation, but the text is much more likely to represent a late corruption of the tradition. The second variation is in the FM.96 There we have four charges levelled, all of which concern the sect's teachings on matters of ritual purity. (1) The Kuziyya do not permit urination or defecation into the earth, the Prophet's having called the earth a place of prayer (masjid wa-tahir).97 Thus, they relieve themselves only in running rivers or special jugs (kiz, kizdn). (2) They consider ablutions obligatory whenever coming into contact with another person (see Nasafi). (3) They wear a special covering (kis) on their genitals as a bar- rier (hajizan baina 'l-dhakar wa-'l-thawb).98 And (4) they do not pray in trousers (sardwil).99 The FM's presentation is an expansion of what we have in Nasafi, and the aversion to trousers is entirely ast pdk az palid padid nist pas khud-ra az hameh adamiyyan nigah bayad dasht mabdda keh najis shavi va-nadani. 96 FM, 18, 11. 18-19, 1. 2. 97 Cemeteries and bathhouses are among the places usually excluded from masjid status when the hadith is cited; see, for example, Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, 6 vols. (Beirut, 1398/1978), 3:83, 11. 10-12; and the versions given in Shafici, Umm, 1:92, 11. 1-2; and Ibn Hazm, al-Muhalld, 11 vols. (Cairo, 1347- 1352), 4:27, 11. 2-33, 1. 4. 98 The legal issue here is not spelled out. I have seen such a thing elsewhere only in Imami tradition, where, according to one hadith, a man can wear a cotton-padded kis over his penis if he has a tendency to drip urine or blood during prayer. (The point, presumably, is to protect the state of tahdra.) See Tusi, Tahdhib al-Ahkam, 10 vols. (Najaf, 1378-1382/1959-1962), 1:348 (no. 1021). If this is not the issue the heresiographers are thinking of, there is one other likely possibility, namely, that the Kuziyya require such a barrier to prevent any acciden- tal touching of the genitals during prayer. Since the fuqahda do not normally regard accidental contact by the calf or thigh (such as might occur during prayer) as polluting, the Kuzite practice is made to look out of bounds; see Ibn Hazm, Mu- halld, 1:236, 11. 10-237, 1. 1. The intentional handling of the genitals does not seem to be the issue here, as that is regarded as polluting by all but the Hanafites. See Ibn Hazm, Muhalla, 1:235ff. (no. 163); ShaCrani, al-Mizdn al-Kubrd, 2 vols. (Cairo, n.d.), 1:118, 1. 28f.; Shafici, Umm, 1:19, 11. lf.; Ibn Rushd, Biddyat al-Mujtahid, 2 vols. (Cairo, 1386/1966), 1:40, 11. 3-41, 1. 7; and see Bousquet, "La puret6 rituelle," 57. 99 Once again, the issue is not entirely clear. They either pray naked or in another type of garment. The latter is more likely; the author's refutation implies that the dispute is over the best garment to wear in prayer, not the principle of satr al- Cawra. The sect may fear the sarawil coming into contact with 594</page><page sequence="13">LEWINSTEIN: Notes on Eastern .Hanafite Heresiography new. This last point is unlikely to have been of the au- thor's own making, since it matches a report preserved by the traditionalist heresiographer Malati, who men- tions that very practice in connection with an anony- mous Kharijite group based in Sijistan, Herat, and Khurasan.'10 At first glance, Malati's presentation of this sect seems bizarre and incredible.l01 But when comparisons are made with the eastern material, some suggestive parallels arise. Like the eastern tradition's Kuiziyya, Malati's Kharijites manifest a strong interest in tahara. They take great trouble over the clothing they wear during prayer, and they insist on performing wudii' at the very spot on which they intend to pray the anus during ordinary wear, and thus insist on changing into the izdr for purposes of prayer. (See the following note.) Shafi'i, it may be noted, prefers the izar as well, although for other reasons; while the sarawil are acceptable as long as the requirements of satr al-'awra are fulfilled, the izar is more concealing and thus preferable (al-izdr astar wa-ahabb min- hu); Umm, 1:89 (penult.). The wearing of the sarawil is an is- sue in legal discussions of ihrdm. For the muhrim on hajj, the sariwil should be chosen only if the izdr is not available. See ShaffiCi, Umm, 2:147, 11. 5-23; Ibn Qudama, Mughni, 3:281, 11. 7-19 (= H. Laoust, Le Precis de droit d'Ibn Qudama [Beirut, 1950], 77); Ibn Hazm, Muhalld, 3:209,11. 8ff.; and see R. Dozy, Dictionnaire detaille des noms des vetements chez les arabes (Amsterdam, 1845), 203f. If, on the other hand, a polemical accusation of naked prayer is hidden here, there is a striking echo in one of Vam- bery's (more fanciful?) travel accounts from Central Asia. The people of Bukhara, according to Vamb6ry, "sometimes repeat their prayers stark-naked, from a religious scruple, that their clothes might have been defiled without the eye having de- tected it" (quoted in L. Conrad, "The Dervish's Disciple: On the Personality and Intellectual Milieu of the Young Ignaz Goldziher," Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society [1990]: 253). On the requirement of satr al-Cawra during prayer, see, for example, Shacrani, Mizdn, 1:169, 11. 20f.; and on the margins, Dimashqi's Rahmat al-Umma fi 'khtildf al-A'imma, 1:35, 11. 13-35, 1. 37. 100 Malati, Radd, 42, 11. 12-20. The group is presumably afraid that trousers will become polluted by the anus (al- sarawil jubb al-fiqdh). A conceptually similar (though in fact opposite) charge is heard from another heresiographer in con- nection with the Karramiyya: they allow prayer in unclean garments. See Ibn DaCi, Tabsirat al-CAwamm fi Macrifat Maqalat al-Anam, ed. 'Abbas Iqbal (Tehran, 1313), 67, 11. 16- 17; cited in Zysow, "Texts," 583, n. 45. 101 Cook dismisses Malati's Kharijite account as looking "more like a collection of howlers than a genuine tradition" (Dogma, 99). (fearing that movement of the rectum caused by walk- ing would invalidate their state of purity). Yet at the same time, and contrary to the general Muslim view, they do not regard breaking wind as necessitating an ablution. 102 Much of this might have been shaped by polemical needs. The sect's approach to ritual purity, a touchstone of communal affiliation, swings from one extreme to another. Zysow has detected just this sort of double- edged attack on the Karramiyya's tahara practices, and with the help of a Karramite legal text he was able to begin to separate the polemical exaggeration of heresi- ographers from authentic doctrine.'03 Unfortunately, as is so often the case in these matters, we have no Kiizite fiqh with which to control the heresiographical presen- tation, and the question of credibility has to remain open. What we can be certain of, however, is that 102 For the general Sunni view on flatulence, see Ibn Hazm,, Muhalla, 1:232 (no. 160); Shafici, Umm, 1:17, 11. If.; and see Bousquet, "La puret6 rituelle," 57. Elsewhere in the heresio- graphical tradition Ibn Karram is similarly accused of treating the fart lightly (Ibn Da'i, Tabsirat al-'Awdmm, 66, 11. 13-18; 67 (penult.)-68, 1. 6; passages cited in van Ess, Ungeniitzte Texte, 13, 14). The image used by Ibn Karram of Satan at- tempting to fool the worshipper into thinking he had passed wind (and thus voided tahara) also appears in Sunni and Imami tradition, where reassurance is given that only a fart with sound or smell violates one's state of purity (laisa Calaika wudiiu hatta tasmaCa 'l-sawt aw tajida 'l-rih); see Tisi, Tah- dhib, 1:347 (nos. 1017, 1018); Kulini, Furac al-Kdfi (Tehran, 1375-1377), 1:36 (no. 3); Sarakhsi, Mabsat, 1:86, 11. 17-21; Shacrani, Kashf al-Ghumma Can Jamic al-Umma, 2 vols. (Cairo, n.d.), 1:62, 11. 17-20. Sound and smell are frequently mentioned in the legal discussions of flatulence, and the point is to protect the worshipper from continual doubts about his tahdra: the certainty of an ablution properly performed over- rides the doubts raised by the possibility of a silent and odor- less discharge of wind. The larger question of certainty is very likely behind Malati's picture of Khfirijites afraid to walk after performing wudii', lest the movement of the rectum spoil tahara. To ordi- nary Muslims, this behavior is seriously unbalanced; far from attaining religious certainty, the sect has given in to doubt. Just that sort of thing is what the lawyers wish to avoid; see Sarakhsi, Mabsat, 1:86, 11. 3-16; and the example in Ibn Hazm which echoes Malati's Kharijites (idhd kdna ahadukum fi 'l-salatfa-wajada haraka f dubrihi ahdatha aw lam yuhdith fa-ashkala Calaihi fa-la yansarif hattd yasmaca sawtan aw ya- jida rihan; Muhalld 2:79, 11. 17-18 [from the Prophet], as well as the author's preceding discussion of yaqin and shakk). 103 Zysow, "Texts," 582-83, and nn. 45 and 46. 595</page><page sequence="14">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) Malati and the eastern heresiographers have the same sect in mind. Both attest the presence of purity-minded Kharijites (something we do not meet in the standard tradition), and in both cases it might be a scripturalist mentality which the heresiographers are describing.'04 Malati is perfectly explicit about his group's scriptural- ism (ya'khudhana bi-'l-Qurain wa-ld yaquluna bi-'l- sunna aslan),105 and the Kuziyya's fear of pollution through contact with unbelievers may have a scriptur- alist dimension as well.106 104 A scripturalist approach to law is observable in the stan- dard tradition on the Kharijites (though not, of course, in con- nection with the Kiziyya). See Lewinstein, "Azariqa," 260-64, and the literature cited there. 105 Malati, Radd, 42, 11. 13-14. Malati's portrait of a sect whose members insist on performing ablutions at the very spot on which they pray may well have originated as a carica- ture of the scripturalist attitude toward ablutions. Against the general Sunni consensus that ablutions need not be performed before each of the five daily prayers, Zahirite and Shi'ite ju- rists take Q.5:6 (idhd qumtum ila 'l-salatfa-'ghsili wujahakum wa-aidiyakum) as requiring renewal of wu.du' before each prayer, even without an explicit violation of tahara. In this they are following one ancient line of interpretation ultimately overriden by prophetic hadith and a restrictive interpretation of qumtum. See J. Burton, "The Qur'an and the Islamic Prac- tice of Wudui," BSOAS 51 (1988): 24-25, 32, 38-41; and see I. Goldziher, The Zahiris (Leiden, 1971), 46-48; A. J. Wensinck, "Die Enststehung der muslimischen Reinheits- gesetzgebung," Der Islam (1914): 79-80; Jassas, Ahkdm al- Qur'dn, 3 vols. (Cairo, 1347), 2:402, 11. 8-406, 1. 24; and Shafici, Umm, 1:121f. Sarakhsi lampoons the ashdb al-zawdhir on precisely this point, noting that such an interpretation of the verse would re- quire additional wudui from the believer each time he gets up from his ablutions, thereby preventing him from ever perform- ing the prayer (fa-qiyds madhhabihim yajib anna man jalasa fa-tawadda'a thumma qdma ild 'l-salat yalzamuhu wudu'i dkhar fa-l yazalu kadhalika mashghilan bi-'l-wudut la yata- farraghu li-'l-salat wa-fasdd hddha l yakhfa Cald ahad); see Mabsut, 1:5.3-15. The accusations in Malati echo just this sort of caricature. It is worth noting, however, that a Zahirite of Ibn Hazm's stature does not insist on the direct connection between tahara and salat seen in Malati's Kharijite sect. The verse does not, in Ibn Hazm's view, require that prayer immediately follow ablu- tions (al-aya lam tujib ittisdl al-salat bi'l-tahdra la bi-nassihd wa-ld bi-dalilfi-hd); see Muhalla (1:75, 11. 8-19), where Ibn Hazm allows a delay between wudui and prayer, even while insisting that the former is valid only for one prayer time. 106 It is a considerably more extreme version of the Shicite position, which implicitly bases itself on Q.9:28 (innama These parallels between Malati and the eastern firaq authors do something to salvage the former's reputation and establish the latter's credibility outside of Transox- ania.'07 In this case, however, it appears that what we have are neither idiosyncracies nor stupidities, but the residue of a genuine tradition which sought (either fairly or unfairly) to discredit the Kharijites on issues related to ritual purity and scripturalist legal behavior. This may well have been a tradition known to the earliest Muctazilite heresiographers, if for some reason eventu- ally excluded from the classical framework.108 B) The Shimrakhiyya. This group is better known in the eastern than in the standard sources. The Ashcarite- Muctazilite writers do not normally mention a Shimra- khiyya in their Kharijite accounts, and when they do, the group is excluded from the main part of the heresio- graphical framework.'09 This does not make them a less credible sect; it simply makes them less important 'I-mushrikun najas); see the discussion in Goldziher, .Zdhiris, 58-60; and see Tusi, Tahdhib, 1:262, 11. 15-263, 1. 13; and idem, al-Istibsar, 3 vols. (Najaf, 1375-1376/1956-1957), 1:89, 11. 7-16. See also E. Kohlberg, "Non-Imimi Muslims in Imfmi Fiqh," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 6 (1985): 99-105 (= Belief and Law, no. 10). 107 Regarding Malati's reliability, one of the examples Cook cites in his criticism of Malati's Kharijite presentation (see above, n. 101) is partially attested in the east, namely, Azra- qite pacifism. In at least two eastern sources, we learn that the Aziriqa (traditionally the most violent and warlike of the Kharijite groups) was a politically quietist (if not quite pa- cifist) sect: yarawna ta'at al-sultan fardan sawdaan amara bi-'l-taa am bi-'l-macsiya wa-yukaffiruna man khalafa amr al- sultan wa-yastahillina damahu (FM, 12, 11. 10-11). This sur- prising piece of information is attributed to Maimfin b. Mihran (d. 116), who goes on to associate the notorious al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf with the Azariqa, apparently because he killed Muslims simply for differing with the government! Nasafi has another version of this, in which Maimiin states that it is permissible to pray behind a Kharijite "since we used to pray behind that Haruri-Azraqi al-Hajjaj" (Radd, 78, 11. 16-19, where the comparison is clearly meant to be ironic; see Ibn CAbd Rab- bihi, al-'lqd al-Farid [Cairo, 1316 A.H.], 3:16, 11. 30-33). 108 Outside of the eastern sources the Kuziyya are men- tioned only by Maqdisi (Kitdb Bad' al-Khalq wa-'l-Ta'rikh, ed. and tr. C. Huart, 6 vols. (Paris, 1916), 5:134, 1. 13 (no doc- trine given). This account of the Kharijite sects is chaotic, but clearly in the Muctazilite tradition. Reference to the Kuziyya here is therefore striking, and may suggest that the sect was known to the Muctazilite writers at some point early in the tradition. 109 AshCari, for example, mentions the group only in the cha- otic final third of his Kharijite chapter, when he is clearly bring- 596</page><page sequence="15">LEWINSTEIN: Notes on Eastern .Hanafite Heresiography structurally to the standard heresiographers. That the sect actually existed, however, and was a specifically Persian group which might as well have been included in the cluster, is suggested by Ashcarl's citing an early firaq authority here, and a Thaclabite one at that.110 The standard writers derive their laqab from a proba- bly fictional heresiarch, CAbd Allah b. Shimrakh,"' and associate two rather undistinguished doctrines with them: they consider the murder of opponents forbidden while in a state of taqiyya (a mainstream Ibadi posi- tion), and they consider the murder of one's parents (even if opponents) always forbidden.12 Also, along with the Sufriyya, they are willing to pray behind an imam whose status as a believer is ambiguous."13 The Shimrakhiyya do not quite fit in the standard framework, where they are used by writers largely as stuffing for a somewhat anemic account of the Su- friyya."4 Things are different in the east. According to Nasafi and his literary descendants, the Shimrakhiyya are known primarily for their sexually licentious prac- tices, on account of which they are considered part of the "Hubbiyya." They are said to hold all women to be ing in material supplementary to the principal framework lying behind his account (Maqaldt, 120, 11. 1-4; and 126, 1. 11). 110 Like all heresiographers, Ashcari does not often cite his sources. In this case he cites Yaman b. Ribfb (Maqalat, 120, 11. 1-4; and see 126, 1. 11, where Shimrakhite material is quoted from a specific, though anonymous, heresiographer). Ibn Ribab is the earliest authority cited anywhere in Ashcari's Kharijite pre- sentation. He was a late second/eighth century Khurasanian Tha'labite-turned-Baihasite, and is said to have written a Kitdb al-Maqaldt. These geographical and sectarian credentials make it likely that the Shimrakhiyya were in fact a second-century Per- sian sect, along with the other cluster groups. On Ibn Ribfb, see Cook, Dogma, 98-99; and Madelung, "The Shi'ite and Khfrijite Contribution to pre-AshCarite Kalam," in Islamic Philosophical Theology, ed. P. Morewedge (New York, 1979), 127. 111 But Baghdadi mentions in passing a certain Abu Shim- rakh in an account of the breakup of the Najdiyya Khawarij (Kitdb al-Farq Baina 'l-Firaq, ed. M. Badr [Cairo, 1323/1905], 69, 1. 15). I am unable to trace either form of the name in the historical literature. 112 Ashcari, Maqaldt, 120, 11. 1-4 (citing Yaman b. Ribab); see Ibn CAbbad, Kitab al-Kashf Can Mandhij Asnaf al-Khawarij, ed. M. T. Dfnishpazhuh (Nashra-yi Danishkada-yi Adabiyyat-i Tabriz 2 [1347 Sh.]), 147, 11. 21-22; Kirmfni, Sharh Qawl Rasul Allah...., apud Dedering, "Ein Kommentar iiber die 73 Sek- ten," Le Monde oriental 25 (1931): 38, 1. 19; Saksaki, Burhdn, fol. 5b, 11. 18-6a, 1. 1 (citing as a source sahib kitab al-firaq). 113 AshCari, Maqaldt, 126, 1. 11; the sense is more explicit in Hur, 177, 11. 18-19 (from Balkhi). 114 Lewinstein, "Making and Unmaking a Sect," 88. as sweet-smelling herbs (raihan, rayahin), available for every man to enjoy without benefit of formal mar- riage or concubinage (inna 'l-nisad hunna 'l-rayahin la ba'sa Cald man yashammuhunna bi-ghair nikah wa-la milk).15 Shimrakhite marriage need not involve guard- ian, witnesses, or dower.1"6 The eastern writers clearly wish to put the reader in mind of the Shicite practice of mutCa marriage, in which neither guardian nor witnesses had secure roles."17 Such ascription of Shi'ite-sounding practices to other sects is found elsewhere in the eastern sources, as well.18 It may bespeak confusion or deliberate polemi- cal misrepresentation, but it may also reflect real diver- gence in legal practice between different Persian Kharijite communities.11 If so, the material preserved in 115 Nasafi, Radd, 75, 11. 6-8; see Haftdd-o-Seh, 76, 11. 13- 77, 1. 8; MM, 10, 11. 19-21; R2, 255, 1.20; Rl, 250, 11. 5-6 (with the addition of communism of property, not elsewhere attested for the group); BM fol. 197a, 1. 1; TM fol. 42b. 116 Only the FM departs from the eastern consensus here, but still remains closer to that than to the standard view of the sect. That is, the Shimrakhiyya-Hubbiyya insist, in the manner of antinomian Sufis, that their sins and religious laxity are ex- cused as long as their love of God is sound (FM, 20, 11. 9-10: al-mahabba idha sahhat tartafiCu 'l-khidma wa-'l-amr wa-'l- nahy wa-yazCumuna aidan anna ahl al-mahabba bi-tark al- saldt wa-'l-siyam wa-'rtikdb al-macdsi macdhiruin). (The final reference to sin being excused may be an allusion to sexual misconduct, since this is how the author's refutation begins.) The Hubbiyya are mentioned later in the FM as well (69, 11. 1-4), directly parallel to Nasafi's own discussion of the sect (Radd, 102, 11. 6-103, 1. 6). Clearly, the author of the FM used material of varying degrees of closeness to Nasafi. His reference to an CAbd Allah b. Shimrakh (FM, 20, 1. 7) also suggests familiarity with the standard account. 117 I. Howard, "Mutca Marriage Reconsidered in the Context of the Formal Procedures for Islamic Marriage," Journal of Semitic Studies 20 (1975): 82-92. See also Schacht, The Ori- gins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (Oxford, 1950), 182-83. 118 Notably, in connection with the Kanziyya Khawarij (un- known to the standard writers), who are said to bury the zakdt in the ground rather than pay it to the enemies of God (Nasafi, Radd, 74, 11. 7-10; Bernand has read "Kathriyya" for "Kan- ziyya," and consequently taken yaknizuhu as yukthiruhu in the descriptive passage. The root k-n-z is clearly required by the sense of the passage, and that is indeed how it appears else- where in the eastern tradition). For the Imfmi doctrine that part of the khums should be buried, see N. Calder, "Khums in Imami Shici Jurisprudence, from the Tenth to the Sixteenth Century A.D.," BSOAS 45 (1982): 40. 119 This is certainly the impression one gets from the stan- dard cluster presentation, which preserves not only theological 597</page><page sequence="16">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) the east might complement the picture offered by the standard writers. It is conceivable that some of this Shimrakhite mate- rial was known to the standard heresiographers before the Persian Kharijite cluster was finally assembled. There are accusations of sexual permissiveness in the standard accounts of the Persian Kharijite sects, but the accused sect is never the Shimrakhiyya and the nature of the ibaha is quite different. The Maimuniyya and CAjarida are said to permit marriage to one's grand- daughters and grandnieces, a doctrine which Baghdadi (perhaps unfairly) sees as a Zoroastrian borrowing and uses to place the group outside of the firaq al-lsldm.120 Similarly, pseudo-Nashi' connects the Khazimiyya- CAjaridal21 with the presumably scripturalist view that marriage is permitted with the niece of one's wife.122 If none of this is quite what we have in the eastern sources, Malati (from Khushaish?) gets us considerably closer; an anonymous Kharijite sect is said to allow mar- riage in the absence of legal witnesses.123 Once again, the ShiCite association is unmistakable, but this external disputes but concrete disagreements on taxation and the like. See Shahrastini, Milal, 1:95, 11. 12-100, 1. 9; and see Made- lung's remarks, Trends, 61. 120 AshCari, Maqaldt, 95, 11. 12-15 (citing Karabisi); Shah- rastani, Milal, 1:96b, 11. 8-14 (from Karabisi); Ibn Hazm, Fisal, 5:31, 11. 8-10 (Karabisi); BaghdadI, Farq, 264, 11. 13-265, 1. 6. Scripturalism would seem a more likely explanation than Zoroastrianism (i.e., Q.4:23 does not explicitly forbid such unions). See Goldziher, "Kampfe um die Stellung des Hadit im Islam," ZDMG 61 (1907): 864, n. 5; Cook, "CAnan and Islam: The Origins of Karaite Scripturalism," Jerusalem Studies in Ar- abic and Islam 9 (1987): 170; and Madelung, Trends, 64. 121 Here considered an Azraqite sect; see above, n. 86. 122 Hdresiographie, 69,1. 12: abdhi nikdh al-marPa Cald Cam- matihd wa-'ala khalatihd. The group pointedly follows the mar- riage prohibitions in Q.4:23 despite the traditional view that wives' aunts are also within the forbidden degrees and thus un- marriageable; see, for example, Shafici, Umm, 5:5,11. 5-6,1. 10, where the issue is put explicitly as one between those who ac- cept and those who reject tradition as a source of law; and Ibn Hazm, Muhalla, 9:521, 11. 18-525, 1. 4. See also Ricks, "Kin- ship Bars to Marriage in Jewish and Islamic Law," Studies in Islamic and Judaic Traditions (Atlanta, 1986), 131. Madelung takes the reports from Karabisi of the Maimuiniyya's marriage practices (above, n. 120) as a polemical deduction from the more modest deviation of marriage to an aunt of one's wife. 123 In Malati, Radd, 137, 1. 18. Khushaish elsewhere men- tions a Shimrakhiyya by name, but associates no doctrine with them (136,1. 3). confirmation suggests that the eastern writers were more than merely confused polemicists, and that this material at some stage had a larger constituency than Transox- anian Hanafism. The eastern writers were in at least some places working with a genuine body of material ulti- mately excluded from the classical MuCtazilite-AshCarite tradition. Malati alone is perhaps not much to go on, but as in the case of the Kuziyya, he demonstrates that the eastern material may reflect more than merely the po- lemical imagination of local heresiographers.'24 It is still unclear just how far these connections can be pushed, and to what extent the eastern material can help us outflank the third/ninth century wall which confronts anyone working with the standard heresio- graphy. What is clear, however, is that the material represents one more variation on an old-fashioned theme, namely, the establishment of an orthodoxy through the creation of excluded group and doctrines. As such, these books should prove important to any study of the typology of heresy in Islam.125 124 Another example of this is Malati's listing (from Khushaish?) of a Jacdiyya Kharijite sect, named for a certain Muslim b. al-JaCd of Kufa (Malati, Tanbih, 138, 1. 1; see van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft, 1:405). The laqab is un- known to the standard writers, but appears in the east for a Kharijite sect (though without the heresiarch and only in the SA [Persian] [172, 1. 2; 181, 11. 19-182, 1. 3] and R1 [249,1. 7; 251, 11. 5-6]). The easterners trace the label to the group's pe- culiar anthropomorphic description of God (la-hu shacrjacd). (The precise sense here is unclear to me; on the multiple meanings of this expression, see Lane, Arabic-English Lexi- con [London, 1863], s.v. j-'-d.) It should also be noted that the laqab Thac'liba is distinc- tively pointed Taghlibiyya in every eastern source I know. This is also how they appear at the end of Malati, with the ad- dition of a heresiarch called Taghlib (Tanbih, 136, 1. 7). 125 Several of the texts discussed in this paper were first brought to my attention by Professor Hossein Modarressi, and I would like to record my appreciation for that here. I would also like to thank Professors Aron Zysow, Michael Cook, and Wadad Kadi for a number of useful comments on what would otherwise have been the final draft of this article. 598</page></plain_text>
