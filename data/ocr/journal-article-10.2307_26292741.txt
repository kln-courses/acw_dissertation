Given the human paleontological evidence for the musculoskeletal  hypertrophy of these populations, inferred high activity levels throughout the life cycle, burden carrying, and periods  of stress, as well as the archaeological evidence for considerable human movement and raw material transport across  the landscape, it is unclear how the artists involved could have become so familiar with normal human patterns of  corpulence (the adiposity paradox). Seasonal semi-sedentism and short term high caloric input, as is suggested by  archaeological evidence, may explain the occasional presence of such obesity, sufficiently frequently to permit accurate  artistic renditions of the resultant human form.
