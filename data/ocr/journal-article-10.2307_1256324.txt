HUTTON, C.I.E., M.A. (Read at Meeting, Ioth December, 1924.) I SUPPOSE that there is no part of the world in which, in an area no greater than that of Assam, there is so striking a diversity of tribes and tongues. In the administered portion of the Naga Hills alone there are eleven different languages, not to mention dialects often so diverse that one village cannot understand that of its neighbours. The other districts of Assam are not quite so heterogeneous as that, but that is a fair type of the Province as a whole. Along with this diversity in language we find not un- naturally a similar diversity in customs and beliefs, and it is my purpose in this paper to review shortly some of the views held by different tribes upon a few astronomical phenomena, so as to see, if it may be, how far they are traceable to some common origin or, on the other hand, are beliefs evoked independently by the tribes that hold them in order to supply some explanation of familiar but mysterious experience. VOL. XXXVI. H</page><page sequence="2">114 Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. I purpose also to point out some instances of the same beliefs in other areas outside Assam. The tribes dealt with extend from the North of the Province, where it merges with Tibet, to the South, where the Lushei Hills reach down almost to Arakan and the Bay of Bengal. The most familiar constellations in Assam are those of Orion and the Pleiades, which are visible throughout the cold weather when the sky is clear. The Miris of the North bank of the Brahmaputra appear to regard these constellations as representing a young man or men (Orion's belt) pursuing girls (the Pleiades) across the sky." The Sema Nagas also regard the Pleiades as girls, but as girls who were caught and killed in a raid.2 On the other hand they regard Orion's belt as the Roof- tree Carriers,3 as do the Angamis,4 an idea that seems to recur again among the Abors on the North bank of the Brahmaputra, as the Galong Abors call it Karig-ipe, " the star roof-tree," though the Pasi, Padam, and Minyon Abors speak of it as a " quiver and arrows " 5 The Lhota Nagas again describe it as three men searching for lost cattle. As for the Pleiades, the Angamis regard them as men who were killed while digging out rats, and the Thado speak of them as seven brothers who had only one cloth between them and had to cover themselves with it at the same time. Others speak of it as a hen and her chickens, and the Khasi as the Hen-man. The Belt of Orion the Thado describe as a kind of rat which digs a very straight deep hole at first, and then turns off at right angles, this part being represented by Orion's sword. The Lushei associate Orion with the square of Pegasus, and regard the whole as representing a 1 Communicated by Mr. E. Bardalai, as is the subsequent information, as to Miri beliefs. 2 J. H.

There is therefore very little uniformity as regards Orion and the Pleiades among the Assam tribes, though the idea of the roof-tree appears in two places among tribes widely separated and of very different customs and language. Another obvious and familiar constellation in Assam is that of the Milky Way. This constellation is visible early in the cold weather, and we find it generally associated with the cleavage between the end of the rains and the beginning of the cold weather. The Lushei call it Thla Sikkong (" The Way of Winter "), and the Abors " The Cold Weather Guide "; so too the Miri call it " Winter and Summer Boundary," and the Ao Naga the " Cold-Weather- Rains-Divider." With the Chang Nagas it has the same association, and its appearance in the cold weather is welcomed with joy as showing that the rains are over. So, too, the Angamis regard its appearance as indicative of fine weather, though they speak of it as " Pfiu's Water Channel," which is also the name given to the Barak River, which, like the Milky Way, runs from North to South. The Sema Nagas, on the other hand, speak of it as the " Soul River." In the case of Venus, no two tribes seem to agree on the subject at all, though several have names which are picturesque enough. The Angami call the evening star " The Thief Watcher," as it shines at the time thieves and housebreakers are busy, while the Abors call it " Fish Eye " and say the fish do not feed till it sets, or " Fish-blink," because it looks this way and that to avoid the net of the sun, or the " Moon's nurse " (Abors employing small children to carry about their infants for them), while they call the morning star Ru-pun (" Blossom of Dawn "). The Semas apparently recognise the identity of these two aspects of Venus, but I am doubtful whether most tribes do. Except for the Semas, the ones mentioned have, at any rate,</page><page sequence="4">116 Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. different names for the two appearances, and the Lushei definitely regard the morning star as a girl and the evening star as a chieftain, who, they say, meet in the zenith and marry. When we come to the Sun and the Moon we find a good deal more uniformity. I should say, in passing, that there seems to be no worship of the sun or moon at all, though they are called on to witness oaths, " since they see all that takes place," as a Naga put it to me. On the other hand the Chang Nagas, like the Aos, attribute virtue to the rising sun. They are also careful to observe the place where the sun rises, marking it by the alignment of some familiar tree or post in the village against the peaks on the horizon, and there are also amongst the Angamis certain persons who observe the sun and note the day in which it turns back from its northern course, and Mr. J. E. Tanquist informs me that a man of Kohima named Sitsalie, who takes such observations, assures him that the sun has not of late years risen at quite so northerly a point on the horizon as it used to do in the days of his youth. He also tells me that the method of co-relating the solar to the lunar year, which the Angami, like the Chang Nagas, do by the insertion of an intercalary month, is done by guesswork. The Terhengi festival begins on the 16th day of the twelfth lunar month. When this festival, which celebrates the completion of the harvest, seems to fall much too early, an extra month is thrown in " only after much wrangling in which the whole village takes part." I find that the Cherama clan of Kohimna village observe a different calendar to the other six clans, apparently regulating it by observations of the sun, while the others have the lunar system. The respective genders of the sun and moon vary. According to the Galong Abor they are both neuter and a sort of objets d'art. The Lhota Naga is more explicit, and describes the sun as a flaming plate of hard metal, the</page><page sequence="5">Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. 117 size of the ground on which a basket of seed is sown.* The Pasi, Minyon, and Padam Abor, however, as also the Miri and apparently the Mishmi, regard the sun as male and the moon as female, which, for some reason seems to us a very natural and proper allocation of gender, though the Aka regards them both as masculine. On the other hand, many if not most of the Assam hill tribes, including the Dafla,7 the Khasi, and nearly all the Naga tribes, I think, regard the moon as the male and the sun as female. There is, however, underlying both views of the genders of the sun and moon a story of an interchange of functions between them which links together the two views and shows how the one may have arisen from the other. The bare outline of this tradition is that the moon performed the functions of the sun, and a great deal more vigorously than the sun does now, but something being thrown in his face, his heat was abated, and he was reduced to the inferior function of lighting the night. We see this tradition of the interchange of functions appearing in a more or less garbled form throughout the various accounts of the luminaries. For example, the Miri state that the marks on the moon are caused by human dung thrown at her by another deity in a quarrel. The Mishmi state that the sun and moon were husband and wife. The moon demanded a share of the heat of the sun, who got angry at her importunities, saying he had to keep it all for his children,-mankind,-and threw the moon down into a pond, the mud of which still clings to her face. As a result of this she is afraid to venture out by day, and so waits till the sun has gone behind the hills.6 The Rangpang Nagas of the Patkoi have a story which links these versions to the other ones. At first the sun and 6 J. P. Mills, The Lhota Nagas, p. 172. 7Communicated by Capt. Nevill, as are other particulars as to the Aka and Dafla. 8 Communicated by Mr. T. P. M.

She, however, told the monkey, who went round and told everyone else. The moon was angry and abused the sun, who took it to heart, and relieved her feelings by drying up everything on earth and killing all things with excessive heat, but, when a dry branch from a dead tree fell on the moon and killed him too, the sun herself died of grief, and ultimately the two were re-born with the sexes reversed.9 This inversion of the sexes, however, does not form part of the usual Naga story, which is content with saying that on account of his excessive heat a man threw ashes or cow dung in the moon's face, and told him to shine at night only, when it was cooler, instructing the sun, who till then had lit the night, to shine in the day, as she was less harmful. The Angamis add a point which indirectly recalls the Mishmi version in saying that the sun, being womanly, is afraid to go out at night, which the male moon does not fear to do. The basis of the interchange of functions story also partly appears in the Khasi view that the moon falls in love monthly with his wife's mother, who throws ashes in his face,10 and more clearly in the version recorded by Col. Gurdon," in which the ashes reduce the moon's heat, which was previously as strong as the sun's. The Garo story likewise records an interchange of functions of a very similar description. So, too, the Thado Kuki record that the moon and sun had their functions interchanged, though the mountains visible on the moon's surface are described by them, and by some Ao Nagas, as a tree,'x and not, as by 9 Communicated by Mr. R.

This tree which the Thado see is no doubt the same tree as that which the Rangpang Nagas, as already noted, regard as having fallen on the moon and killed him. The Angamis regard the markings on the moon, which they say is as big as a field, as a giant nettle-tree. When we turn to the eclipses of the sun and moon, there seem to be two quite different ideas. The prevailing notion is the familiar idea that the sun is eaten up by a monster of some sort. With the Sema and the Ao Naga it is a tiger that eats up the orb. According to the Kabui Nagas,16 the Manipuris, and the Lushei 1' it is a dog. According to the Singpho it is a frog,18 and according to the Khasi 19 it is a toad or frog, and I have seen in a Konyak Naga morung a carving representing a frog eating the moon, though I could obtain no further information as to its significance. According to the Miri it is a demon that eats the moon, and they call him Raghon. The Aka call him Tsipzebhu, and describe him as a god who quarrels with the orb and tries to eat him. The Dafla have a more circumstantial version, which strikes one as combining the notion of the orb's being devoured with an idea that it is obscured by its passage through a building. They relate that the god Tammui built a house on the spot crossed by the moon from east to west just after his creation. Tammui asked the moon to make a diversion, but the moon insisted on cutting her path straight through Tammui's house, on which they quarrelled. Tammui shot an arrow at the 14 J. H.

The moon passed on, however, and out through Tammui's body. Later the sun, following the moon, took the same path, and Tammui ate her up too. This he contrived to do to both orbs from time to time, and it is a portent of disaster to mortals. The other idea of the causation of eclipses is found in an ingenious notion of the Angami that it is due to the eclipsed orb's having to repay to the other one a loan of borrowed light. This idea does not, so far as I know, occur elsewhere in Assam, though it seems, perhaps, to have influenced Mishmi ideas, seeing that, as already stated, they ascribe the marks on the moon to mud that stuck to her when he threw her into the pond because she importuned him for a share of his heat. Parhelia are regarded as portents of disaster by the Sema,20 the Ao,21 and the Manipuri.22 The next phenomenon in my list is the rainbow. As to this I have not been able to obtain very much information about beliefs in Assam, but among the Naga tribes it appears to be regarded as the heavenly bridge used by the sky spirits in their communications with the earth. At any rate the Semas call it Kungumi 'phuku, which was translated to me as " Sky spirit's leg," but which could equally mean " Sky spirit's bridge," and that, in the light of the parallels to be adduced shortly, is what I am convinced it does mean. Moreover, they say that the spot at which it touches earth is one at which some offering has been made in the fields to the sky spirits, while if it should touch the earth at any village a noted warrior of that village will die, his spirit, as I suppose, passing up the rainbow to the sky. This, too, I take it, is the point of putting imitation rainbows on the graves of great men in the Ao and Chang countries, though Mr. Mills told me he could obtain no specific reason for it 20 J. H. Hutton, The Sema Nagas, pp. 226, 252. 21 Communicated by Mr. Mills. 22 T. C. Hodson, The Meitheis, p. 121.</page><page sequence="9">Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. I2 among the Aos, and the Changs I asked would not say more than that it was the custom. Among the Angamis also, they say it is the path of a god, and regard it as fatal to approach the foot of the rainbow. It is perhaps the same idea which makes the Meithei of Manipur see the rainbow form about the head of his Raja,23 though the old Kuki idea of the rainbow as the lips of God spread to drink, picturesque as it is, seems little to the point.24 Among at any rate the Angami, Sema, and Ao Nagas the rainbow must not be pointed at lest the finger wither. Earthquakes cannot strictly be called astronomical phenomena, but I have taken the liberty of including them in this paper. Here again the beliefs fall into more than one category, some tribes associating them with the ghosts of the dead, others again with the subterranean move- ments of a great serpent, and others with a god of the lower world. Thus the Dafia regard earthquakes as caused by the spirits of the dead clearing the jungle from their path on their way to the underworld. When there is an earth- quake the Dafla stands up, fearing that if he remains seated disease will attack him. The Memi division of the Angami Nagas regard earthquakes as caused by the souls of the dead men throwing their spears at Pirhe, or Pekujikhe,25 who is the guardian of the world of the dead, and wrestling with him,2 while I was told, rather vaguely, by a Khasi that the Khasis ascribe them to war somewhere or other, possibly the same idea. This notion of earthquakes as caused by ghosts seems to be linked to that of the responsibility of a god under the earth by the Kachha Naga story given by Soppitt,27 in which 23 T. C. Hodson, The Meitheis, p. 121. s4 J. Shakespear, op. cit., p. 184, and he adds that the rainbow is also regarded as simply God's " Glory." 25 Cf. Sir G. A.

I6.</page><page sequence="10">122 Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. a dead king going to paradise married the daughter of the god. A struggle took place in consequence of the dead king's attempt to set himself up as his father-in-law's equal, and the king, having been defeated by the aid of his wife, who tied his feet together with her hair, was imprisoned in the centre of the earth, whence his struggles to free himself are felt by men as earthquakes. In a Kabui Naga version of the same story, the wife snatches a lock of her husband's hair and throws it in the fire, thus causing him to be worsted,28 as Samson by Delilah. The other Kabui account of earth- quakes given by Hodson 29 is that a deity under the earth named Bangla-ong sent a grasshopper to bring him fire from above. This grasshopper reported that men were all dead. The deity shook the earth to see if they were alive, so, when an earthquake takes place, they say, " We are alive." This is virtually identical with the story of the Akas on the lower Himalayan slopes, who accuse the mole-cricket of burrowing down into the earth, and telling the god Phumbadega the same lie with the same results. The Singpho (or Kachin) have apparently the same story, substituting a beetle for the cricket.30 By the Sema earthquakes are attributed to spirits shaking the earth to find out how the crops are going and its general purport. This is usually followed by a poor harvest, the reason for which is to be found in the Ao practice (reported by Mr. Mills) of holding steady the basket of cooked rice during an earthquake in order that the rice spirit may not be frightened away. The Lhota Naga likewise hold steady the meat rack over the fire and the bin with the daily rice supply.31 No doubt the same fear of the spirit of the rice etc. being frightened away by the earthquake is present when the Manipuris call " Fish! Rice ! " 32 as the earth quakes, perhaps 21 T. C. Hodson, The Naga Tribes of Manipur, p. 128. 29 Loc. cit. 30 O. Hanson, op. cit., p. 120. 31 J. P. Mills, The Lhota Nagas, p. 172. 32 J. M'Culloch, Statistical Account of Munnipore, p. 3.</page><page sequence="11">Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. 123 not as suggested by Hodson 33 in order that the spirit shaking the earth may hear and desist, but addressing the fish and rice to keep the soul matter of them from being frightened away, just as those attending on a dying Naga keep calling his name into his ear, as they do also when a man faints, to cause the soul to return to the body, a view which is possibly supported by the consideration that, in the case of the Lhota at any rate, the cause of the earthquake is not exactly the deliberate act of a god, but the movement of a great serpent coiled round the world, a legend shared in Assam by the Abor in the North and the Lushei in the South; and so too the Thado Kuki attribute earthquakes to this serpent's succeeding in biting his own tail. The Ao legend, however, is that an anthropomorphic being called Ningtangr holds up the post that supports the sky, and that it is when he gets hungry and leaves his post to pluck certain leaves to eat, that the post shakes and there is an earthquake.34 The Garo legend recorded by Playfair 35 also refuses to fall into line with any other Assam legend known to me. It is that the earth is square and slung on a rope, or supported by a leg, at each corner. In the former case a squirrel gnawing the rope, in the latter a mouse moving up the leg, causes the earth to shake. The Khasis in an earthquake tap their children's backs and say " grow quickly," but I have been unable to obtain any explanation of this. So much for the beliefs within Assam. I would turn now to their parallels in so far as I am able to indicate them outside that Province, and begin as before with Orion and the Pleiades. The Miri legend of youth pursuing maiden- hood is apparently allied to a Hindu tale of Bengal. This would not be unnatural, as the Miris have of late been a good deal influenced by Hinduism. The same idea, 33 T. C. Hodson, The Meitheis, p. III. 14 Communicated by Mr. J. P. Mills. 3 A. Playfair, The Garos, p. 88.</page><page sequence="12">124 Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. however, is found among the Karens, who regard the three stars of Orion's belt as having seized as wives the daughters of the Pleiades.36 The only other external parallel I can offer is the Khasi name of " the Hen-man " for the Pleiades. This, Hooker points out,37 is distinctly reminiscent of the Italian name for that constellation, " the Chickens," and he might have gone further and added, I believe, that the Lincolnshire term was " Hen and Chickens," though I am unable to quote any specific authority for this. Probably it is the twinkling elusive aspect of the individual stars of that constellation which suggests the sudden erratic movements of little chickens. There is, however, a curious parallel between the Naga and the Greek in the matter of the number of the Pleiades, for whereas the Angami, like the Mech tribe, sees seven stars in the constellation, the Sema sees six only, but states that there used to be seven once, just like the Greeks, who stated that there had been seven but the seventh star, SterOpe, had become invisible from shame, so that only six could any longer be seen.38 The Milky Way appears as the division of the seasons somewhere in East Africa, I think. Turning to the sun and moon, we find the ascription of a masculine gender to the moon and feminine to the sun is widespread outside Assam. The Semang of Malay make the sun female.39 The Oraons of Chota Nagpur make the moon masculine,40 and so do the Fijians; 4 and so also some of the early Scandinavians,42 while the moon is masculine and the sun feminine in western Germany; so also the Eskimo, who appear to follow the Khasi in ascribing to the moon 36 H.

There seems to be an echo of the Mishmi version in the Santal story of the sun and moon recorded by Bompas,44 though, as with the Mishmi, they make the sun masculine. The Nicobarese have the story of the interchange of functions,a and the Malays a tradition which suggests it.46 The Igorot of the Philippines clearly have had it,47 as Lumawig turned one of two suns into a moon for the benefit of mankind. The dung or ashes of the Naga version becomes a hare elsewhere,--(there are no hares in the Naga Hills). In Ceylon it is a hare which is thrown (by Buddha) at the moon,48 as also in Mexico,49 while the hare is associated with the moon in Burma and Japan, as well as apparently in parts of Africa. In Melanesia, however, where again there are presumably no hares, the thing thrown is a yam mash 50 or hot leaves.51 The underlying idea is, however, the same throughout. The orb of day was much too hot, and so he had his face daubed and his functions exchanged with those of the orb of the night. Moreover the idea seems hardly of a kind to originate independently in many different places. On the other hand, the description of the objects seen in the moon's face as a tree, which has been here noted of the Thado Kuki, and the Angami, Rangpang, and 43 Peschel, quoted by Skeat and Blagden, op. cit., vol. ii. 203 n. 44 C.

He would be a rash man who would state that if " X " saw a likeness to a tree in the markings on the moon " Y" having the same idea in another continent must have got it from " X." On the contrary, if the likeness between the markings and a tree is clear enough to be observed by " X" it is clear enought to be observed by " Y " also. One cannot, there- fore, attach much importance to the fact that the Poly. nesians also regard the markings on the moon's surface as a tree.52 Still, it is worth noting in this connection that a remarkable coincidence seems to exist between the Maori story of a man in the moon and a Scandinavian version in that in both versions the victim seems to have been fetching water by night at the time of his abduction. In the Maori version the water fetcher climbed a tree to escape the moon, when the tree fell on to the moon's surface with the climber. Can the introduction of water be traceable to something suggested by the vivid reflection of the moon so often seen in that element ? If so, it seems suggestive again of the Mishmi theory of the moon having got her face muddy by being thrown into a pond. Further, the tree stories seem linked up with the interchange of function stories by the Palaung view of the fierce heat of the moon as intercepted and kept from damaging the earth by the banyan trees growing on the moon's face.53 Turning to the causation of eclipses, the Angami notion that an eclipse takes place when the orb is repaying a loan of borrowed light or heat, seems possibly to be present in a garbled form among the Munda of Chota Nagpur, who state that the eclipse is caused by the orb's being surrounded by the emissaries of God, dunning the orb for the debt of the 52 W. Ellis, Polynesian Researches, vol. iii. p. 171. 53 Mrs. L. Milne, The Home of an Eastern Clan, p. 365.</page><page sequence="15">Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. 127 Mundas," though why there should be debts due between the orb and mankind and of what sort they are is not stated. Whether the idea is to be found anywhere else or not I do not know, but the idea of the orb's being devoured is common enough, of course. In China,55 Siam,56 and among the Subanos of the Philippines,57 and the Semang of the Malay Peninsula 58 it is a dragon that devours it. In Manchuria,59 in China again,60 and among the Karens of Burma e6 it is a dog, as in some parts of Assam, while the idea that it is a spirit that devours the orb spreads from Hindustan 62 through the Malay Peninsula, where it is held at any rate by the Besisi,63 Mantra, 64and the Negrito Sakai,65 to Polynesia,66 and the same idea seems to have extended to Italy, where Livy 67 writes cum aere crepitu, qualis in defectu Lunae silenti nocte fieri solet, clamorem edidisse, no doubt to frighten the spirit into letting the moon go, exactly as is done in the Assam hills. Perhaps we have the real key to this explanation of eclipses in the Palaung view of the sun, the moon, and the dark orb which crosses them, as the three heavenly orbs, originally brothers, who fought over their food.68 While on the subject 54 Sarat Chandra Roy, The Mundas and their Country, p. 489. 55 G.

This, however, would seem again to be merely the result of common observation of a natural process, since the latest researches into the germination of plants seem to show that polarised light, like that of the moon, hastens the dissolution of starch grains and so aids the germination of seed. Indeed it seems just conceivable that the theories of the one time excessive heat of the moon may have been falsely deduced from some actual knowledge of the con- duciveness of lunar light to germination. This idea seems the less extravagant when one realises that the Chinese practised or practise as an ordinary method of testing in court the legitimacy of offspring a coalescence of blood test69 of the same sort as one recently suggested for that purpose as a result of the most modern investigations of the human blood. Like some Assam tribes mentioned, the Chinese regard parhelia as portents of evil.70 I should also perhaps notice in passing the Naga theory of successive layers of sky worlds. This view is held by the Ao 71 and by the Lhota Nagas,72 and it is also held by the Chinese73 and by some, at any rate, of the Polynesians.74 One is, of course, familiar with the expression " Seventh Heaven," but the Chinese and Polynesians agree in making it ten. As regards the rainbow, I mentioned that it appeared to be regarded by Nagas as the " Bridge of the spirits." This is probably a widespread idea. It is found in the Andamans, where it is regarded as the bridge by which the 69 S. Kidd, op. cit., p. 303. 70 N. B. Dennys, The Folk-Lore of China, p. 120. 71 Communicated by Mr. J. P. Mills. 72 J.

Likewise in Teutonic mythology the rainbow appears as the bridge of the gods into heaven,78 and also of the dead.79 It is, no doubt, this aspect of the rainbow as the path of spirits that causes it to be forbidden to point the finger at it, as the distribution of this taboo seems much the same as that of the belief that the rainbow is the path of the spirits. Thus we find it forbidden in Germany (Brunswick), and China,80o among the Karen of Burma,81 and the Dusun of Borneo,s82 in the last two cases the penalty being a lost or withered finger as with the Nagas, and also among the Lifuans of the Loyalty Islands,83 where the penalty is the death of the offender's mother. In the case of earthquakes the explanations given in Assam seem to have no particular relation to those else- where, unless the one which ascribes it to the movements of a great serpent encircling the earth is to be connected with the great serpent Mitgard of Scandinavian mythology, which seems not impossible. The results ascribed to an earthquake all over Assam do, however, reappear in the Loyalty Islands, where again earthquakes lead to short crops, but not, as we are told, owing to the flight of the frightened rice spirit, but owing to the actual abstraction of the yam roots by the spirit below who shakes the ground in the process." 75 A.

The question now arises as to whether any conclusion can be drawn from the rather heterogeneous information collected in this paper. At any rate one or two facts seem to emerge. As regards the constellations, there seems to be little cohesion or identity of ideas among the various Assam tribes, and such ideas as exist seem to have com- paratively little connection with the ideas of other people. In the case of the sun and moon, however, there is a tradition of a time when the moon was the hotter of the two, and of an interchange of functions between the two, effected generally by throwing something into the moon, which seems fairly constant throughout Assam hill tribes, and this tradition extends to the Nicobars, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, the Pacific, and apparently South America, and this particular idea, coupled as it seems to be with the ascription of a masculine gender to the moon, which seems to extend to North Europe via Mongolia, is not of a nature which suggests independent invention as any but the most improbable of explanations possible. In the case of the rainbow, again, we have a taboo on pointing with the finger which extends from Germany to the Loyalty Islands, while in the case of earthquakes there seems to be much less cohesion of ideas. It is further obvious that those ideas which show the most cohesion and the clearest trace of a wide distribution are ideas about the sun, the moon, and the rainbow, which are more or less constant phenomena, whereas the con- stellations are invisible for half the year and consequently, except in certain localities, are not phenomena of ordinary and frequent experience. Considering the isolation of the Assam tribes, until quite recent years, one is perhaps justified in ascribing the former group of ideas to some pre-migratory origin, the latter ideas with regard to less perceptible or less obvious phenomena having been de- veloped by different groups for themselves at a later date. Whether these pre-migratory ideas are Caucasian or</page><page sequence="19">Some Astronomical Beliefs in Assam. 131 Mongolian in origin I do not presume to guess. Both stocks are credited with having contributed to the racial composition of Assam, Indonesia, and the Pacific, as well as of Northern Europe. One school would perhaps attribute these ideas as to the sun and moon to gold-seekers from Egypt, and I can conceive of the degradation of the moon to an inferior position being interpreted as the survival of a tradition of the overthrow of a lunar by a solar race, but the fact that the sun is so often the female seems to militate against this, and I do not myself find either idea particularly convincing, and must be content to leave the question as it is for the present, awaiting the collection of additional data. My own inclination is, I confess, to look to China for the distributing centre of most of these beliefs. J. H. HUTTON.</page></plain_text>
