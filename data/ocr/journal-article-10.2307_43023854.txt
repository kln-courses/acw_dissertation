<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRICK D. MURPHY University of California, Davis Robinson Jeff er s' Macabre and Darkly Marvelous Double Axe Robinson Jeffers presents in "The Double Axe" a two-bladed narra- tive poem with the first blade, "The Love and the Hate," a macabre fantasy of a resurrected corpse seeking revenge, and the second, "The Inhumanist," a darkly marvelous fantasy of a guardian spirit defending nature against human wantonness. Though "The Double Axe" is focused on the single thematic purpose of a poetic protest against the direction of the United States during and after World War II, it consists of two con- trasting halves. "The Love and the Hate" reverses the cliché that dead men tell no tales by having a corpse tell the tale of war as suicidal slaugh- ter; "The Inhumanist" provides a contrast not only to "The Love and the Hate" but also to the society which that first blade exposes and condemns. Jeffers employs in these two contrasting halves two different types of fantasy, the negative fantasy of abjection and the positive fantasy of mythopoeia, to achieve his intellectual purpose through intense emotive effect. As William Everson points out: "Political poetry speaks to the mind, certainly, but at its best it speaks through the mind to the passions. In spite of ourselves, hearing it, we are moved" (x). Jeffers combines in "The Love and the Hate" his political critique with Freudian analysis and supernatural horror to produce a negative fantasy of abjection. As T. E. Apter notes, this kind of fantasy, rather than building on the sense of wonder that C. N. Manlove emphasizes,1 "discovers and aggravates disintegration" and "is not a means of consolation and recovery but of registering losses and fears. Thus such fantasy is predom- inantly 'negative' in that it does not resolve problems but rather magnifies them" (6). And Julia Kristeva explains the controlling use of a corpse: "The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life. Abject. It is something rejected from which one does not part, from which one does not protect oneself as from</page><page sequence="2">196 Western American Literature an object" (4). For the half of the poem that must expose and condemn the society amidst which the reader lives and dies, negative fantasy serves Jeffers well by magnifying the social disintegration and linking it with the losses of the war and the personal fear of defilement. While Jeff ers centers "The Love and the Hate" on a dead man repre- senting a dead society that has not yet found its grave, he centers "The Inhumanist" on an old man, ageless and only partly human. As Hoult Gore is a political figure, the old man is a philosophical one. With his magic axe he has become the caretaker of the Gore Place, setting for both halves of "The Double Axe." Through him, Jcffers presents his philosophy of Inhumanism as a counter to the prevalent philosophies of the postwar United States. As the story moves toward its apocalypse, the reader realizes that the guardian is a caretaker for the planet, attempting to protect it from man but letting man nearly destroy himself through waging a third world war. The guardian meets a fugitive from the burning cities who declares: "This is the end of the world." The old man answers: "Of yours perhaps. / The mountains appear to be on their feet still / .... As for the human race, we could do without it; but it won't die." In "The Double Axe" Jeffcrs offers visions in each of its halves of what the guardian calls the "two remedies," death for humanity or life through Inhumanism. Jeffers uses negative horror fantasy to depict the first remedy, but positive mythopoeic fantasy to depict the hope of the second remedy. Here Jeffcrs employs what Manlove emphasizes about fantasy: "[I]n nothing is it perhaps so markedly constant as in its devotion to wonder at created things, and its profound sense that wonder is above almost everything else a spiritual good not to be lost" ( Impulse 1 56) . He also uses magic, which, like the old man figure, is a common clement in mythic fantasy, to counter- act the bleakness of the first half and emphasize the marvelous possibility of the second half. The wonder, the magic, and the guardian figure serve to reinforce Jeffers' mythopoeia which presents a new spiritual philosophy, one that can generate future life instead of nuclear destruction. Jeffers' critics have failed to give attention to "The Double Axe," and when they have attended to it fail to recognize the function of fantasy in formally tying Parts One and Two together. Jcffers' politics as presented in The Double Axe and Other Poems resulted in the book's repudiation by its publisher and burial by critics who uniformly denounced it.2 Such hostility has inhibited a proper assessment of Jeffers' contribution to American poetry and has contributed to "The Double Axe" being critically</page><page sequence="3">Patrick D. Murphy 1 97 neglected and allowed to remain out of print for nearly thirty years.3 In 1977 Liveright resurrected it, and it has received some critical attention since then, but criticism tends to focus either on its didactic content or psychobiographical implications while still failing to recognize that its stylistic elements, dominant among them its use of fantasy, are what dis- tinguish it as poetry rather than mere verse polemic or unconscious auto- biography.4 Among sympathetic critics these predilections and failure to treat the formal unity have led to a false treatment of the two halves of "The Double Axe" as separate poems.5 "The Double Axe" still awaits critical attention that will treat both its form and content simultaneously, and will recognize that the political and philosophical themes comprise the poem's two blades while fantasy comprises its helve. Part One of "The Double Axe," "The Love and the Hate," presents an openly Oedipal confrontation in which the son knows beforehand who he kills and who he inseminates. But this modern Oedipus, Hoult Gore, has already died before he acts out this tragedy, and in his resurrection combines the figures of Oedipus and Christ, becaming an avenging angel of death. Through the development of the narrative the reader ricochets between revulsion at the unreal horror of Hoult's resurrection and revolt against the real horror of the world which rendered him a corpse. Jeffers builds up the initial horror of Hoult's revivification in order to prepare the reader for an even more gruesome revulsion, which occurs when he realizes that the political and philosophical character of the United States consti- tutes the real horror because its warfare routinely produces millions of corpses just like Hoult. Jeffers emphasizes this turning of the tables by having Hoult consider it fantastic that he has been the only corpse to rise up for revenge: There are millions and millions, but as far as I know I am the only one That has come back. It's unbelievable ; how can they lie so still After being gypped and killed. . . . .... Think of the Stinking armies of semi-skeletons marching on Washington : here comes yourwah (6-7) The real horror, the cause for the hate, resides in the unreasonable wound of governments creating cannon fodder. In contrast, Jeffers presents Hoult's own patricidal violence and motherlust as basic and natural human psychological drives. The tragedy of the Oedipal triangle lies not in the son murdering the father, but in the father having first murdered the son by patriotically sending him off to war.</page><page sequence="4">198 Western American Literature Before Hoult murders his father to gain revenge and resecure his relationship with his mother, he must also murder his unfaithful mother's lover. The significance of this murder rests not in its execution but in the events of the night before when Hoult forces his mother to relinquish her love for the young man. Similarly, Hoult also forces her to relinquish her husband before Hoult shoots him. On the political level, the Earth mother must disown both the government and the war profiteers who traffic in death and destruction, while Hoult must destroy them to free the masses and free the Earth from their exploitation. These murders leave one bullet left in the rifle, which is reserved for the mother. She is found after a fire has swept the ranch, still in the house, "naked mourning a three weeks' corpse," Hoult's body finally at rest. She must also die as symbol, not of the entire Earth but of this specific country, because no life can come from the horror of the American way of death ; she must die as a person because of her infidelity, incest and social corruption. She says to the men who find her: ". . . we must be kind. / He melted into horror, his brain ran out, / Through his nostrils: how could someone long dead / Be alive from there down?" (51).G After admitting the consummation of the Oedipal rela- tionship and offering to lie down and service all the dead boys through "all the endless night / War after war," she kills herself, the "love" dying along with the "hate." No one can doubt Jeffers' purpose in forging the first blade of "The Double Axe" once the protagonist has declared: We must build gibbets On every mountain-peak and every high hill, All along the sky-line conspicuous gibbets, if any person Begins to say we have to save England or rescue France or avenge the Jews - take him up and hang him He is pimping for war. If he says democracy, Remember they pimped for war and they will again - take him up and hang him. Or if he says we must save Civilization: they said it: take them up and hang them. If they say, My country, Right or wrong - they are pimping for war, take them up and hang them. Higher than Haman. Hell, we'll have a fine orchard When the sun ripes the plums. (17-18) As Freud observed, echoing Goethe, at the end of Totem and Taboo: "In the beginning was the deed." And the deed of America sending Hoult off to have a hole blown through his side creates Hoult's need for language,</page><page sequence="5">Patrick D . Murphy 199 his need for the use of the word to explain the crime and to condemn his father, Bull Gore. The word of patriotism is made flesh in the corpse of Gore, who speaks his own words of rebuttal after the resurrection. Before, his father's word dominated, as the mother demonstrates in her accusa- tions against her husband: You sent him there, though I begged you on my knees. Meserole Island : Is that a place? He was only seventeen. I prayed to you and to him, but you'd hypnotized him" your insane talk About courage and honor. (10) But now Hoult has the last word as he parodies John 1 1 :25: "I am the resurrection and the death , ha?" Rather than a Prodigal figure, as Squires argues, Hoult is a clear inversion of the Christ myth.7 He had gone to do his father's bidding by fighting in the war, suffered death, and rose from the dead, but rather than rising to rejoin his father, he has risen to destroy him, combining the inversion of the Christ myth with the Titan myth. And like the earlier combination of Oedipus and Christ, in this combina- tion it is the pagan myth that proves stronger and more basic in driving the character forward. Obeying the father is self-destructive, while destroy- ing the father is regenerative. After exposing Bull Gore to the reader and condemning him, Hoult executes his father as both Laius and Uncle Sam by shooting him through the loins. In another mythic reversal, Hoult inflicts on this fisher king of the American waste land a final and fatal but utterly reasonable wound. There will be no shoring of the ruins of Gore Place. Through Hoult's will the word is made dead flesh in the form of Bull's slain body, itself filled with mythic implications. Throughout this first half of "The Double Axe," this mixture of psychoanalytic and mythic symbolism intertwines with the political role of the ghoulish hero to protect the poem from dead didacticism and to infuse it with poetic power. Let me indicate here a few of the major ele- ments which make "The Love and the Hate" succeed aesthetically as negative horror fantasy. Apter suggests: "The initial impact of fantasy is its deviation from the norm. The further and more fascinating impact of fantasy arises from its connection to the norm, from the way in which it highlights the instability, inconsistency or underlying preposterousness of the normal" (111). By the fourth page Hoult has announced that he has been killed and has returned from the grave; Jeffers does not spring this</page><page sequence="6">200 Western American Literature on the reader, but builds up to it, heightening the effect of the revelation. His mother observes that "he was cold and stiff in response," but attributes this to his shyness. Though she does not believe his announcement that he has returned from the grave, the reactions of the dogs and the Latin kitchen maid reinforce the reader's acceptance of his transformation. And this transformation marks the only "deviation from the norm" in the tale, demonstrating a Lovecraftian skill in the composing of this fantasy. As Lovecraft notes: Every energy must be bent toward the weaving of a frame of mind which shall make the story's single departure from nature seem credible - and in the weaving of this mood the utmost subtlety and verisimilitude is required. In every detail except the chosen marvel, the story should be accurately true to nature. (Mobley 119) Jeffers' care in description enhances the verisimilitude and heightens the impact of his "single departure." Along with this, the animals and the uneducated girl immediately recognize Hoult's transformation while the parents, out of education, pride, and love, deny it. Jeffers demonstrates a recognition of what Mobley summarizes, that "horror fiction requires a norm drawn from our everyday apprehension of natural form. Psycholo- gists have shown that people and animals most fear what is similar but discrepant" (119). Again and again Jeffers provides the characters with opportunities for accepting what the reader already recognizes: the truth of Hoult's claim. But acceptance of that claim opens the reader up to the possibility of accepting Hoult's political claims as well. The father never admits that Hoult is a corpse; his blindness contributes to his death because he cannot accept what such an admission would mean for his own conception of the normal world. The mother moves from refusal toward acceptance and as she does so recognizes the horrible nature of the normal. She finally accepts the reality of his death when Hoult has her pass her hand through the hole in his side; on the way out she scratches her hand on one of Hoult's ribs and becomes infected, enacting Kristeva's remark about the corpse being "death infecting life." Here Jeffers magnificently reverses the fable of Doubting Thomas. In drawing her hand back and believing, Hoult's mother gains, instead of everlasting life, everlasting death, becoming infected by Hoult's putrescent body, eucharist of the black mass of war- time destruction.8 The problem of belief versus disbelief is invoked from the first in "The Double Axe" through the use of fantasy, but within "The Love and the</page><page sequence="7">Patrick D. Murphy 201 Hate" it takes on a clearly religious-faith dimension as Jeffers repeatedly inverts the Christ myth to challenge the validity of Christianity, a com- ponent part of the horrific society which has sent Hoult to his grave. As if • the relationship between Hoult and his father, the parody of John 1 1 :25, and the Doubting Thomas episodes might prove insufficient, Jeffers reinforces these with an openly black mass Last Supper parody: Now it is comic. Take it in remembrance of me. This is my body That was broken for nothing. Drink it : this is my blood That was spilled for no need. Oh, yes : for victory : That rat-sucked hawk-egg. (38) During this scene, his mother in mad terror repeats: "Deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil, deliver us / From evil. . . ." At the center of the sacra- ment that signifies the ascendancy of the Son of God in Christian faith over God the Father, the mother mouths a line from The Lord's Prayer, which is directed to the Father, not the Son, but her effort at repudiation comes too late as she has already relinquished her husband to Hoult to be killed. She has no choice but to participate in the ascendancy of her son by consuming his body, which she does at the end in the consummation of Oedipal incest. She becomes first Houlťs confidante, then accomplice, and finally lover in her coupling with this avenging angel of death. The didactic anti- war propaganda of this first half remains virulent throughout, while the macabre effects blend and weave, building the con- trast of the unreal horror of the walking corpse and the real horror of the running sore of war. At first a seemingly incongruous marriage of con- flicting elements, the two actually integrate, realizing in extreme form Irwin's argument about the rhetoric of the impossible: . . the general principle of distancein fantasy is controlled by the fact that it is a demon- strational narrative dominated by intellectual persuasion" (76). And further, paralleling Everson's remark quoted earlier, Irwin states: "The persuasiveness by which a fantasist attempts to establish the possibility of his fictitious narrative is addressed to the intellect; the persuasiveness of the propagandist may work through the intellect, but its aim is the affec- tions" (78). Jeffers combines propaganda and fantasy to strike at the reader's mind at both the rational and irrational levels, consummating a relationship of intellectual and emotional revulsion. Reeling from this double impact of the horrific, the reader then enters the much altered world of "The Inhumanist."</page><page sequence="8">202 Western American Literature The prologue of "The Inhumanist" presents the old man who has become the caretaker of the Gore Place and it claims that "the pain, the hate and the love / Have left no ghost." This statement both indicates that the new narrative takes place in the future, beyond the events and composi- tion of "The Love and the Hate," and links the two stories geographically and thematically. But "Have left no ghost" comments ambiguously on the preceding story. Docs it mean that "time heals all wounds" and that the reader can shake off his revulsion bccausc the tragedy was a momentary one occurring in time of war? Or does it mean that even such horrific tragedies as the Hoult family disaster and the horror of World War II leave no lessons for man's development? Do the horrors lie forgotten and do men remain free to commit such folly again? Jeffcrs presents in the prologue only the possibility of solitude as a positive benefit of the postwar world, and so "The Inhumanist" begins on the mixed blessing of blankness and solitude. While "The Love and the Hate" is a single continuous section, Jeffcrs breaks up "The Inhumanist" into a prologue and fifty-two numbered sec- tions. It is not surprising, given the choice of fifty-two divisions, that section One invokes the seasonal cycles, establishing a mythic context for the old man in opposition to the brief linear chronology of "The Love and the Hate." The old man comments: "peace creeps out of war, war out of peace," tying himself to the larger cycles of society as well as to the earth's seasons and heightening the contrast between the short-lived struggle of the Gore family and the long-lived struggle of humanity toward maturity. Further enlarging the context for "The Inhumanist," section Two defends the existence of Jeffcrs' version of God, with the old man in his personal musing declaring the interconnectedncss of the universe: "One existence, one music, one organism, one life, one God." He goes on in the following few sections to attack anthropomorphic conceptions of God, concluding that "nothing. ... Is not alive." Jeffers then introduces the double-bladed axe, the key symbol for "The Inhumanist" and for "The Double Axe" as a whole: Cutting oak fence-posts, he stopped to whet his axe edges. He con- sidered the double-bladed axe: "In Crete, it was a god, and they named the labyrinth for it. That's long before the Greeks came; the lofty Greeks were still bushmen. It was a symbol of generation : the two lobes and the stiff helve: so was the Cross before they christened it. But this one can clip heads too. Grimly, grimly. A blade for the flesh, a blade for the spirit: and truth from lies." (54)</page><page sequence="9">Patrick Z). Murphy 203 Through the development of this symbol, Jeffcrs establishes the mythic- fantasy character of "The Inhumanist," embedding the axe within a complex web of sacred, symbolic, archetypal, and allusive significations. The pagan versus Christian aspect of the comparison, with the Christian clearly the weaker, connects "The Inhumanist" with the anti-Christian elements in "The Love and the Hate." The life/death twining of its generative and clipping capabilities not only calls up associations with the waxing and waning god myths in which the god-king is ritually slain on a seasonal basis, myths which include the Bull as a central figure, but also associates the axe with the cyclical time invoked in the beginning of "The Inhumanist." The Dionysian characterization of the axe may serve to shock the reader by heightening the contrast with Christianity and by reminding the reader of the destructive sexuality of "The Love and the Hate," while at the same time preparing the reader for the generative and destructive sexu- ality appearing later in the poem. Particularly through the sacred, arche- typal symbolism, Jeffers clearly places the old man's philosophizing in the context of re-establishing a religious relationship of man and universe that can go beyond the anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism of modern Christian humanism. Though "The Love and the Hate" is essentially a negative horror fantasy, it has significant elements of mythic fantasy insofar as it presents an adaptation and reversal of the Christian myth of Christ's death and resurrection and plays heavily on pagan myths. And while "The Inhu- manist" also has significant mythic fantasy characteristics of the same kind, it is primarily a mythopoeic fantasy, a "new invention." As Tymm, Zahorski, and Boyer define it, building on Cook's analysis in The Ordinary and the Fabulous: "[W]e arc concerned with three types of myth fantasy: retellings, modern adaptations, and new inventions. . . . The final category, new inventions, consists of talcs that might be analogous to traditional myths, but tell of completely different gods and events" (13-14). Because of its horrific character and adaptation of a pre-existent myth, "The Love and the Hate" follows the Lovccraftian dictum of verisimilitude in all of its other features except the one supernatural element. In contrast, the positive mythopoeic fantasy of "The Inhumanist" places more weight on the element of magic, centered on the hero and his axe, and the develop- ment of the hero as a mythic figure, the old man's transformation into an ageless guardian spirit. As Mobley argues, magic is a central feature of fantasy with two basic manifestations, "a power which imposes itself on</page><page sequence="10">204 Western American Literature men capriciously ; or it may be a power which can be utilized, induced, or controlled by man to his own purposes" (121). She further defines the second manifestation: In the second form personal or directed magic is a power called out by a gifted one. an initiate in the arts or discipline of magic usage, skilled in effective magic. His skill is the end of study, not luck, and he functions in special roles in the community. In fantasy fic- tion, his is most often the role of guide or tester, the arbiter of change and purveyor of new wisdom in the narrative. (121) Much of Moblcy's description applies to the old man, the guardian, who must battle both himself and the axe to become an inhumanist capable of surviving the apocalyptic end of human-centered civilization. The axe is double-bladed, a Janus-faced symbol of generation and death, protection and destruction, so the old man has to guide it to destroy purgatively rather than wantonly; he succeeds only after he has killed his human half. From that point on he dominates the axe, which is not his creation but some- thing with a life of its own which imposes itself on him, making him a standard bearer. The inhumanist and his axe, then, stand in direct opposi- tion to civilization and its technology : man creates modern weaponry, but never learns to control it, with the result that it is unleashed and destroys civilization, though it does not destroy humankind ; the old man does not create the axe, but he does learn to control it, and together they offer a way for the survival of humankind. The development of "The Inhumanist" narrative functions largely to provide illustrations and opportunities for the presentation of Jeffers5 Inhumanist philosophy. Within the story of the old man's struggle with the axe and mankind, and with the two halves within himself, Jeffers presents another story of familial jealousy, envy, rape, and murder. Here, instead of the Oedipal triangle, he depicts an Electra complex in which the daughter, Vere Harnish, murders her mother ; he adds a twist in that Vere has slept with her mother's lover and acts out of love for her lost father and jealousy of her mother. Jeffers uses the story to tie the second half of "The Double Axe" to the first and to tie the two generative lobes of male and female together in mutual corruption caused by the degeneracy of civilization. In a story that follows the Electra story, the old man is attacked by three thieves. The axe kills two of them and the old man captures the third, who turns out to be the ghost of his human half. Jeffers resurrects</page><page sequence="11">Patrick Z). Murphy 205 the myth of the Crucifixion from "The Love and the Hate" by having the ghost caught between two thieves. This story, which ends with the old man's beheading of the ghost, reinforces the argument Jeffers initiates in the early sections of "The Inhumanist": man must go beyond Christian humanism and create a new sacred philosophy. The old man becomes a Christ figure in the sense that the Crucifixion killed the human body enabling the god-soul to rise from the grave, while the old man's behead- ing of his human half enables the inhumanist spirit to rise from sleep refreshed at the end of the poem. But here the figuration ends as the old man serves neither to adapt Christian myth nor to parody it, but to go beyond Christian belief altogether. A few sections before the poem's end, Jeffers demonstrates that the inhumanist old man, while he must dissociate himself from civilization, must have compassion for the innocent. In section Forty-Five he sings the song "O future children" in which he shows compassion for those yet untainted and most succinctly presents his philosophy: Cruelty is dirt and ignorance, a muddy peasant Beating his horse. Ambition and power-lust Are for adolescents and defective persons. Moderate kindness Is oil on a crying wheel : use it. Mutual help Is necessary: use it when it is necessary. And as to love : make love when need drives. And as to love : love God. He is rock, earth and water, and the beasts and stars; and the night that contains them. And as to love : whoever loves or hates man is fooled in a mirror. (106) After this show of compassion the old man attempts to throw away the axe to relieve himself of the burden of responsibility for being the mes- senger of this philosophy and the observer of death and destruction, but the axe comes back to him. He has been chosen by its magic to fulfill a greater destiny than his individual life. This is itself a part of the Inhu- manist philosophy, that the individual participates in the greater destiny of the universe, but at some periphery, not the center. It is also a part of the mythopoeia of the poem, the creation of a larger-than-life mythic hero meeting his fate. After accepting the axe back he witnesses the destruction of the third world war from the mountain solitude of the Gore Place. The final section of "The Inhumanist" invokes the images of cycles which section One introduced, and the fire caused by nuclear warheads mimics the descrip-</page><page sequence="12">206 Western American Literature tion of fire which opened "The Love and the Hate." That first fire at the beginning of "The Double Axe" killed off the old vegetation and cleared the ground for new flowers: A fire a few years before had skinned the hills' faces, And Nature played one of her beautiful tricks; She planted them solidly with purple lupin, sheets of pure blossom From peak to base, so that they stood like archangels Above the shadow in the canyon, their purple shoulders In the blue sky. (3) At the end of "The Double Axe" human-made fire clears the ground for a new flourishing, and where the archangels of the opening once stood now stands the single "purveyor of new wisdom," the old man, in the "red dawn." While the flowers have gone "from peak to base," the story of "The Double Axe" has gone from base to peak in its presentation of the "two remedies" for humanity, the first depicted in "The Love and the Hate," the second in "The Inhumanist." While Robinson Jeffers was grappling with the problem of a new philosophy for humanity in the years between the writing of the two halves of "The Double Axe" ( 1944-1947) , C. G. Jung, struggling with the same problem, raised these questions: I put it to the enlightened rationalist: has his spiritual reduction led to the beneficial control of matter and spirit? ... we continue to ask: what have all our other cultural achievements led to? The fearful answer is there before our eyes: man has been delivered from no fear, a hideous nightmare lies upon the world. So far reason has failed lamentably, and the very thing that everybody wanted to avoid rolls on in ghastly progression. Man has achieved a wealth of useful gadgets, but, to offset that, he has torn open the abyss, and what will become of him now - where can he make a halt? (Wolfe 206-207) Jeffers in "The Double Axe" presents the abyss that has been opened and the devastation awaiting humanity in its depths ; he also presents an answer as to where man can make a halt, though he shows little faith in the possi- bility that civilization will listen to the lesson without first experiencing the disaster. The two halves of "The Double Axe" expose and propose, and Jeffers turns to different types of fantasy to accomplish these separate functions. He uses a negative horror fantasy in "The Love and the Hate" to expose and condemn modern civilization, focusing on fantasy's "con- nection to the norm" to highlight the "underlying preposterousness of the</page><page sequence="13">Patrick D . Murphy 207 norm." He uses positive mythopoeic fantasy with a good dose of magic in "The Inhumanist" to offer an alternative sacred philosophy presented by an "arbiter of change and purveyor of new wisdom in the narrative," and to suggest through the magic that greater forces work in the universe than man, forces which he can come to appreciate only through decentering himself. While referring to Apter and Mobley may provide arguments for Jeffers' choices of particular fantasy types in the two halves, it does not answer a more fundamental question: why does Jeffers choose fantasy as a framework at all? Perhaps the critic Gary Wolfe offers an answer: Fantasy, at least of the mythopoeic variety, arises when the domi- nant cultural attitude of a generation grows so narrow that it fails to account for, or to provide sufficient means for the expression of, any significant aspect of man's psychological or spiritual makeup. (205) To expose the bankruptcy of contemporary society, as he did in "The Love and the Hate," proved insufficient for Jeffers. His concern for humanity required him to provide a way out, the world of Inhumanism. But a new world cannot come into existence without a new myth to create it and to present the spiritual philosophy which must guide its growth: one blade to expose and a second to propose. 1 . Manlove defines fantasy as : " A fiction evoking wonder and containing a sub- stantial and irreducible element of supernatural or impossible worlds, beings or objects with which the mortal characters in the story or the readers become on at least partly familiar terms" ( Modern Fantasy 10). This definition serves as the basis for The Impulse of Fantasy Literature as well. 2. See Shebl and Zaller on the publishing controversy and Vardamis on the critical response to The Double Axe and Other Poems. 3. Most of the major works on Robinson Jeffers appeared prior to the republica- tion of The Double Axe and Other Poems and tend to slight it. Bennett devotes two paragraphs to its politics; Brophy only mentions "The Love and the Hate" in his Epilogue and fails to consider the world context in which that half of "The Double Axe" was written; Carpenter in Robinson Jefiers praises "The Inhumanist" and damns "The Love and the Hate," treating them as separate poems; Monjian only discusses "The Inhumanist" and it only in terms of Biblical intertextuality and Jeffers' philosophy; Squires briefly discusses "both halves but also treats them as separate poems. Of the major pre- 197 7 works, only Coffin's treats both halves of "The Double Axe" with any sustained analysis, recognizing it as a single poem ( 173-184) . 4. Carpenter treats the two halves still as separate poems and comments that "The Love and the Hate" "on rereading, seems almost as bad as when first published . . . remains unbelievable and repulsive" ("Robinson Jeffers" 92), with the latter</page><page sequence="14">208 Western American Literature phrase indicating his refusal to consider it as horror fantasy; Nolte praises "The Double Axe" but sees no need to discuss it, treating only the short poems of The Double Axe and Other Poems', Zaller only discusses ''The Love and the Hate," but at least gives it extended analysis, which is marred by his reductionist Freudianism, and admits that it is, at least, ''partly supernatural" (185-194). 5. In addition to Brophy, Carpenter, Monjian, Squires, and Zaller, the Fore- word and Afterword to the 1977 edition of The Double Axe and Other Poems con- tribute to the critical error of separating the two halves of the poem. Everson states: "The Double Axe is divided into three parts. The title poem itself is made up of two related but markedly distinct narratives, followed by a section of shorter poems. The first of the narratives and the short poems go together" (xvi). This is true only in terms of the chronology of the composition, but even Jeffers' Preface indicates that "The Double Axe" is a single poem in two parts, as the layout of the book demon- strates. Hotchkiss accepts Everson's divisions and contributes to the separation by discussing only "The Inhumanist." 6. Zaller fails to interpret this line, perhaps because it contradicts his claim that "the son renounces Oedipal primacy. In the end, Hoult wishes only to return to infancy and beyond, a precognitive, prenatal state" (192), whereas these lines coupled with her earlier remark that "His awful fever fell asleep in my arms" and the following remarks that she will "lie down" with other dead soldiers imply the Oedipal consummation. 7. In Chapter One, "The Destroying Prodigal," Squires advances this Biblical analogy as a key figure running throughout Jeffers' work; without disputing his gen- eral theory, I disagree with its application to Hoult. Coffin's analysis that Hoult "regards himself as a sort of perverse Christ" (174) and that Jeffers develops him as such, particularly in the Doubting Thomas and Last Supper parodies, as well as his correlations of such scenes in the first half and the second, is a much more fruitful figuration (174-180). 8. Zaller emphasizes the physical evidence that convinces Hoult's mother, Reine, that he is really dead, but the Doubting Thomas episode, more than providing physical proof, enables Hoult to infect her by piercing her flesh with a rib, fore- shadowing another piercing of her flesh in the event of incest, as well as letting Jeffers reinforce the Christ inversion figuration (Zaller 187-190, see fn. 6).
