<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTI SINTONEN WHY QUESTIONS, AND WHY JUST WHY-QUESTIONS? 1. TOWARDS A THEORY OF EXPLANATION In a review of one of the recent comprehensive anthologies on explan ation, namely Kitcher and Salmon (1989), Noretta Koertge complained that the current philosophical contributions of explanation are not faulty (or mainly or mostly faulty) because they fail to square with the various type of counterexamples citing flagpoles, barometers, mayors with paresis, and the like. Rather, they are inadequate because they do not offer general theories of explanation - there is an "absence of systematic philosophical generalisations in which the competing explications or models of explan ation play a central role" (Koertge 1992, 86). Her suggestion is that we should reverse the order of investigation and ask what problems a theory of scientific explanation can reasonably be expected to solve. Although much has happened since this verdict was given it still is by and large valid. Consequently, instead of starting with some preferred precise model of explanation, this paper tries to deal with Koertge's chal lenge. The paper does suggest a specific proposal, though. This is the question-answer proposal which derives from R. G. Collingwood. As Koertge suggests this interrogative model of inquiry is not a complement to other theories of explanation, most notably the causalist or ontic con ception, or the unificationist conception which has emerged in the past two decades, but a third alternative. But where she thinks it is an alternative theory about the aims of science I would suggest that it is rather an um brella idea which is flexible enough to accommodate a number of more precise notions. Very roughly, the question-answer idea ramifies from the logic of questions and its applications to ideas using "ordinary language" constraints to illuminate what explanations or explaining is. One reason why we need questions and answers is that this format is the best way to systematise the insights into the competing models of explanation. Another reason comes from the changing scene in the study of science. With the emergence of historical case studies and sociologically oriented science studies it is no longer possible to resist the contextualist demand t4 Synthese 120: 125-135, 1999. W% ? 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">126 MATTI SINTONEN that philosophy of science should also take actual scientific practice seri ously. This paper argues that the interrogative model moves in this spirit: the working scientist's own philosophy of science is not deductivisim or inductivism or even hypothetico-deductivism but interrogationism. What matters in science is ability to phrase new questions and to refine old ones to meet new standards of precision as well as the ability to find answers to these questions. 2. ISSUES: CAUSATION, OBJECTIVITY, UNITARIANISM So what are the problems we are supposed to solve? What are the intended applications of a theory of explanation? One criterion for adequacy is that a theory of explanation should tell what sort of entities explanations are: what sets explanations apart from other entities, in general? Similarly, it should tell us what specifically scientific explanations are. And secondly, it should give some ways of grading explanations and scientific explana tions as good or better - or even ideal. These criteria were clearly behind Hempel's metascientific strictures and the motivation behind "making things expected". This motivation was geared to distinguishing between psychological and anthropomorphic comfort, "feeling of empathie famili arity" from theoretical understanding which is an objective affair. This focuses on laws and nomic expectedness. To capture the genuinely sci entific mode of understanding, on the level of conceptual hygiene required by logical empiricism, reference to persons, scientific communities, and other contextual features of inquiry and language use had to be removed. From this we move to the later refinements of the informational or epistemic models to the causalist or ontic views and to the unification ist view proposed by Michael Friedman and Philip Kitcher. Whereas the former view abandons the ban on causation the latter one falls squarely in the (Hempelian) camp of those who try to keep issues of explanation and causation separate. I shall not go into the technical details of these discussions here but rather proceed to what I see as the main issues. First, there is the relation ship between causation and explanation. Is it possible to give an explicate of the notion of explanation, everyday or scientific, without bringing in the notion of cause? Secondly, there is the issue over objectivity and pragmat ics. Is explanation a two place relationship between sentences, statements or propositions which stand for events, processes, states of affairs or facts, or do explanation make ineliminable reference to persons, contexts, tradi tions and the like? Third, there is the unitarism vs. pluralism controversy. The unitarists suggest that there is some one kind of property or relation</page><page sequence="3">WHY QUESTIONS, AND WHY JUST WHY-QUESTIONS? 127 ship between the chosen relata which captures the relevant concept across the varied applications, be this nomic expectedness, causal relevance, uni fication, or something else. The pluralists rather doubt this: explanations split into kinds across various possible divides. This gives rise to the worry about nominalism: what makes all these explanations explanations, then? 3. WHY QUESTIONS? So why questions? My brief suggestion is that questions are needed in the theory of explanation because it is the best overall framework within which the various competing views can be cast. It seems quite natural to think that all three approaches can be cast in the erotetic or interrogative mode, the crucial differentials residing in what counts as legitimate questions and admissible answers Furthermore, it has some philosophical virtues which the others lack, for it connects specifically scientific explanation with explanation in gen eral, and comes some way towards meeting the challenge of science studies whereas positivistically inspired theories of explanation leave some of the most pertinent issues untouched. Most importantly, questions and answers are the currency of daily speech acts. And since speech acts are actions, episodes of explaining, understood as episodes of answering, they can be immersed in our manifest image, of ourselves. And it is clear that good scientific explanations are a species of good everyday explanations. Questions and answers are deeply entrenched in our cognitive capa city. To appreciate this, consider an interesting feature in Quine's jungle linguistics and in the theory of radical interpretation. The program is one of the most extensively discussed philosophical programs in the analytic philosophy of this century. However, it is seldom realized that all radical interpretation or indeed all interpretation harbours a still more fundamental commitment, a commitment to the method of questions and answers. The entire enterprise only makes sense if both the jungle linguist and the in formant have two crucial abilities. They must be able to identify some of each other's utterances as questions and some as answers, that is, as spe cific types of speech acts. They must also be able to identify the contents of the speech acts, that is, what the content of a specific speech act is. There are also further virtues in the interrogative proposal. It provides a plausible solution to the question about the ontology of explanations (see Achinstein (1983) for the background). Are they inferences, arguments, singular descriptions, lists of statistically relevant properties, ideal explan atory texts, or whatnot? On this view explanations are answers, but apart from the extremely weak procedural constraints on when an answer is of</page><page sequence="4">128 MATTI SINTONEN the right kind, and when it is a good one and satisfies the questioner, it gives up the idea that there is a unitary and interesting concept which captures all possible explanatory answers and only them. This is disappointing but does open the doors for more detailed models, based on particular modes of understanding and specific contexts. Explanations therefore are a family of concepts tied together by the rather loose constraints on the question answer relationship. The conceptual edge obtained is that this analysis first locates explanations in the context of inquirers pursuing their objectives in specific settings, and only then gives more detailed analyses of what prop erties the appropriate answers must have. Its answer to the unificationist vs. pluralist issue is: both. 4. THE PROCESS OF INQUIRY The interrogative idea also has an answer to Koertge's demand for elucidat ing what a theory of explanation should contain, for it fills the gap between actual research processes and the finished research reports presented with the benefit of hindsight. But how is the gap bridged? Scientists' value questions which, if answered, would further under standing. Since understanding is worth having - indeed only possible - if the phenomena to be explained can be related to going concerns, a crucial first step is to identify good research questions. This is built into the interrogative proposal, for here the inquirer starts from some big initial questions and then proceeds to answer them by help of small operational questions. This duality brings down to earth the metaphor that empirical inquiry is putting questions to nature. There are the big initial questions which define the aim of a local inquiry, and small questions which serve to solicit information needed in achieving the goal. Important work in this direction has been done by, among others, Hintikka. The model also meets another desideratum which previous "logical" models have hardly even recognised, viz. that it construes the search for explanations as a process which, by representing inquiry as a step-by step procedure, captures the dynamics of theory building. The demand for dynamics has been voiced by the historicist in particular, but the in terrogative proposal suggests that there is a strategy behind the procedure. Theories are not conceived with full details at the outset, but must rather be developed from vague initial hunches. It turns out, also, that this nurturing involves two sides. On one hand new questions are derived from the vague initial questions. As Wisniewski (1995) in particular has shown, an important part of the erotetic proposal is to analyse how sound questions arise and how declarative sentences</page><page sequence="5">WHY QUESTIONS, AND WHY JUST WHY-QUESTIONS? 129 obtained during a process of inquiry are made more precise. This has two important consequences for the theory of explanation. One objection to the interrogative proposal has been that erotetic logic cannot help us to un derstand explanations because why-questions do not have any interesting logic (see Sintonen 1989). They do not present the answerer with specific alternatives as why-questions and yes-no questions do. But Wisniewski's suggestion shows that there is an indirect way, through a process of nar rowing down the ill-defined set of answers to why-questions, and through turning them into finite which-questions. Another consequence concerns what can be called Bromberger's programme (see Sintonen 1996). Wesley Salmon (1989) has criticised Bromberger's early question-theoretic ideas (reprinted in Bromberger 1991) for being overly linguistic. The objection is that the tools of ordinary language philosophy are too blunt to cut through the tough knots of spe cifically scientific explanations. However, although Bromberger's details may not be sufficiently explicit, he got the spirit right: there is no way of securing, e.g., explanatory relevance but through the question-answer relationship. And this notion gets its content from ordinary language! The interrogative view also helps us to appreciate the recent recovery of the heuristic and logic of discovery. It has been objected that the generation of new ideas and specific hypotheses which can be put to Nature is not a matter of logical procedure, but guess and luck, because there simply can be no logical way of having ideas. Consequently these questions have been left for psychologists of creative thinking and, perhaps, historians of sci ence. To make this idea plausible I will (in Section 9 below) argue that the weak logic of questions and question-answer sequences must be backed up with a rich notion of a theory. Theories, essentially, are devices which take vague hunches as inputs and well-defined proposals as outputs. This is also why unification through a parsimonious set of argument patterns as well as coherence emerge as desiderata for explanation (see Kitcher 1989; Thagard 1989). 5. OBJECTIVITY AND PRAGMATICS Let us return to the issue of objectivity. There have been pragmatic ac counts which have started with the conditions under which a claim "S explained to H why g" are true. Now the problem with the question answer-idea was that it seems too excessively pragmatic and anthropo morphic, precisely because what counts as an illuminating answer to one individual counts as little to another. And if answerhood is an anthropo morphic affair we come very close to the position embraced by Michael</page><page sequence="6">130 MATTI SINTONEN Scriven (1975, 4), namely, that the notion of explanation owes its content to subjective and psychological factors. This view is precisely what the covering law paradigm was opposed to: the goals of theoretical explanation are too noble to leave to rhetoricians and their tricks. I think Hempel and his early pragmatic critics like Michael Scriven (but not Bromberger) laboured under the misleading notion that pragmatic equals anthropomorphic and subjective. Explanation is a contextual affair, but objectivity and pragmatics are not necessary opposed to each other. Already Hempel admitted that not everything needed for a full explan ation need be mentioned if there is reason to think that the details can in principle be filled in. But equally importantly in the several models in which explanation is viewed as a dynamic process of adding information to knowledge situations already available there is no damaging reference to psychological or anthropological idiosyncrasies. All we need are rational agents. There is a sense in which explanation is an anthropomorphic pleasure. Phenomenologists may be right in that only humans are capable of raising why- (and how-) questions which go beyond purely descriptive accounts. But this reference to anthropomorphism carries no commitment to idio syncratic pleasures. If we are to believe evolutionary epistemologists, the craving for unification is a result of the evolutionary edge a unified or parsimonious mode of representation gives its carrier. But from this it does not follow that there are no universal truths about what unification is. The same is true of explanations geared to nomic expectedness. Rela tivizing improvement of knowledge in this sense, i.e., increase in nomic expectedness, can be captured by such models as G?rdenfors (1980). The question-answer-perspective makes it also possible to incorporate the two dimensions in which explanations are embedded in larger context, i.e., in dialogue with fellow inquirers ("social interaction") and dialogue with nature ("causal interaction"). Inquiry is putting questions to nature, and both observations and experiments can be viewed in this light. But equally well, inquirers are not solitary Robinsons but need fellow inquirers to communicate with, and larger social contexts to make this activity mean ingful and possible. This is especially true of explanation where indeed the knowledge and interests of the potential consumer of the explanations is ineliminable. Making the two dimensions antagonistic opponents to one another has resulted in constant confusion. Realising that both are needed is also important for science studies. Interpreting nature in fact presupposes the two separate dimensions of social and causal interaction, as forerunners of this idea from Francis Bacon to Charles Sanders Peirce have made clear.</page><page sequence="7">WHY QUESTIONS, AND WHY JUST WHY-QUESTIONS? 131 6. RELEVANCE One perennial topic in the theory of explanation is the failures of relevance. To be successful in promoting cognitive goals questions and answers must be to the point, relevant to the issues in question. An explanation has a topic and comments on it. The topic is, ceteris paribus, expressed in the presupposition of a question sentence. Thus, the topic of the why-question "Why ET is E. Now, if someone putatively answers that question but beats around the bush and tells nothing relevant for E, or tells something that is not relevant for E, her or his answer is partly or totally irrelevant to the topic, and hence commits the conversational sin of misleading the interlocutor. Questions are precisely the means of focusing on a particular issue, and of making important contrasts. To put it metaphorically, ques tions are cognitive pegs in which relevant background knowledge can be hung. The syntactic and semantic mould of the tradition of logical reconstruc tion therefore harbours difficulties which can be superseded by a dynamic model of questions and answers. Now to be relevant for a question one must know what the question is, and what answers are potential answers to precisely this question. This means that the issue of relevance splits into to two sub-issues, one about the identity of questions, another one about the relationship between questions and answers. Let us start with the question over the identity of questions. The traditional approach is to pick out a description of an event, fact, or gen eralisation and then go into the conditions under which a set of sentences constitutes an explanation of it. However, this approach bypasses the entire issue of exactly what the question is, as well as how it is motivated. The question-answer point of view suggests that there always is more to a question than meets the ear, and if an answer is not to be just an answer of any kind but also relevant to the particular local aim, it must respect the pragmatic riders - contrast classes etc. - below the surface. There is an im plicit assumption in, e.g., Hempel's model that a question-sentence alone, once it has left the mouth of the explainee-querier, is enough to identify an explanandum. But if in fact deciphering strategies and background know ledge are needed to find out exactly what is supposed to be explained, and a theory of explanation worth the attention of a historian of science must look different from what we have now. This is not just a result of the need to secure continuity of reference and predication (see Margolis 1993, 1995 and forthcoming) but a need to appreciate the explanatory commitments of earlier theories. All these testify to the need of a hermeneutics of science.</page><page sequence="8">132 MATTI SINTONEN 7. THE QUESTION-ANSWER RELATIONSHIP We can fully sympathise with Salmon's concern about the so-called inter rogative approaches, namely, that the pragmatics of explanation is not the full story. But it is crucial to realize that the interrogative proposal is not committed to naive ordinary language philosophy. Rather it leans on the observation that all knowledge seeking, including seeking of explanatory knowledge, has a question-answer structure, and that questions impose structure on admissible answers, Hempel and Oppenheim opened their classic article - and a new chapter in the history of the topic - with an interrogative gambit. But although they stated that explaining phenomena is tantamount to answering why-questions, neither their analysandum nor analysans developed the idea. This is a pity, for the basic idea of questions and answers contains a number of possibilities. For one, an explanation seeking question arises, very roughly, when something P is discovered that does not "fit in". Such a discovery causes unease or curiosity, and gives rise to a why-question "Why PV (or "How PV) which in turn initiates a search for an answer. Secondly, what fitting in is is contextual. It can be a phenomenon for which the inquirer does not have a ready label, or which is unexpected or unnatural or whatever, relative to what she or he knows (or believes). Nevertheless, although explanations do come in all sizes and shapes, there might be interesting generalisations to be unveiled about the rela tionship between the question and a good, better, or satisfactory answer. On the interrogative idea, although what counts as a satisfactory answer depends on the tenacity of the inquirer /, on what / happens to know, and on what questions are available in the scientific and cultural context anyway. Yet such pragmatic dependence makes no reference to anything idiosyncratic. In an important sense, then, the interrogative idea continues the research programme of logical analyses of which Hempel's model was one outcome. Can anything more be said about satisfactory answers on this general level? I suspect that there is no context-free and illuminating general char acterisation to cover all possible explanatory tasks. Some explanations fit the original Hempelian epistemic format in that they require laws and ini tial conditions sufficient to make the explanandum phenomenon expected - either with certainty, high probability or at least some probability. How ever, some explanations - descriptions of stranded or isolated phenomena - fit an entirely different pattern, for they require an answer which enables / to pigeonhole them in a certain category, or in general, which enable / to unite the phenomenon to other phenomena.</page><page sequence="9">WHY QUESTIONS, AND WHY JUST WHY-QUESTIONS? 133 It seems to me that one logical/pragmatic divide runs here, and that there are distinct types of explanation. And I consider it a great merit of the interrogative idea that the question-answer relationship is formulated on a level which does not commit us to any specific mode of explanation as the only possible one. The general question-answer-relationship is valid in all, but can be cashed out in different terms, as answers which give more expectedness, display necessity, or specify mechanisms. 8. THEORIES - HOW QUESTIONS ARISE My final observation is that to get a workable notion of explanation we need to see how questions emerge from a background. The reason is very simple. To be able to delineate the set of potential answers, answers that can even be regarded as candidates for an explanation, we must know what sort of constraints it has. And to be able to assess the merits of a partic ular answer we need to know what this question was. This was, I think, one of Brombergers's concerns. All interrogative construals start with the assumption that questions arise from a structured form of curiosity. Indeed, as Collingwood (1939, 30-1) observed, the "principle that a body of knowledge consists not of 'propositions', 'statements', 'judge ments' or whatever name logicians used in order to denote assertive acts of thought" is positively misleading. Knowledge consists, namely, of pro positions "together with the questions they are meant to answer; and that a logic in which the answers are attended to and the questions neglected is a false logic". Knowledge, then, comes from a combination of knowledge and ignor ance. Bromberger acknowledged this by writing that ignorance is not one big undifferentiated glob, one huge unstructured nothingness. Although a scientist may be in a "predicament" with respect to a proposition de scribing a phenomenon, her background knowledge imposes constraints on admissible answers. It is here that the resources of the interrogative view come to full view. In the review article to which I referred in the beginning, Noretta Koertge notes a difficulty about the logic of why-questions, viz., that they do not as such restrict the range of potential answers. The problem is that this creates a gap between the proximate aim of scientific inquiry, "answering quite specific questions", and the ultimate aim of understanding everything. How is it possible that piecemeal local tinkering leads to an increase in global understanding? The clue to this is obvious, as she puts it. I quote: "Requests for explanation arise within a knowledge system and are often prompted by</page><page sequence="10">134 MATTI SINTONEN objective inadequacies of that system, such as inconsistencies or gaps. So we don't need to invoke pragmatic interests to account for many of the questions which trigger scientific inquiry. In order to repair the flaws within the system we generally have to expand it. We can now start to account for the relative connectedness of mature science without relying too strongly on a telos such as unification or ideal explanatory text". I think Koertge is completely right here. Once the interrogative per spective is embedded in a rich notion of theory the impetus for expanding and revising the network comes from within, not simply from outward observations and experimental results. Furthermore, once we see the nature of a theory/driven question-answer procedure in this light, it also becomes obvious that not all explanations are answers to why-questions. Depend ing on the type of inquiry at hand they could be how-questions, how possible-questions, what-questions, or the like.
