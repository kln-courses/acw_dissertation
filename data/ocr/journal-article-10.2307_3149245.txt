<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sources of Israel's Religious Ideas. In his new book on The Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia, Professor A. H. Sayce, of Oxford University, summing up the contri- bution of the Egyptians to religious thought, says: They were the inventors of religious ideas. We owe to them the chief molds into which religious thought has since been thrown. The doctrines of emanation, of a trinity wherein one God manifests himself in three persons, of absolute thought as the underlying and permanent sub- stance of all things, all go back to the priestly philosophers of Egypt. Gnosticism and Alexandrianism, the speculations of Christian meta- physic and the philosophy of Hegel, have their roots in the valley of the Nile. On the much-discussed question as to the Babylonian origin of Hebrew religious ideas Professor Sayce remarks: The Babylonian was judged in this life and not in the next. It is usually the fashion to ascribe this concentration of religion upon the present world, with its repellent views of Hades and limitations of divine rewards and punish- ments to this life, to the inherent peculiarities of the Semitic mind. But for this there is no justification. There is nothing in the Semitic mind which would necessitate such a theological system. It is not among the nomads of Arabia that we find anything corresponding with the Babylonian idea of Hades and the conceptions associated with it. The idea was, in fact, of Babylonian origin. If the Hebrew Sheol resembles the Hades of Babylonia, or the Hebrew conception of rewards and punishments is like that of the Assyrians and Babylonians, it is because the Hebrew beliefs were derived from the civilization of the Euphrates. In a similar strain Professor Sayce continues in another connection: The Babylonian temple closely resembled the temple of Solomon.</page><page sequence="2">476 THE BIBLICAL WORLD That, too, had its two courts, its chambers for the priests, its sanctuary, and its Holy of Holies. Both alike were externally mere rectangular boxes, without architectural beauty or variety of design. It was only in the possession of a tower that the Babylonian temple differed from the Israelite. They agreed even in the details of their furniture. The two altars of the Babylonian sanctuary are found again in the temple of Jerusalem; so too are the mercy-seat and the table of shewbread. Even the bronze "sea" of Solomon, with its twelve oxen, is at last accounted for; it was modeled after a Babylonian original, and goes back to the cosmological ideas which had their source in Eridu. Yet more striking are the twin pillars that flanked the gateway of the court, remains of which have been found both at Nippur and at Tello. They are exactly parallel to the twin pillars which Solomon set up " in the porch of the temple," and which he named Yakin and Boaz. In these again we may find vestiges of a belief which had its roots in the theology of Eridu. There was the same similarity also between the Babylonian rituals and the Mosaic law; the priesthood, moreover, was established on the same lines, and the prophets and seers of Israel have their analogues in those of Chaldaea. The religious law and ritual of the Hebrews look back, like their calendar, to the banks of the Euphrates. The anthropomorphism of Semitic Babylonia is reflected in the anthropo- morphism of the Israelites. The sense of sin and of the overwhelming power of the deity, the efficacy of penitence and the necessity of a mediator, are common to both Babylonia and Israel. Hence it is that the penitential psalms of the Babylonian ritual bear so striking a resemblance to the psalms of the Old Testament; hence, too, the individual element and the deep spirituality that characterize them. Israel was indebted to Babylonia for something more than the seeds of a merely material civilization.</page></plain_text>
