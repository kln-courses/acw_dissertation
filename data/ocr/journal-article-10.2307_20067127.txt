<plain_text><page sequence="1">AVIGDOR W. G. POSEO On Physiognomic Communication in Bernini Even as an adolescent, Gian Lorenzo Bernini was acclaimed as one of the great artists of his time. Everyone who has written about his sculptures has dwelt on their extraordi nary expressiveness1 but the works have seldom been consid ered in the light of contemporary notions of human expres sion, particularly the revival of the ancient theory of physiognomic typology. In drawing upon this tradition Bernini referred to its two complementary aspects: the diagnostic sig nificance ascribed to the morphology of human faces and the communication of emotions by means of the dynamic mimicry of the features. The impact of these modes of representation is evident in the admirable vividness of his portraits and also in the conceptual meaning conveyed by the faces in some of his other sculptures. Interpretation of what these works were meant to communicate must refer to their cultural back ground. Some Literary Sources Bernini's early training under his father Pietro, also a sculptor, and his immediate success among the highest lev els of Roman society presumably left the young prodigy little time for general literary studies. In maturity he referred only to pious writings which he perused even when travelling.2 How ever, apart from copying the remains of antique sculptures, an essential part of their professional training, artists were expected to familiarize themselves with the cultural legacy which set the prevailing aesthetic standards. From contacts with his humanistic mentors Bernini would have gleaned some literary intelligence, supplemented by texts that might be use ful for his work. Among the classics which were then recom mended to artists were the writings of Aristotle, including the Physiognomonica (now considered to be the work of an anonymous third century BC author).3 Being expected to endow his imagery with sophisticated conceptual meanings, Bernini would have consulted the available iconography man uals where illustrations were sometimes more instructive than the text. Such were the repertory of allegorical motifs in the Emblemata and Cartari's Le imagini where themes of ancient art are presented as potential prototypes of artistic invenzioni.4 However, the most useful handbook would have been the then recently published Cesare Ripa's Iconolog?a which the author described as "a work necessary to poets, painters and sculp tors who depict the virtues and vices and human affections and passions".5 The original edition of 1593 was in subse quent versions enriched by numerous woodcuts, most of them showing personifications bearing appropriate attributes or 161</page><page sequence="2">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ accompanied by emblematic animals whose symbolical sig nificance is in many cases explained by references to Aristo tle's Historia Animalium. In catering to his patrons' intellectual fashions Bernini would have also developed some interest in Egyptology, particularly hieroglyphs, then believed to be an archaic mode of non-verbal communication by which the ancient priests transmitted their occult secrets.6 The trend owed much the pseudo-Egyptological illustrations of the famous allegoric romance Hypnerotomachia Poliphili from which many Renaissance painters drew their motifs.7 To enrich the expressiveness of his figurai works Bernini may have acquainted himself with some texts on human charac terology.8 He was perhaps attracted to the subject by a special chapter on physiognomy in Pomponius Gauricus's treatise On Sculpture9 and perhaps also the commentary by Luca Gauri co, Pomponius's brother.10 In pursuing the subject Bernini would discover the most influential of the humanistic treatises on physiognomy, Giovanni Battista Delia Porta's De Humana Physiognomia originally published in 1586 but in Bernini's time also accessible in an Italian version titled Delia Fisiono m?a dell'HuomoV In describing the variety of human types Delia Porta clas sifies human features according to their similarity to certain animals, claiming that a man's resemblance to an animal indi cates that he shares its behavioural habits. For instance a indi vidual's similarity to a lion would indicate an ardent personali ty, resemblance to a hare would show that the person is easily frightened, a likeness to a cock stands for liberality, while canine traits suggest avarice, etc. The diagnostic affinities are illustrated by paradigmatic representations of human types often sketched after portraits of historical personages, con fronted by images of animals which are said to have been imi tated from life. An astute observer such as the young Gian Lorenzo would perhaps note that the man-animal compar isons may also be understood in reverse, that is certain beasts not only resemble human beings but implicitly may also share human sensibilities. The result may be seen in the expressive ness of his human figures and in the emotions conveyed by the animal sculptures. The Tormented She-Goat Bernini's precocious reference to the contemporary view of beasts as sentient creatures is manifest in a juvenile sculp tural group known as The Goat Amalthea with Infant Jupiter and a Young Satyr [Fig. 1].12 Since this work is not mentioned by the early biographers the attribution was made only by modern scholars who, after some hesitation, dated it to about 162 1) G.-L. Bernini, ?The Goat Amalthea with Infant Jupiter and a Young Satyr?, 1614, marble. Rome, Galleria Borghese. 1614-1615 or earlier. The technical virtuosity of the adolescent sculptor particularly the expressive rendering of the she-goat, may have been intended to imitate or perhaps even to be passed off as a Hellenistic work. Whatever the case may be, viewers would compare the goat suckling the two infants to the celebrated Etruscan She-wolf which in the fifteenth century was combined with two children representing Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, who according to legend were nursed by a wolf.13 However unlike the antique She-wolf which since the Renaissance was hailed as the sym bol of Rome, the meaning of Bernini's work is not altogether explicit. The title by which the marble group is known refers to a relatively little-known story from classical mythology. Amalthea was a wild she-goat chosen by Mother Earth to</page><page sequence="3">ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI nurse the infant Jupiter, whom the goat raised together with Pan. In gratitude for her services Jupiter later transformed one of the goat's horns into a magic cornucopia which was always full with whatever food one desired.14 The horn became a common symbol of abundance,15 Ripa, for instance, adopt ed it as an attribute of the fertility of Italy as well as of Europe [Fig. 30].16 The broken-off horn of Bernini's goat suggests that the marble group may be related to the legend but one won ders why the supposedly wild goat wears an elaborate collar from which a small bell dangles. The two infants also present some problems. The young Jupiter wears a crown of ivy which, Ripa says, is an attribute of the libido that characterizes the wine god.17 The other infant who represents the satyr Pan, drinks from a shell instead of suckling the goat. His pose and delighted smile suggest that he may be tasting wine rather than goat's milk. These incongruities have aroused some doubts concerning the group's meaning. Among others it has been noted that in the original payment for the sculpture it is called a "capretta e baco" (she-goat and Bacchus) while the German artist Joachim von Sandrart (who lived in Rome from 1630) describes the infants as "due pueri bacchantes" (two infant bacchants).18 Since Amalthea is not specifically men tioned, the broken horn by which the goat is now identified, may at that time have been whole. In a nineteenth century inventory the sculpture was still described as "the infant Bac chus crowned with ivy, milking a she-goat and a little satyr drinking milk from a cup".19 The scene could thus be under stood to represent the infancy of Bacchus, who according to a Greek legend cited by Virgil was raised and cherished by nymphs in a mountain cave.20 The she-goat could simply be an allusion to the way human infants might be nourished in the wilderness. Since this is not quite satisfactory one is inclined to look for a better explanation. Whatever her allegorical meaning, the goat does not behave as a she-goat is supposed to. Goats offer their udders to their kids standing on their feet, while this goat reclines. The pose was perhaps adopted for technical reasons,21 but one wonders why instead of tenderly watching the young as suckling gcats often do, this one stretches out her long neck and raises her head in what looks like a painful expression of inner torment. Because it is so patently incompatible with the mythological theme assigned to the group, the she-goat's expression seems to be crucial to the work's meaning. Classi cal artists, as we know, seldom represented animal emotions and mournful expressions are usually seen only in human fig ures. The motif of a head violently thrown back with uplifted eyes and open mouth occurs in the depiction of ecstatic Bac chic rites and in tragic themes. Bernini seems to have adapt ed the pathetic pose of the she-goat from that of the dying 2) G.-L. Bernini, ?Bust of Laocoon? (copy after the Antique), 1613-1615 (?), marble. Rome, Galleria Spada. father in the Laocoon group which since its discovery had been one of the most admired antique sculptures in Rome.22 His interest in the tormented Trojan priest is evidenced by a free copy of the head which the young artist may have carved as part of his vocational apprenticeship [Fig. 2].23 Ital ian artists often imitated the dramatic effect of the Hellenistic group. Still, adaptation of the pathetic human expression to a goat was decidedly unusual. The innovation may perhaps be explained by Bernini's awareness of the concept of behav ioural affinities of men and animals expounded in Delia Porta's treatise on comparative physiognomy. The young sculptor would not require an illustration showing what a goat looks like but he would be interested in the interpretation of its behavioural traits. The text distinguishes between a male 163</page><page sequence="4">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 3) ?Allegory of 'Silliness that is Folly'? (Stupidita' owero stolidit?'), c. 1603, woodcut, from C. Ripa, Iconolog?a. goat (caprone) which Delia Porta says is typified by great cru elty of character, and a she- goat (capra) whose conduct, like that of a donkey, shows foolhardiness, a trait equally charac teristic of certain human types.24 Delia Porta did not provide any illustration of the alleged similarity but the gap is filled by Cesare Ripa's allegory of foolishness, showing a female per sonification leading a she-goat which (citing Aristotle) is defined as the embodiment of obstinate foolhardiness and folly (stupidit?' owero stolidit?) [Fig. 3].25 Since goats were traditionally associated with religious cults, the folly of the goat could also be related to religion. In the context of the Roman Church's struggle with its opponents obstinate folly could be understood as a rejection of the Catholic doctrine. The sculptural group may thus have a submerged thematic 164 meaning conveyed by its details. The symbolic connotations of the scallop shell from which one of the infants drinks seems to refer to the drinking of wine in the liturgy of the Eucharist.26 The allusion to the sacred ritual which is accom panied by the ringing of a bell, may also account for the little bell dangling from the goat's neck. The ivy wreath worn by the other child associates him with pagan rites. The she-goat nursing the two infants each representing a different persua sion, may thus be understood as the common mother of paganism and Christianity, the former perhaps also repre senting those who reject the Catholic doctrine. The two infants would thus represent the theological split of Christian ity while the goat's suffering could be understood as a com ment on humanity's need for spiritual redemption. The little bell would be a humorous reminder of how salvation can be achieved. The sixteen-year-old Bernini would of course hard ly have dared to make fun of the moral task of the Roman Church, but the witty note may have been suggested to him by one of his ecclesiastic mentors who in private life were often less strict in their observance of the official ideology. The Foreboding Gorgon The study of dramatic physiognomic expressions, attest ed by the version of the Laocoon, soon bore fruit in a marble bust representing the Gorgon Medusa [Fig. 4].27 The attribu tion of this work to Bernini first proposed in the eighteenth century, has remained uncontested, but in view of certain technical weaknesses the date, initially assigned to about 1630, has been pushed back to the juvenile phase of Bernini's career, perhaps between 1616 and 1618. The bust set on a low base shows only a part of the shoulders with a fragment of drapery. A wreath of serpents writhing around the head leaves no doubt that the personage represents the malign Gorgon whose gaze petrified men, literally turning them into stone.28 The tense facial expression, especially the wrinkled forehead with converging eyebrows may perhaps refer to the deadly intensity of the Gorgon's gaze but the general effect of the fea tures can hardly be described as monstrous. Rather the oppo site: her round face, straight nose and full cheeks and espe cially the cupid-bow mouth might justify calling her pretty. She has in fact been compared to Bernini's portrait of his mistress Constanza Bonarelli, suggesting that the latter served as model for the mythological character.29 However since the Bonarelli bust is dated 1637-1638, the young woman can hardly have been the one who two decades earlier posed for the Medusa. The comparison only emphasizes the intensity of the Gorgon's frown.</page><page sequence="5">ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 4) G.-L. Bernini, ?Medusa?, 1619 (?), marble bust. Rome, Musei Capitolini, Palazzo dei Conservatori. The purpose of the Medusa bust and the circumstances of its commission are also not clear. According to one sugges tion the subject evokes a heraldic family emblem of one of Bernini's mentors. This however, does not sit well with the pathetic expression of the features. As an alternative the mar ble effigy could be related to the story of Perseus's gift of Medusa's head to Athena, who affixed it to her aegis.30 The decapitated head of the Gorgon became a popular apothropaeic decoration of warriors' shields and temple fa?ades, where with reference to the monster's deadly gaze, the head was always shown frontally.31 The symmetrical effect 5) B. Cellini, ?Medusa? (preliminary work), 1545, bronze cast. London, Victoria and Albert Museum. of the monster's face persisted even on antique coinage, where heads are usually shown in profile,32 but in the Greco Roman tradition the hideous Gorgon was transformed into a carefully coifed maiden.33 The type was later evoked in the incongruously serene features of the severed head of the Medusa brandished by Cellini's Perseus.34 However, Bernini may have known that the classical beauty and perfection of Cellini's Medusa head was preceded by a sketch - model of the head which displays a ghostly and ghastly expression of pain [Fig. 5].35 The expression of inner turbulence conveyed by the wrin kled brow which Cellini's preliminary work shares with Berni ni's Medusa and especially the dishevelled hair associate the marble bust with the narrative tradition. In the Metamorpho ses, at that time already available in Lodovico Dolce's Italian translation, Ovid says that the terrifying Gorgon was once 165</page><page sequence="6">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 6) ?Medusa, relief on the Tazza Farnese? from Alexandria, 1st c. A.D., bronze. Naples, Archaeological Museum. a lovely maiden, admired by many suitors, and of all her beau ties her hair was the greatest. One day her charms attracted Neptune who raped her in Minerva's sanctuary. The goddess avenged the desecration of her temple by turning the Gor gon's hair into a nest of wriggling serpents.36 The strange tale was later taken up by Christian authors who interpreted the chastisement of the Gorgon as an edifying moral paradigm. In the Ow'de Moralis?e the Gorgon personifies the carnal delights for which, conveniently forgetting Neptune's part in the affair, she was punished by having her hair changed into a nest of vipers.37 The association of the Gorgon with lust per sisted in humanistic literature. In the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili the lovers visit a sanctuary of Venus adorned with an effigy of the decapitated Medusa described as "awesome, furi ous, accursed and horrible" (spavetevola furiale maledicta et horribile).38 The text illustration does not show the terrifying mask,39 but the very explicit description of its effect may be associated with a bas-relief image of the Gorgon's head on the reverse of a large first century AD Alexandrine cameo known 166 as the Tazza Farnese [Fig. 6].40 The antique gem was once owned by Lorenzo de'Medici, who according to some schol ars had a part in the early draft of the Hypnerotomachia - it has even been suggested that the protagonist of the romance rep resents Lorenzo and the story evokes his passion for Lucrezia Ardingheli.41 Though this is only a hypothesis, the Hypnero tomachi?s characterization of the Gorgon has a remarkable affinity with the gem once owned by Lorenzo. The object which inspired the verbal description eventually came into the Farnese collection in Rome. It was certainly known to the young Caravaggio who used it as a model for a painted shield featuring the decapitated Medusa.42 The shield which original ly hung in Cardinal Francesco del Monte's household in Rome was eventually sent to Florence as a wedding gift to his friend, the Grand Duke Ferdinando de'Medici, but the memory of the horrific image lingered in Rome, and what is more relevant here, the antique prototype was presumably available to Bernini. Combining the impression made by the Tazza Farnese relief with the verbal description in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili Bernini created an allegorical bust whose significance can be better understood in the light of Ripa's manual of iconology. The text mentions the Gorgon in instructions for the depiction of an allegory of Reason (Ragione) which is to be shown as a young woman embracing a laurel tree from which is suspended a shield with the head of Medusa in the centre. The laurel tree symbolizes the victory of Reason, while the decapitated reason-less Medusa alludes to "the discomfiture of the enemies of virtue".43 The somewhat roundabout expla nation of the Gorgon's meaning may be applied to Bernini's Medusa as well. As a symbol of the loss of reason, presum ably resulting from the unrestrained pursuit of carnal delights, the marble bust would evoke the need to subjugate the libido by the intellect. The bust could thus be seen as a sculptural counterpart of Caravaggio's shield-like painting of the same subject that was owned by the Cardinal del Monte,44 however, unlike Caravaggio who depicted the beheaded Gorgon, Berni ni showed her still alive, which implies that the cruel punish ment has not yet taken place. The vivid grimace of the Medusa in fact suggests that she still possesses her fatal power. To a viewer aware of the moralistic exegesis of story, the bust would convey a submerged meaning. The intensity of Medusa's gaze could be understood as a half-serious warning to those who succumb to the sensual charms of the Antique. The moralistic message would perhaps be appreciated by members of the Curia who sought to harmonize the prudery prescribed by the Counter Reformation with their enthusiasm for the classical legacy. We do not know who commissioned the bust nor for whom its message was meant, but the work's</page><page sequence="7">ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI wE^B m z ^*_^^^^^^H ^B^ V Vfc * *_i __j__^B _Hdf^ .^ r ^%^rvl^_^_^_^_i _ _&amp;: , n__P T ' ^H _^_^_^___|?

Both busts in the Spanish Embassy to the Vatican. success in the Roman milieu had far reaching consequences in Bernini's subsequent use of vivid mimicry as means of artis tic communication. Antithetical Facial Expressions. The reciprocal reinforcement of contrasting expressions, already evident in the opposition between the tormented she -goat and the smiling infants next to her [Fig. 1] became more explicit in two life-size busts, one representing the Anima Beata (blessed soul, which Bernini's biographer Baldinucci describes as the "saved one"), the other an Anima Dannata (condemned soul) [Figs. 7a and b].45 Similarly to the marble Medusa the paired busts have a moralistic meaning. The Anima Beata has the appearance of a young girl piously con templating a heavenly vision, her counterpart is a male whose horrid grimace suggests that he is looking down at the subter 167</page><page sequence="8">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q ranean regions of hell to which he is destined. The fact that the grimace of the Damned has an affinity with the expression of Bernini's Medusa implies that the three busts may belong to the same phase of artist's career. However, since the features of the Blessed and of the Damned do not show the technical uncertainty of the Medusa, the paired effigies may have been carved a little later. Besides their obvious intention as exercises in contrasting physiognomic expressions, the two busts convey a conceptu al message. Considering that they were commissioned by a Spanish church dignitary, Monsignor Pedro de Montoya, and were placed in a church of the Spanish community in Rome, the contrasting facial expressions may be related to the concept of the wages of Virtue and Sin as represented by the fates of the righteous and the sinners at the Last Judgment. However, contrary to the persistent iconographie tradition which showed the complete bodies of the resurrected here they are represented as busts, an artistic formula that is usual ly associated with commemorative purposes rather than nar rative representations. The reference to the sculptures as 'Souls', may be explained by the impact of Ripa's instructions for the depiction of the souls of the blessed and the accursed respectively. The soul of the blessed, described as "reason able" is to be portrayed as "a gracious maiden whom God has created in his own likeness". The text says nothing about her expression, but suggests that her purity is to be made visible by the immaculate perfection and bright luminosity of her fea tures. She is to be juxtaposed with the accursed one, a melan choly figure which, Ripa says, "is commonly represented in real and imaginary tragedies". He is to be shown "suffering, wounded and tormented, his disarrayed hair signifying not only a profound unhappiness and misery but also the privation of intellect".46 Bernini followed these instructions to the letter. The upturned features of the feminine Anima Beata attract light while the distorted features of the male Anima Dannata sug gest insanity. In the historical context of the Catholic Church's struggle with Reformation the physiognomic contrast seems to remind the viewer of the future beatitude of those who adhere to the true doctrine and the dismal fate of those who oppose it. An additional note of interest is suggested by the fact that the expression of the Damned recalls the similar grimace of Caravaggio's Medusa. This led to a suggestion that Bernini's work may also represent the artist's study of his own features in the mirror.47 The pathetic effigy of the Damned may in fact be related to a Renaissance tradition of artists alluding to their creative torment by representing themselves as martyrs, the message was usually communicated by painful mimicry.48 By lending his features to the Damned the ambitious Bernini may have wished to associate himself with the great Renaissance masters. The pathetic bust became a precedent of Bernini's exploit of the dramatic potential of his own features but in the later self-portraits he never again presented himself as a victim of his vocation. Physiognomic Aspects of the Self-Portraits In the course of his long life Bernini depicted himself on many occasions, producing works whose biographic interest parallels that of the portraits of Caravaggio and Rembrandt. Besides being a testimony to their author's introspective ten dency, Bernini's self-portraits suggest he shared the contem porary belief that in providing an indication of a person's char acter the face also shows his intellectual aptitudes. The latter concept is taken up by Baldinucci, who declares that "Bernini was one of the individuals predestined to marvellous achieve ment whose spirit from the dawn of their lives flashes forth from their eyes in such abundance, that it seems that it actual ly appears at the window of their countenance, revealing a hint of the most secret beauties". Writing about Bernini's appear ance, Baldinucci says that it "indicated the salient traits of his personality and creative ardour. He was of average stature with a somewhat dark complexion and black hair that turned white with age, his eyes spirited and lively with piercing gaze under heavy eyebrows. When giving orders he terrified with his gaze alone".49 The impact of Bernini's gaze is also men tioned by the Sieur Fr?art de Chantelou who accompanied the sixty-five-year-old master on his visit to the French court. Referring to the contemporary theory of comparative physiog nomy he noted that "Bernini's face is eagle-like, especially the eyes. His eyebrows are long, his brow large with slight projec tion over the eyes. He is bald and the hair that remains is curly and white".50 Modern writers discussing Bernini's personality also refer to his appearance, paying particular attention to the allegorical role-portraits where the artist chose to present him self as a historical or literary character. In some of these por traits one may also discern his self-association with certain animals. One of the most illuminating examples of Bernini's role portraits is the over life size statue of David in the Borghese Gallery showing the hero as a young man who defeated the Philistine.51 What is interesting about this work is the fact that Bernini's mentors not only approved of his self-presentation as the biblical character but actually encouraged him in this. Both Baldinucci and Bernini's son Domenico report that while he was carving the marble David in his likeness, Cardinal Maf feo Barberini, who in the same year (1623) became Pope 168</page><page sequence="9">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI Urban VIII, often came to the studio and with his own hand held the mirror for Bernini.52 The credibility of this anecdote is supported by comparing the features of the marble David with Bernini's oil painting of himself, of approximately the same date.53 The more lively facial expression of the statue is espe cially striking when compared with the somewhat flaccid fea tures of the Roman Gladiator, also in the Borghese Gallery, often cited as the antique prototype of marble David.54 More relevant is the fact that role-portrait suggests that in associat ing himself with the biblical hero Bernini wished to be seen as a victorious fighter. The harp, a symbol of art which he placed at David's feet suggests that he also claimed the hero as his artistic predecessor. The psychological implications of the David role-portrait have several precedents in the work of Renaissance artists; some identified themselves with the biblical winner55 but oth ers represented themselves as his victim. Such unsettling self -portraits were interpreted as tokens of the artist's personal suffering alluding to the contemporary belief that artistic suc cess is achieved only at the price of many tribulations.56 None of this is valid for Bernini. Recognized as a prodigy when he was only eight years old, he was consistently encouraged by his father. His precocity earned him the admiration and favour of powerful patrons who hailed him as "the Michelangelo of his century". He was soon entrusted with prestigious commis sions which provoked the jealousy of other artists, but he invariably triumphed over them and his entire career was a succession of splendid achievements. Thus, even if he was aware of the concept of creative torment, he had no reason to consider himself a sufferer. Rather the contrary. Since his youth he not only felt himself destined to succeed but would also have believed that his features showed a premonition of his future glory. The idea is clearly reflected in his self-portrait as the victorious David. Few critics noted that the young bibli cal hero is represented as an athletic adult but writers aware of the contemporary theory of physiognomy suggested that David's head conveys a specific conceptual meaning [Fig. 8]. One scholar remarked that the receding forehead, the protrud ing eyebrows, and the curved nose all follow the zoomorphic typology of the "leonine face" appropriate to the choleric per sonality of a man of war who was hailed as the 'Lion of Judah'.57 The interpretation is somewhat problematic. The lion to which the marble David is compared, was in fact an emblem of the tribe of Judah (Gen. 49:9) and the biblical hero in fact came from Bethlehem in Judea (I Sam 17:12). The young David may have been enraged by his Philistine opponent how ever there is no ground to describe him as choleric. After he became king he fought many battles but to call the adolescent David a warrior is incorrect. The whole point of the story of his 8) G.-L. Bernini, ?David's Head? (detail of a full-length figure), 1623, marble. Rome, Galleria Borghese. combat with Goliath is that David was a simple shepherd, not a man of war. Moreover, since David later defeated a lion (I Sam. 17:32-37) the alleged "leonine traits" ascribed to the marble statue are also questionable. According to Delia Porta an individual resembling a lion is liberal, magnanimous, easy to anger, and also has a powerful urge to win - all of which might be appropriate for the hero, but the head of the marble statue suggests hardly any resemblance to a lion, and even less so to Delia Porta's illustration a "leonine type" [Fig. 13]. David's receding brow, the low frowning eyebrows and the beaked nose would rather justify a comparison to bird of prey. The avian typology would also fit Bernini, who in his old age 169</page><page sequence="10">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 9) ?Emperor Servio Galba compared to an Eagle?, 17th c, engraving, from G. Delia Porta, Fisionom?a naturale. impressed the contemporaries by the sharpness of his "eagle -like traits and the intensity of his gaze". At the time he carved the marble David the aquiline features would have been more prominent. If he consulted Delia Porta's treatise he would have read that a person resembling an eagle may be easily angered and even behave with fury, but is ultimately destined for glory. The typological characterization is illustrated by the compari son of a profile of a Roman emperor with the head of an eagle which also resembles the profile of Dawd [Fig. 9].58 The resemblance is no doubt deliberate. Bernini himself elsewhere associated the flight of an eagle with ascent of the intellect to the upper spheres [Fig. 10].59 This would be appropriate for David who was chosen to rule Israel, but with reference to Bernini the aquiline traits could be understood as alluding to his confidence in his artistic superiority. Bernini's self-identification with the biblical hero was not a passing whim. The marble David has a somewhat less well known counterpart in an oil painting done shortly after Bernini finished the statue, representing David with Goliath's Head [Fig. 11].60 The fact that in the picture David is shown consid erably younger may mean that in response to the possible objection to the sculpture as representing a too mature David, in the painting Bernini adhered more closely to the text which explicitly stresses David's youth (I Sam. 17:14). The youthful ness also conformed to Bernini's earlier role-portrait as David 170 10) F. Poilly (after Bernini), ?An Eagle between Heaven and Earth? (detail), 1652, engraving, from N. Zucchi, ?ptica philosophica. on a black chalk drawing which shows the artist as he was in his teens [Fig. 12].61 The juvenile study which features a strong contrast between the pleasant faced youth and the macabre head of Goliath, seems to have been inspired by Car avaggio's painting of the same subject in the Borghese collec tion.62 However, the ambitious teenager rejected Caravaggio's self-presentation as the beheaded giant, preferring to cast himself as the winner. The psychologically significant youthful self-identification was later repeated in the oil paining believed to have been done in response to Pope Urban's suggestion that the young sculptor ought expand his art to other media63 Bernini again presented himself as the hero but he altered the expressive effect of the juvenile drawing by moving Goliath's head to the right side [Fig. 11]. This modifies the semantic effect of the representation. Assuming that a person accustomed to read ing the Latin script follows this habit when looking at pictures, the drawing showing Goliath's head on the (viewer's) left would be understood as "the head of Goliath held by David". In the painting the semantic prominence of Goliath is reduced. One starts from young hero whose uplifted brightly illuminated face alludes to divine inspiration while the colossal head of Goliath relegated to the shadow.64 The pictorial contrast between the handsome David and the unattractive features of the beheaded Philistine may be seen as an illustration of the dialectical polarity of physiognomic beauty and ugliness. The effect brings to mind Leonardo's sketches of attractive youths paired with grotesque old men. Leonardo's observation on the</page><page sequence="11">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 11) G.-L. Bernini, ?Self-portrait as David with Goliath's Head?, c. 1625. Rome, Galleria Nazionale dell'Arte Antica. reciprocal reinforcement of contrasting facial expressions was later developed into the aesthetic concept that the contiguity of beauty and ugliness being was as necessary as the moral contrast of virtue and vice. Artists who pursued the ideal of sublime beauty were expected to depict the idea of ugliness as well. Bernini's response to this criterion may be seen in the Anima Beata and theAn/Tna Dannata. The art critic Monsignor Giovanni Massani who served Pope Urban as a maestro di casa, contended that an artist may not only imitate ugliness but actually create it by deliberately distorting beauty.65 In the typology of Goliath Bernini seems to have referred again to Delia Porta's treatise, where a man characterized by abundant 12) G.-L. Bernini, ?Self-Portrait as David with Goliath's Head?, c. 1615, black chalk drawing. Windsor Castle, Royal Collection. hair, a rounded and split tip of the nose (naso rotondo e nel cima rintruzzato) and a square forehead, is compared to a lion. The resemblance is said to indicate the individual's strength, courage and magnanimity [Fig. 13].66 The corre spondence of this description to the vanquished Goliath's head strikes one as an incongruity. However, if we assume that rather than a narrative illustration of the biblical story, the role portrait is an 'iconic image' in which the severed head which David holds against his chest, has the function of an emblem recalling the monster heads which one may see on warriors' breastplates, the leonine characterization of Goliath becomes an attribute of David. Moreover, the leonine traits of the Philis 171</page><page sequence="12">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q _ _ 13) ?Man Compared to a Lion?, 17th c, engraving, from G. Delia Porta, Fisonom?a naturale. tine's head recall the face of a vaguely anthropomorphic lion in Ripa's allegory of self-discipline (dominio di se stesso) where the lion represents the instincts which the hero must subordinate [Fig. 14].67 Bernini's painting seems to convey a similar meaning. By showing David with the leonine head of Goliath on his breast the young artist was assuming the moral virtue for himself. Expressive Physiognomic Aberrations Pope Urban VIM's appreciation of Bernini's role-portraits brought a commission for a frontispiece of a volume of the Pope's Poemata.68 The preliminary drawing shows the young David strangling a lion [Fig. 15]. The choice of biblical theme may refer to an exegetic tradition according to which David's subjugation of the lion is a pr?figuration of Christ's defeat of the devil. The frontispiece illustration would thus allude to the moral task of the Pontiff, but the meaning of the represented combat seems to go beyond its typological aspect. The preparatory drawing suggests that Bernini may have seen a classicist statue of Roman gladiator killing a lion, known from the monumental catalogue of the Giustiniani collection in Rome.69 The possible evocation of this sculpture could allude to the humanistic culture of the author of the Poemata, but 172 14) ?Dominion of the Self? (Dominio di se' stesso), c.1603, woodcut, from C. Ripa, Iconolog?a. drawing is also related to Ripa's allegory of "dominion over the self", where the human features of the lion identify it as the hero's "alter ego" over which he exercises moral control [Fig. 14]. Bernini enhanced the dramatic effect of the combat by the twisted pose of the young David and by the sharp foreshorten ing of the lion's body but he rejected the menacing expression of the lions face. This suggests that the frontispiece was not meant to be understood as alluding to the restraint of an objectionable behaviour. The modification of the allegorical message is implied also by the fact that Bernini drew in the foreground a large harp similar to that which he placed at the feet of the marble David. Here however, the attribute presum ably refers to the Pope alluding to the fact that in his verses Urban VIII often paraphrased the Psalms, and also that in his entourage he was praised as an alter David. The harp being</page><page sequence="13">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 15) G.-L. Bernini, ?David Strangling a Lion?, sanguine drawing. Paris, Louvre, Departement des Arts Graphiques. laid aside suggests the Popes "dominion of the self" in aban doning his poetic vocation in order to dedicate himself to the Church. The Poemata were later reprinted in several editions each of which was given a different frontispiece.70 In one of these the association of Urban VIM's with the biblical poet was evoked again, the engraving shows David playing the harp while a river god reclining nearby offers him a laurel crown [Fig. 16].71 Since river-gods often represent the Earth, the engraving may be understood as conveying the idea that like David's Psalms Urban's poetry is praised by the whole world. Whatever one 16) M. Gallus (after Bernini), ?David Crowned by the Rivergod Jordan?, 1638, engraving (frontispiece of Urban VIMs Poemata). Vatican, Biblioteca Apost?lica, Stampe Barberiane. may think of the identification of the Pope with the Psalmist, the engraving offers additional interest in the representation of the river-god whose body is sharply foreshortened. We have noted Bernini's interest in such virtual deformations in the first design for the Poemata frontispiece. A similar effect may also be seen in the artist's two self-portraits as David where the low viewing station results in a sharp foreshortening of Goliaths head [Figs. 11-12]. Since in rhetorical comparisons of artistic media painters referred to the representations of perspective effects as an argument for the superiority of their art, Bernini may have wished to show himself proficient in this pictorial undertaking. 173</page><page sequence="14">AVIGDOR W.

Scholars believe that Bernini was taught painting by Francesco Sacchi whose views on depicting optical foreshort ening are very evident in Bernini's Apostles Andrewand Thomas [Fig. 17].72 Andrew, a Galilean fisherman (John 1:40-41), is identified by a fish lying before him. The upward motion of his head resulting in a virtual aberration of the features and the 174 expressive gesture of the hand suggest that Andrew is trying to reason with the "doubting Thomas" (John 20:19-29), who, according to some writers may represent another role-portrait of the young Bernini.73 The artist who used the mirror to study the dynamic effect of his grimaces may have used it again in depicting the foreshortening of the apostle's face and hands.</page><page sequence="15">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 18) G.-L. Bernini, ?Head of St. Teresa? (detail of Ecstasy of St. Teresa), c. 1650, marble. Rome, Santa Maria della Vittoria, Cornaro Chapel. Eventually Bernini acquired the ability to draw anatomical foreshortening without looking at a live model enabling him to sketch the visual effect of a statue set in an elevated position even before it was made. He employed the method in the preparatory studies for the group of St. Teresa in Ecstasy where the saint's upturned face is seen from below [Fig. 18].74 One of the sketches anticipates the optical deformation of the saint's head by showing the prominence of the throat and of the chin which seems blown out of its natural size; the shortened nose assumes a triangular shape, the nostrils are broadened and the forehead seems forcibly pushed into the virtual depth [Fig. 19]. The resulting distortion of the features is so pronounced that the sketch might easily be taken for a physiognomic carica ture.75 The expressive effect becomes even more thought-pro voking when one considers that Bernini was one of the pio neers of that genre. His graphic wit may be exemplified in an often reproduced caricature of one of his patrons, the Cardinal Scipione Borghese [Fig. 20].76 The contemporaries certainly appreciated Bernini's capacity to reduce the features of a famil iar personality to a few graphic strokes, but even a modern viewer who has no acquaintance with this church dignitary is m * '$ -, i?4 &lt;&lt;y -? 19) G.-L. Bernini, ?Study for the Head of Saint Teresa?, c. 1650, sanguine drawing. Leipzig, Museum der bildenden K?nste. amused by the suggestion that the inner energy seems to burst the Cardinal's features out of their place. The comic appeal of such witty drawings has been variously interpreted. The French philosopher Henri Bergson suggested that the facial deforma tions are spontaneously re-enacted in the viewer's imagination, resulting in a comic activation of the image.77 This may seem less far-fetched when one considers that in real life as well an expressive grimace is perceived as resulting from a dynamic movement of the features which the beholder instinctively re enacts in his mind. A young child may actually imitate the facial 175</page><page sequence="16">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 20) G.-L. Bernini, ?Caricature of Cardinal Scipione Borghese?, 1632, pen and ink, Rome, Biblioteca Vaticana. expressions of another person. Even more interesting is the fact that the imaginary activation of a distorted image is not lim ited to physiognomic caricatures. The effect occurs also when looking at a perspective representation of a three-dimensional object, for instance a drawing of a cube showing the square shape of the facets virtually distorted. The fact that in spite of the optical deformation the beholder perceives such an image as a cube suggests that the irregular shapes are mentally rotat ed until they assume the familiar appearance of a cube.78 The process of mental rotation may also occur when we are looking at anatomical foreshortenings, for instance the reclining river god on the frontispiece of Pope Urban's Poemata, or the sketch of the foreshortened features of St. Teresa. The projec tion of the viewer's mental activity upon such representations seems to inject them with a strong suggestion of inner energy. It seems to me that a somewhat similar effect occurs when one is presented with a face that shows a sharp departure from nor mative human features, for instance a portrait of a person who bears a strong resemblance to a beast. I am referring not only to caricatures where the subject is deliberately given zoomor phic traits but also to bona fide portraits of individuals having a certain physiognomic similarity to animals. The viewer's men 176 tal discernment of animal features in the human face makes such portraits especially expressive. The illustrations of Delia Porta's treatise on comparative physiognomy offer many exam ples of this kind; we have seen for instance a human profile compared to an eagle and man with leonine features [Figs. 9 and 13]. However, it is seldom noted that the illustrations juxta posing men and animals suggest that the animals represented not only resemble the human heads but also seem to experi ence human emotions. The effect occurs again in works of art. The young Bernini for instance, effectively conveyed the suffer ing of the she-goat Amalthea. His ability to give an animal a human expression assumed a greater conceptual signifi cance in his sculpture of an elephant. Human Intelligence of an Elephant The small elephant carrying an authentic five-metre-high Egyptian obelisk on its back, which Bernini erected in 1667 in the Piazza della Minerva in Rome is one of his most original works [Fig. 21 ].79 The bizarre composition has been explained as a personal emblem (impresa) of the ambitious Pope Alexander VII, suggesting that the strange association of the obelisk with the exotic animal symbolizes the scholarly Pon tiff's yearning for the gift of divine wisdom.80 The interpretation has been repeated quite frequently but less attention has been paid to the fact that the elephant may be understood as an ide alized portrait of the Pope. We shall see presently that Bernini not only identified his august patron with the elephant but actually gave it his typological features.81 Bernini's composite monument has been compared to an elephant carrying an obelisk on the Fontana dell'Elefante in the main town square of Catania in Sicily. That elephant, said to be Phoenician, was adopted as the emblem of Catania and the obelisk on its back once stood in the Roman circus of that city. However the assumed antiquity of the Sicilian monument was disproved when it was revealed to have been the work of an eighteenth-century architect, one Giovanni Battista Vaccari ni who actually imitated Bernini's composition in the Piazza della Minerva.82 Since other suggestions tracing the source of Bernini's work to antique coinage have proved equally uncon vincing, the sculpture is now generally seen as an original invenzione. The innovatory aspect also results in the assign ment of a seemingly human expression to the elephant. Bernini's project was originally motivated by the need of a suitable setting for a then recently discovered ancient Egypt ian obelisk which Francesco Barberini, the nephew of Pope Urban VIII, wished to place in the Palazzo Barberini gardens. Bernini submitted several alternative designs, one of which he</page><page sequence="17">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 21) G.-L. Bernini, ?Elephant and Obelisk?, 1666-1667, marble and granite. Rome, Piazza Santa Maria della Minerva. developed into a bozzetto featuring an elephant.83 The motif may have been inspired by the an impression made by a real elephant shown in Rome in 1630. The curious linkage of the obelisk with an elephant may be explained in the fact that the both originate in Africa and also that the personification of that 22) ?The Elephant's Head? (detail of Fig. 21). continent in Ripa's Iconology wears an elephant's trunk in her hair as an attribute [Fig. 23]. After Pope Urban's death in 1644, the project of the composite sculpture was abandoned but Bernini utilized the invenzione as the basis of a theatrical prop of an elephant carrying a castle, commissioned in 1651 by the Spanish ambassador in Rome, in honour of the birth of the Spanish Infanta.84 However, the idea for the monument lin gered and work on it was resumed under the auspices of Pope Alexander VII, who decided to situate the elephant with the obelisk in front of the ancient church of Santa Maria della Min erva. The execution of the work was entrusted to Bernini's assistant Ercole Ferrata who placed the sculpture on a pedestal bearing two dedicatory tablets. One of these says: "In the year of Salvation 1667, Alexander VII dedicated to Divine Wisdom the obelisk sacred to the Egyptian Pallas, which has been wrested from the earth so that it might be erected in Minerva's piazza which belongs to the Mother of God".85 The latter part of this inscription alludes to the fact that the church of Santa Maria della Minerva stands on the site of an ancient temple of Isis, re-dedicated to Minerva, patroness of wisdom and Roman counterpart of the Greek Pallas, who in the Middle Ages was Christianized as a "type" of the Virgin Mary.86 The fact that the word "minerva" was also the current synonym for wisdom87 suggests that a humanist would recog 177</page><page sequence="18">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 23) ?Personification of Africa?, c.1603, woodcut, from C. Ripa, Iconolog?a. nize in the seemingly anachronistic reference to the 'Egyptian Pallas' a rhetorical reference to the wisdom of Egypt. This sug gestion is elaborated in the second inscription, which says: "Let any beholder of the carved images of the wisdom of Egypt on the obelisk carried by the elephant realize that it takes a robust mind to carry solid wisdom.88 The robust mind presumably belongs to the elephant. The suggestion of the elephant's sagacity is more clearly explicated in a panegyric presumably composed on the occasion of the inauguration of the monument. It says: "The obelisk, symbol of the rays of Sol, is brought by the elephant to the Seventh Alexander as a gift; is not the animal wise? The wisdom has been given only to thee, o Seventh Alexander, consequently thou has the gift of Sol". The author of this verse was evidently aware that Egypt ian obelisks were connected with solar worship, but the refer 178 ence to the gift of Sol seems to refer to the Roman emperors' honorific title Sol invictus (Invincible Sun) which would be appropriate for a Pope who considered himself the heir to the Roman empire. It is also possible that the Sol may allude to Sol hominem (Mankind's Sun) a rhetorical epithet for Solomon as the paradigm of supreme wisdom, which, the versifier says, the elephant shares with Alexander VII.89 The intellectual capacity ascribed to the elephant strikes one as unexpected. A modern viewer might consider the ani mal as embodiment of bulk or great weight; elephantine means unwieldy; 'an elephant in a china shop' denotes clum siness. However, since in antiquity tame elephants were used in warfare, in medieval traditions an elephant came to repre sent a "Christian soldier" who fights evil. This concept would perhaps make the animal an appropriate symbol of the moral task of the Papacy. The conceptual linkage of the elephant with the wisdom of Egypt reflects humanist fascination with the hieroglyphic script which at that time could be studied on the dozen or so obelisks brought to Rome in antiquity and still to be seen on the piazzas.90 These enigmatic pictographs were the object of various decoding attempts; the eminent philologist Athanasius Kircher interpreted the inscription on the Piazza della Minerva obelisk as a solemn dedication to "the highest Genius whom the Egyptians called World Spir it".91 In accordance with the syncretic method of exegesis the World Spirit would probably be associated with the Holy Spir it. The elephant would thus be understood as possessing the grace of divine inspiration. The conceptual significance ascribed to Bernini's monu ment may also be related to the many references to the Egypt ian obelisks in the illustrations of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. Art historians have long noted the similarity of Berni ni's composite sculpture to a woodcut showing a fantastic monument consisting of an obelisk balancing on a small ele phant [Fig. 24].92 The particular relevance of this illustration is supported by the fact that a copy of the Hypnerotomachia was annotated by Pope Alexander VII who wrote a marginal com ment about the mystery of the Resurrection next to the text about the elephant. The apparently incongruous association of the elephant with the religious theme suggests the Pope's familiarity with Ripa's Iconology where a personification of reli gion is accompanied by an elephant described as a ieroglifo di religione (hieroglyph of religion) [Fig. 25].93 The illustration, and implicitly the symbolic significance of the elephant, would, of course, be known to Bernini, who, as we have seen, was also familiar with the Hypnorotomachia. However, comparison of the Hypnerotomachia woodcut with Bernini's elephant allows one to observe some remarkable differences between the two animals. One is the shape of the elephant's ear. In the</page><page sequence="19">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 24) ?Elephant and Obelisk?, c. 1499, woodcut, from F. Colonna, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. woodcut the contour of the ear is plain and rounded while the grooved form of the sculptured elephant's ear reminds one of a scallop shell [Fig. 22]. Considering that a conch is a conven tional symbol of sanctity94 the shell-shaped ear of the elephant 25) ?Allegory of Religion?, c. 1603, woodcut, from C. Ripa, Iconolog?a. suggests that this was the means the elephant acquired its sacred wisdom. Its intelligence is even more evident in the expression of its large wide open eyes diverging from the half closed eye in the Hypnerromachia woodcut, but suggesting a possible reference to Ripa's allegory of religion [Fig. 25].95 Bernini went even further than Ripa. The upturned pupils, a conventional indication of heavenly inspiration often seen in portraits of saints, and the prominence of the elephant's domed forehead give it an almost human expression [Fig. 22]. The physiognomic effect has been noted by some writers who thought it a visual pun. As such it might be related to Bernini's witty portrait sketches. However, the elephant sculpture hardly qualifies as a caricature and a comic intention is not compati ble with a public monument celebrating the sagacity of the reigning Pontiff. 179</page><page sequence="20">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ IO.BAPTIST? PORT^ Ojfofa cer m faci?s o?cntatm: 26) ?Socrates compared to a Stag?, early 17th c, woodcut, from G. Delia Porta, Fisionom?a naturale. It seems to me that the elephant's human expression may again refer to Bernini's knowledge of Delia Porta's compara tive physiognomy. The text actually refers to the elephant as a judicious beast distinguished by extraordinary intelligence, but strangely enough there is no illustration either of an ele phant or of the related human type that resembles it and has similar intellectual traits. The human type which Della Porta chooses as a representative of outstanding human wisdom is Socrates, whose portrait, the author says, was drawn after an antique bust owned by his brother Vincenzo. The typological features of the philosopher are compared to those of a stag, whose intelligence is said to be manifest in the bone structure of its skull: the prominent forehead and perfectly formed eyes are described as the visible signs of wisdom [Fig. 26]. Berni ni's appreciation of the meaning of a "Socratic type" is attest ed in several of his works. One is the painting showing "doubt ing Thomas" being addressed by St. Andrew who has the characteristic features of a sage [Fig. 17]. Bernini also assigned the Socratic traits of a bald crane and high forehead to the statue of St. Athanasius, the learned Father of the Church in the apse of St. Peter's beside the Cathedra Petri. The same physiognomic traits occur also in a statue of Saint Jerome in the Chigi Chapel (belonging to the family of Alexan der VII) in Siena, and in a sketch of the penitent Saint Jerome [Fig. 27].96 Even more remarkable is the fact that the "Socratic 180 27) G.-L. Bernini, ?St. Jerome in Penitence?, c.1665 (?), pen and wash. Paris, Louvre. features" also characterize some of Bernini's several portraits of Pope Alexander VII. In most of these the Pope is shown wearing the triple crown of his office or a least the Papal cap which covers his bald head, but when the Pope is bareheaded the typological traits are more apparent. The effect is especial ly evident in Bernini's preliminary design for the Pope's sepul chre, where the head, no doubt sketched from memory, shows "Socratic features" [Fig. 28].97 One must not be surprised by the resemblance; if the theory of physiognomic typology is taken seriously it is only natural that a wise Pope should share the characteristic traits of great sages, both pagan and Christ</page><page sequence="21">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 28) G.-L. Bernini, ?Pope Alexander VII? (a design for the Pope's sepulchre), c. 1655, pen and wash. Windsor Castle, Royal Collection. ian. More to the point is the fact that the elephant on the mon ument to Alexander VII displays the same typological features: it has the bald crane and huge forehead of Socrates as well as his large eyes, while the philosopher's ungainly nose is evoked in the beast's trunk. The point is that the physiognom ic traits which associate the elephant with Socrates of course also liken it to Alexander VII. Alexander VN's apparent approval of being represented as an elephant may be connected to his knowledge that he was not the first Pope to be represented as an animal. His Borgia predecessor, Alexander VI, had himself depicted in the Vatican Borgia Apartments in the guise of the Egyptian bull Apis. By agreeing to be represented as an elephant Alexander VII would have been subscribing to the then fashionable theo ry of comparative physiognomy, but the anthropomorphic fea tures which Bernini gave his elephant may be seen as an orig inal inversion of Delia Porta's methodology. Instead of the animal being a key to the character of a person Bernini trans ferred the paradigmatic traits of a human type to an animal. Though the sculpture was not meant to be comic the discov 29) G.-L. Bernini, ?Vision of the Emperor Constantine?, 1670, marble. Vatican, Scala Regia. ery of the Pope in the elephant is not unlike the recognition of a celebrity in a witty caricature. The effect would be more enjoyable by those knew Alexander VII but some of it is expe rienced even by a modern viewer, making the elephant sculp ture one of Bernini's most endearing works. Equine Physiognomy of Horse Riders Reference to comparative physiognomy is even more explicit in Bernini's dramatic confrontations of the expressions of men and animals on his equestrian monuments, one dedi cated to the emperor Constantine the Great [Fig. 29]98 the other to the French king Louis XIV, of which the artist's original terra-cotta model survives [Fig. 33].99 Since antiquity statues of horse riders have been conceived as testifying to social sta 181</page><page sequence="22">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 30) ?Personification of Europe?, c. 1603, woodcut, from C. Ripa, Iconolog?a. tus, but the particular ideologies which Bernini's patrons wished to communicate by the equestrian monuments may be understood in the light of Ripa's manual, where a horse is one of the attributes of the personification of Europe, alluding to the power by which the continent dominates the whole world [Fig. 30].100 As an expression of the political ambitions of the royal horsemen each monument also gives the impression that a dramatic moment in the life of the rider is shared by his rearing steed. However, in each case the relationship trans mits a different message. The monument to the emperor Constantine on the Scala Regia (royal staircase) of the Vatican palace evokes the leg endary vision of the Holy Cross which led to Constantine's recognition of Christianity as the official religion of his empire. The sculpture originally commissioned by Pope Innocent X as 182 an instrument of the religious propaganda of the Counter Reformation, was presumably meant to be placed in a niche at St. Peter's. However, after the Pope's death (in 1655) the proj ect was discontinued. Two years later on the initiative of his successor, Alexander VII, work was resumed, but it protracted for several years and was again interrupted in 1665 when Bernini travelled to France.101 Among the several projects pro posed to him in Paris was the over life size portrait of the French king on horseback, which was meant to improve on the Vatican monument. Bernini began to work on the French commission only in 1670 after he finished the statue of Con stantine. Initially he produced a clay bozzetto. The enlarge ment of this work took several years and the colossal statue was sent to France only in 1685, but when it finally reached Versailles Louis XIV found it unacceptable. A courtier, Dangeau, reports in his diary that the king declared both the horse and the rider so badly done that he resolved not only to remove the sculpture from where it was displayed but even to have it destroyed.102 The motivation of the rejection is not clear. Perhaps the king felt that the heroic rider did not resem ble him, but it is also possible that the Baroque mode of the monument failed to correspond to the new fashions of the French court. The sculpture was saved by Bernini's former student, the sculptor Fran?ois Girardon, who transformed the figure of the king into an ideal portrait of the heroic Roman knight Marcus Curtius, remembered as a moral paradigm of self-sacrifice.103 Since the transmutation involved a partial alteration of the sculpture, especially the head of the royal rider, the preliminary terra-cotta model offers better evidence of the original project allowing one to appreciate Bernini's imaginative elaboration of the physiognomic typology reflect ed in its Vatican prototype. We may start with the supposition that each monument conveys the political ideology of its sponsor. Pope Alexander VM's special interest in the evocation of the miraculous vision of Constantine was related to a tradition according to which the emperor in gratitude for being converted to Christianity, donated Rome to the Popes.104 In the Renaissance the docu ment which supported the legacy was proved to be a medieval fabrication,105 and at approximately the same time the antique equestrian statue which in the Middle Ages was believed to commemorate Constantine, was recognized as representing Marcus Aurelius. The historical gap left by the correct identifi cation of the Roman emperor was presumably to be filled by Bernini's work. However, instead of imitating the commanding pose of Marcus Aurelius the new memorial was to evoke the climactic moment of Constantine's conversion. His spiritual enlightenment is dramatically illustrated by the emperor's pose and by a hidden source of light illuminating his uplifted</page><page sequence="23">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 31) ?Emperor Constantine?, 4th c, bronze coin. Rome, Palazzo dei Conservatori. face. With his usual attention to significant detail Bernini not only copied Constantine's imperial diadem from Roman coinage but also sought to evoke the emperor's physiognom ic traits. He may have referred to a passage about Constan tine's appearances in St. Nicephorous's History of the Empire, but it is more likely that he studied the presumably idealized features of the huge head of Constantine, a surviving fragment of a colossal statue, which can still be seen on the Capitoline Hill.106 Additional evidence could be found on imperial coins, some of which evoke Constantine's mystical experience by showing him looking toward heaven [Fig. 31].107 In adopting the pose for the equestrian monument Bernini may have observed a similarity of Constantine's head seen in profile and Delia Porta's typological illustration of a man resembling a horse [Fig. 32]. The text accompanying the comparison explains that the equine traits indicate the individual's severity, fierceness, energy and a tendency to wrath and fury.108 All these could be ascribed to the emperor, however, Bernini decided to push the typological relationship even further. The 32) ?Man Compared to a Horse?, early 17th c, engraving, from G. Delia Porta, Fisionom?a naturale. equestrian monument not only shows a certain resemblance between Constantine and his horse but suggests that the rear ing horse is aware of the supernatural vision of his rider [Fig. 29]. The invenzione may have been influenced by the story of the conversion of St. Paul (Acts 9:3-4) which Renaissance artists usually illustrated by showing the apostle falling from a frightened horse, for instance on a Sistine Chapel tapestry designed by Raphael, and in Michelangelo's fresco in the Pauline Chapel. Caravaggio painted two versions of the theme. That in the church of Santa Maria del Pop?lo features the horse showing almost human pity for its fallen master, while in an earlier version of the subject (which would have been known to Bernini) the apostle's horse seems to be terri fied by the supernatural occurrence.109 The suggestion that a horse is fully capable of sharing the visionary experience of its rider is even more explicit on the monument to Constantine. In the context of the ideology propagated by Counter Refor mation the dramatic effect could perhaps be understood as a suggestion that the grace of spiritual enlightenment is uni versally available. The relationship of the rider and his horse is also made clear in the model for the equestrian statue of Louis XIV [Fig. 33]. The correspondence of the cascade of freely falling locks framing the king's face on both sides and the long mane of his steed suggests a typological comparison but in this case the 183</page><page sequence="24">AVIGDOR W. G. POS?Q_ 33) G.-L. Bernini, ?Model of the Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV?, 1669-1670, terracotta. Rome, Galleria Borghese. horse does not seem to share the emotional experience of its rider. Rather the contrary, the dramatic expression of the rear ing horse emphasizes the sense of dignified control conveyed by the king. The difference between the expressions of Louis XIV and Constantine was of course deliberate. From contem porary reports we know that in delivering the royal commis sion Colbert instructed Bernini to make an equestrian statue of the king similar to that of the emperor but not to duplicate the earlier work. Bernini assured the French minister that the royal portrait would be completely different since Constantine was represented in the act of receiving the vision of the Cross, while the king will be shown in the attitude of "majesty and command".110 Bernini apparently developed the concept of his statue in response to the king's admonition that he was entrusting him with his glory. The remark led to a suggestion that the equestrian portrait was intended to commemorate the recent victories of the French armies in the Low Countries and Spain.111 The military supremacy of Louis XIV would have been recorded by flags of the conquered lands being placed under the hooves of the royal steed. The preliminary bozzetto does not show any flags; its political message is conveyed only by the baton of command and the reins with which he 34) ?Head of Louis XIV? (detail of Fig. 33). restricts the charge of his mount. In the light of the aforemen tioned illustration of Ripa's handbook [Fig. 30] the control of the horse may have been meant to be understood as an allu sion to the French domination of Europe. Since Bernini made the bozzetto in his Roman studio his rendering of Louis XIV's features was presumably based on recollections of what the king looked like when he posed for a marble bust which Bernini carved in the course of his stay in Paris.112 The bust, considered one of Bernini's finest works, departs from the traditional effigies of rulers by featuring a windswept drapery which envelops the upper part of the torso and intensifies the effect of the sitter's passionate inter est in what is taking place in the distance. Bernini's suggestion of the king's inner energy won an immediate approval at the 184</page><page sequence="25">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI 35) R. Nanteuil, ?Portrait of King Louis XIV?, late 17th c, engraving. French court where interest in human expressions was stimu lated by Descartes's treatise on the "Passions of the Soul"113 and by the public lectures on passions which Charles Le Brun, the first painter of the king, delivered to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.114 Le Brun's lessons were later given the form of a treatise in which he declared that an artist wish ing to express the passions must be aware that since the "motions of the soul" agitate the features, the inner sentiments which motivate a person's actions should be represented by mimicry.115 Though the term "motions of the soul" indicates Le Brun's debt the humanistic theories of artistic expression, the importance he assigned to dynamic facial mimicry suggests that a person's individuality is manifest in the mobility of his features rather than in their morphology. Bernini seems to have responded to the French theory by endowing the bust of Louis XIV with an expression of pride combined with a strong Suggestion of an inner stimulation. Some people however, objected that the portrait was not quite true to the original. Other, more realistic portraits of the king, suggest that the crit icism of was not unjustified but Bernini defended his work say ing that it was meant to convey the idea of the king's sublime majesty, which the artist felt to be more relevant than mere likeness. Bernini's concept of what a royal portrait should convey was further developed in his terra-cotta model for the equestri an monument. A comparison of the head of the royal rider [Fig. 34] with a portrait of Louis XIV by the then popular French engraver Robert Nanteuil [Fig. 35]116 shows that rather than seeking to produce a realistic likeness Bernini again created a stylized version of the king's features. Modern writers have noted that the king wears a classical armour and rides without stirrups as the ancients did, leading to the supposition that the colossal statue was meant to evoke Alexander the Great riding the wild horse Bucephalus. The fact that Louis XIV was in fact attracted to Alexander whom he considered as his paradigm led to a suggestion that the French monarch actually resem bled the Macedonian ruler whose features were known from antique coinage [Fig. 36].117 The resemblance which, accord ing to contemporary reports, was remarked upon by Bernini while he carved the king's bust, was elaborated in the equestri an portrait. The features of the royal rider with its straight nose and wavy hair can in fact be compared to a conventional like ness of Alexander. For somebody who, like Bernini, was aware of the theory of physiognomic typology the resemblance might be subject to a further interpretation. The similarity of the profile of Alexander the Great to Delia Porta's illustration of a horse like human type [Fig. 32] could be extended to the somewhat horsy features of French king, implying that both rulers were predestined for magnificence. Bernini emphasized the royal rider's resemblance to Alexander by substituting the elaborate courtly wig which Louis XIV wore on formal occasions by freely falling locks [Fig. 34]. The suggestive effect of the hair style is especially evident when one compares the king's head with an ancient coin showing the Macedonian ruler as the sun-god Helios [Fig. 37].118 Bernini who of course was aware that Louis XIV was called the Roi soleil (Sun King) seems to have adopted the en face formula of the sun-god for the royal rider. Though the equestrian monument is meant to be seen in a side view the king does not look in the direction of his mount's advance. Bernini obviously expected that the king's head turned frontally toward the viewer would evoke the radiant image of the sun -god. The multilevel conceptual association of the French king with the allegoric effigy of the Hellenistic ruler may thus be seen as yet another case of Bernini's use of physiognomic typology as means of communication. 185</page><page sequence="26">AVIGDOR W.

Though the contrast between the calm face of Louis XIV and the furious expression of his horse was carefully transferred to the colossal version of the sculpture, the king disliked the work. Since no reason is reported for the objec tion, it has been suggested that the sculpture showing him as he looked two decades earlier, no longer resembled him. Afflicted by gout and other infirmities the king may have felt that the energy of conveyed by the equestrian portrait might be seen as a comment on his decayed physical condition. It is also possible that the baroque exuberance of Bernini's sculpture seemed dated in the light of the gradual emer gence of a classicist taste. However, since the rearing horse was later plagiarized by Le Brun in the Monument to the Glory of Louis XIV it seems to me that the disesteem of Bernini's work was motivated by the Helios-like imperturba bility of king's features. The expressionless face which Bernini felt would convey the timelessness of the sun-king's majesty, apparently failed to respond to the by then more widespread expectations of artistic interpretation of inner passions. 37) ?Alexander the Great as Helios?, silver coin from Rhodes, 3rd-2nd c. B.C. Boston, Museum of Fine Arts. Conclusion: Physiognomy as Artistic Means of Communication The discussion of some physiognomic aspects of the works of Bernini allows us to formulate several conclusions. One is the notion that his interest in human expression evolved from the humanistic theory that the 'movements of the soul' are reflected in gestures and mimicry, which eventually developed into the theory of the artistic communication of the passions. Bernini was also aware of the recent revival of the ancient theo ry of the diagnostic aspect of the morphology of human faces, whose similarity to certain animals was thought to indicate a correspondence of behavioural modes. Besides enhancing the characterization of human figures the reference to these texts also involved the assignment of human expressions to the animals represented. The zoomorphic typology is in many cases reinforced by allusions to the allegorical significance ascribed to certain animals in contemporary handbooks of iconology. Bernini's artistic rendering of the physiognomic types as well as of the expressiveness of the animals assume 186</page><page sequence="27">_ON PHYSIOGNOMIC COMMUNICATION IN BERNINI the character of non-verbal communication. Since the artistic representations are related to contemporary theories of expression the appreciation of what the works convey requires some knowledge their cultural background. Comparative phys iognomy is no longer as popular as it was in Bernini's time and the same is also true of the texts on animal symbolism but ref erence to these traditions not only offers the modern viewer an opportunity to look at the works of Bernini as he meant them to be seen but also to understand them in the way they would have been understood by his public. 187 1 All modern biographies refer to Filippo Baldinucci's Vita del Cavali?re Lorenzo Bernini, scultore, architetto, pittore (Florence, 1682), ed.

In some cultures she-goats were worshipped as incarnations of the universal World Mother and symbol of nutrition and mystic initiation. In the Orphic tradition the souls of neophytes were said to be nurtured by goat's milk and the accession to the divine grace was compared to a kid in goat's milk. A vestige of the rejection of this notion seems to survive in the biblical proscription of cooking a kid in his mother's milk. 15 G.
