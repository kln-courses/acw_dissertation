<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wood, A. W. Kant's Rational Theology. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1979. 156 pp. $9.75?Wood aims at correcting an undue emphasis upon the negative or critical aspect of Kant's theo logical thought. He seeks to achieve this object through two distinct inquiries: (1) into the positive component of Kant's rational theology, chiefly the account of the ens realissimium as the necessary ideal assumed by reason in its attempt to arrive at a complete determina tion of the properties of things, presented in the "Ideal of Reason" (esp. sections 1-2) in the "Dialectic" of the first Critique, (A567/B595 A583/B611); (2) into the strengths and weaknesses of the criticisms of the ontological and natural proofs of the existence of a supreme being, found chiefly in sections 3-7 of the "Ideal of Reason" (A583/ B611-A642/B670). The author here is centrally concerned with salvag ing the ontological argument from Kant's famous and still highly re garded attack. These two inquiries correspond to the two main parts of the text (part 1, "The Idea of God," and part 2, "The Three The istic Proofs"). The second part also contains a discussion and criticism of the role which theistic concepts play in the regulative idea of the unity of the laws of nature, as discussed in the "Appendix" to the "Dialectic" (A642/B670 ff.). The author is perhaps correct in maintaining that these passages of the Critique have hitherto received little understanding, sympathy, and even attention from Kant scholars. He also expresses a certain desire to show the respectibility of rational theology, much discredited today in both philosophical and theological circles, by means of a presen tation of Kant's views. He believes this can be achieved with the help of Kant, in spite of Kant's reputation as the great destroyer of metaphysics, and therewith, of rational (speculative and natural) the ology. In other words, his central concern is to show that Kant is not simply the destroyer of metaphysical theology, but that Kant is con</page><page sequence="2">782 DEREK CROSS AND STAFF tinuing the "tradition of rational theology" which, in Wood's account, is unbroken from Plato to Leibniz and Wolff. Kant had a "profound sympathy with the tradition he criticized" (p. 17), and in fact, was unable to think of God in any other terms than that of the ens realis simum of this tradition. Yet Wood is emphatic on the point that Kant denied that there could be a speculative or theoretical science of the ens realissimum, and thus opposed himself to Descartes, Leibniz, and Wolff on this question. Wood seems to argue that Kant held the ens realissimum to be the concept of God which is prescribed by the nature of human reason, without having objective reality. Hu man reason is in need of the idea of an infinite reality in order to conceive finite reality. Wood at the same time notes that this position is strikingly similar to Descartes' own alleged proof of God's existence in the Third Meditation (pp. 34-35). The author is not primarily interested, therefore, in Kant's discussion of the "illusory" and "dia lectical" nature of this concept, and therefore, he is not chiefly inter ested in the relation of the "Ideal of Reason" to the whole problematic of the "Dialectic" and the critique of metaphysics. The author maintains that he acquires considerable support for the claim that the "Ideal" contains a positive theological teaching, from the Lectures on Philosophical Religion, edited and first published by Karl P?litz in the early nineteenth century, and of which Wood has himself been a translator and commentator in a separate volume. Thus his arguments are drawn largely from the Critique in this volume, and it must be on the basis of the passages in the Critique that one at tempts an evaluation of Wood's argument. The positive outcome of Kant's discussion of the ideal of the ens realissimum appears in Wood's account to be twofold: (1) Kant described a concept which arises in evitably in human reason, and which is an object of "theoretical curi osity," although not objective or the basis of a theoretical science; (2) the same concept as described by Kant provides moral theology, the true core of Kantian theology, with a list of abstract and non anthropomorphic attributes which are morally more acceptable than the "empirical" divine attributes of conventional or historical religion; in other words, speculative theology provides a propaedeutic to moral theology or rational religion, as grounded in pure rational morality. Perhaps the second of these outcomes is the more important in Wood's view, for he strongly underlines that rational theology in the form of moral religion is at the very foundation of Kant's critical philosophy, and is not an afterthought, as is often supposed (p. 20). But two things militate against this interpretation of Wood's intention. He devotes more time to the aspect of Kant's discussion which appeals to "theoretical curiosity," than he does to the practical import of this discussion. And in doing so, he somewhat undermines his own claim, and Kant's, that speculative theology is of no significance at all for theoretical (scientific) purposes of reason (cf. A636/B664), therewith weakening the thesis of the "primacy of practical reason" in Kant's whole endeavor. In particular, it appears to this reviewer that Wood has overlooked Kant's distinction between the "idea of the sum of reality," which reason can employ in its determination of particular realities, and</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 783 the "ideal" of the ens realissimum which is the "dialectical" and "il lusory" hypostatization of the "idea," into a supreme being, which Kant says is of no use at all to reason for theoretical purposes (A580/ B606). Having overlooked this crucial point, Wood believes that Kant has regarded particular realities as "limitations" or "divisions" of the supreme being, and that therewith he has developed a line of thought suggested by the metaphysics of Leibniz and Wolff. But Kant makes clear that the language of "limitation" is inappropriate, since the idea of the sum of reality is only a concept and in no sense a thing; it is also wrong to argue, as Wood does, that the sum of reality has nou menal status, when employed for theoretical purposes, for it is pre cisely when it is ascribed such status that it becomes "dialectical" and useless (A581/B609-A583/B611). In sum, one must argue that the "Ideal" contains no positive speculative theology, but only a "dialecti cal" theology. In spite of this significant shortcoming of the book's argument, which is related to a general reluctance on Wood's part to admit the radicality of Kant's position, one can say that it has value as a reminder of the centrality of the issue of the relation of religion to metaphysics in Kant's philosophy, an issue which is indeed largely neglected in studies of Kant.?R.L.V.</page></plain_text>
