<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARION TRUE A kouros at the Getty Museum THE opportunity to add a complete archaic kouros' to the existing corpus of Greek monumental sculpture has come rarely over the past fifty years, most recently in 1972 with the excavation of the kouros and kore in Merenda, just outside Athens.2 The statue of Aristodikos,3 now in the National Museum of Athens, was discovered in Mesogeia in 1944; and the Anavysos kouros (Fig.3),4 which was dug up and removed from Greece illicitly in 1936, was recovered from Paris in 1937.5 The chances of finding a hitherto-unknown statue outside Greece have been even 'The fundamental publication on the subject is still G.M.A. RICHTER: Kouroi, 3rd ed., New York [1970].

The last American museum to enjoy this privilege was the Metropolitan Museum, which purchased its very early kouros in 1932.6 The Getty Museum's recent acqui- sition of a well-preserved archaic statue of a youth (Fig.2) is thus an event of major importance for the history of archaic sculpture.' Few types of monumental Greek stone figures exist in large enough numbers to permit detailed study of' their chronological development and regional styles.

Kouros, left profile of Fig.2. dence for the continuous production of these statues for well over a century in various parts of the Hellenic world has allowed scholars to attempt to define the characteristics of various local workshops as well as more general stylistic trends and periods of innovation. The original purpose of many of these statues is obscure.9 It is still uncertain whether they were intended to represent humans or deities. The colossal proportions of some surely suggest that they represented the latter to the ancients, while the fact that others stood over graves seems to indicate that they were intended to commemorate mortals. Most have been found in association with either tombs or sanc- tuaries, but they do not appear in specific contexts with any degree of predictability. The provincial sanctuary of Apollo Ptoieus in Boeotia, for example, has produced fragments of approximately 120 kouroi; '0 the sanctuary of Olympia, site of the greatest of the panhellenic athletic competitions whose victors were often celebrated with elaborate monuments erected in their honour at other sites, has yielded fragmentary evidence of only one."I Korai, 9See RIDGWAY, op.cit. at note I above, pp.49-59 for a thorough discussion of recent theories with earlier references.

I should like to thank the author for allowing me to read his manuscript before publication. estimates the total number of kouroi found at the sanctuary to be approximately 120; as he points out, this is an enormous majority of all known kouroi, since the total number of surviving figures exclusive of the Ptoon group was 158 at his date of publication.

Details from the kouros (Fig.2), showing the front and back of the head. the female counterparts of the kouroi, have been found in large numbers on the Acropolis in Athens, but no canonical kouros figure (that is, a nude male with hands by his sides and both feet flat on the base, the left foot advanced) has been discovered on that site." 2 It is unlikely that questions about the identification and purpose of many pieces of archaic sculpture will ever be answered conclusively. Fortunately, however, the survival of parts of more than 200 kouroi and a similar number of korai in various media has permitted the analysis of specific anatomical and stylistic features that help to date and classify new examples that appear, such as the kouros in the Getty Museum. The previously unpublished statue was originally brought on loan to the Museum in September 1983 and subjected to fourteen months of examination and research, as well as scientific and legal investigation, before its purchase. The Museum's conservators then spent another eighteen months studying and testing the stone in order to develop an innovative system for reconstruction and display.'3 At last, standing upright without external support, prepared for exhibition, the kouros appears as it was intended to be seen. It can now assume its place within the series of known figures of this type. Of the more than two hundred kouroi that exist, only a very small number, perhaps thirteen, are nearly as well preserved. 14 The classification and dating of all such fig- ures, however, is based primarily on the anatomical details that survive. Since these are not always visible in photo- graphs, we must describe the Getty kouros (Figs.2,5-10) in some detail. Measuring 2.06 m. (or 6'9") from the top of its head to the bottom of the oval plinth, the figure was broken in ancient times into five pieces; two additional breaks, detaching the proper right arm and hand, appear to be modern. The tip of the nose and the glans of the penis are lost, along with a large chip from the left ankle and another from the left inner wrist; small amounts of surface have been lost around the breaks, and there is some minor abrasion. Otherwise, the statue is complete. 15 2lIbid., p.49, n.3. "jerry Podany, the Conservator of Antiquities at the Getty Museum, and a team of geologists, rock mechanics, and seismic engineers developed a new method of reconstruction. The large, rigid steel rods traditionally inserted to join the broken limbs have been replaced with high-strength stainless steel cables that are flexible and much smaller in diameter. These cables, held taut by high-tension springs beneath the base of the statue, provide some movement between the joins in case of seismic activity. The joins are locked in place by acrylic interfaces that replace the marble surface lost at the breaks in the process of weathering. The entire statue stands on a large steel base, faced with granite, that is raised on ball bearings. Within the hollow interior of the rectangular structure, an inverted flawless steel dome covers a spring-loaded centring device on a steel plate attached to the floor beneath the base. Thus, the entire construction - statue and base - can move safely in any direction in case of lateral seismic thrust. As the powerful spring of the centring device is compressed, however, it will present enough gradual resistance to move the base back to its original position. A complete publication of the conservation process is in preparation. '4'l'hese thirteen figures are RICHTER, op.cit. at note 1 above, nos. 1-2, 12 a-b, 14, 63, 73, 86, 135, 136, 145, 165; plus the Merenda kouros, published by MASTrROKOSrAS, op.cit. at note 2 above. Of these, Richter's No. 14 is the unfinished, non-canonical Kriophoros on Thasos; No.145 is the kouros from the Ptoon sanctuary, now National Museum No. 12, which is not preserved below the knees. 'l'he feet and oval base associated with it are generally accepted, but cannot be proven to belong. '"The actual sequence of the damages is not clear. Some damage to the centre of the forehead must have occurred during carving or soon after, fobr the flawed curl to the proper left of the part was carefully reshaped in order that it not disfigure the face. The nose and penis may also have been broken before the figure finally fell. The pattern of breaks at the knees and ankles suggests that a strong force, twisting from proper right to left, caused the destruction. 6</page><page sequence="5">A KOUROS AT THE GETTY MUSEUM In stance, the Malibu kouros follows the canonical up- right, rigidly frontal pose. Though the left leg is advanced, the weight of the body is evenly distributed between the two feet, which rest firmly on the base. The arms hang by the sides, detached from the torso from well above the slightly bent elbows to just over the wrists; the loosely- closed hands are attached to the thighs at their point of broadest extent, with recessed rectangular areas of stone filling the spaces where the flesh would not actually touch. Except for the bowless fillet that is bound around the crown of his head, the beardless figure is without attribute (Figs.8 and 9). His thick wig of rather summarily stylised hair, bulging noticeably beneath the restraining band, is carefully arranged in sixteen long, beaded strands that run back over the top of the head to fall behind the ears. Four- teen of these tresses end across the upper back in a row of triangular pendants. Ten thick curls frame the forehead symmetrically, parting in the centre so that their spiralling ends turn outward toward the ears. The edges of the curls along the central part and the volute just left of centre on the forehead are marred by an obvious fissure in the stone that continues onto the face. Centuries of weathering have surely exaggerated the flaw, but it must originally have created problems for either the sculptor who carved the figure, or another ancient craftsman not far removed in time from the sculptor, for the edges of both curls and lower contour of the left volute had to be reworked as a result of the crevice and differ noticeably from the crisp execution of the rest. The fleshy, asymmetrical face is sensitive and refined, buoyant in its joyful expression and almost feminine in its sweetness. The eyes, set nearly horizontally beneath the curving zygomatic arches, display well-articulated tear- ducts, but they are without caruncle. The smooth lips of the small mouth are curved in a gentle smile; the centre of neither lip is marked, although, when seen in profile, the upper lip protrudes noticeably over the lower, and both lack sharply defined edges. The ears, which are placed unnaturally high on the head, do not match each other in either shape or location. Among the most distinctive anatomical features of the Getty kouros, and surely the most important for the determination of his proportions, are the narrow shoulders. The neck appears deceptively columnar, though there are actually tangible indications of the sternocleidal mastoids running diagonally downward from either side. On the chest, anatomical details have been reduced to a minimum. The pectorals, defined at the tops and in the centre by the perpendicular intersection of the horizontal clavicles and the sternum, are large and unusually flat, roughly u-shaped in form, with the nipples (one of which is missing) placed close to the bottom near the outer edges. Beneath them, the epigastral arch, which is the lower boundary of the thorax, is defined by a curving, shallow depression that continues on below the waist, forming a large, sym- metrical oval within the abdomen. The rectus abdominus in the upper half of this oval is divided into three horizontal sections, the lowest of which ends level with the navel and just below the slender waistline created by the tapering iliac crests. The protruding rounded surface of the navel is covered by a fold of flesh on the upper half. Below the navel, only the penis, the glans of which is missing, inter- rupts the curve of the groin, separated by a thin fold of flesh at its root. The anatomy of the back is treated with even less speci- ficity than the front. The scapulae are represented as large, flat planes. A central furrow marks the spine, and two additional depressions spring from the lower inside corners of the scapulae, running outward down the lower back to form the long diagonal latissimi dorsi. The area of the coccyx at the base of the spine is oddly featureless, without any suggestion of surface detail. Seen from directly behind, the buttocks appear com- pressed and almost rectangular. Viewed in profile, how- ever, they prove to be full and rounded in form, sloping above into the hollow of the lower back and giving way below to the muscular thighs. These thighs are a startling contrast with the slender torso and narrow shoulders. Seen from the front, their taut contours do not contradict the statue's generally slim proportions; yet, in three-quarter or profile view, they are unexpectedly broad; for it is here that the sculptor has concentrated much of the figure's impressive strength and energy. The knee joint is indicated on the back of each leg by a small horizontal incision. The knees themselves, when viewed from the front, are clearly though abstractly de- fined. The musculature of the lower legs, unlike that of the thighs, is defined in graphic detail. Pronounced wedge- shaped ridges indicate the tibiae that bow outward slightly around the calves. This bowed effect is further exaggerated by the deeply-cut curve on the inside of each calf outlining the powerful gastrocnemius. On the outsides of the calves, the peroneals are indicated, though less obviously, by two vertical depressions cut into the surface of the marble. Of all the features of the Getty kouros, perhaps the most sensitively modelled are its feet (Fig. 10). Resting flat on their irregular oval plinth, they are not set parallel to the longest axis of the ellipse. Rather, the end of the recessed heel and the longest second toe of the advanced foot are ac- tually set on this axis. The ankles are correctly formed, and a slight nodule clearly defines the heel. In spite of the obvious weathering, the stone surface still preserves the indications of the metatarsals of the second, third and fourth toes. The top of the oval base is finished to a level surface on which the marks of the claw chisel are still visible, and the exterior edges have been worked horizontally with the claw chisel to a fairly regular curve. On the underside, the plinth is only roughly picked to a flat surface; some evidence of the use of the claw chisel remains here as well. Although the formula of presentation is generally the same - a rigidly frontal, upright figure standing with both feet flat on the ground, with one foot ahead of the other - no two preserved kouroi, with the exception of the twins Kleobis and Biton,'6 are exactly or even nearly alike in size or details. Yet, the almost identical proportions of the figures of Dermys and Kittylos,'7 rendered in high relief on their grave stele, demonstrate quite clearly that archaic Greek '16RICHTER, op.cit. at note 1 above, nos.12 a and b. 17Ibid., No.11; for details of the measurements, see E. GURALNICK: 'The Pro- portions of Kouroi', American Journal of Archaeology, Vol.82 [1978], p.461, n.7. 7</page><page sequence="6">A KOUROS AT THE GETTY MUSEUM sculptors were capable of fairly accurate reproduction even at this period. Thus, the individuality of each kouros was clearly an important characteristic of the figure type. At the same time, given the standardisation of their pose and the typical absence of attributes, it is not unusual to find that many kouroi share similar features: beaded tresses, for example, are common to many figures, as are curls framing the forehead and a fillet that encircles the crown of the head. Variation was a natural result of the sculptors' constant efforts to improve the accuracy of anatomical rendering. Nevertheless, anatomical accuracy serves as no measure of the strength, quality or originality of execution. As Langlotz remarked, 'It is not a question of whether or not the artist has come close to his model in nature on the basis of the individual elements, but if the vital strength can be detected in his manner, if the seed which holds together a work in its innermost core can be uncovered.'18 Clearly, the effect of the sculptor of each kouros was to create a unique work of art using a common vocabulary of forms and features. The greatest kouroi are those that man- age, in addition, to infuse the stone figure with a vitality that belies both the material and the constant repetition of type. Thus it is not surprising that numerous parallels exist for the various features of the Getty kouros among the well-known surviving figures of this type. In fact, on first impression, the new figure looks disarmingly familiar, re- calling as it does specific individual elements of some known kouroi, while bearing a more general similarity to others. The superficial resemblance to the kouros from Anavysos (Fig.3),19 now in the National Museum in Athens, has been stressed by many scholars. Close comparison of the two shows, however, that they are distinctly different in most details. Their proportions are completely at odds, the kouros from Anavysos being much broader in both shoulders and hips; their hairstyles are markedly different, since the top of the head of the Anavysos figure is a smooth undulating surface, and the ends of his beaded tresses form little curls; though both faces are fleshy, the lower part of the face of the Anavysos figure is distinctly heavier, appearing to be more mature. In profile, the jaw of the Anavysos statue protrudes to the level of the forehead, while the lower lip and chin of the Malibu kouros recede noticeably. The graphic definition of the musculature in the lower legs, the articulation of the abdomen, especially the rectus abdominus above the navel, but also the shallow depression that emphasises the roundness of the belly below, the plastic treatment of the navel, and the fold of flesh at the top of the penis, are quite similar. The inner thighs of the Anavysos figure are much more knowledgeably carved, however, with the graciles distinguished from the vasti interni by the distinct diagonal of the sartorii. In addition, the distance between the navel and the top of the penis is significantly shorter in the Anavysos statue, since the curve of the groin is in fact much more shallow. Tlhe overall slenderness of the proportions, the sloping shoulders, the narrow waist, and the small hips of the Getty kouros are closest to those of the kouros from Tenea 'Fig.4), now in Munich.20 Though smaller in size and earlier in date, this figure offers the best parallel for the navel centrally placed within the abdominal oval (which is considerably narrower), equidistant between the bottom of the thorax and the fold at the top of the penis; and also for the thighs that appear surprisingly broad in the side views, as well as for the compressed, rectangular buttocks. The stylised beaded hair of the Malibu kouros, with fourteen triangular pendants at the back, recalls the hair of the Sounion kouroi,21 the early torso and head from the Kerameikos,22 all now in the National Museum in Athens, and the kouros in the Metropolitan Museum of New York.23 The expanding contours of the hair that seem to strain the confining fillet are closer to the outlines of the hair of the kouros from Keratea, now National Museum No.1904,24 the kouros in Florence,25 or the figure from the island of Keos, now in the National Museum.26 For the large, doughy curls that turn outward to surround the forehead, the kouros from Keos provides the closest com- parison among the stone kouroi;27 this figure also shows a similar flatness in the rendering of the chest. Surprisingly enough, the overall effect of the delicate features of the face of the Malibu youth, especially seen in profile, are closest to those of the so-called Peplos kore, No.679 in the Acropolis Museum.28 The ears, carved with a simplicity and shallowness that is perhaps unexpected, are rather similar to those of the Munich kouros from Attica.29 Their lopsided placement on the sides of the head is a feature found again in the statue from Tenea. In addition to their similarity with the Tenea kouros, the blocky buttocks and heavy thighs may be compared with those of the fragmentary lower torso from the Piraeus gate, now in the Kerameikos Museum in Athens.30 And finally, the feet and attached plinth are most similar to those now associated with the kouros from the Ptoon sanc- tuary, now Athens National Museum No.12,31 although the sides of the plinth of Ptoon 12 are worked at an oblique angle rather than horizontally.32 All of these associations should help to date the kouros '8'Nicht nach Einzelformen ist zu fragen, ob der Kiinstler dem Naturvorbild nahekommt, sondern es ist die gestaltende Kraft in ihrer Artung zu erkennen, der Kern aufzuspuren, der ein Werk "im Innersten zusammenhdlt".'

The most useful established chrono- logical framework is still that created by Gisela Richter in Kouroi. In spite of her over-strict adherence to the notion that the development in Greek anthropomorphic sculpture of ever greater naturalism and anatomical accuracy could be plotted chronologically as a fairly straightforward pro- gression, her groupings of the known statues have proven with time to be fairly reliable.33 The most numerous par- allels for the various features of the Getty kouros can be found among her Anavysos-Ptoon 12 Group, which she dated to 540-520 B.C.34 Yet the Getty kouros does pose some serious contradictions to Richter's theory of anatomical development. As we have noted, the decorative treatment of the hair is actually more compatible in style with the locks of the very early Sounion Group, dated by Richter to 615-590 B.C.35 And in addition to individual parallels of minor details with representatives of other groups, there are the very strong associations with the Tenea figure that gives its name to the Tenea-Volom- andra Group, dated 575-550 B.C.36 This combination of features certainly does not agree with the principles of consistent development established by Richter's chronology. It produces instead the confusion which Langlotz cautioned would result from any expectation that all features of a statue should follow the same rate of chronological development.37 The mixture of apparently conflicting advanced and retarded elements comes from the sculptor's inability to gather in one work all of the advances of the moment. Langlotz suggested that some anachronisms should naturally be anticipated, especially if the artist has joined together features influenced by various sources that is, if the piece is eclectic in style. In such a case, the work of art should be dated by its most advanced details. Thus, the Getty kouros can be dated on the basis of its feet, which are its most anatomically accurate feature and for which the closest parallels are the feet and base linked with the Ptoon figure, now National Museum No. 12, that gives its name to Richter's Anavysos-Ptoon 12 Group. 38 A second issue raised by the eclectic nature of the Getty kouros is the difficulty in localising the style. While Richter preferred to ignore the geographical centres of archaic 10.

They have had some success, There is tentative agreement on the general characteristics for the workshops of Attica,42 the Peloponnesus,43 Boeotia,44 Naxos,45 Paros,46 Samos,47 and Ionia,48 but there is often 3"A significant observation on Richter's early chronology is made by HARRISON, op.cit. at note 1 above, pp.3-5, where she suggests that the Sounion and Tenea- Volomandra Groups need not be so distant from one another in time; she does not accept the Orchomenos-Thera Group that separates them as a distinct group that represents a separate period in time.

The difficulties of clear definitions of local style are of course complicated primarily by the lottery of survival.49 The Getty kouros does not fit comfortably into any one regional style, but appears to exhibit the characteristics of three: the coherent sense of underlying anatomical struc- ture is commonly associated with Attica (cf. the Anavysos kouros); the combination of elegant slenderness with mus- cular thighs and compressed buttocks recalls the Tenea kouros - usually taken to represent a Corinthian, or at least a Pelopponesian workshop; and the feet and base are closest to those of Figure No. 12 from the Ptoon sanctuary in Boeotia. At a date of 540-20 B.C., however, this apparent eclecticism may in fact be the result of the 'blurring' of regional distinctions that occurred around 530 B.C. One clue to the identification of the statue's regional source might have been provided by the identification of the marble from which it is carved. The scientific analysis, however, suggests the marble comes from the north-east corner of the island of Thasos,52 and this possibility has led only to further questions. As the marble-rich island of Paros dominated Thasos from the early seventh century onwards53 and provided the primary stylistic vocabulary for the marble pieces made on Thasos,54 one might expect to find some features that could be linked with sculpture that comes from Paros itself and is undeniably Parian in style. The apparent absence of any such features is prob- lematic. Given the lack of any traces of Parian style, the possibility that the stone was exported to be worked elsewhere must be considered. At present, however, there is no evidence for the exportation of Thasian marble in the archaic period. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine why a sculptor would prefer to work in the inferior Thasian dolomitic stone when good Parian or Naxian stone was readily available. Yet, as marble studies progress, the identification of stone provenances is presenting some surprises. Most identifi- cations of Naxian and Parian marble have been done op- tically, and good Thasian stone can look very like them.55 It has been established by scientific analysis that the Severe Style 'thrones' in Boston and Rome, both found in Rome, are made of Thasian marble,56 and recent information suggests that the newly discovered Charioteer from Mozia may also be carved from Thasian marble.57 It is not difficult to believe that future scientific analyses of stone may find that archaic pieces carved from Thasian marble have long been known but unrecognised. It is also possible that the dolomitic stone of the Getty statue, which, when compared with other analysed quarries, has a stable iso- topic profile closest to that of the acropolis quarry on Thasos, may ultimately prove to be from a quarry as yet unknown or unstudied. The Getty figure, in its remarkable state of preservation, does not fit comfortably into the standard chronological sequence determined by the anatomy, or into any one re- gional style. Since, in addition, the identification of the stone from which it appears to have been be sculpted is at odds with its stylistic eclecticism, the question has naturally been raised as to whether it is genuine. Is it not, perhaps, a pastiche made by a modern forger with access to Thasian stone, which has reportedly been quarried from the acropolis this century, using illustrations in Richter's book, Kouroi, and plaster casts of figures from Munich and the National Museum of Athens? The results of analyses of both the statue's proportions and its weathered surface speak against this possibility. In the first study, various dimensions of the Getty kouros were taken to determine the proportional ratios of various parts of the body to the whole.58 Scholars have long wondered whether the Egyptian second canon of proportions, the systematic standardisation of the proportions of the human figure that is well-known from grids preserved on drawings and unfinished sculpture, was influential in Greek archaic sculpture.59 Most attempts to prove its importance have employed the measurements of only one or two Greek statues in support of their arguments, however, and until recently, no conclusive demonstration of the widespread use of the canon had been presented.60 The descriptive measurements of twenty-four of the most complete kouroi have now been collected and analysed with the aid of a computer to establish their relationships to one another, to the Egyptian second canon, and to the proportions of a hypothetical average male. The results indicate that the Egyptian second canon was influential in Greece for most of the sixth century B.C., but by no means consistently or predictably applied. Among the known kouroi, the kouros from the Ptoon 49RIDGWAY, op.cit. at note 1 above, pp.47-48, points out that the provincial sanctuary of Apollo Ptoieus in Boeotia has yielded approximately 120 kouroi or kouros fragments, while the entire Peloponnesus is represented by only some ten pieces. She also (p.64) acknowledges the development of an 'International Style' by about 530 B.C., the period around which the Getty Kouros may be dated. 50BUSCHOR, op.cit. at note 1 above, p.49; also N.

When compared with their statistical analyses, the proportions of the Getty kouros are closest to those of National Museum No. 12, although the statue is neither visually nor proportionally a copy or an imitation.6' It is difficult to believe that the Getty kouros is the result of a modern application of a two- dimensional grid system of proportions whose widespread importance for Greek sculpture has only recently been established. To accept that a modern sculptor, translating this grid system into three dimensions, could create a unique, compositionally coherent statue that agrees in its abstract proportions, but not its actual appearance, with the incomplete kouros from the Ptoon sanctuary, National Museum No. 12 is impossible. Other evidence that supports the statue's authenticity is provided by the surface incrustation. Because the oddly pale appearance of the surface of the stone of the Getty figure has been troublesome to virtually every observer, extensive scientific studies have been carried out to test its antiquity.'2 Core samples were taken from within the breaks at the proper left shoulder and right knee for analysis. In cross section, they show the exposed area of the break to be an ancient weathered surface. Through the gradual leaching out of the magnesium present in the dolomitic marble of the core, the stone has undergone the process of de-dolomitisation. The very regular crystalline crust that is now present on the surface of the break is almost pure calcite. Replicas taken with acetate peels of the untested, worked surfaces of the statue showed features identical with the calcite crust. To prove that this delicate, uniform surface could not have been artificially applied, ratios of three different stable isotopes were analysed in both the calcite crust and in the dolomite core, and they proved to be the same in both. In addition, photographs taken under great magnification actually show the dolomite crystals in the process of trans- formation. Thus, the calcite crust has to be a true alteration product of the dolomite. Since the application of either an acid or alkaline solution to the stone would attack the cal- cite selectively, the possibility that this alteration surface could be produced intentionally by chemical means can be excluded. The process of de-dolomitisation in this statue could have occurred only in conditions of neutral ground water over a period of centuries. In theory, this change could have been induced more rapidly by heat or pressure, but in practical fact, the magnitude of heat and pressure required to produce the uniform alteration surface over such a large object would make such an effort impossible by means known to science at present. 63 The iron oxide staining of the surface was examined for any indications that it might have been applied in recent times. The core sample taken from the break in the right knee for the analysis of the surface included part of a large fissure that extended into the core. Within this fissure, particles of the iron-bearing clay were found to have mi- grated deeply and to have become firmly attached to dolo- mite crystals, additional evidence that suggests centuries of burial. The irregular staining and floury appearance of the stone (which cannot have been extensively cleaned with any harsh chemical that would have affected the calcite crust) can be explained by the stone's lack of porosity. Unlike calcite marble, the dolomite marble presents a dense surface that does not permit much penetration. Finally, the evidence provided by the figural proportions and scientific analysis is now supported by the visual evi- dence of the restored figure. On first glance, the Malibu kouros presents a harmonious artistic unity that does not disintegrate with prolonged study. Individual features that seem strangely disparate when taken separately, come together to form a convincing compositional whole, an ef- fect not characteristic of a pastiche. Certain details through- out the figure emphasise an internal consistency. The curved fold of flesh over the navel is very like the fold of flesh at the root of the penis; it is also related to the way in which the upper eyelids are rendered. The rectangularity of the pectorals is echoed in both the scapulae and the but- tocks. The gentle, almost feminine face is entirely consistent with the slender proportions of the body. The linear ar- ticulation of the curls around the forehead is repeated in the graphic decorativeness of the beaded tresses and the hands. And none of these features conflicts or is uncomfort- able with any other. Perhaps the unexpected conjunction of features in the statue will ultimately be explained by the discovery of its place of origin, which is still unknown. But if we can speculate on the basis of the various regional elements that this figure combines, the Getty kouros could once have stood above a grave or in a sanctuary at a site located somewhere midway among Attica, the Peloponnesus (per- haps Corinth), and Boeotia. The dolomitic composition of the stone and the fissures etched by ground water are characteristics of Thasian marble. This marble may have been imported in a still-undocumented export trade; it may also come from a quarry which remains as yet to be identified. The Getty kouros suggests that we must revise our present concepts of strictly-defined regional styles and anatomical chronologies in light of the new evidence that it provides. Now standing erect without external support, his closed hands fixed firmly to his thighs, the kouros expresses the confident vitality that is characteristic of the best of his brothers. It is the hesitant position of the arms especially that suggests some potential for movement in the figure, a notion encouraged further by the strength of the massive thighs and calves. And though certain features of his anat- omy are rendered with almost calligraphic simplicity on the surface of the stone, the sculptor's obvious delight in the execution of the full, robust curves of the fleshy body has prevented the decorative elements from overwhelming their intended references to functional forms. God or man, he embodies all the radiant energy of the adolescence of western art. 61 Paper read at the Getty Museum by E.
