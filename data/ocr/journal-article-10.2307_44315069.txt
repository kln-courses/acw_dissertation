<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 62, No. 3 (Spring 2013) "Such Fire Is Love": The Bernardine Poetry of St. Robert Southwell, S.J. Sister Diana Marie Shaw Abstract: Though nearly forgotten for three centuries, the poetry of the Elizabethan Jesuit martyr, St. Robert Southwell, was immensely popular and influential among his contemporary cross-confessional readers. No less surprising, so too were the works of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, which the missionary-poet requested "for his solace" in the Tower. While most studies of Southwell mention this biographical fact, none examine its literary ramifications in any depth. In response, this essay explores Southwell's and Bernard's similar relations to their respective literary cultures, particularly in their religious conversion of the language of secular love. While better illuminating this central theme of both authors, this essay points to the Jesuit's contemplative medieval heritage as well as the Cistercians early modern apostolate. Jesus. Deus meus et omnia. Deus tibi se, tu te Deo. After the martyrdom of his fellow Jesuit, Robert Southwell, in February 1595, Henry Garnet was given the breviary that had accompanied his friend for two and a half years in the London Tower. Southwell had no other books in prison except for a Bible and the works of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, which his friends had sent him at his request. These books, notes the contemporary historian Diego de Yepes, "he himself wanted for his solace" (qtd. in Janelle 68). Southwell had no pen or paper, but, after the return of the breviary, Garnet discovered three aspirations repeatedly scratched on its pages: Jesus. Deus meus et omnia. Deus tibi se, tu te Deo (Janelle 68). The literary life of the talented young priest, whose writings would posthumously become bestsellers in early modern England, concluded and was encapsulated in these brief 333</page><page sequence="2">334 Christianity and Literature words. At the age of thirty-three or thirty-four, after almost nine years as a clandestine missionary, he hung on the gallows of wintry Tyburn and died. Southwell's attraction to Bernard of Clairvaux is evocative and illuminating- a window into his mind and heart during those silent years in Tyburn as well the preceding years of apostolic and literary activity. It is illuminating in large part because it is unexpected, given Southwell's Jesuit vocation and the highly mobile, vocal missionary action it entailed. The Spiritual Exercises of his Jesuit founder, Ignatius of Loyola, or the masterpiece of another early modern apostle would have been a natural choice "for his solace" in the Tower, but it was the writings of a medieval mystic that encouraged him instead. It was not to a missionary but to a monk that he turned, not to a "red martyr" of scaffold or sword but to a "white martyr," one who died in the seclusion of his cloister, having long offered himself, in the words of St. Paul, as a "living sacrifice ... [of] spiritual worship" (Rom. 12:1). Although most studies of the Jesuit poet mention the biographical fact of his reading in the Tower, none examine in any comprehensive way the theological and artistic resonances of the monk's writings within the missionary's literary corpus- his half-dozen prose treatises and meditations and about sixty poems, most of which were widely published and acclaimed during the decades after his martyrdom. In response, this essay explores the intersecting literary apostolates of Bernard and Southwell, in light of shared imagery, themes, and pastoral and devotional approaches. In particular, I will focus on their similar call to contemptus mundi through a holocaust of earthly passions and even, if necessary, life itself, along with their accompanying proposals - expressed in the converted language of human love - to embrace, and be embraced by, the One who is life and love. The fruit of this comparison is a fresh perspective on Southwell's poetic theory and practice, especially in highlighting the unity between Southwell's literature and his life, and his life and his death. Moreover, the Bernardine source points beyond itself, revealing the first source and final end of the Jesuit's work: radical adherence to the heart of the Christian faith. That is to say, it was nothing less than love poured out on a cross in Jerusalem that gave these men their identity and mission. Undeniably, the world of the Elizabethan Jesuit was far removed from that of his monastic father.1 Yet the enduring influence and appeal of Bernard, for him and for his contemporaries, shows that veins of faith and devotion did link the age of the medieval contemplative with their own- a continuity with the past that fostered Southwell's early modern success.</page><page sequence="3">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 335 Beginning with Louis Martz' Poetry of Meditation (1954), most scholars have tended to read Southwell's poetry and that of his literary successors through the lens of the meditative techniques of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises and the resulting Jesuit aesthetics.2 As an initial remedy to this neglect of medieval and specifically monastic sources, the Cistercian Gregory Schweers has pointed to Bernard s influence by noting several broad thematic and stylistic similarities between the writers, and by establishing key historical facts.3 Namely, in addition to Diego de Yepes' biographical note, there is the Jesuit's first prose piece, the Epistle of Comfort, in which the missionary quotes Bernard seventeen times - more than any other source after Augustine and the Bible (Schweers 160). These quotations prove that Southwell was attracted to Bernard from at least the beginning of his English ministry.4 Building on this foundation, this essay aims to further the study of the Jesuit's contemplative medieval heritage and the Cistercian's early modern apostolate. The Victorian Jesuit Herbert Thurston characterizes the ministry of his martyred predecessor as an "apostleship of good literature" - a phrase which holds a clue to Southwells love of Bernard, who shared a similar ministry; as Étienne Gilson puts it, the monastic reformer and his fellow Cistercians "renounced everything save the art of good writing" (Thurston 243; Gilson 63). Although we cannot ascertain which particular Bernardine texts he read in the Tower, we know he had access to an array of the Cistercian's works during his missionary years, judging from his quotations in the Epistle of Comfort. Among these are the liturgical sermons, the Sermones super Cantica Canticorum, De Diligendo Deo, De Laude Novae Militae , meditations, and various epistles ( Epistle of Comfort [£C] 251-56). The English Jesuit was not alone in his attraction to this good writing. As Southwell himself notes in the Epistle of Comfort, both Calvin and the Augsburg Confession commend this medieval father (EC 92).5 Moreover, Bernard was not only the most popular Church Father after Augustine for the Reformers, but he also held that rank among Elizabethan and Jacobean readers; his Latin texts were frequently quoted in both Anglican and Catholic theological works, and there was a lively, mainstream print market for English translations.6 This material evidence points to a deep English attraction to Bernard, spanning Reformation divides among both clergy and laity. The cross-confessional Bernardine readership of early modern England points to how broadly Southwell cast his apostolic net. In turning to Bernard he was not sequestering himself into a continental, Counter-Reformation</page><page sequence="4">336 Christianity and Literature literary niche, as some scholars would have it; he was not seeking inspiration from an alien or outmoded Catholic author, but from one who was arguably a contemporary ecumenical figure. As William Crashaw, father of the poet and convert Richard, wrote in reference to the pseudo-Bernardine Dialogues, it is "made in the Mist of Popery ... yet it is not tainted with Popish corruption, nor scarce smels of any superstition, whereas it is stuft with godly truthes and wholesome instructions," serving as a "helps to holinesse, and inticement to devotion" (qtd. in White, Prose 79). Until the past century, Southwell's occasional critics have tended similarly to excuse the executed poet as a Papist who managed to escape Popery.7 And yet, while Southwell was nearly forgotten in the narrative of literary history for some three centuries, perhaps because of lingering religious and political unease, he was remarkably popular among Elizabethan and Jacobean readers. At least twenty-two editions of his various prose works and another eighteen of his poems were published in London and abroad over the four decades following his martyrdom (Pollard and Redgrave [STC] §22946-68; Allison and Rogers §785-86). In light of this cross-confessional appeal, it is worth considering that in Bernard the missionary found a model for proclaiming deeply Catholic- and catholic- truths: truths that fed the spiritual hungers of his Papist and Protestant brethren alike.8 Bernard's works were popular devotional sources in Reformation England, so it is not surprising that they influenced the poets of the age. Richard Edwards' Paradise of Daintie Devises, which went through nine editions between 1576 and 1606, brought together a collection of "ditties both pithy and pleasant" by writers "both of honor and worship ... [who] for theyr learnying and gravitie, might be accounted of among the wisest" (STC §7516-24; Edwards, Preface). All of the poems were composed by contemporary Englishmen, with the exception of the first, announced as a "Translation of the blessed Saint Barnards [sic] verses, conteynyng the unstable felicitie of this wayfaring worlde" (Edwards 1). Although the interlinear Latin text cannot be traced surely to Bernard, the attribution is not oif the mark, for its contemptus mundi theme - pointing its readers away from "foolishe fond conceytes" and "fickle fancies toyes," and toward "hope for stedfast stay" - certainly accords with Bernard's own emphasis on the fleetingness of earthly pleasures beside God's enduring love (Edwards 1-3). Positioned at the head of this early modern anthology, sentiments of the (pseudo-)Bernardine poem echo in many of the volume's subsequent lyrics, as well as in the verse of later poets who would have been exposed to this popular collection.</page><page sequence="5">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 337 Among those poets is Southwell, who draws on the theme and language of "Translation" in such poems as "Davids Peccavi," "Mans Civili Warre," and "From Fortunes Reach" in which he vividly recounts the human struggles between reason and "fond phancy," truth and "fickle fortunes" ("Mans Civili Warre" 1.13; "From Fortunes Reach" 1.1).9 Adherence to false love, writes Southwell, presenting an anthropology like that of Bernard, gives man a "crooked mynde"; hence the soul, which of "endless bewtyes image is," can no longer serve as a "myrrhour . . . of heavenly sightes"; it is no longer illuminated by "sparkes of blisse" befitting man made in imago Dei and destined to share God's similitudo, or likeness, as well ("Sinnes Heavie Loade" 1.37; "Looke Home" 11.13, 3, 15).10 "O unspeakable blyndnesse of mans harte," he elaborates in the Epistle of Comfort, "that so easilye trayneth to senses lure, and is so soone caught with the bewtye of an Image, and hath not grace to remember whome it resembleth" (EC 35). To his countrymen Southwell thus preaches against ephemeral, sensual love, trying to draw the ever-straying human soul back to Christ, whose true beauty we ought both to reflect in our hearts and to reflect upon in our minds. In this endeavor Southwell draws on the biblically rooted tradition of describing the spiritual life as a love affair with God - a tradition nurtured by Origen, Augustine, and Gregory the Great, and a tradition which flowered in the medieval world, most notably in the writings of Bernard (Schwartz 105; McGinn 198ff). Here Gilson insists that the romantic lyrics of the twelfth century were not the secular offshoots of Bernardine piety, yet it is worth considering that the line of influence might have run in the other direction (Gilson 184). 11 That is to say, Bernard, like Southwell, looked with dismay but not despair on the popular literature of his generation, and he saw in the unrequited passions of its love lyrics a misdirected yearning to seek - and to sing about - the One who is Love. "In a century that was unique in Western history for the cultivation of love," Ewert H. Cousins remarks, "Bernard towered above his contemporaries. In the eulogies of human love, he echoed the troubadours, trouvères, and the writers of romance; but unlike his secular counterparts, he saw this love as a symbol of the souls love for Christ, and he charted a journey through love to union with God" (5). Southwell follows this same path, explicitly and repeatedly declaring his dedication to the mission of converting romance and its lovers, and quite probably drawing his literary and theological inspiration from Bernard. As he explains to fellow poets in the "Epistle" introducing his poetry, he aims</page><page sequence="6">338 Christianity and Literature to show them "to howe unworthy affections they have wedded their willes," by weaving "a newe Webb in theire owne loome . . . wherein it maye be seene how well Verse and Vertue suite together" ( Collected Poems 1). In the dedication to his long verse-lament, Saint Peters Complaynt , he adds: "Still finest wits are stilling Venus Rose. / In paynim toyes the sweetest vaines are spent: / To Christian workes, few have their talents lent" ("The Author to the Reader" 11. 16-18). lhe "Christian workes" that he has in mind are not dry disputations against worldly love but poetic expressions of the most beautiful love there is. "Passions I allow, and loves I approve" he explains in the Preface to his prose-poem Marie Magdalens Funeral Teares, "onely I would wishe that men would alter their object and better their intent" (A4). Thus, like Bernard, Southwell seeks to reorient his culture's fixation on human love toward its source and end, the love of God. While he does not find in Bernard the model of a poet per se, he does find in him a man who shares the project of fruitfully merging letters and devotion, thus converting love's language to God.12 Hence, for both Southwell and Bernard it is the desire to sing about the love of God, and to sing to the God of love, that inspires their writings. This vision of literature reflects their vision of the Christian vocation as fundamentally a call to love; as Bernard explains over the course of De Diligendo Deo, growth in the spiritual life demands continual renewal and purification of our love, as we participate ever more fully in the love of God. lhe theme pervades his writings, but nowhere more prominently than in his sermons on the divine love song, the biblical Canticle of Solomon, or Song of Songs. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, exclaims the bride, and Bernard assures, "Even one soul, if she loves God dearly, wisely, and ardently, is the Bride" (Song 1:1; Sermones super Cantica Canticorum [SCC] 73.10). Southwell, too, is confirmed in the hope that God calls us from "beautyes fading blisse," not to leave us destitute but to be enraptured by His glory: I seeke and finde a light that ever shynes Whose glorious beames display such heavenly sightes As yeld my soule the summe of all delightes. My light to love, my love to lyfe doth guide To life that lives by love and loveth lighte By love of one to whome all loves are tyd By duest debt, and never equalld right.</page><page sequence="7">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 339 Eyes light harts love soules truest life he is Consorting in three joyes one perfect blisse. ("From Fortunes Reach" 11. 13.16-24) As Bernard explains, "He makes you desire, He is what you desire. ... His love prepares and rewards ours" (De Diligendo Deo [DDD] 7.21-22). Especially in the final lyrics of Southwell's manuscripts, the language of divine love imbues his lines with mystical serenity, as the priest bids his soul to "Soare upp . . . unto thy reste," in "Seeke Flowers of Heaven," and to gather there the blossoms "whose soveraigne scent surpassing sense / So Ravisheth the Mynde" (11. 1.21-23). My beloved to me, and I to him whofeedeth among the lilies (Song 2:16). For both Southwell and Bernard, such intimate love for God is never our initiative, but always a response to His love for us. As the Jesuit describes in his laments of Mary Magdalen, the penitent soul is captivated by God's love for her, made whole by the once-recoiled arrows of His grace and made happy in the "sweet captivitye" of His heart ("Marie Magdalens complaint at Christs death" 1. 32; cf. "Mary Magdalens Blushe" 1. 13ff). She is enthralled, even wounded by love, because her Lover is pierced first; speaking to the soul Southwell avers, "God him selfe is ravisht with thy sight" ("At home in Heaven" 1. 28). This language is bold, no doubt - for an impassible Being cannot fall in love as men and women do - yet the Jesuit is here drawing on the words of the scriptural Bridegroom: Behold thou art fair, O my love ... Thou hast wounded my heart (Song 4:1,9). Out of love for fallen humanity, God suffered literal, incarnate wounding on Calvary, but these wounds of love were neither the first nor the last. Understood in a metaphoric or anthropomorphic sense - the finite mind's attempt to grasp the infinite - God was ravished by love for us from the first moment of our existence. As Bernard puts it in a sermon on the vigil of the Nativity, "She [the human soul] is the one who wounded His heart and sunk her eye of contemplation in the very abyss of God's secrets, so that she might make her dwelling in His heart and He in hers" (qtd. in McGinn 180). Such contemplation is only possible because God spreads His own robe of holiness over the soul, making her beautiful by His very act of adorning her, and desirable by His very act of desiring her. The king shall greatly desire thy beauty, sings the psalmist, and Bernard expounds: how can the "Lord who is king, who is clothed in beauty . . . [not] desire a like garment for His Bride, who is His likeness? The closer the likeness, the dearer she will be to Him" (Psalm 44[45]:12; SCC 85.10). In light of such scripture passages and Bernardine</page><page sequence="8">340 Christianity and Literature meditations, Southwell's praise of divine love is not too extravagant, nor is his wariness of profane love too harsh: "If on thy bewty God enamored be / Base be thy love of any lesse then he" ("At home in heaven" 11. 28-30). 13 The language of biblical canticles and psalms, notably echoed by Bernard, thus gives voice to Southwell's deepest yearnings and animates his most mystical poetry. As these poems attest, the Jesuit missionary- like any Christian striving ardently to know God - was a contemplative at heart, and this contemplative spirit, I believe, was nurtured by his reading of Bernard. Even as the missionary was a contemplative, the monk was a preacher. And in this apostolic dimension of Bernard's life, we find another plausible reason for Southwell's attraction to the Cistercian. As a youth, the Englishman had considered joining the Carthusians, the austere, eremitical Order of St. Bruno, but instead he discerned a call to the Society of Jesus, to become a soldier of the Lord - " militare Deo sub vexillo crucis as the Institute's founder put it (qtd. in O'Malley 45; Devlin 30-32).14 Taking up this standard, the early Jesuits were wont to declare, "We are not monks; the world is our house!" (qtd. in O'Malley 68). The English missionaries, beset by constant danger, anxiety, and activity, were no exception in their zeal, and for them the house was battered indeed. Schweers notes, however, that the gulfs between street and cloister and between Elizabethan England and medieval Christendom may not be as wide as they seem, for Bernard too lived in a "period of extreme confusion and doubt"; while there was no Tyburn in twelfth-century France, the Church and nation were wounded by heresy, schism, and political strife (159). The Cistercian spirit of contemptus mundi, however, did not blind him to these major societal needs and wounds, nor did it prompt him sweepingly to condemn the created world and its human stewards. Rather, the monk sought withdrawal from all personal desires and goals - professional, marital, even ecclesial - that could have distracted from the soul's search for God, who is man's ultimate end. With this greater freedom of mind and heart, Bernard arguably found a clearer vantage point from which to assess the tangles of the world and the one thing needful. For the Jesuit missionary and, indeed, most Christians, the search for God takes them into streets and markets, homes and churches, to care for God's children through daily interaction. And on several occasions the Cistercian abbot went forth too, to combat heresy and schism at Church councils and even to preach the Second Crusade. In this visible ministry, especially with its political ramifications, his life exceeded monastic norms</page><page sequence="9">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 341 and, no doubt, made him a more fitting model and patron for a missionary like Southwell. Yet, Bernard's most profound and enduring influence on later Christians, Southwell among them, comes in the shared fruits of his contemplative life, namely, his insights born in prayer and communicated in sermons and meditations. Far from a hidden light, his life in the monastery of Clairvaux - literally translated "bright valley" - was thus one of brilliantly apostolic contemplation. Despite this intersection of the monastic and missionary charisms, Bernard's and Southwell's vocations cannot be collapsed together, as becomes clear in their expositions of the mystical union. Both authors write of the bliss, even ecstasy, experienced in the Bridegroom's embrace. But, even while Southwell read and loved Bernard and explicitly proposed to convert hearts by converting the language of profane love, such sublime moments come rarely in his own writings. In part, this reticence about divine intimacy can be explained by his practical Jesuit charism and his lay Elizabethan audience. Even though Bernard frequently urges his monastic audience to repentance and humbly speaks about his own soul as "burdened with sins . . . [and] almost totally unacquainted . . . with the joys of the supernatural life," he can still assume that most of his listeners are already on the path toward conversion of life, with some approaching its higher stages; thus, he has greater freedom to meditate, in prayer and in preaching, on the beauty of divine love. In contrast, those to whom Southwell speaks are lay men and women, too often tempted to stray from their divine Lover amid spiritual and political strife. Hence, with an eye to recusant Catholic readers as well as to Protestants and conformist Catholics (those conforming outwardly but reluctantly), Southwell repeatedly depicts the anguish of betrayal. In his dramatic monologue, Saint Peters Complaynt, for example, he gives words to Peter, the denying Apostle: "No love more lov'd then mine of him I serv'd, / Large use he gave, a flame for every sparke. / This love I lost, this losse a life must rue" (11. 501-03). The first pope thus becomes a model for Elizabethan readers besieged from without and within - a model not of ecstasy but of contrition. This was fitting, for, conformist or not, every Christian reader suffers the pangs of dwelling in a "vale of teares" - a phrase Southwell borrows from the antiphon Salve Regina, popularly attributed to Bernard in his day - for every Christian is weighed down by sin and suffering, knowing the "sorrowes of [a] troubled mynde" ("At Home in Heaven" 1. 20; "A Vale of Teares" 1. 55).15 As the Jesuit declares in the Epistle of Comfort, addressed to Catholics awaiting execution but also directed to all members of Jesus'</page><page sequence="10">342 Christianity and Literature wounded body, "We must not now seeke Christ as our Ladye did inter cognatos &amp; notos , amongest her kinsefolke and acquaintance (Lk. 2:44), nor as the spouse did, that sayed, In lectulo meo per noctes, quaesivi quem diligit anima mea : In my bed have I in the nights, sought whom my hart best loved (Song 3:1)" (EC 31). Rather, the author insists, we shall find Him like Moses and "our aunciente fathers ... in the deserte, amiddest the fyer and thornes (Ex. 3:2)" (EC 32). We find Him in our misery, since He joins our wounds to His. Southwell's theology of the Cross is ultimately rooted in Scripture- in the Gospels themselves and in their unsurpassed exposition in the written and lived witness of Paul. Yet here again Southwell would have found his apostolic and, indeed, contemplative bent resonating with Bernard's own, for the monk also drew extensively on that preeminent preacher- a great apostle because he was first, in the words of the Cistercian, "the greatest of contemplatives" (SCC 57.8). In a Pauline vein De Diligendo Deo attests, "The faithful soul ... must glory in the degradation of the Cross until it is capable of contemplating the glory of God's revealed face" (4.12; cf. Gal. 6:14). Southwell knows this truth well, and thus, when he "weave[s] a new webbe" on the loom of Elizabethan love poetry, it is only rarely to replace profane love with blissful contemplation. Instead, he converts the passion of Cupid to the Passion of the Cross - showing that a wounded body makes visible a ravished heart; that the fire of pain is the fire of love. In this, he is not just following Bernard's counsel but also his example, for, repeatedly and piercingly, even amid his most mystical reflections on the Canticle, the Mellifluous Doctor keeps turning to the amor carnalis Christi , the love of Christ incarnate and Christ crucified. As Bernard, echoing Paul, declares in his sermons on the Canticle, thoughts about the Passion are "often on my lips, and God knows they are always in my heart. . . . This is my philosophy, one more refined and interior, to know Jesus and Him crucified" (43.4). This was Southwell's philosophy and theology too, and it was one he cultivated in prayer and poetry, in Ufe and death. As Helen C. White observes, "The soul's seeking its true home in heaven ... is not [the Jesuit's] highest flight. The thought that infinite Love should yet seek the love of its creature has awed some of the profoundest of Christian minds" ("Southwell" 9). Bernard, we have seen all too briefly, is among these Christians; so too is Southwell. As the Englishman marveled in "At Home in Heaven," addressing the soul in exile, "Thy ghostly beauty offred force to God, / It cheynd him in the linckes of tender love. / It woon his will with man to make aboade"; in this way our</page><page sequence="11">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 343 God suffered Himself to enter our "vale of teares," becoming one with us (11.7-9, 20). In "The Burning Babe," Southwell's most frequently read poem, we encounter this mystery in terms that are at once simple and shocking. The speaker is walking on a "hoary Winters night"- Christmas night, we learn by the end - when suddenly "a pretty babe all burninge bright" enflâmes the air above him and begins to speak: Alas quoth he but newly borne in fiery heates I frye Yet none approach to warme their hartes or feele my fire but I My faultless brest the furnace is the fuell woundinge thornes Love is the fire and sighs the smoke the ashes shame and scornes The fewell Justice layeth on and Mercy blowes the coales The metal in this furnace wrought are mens defiled soules For which as nowe on fire I am to worke them to their good So will I melt into a bath to washe them in my bloode. (11. 1,4,7-14) This poem, in ballad-like poulter's measure, prompted the great Ben Jonson to declare that though "Southwell was hanged, yet so he had written that piece of his, 'The Burning Babe,' he would have been content to destroy many of his" (qtd. in Pilarz xxi). Whatever Jonson's motivations for this comment (sincere or satirical), it nonetheless suggests that he saw Southwell as a redoubtable poet, worthy of engagement. Although many subsequent readers have been perplexed by the poem's strange conceit, often to the point of dismissing the lyric as a trifle of Baroque continentalism, I believe Devlin has it right when he observes that "it was not the phrasing of Southwell's poem that struck his fellow poets, but its blindingly simple conception of the Son of God appearing through the veils of earthly qualities and earthly feelings" (267). In this depiction of the spiritual life as a vivid, personal encounter with Love made flesh - startling to the reader and night wanderer alike - the Jesuit draws on the insights of the spiritual exercises that flourished during the sixteenth century, most prominently those of Ignatius of Loyola and Lorenzo Scupoli. According to Martz, their devotional methods, in turn, have roots in Bernardine meditation, with its emphasis on experience and self-examination (118-25). "I am telling you of what comes within my own experience," says Bernard in his sermons on the Canticle, and he encourages his readers to look into their own book of life and find his words resonating therein (51.3; 3.1). No doubt Southwell never saw a flaming child, and neither did his readers. But the shocking</page><page sequence="12">344 Christianity and Literature realization that the babe of Christmas is God, come as a holocaust of love for each soul- that is no matter for mere theological abstraction or pious platitudes, but a reality to be experienced, to burn and melt the heart. Southwells Christmas poem is Bernardine not only in its underlying theology and psychology, but also in its very imagery. "Love is the fire," says Southwell's Christ-child, and as Love Incarnate, He makes this blaze visible. This equation of love and fire pervades the Judeo-Christian literary tradition, but it takes a striking form in Bernard's writings. As the Cistercian explains in Sermon 57 on the Canticle, God does not just kindle the fire of love: He is that very fire. "The fire that is God does indeed devour but it does not debase," Bernard writes; "it burns pleasantly, devastates felicitously. It is a coal of desolating fire, but a fire that rages against vices only to produce a healing unction in the soul" (57.7). Transformed and set aglow by this flame, he adds, we will at last be able to declare with David, "My heart became hot within me, as I mused the fire burned" (qtg. Ps. 38[39]:4). This is the experience that Bernard, like Southwell, wishes for his readers: an experience of God's love setting their own souls aflame. God makes His love manifest in the Incarnation, but most of us are blind to that fire consuming the divine infant. And thus, He does not just take on a human body but lays down that body, literally washing the world in His blood as the burning babe promised. "Sweete olive, / that powres, / unstamped, / fayre oyle" writes Southwell in his meditation on "Christs Bloody Sweate," creating in his very lines an image of the outpouring of divine life and love (11. 1-4). Such biblical imagery was also dear to Bernard, and his reflections complement and illuminate the missionary's lyrics: "They pierced His hands and His feet, they gorged His side with a lance, and through these fissures I can suck honey from the rock and oil from the flinty stone - I can taste and see that the Lord is good. . . . The secret of His heart is laid open through the clefts of His body; that mighty mystery of loving is laid open, laid open, too, the tender mercies of our God" ( SCC 60.8). The wounds are gory, but that is not what the eye of the soul ultimately sees, for Christ's blood makes known His love. As Southwell goes on to ponder: "Such fire is love that fedd with gory bloode / Doth burne the lesse then in the driest woode" ("Sweate" 11. 16-17). Like the burning babe, the crucified Christ is a holocaust of love. For both Bernard and Southwell, the believer is called to partake of this holocaust not only as a pious observer, nor simply as a witness in words, but also as one who drinks Jesus' very chalice of love. "So urgent is the charity</page><page sequence="13">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 345 of those through whom the streams of heavenly doctrine flow to us," writes Bernard in Sermon 18, "that they want to pour it forth before they have been filled" (18.3). Here he refers directly to priests and preachers, but also by extension to all called to the fellowship of faith, reminding his listeners that they cannot share Christs love with others without first sharing His love with Him, and that includes drinking from the clefts of His wounds. In more Southwellian terms, Jesus blood shed in the garden and on the mount is the visible flame of His love and oil of His mercy, enkindling and feeding our hearts and so uniting us to Him. Thus, Southwell concludes his meditation on the Passion by asking to be taken onto the pyre of the holocaust: 0 sacred Fire come shewe thy force on me That sacrifice to Christe I maye retorne If withered wood for fuell fittest bee If stones and dust yf fieshe and blood will burne 1 withered am and stonye to all good. A sacke of dust a masse of fieshe and bloode. ("Sweate" 11. 19-24) The Eucharistie resonance of the final line, similar to the communion of Christs blood that Bernard sees in the Canticle, underscores both the perpetuation of the sacrifice of Calvary and our literal participation in that offering through the food and drink of His sacraments. But the stanza as a whole also reminds us of an offering that can be made with every breath: the offering of love. This was an offering that Southwell would make radically, visibly, painfully on the gallows of Tyburn - a sacrifice which he, like Christ in Gethsemane, now anticipates and accepts: Fiat voluntas tua . In the Jesuits focus on returning Christs sacrifice, we find another plausible reason for his attraction to Bernard. For Bernard writes of martyrdom repeatedly - over one hundred twenty times in his collected works. He sometimes does so with militant language, as in De Laude Novae Militae - "Rejoice, brave athlete, if you live and conquer in the Lord; but glory and exult even more if you die and join your Lord!" - in which he exhorts the Knights Templar to pious heroism, while also calling all faithful to wage the spiritual battle of heroic piety (1). More often, though, Bernard speaks of martyrdom with gentler but sustaining encouragement. My dove in the clefts of the rock ... show me thy face, pleads the bride of the Canticle, and the monk ponders how the Lord is the rock and the clefts, His wounds:</page><page sequence="14">346 Christianity and Literature He who looks upon those wounds can think no longer of his own. The martyr stands; he stamps the ground in triumph, though his body is all torn. When the knife rips open his side, blithely as well as bravely he sees the blood well forth. ... It is no drug, but love that causes this. The senses are not lost, but lifted up. The pain is present, but it is subdued, it is despised. From the Rock, therefore, is the martyr's strength, strong as the rock to endure, and valiant to drink as the chalice of his Lord. And that inebriating chalice, how glorious it is! (Song 2:14; SCC 61. 8)16 Abiding with the dove in the clefts and meditating constantly on Christ's wounds brings the "endurance for martyrdom," the monk assures; "Where then is the soul of the martyr? In a safe place, of course; in the rocks, of course; in the heart of Jesus, of course, in wounds open for it to enter" (61.7). In words that echo Bernard's, Southwell reproaches his fellow countrymen, for whom martyrdom was a fearsome social reality: "His side [is] open to geve us entrance . . . [yet we] have contemned all his invitings" (EC 19). And he does not just reproach with words; he also bears witness with actions. In poems such as "Christs Bloody Sweate," ratified in his life and death, the missionary knocks and enters in. Bernard was not a martyr in the sense that Southwell was, and yet, I would suggest, both he and Southwell knew that the sharing of Christ's sacrifice is accomplished in spirit as well as body. Though only the latter man was killed for his faith, each offered himself for that faith in his daily embrace of the Lord's call. "Certainly it is a kind of martyrdom to put to death the deeds of the body by the power of the Spirit," writes Bernard in Sermon 30 on the pruning of the vine, adding in his Sententiae that "Martyrdom without blood is threefold: sparingness in prosperity . . . liberality in poverty . . . chastity in youth" (SCC 30.1 1; Sententiae 2.148). Southwell too made this offering of love, long before he mounted the gallows. "My aim in entering religion," he explains in his youthful Spiritual Exercises , "was that, by constant mortification of self and by submitting myself to all men for Christ's sake, I might become as like to my crucified Saviour as I could, and use every endeavour to attain to his love. ... I refuse nothing, I will embrace all, I will endure all, not indeed I, dust and ashes as I am, but thou, my Lord, in me" (33-34, 104). On setting off for England, Southwell was burning with the martyr's zeal, but he soon realized the full import of surrendering himself to God: to seek not death but the divine will, ministering to his English brethren for as long as the Lord ordained: "If . . . Thou seest that for me to abide still in the flesh is needful for others, Thy will be done" ( Exercises 104-</page><page sequence="15">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 347 05; Devlin 130). Thus he, like Bernard, embraced a martyrdom of the spirit so that, when he was finally led to Tyburn, his bloodshed was nothing more nor less than a visible manifestation and earthly conclusion of the sacrifice he had long lived.17 In this way, Bernard may have provided him not simply with solace on the brink of death, but also with strength during life - an example of life lived fully for God. Deus tibi se , tu te Deo . This line, scratched in Southwells breviary in the Tower, sums up the theme of his life, the theme of his poetry. A prison servant reported that he would cry out these words in the midst of torture, and Garnet added that "he was wont to write [them] often on all his belongings" (qtd. in Janelle 69). Like Christ on Calvary, Southwell made his self-gift vivid to the earthly eye on the day of his martyrdom; but, like Christ in Bethlehem, this offering had long been burning in his heart. Such sacrifice is only possible, as Southwell ponders in "Christs Bloody Sweate," because God gives us His life, enflâmes us with His love - a love manifest in the Crucifixion, in the Incarnation, in the very fact of our Creation. Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister ; my bride (Song 4:9). Some of Southwells richest lines of poetry - and also his most explicitly Bernardine - savor this truth: Gift better then himself God doth not knowe Gift better then his God no man can see This gift doth here the giver given bestowe Gift to this gift lett ech receiver bee God is my gift, himself he freely gave me Gods gift am I and none but God shall have me. ("Nativity" 11. 13-18) So he declares in his "Nativity of Christe," a meditation on the triple mystery of Creation, Incarnation, and Redemption and an elaboration of his motto, Deus tibi se. While the image of exchanged gifts is expressed by numerous saints, and while Southwells motto cannot be traced verbatim to Bernard or anyone else, I see a central passage from De Diligendo Deo underlying this recurrent theme - reinforced by Southwells quotation of these very lines in the Epistle of Comfort.18 Rather than cling to imperfect love, a "vain shadow of Gods sovereign beauty and majesty," the missionary counsels in his chapter on imitatio Christi , we ought much more "to be deepely ravished with the love of God, and so settle our myndes therin, that we thincke it our chiefest happynesse in this lyfe, to embrace all hazardes, disgraces, &amp; misfortunes in his quarell, and then to have moste cause of comforte, when</page><page sequence="16">348 Christianity and Literature for his glory, we are in moste bitter panges" (EC 37). As he elaborates in the next paragraph, turning to the Cistercian father, our offering is minute beside the Lord's immense gift: S. Bernard sayeth: Si totum me debeopro me facto, quid addam iam pro me refecto. Nec enim tam facile refectus, quam factus. In primo opere, me mihi dedit, in secundo se, &amp; ubi se dedit, me mihi reddidit. Datus ergo &amp; redditus, me pro me debeo, &amp; bis debeo. Sed quid domino pro se retribuam. Nam et [iam] si me millies rependere posse[m], quid sum ad dominu[m] meum. If I owe my seife wholye for my firste makinge, what can I add more for my redeeminge, espeaciallye seinge I was not so easely redeemed, as I was made. In the first worke he gaue me my selfe, in the second him selfe, and when he gaue me him selfe, he restored vnto me my selfe. Therefore thus geuen &amp; restored, I owe my selfe for my selfe, and I owe my selfe twise. But now what am I able to repaye my Lorde for him selfe. For though I coulde repaye my selfe a thousande tymes, what am I in comparison of my Lorde. O harde and stonye harte, that is not incensed, at the consideration of so inflamed love, and beinge woed of so lovinge a spouse, can rejecte this offer, or be slacke in recognisinge so unspeakable charitye. (EC 37-38, qtg. DDD 5.15)" Deus tibi se, tu te Deo. God gives us ourselves in Creation, yet we deform that gift in false love; thus, that we may be restored, He offers us the gift of Himself, He asks nothing in return but a heart inflamed with His. One who gives himself to God gives himself also to Gods people, unbounded by the walls of cloister, nation, century, or religious confession. Bernard of Clairvaux was such a prophetic figure, and his apostolate of letters brought solace to a Jesuit on the brink of death and, no less important, inspired his mission during life. From his twelfth-century cloister Bernard reminded the Elizabethan priest and those to whom he ministered - Catholic and Protestant, through preaching and through poetry, during life and after death- that, in the midst of persecution, confusion, and division, God's love endures and one thing is needful: Tu te Deo. Quoted repeatedly in the Jesuit's epistle on martyrdom, echoed in his pastoral poetry and life maxim, and cherished in his Tower cell, the Cisterican monk thus becomes an apostle of early modern England. And, crucially, he fulfills this role as a contemplative, showing the missionary and his anguished countrymen that the offering of the heart precedes that of the body, and that God's gift precedes ours. Amor ipse intellectus est : This phrase, adapted from Gregory and</page><page sequence="17">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 349 Bernard, became a motto of medieval Cistercian spirituality, and in his life and writing Southwell echoes the theme.20 "I love because I love. I love that I may love," says the monk, and the missionary replies, "Love is not ruled with reason but with love" (SCC 83.4; Marie Magdalens Funeral Teares 52- 53). In the eyes of the world, neither mans life makes sense: It overturns social expectations to enter a cloister, dying so radically to earthly loves and pursuits, for someone with the apostolic talents of Bernard; it defies human prudence to join the Society of Jesus and follow a path of almost sure martyrdom, for a contemplative poet like Southwell. It resists human logic that these men would sacrifice the passion of human love for the Passion of the Cross, offering themselves as a holocaust for God. More incredibly, it resists human logic that God would offer Himself as a holocaust for us. But surpassing the limits of our reason is the logic of divine love, whose language is not one of propositions and proofs but of song and poetry. Dilectus meus mihi et ego ilĶ declares the bride of the Canticle (2:16), and in life and in letters Robert Southwell, like Bernard of Clairvaux before him, takes up her song. University of Notre Dame Monastery of Our Lady of the Rosary NOTES lrIhe rent between the world of the Reformation and that of medieval Christen- dom literally surrounded the young Southwell, for his family estate included one of Englands dissolved abbeys, bequeathed to his conformist grandfather under King Henry VIII (Devlin 3). 2St. Robert Bellarmine, under whom Southwell studied in Rome, offers a soar- ing articulation of what might be called "Jesuit humanism" in his Minds Ascent to God by the Ladder of Created Things : "How great is human genius, which has invented skills such that we wonder whether nature surpasses art or art surpasses nature. . . . The human possesses . . . the gift of inventing things [because] the hu- man soul is endowed with reason and judgment and invents countless skills. ... If you admire human genius, you should admire God more" (qtd. in Pilarz 168-69). 3Although Schweers does not mention it, Martz does, in fact, acknowledge the influence of Bernard on the devotional culture of the Reformation, and particu- larly on the Spiritual Exercises. In his discussions of early modern meditation, he notes the influence of Bernard's anthropological understanding of man as created in Gods image and called to restore His lost likeness (notably expounded on in the Sermones super Cantica Canticorum ); his focus on self-examination (seen in</page><page sequence="18">350 Christianity and Literature such works as De Gradibus Superbiae ); his wariness of curiositas and the resulting Bonaventurian emphasis on devotion of the heart over perception of the mind; and the centrality of the life of Christ in his meditations. However, even as Martz points to this influence of Bernard on early modern devotional trends, and on the poets Henry Vaughan and John Donne in particular, he is silent about the influence of Bernard on Southwell. 4Schweers does not delve into particular Bernardine sources in the Epistle of Comfort, and he glances at only two of the Jesuiťs poems in passing ("Davids Pec- cavi" and "Vale of Tears"). Instead, he focuses on several broad Bernardine themes in Southwell s life and work, including their similar calls to renew their suffering Church (albeit from different religious and social positions), a common mode of integrating literary form with devotional matter, a shared "biblical style" in which scriptural language and imagery densely lace their speech, a similar fascination with the spiritual and psychological course of the soul's conversion, and a deep love of the Virgin Mary (Schweers 159-66). Schweers thus provides a fine but hitherto untried basis for further study. Additional but much slimmer resources include a brief discussion of Bernard s influence on later metaphysical poets (unfortunately bypassing Southwell) in Regina Mara Schwartz' Sacramental Poetics; a textual note in the 1967 McDonald/Brown edition of Southwells poetry, citing a single Bernar- dine echo; speculations by Christopher Devlin about Southwell's reading of Ber- nard in the Tower; and the publication history of Bernardine texts, with Helen C. Whites scholarship on his early modern reception. 5Luther even goes so far as to declare: "I love Bernard as the one among all writers who preached Christ most charmingly. I follow him wherever he preached Christ, and I pray to Christ in the faith in which he prayed to Christ" (qtd. in Pos- set 37). Seventeen English editions of seven different Bernardine and pseudo-Ber- nardine compilations, translated from the original Latin, were published between 1496 and 1640; in addition, the continuing popularity and circulation of Bernar- dine manuscripts and foreign editions is indicated by the frequency with which he is quoted in Latin in both Anglican and recusant Catholic theological texts (White, Prose 78; Pollard and Redgrave [STC] §1908-23). 7For an example of begrudging praise, see Alexander Grosart's Introduction to the 1872 edition of Southwell's poetry: "I should blush for my protestantism if I did not hold in honor, yea reverence, his stainless and beautiful memory, all the more that he was on the losing side" (lxvi). In addition to Grosart's edition of the poetry, printed for private circulation, three other editions of the poetry appeared in the nineteenth century, but none of these achieved a large readership, especially outside of Catholic circles. No editions were published from the English Civil War until this time, and not until the work of Martz, Brown, and James McDonald in the mid-twentieth century did Southwell begin achieving wider scholarly recogni- tion. In the past quarter-century, Southwell's role in literary history has been far-</page><page sequence="19">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 351 ther solidified with revised scholarly understandings of the English Reformation, countering a Whig narrative of the rapid and inevitable rise of Protestantism and emphasizing greater fluidity and even ambiguity among medieval, Reformation, and Counter- Reformation religious cultures in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. J. J. Scarisbrick's Reformation of the English People (1984), Christopher Haighs Eng- lish Reformation Revised (1987), and Eamons Duffy's Stripping of the Altars (1992) were landmark studies in this regard, supplemented and nuanced by subsequent scholarship; devoting particular and recent attention to Southwell are Allison Shell, Scott R. Pilarz, and Anne Sweeney. 8For speculation on Southwells ecumenical intentions, though without men- tion of Bernard, see Nancy Pollard Browns "Robert Southwell: The Mission of the Written Word," 274. 9Here and throughout, quotations of Southwells poetry are taken from the Da- vidson/Sweeney edition. 10For a discussion of Bernards theological anthropology, drawn particularly from De Gratia et Libera Arbitrio and the Sermones super Cantica Canticorum) see McGinn 168-74. HGilson takes on the question of the troubadours' influence on Bernard in an appendix: "St. Bernard and Courtly Love." Here he sharply declares: "It seems quite clear in any event that the two systems are mutually exclusive, and that any com- munication between them is conceivable only with difficulty. There cannot be fili- ation between the two conceptions of love in which the very name of love bears contradictory meanings. There is no passage from Cistercian love to courtly love save by apostasy, nor from courtly love to Cistercian love save by abjuration" (184). 12In Bernard's writings, according to Jean Leclercq, "plays on word, and sounds, alliterations, inflexions, rhymes, and verses contribute to the rhythm of every phrase and page" (27). Citing this passage, Schweers adds, "Indeed, Bernard's Latin style has some of those lush, stylistic qualities which one might call a kind of me- dieval euphemism, a style with which the Elizabethan Southwell would feel very much at ease" (164). 13In a similar vein the Cistercian warns that the blessed soul "cannot be en- slaved by gluttony and sensual pleasures, by the lust of the eyes, the ambition to rule, or by worldly pride in the possession of power. If she is to become heaven, the dwelling-place of God, it is first of all essential that she be empty of all these defects" (SCC 27:10). 14Southwells vocation as a soldier of God must be understood in a spiritual sense. As Ignatius of Loyola explained, Jesuits were "soldiers" commissioned "to serve the Lord alone and the Church, his spouse, under the Roman pontiff, the vicar of Christ on earth," in an Institute founded "to strive especially for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine . . . the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity and the spiritual consolation of Christs faithful through hearing confessions and administering the</page><page sequence="20">352 Christianity and Literature other sacraments"; moreover, the Ignatian Formula goes on to say, the Institutes member "should show himself ready to reconcile the estranged, compassionately to assist and serve those who are in prisons or hospitals and, indeed, to perform any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good." Countering the tendency to see the Jesuit mission as setting Church and state in fiery opposition (a view prevalent among Elizabethan Protestants and still lingering in recent scholarship), Pilarz notes that Southwell loved both God and England, and he was passionately and sincerely devoted to their reconciliation. In his mild and ecumenical manner and his passionate but respectful plea for toleration ( Humble Supplication to her Majesty, 1591), he distanced himself from the more pugnacious Edmund Campion and that Jesuit's defiant "Challenge to the Privy Council" (1580). Pilarz arguably overstates Southwell's conciliatory spirit, however, for Southwell only wanted reconciliation in the truth, in which he had unwavering conviction; as Garnet wrote in a letter to the Society's master general the day after Southwell's martyrdom, his companion was "an unvanquished soldier of Christ" (qtd. in Sweeney 262). 15Scholars now trace the Marian antiphon Salve Regina most probably to an eleventh-century Benedictine, Herman the Lame, though formerly it was often at- tributed to Bernard, due to the Cistercian's deep devotion to the Virgin Mary and his Order 's custom of daily chanting the Salve . 16I follow Devlin's more lyrical translation here, quoted in his extended specu- lation about Southwell's Bernardine meditations while in the Tower (293). All other quotations from SCC follow the Walsh/Edmonds editions. 17Quoting St. Paul, Southwell declared in Latin on the scaffold: "If we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord. Whether we live or whether we die we are the Lord's" (Rom. 14:8). These words, copied in his Spiritual Exercises , had long guided his life (Caraman 1 10). 18For a similar expression of our exchange of gifts with God, see Teresa of Avi- las Life, 27.13: "Consider, and it is true, that God gives Himself to those who give up everything for Him." To be precise, however, Teresa's giving up of everything does not necessarily imply giving back her very life, as Southwell and Bernard expressly put it. 19In the textual notes to their edition, Brown and McDonald cite this Bernar- dine passage ( DDD 5. 1 5) as a potential source for "The Nativity of Christe," but they do not note the resonance with Southwell's dictum, nor his quotation of these lines in EC. Aside from his title phrase "Vale of Teares," noted by Schweers, this is the only specific Bernardine (or pseudo-Bernardine) passage I have seen any scholar link to one of Southwell's poems. 20The precise Gregorian and Bernardine phrase is Amor ipse notitia est See McGinn 202 on the genesis of the more familiar motto, Amor ipse intellectus est.</page><page sequence="21">The Poetry of St. Robert Southwell 353 WORKS CITED Allison, A.
