<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELEMENTS IN THE CITY PLAN OF JERUSALEM DURING THE MONARCHY Yigal Shiloh During the last four years we have been uncovering the remains of the City of David, from the Chalcolithic Age, in the fourth millennium B.C., to the Middle Ages. These discoveries have aroused considerable interest in this country and throughout the world. A number of central problems have been solved by these excavations, and additional, new scientific questions have arisen. The answers to these questions are being sought by the City of David staff both during summer seasons of excavation and during the course of the year in the laboratories of the Hebrew University. The Subject: Elements in the City Plan The plan of Jerusalem during the Monarchy has been chosen because it is that particular area of investigation that presented a number of challenges to the City of David Society within the scope of its own plan of research. I believe that today we have a sufficient amount of new data to significantly illuminate several of the components which comprise the complex mosaic of this city. This lecture will focus particularly on the important discoveries made in Area G, where, for the first time, one may point to monumental remains from the tenth-ninth centuries B.C., when Jerusalem reached its apogee. The City of David Society for the Excavation, Preservation and Restoration of the City of David, Jerusalem was founded in 1978 by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, the Israel Exploration Society, the Jerusalem Foundation, a group of sponsors from South Africa headed by Mr. Mendel Kaplan and the Ambassador Cultural International Foundation in the U.S.A. Important assistance has been given to us by the Rothschild Fund and by the Jerusalem municipality. The senior staff, which has shouldered this project since its inception, includes architect Giora Solar and archaeologists Alon De Groot (Area E,), David Tarier (Area G), Donald Zvi Ariel (Area D), Yair Shoham (Area E2), Jane Cahill and Tamar Shiloh. Many other scholars working in interrelated fields are engaged in preparing several other categories of archaeological finds for publication and I beg their pardon for not mentioning them individually for lack of time. 139</page><page sequence="2">140 YIGAL SHILOH Scholars engaged in the topographical-archaeological research of ancient Jerusalem have been in mutual agreement for many years that the site of the Canaanite and Israelite city, which we call the "City of David," was situated on the southeastern hill of Jerusalem, and stretched along the Kidron Valley, south of the Temple Mount. In planning the excavations in the City of David we were faced with several dictates. We could excavate in only two areas of state land situated on the eastern slope of the hill. Here we began excavating seven sub-areas. In Area A, in the south, at the mouth of the central valley, we have studied a network of dams and fortifications associated with ancient water systems. In Areas B and D we obtained a profile of the slope by cutting a section adjacent to Weill's excavations; these areas will aid in clarifying a number of questions related to the Shiloah tunnel/channel from the First Temple period, and a number of walls from the Persian and Hellenistic age. In Area E! we are uncovering the line of the city's fortifications from the Middle Bronze Age II to the end of the Iron Age II, as well as a residential quarter, rich in finds, from the time of Hezekiah until the destruction of the First Temple. The continuation of this fortification system is being exposed in Area E2 and investigations are being made into the nature of the extramural bedrock surface. Natural pits in the bedrock have produced ceramic evidence for the earliest settlement of the slope, dating to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze I periods. Area E3, which was opened last season, has revealed a system of terrace walls dating from the Hellenistic and Roman periods and we are presently beginning to penetrate the Israelite stratum there. In Area G we have continued excavations begun by Macalister and Duncan and Kenyon and have excavated the remains of Hasmonean and early Roman fortifications, an interesting level from the Persian period, domestic structures and architectural elements dating from the tenth century B.C. to the destruction of the First Temple period and impressive remains of the Canaanite-Jebusite city from the Late Bronze Age II. Investigations in Area J have centered on the components of Jerusalem's underground water supply system, including Warren's Shaft and the initial part of the Shiloah tunnel/channel. Two seasons of diligent excavation were necessary in order to penetrate the many meters of layered dumps covering the tops of Iron Age wall remains in Area E. The massive fortification line of the Israelite city was found to be situated at mid-slope on the bedrock. Attached to and</page><page sequence="3">THE CITY PLAN OF JERUSALEM 141 supported above it is a well-planned system of structurally integrated terraces which served as podia for domestic structures built atop them. The combination of the contemporary Arab village of Silwan, set on the opposite slope of the Kidron, and the suggested isometric reconstruction by our architect, Giora Solar, may serve as the closest approximation of this residential quarter, constructed in the late eighth century B.C., perhaps during the reign of Hezekiah, and destroyed by the Babylonians. One of the most impressive finds from the first season was the monumental inscription which was not found in situ, but was recovered from dumps outside the city wall. This inscription, mentioning the heaping up or accumulation (צבר in Hebrew) of property or of stores of food, belongs to an important public building from the late eighth century B.C. Since the second season we have been searching for just such a building in that area. Therefore, we were not surprised when, on the upper terrace, there appeared the collapse of a structure of large dimensions built of rough ashlar stones of impressive size. This season we are working with all diligence to uncover the building. In tandem, another phenomenon has been clarified this season. The line of the Israelite city wall in this area from the Iron Age II was integrated with and built along the same line as the Middle Bronze Age II wall. Segments of cyclopian stones belonging to that latter wall were discerned in the northern section, where contemporary architectural elements were found to be clearly related to it stratigraphically from the inside. From these lower areas, let us turn to the area closest to the crest of the slope, the acropolis, the upper city of the First Temple period: our Area G. In this area and its vicinty many scholars have worked for the last century, including Macalister and Duncan in 1923-25, Crowfoot and Fitzgerald in 1925-27, and Kenyon in 1961-67. Kenyon's large-scale excavations were actually the major steppingstone in the investigation of Iron Age Jerusalem. On the basis of her series of contiguous squares excavated down to bedrock along the entire eastern slope, from the crest to just above the Gihon Spring, archaeologists could, for the first time, gain an initial idea regarding the structure of the Israelite city. Her proving that the square tower, until then thought to be a component part of the Israelite city fortifications, was actually built atop destruction layers from the end of the First Temple period, was a major contribution to archaeological research. Kenyon identified the tower and the stone, stepped structure to its north as elements of the Hasmonean and Herodian city defenses. This attribution</page><page sequence="4">142 YIGAL SHILOH was unanimously accepted until the third season of our excavations. In 1978 excavations were begun in this area, Area G. The important discoveries related to finds from the Persian and the Hasmonean periods lie outside the scope of this lecture. Beneath these levels we excavated a terrace of Israelite buildings covered by an awesome destruction layer dating to 586 B.C. It was a laborious task to remove the stone collapse of buildings, parts of which remained standing to a height of three meters, in order to obtain an impressive picture of the exceptionally well-built residential units in this area. The central structure was built on the Four Room House plan, well known in other Israelite cities. It was rich in architectural detail and contained a wealth of small finds including: pottery vessels, stone weights incised with various appropriate values, metal tools, figurines, ostraca on which appears the theophoric name ,Ahi'el, meaning "the brother of God," or "God is my brother" (similar to Hi'el, or 'Ahiram — Hiram), an ashlar stone architectural element with an incised paleo Hebrew inscription, personal names incised on local ceramic ware and written in South Arabian script. These shards are incised in a technique peculiar to the area of Judah (treated elsewhere by Avigad and Prignaud). Connections between South Arabia and Jerusalem in the seventh century B.C. wUl doubtless become an important subject for further research. However, the greatest surprise awaited us beneath the floor of the Four Room House, which existed in the area during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. When the first stepped, stone courses appeared beneath the floor of this house, no connection was made between them and the well known structure in the upper terrace. But with the extension of the excavation northward and the removal of the massive stone collapse, it became unequivocally clear that the stone, stepped structure presently unearthed to a height of 15 meters (or five-storeys) lies stratigraphically beneath the seventh-sixth century B.C. terrace of buildings. Thus, contrary to Kenyon, we must conclude that the date of the stepped, stone structure must predate those centuries. Probes were made beath the stone, stepped structure in order to determine the general stratigraphic situation. On the lower and upper terraces were revealed impressive remains preserved to a height of 5 meters, comprising massive boulder and earth-filled terraces from the Late Bronze Age II, i.e. the fourteenth-thirteenth centuries B.C. The stratigraphical "sandwich" therefore has been defined absolutely: the</page><page sequence="5">THE CITY PLAN OF JERUSALEM 143 stone, stepped structure was built here between the twelfth century B.C. — atop Canaanite terraces, and the eighth century B.C. — beneath Israelite dwellings. In initial, narrow probes carried out astride the stone, stepped structure, we have apparently succeeded in defining a tenth-ninth century B.C. level, probably related to this structure. One of the finds from this level was a fragment of a bearded and naked anthropomorphic relief apparently belonging to a ceramic cultic stand of a type found in the tenth century B.C. strata at Megiddo and Taanach. An interpretation of the scene portrayed in this relief would in itself be worthy of a separate lecture. We have come to the tentative assumption that the date of this impressive structure is the tenth century B.C., a time of revived building activity in the City of David as the capital of the United Kingdom. What was the function of this monumental construction? Somewhat to the north of it we began excavating an additional section in which was found a stone collapse, partly composed of ashlar masonry, indicating our close proximity to an important public building. It should be stressed that a very short distance to the north of our section Kenyon discovered the only Israelite palmette capital found thus far in Jerusalem, examples of which are known to us from other public royal centers, such as Hazor, Samaria, Ramat Rachel and Megiddo. We are, therefore, in the immediate vicinity of an important area within the city, composed of public structures of major importance, to judge by their dimensions and quality of construction. The stone, stepped structure under consideration consequently com posed part of this massive system. Even the most general glance leaves the impression that we are dealing with a substructure of enormous proportions, in my opinion, situated on the border of the upper part of the City of David. The aerial photographs illustrate better than any other means the location of this structure in relation to the other parts of the city. It should be remembered that in her Area H, Kenyon found part of a fortification defined by her as a casement wall of the tenth century B.C. Somewhat to the south of this structure and lower on the slope, Kenyon excavated similar structural remains which she likewise dated to the tenth century B.C. Further below on the slope we know the line of the outer city wall, 70 meters of which were excavated until now in Area E. We are apparently dealing with a portion of the skeletal structure of the architectural and fortification system in a major part of Jerusalem dating from the tenth century B.C., when it became the capital of Israel and</page><page sequence="6">144 YIGAL SH1L0H Judah. If our interpretation is correct, we have made an important step forward in the archaeological investigation of the topography, urban plan, and planning of the capital and in determining the southern boundary of the acropolis-fortress, that central area situated between the Temple Mount proper and the city itself, which may later have been called in our sources the "Ophel." This lofty, massive, and outstanding architectural phenomenon is undoubtedly morphologically appropriate for the meaning of the term "Ophel." Even though in the instance of Jerusalem the term is assigned to the central, royal area of the upper city, it is clear that it was used to denote some specific areas of other royal centers as well, as reflected in the Ophel at Samaria (II Kings 5:24) and recorded by Mesha, King of Moab, as one of the elements in his work in Dibon. The picture of the City of David is thus being completed, with the bringing to light of the outer, lower city wall, the residential quarters, and the underground water systems, as well as the materialization of the frame of the acropolis, crowned by the Temple Mount. The City of David Excavations, 1981 (Photographs by Yitzhak Harari) No. 1: The City of David Excavations, Area G, 1981. At top are a tower and the city wall of Jerusalem from Second Temple times, dating to the Hasmonean and early Roman periods. Below them are seen structures from the end of the First Temple period (the late Israelite period) which were destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. In the center is the monumental stone, stepped structure, preserved to a height of 15 meters. This structure might have served as a fortification of the citadel of Jerusalem — the "Ophel" — from the 10th century B.C., when David and Solomon ruled, and Jerusalem was the capital of Israel and Judah. At the bottom are building remains from pre-Davidic, Canaanite Jerusalem — the City of Jebus — dating to the second millenium, B.C. No. 2: The City of David Excavations, Area E, 1981. At the center, beneath the massive dumps covering the eastern slope is the city wall, built atop the bedrock. The wall contains a number of architectural phases, beginning in the Middle Bronze Age II, or Patriarchal period, when it served the Canaanite city of the second millenium, B.C. That early wall served as the base and core of the Israelite city wall (seen clearly along the center of the photo) until it was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. Remains of the Israelite wall were exploited as late as the Hasmonean period for terrace walling along the eastern slope, until the latter was completely abandoned at the end of the Second Temple period, in 70 A.D.</page><page sequence="7">10//////} //i '; mW, /!
