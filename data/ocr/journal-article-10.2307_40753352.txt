<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Problem of Anthropomorphism in a Hitherto Unknown Passage from Samuel ibn Tibbon's Maamar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim and in a Newly-Discovered Letter by David ben Saul* Carlos Fraenkel In this paper I will be chiefly concerned with a hitherto unknown pas- sage from Samuel Ibn Tibbon's (ca. 1160 - ca. 1232) philosophical-ex- egetical work, Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim (Treatise 'Let the Waters be Gathered').1 The passage has the character of a short independent work, which probably was incorporated by Ibn Tibbon into an already existing version of MYM. It is of considerable interest for a number of reasons. Editors' Note: Circumstances prevented the inclusion of this article in K. Herr- mann, M. Schlüter, and G.

Among others, it contains a long quotation from an otherwise lost letter of David b. Saul, who was one of the leaders of the anti-rationalist movement in the first Maimonidean con- troversy, and seems to have been influenced by concepts originating in the circles of the Haside Ashkenaz and of early Provencal Kabbalah.2 From Ibn Tibbon's vehement reply to this letter we learn not only about the aggressive tone of the discussion, but also about his personal invol- vement in the polemical exchanges, which eventually led to the eruption of the controversy in the early 1230s. Moreover, an issue of more philo- sophical than historical interest is found in a long digression at the end of the passage, in which Ibn Tibbon presents an elaborate criticism of Maimonides' first commandment in the Mishneh Torah: "to know [VT1?] that there is a First Existent f|W*n 'ixn]," and of his exegesis of Exodus 20:2, from which the commandment is supposedly derived.3 Ibn Tibbon's argument illustrates well an aspect of his relationship to Maimonides to which scholars have paid little attention until now: his disagreement with Maimonides on a wide range of important philoso- phical issues. It also illustrates the peculiar way in which Ibn Tibbon carried out his criticism: instead of rejecting Maimonides' position di- rectly, he transformed the disputed philosophical question into an exegetical issue. At stake, however, is not only what for Maimonides constitutes the Torah's "great principle, on which everything depends [ia '»I^D *?DntP],"4 but also the Biblical basis of a central metaphysical doctrine in the Guide of the Perplexed. In his commentary on Guide I, 63, Moses of Salerno makes reference to Ibn Tibbon's criticism of Mai- monides, and points out that it "contradicts everything that the Master [i. e., Maimonides] revealed and explained in this chapter [Ho *?D imo HT pisa lirai ain n^W]."5 If this conclusion is correct, Ibn Tibbon 2 On the impact that the reception of Maimonidean philosophy had on the devel- opment of mystical doctrines, see in particular: M.

I wish to thank Caterina Rigo for drawing my attention to Moses of Salerno's reference to MYM 20 which led me to the discovery of the passage in question. Since I was unable to locate the reference in M. L. Bisliches' edition of the text, published in Pressburg in 1837, I examined the manuscripts of MYM and discovered that Moses of Saler- no's quotations came from a long passage entirely missing in Bisliches' edition. The passage is extant in most but not all manuscripts of MYM. It is thus safe to assume that the manuscript Bisliches used for his edi- tion belonged to the small group of manuscripts not containing the passage. Bisliches' manuscript itself appears to be lost. I will not be able to examine all aspects of the newly discovered passage in the present paper. In the first part, my focus will be on the debate between Maimonideans and anti-Maimonideans on the correct interpretation of God's anthropomorphic representation in the Bible and in rabbinical literature, which is its main subject. The implications of Ibn Tibbon's criticism of Maimonides' first commandment and its exegetical derivation will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.6 This section of the passage is only loosely related to its main discussion; Ibn Tibbon himself explains that he included it in order "to atone [1DD1?]" for having "wasted time with the refution of [David b. Saul's] vain claims [D^nnn VltTM]" (349).7 In the second part of the paper, I will briefly describe all extant manuscripts of MYM and address a number of philological questions. Beyond laying the ground for the passage's edition, this part is also intended as a contribution for a future edition of the treatise as a whole. In the last part, finally, I will present an edition of the passage in question.

Samuel ibn Tibbon versus David b. Saul on Anthropomorphism The passage in MY M 20 is above all a document of the polemical debate between rationalists, who adopted Maimonides' philosophical interpre- tation of Judaism, and their opponents, who rejected it.8 With regard to the latter, the evidence contained in the passage seems to corroborate G. Scholem's conjecture that they were in some form influenced by mystical doctrines stemming from the literature of the Haside Ashkenaz and from the circles of early Provencal Kabbalah. The main issue, around which the debate revolves, is the question of the correct interpretation of Bib- lical verses and passages in rabbinical literature describing God in anthropomorphic terms. What ignited Ibn Tibbon's fury was that in his view "the ignoramuses who have no wisdom but pretend to be wise [HMn VÒ1 D'öannan D^DOn]" (11) were led by their "polluted imagi- nation [DrDJn DJVoi]" (13) to understand God's anthropomorphic re- presentations "literally [DOWSD]" (75), and not, as they should have, "allegorically [&gt;Wön K1W K1?]" (78). Ibn Tibbon is particularly out- raged by the fact that they appear to attribute "magnitude [TlSPtP]" (14) to God. But the problem of the belief in a corporeal God is not only that it is false. More serious in his view is that it ultimately leads to "idolatry [mr nmy]" (339 ff). Since Ibn Tibbon considered God's incorporeality to be demonstrated, the worship of a God conceived as corporeal was for him the worship of a being that is not God.9 The immediate context of his attack is the discussion of the first verse of Psalm 104 in MYM 20. The subject matter of the chapter as a whole is a detailed commentary on Psalm 104, which, together with the last four verses of Psalm 103, constitutes in Ibn Tibbon's view King David's exposition of the Account of the Beginning}0 The first verse of Psalm 8 For a full bibliography on the first Maimonidean controversy, cf. J. I. Dienstag, "The Moreh Nevukhim Controversy - An Annotated Bibliography," in: F. Rosner, Abraham Maimonides' Wars of the Lord and the Maimonidean Controversy. Haifa: The Maimonides Research Institute, 2000, 154-200. 9 For Maimonides' demonstrations of God's existence, unity and incorporeality, see Guide II, 1. According to Maimonides, God's incorporeality belongs to the most fun- damental principles of Judaism, which ought "to be made clear to everyone according to his capacity, and which ought to be transmitted by means of traditional authority to children, women, fools, and those who are devoid of intellect [D^DD1?! 0^3*71 D^üp1? *?3tPn nonVi], in the same way as God's unity, God's eternity, and that none but He should be worshipped" {Guide I, 35; I translate from Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew version, ed. Y. Even Shmuel, Jerusalem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook, 1987, 69). God's incorporeality is the third of Maimonides' "Thirteen Prinicples," listed in his Commentary on the Mis- hnah (Pereq Heleq).

For the theory</page><page sequence="5">(2004) Samuel ibn Tibbon 's Ma 'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 87 104, however, does not refer to the account of the six days of creation as related in the first chapter of Genesis, for the latter, according to Ibn Tibbon, who on this point is at variance with Maimonides, describes only the coming-to-be of the world below the sphere of the moon.11 Only in the second verse "David, peace be upon him . . . starts exposing the Account of the Beginning [mtWCO nttfJ/fc T1D02 ... 7'"V TH ^rinn]." What, then, is the content of the first verse? "Bless the Lord, O my soul - O Lord my God, You are very great [7NÖ rf?*tt], You dress in magnifi- cence and splendor [nttfD1? nm 7in]." In the hands of as skilled an allegorist as Ibn Tibbon, the striking anthropomorphism of this verse is easily transformed into a summary of Aristotle's account of the world above the sphere of the moon. God's "greatness" represents his ontolo- gical rank as the first "cause of all that exists [KXÖ3 tt 7ÙV]" The "magnificence" represents the Serafim, i. e., the angels emanating from God, who are like God himself "intellects separate from matter [DDVîf? DH D* "nS3 *?DW]." The "splendor" represents the "celestial spheres, which are the throne of the glory [ilMn KDD DHW DTP^yn D'nvn];" they emanate from God "through the mediation of the Serafim" (124). 12 Finally, the "dressing" in magnificence and splendor as if they were God's garment, is an "allegorical representation of the notion of emana- tion [5/Siwn "pay nan ^ttnn]." "An understanding person," Ibn Tibbon contends, "whom God has graced with a small amount of intelligence would have no doubt that [David's] saying 'You dress in magnificence and splendor' is said by way of allegory [*?Wö "p7 10X3]." The absurdity of a literal understanding, according to him, is obvious for two reasons. First, one cannot literally dress in magnificence and splendor, and second, "even if they were bodies like a garment . . .

At this point Ibn Tibbon interrupts his exegesis of Psalm 104 in order to pour out his wrath over "the ignoramuses" who understand the verses literally: [T]hey imagine God as a body dressing in garments. Accordingly, He would have magnitude in their corrupted belief. This is thus, for the garment contains [Tpö] that which is dressed in it, and everything that is contained [Hpiö] is limited F?3JUD] through its container, and everything limited has magnitude [11 WW ^V2] on account of its limits. For them He is the great and powerful glory, subject to measure [137 itPöH], which they have invented [im*n3], and which they conceive as sitting in heaven - 'sitting' in the literal sense - and as descending and ascending - 'descent' and 'ascent' in the literal sense. For them He also has a place in the literal sense. (14-18) In order to prove that this, in his view, absurd notion of God is indeed maintained by his opponents, and in order to illustrate their "corrupt and empty belief," Ibn Tibbon quotes the "beginning of a letter [tPXI nnD]" written "as an apology [nV?xann fn *?y]" by a "particularly ignorant person [inVrDOa WP» 7rtt&lt;]" (28-30). After the quotation, apparently in view to prevent the suspicion of forgery, Ibn Tibbon em- phasizes that the letter in his possession is an autograph: written in the "handwriting of the ignoramus, its author, according to the testimony of his neighbors, the inhabitants of his city [Ho •&gt;&amp; intmy ^DOH M'llM *rn inrrrotp i-py ^n v»v ivynw]" (72-73).13 Ibn Tibbon does not mention the name of the letter's author, but I was able to identify him as David b. Saul, the disciple of Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier, and like the latter, one of the protagonists of the anti-rationalist movement in the first Maimonidean controversy.14 The identification is based on Abraham b. Maimonides' discussion of the same letter in his account of the controversy in The Wars of the Lord}5 Abraham relates in some detail the content of two documents which were sent to him from Acco in 1235 together with a report of the 13 The Maimonideans were indeed accused by Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier of using forged documents in order to promote their cause, and there is some evidence indicating that this accusation may have been justified.

One document was the "text of the letter [noia SriDn]," which Solomon b. Abraham sent to the "Rabbis of France." The other was the "text of the declaration of faith [naiaKH noi:]," in which "David b. Saul revealed his secret ßiiw p TH mo 12 TfrlW]" (57). Neither of the documents has been preserved independently, but, as we will see below, the second is the letter quoted by Ibn Tibbon. The main issue, which prompted Abraham to deal with and to refute the two documents, was that in his view Solomon b. Abraham and David b. Saul "in their belief made an image of the Creator without being aware of it [wnn K*?1 mían Klin1? WV Dminxa]" (60). Solomon b. Abraham apparently claimed that this is "the belief of the Talmud which some reject [m DnD13 w "Tia^nn *?&amp; nnaxn]," a claim which, according to Abraham, followed from his and David b. Saul's belief in the "literal sense of some passages in the Midrash and in the Aggadah [DXpa tWD rrmnm muman]" (61). As a consequence of this misunderstanding they transgressed - unconsciously in Abraham's view - the Biblical pro- hibition to make an image of God. The remainder of the discussion of Solomon's letter to the French rabbis is, however, not concerned with the issue of anthropomorphism, to which Abraham only returns in his examination of David b. Saul's "declaration of faith." It seems that he considered his rejection of David b. Saul's claims as valid also in view of similar statements made by Solomon b. Abraham: Let us now speak about the issue of the declaration of faith [naiaKH "pay] written by David b. Saul. With regard to him, Solomon [b. Abraham] said in his letter that only two people were sufficiently strong to fight with him the battle for his belief. Of these David b. Saul is one [lay Dn*?n*? ptnna I'Ktt Dna in« VlKtt p TIT HT D'ttttK *W pi inaiala] ... And from [an examina- tion of] his [David's] replies [vmaitPn linai] concerning his, this David's, belief, and [the belief of] his teacher or friend, Solomon, we will respond to that which Solomon said in his letter concerning his belief in the Throne of the Glory and [his belief] in the Partition [innm na*?tP ia«V na bv mm nsrnam man kod3 naiaan raya]. (69) Abraham then presents and refutes David b. Saul's claims. Let us exam- ine a few passages from his discussion, which in my view leave little doubt that the document which he attributes to David b. Saul is the same as the one quoted by Ibn Tibbon. I will first give the relevant passages from Ibn Tibbon's quotation, followed by the parallel passages in the Wars of the Lord: min mai n^ny lanax •»d -ia**1? ... wann1? ... d*ti nm Tiyaw 'ir aeran *737 *npa3 ûmo«îi onnntn iKtzn n*?ym i^nn"» xnn1?</page><page sequence="8">90 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 natrman rm ira*»*? *?y n^y írtn inai *ò üViya nwa ia1? n^m Dn^iwsa aun D^awa atzrr 'rr own *d na D^ma urna ntPK irnriaio irny-r ht i« *t *?y ox "o mas '»asa D"pnn^ nay1?

God forbid that we do this! We never expressed this thought, and it never crossed our mind, but our opinion and our belief, which we maintain, is this: that God, may He be blessed, sits in heaven, and that this is the foundation of his rank, and that no created being can stand and subsist in front of His glory except by means of a partition separating between Him and His creatures, as in the verse "and a mist is His garment" [Job 38:9]. Concerning this our Sages said in the Treatise Hagigah that "darkness and mist surround Him" [bT Hagi- gah, 12b]. ... And we have not found that the great glory appeared to Israel other than from within a cloud or a mist, except for [its appearance] in the cave in which Moses and Elijah stood when the glory entered it without a cloud.

And they said that He, may His name be blessed, appeared without a cloud in a cave, in which Moses and Elijah stood. (Wars of the Lord, 69-72) Although Abraham does not quote David b. Saul's defense of his and Solomon's belief verbatim, the parallels concerning content, terminol- ogy and references to biblical and rabbinical passages in my opinion</page><page sequence="9">(2004) Samuel ibn Tibbon's Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 91 suffice to show that he is discussing the same document that is quoted by Ibn Tibbon. It is not clear how much of David b. Saul's original defense has been preserved. The quotation ends somewhat abruptly, and Ibn Tibbon states that he has copied the entire text in his posses- sion,16 which, as already mentioned, he introduces as the "beginning [W*n]" of a letter. It seems, therefore, plausible to assume that the quo- tation in MY M 20 corresponds to the first part of the document. As far as I can judge, Abraham b. Maimonides' discussion does not presup- pose more than what is contained in this quotation, but it is quite pos- sible that the copy which was sent to him was made from Ibn Tibbon's version of the text. If we turn now to Abraham's discussion of the document's content we note his puzzlement over what seemed to him a contradiction in terms in David b. Saul's defense: "You sit in the darkness of ignorance," he writes, "wisdom being superior to ignorance as light is superior to darkness, because first you assert that He, may His name be blessed, has no like- ness, corporeal image and bodily parts [DnaKI *yu miam mai], and then you take up the issue again and attribute to Him, may His name be blessed, a certain place, and a partition of darkness [D^oa Dlpa ■"[Win Vw nirnai]" (70). This apparent inconsistency also puzzled Ibn Tibbon. On the one hand, David b. Saul rejects the accusation "that we attribute likeness and form to the Creator, may He be blessed." On the other hand, he describes God as sitting in heaven surrounded by a cloud and by darkness. It is thus not surprising that Ibn Tibbon spares no effort to show the futility of the defense, and how, despite the author's disclai- mer at the beginning, the letter bears witness to his belief that the anthro- pomorphic representations of God ought to be understood literally. Ibn Tibbon's explanation for David b. Saul's apparent inconsistency is that his rejection refers only to the matter but not to the shape of the corpor- eal features predicated of God, i. e., to the attribution "of hand, foot and the other bodily parts" made "of flesh, bones, sinews, and the remaining components of the parts of the human body" (95-96). God's hands and feet in Ibn Tibbon's understanding of David b. Saul are, therefore, of the same shape but not of the same material as human hands and feet. David b. Saul's exposé of his beliefs certainly does not excel in clarity. But a careful examination of the text shows that it is based on a much more complicated theology than Ibn Tibbon and Abraham b. Maimo- nides seem to have realized. Neither of them discusses a somewhat en- igmatic sentence towards the end of the document, which in my view 16 See line 72: "MTiX nron 0S1ÜB ''T1? X3 "JKD *ry."</page><page sequence="10">92 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 11 leaves little doubt that David b. Saul was committed to a non-anthro- pomorphic concept of God. The mystical doctrines underlying the state- ment probably were too far removed from their frame of reference in order to be understood by them. David b. Saul writes: ft rã waa *7XK3tp nifi *?sk Vm ft w&gt; Vmn man *a '»ik ukw s"y*o .[a i mytrr&gt;] itqd pian *?3 a1?»' naxa nt *?sn tod *np&gt;a nt dai Vaa And although we say that the great glory has a limit - but that which truly emanated has no limit, and this [the true emanation] is also called 'glory,' and with regard to this [the true emanation] it is said "the whole earth is filled with His glory" [Isaiah 6:3]. Underlying this statement is a distinction between two notions of "glory": the glory which "has no limit" and which "truly" emanated, and the glory which "has a limit" and apparently emanated only in some qualified sense. Presumably the unlimited glory emanated directly from God and is, in its turn, the source of the limited glory. The attri- bute "true" would thus distinguish between an unmediated and a mediated emanation from God. Despite David b. Saul's admission that the "great glory" has a number of features, which for Ibn Tibbon and Abraham b. Maimonides imply a corporeal concept of God, it appears to follow from the sentence just quoted that he did not consider them to be features of God, but of an emanated being located two levels below God. David b. Saul does not seem to make a distinction between the entity referred to as "glory" or "great glory" and the entity referred to by a wide range of traditional divine names, although the text is not particularly clear on this point. The divine names include "the Creator" (32, 33), "Ha-Shem" (35), "Elohim" (40, in the quotation of Exodus 20:19), the Tetragrammaton (41, in the quotation of Deuteronomy 5:19) and "the Holy One, Blessed be He" (44). If indeed there is no distinction, all attributes predicated of God by David b. Saul would apply neither to God, insofar as he is the first cause, nor to the unlim- ited "great glory," which "truly" emanated from him. Instead, they would apply only to the limited "great glory," i. e., to the third entity in the hierarchy of the divine world. This limited glory, therefore, "sits in heaven" with "a partition separating" it from its creatures (35-37), is endowed with "a power so great" that it "burns even the angels" (45), does not appear to Israel except "from within a cloud and a mist" (51), and so forth. How much of these descriptions David b. Saul intended to be understood literally is not clear. He is explicit only with regard to the "limit" of the "great glory," probably referring to the "partition," which protects the creatures from destruction through its power. The "parti-</page><page sequence="11">(2004) Samuel ihn Tibbon 's Ma 'amar Yiqqawu ha- M ay im 93 tion," again, he apparently saw variously represented by the "mist," the "darkness," and the "cloud." Now, whatever the precise meaning of this limitation, it clearly does not imply the glory's visibility in any compre- hensive sense. For Moses, according to David b. Saul's interpretation of Exodus 33:18, "desired to see" the glory (47-48), and received as an answer that "no one shall see Me and live" (Exodus 33:20). Only in one instance were Moses and Elijah able to apprehend the glory "with- out a cloud" (52), namely in a mysterious cave, which according to David b. Saul was created before the creation of the world, and which for him is the only created being with "the power to hold the great glory p7Tnn TQDH pnnn1? m m tzr»]" (54-55). Although the author uses rabbinical traditions for the account of the glory's appearance in the cave, he reworked them to the point that Ibn Tibbon accuses him of having "invented" the whole story. But more important for our discus- sion is that from this account it appears to follow that even the limited glory is not the entity apprehended by the prophets and to which the majority of anthropomorphic attributes in the Bible and in rabbinical literature refer. It is, therefore, possible that the hierarchy of emanations, on which David b. Saul's theological system is based, included addi- tional entities not discussed in the letter as we have it. The precise sources which influenced David b. Saul's distinction be- tween God and his twofold emanated glory need yet to be determined. In a first approach it seems to me fruitful to pursue G. Scholem's con- jecture, according to which the defense of Solomon b. Abraham and David b. Saul contained "esoteric and mystical doctrines similar to those found in the circle of the Rabad and, above all, reminiscent of the style and presentation current among the French and German Hasidim. ... It seems that they too had already combined the mysticism of the kabhod with the older form of Provencal Kabbalah."17 Given the scope of both the primary and the secondary material, a comprehensive investigation into David b. Saul's possible sources along the lines suggested by Scholem is far more than I can accomplish in the present paper. I will limit myself, therefore, to a few tentative remarks, first about the role of the concept of the divine glory in the theology of the different schools of the Haside Ashkenaz on the basis of J. Dan's detailed studies,18 and second, on some aspects of the theology of Rabbi 17 G. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, ed. R. J. Werblowsky, Eng. trans, by A. Arkush, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press 1987, 406-407. [henceforth: Scho- lem, Origins]. Scholem's conjecture is based on Abraham b. Maimonides' discussion of David b. Saul's defense. 18 See J. Dan, The Esoteric Theology of Ashkenazi Hasidism, Jerusalem: Bialik In-</page><page sequence="12">94 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 Abraham b. David, i. e., the Rabad, which in my view are relevant to our discussion. Although the doctrine of the divine glory as developed by the Haside Ashkenaz has multiple facets which differ from school to school, one can say in general that it is conceived as an emanation in the Neoplatonic sense, mediating between a transcendent and entirely inaccessible God, and the created world. The anthropomorphic attributes found in the Bi- ble and in rabbinical literature do not, therefore, refer to God himself, but usually describe a certain aspect of the glory or of an entity related to it.19 Let us take a brief look at some variations of this basic structure, which may have had an influence on David b. Saul's notion of a twofold glory. In a text attributed to Judah the Pious, the glory is described as having two faces: one that "creatures have no power to see, and about which it is said 'you shall not see My face' (Exodus 33:20) for [it is turned] towards the essence of the Creator [mían D2W ^DW];" the other "is not [turned] towards the essence of the Creator but towards the creatures ["»D^D D*m33n]" and "is seen by the prophets [miK^ D'K'331? ina]."20 A different doctrine is found in the Book of Life [D"nn ISO], in which God's glory is described as filling "the whole world, above and below," or, with an implicit reference to Isaiah 3:6, as "the king of the world [D^iyn *f?a], whose glory fills the whole earth."21 Moreover, the glory apparently is conceived as being at the same time one and multiple: one if considered in itself, and multiple with regard to its activity in the stitute, 1968 [Hebrew], 104-168 [henceforth: Dan, Esoteric Theology]. Dan also pub- lished studies of a number of aspects of the literature of the Haside Ashkenaz in: Studies in Ashkenazi-Hasidic Literature [Hebrew], Ramat Gan: Massada, 1975 [hence- forth: Dan, Studies]. See also a summary of the discussion in J. Dan, "The Emergence of Jewish Mysticism in Medieval Germany," in: idem, Jewish Mysticism, vol. II: The Middle Ages, Northvale: Jason Aronson Inc., 1998, 19-63, in particular 42-50. Cf. already G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, New York: Schocken Books, 1946, 111-116. 19 See Dan's summary of the doctrine's main traits in Esoteric Theology, 169-170. For the doctrine's sources, in particular in the work of Saadia Gaon and of Abraham ibn Ezra, see Dan, Esoteric Theology, 104-116. Note that in some systems the anthropomorphic features apparently were explained psychologically, and not as features of an emanation in the divine world. See for example, Dan, Esoteric Theology, 131-133, 149-150. 20 See Dan, Esoteric Theology, 134-135. Note that the Tetragrammaton is used as a name for this lower face of the glory. 21 Ibidem, 143, 146. Note that in this work the glory occupies only the forth place in the hierarchy of the divine world (ibidem, 146). According to Dan, Isaiah 3:6, which we saw quoted also by David b. Saul, is frequently used in the literature of the Haside Ashkenaz in the context of "the doctrine of the glory and the immanence of the glory" (ibidem).

Saul, uses the term "m^XX" for "emanation."25 It distinguishes between the glory and the "Unique Cherub," describing the former as being emanated on the latter, which itself is not emanated.26 Among others, the "Unique Cherub" is said to have been created from God's "great fire."27 He sits on "the throne of the glory [TIM H XOD]", which is surrounded by a "cloud [py]... in order to separate between it and the animals [Vinn*? nrnn r^ I^a]."28 Finally, the "Unique Cherub," according to this circle, is the entity apprehended by the prophets, and thus also the entity to which the anthropomorphic attributes in the Bible and in rabbinical literature refer. Let us now turn to Abraham b. David, and the early Kabbalah in Provence.29 In a famous gloss Abraham b. David criticized Maimonides' ruling in the Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 3:7, that a person be- lieving that God "is a body and has an image [HJlön *?sm TU KintP]," is a "heretic fpö]." Abraham b. David objects that scholars "greater and bet- ter than him [IJöö O^iüi D^Ttt]," i. e., than Maimonides, accepted the anthropomorphic representation of God.30 Scholem suggests that this 22 Dan, Esoteric Theology, 150-151. 23 Ibidem, 149. Note that in contrast to Judah the Pious, the author of the Book of Life does not consider the glory to be the entity apprehended by the prophets. From this point of view the glory is hidden like God himself. 24 On this group, see also Dan's recent book with full bibliography: The "Unique Cherub" Circle: A School of Mystics and Esoterics in Medieval Germany, Tübingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 1999. 25 Dan, Esoteric Theology, 157. Normally, the term "mp^l" is used for "emana- tion" in the literature of the Haside Ashkenaz. 26 Ibidem, 159-160, 162. Note that also for the "Unique Cherub" circle the glory is not the first emanation from the hidden God. See ibidem, 164. In one passage quoted by Dan it is described as "filling the whole world" (162). 27 Ibidem, 162. The other entities, according to this account, were created from a different fire, inferior to the divine fire from which the "Unique Cherub" was created. 28 Ibidem, 159. 29 On Abraham b. David, see I. Twersky, Rabad of Posquieres, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1962 [henceforth: Twersky, Rabad'. On his relationship to Kabbalah, see in particular 286-300. 30 Maimonides, SM, 221.

Heller Willensky, M. Idei (eds.), Studies in Jewish Thought, Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1989 [Hebrew], 68-78, in particular 69-74 [henceforth: Harvey, "Incorporeality"]. In the continuation of the above quoted gloss, Abraham b. David seems to admit that anthropomorphic passages</page><page sequence="14">96 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 objection does not imply that Abraham b. David conceived God in anthropomorphic terms.31 Rather, it should be understood in light of a distinction which reveals "the mystical intent behind the apology for anthropomorphism."32 This distinction is found in the explanation of a notorious anthropomorphic passage in bT Berakhot 6a, reported in Abraham b. David's name by his grandson, Asher b. David: In the treatise Berakhot [this is] the explanation of the great Master, R. Abraham ben David, my grandfather [for the dictum:] 'Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, puts on tefillin? This refers to the prince of the countenance, whose name is like the name of his Master [D^SH "IW *?J7 im DWD latPtP]. But perhaps there is one above him who emanated from the Highest Cause [nrp^yn HDOH p *?XXJ], and in whom there is supreme power. And it is he who appeared to Moses in the burning bush, who ap- peared to Ezekiel in the vision of the man above [cf. Ezekiel 1:26] and to the other prophets. But the Cause of Causes [nV?yn ]f?37] did not [appear], no left and no right, no front and no back. And this is the secret [referred to] in the Account of the Beginning [JTtPina ntPtfo]: Whoever knows the measure of the maker of the beginning [rpvmn 1XV bw nir»], can be assured of his share in the world to come, and for this reason it was said: 'And let us make man in our image' [Genesis 1:26]. Before discussing the content of this tradition attributed to Abraham b. David, a textual problem needs to be addressed. The passage was first published by Moshe Soave in 1863 from a manuscript copied in 1397.33 in the Bible and in the Midrash "corrupt the opinions [msnn nx mvatPID]." Harvey interprets "opinions," as "intellectual cognitions" (ibidem, 70, n. 23) and suggests that Abraham b. David "in all probability did not oppose Maimonides' claim, according to which the incorporeality of God is a metaphysical doctrine following from the belief in God's unity" (ibidem, 70). He did, however, in Harvey's view, consider the philosophi- cal truth to be "irrelevant for the basic values of Judaism" (ibidem). In my opinion the mystical doctrines to which Abraham b. David apparently adhered (see my discussion below) make the assumption unnecessary that he was committed to some degree to a philosophical concept of God. Although the philosophical and the mystical doctrines do not exclude each other, and, as Harvey points out, allow a similar interpretation of the gloss in question (ibidem, 73), the assumption that Abraham b. David was com- mitted to the latter has the advantage of being supported by a text. Cf. also Twersky, for whom "there is not a shadow of doubt that Rabad was personally committed to the traditional Jewish view which maintained the unlikeness and incorporeality of God as an indispensable corollary of the existence and unity of God" (Rabad, 283-284). In my view this claim, which assumes that Abraham b. David was a good Maimonidean, is apologetic. 31 For medieval attempts to reconcile Abraham b. David's gloss with Maimonides, see Harvey, "Incorporeality," 71. For the reasons, which make these attempts very difficult to defend, see ibidem, 71-72. Twersky, Rabad, 286 appears to accept the re- conciliation as valid. 32 Scholem, Origins, 211. 33 In: Osar NehmadlV (1863), 37. On the MS used by Soave, see D. Abrams, "From Divine Shape to Angelic Being: The Career of Akatriel in Jewish Literature," Journal of</page><page sequence="15">(2004) Samuel ihn Tibbon 's Ma 'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 97 In this MS the sentence: "But perhaps there is one above him who emanated from the Highest Cause, and in whom there is supreme power" is marked as a "gloss [nrun]." Scholem in 1948 quoted the text from a different MS, which does not mark the sentence as a gloss.34 According to D. Abrams, in fact "two families of manuscripts" exist, of which one identifies the sentence as a gloss, the other does not.35 In his discussions of Abraham b. David, Scholem nowhere questioned the authenticity of the sentence, interpreting it as an integral part of the text.36 As Abrams pointed out, however, the fact that one branch of the MS tradition transmits the sentence as a gloss makes it more plau- sible to consider it "a later addition," originally made on the manu- script's margin by "a relatively early Kabbalistic figure."37 For our pre- sent purpose it is not crucial to find a conclusive answer to the question of the sentence's author. More important is the structural similarity between the theology of the version including the gloss and the theology underlying David b. Saul's defense. Both suggest a threefold division of the divine world: for the former it consists of God, an entity "emanated" from God, in which "there is supreme power," and the prince of the countenance; for the latter it consists of God, the "truly" emanated "great glory" which is unlimited, and the "great glory" which is lim- ited.38 Moreover, both use the language of "emanation," both consider the lowest entity to have respectively "measure" or "limitation," and both consider this entity to be the subject of which anthropomorphic features are predicated. Although the two texts differ on the question of whether the third entity in the divine world is the object of prophetic Religion 76 (1996), 43-63, here: 58, note 49 [henceforth: Abrams, "Divine Shape"]. Abrams published the text from the same MS in his R. Asher b. David: His Complete Works and Studies in His Kabbalistic Thought, Los Angeles: Cherub Press, 1996, 141. 34 In: Reshit ha-Qabbalah, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1948 [Hebrew], 75-76 [henceforth: Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah]. 35 Abrams, "Divine Shape," 57. For references to MSS, see ibidem, note 56. 36 See Reshit ha-Qabbalah, 75-76, and Origins, 214. Also Twersky, Rabad, 289-290, n. 14 treats the sentence as it if it came from Abraham b. David's hand. 37 Abrams, "Divine Shape," 57. Note also the terminological difference with regard to God as the first cause: whereas the gloss has "the highest cause [ruv^yn mon]," the main text has "the cause of causes [m^yn n1?^]." Nonetheless, I would be less catego- rical than Abrams, who suggests that the gloss "can only be viewed as the later addi- tion of another." Ibidem, 57. On this issue, see also the very similar tradition attributed to Abraham b. David by Jacob Ibn Habib, in: Ein Ya'aqov on Ta 'ani t h Idi, in which the "prince of the world [D^iyn It?]" is described precisely in the terms of the gloss. For Abrams the passage in Ein Ya'aqov is "a reworking of the above text [the text reported by Asher b. David] with its addition." Ibidem, 58. 38 Although the existence of the intermediate entity is posited only tentatively ("per- haps") in the tradition attributed to Abraham b. David.</page><page sequence="16">98 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 apprehension, the characteristics they share in my view suffice to make the tradition attributed to Abraham b. David an important document of the conceptual framework in which the theological doctrines of David b. Saul may have originated. As for the concept of divine glory in the different schools of the Ha- side Ashkenaz, the same cautious conclusion seems to me justified in light of the multiple similarities with regard to structure, function, ter- minology, and biblical references, notwithstanding the fact that none of the concept's versions briefly examined above seems to have had a direct influence on David b. Saul. It is important to note in this context that "the doctrine of the Glory and the cherub upon the Throne" of the Haside Ashkenaz appears to have influenced the development of early Provencal Kabbalah, of which the tradition attributed to Abraham b. David is an example. Moreover, some texts bear witness to a process of "amalgamation" of notions stemming from the two systems.39 The lack of clarity of David b. Saul's text and the sometimes confused theol- ogy informing it, may well reflect the early stage of such a process of amalgamation, in which traditions that originated in different contexts were not yet reorganized into a consistent new form. From the investigation into David b. Saul's possible sources let us now return to the polemical debate to which the passage in MY M 20 bears witness. If my interpretation of the doctrines under discussion is correct, the real dispute between philosophers and mystics is not so much about the acceptance or rejection of the anthropomorphic repre- sentation of God, but rather about the solution to the problem posed by this representation. All sides agree on the non-anthropomorphic nature of God insofar as he is the first cause, and it is interesting to recall in this context, how Nachmanides tried to demonstrate that the anti-Mai- monideans were committed to the unity and transcendence of God as much as the Maimonideans. In his famous epistle, intended to reconcile the two camps, he quotes a passage from the work of Eleazar of Worms, a central figure of the Haside Ashkenaz movement, which elaborates on the distinction between the hidden God who has "no face, back and height ... and no limitation [*71Dä] and no bodily parts [D"H3N]" and the "visible glory [riNIJ HDD]" which was apprehended by the pro- phets.40 The contentious issue, then, is not the nature of God, but how 39 See Scholem, Origins, 215-216. Cf. Twersky, Rabad, 288. 40 See the letter in The Writings of R. Mosheh b. Nahman, ed. C. B. Chavel, Jerusa- lem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook 1963, vol. I, 336-348. The passage from Eleazar of Worms' Gates of the Secret, the Unity and the Faith occurs on pp. 346-347. Cf. J.

The philoso- phers reconcile the incorporeal Aristotelian God with the God of the Bible through allegorical interpretation.41 The mystics on the other hand tend to defend a literal reading of anthropomorphic passages, in which they see, however, not a representation of God but of an ema- nated being. It seems clear, therefore, that the attack of both Ibn Tibbon and Abraham b. Maimonides misses the crucial point on which David b. Saul's apology hinges. The fact that David b. Saul in his letter rejects a number of allegorical interpretations of biblical verses which Maimo- nides had elaborated in different exegetical contexts in the Guide, ap- pears thus consistent with his approach in this matter.42 The importance of the exegetical question for the first Maimonidean controversy in gen- eral, and concerning Ibn Tibbon in particular, is highlighted, moreover, in a passage of a letter by Solomon b. Abraham to Isaac b. Samuel, written around 1231-1232:43 We who love and revere the Torah that God has commanded us, heard some of [the Maimonideans], old and young, spreading new ideas [D^öOISö D^ttnn D'Ha'T], ... which their forefathers would not have conceived. They pursue an evil way following their own thoughts [D materia] in order to destroy what was received by way of tradition [nV?Dpn OT"lîV?], and to invent parables [ü^Wö VltPö*?] with regard to the words of the Torah: to transform into a parable and delusion the Account of the Beginning, the story of Cain and Abel, and the other issues written in the Torah. And we have heard from the mouth of the translator [i. e., Ibn Tibbon], who revealed everything which the Master, may his memory be blessed, concealed [HD *?D TÙ^î "itPN Sin nODttf], saying in public [D^m •'JSD nniK TPrw] that all the stories [in the Torah] are parables [D^tPö DmDOn *?3], and all the commandments are customs [manan].44 I have examined elsewhere the evidence in Ibn Tibbon's work that may have provided the basis for Solomon b. Abraham's accusations.45 Of particular importance for the present context is that the letter bears witness both to Ibn Tibbon's personal involvement in the debates with the leaders of the anti-Maimonidean movement, and to the important role played by the question of allegorical exegesis. These debates, then, The Middle Ages, Northvale: Jason Aronson Inc., 1998, 179-200, in particular 180- 183. 41 In a sense this is the hermeneutical project carried out in the Guide, in particular in the lexicographic chapters of the first part. 42 See his discussion of Psalms 18:12, interpreted in Guide III, 9, of Ezekiel 3:12, interpreted in Guide I, 8, and of Deuteronomy 4:39, interpreted in Guide III, 32. 43 For the date see Silver, Maimonidean Controversy, 157, note 2. 44 The letter was published in: Qevusat Mikhtavim, éd.

Saul's letter included in MYM.46 Before we leave the dispute between Maimonideans and anti-Maimo- nideans, it is, I think, interesting to note that the conversion of anthro- pomorphic attributes from features of God into features of an entity emanated from God has an intriguing parallel in the Jewish rationalist tradition from Abraham ibn Ezra to Moses Narboni. Several medieval philosophers read, in fact, the most obnoxious document of Jewish anthropomorphism, the Shfur Qomah tradition, as a sublime treatise of metaphysics.47 The measures of God's body, on which the ShVur Qo- mah tradition elaborates in much detail, became for them the measure, i. e., the intelligible form, of the world emanated from God.48 The ema- nated world again, so Narboni in his Epistle on Shicur Qomah, is "an image of God, blessed be He ['»"WH nJlön]", because "all existents ... are in him in [their] most noble reality [invn niK^aa 13 DH ... D'KXöan ^D rmtPö]."49 But the parallel is not limited to this general resemblance. Narboni's treatise is presented as an explanation of Abraham ibn Ezra's Long Commentary on Exodus 33:21, in which many of the elements are found that we saw in the above-quoted tradition attributed to Abraham b. David: God putting on tefìllin, the prince of the countenance, Moses' vision of God, the quotation from the Shi'ur Qomah tradition concern- ing knowledge of the "measure of the maker of the beginning," and the connection of this tradition with the account of man's creation in God's image in Genesis 1:26.50 It is interesting to note in this context that Ibn 46 Cf. the letter of Solomon b. Abraham quoted above, who reports about having been involved over a long period in debates with the Maimonideans before the con- troversy turned violent. According to Silver, Maimonidean Controversy, these debates started "oossiblv as earlv as two decades before" the controversv itself. 47 According to Narboni it is the "fruit of the metaphysical sciences [nvròxn &lt;ns]."

David, whereas Kaplan suggests the ex-</page><page sequence="19">(2004) Samuel ibn Tibbon's Ma 'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 101 Ezra's ShVur Qomah interpretation and his interpretation of the vision of God's "face" and God's "back,"51 to which he relates the Shïur Qo- mah tradition in Yesod Mora 12, had a significant impact on the devel- opment of the doctrine of the divine glory in the circles of the Haside Ashkenaz.52 It seems, therefore, that in a sense Ibn Ezra can be consid- ered the point of departure of different, though to some degree parallel, developments in both medieval Jewish philosophy and mysticism. Although the philosophical interpretation of the anthropomorphic representation of God as a description of the world emanated from God is thus in a sense similar to its interpretation in the texts of the Haside Ashkenaz, of Abraham b. David and David b. Saul, the doctrine of the latter prima facie is less anthropomorphic than its philosophical counterpart! For the philosophers, God and the world share the same form. David b. Saul's distinction, on the other hand, between the "great glory" which is unlimited and the "great glory" which is limited, seems to imply that even these two emanated entities do not share a common measure, and a fortiori this must be true with regard to God. In light of Ibn Tibbon's harsh accusations, it is thus not devoid of irony that Nar- boni refers to no other than Maimonides as one of the authorities whom he followed in his Shiur Qomah interpretation. And at least in part he appears to be justified in doing so. In the seventh of his "Thirteen Prin- ciples," listed in the Commentary on Pereq Heleq (Sanhédrin 10), Mai- monides writes about the need to give a philosophical explanation to istence of an esoteric tradition underlying the two similar accounts. In my opinion the assumption of "influence" without further qualification is problematic in this context. Although the combination of elements found in the tradition attributed to Abraham b. David may have been suggested to him by Ibn Ezra, the resemblance should not ob- scure the difference between their respective general projects. As Altman in his intro- duction to Narboni, Shfur Qomah notes, "the limbs of the figure" for Ibn Ezra, are "the parts constituting the universe," the structure of which is identical to the system of forms contained in God's intellect. This, I think, does not correspond to Abraham b. David's understanding of the prince of the countenance and Shi'ur Qomah. It seems, therefore, more plausible to me that he was among others reacting to Ibn Ezra's ra- tionalist interpretation of mystical concepts. If Kaplan's suggestion of the existence of an esoteric tradition is correct, the text attributed to Abraham b. David may well reflect the attempt to reappropriate this tradition from a mystical perspective. 51 Cf. Exodus 33. 52 Cf. Dan, Esoteric Theology, 113-116, 138-145; see also Wolfson, "Metatron," in particular 71. Here again, I think, a note of caution is required. The use that the Haside Ashkenaz make of Ibn Ezra is certainly not a straightforward interpretation. It is, e. g. in my view improbable that Ibn Ezra understands the "face" in Yesod Mora 12 to be an aspect of an emanated being, as Judah the Pious interprets the passage, transforming the "face" into an aspect of the divine glory.

And included among these things is [the issue] of Shi'ur Qomah and its meaning [HKJyöi Hölp TISPIP iVi "»D 'mn]." The reason that prevented Maimonides from giving the explanation that he thought is required, was that it did not fit into his concise exposition of the "Thirteen Principles" of Judaism. "One hundred pages would not suffice," he writes, "for this issue alone ... and therefore I leave it for another occasion."53 Unfortunately, he never made good on his promise, but it seems to me quite plausible to assume that the explanation he had in mind was the same as the one alluded to by Ibn Ezra and later worked out by Narboni.54 2. Philological Aspects Concerning the Passage in MYM 20 In the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts (IMHM) in Jeru- salem nine MSS are listed to date, which contain all or most of MYM. In addition, seven fragments of varying scope have been identified. None of the fragments has the section of MYM 20 in which the passage occurs. From the nine complete or nearly complete MSS, seven contain the passage in question. Our earliest evidence for its existence, however, is the above mentioned quotation in Moses of Salerno's commentary on Guide I, 63. The commentary was composed and revised from the be- ginning of the 1260s to 1279, the year of the author's death.55 Of the 53 Commentary on the Mishnah, Ed. of the Arabic with Hebrew transi, by J. Kafih, 6 vols., Jerusalem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook, 1963-1964, vol. 5, 213. The sentence "And included among these things is [the issue] of Shi'ur Qomah and its meaning," was later deleted by Maimonides (see the discussion in the literature quoted in the following notei. The Arabic is given bv Kafih in note 42 ad locum. 54 Cf. A. Altmann, who in his introduction to Narboni, Shi'ur Qomah, suggests that Maimonides was "affected by the same outlook" concerning Shi'ur Qomah as Ibn Ezra. Only later does Maimonides seem to have changed his mind on the subject and deleted the sentence on Shi'ur Qomah from the Commentary on the Mishnah. Moreover, he rejected its authenticity in a Responsum. See Altmann's discussion of the matter in his introduction. For a different interpretation of the passage in the "Thirteen Principles," see R. Jospe, "Maimonides and 'Shi'ur Qomah'", in: M. Idei et al. (eds.), Minhah le- Sarah - Studies in Jewish Philosophy and Kabbalah, presented to S. O. Heller- Willensky, Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1994, 195-209 [Hebrew]. According to Jospe, Maimo- nides never accepted Shi'ur Qomah as authentic and worthy of philosophical explication. I will deal with this issue in more detail in my forthcoming article: "Measuring God's Body: From Medieval Jewish Aristotelianism to Spinoza." For now, let me only note that the philosophical premises, on which Ibn Ezra's and Narboni's Shi'ur Qomah inter- pretation is based, can also be found in Maimonides, and are, in addition, used in his explanation of Moses' vision of God's "back" (cf. Exodus 33:23), e. g., in Guide I, 21, which both Ibn Ezra and Narboni link with their Shi'ur Qomah interpretation. 55 Cf.

Of the MSS not containing the passage, one was copied in the 14th century, the other in 1488. 56 From the collation of selected excerpts it became clear that none of the extant MSS is the one Bisliches used for his edition. In addition, B. Richler, the director of the IMHM, drew my attention to the fact that all but two MSS of MYM were in their libraries before 1837, the date of Bisliches' edition. The two MSS are MS Moscow and MS JTS (see the list below). The MS is also not described in Ha-Palit, L. Zunz's catalogue of 80 rare MSS in Bisliches' collection, which Bisliches him- self published in 1850.57 Although a comprehensive examination of the MS tradition is be- yond the scope of the present study, some preliminary observations, as well as tentative conclusions are in order.

Margoliouth 906), the other undated (Vienna Cod. Hebr. 197).61 Both MSS contain medieval philo- sophical texts. Moreover, we learn from two notices of sale that the London MS, at least until 1461, was much more comprehensive than 56 See the description of the manuscripts below. 57 On Bisliches, see the entry in B.

[Kipa 22 || J The variants allow the following tentative conclusions about the MS traditioni (i) MSS HI, as well as J (Bisliches' edition), share a number of sig- nificant variants besides the fact that they lack the newly discovered passage. See in particular the two long additions in line 8 and 19, and the variants in line 3, 7, 14, 17, 19, 20 and 22. The shared characteristics outweigh the differences, and make it reasonable to assume that the two MSS, and the lost MS that Bisliches used, constitute a distinctive branch of the MS tradition. Note that MSS HI were both copied in Sephardic semi-cursive script. (ii) Within the group of MSS containing the passage, MSS ABFG have the exact same text (with the exception of a single variant of MS 81 "Huís;" does appear in the main text, but was erased.</page><page sequence="27">(2004) Samuel ibn Tibbon's Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 109 B in line 14), and can, therefore, be identified as a clearly distinct Italian branch of the MS tradition. (iii) MSS CDE consitute a less homogeneous group. Besides a num- ber of shared variants (see line 7, 11, 14), each MS also has character- istic variants of its own. Note also the two shared variants of MSS DE in line 9 and 19. Finally, this group also has a number of variants in common with MSS HIJ (see the two variants in line 7, and the variant in line 14). In a provisory way this branch of the MS tradition can be described as Italian-Byzantine. Let me point out here that my edition of the passage, based on MSS ABCD, has confirmed the very close relation of MSS A and B, as well as the relatively close relation of MSS C and D. Turning now to the question of the passage's place in MYM 20, I would suggest that its absence in MSS HIJ is not due to an omission. Rather, in my opinion, Ibn Tibbon added the passage when revising an earlier version of MYM. Let me give my reasons for this suggestion: (i) The passage clearly interrupts the exegesis of Psalm 104 with which Ibn Tibbon is concerned in chapter 20. He himself draws attention to this fact when, at the end, he declares he is returning to where he left off at the passage's beginning ("131? tZHD1? IKWan EHD1? irnipn *?X 3W31 möTön lü" 353-354). In terms of content the passage does not contri- bute to the chapter's subject matter, so that its absence in MSS HIJ does not affect the intelligibility of the chapter. Moreover, the aggressive-po- lemical style clearly distinguishes it from the style of the rest of MYM. (ii) In most MSS containing the passage, it is preceded by the words "nüiy 1ÖNJ" (1 1), which do not make sense in this context. The reference to the beginning of the second verse of Psalm 104 ("na^D T)K WDTO nSPTD D'öiP noia") introduces the exegetical discussion following the passage, and indeed recurs at its end: "Huía nn^BD Tix WTO nttK nSPTO D*»tP" (354). Since two of the three MSS not containing the passage have "Hüls/ 1&amp;K1" (MSS IJ), I would suggest the following ex- planation for the awkward occurrence of the two words: An earlier ver- sion of MYM had the text that we read now in MSS IJ. Instead of rewriting the whole chapter in order to incorporate the passage, Ibn Tibbon only marked the place where it was to be inserted. Although he obviously intended its insertion before "ntny "1ÖX1," copyists at an early stage of the treatise's transmission mistakenly inserted the passage after the two words. What may have contributed to the confusion is the recurrence of the reference to Psalm 104:2 at the end of the passage. Since the two words were now out of context, and in light of the graphic similarity of the letters Waw and Nun the reading "~lEKa" instead of</page><page sequence="28">1 1 0 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 "10K1" can be explained as a simple mistake, and may even reflect an attempt to make sense of the sentence after the misplaced insertion. Note also that the person who erased "Hüiy" in MS E must have been aware of the confusion. Additional differences between the version of the MSS including the passage and the version of the MSS not including it may also be accounted for by assuming that Ibn Tibbon revised the treatise. But even if my assumption is correct, it does not allow the conclusion that MSS HIJ consistently represent an earlier version of MYM. The evidence from a number Ibn Tibbon's works suggests that different textual traditions originating in different versions of a work were combined in the course of the work's transmission. As a conse- quence the text of one MS frequently is composed of elements of differ- ent versions of the same work.82 (iii) The assumption that Ibn Tibbon inserted the passage into an already existing version of MYM would explain, therefore, its absence from one branch of the MS tradition, its independence concerning style and content and the unintelligible reference to Psalm 104:2 preceding it. But it also fits well into what we know about Ibn Tibbon's general work- ing practice, of which we can by now form a quite accurate picture. A substantial amount of evidence shows that Ibn Tibbon continued revis- ing his works over a long period of time, and that these revisions are to a considerable extent responsible for textual differences in the MS tradi- tion of the respective work. This holds true for both Ibn Tibbon's trans- lations and his original works.83 In light of this evidence, the existence of more than one version of MYM would not come as a surprise - in particular since Ibn Tibbon himself draws the reader's attention to his struggle over "twenty years" (MYM 2, 5) with the problem that consti- tutes the treatise's point of departure. 82 On the practice of copyists who "regarded themselves as critical editors, some- times even as redactors," and thus produced "eclectic editions" rather than simple copies, see M. Beit-Arié, "Transmission of Texts by Scribes and Copyists: Unconscious and Critical Interferences," Bulletin of the John Ry lands University Library of Manche- ster 1 '5 / 3 (1993), 33-51 . 83 For a discussion of earlier literature on philological aspects of Ibn Tibbon's works, see Fraenkel, From Maimonides to Samuel ibn Tibbon, chapter 1.2. R. Fontaines' introduction to her edition of Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew translation of Aristotle's Meteor- ology is particularly important in this context. See R. Fontaine, Otot ha-Shamayim: Samuel ibn Tibbon's Hebrew Version of Aristotle's Meteorology, Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1995, IX-LXXIII. I have myself attempted to clarify the complicated history of the preparation of the Hebrew translation of the Guide of the Perplexed and of the com- position of Ibn Tibbon's glossaries of philosophical and scientific terms.

Saul at first appears to support the later date as it reflects the escalating debates which led to the Maimonidean controversy in the early 1230s.85 If, on the other hand, the passage is an addition to an earlier version of MYM as I suggested, the first date would appear more plausible at least for this earlier version. 3. The Edition of the Passage in MYM 20 The separate publication of the passage in MYM 20 is in my view jus- tified for the following reasons: the considerable interest of its content, its independence from the rest of the treatise, and because a critical edition of MYM is not likely to appear any time soon. From the col- lation of a sample of excerpts from the passage, none of the MSS stood out as clearly superior to all the others. Since all MSS contain scribal errors, textual corruptions, as well as omissions due to homoeoteleuton, I decided to edit the passage as an eclectic text. My edition is based MSS ABCD. These are the two earliest MSS of respectively the Italian and the Italian-Byzantine branch of the MS tradition including the passage. MSS FG are very close to MSS AB, and do not contain variants of significance for the establishment of the text. MS E is on the whole of poor quality with a number of variants based on errors or mistaken emendations. As basis for the edition I used MS A which is the earliest MS of MYM, written in a clear Italian square script by a well known scribe who appears to have been specialized on copying medieval philo- sophical texts.86 Although the MS has its defects, it is for the most part reliable, and has the further advantage that the scribe did not attempt to emend textual corruptions on the basis of his own conjectures. In light of the three other MSS, I have corrected the text of MS A in case of scribal errors, textual corruptions and omissions due to homoeoteleu- 84 A. Neubauer, "Zur Abfassungszeit des D'an Vip*1 und des O-'öWn -)VW von Ger- son ben Shlomoh," in: Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 21 (1872), 182-184. 85 Cf. Robinson, Samuel ibn Tibbon, 41. 86 See the description of the MS above and the secondary literature cited there.</page><page sequence="30">1 1 2 Carlos Fraenkel JSQ 1 1 ton. Every deviation from MS A in my edition is supported by at least one MS, and has been documented and explained in a footnote. Although this practice led to a certain overlap between footnotes and critical apparatus, I have adopted it because it allows to easily restitute the version of MS A, and to evaluate the considerations which guided my editorial interventions. On the whole the result in my opinion is a text significantly better and closer to the original than the text of any single MS. The critical apparatus includes all variants except for differ- ences in spelling.

David b. Saul's quotation is, however, inaccurate as Ibn Tibbon himself notes in his discussion of the letter: 'p&gt;tnn ^TUn TDDH Kin DtPH no^D pi ID ny rm*an n-iyan incas na ^"n int3 i^k niyon ino^D y-' n1?** nyi^an 13KXÖ iòtp '»aso Kin niKiatr nn nnxi ini ran 'td1? onnaia -o^ nn noitrsD naitr1? nr inn» Kin 'K-iipn' p&gt;iD3 n1?1»^ [n]30»3 i3Kxatr na d^iki p Kinn löKan n^w vn K1? rrpno ono apa k1?»^ in^Ki ntra na tö»^ nnyaa i^n^a ^»Vk' ;n"i1Kn ^asa -nay1?' (126-132). According to Ibn Tibbon, the literal meaning of this Midrash is that Moses and Elijah could not bear the light of God passing in front of the cave, and in order to protect them God covered the opening through which they had entered. According to David b. Saul's version God entered into the cave but took care not to leave any opening in order to protect his creation which in contrast to the cave could not bear his glory without a 'cloud and mist.' It seems that for David b. Saul there is a link between the cave's special quality and the claim that it belongs to the things that, according to the Midrash, were created before the creation of the world. He appears to suggest that the cave is able to hold God's glory because it is not part of creation itself. Note that also the claim that the creation of the cave preceded the creation of the world has no clear basis in rabbinical literature (see note 103). The function of the cave, according to David b. Saul, seems to be to prevent God's revela- tion without 'cloud and mist' to cause the world's destruction ('D'riyn *7D nDntP'). Since the cave's creation before the creation of the world allows it to fulfill this function it is possible to say that its purpose is the preservation of God's creatures ('Dl"p vmxna'). The addition found in MSS CD (see the variant readings) in my opinion is not part of the original version. It apparently intends to explain the limit of 'the great glory' through the need to protect the creatures. This, however, does not fit with the rest of the sentence, according to which 'DXISM 17133 ny 'T'QO1? nVD3 n'jiD"' r« intPTTp.' If my interpretation is correct, the author of the addition in MSS CD did not understand David b. Saul's claim concerning the cave and concerning the power of God's limited glory. 102 MSS AB: "»aaa.' 103 It is unclear to me to what David b. Saul is referring. In his discussion of this sentence (268 ff.), Ibn Tibbon assumes that the reference is to the temple that belongs to 'the seven things which were created before the creation of the world' (see, e. g., bT Pes 54a). 104 MSS ABC: 'ViiraK,' but further down his name appears as 'TUVSK' (204) in all MSS as it appears here in MS D.</page><page sequence="33">(2004) Samuel ihn Tibbon 's Ma 'amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim 115 i^ki /mnraw n^a insa' [a1* * *7xpTrr] 'laipaa " ma Tna' own hiai1? 1O6i;7 mn k1? 105,[p]naiK onty ias 'm^ya' 'laipaa' [yn]^ n»n 108Kim ,K*nan nsPT nain uaa onrna ontr ïo7pipsn p da .inxa nxn *7sn ^yaa p^awa p^Kn Kin " »a laa1? ^k mawm pvn nrrV n"y Dï?p3iK ia pmnty mawn pwa l09,'^ i pnai] ;&gt;ny i^k nnna ?o /ny n1»1? yn^a nyixa o^tyi x^y^a x^atra n^nrstyi' triipn mia *?Dpn na^naa xinn anan pDioa ^v1? «a ixa iy .pipsn ma ht ira naw nxn nn*o .K*»n ma^nDtr ii*y ^a raav n*ynv na •'D1? mt^iy pnain *?aa xm [n^yjn*» pt^ntzr pirana pnn p^apntr ,1^ •»nnaxtr? - D^aon ^vaia i1? n^n ,ia o^Ksaa oowsa pnn pT^yn *?ai pnn 75 ptrnt^ p"»raxa pntrr piaxa nt ran1? ^am naa ifr *»niaxtr na *?atr m *7a p^^aa pntrr naa rfrvi x^tr ^n^ya ti y p^i p^awa awv [n^yjn^ lax' [pn]aix vn x^ id ixi i;?i»xtr pai1? ^wan xint^ k1? ,iüwdd n"y ^KpTn1»! n^y^i im naia "pan* x1? mn "»vaxa ^a '»ai /p^raxa n1?^ naa *a nsn .D'avm p^atr^a woavi p^at^a atr?v pt^nt^ lana p^iat^ so Kin iK *iia Kin ^la^ V? tr?^ •»a ^ai ^iaa V? tr^ p*»raKa pntr^ pnyia iK ,nüwai ipa monn nv^an Vi ,pnay p^pai pnai ,niDnn ^•»traa ^•»ki .i1?1»«» inK Kin p^sk 11Ol7aAian na^n nt p pki ,niDna mpa k1?! ,nnn n[i]^ana n^an k1?! ^na mpa pt^n lat^n^ pn^y avin Kin Kinn nnm ,pny-ra i1?^ itr^Ka Vaaia n^n^i nn imai^ pi -iKt^a ss ^"i ^t^ai ^tran Kinw [i]an Ptr^n mi v^y nnw *a ^^iki .p^at^a atrrv D*ava Kxaj l^ay1? ^va Kinv n^ya1? mK^av laa p^ava na^vn nKima 111miKi»xa n^ya ^yi iniK^xa ^y niia Yi ,ptrn Vy niiav nav1?

In fact, MS B has the latter verse also here. But in the next sentence Ibn Tibbon again discusses the verse 'D^atPH p "|rQtP Dipaa,' and this time quotes it correctly. 161 See note 160. 162 MSS AB lack "|mw 113a ... vr nai' due to homoeoteleuton.
