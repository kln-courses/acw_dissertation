<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Group of Unique Plaques from Chandraketugarh by Sima Roy Chowdhury An extraordinary group of small plaques from Chandraketugarh (refer to the map on Fig. 1), an early historical site of South Bengal (lat. 22? 42' N &amp; Long. 88? 41' E), represents a lady with her legs sprawled out and drawn up laterally and bent or flexed at the knees. The arms of the female figure are placed near the womb (Fig. 2). In one category of these plaques (Fig. 3) the head of the figurine has been metamorphosed into that resembling a vegetation, and the feet into the hooves of an animal. However, in the other category, the abstraction of the head into a floral or vegetal motif is absent and the figure is represented with a human head (Fig. 2). In both the groups, the hands do not hold on to the stalks of flowers and are depicted resting on the womb, which too is indicated clearly (the skin being almost transparent in appearance). The posture obviously represents a female in the position of giving birth. The birth-giving motif is further reiterated by the depiction of the placenta. These plaques were recovered accidentally from the site. At present they are kept in the Museum of the West Bengal Directorate of Archaeology, Calcutta. Their Accession nos. are 04-450 and 04-11 respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). They are not the only plaques of a similar type and both the categories discussed below have several copies, obviously made from similar moulds. The site was subjected to excavation by the Archaeological Survey of India and the report has been published in Indian Archaeology ? A Review, between the years 1956-57 through to 1966-67. The site has yielded several cultural phases ranging from Mauryan to post-P?la periods, i.e. 3rd/2nd century B.C. to the 10th century A.D. However, the number of terracottas recovered from surface collection far outnumber the excavated material. It is pertinent to note that most of these plaques are tiny (5x4 cm) and are usually provided with small perforations at the top, meant for suspension, either as pendants or as wall-hangings. It is possible that these plaques were meant as charms to be worn or carried by women desiring children or as amulets meant for the protection of one's offspring by those already possessing them. Alternatively, these plaques functioned as cult objects associated with fertility, meant to be hung on the wall. In this connection it would be interesting to refer to an inscription accompanying a fragmentary stone image in a similar posture, from Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh. The Nagarjunakonda image however, does not represent the female with her hands placed near the womb, nor does it depict the placenta emerging from the body. The votive epigraph accompanying the Nagarjunakonda figure, records the donation of a female donor who gave it as a gift for the welfare of her children and husband, who were all alive (Narasirnhaswarni 1952: 137-39). Terracotta and stone representations of female figurines in a similar posture have been frequently found in Indian art and have been variously identified by the scholars. However, in most of the examples discussed by the scholars, the head of the female figurine is represented [1] 293</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Map of West Bengal showing the sites yielding early historical terracottas. 294 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - A terracotta plaque from Chandraketugarh representing a woman in the act of giving birth. Fig. 3 - A terracotta plaque from Chandraketugarh representing a woman with vegetal head and animal feet, in the act of giving birth. as a flower, usually a lotus. Moreover, the figurine is generally depicted holding the stalks of flowers (lotus) in her two upraised hands. Stella Kramrisch (1956) identifies her with Aditi utt?napady the birth-giving mother of all creations, depicted without a face but with an all-pervasive body akin to vegetation and more precisely, to the lotus, the plant which symbolizes life or creativity by its very nature. Aditi is supposed to support all the world and is also all-sustaining. She is the wide one (prthu), the capacious, widely spread, bounteous earth and is actively spreading herself wide giving birth to all that is. Thus according to Stella Kramrisch the world was born of Aditi with her legs spread wide open (utt?napad). Similar images have been variously explained by other scholars. Sankalia (1960; 1978), who initially ascribed it to Roman impact, later (after the Inamgaon excavation) revised his opinion in favour of a chalcolithic origin. Further, he named it Lajj? Gauri, a nomenclature followed by others (Janssen 1993; Bolon 1992). J.N. Banerjea (1956: 489) suggested the association with the vegetation deity ??kambhari&gt; while Sivaramamurti (1982: 23) quotes a passage from the Visnudharmottarapur?na to prove that Laksmi should be drawn with the lotus as her face. The text however, states that a lotus should be placed on the top of the head. Recently, Carol Radcliffe Bolon (1992: 11) has divided the forms of Lajj? Gauri into four categories. Bolon rightly notes that the name and identification of the icon of Lajj? Gauri has been achieved not by reference to a literary text, but through ethnographic studies. It is also true that the name of the deity proliferated and similar icons were given different names in different localities. In Bolon's opinion, the image-type represented a village / tribal goddess [3] 295</page><page sequence="4">associated with fertility rites, which later found its way into the Hindu pantheon, especially with royal patronage, much in the same way as A. Eschmann and H. Kulke envisaged the process of Hinduization of the tribal or village deities in Orissa. The initial form of the icon was a pot, which was elaborated to include legs and arms and a lotus-shaped head. In the last phase, with the addition of the human head, the icon attained its final anthropomorphic form. This final anthropomorphic form, according to Bolon's classification Form IV, predominated in the north (excluding Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, and only one from Orissa) (Bolon 1992: 11-13, 71) and was never found in the south or in the east. The form was moreover, deemed as late, available between 6th and 8th centuries A.D. The present group of plaques (Figs. 2-3) from Chandraketugarh, dated on stylistic grounds, from 1st century B.C. to 2nd century A.D., proves the existence of an anthropomorphic form of the icon at an early date in Bengal. However, it should be remembered that the function of an object of art in stone and terracotta were not necessarily identical. A large stone image of the icon, may be a record of royal patronage of a tribal / village deity (as envisaged by Kulke and Eschmann), while a small terracotta plaque may be a ritual or cult object belonging to an individual. Moreover, attempts to arrive at blanket generalizations (Bolon 1992: 67-71) about the social context in which artistic activity thrives, may prove to be misleading for the Indian society which is heterogenous. The intrinsic qualities of art, may be considered universal to an extent, but an understanding or interpretation of it is inextricably intertwined with local and regional phenomena. Thus the group of tiny terracotta plaques from Chandraketugarh may be considered as forming part of a cult or ritual associated with fertility, but whether they represent a vil? lage / tribal cult or a tribal cult in the process of assimilation into the larger Hindu pantheon, or whether patronization was actively responsible for the process ? are issues difficult to ascertain. My personal opinion would be that these tiny plaques from Chandraketugarh were used as charms or amulets by expectant mothers or those already possessing children. Their very size, their circular shape, and the perforations on the plaques suggest the above assumption. REFERENCES Banerjea, J.N. (1956) The Development of Hindu Iconography. Calcutta.
