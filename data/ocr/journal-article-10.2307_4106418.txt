THE records of philosophy and of science show that the concepts symbolized in the terms "time " and "space " have been the occasion for prolonged speculation and disputation. In the theory of knowledge, in the theory of mechanics, in astronomical observations, and, more recently, in the theory of memory and of evolutionary biology, ideas of time and of space constitute the framework on which the main evidence and arguments are displayed. It is not too much to say that a great deal of con- fusion has arisen from the fact that the hypothetical conceptions of time and space have differed considerably according to the nature of the inquiry pursued and that, while one particular conception might be quite useful in a certain line of investiga- tion, it might be altogether inadequate in another branch of research. As a consequence it is found that the problem of "time" and "space," as such, has been rendered difficult by the custom of approaching it from the point of view of highly complicated representations of the phenomena or order of events to which these terms have reference. Practically no account has been taken of the help which is afforded by the historical method of analysing the complex process through which we have proceeded from one stage in our phylogenetic progress to another, and have thereby come to have ideas of time and space through</page><page sequence="2">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 65 a gradual extension of activity and experience. The difficulty has been aggravated by the assumption, so frequently made, that the terms themselves represent something quite simple: that time is something homogeneous in which events occur, and that space is something homogeneous in which bodies move or are placed. So far from this being the case, the time in which we space our experiences or calculate the order of events is the outcome of processes of mental abstraction representing the highest activities of the human faculty. Through familiarity we take for granted, or pass over, the complicated conditions which underlie "time." So, also, is it with regard to space. We take it for granted, because we are accustomed to move freely and to explore our surroundings with our hands and eyes, and it never occurs to us that the space which we know, and which is geometrically related to the objects which we touch and see is, in thought, a highly complicated abstraction of pro- longed phylogenetic experience. There can be little doubt but that our completed representa- tions of time and space have their origin in processes of which counting is an abstraction; that is to say, the origin of these representations is to be found in the recognition of objects which were similar and simultaneous on the one hand, and which, on the other hand, could be combined or abstracted into a single whole by successive enumeration. Thus, in the case of the five fingers, they could be recognized as similar in space and counted as five in time. Such simple processes, in all probability, con- stitute the basis of measurement on which the orderly regulation of experience and scientific abstraction of thought depend. But the discovery of counting, while initiating the most important epoch in animal evolution, depended upon attainments which had already reached a high degree of perfection in animal behaviour. The elements in behaviour from which original counting was an abstraction comprised the reactions which were E</page><page sequence="3">66 IVY MACKENZIE, essential to the animal world in its adaptation to environment. Counting pre-supposes a certain activity of thought involving the recognition of spatial and temporal relations, but the doing of space and of time over long ages was the condition antecedent to the abstractions of thought in measurement which gave primitive man an advantage in the struggle for existence. There must always be something arbitrary, or even contra- dictory, about speculation as to the origin of life and of that manifestation of life which is termed consciousness. We imagine that life must have begun somehow, at some time and in some place; but it can have begun only in conditions in which it was implicit. The same holds good with regard to consciousness or awareness, which must be inherent in the nature of things, although it exists, as we know it, only in a form of experience peculiar to the human faculty. It has been argued with some plausibility that where there is life there must be consciousness, that both in plant and simple animal life there must be the rudiments of primitive manifestations of that which afterwards constitutes "awareness " in the human mind. On the other hand, there are those who, with a greater show of reason, would confine consciousness to the animal world, and in so doing would relate its origin and development to the appearance and evolution of organic motility, associated with sensori-motor reactions, and commencing even in those humble forms of animal life where such reactions are not yet subserved by a nervous system. The main obstacle to the acceptance of either of these propo- sitions is that they imply the possibility of attributing conscious- ness -to inorganic as well as to organic nature. There is no definite reason for believing that organic and inorganic nature are two absolutely distinct and unrelated forms of existence. The history of physiology is very largely the history of attempts to explain the organic in terms of inorganic reactions, but, as Haldane suggests, it may quite well be that inorganic reactions</page><page sequence="4">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 67 may be ultimately explicable only from the point of view of organic phenomena. The metaphysical difficulties which naturally arise in such problems may be minimized in this particular instance by adopting a definite biological point of view. It is consequently assumed that ideas or feelings of space and time have their origin in a long history of animal life in which the co-ordinate doing of space and time were indispensable conditions. Such doing of space and time is to be regarded as the condition of a special kind of movement, movement that may be characterized as organismal locomotion, and distinguishable from movements in plants, movements associated with inorganic terrestrial changes, or movements in celestial mechanics. Having thus narrowed down the outlook, the question now arises in what manner and at which stage in animal evolution the doing of time and space is supplemented by correlated feelings and ideas. Movement from one place to another is of the very essence of animal behaviour in all its forms, but it seems reason- able to suppose that it was only at an advanced period that that movement became associated with and influenced by those conditions which we include in the term " awareness." Let us consider shortly some of the conditions implied in the various stages through which animals have slowly evolved in the course of attaining a wider field of movement and more elaborate mode of action. There are certain features which are common to all animal organisms independently of the place they may occupy in the phylogenetic series :--() Each organism retains, in virtue of a system of internal regulation, a uniformity of structure and function which, for the stage of its growth, is characteristic for the species ; (2) this independence is con- sistent with the most intimate relations of a mutual character with its environment; (3) the preservation of its identity and environmental relations are consistent with a characteristic process E2</page><page sequence="5">68 IVY MACKENZIE. of growth over an average period of existence, and with the reproduction of organisms of its own kind, with corresponding features and a corresponding life history. Each organism thus has, at any particular moment, a place in its own immediate environment, a place in the history of its own development and in the preservation of the species to which it belongs, as well as a place in the great phylogenetic tree of animal life of which it constitutes a living unit. The simplest unicellular organism retains its individual features while preserving an intimate relationship with the fluid medium from which it draws its sustenance. The envelope by which it is surrounded is the only place of contact with the outside world. It is the region on which stimuli impinge and through which nutritive substances enter and the by-products of metabolism leave the organism. Here appropriate selection takes place in accordance with the requirements of the individual, and the response in the form of self-preservation, movement and repro- duction are dictated by a system of internal regulation. It is, of course, obvious that the characteristic features of identity and behaviour can be preserved only if the properties of the medium be within average limits. Recent research has shown how highly refined and how extremely complicated are the processes which determine the behaviour of these apparently simple masses of protoplasm which live and move and have their being in immediate contact with environment. An outstanding feature of animal life from the phylogenetic point of view is the tendency, through differentiation, to seek a wider range of activity, and so to increase the opportunities of finding food and of escaping danger. Sensori-motor reaction becomes more complicated; a greater variety of stimuli are selected by special sense organs which supplement the tactual functions of the skin or cuticle, and on the motor side there is a corresponding elaboration of the apparatus which provides for</page><page sequence="6">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 69 movement from place to place. However specialized the sensory system becomes, it preserves, just as does the cuticle of the simplest animal, an immediate relationship between the organism and its environment, and the movement which its excitation evokes is an adaptive response to the character and origin of the stimulus. The visual apparatus brings the organism into touch with objects at a distance and the expansion of the horizon from which stimuli may originate is a measure of the distance which may be traversed for food or for safety. The eyes, the ears, and the nose provide, in the case of higher animals, an incentive and guide for an increasing variety of movements and behaviour over a wide area of environment, while the skin and its specialized appendages afford the means of selecting appropriate stimuli from immediate surroundings. Optic stimuli are also concerned in the co-ordinate adjustment of movements of different parts of the body which combine in orderly locomotion. In these adaptive reactions within the body itself there participate, also, stimuli from the otic labyrinth and from the skin, joints and muscles. There are thus two aspects to the movements which are characteristic for animal activity; there is that aspect which is related to the external world and influenced by the state of the world through the organs of external sense; and there is the other aspect which is more immediately related to conditions in the organism itself and to stimulation by movement of special sensory terminals in the internal ear, in the skin, muscles and joints. It should be noted, however, that- optic stimuli are a common factor to each of those aspects, and that the distance- receptors of vision preserve an intimacy between the remote objects of the external world and the organism and, at the same time, play a part, along with the otic labyrinth, etc., in determining the co-ordination of motor response to distant stimulation.</page><page sequence="7">70 IVY MACKENZIE. There is, however, a third aspect to co-ordinate movement which cannot be left out of account. The motor reaction to a stimulus cannot be explained simply on the conditions present at the time of movement or, at any rate, the conditions are in no way comparable with those in an artificial mechanism. The conditions of movement, so far from being mechanical, are always in a process of " becoming." They are, at any particular moment, the expression of conditions which have been operative, not only throughout the previous existence of the particular animal, but throughout the whole series of phylogenetic processes in the direct line of succession from the stage of its most primitive ancestor. Effacement and accession of structure and function may have produced modification of movement or reaction in particular stages of the phylogenetic succession, but the poten- tialities for activity at any given moment in the life of an animal depend on the balance to account that has been preserved through time by organic memory. Experience in duration has been duly registered on the organic scroll of its own life and on that of its ancestors, and reactions in terms of that experience may be represented at any moment in the course of its activities. Let us now consider the significance of these observations regarding our contention that .the doing of space and time is a process in animal life antecedent to and conditional for those forms of experience in which ideas and feelings of space and time play a part. The preservation of certain temporal and spatial relations is a condition necessary for the normal move- ments of all animals, including man. Adaptive spatial and tem- poral relations are manifested in the two main categories of movement,-(1) in the movements which, in combination, give the body its characteristic motility, and (2) in the movements which secure an orderly adjustment to environment. Sherrington has pointed out in his work on the Integrative Action of the Nervous System how co-ordinate motor response depends on the</page><page sequence="8">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 71 selection of reflexes which, in their spatial and temporal relations, combine to produce an orderly sequence of events; and this orderly sequence of events applies, not only to the grouping of muscles in relation to each other, but also to the ultimate effect in the natural response of the organism as a whole to environ- mental stimuli. Now all animal movement may be traced ultimately to the rhythmic contractions of the primitive unicellular organism. Its displacement by contraction is the first doing of space, and the " refractory period " which regulates the rhythmic change is the first doing of time. Sentient nature begins with a sense of the world limited to impressions received by a simple cuticle from the adequate stimuli in the fluid by which it is immediately surrounded. While it preserves its identity and transmits its features, the protozoal unit maintains an intimate connexion with the rest of nature in terms of limited mutual exchange. In some mysterious way it conserves in its duration the experi- ences of the past and harbours the potentialities of the future. It should be noted that while the doing of environmental space involves a subservience to temporal conditions, the doing of time is only partly reflected in locomotion. Stimuli selected by receptive adaptation may be conserved for the time being and released only on the subsequent occurrence of appropriate stimulation, although, of course, the conditions for release may never materialize. The organism in its process of " becoming " is at any particular moment at a point of conflux between a past which it has conserved, both individually and phylogenetic- ally, and a future which will be realized both in an individual and in a phylogenetic sense. In this provision for the future in terms of the past there is something which disengages the organism from the ligation of the present. An everyday example of the same process on a limited scale is seen in the growth of the pregnant uterus whose gradually increasing muscular tissue</page><page sequence="9">72 IVY MACKENZIE. performs its contractile function only after a considerable period and when the conditions which determine its contractile reaction come into play. Underlying these concatenations of events, in which a distinction between past and future is merely arbitrary, is the process of duration or of organic time, a process which can be most adequately conceived as an expression of design. During the ascent of the evolutionary scale the interaction of the organism with its environment becomes more extensive without losing any of its intimacy. Tactual stimuli continue to play an important part in provoking reaction, but stimuli from a distance become an increasingly important factor in determining movement to a distance. The doing of space and of time becomes more complicated. The variety of adequate stimuli from environment increases with a greater differentiation of receptor organs and surfaces. A corresponding differentiation and refinement of the locomotor apparatus ensures a wider range of movement and a more rapid articulation in reaction. The ever-changing scene of surrounding nature becomes more fully represented on the sensory side of the organism, so that the struggle for existence on the motor side is pursued with greater chances of success. A more varied and more intimate experience of the world is gradually incorporated in the life of the organism in the process of duration. We have no means of knowing how a dog looks at the world. To deny it intelligence, or even understanding, would be tanta- mount to a confession that one had never lived with dogs. In respect of intelligence one dog differs from another, and one breed may surpass another. Capacity for training in tricks is not so remarkable as the exquisite adaptation to the environment for which a particular breed may be specially suited. A wide range of vision, a keen sense of smell, and ability to interpret the meaning of simple sounds, bring within the ambit of its experience a world of multiple interests. Diversity of emotional</page><page sequence="10">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 73 reaction, submission to discipline, and inhibition of impulse are features of behaviour which, while developed by domestic associa- tion, suggest an inherent relation to human conduct. But in spite of all this we cannot conceive what the world looks like to the dog. That there is some form of consciousness, there can be no doubt. There is evidence of memory and of anticipation, of that sense of continuity in the succession of events which is suggestive of the feeling of time. But, after all, it moves in a small world in which its behaviour is largely pre- determined by a hereditary capacity for doing time and for doing space. We are apt to exaggerate its performances because we are surprised at the efficiency of its automatic responses. There has accrued to it from a long ancestry in the animal scale a legacy of temporo-spatial potentialities which, when realized, enable it to behave with characteristic perfection in a small world of its own. That world is represented in and con- structed out of a small brain. It is a brain with few problems in the human sense. The struggle for existence is pursued on the whole after a manner dictated by the impulse of the grosser emotions, and the fable of the bone mirrored in the water affords a measure of canine capacity for indeterminate conduct. Of the innumerable streams of thought originating in the Darwinian hypothesis, one of the most popular has been the speculation as to the relation of man to the rest of sentient nature. The theological prepossessions of the earlier period of modern philosophy assigned to man a special sphere in the scheme of things. The features which distinguished him from his pro- genitors in the animal scale were emphasized in such a way as to suggest that he had an independent and special origin in creation. The reaction to this attitude is seen in a swing of the pendulum to the opposite extreme where the features which man exhibits in common with the rest of the animal world have been portrayed in such a way as practically to leave out of account</page><page sequence="11">74 IVY MACKENZIE. the distinguishing characteristics which give him his predominant position. It is quite obvious that among his original endowments man possesses in an exquisite degree the capacity for doing space and time. His articulate movements in space are more intricate and more variedly adaptive than those of any of his phylogenetic antecedents or contemporaries in the animal world. If he has not the vision of the eagle or the olfactory sense of the dog, the products of his sensations are combined in such a way as to bring him into a more comprehensive relationship with the rest of nature, and so contribute to the foundation of a knowledge on which depends the conquest of himself and of his environment. Among all the members of the animal kingdom he has inherited the largest legacy from the past. " Cephalization " is the term employed by Gaskell to designate the gradual concentra- tion in the brain of the neural phenomena which exercise a determining influence on the sensory and motor reactions of the organism as a whole. No animal is to be compared with man in the extent to which, through organic time, the experience of the past is represented in the present. He is not the only animal with a neopallium, but if the degree of expansion of the neopallium be, as there is reason to believe it is, an index of organic superiority, then he is incomparably the highest product of animal creation. He retains the capacity for doing time and for doing space possessed by his phylogenetic ancestry and, in addition, he has shown in his history the evidence of an ability to rise to higher levels in which ideas and feelings of time and space play a leading role. It has been suggested already that a critical stage in animal evolution was reached when the discovery of numbers or of counting was made. The discovery could have been made only if there already existed a certain degree of refinement in the temporal and spatial relations between the organism and environ-</page><page sequence="12">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 75 ment. It pre-supposes, also, an externalization of the outside world as a result of experience, and such externalization carries with it the implication of a certain degree of subjective indepen- dence on the part of the organism. It might be helpful to con- sider how this has come about. However organic life, as we know it, may have come into existence, it is accepted that once the organism has been estab- lished as a living being it is subject to a system of internal regula- tion through which are preserved its identity and characteristic behaviour. Its contact with the external world is, to begin with, strictly limited. As it rises in the animal scale it moves further and reacts to stimuli at a greater distance; in other words it extends its communion with the outside world by means of organic penetration of both a sensory and motor character. Its special sensory organs and nervous system are so arranged as to give it a definitely geometric attitude to its surroundings, an attitude which is only modified in the rhythm of locomotion. In the higher branches of the vertebrate phylum stereoscopic vision, neuro-muscular arrangements for conjugate deviation of the eyes, and correlated movements of the head on the trunk, together with bilateral organs of equilibration adjusted to three dimensions, all in an organism of bilateral symmetry, combine to give the animal a position and posture geometrically related to the world which it explores through its senses and apparatus for movement. But man has isolated himself and externalized the world more completely than any of his progenitors. He has done so after a manner peculiar to his own experience and behaviour. Counting or the invention of numbers is only one of the con- ditions incident to the development of the human microcosm within the macrocosm. The assumption of the erect posture freed the fore-limbs from locomotion, and the hands became instruments for refined sensory discrimination and, in conjunction</page><page sequence="13">76 IVY MACKENZIE. with the eyes, facilitated a more elaborate inspection of environ- ment and a more extensive and refined manipulation of its con- tents. The manufacture of tools was the natural sequence, and in this way was introduced a medium calculated to supplement and extend the means of sustenance and protection. Evolution of the face and larynx prepared the way for the differentiation of a mechanism of speech, and primitive chatter in the comparison of experiences was, no doubt, of use in crystallizing notions about the world and the methods of combating dangers which it har- boured. At this stage primitive man, in virtue of his inherited capacity for doing space and time, and organically so constructed as to do space in a geometrical fashion, is, by reason of his capacity to count, to use his hands, and to engage in conversation, capable of creating, by a process of abstraction and conscious attention, a world of his own. This world is, no doubt, to commence with, quite insignificant; its character and extent are proportionate to his capacity to create. In the records of the earliest civilizations there is evidence that this creative power had already reached an advanced stage. Counting had developed into systems of measurement by which fields were laid out, irrigation planned and houses constructed and arranged in order. Thought, which had become symbolized in vocal expression, found further symbolic expression in marks on stone and tablets. Expressions of the social instinct were regularized in the light of these attainments, and the events of human experience were marked off on an astronomical scale of time, based on a recognition of the regularity of movement of heavenly bodies across the sky. Apprehension and curiosity are general terms which suggest the feelings aroused through interaction with the outside world. They are allied to the feelings of hunger and thirst which are associated with the instincts to eat and drink, but they are more</page><page sequence="14">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 77 intimately related to that product of the creative imagination realized in the more or less orderly views which man had of his surroundings in the early stages of civilization. Disease and death, the perils of the chase and conflict with enemies, thunder and lightning and meteors, were among the incidents which demanded an explanation, and the response to this demand is to be found partly, at least, in the theory and practice of astrology. Out of astrology grew astronomy with its still more insistent demand for a rational explanation of the universe, and involving on the surface, at any rate, a more complete isolation of man on the one side from the extended world of his creative experience on the other. The cosmogonies of ancient civilization and the modern astronomical conceptions of the universe represent phases through which the human mind has passed in its attempts to create an adjustment between current thought and the data of observation in one particular field. The evolution or varia- tion of cosmological theory shows how such theory must fall in with the general prepossessions of the period in which it prevails. Ancient cosmogony was rendered obsolete by the system of Ptolemy, while the discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton and Einstein, involved successive cataclysms in thought, each of which was followed by a new orientation to the physical world of reality. While it prevailed, each of these conceptions was accepted as an absolutely reliable representation of celestial phenomena, constructed by the exact measurement of motion in terms of time and space, the product of geometry and mathe- matics, the only true sciences. Time and space were regarded as absolute ; to regard them as such was necessary for the purposes of the construction. No regard was paid to the fact that the conception of absolute time and space was itself an abstract notion derived, in the first instance, from the simpler expedients of measuring by arbitrary standards at a period when the creative faculties of primitive man began to assert themselves. The</page><page sequence="15">78 IVY MACKENZIE. concept of absolute time is derived, moreover, from the concept of space because we have no means of measuring abstract time except those in which it can be expressed in terms of spatial relations. The characteristic feature of modern philosophy is that it has raised the blunt question as to the validity of what we know. Doubt is the inspiring emotion of the Cartesian teaching, and while Descartes himself propounded theories which offered an explanation of inanimate and animate nature on a mechanical basis, the underlying principle of his philosophy is summed up in his " cogito ergo sum." In this famous formula he indicated what he conceived to be the fundamental starting-point for those whose business it is in life to search after truth. He recog- nized that the path of knowledge was strewn with delusions and that it was a sacred duty to proceed in the spirit of doubt. Authority might be mistaken, the senses might deceive, and the understanding might mislead; but there was one incontrovertible fact, namely, that consciousness exists. Here, at any rate, was something that was real; thoughts might be elusive but as to the reality of their existence there could be no doubt. The subjective attributes of any object of thought are the elements cf its reality. We bring to the interpretation of the external world those contents of our consciousness which give the world the qualities by which it is recognized. We are enabled to react normally to environment in so far as that environment is invested with the normal forms of our consciousness. The Cartesian philosophy reflected thought at every point of contact with the problems of life. There was no great problem, from celestial mechanics to the human soul, which did not come within the ambit of its influence. This is not the place in which to suggest a point of view from which the apparent contradictions between its mechanistic and idealistic aspects may be reconciled. It absorbed and reproduced in an original form the spirit of the</page><page sequence="16">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 79 age and stands in relation to the two main currents of European thought which it inspired. One stream may be taken as repre- sented in the reflections of Berkeley and Hume, the other in the immortal discoveries of Newton. Of primary importance for Berkeley was the nature of the process involved in the acquiring of knowledge. To him, what is regarded as external reality can have no conceivable existence beyond the circle of consciousness. He rejected the external reality of space and recognized it as being exclusively the subjective product of sensations of sight, touch and movement. Newton, on the other hand, accepted as a hypothesis the reality of the external world and proceeded by experiment and by the application of mathematical and geo- metrical principles to formulate a rational conception of mechanics and of a mechanical universe. For Berkeley time, space and motion are relative and referable only to subjective experience, for Newton time and space are, of necessity, absolute. The contrast between these views may be exemplified by reference to what has been said already in regard to the phylo- genetic origin of time and space. To the unicellular organism the external world of reality is in immediate relation to the cuticle by which it is surrounded. As the sensori-motor system becomes more highly differentiated the external world is gradually projected to a distance, relative in one aspect, at least, to the capacity for vision. Man arrives on the scene of a territory already largely explored by the adaptive reactions of his phylo- genetic ancestors in their temporal and spatial relations to environment. He adds to his adaptive capacity which has a certain geometrical basis, by creating tools and numbers and symbols of thought. These inventions give economy and pre- cision to his mode of behaviour, and he is enabled to form notions of the way in which his actions are related to environment. His instruments or constructions are utilized for projecting to a greater distance his sphere of interest and influence, and ultimately</page><page sequence="17">80 IVY MACKENZIE. by the aid of telescopes and spectroscopes he brings himself into contact with a universe far beyond the range of the naked eye. This is the universe which interests Newton; but he accepts it as a problem for the extension of knowledge without asking how the mighty macrocosm has come to be related to the limited consciousness of man. He applies the abstractions and symbols of geometry and mathematics to movements in terms of time and space without considering the relation of these to subjective experience. For him the external world of vision exists by its own right, and over against it he stands deciphering by his masterful genius the laws which govern its existence. Berkeley, on the other hand, questions the validity of the hypothesis of independent externality related to absolute time and absolute space. " Absolute space," he says, "is infinite, immobile, indivisible, not perceivable by the senses, unrelated to anything, without distinction between its parts. Thus its attributes are negative; it is mere nothing. And what kind of space is it that cannot be divided and which we cannot imagine ? " For him time and space are relative. Matter and motion are known to us only as forms of consciousness; the essence of their being is to be conceived or known; and the existence of a state of con- sciousness apart from a thinking mind is a contradiction in terms. Visual consciousness, for example, is merely a system of arbitrary signs which symbolize for us certain actual or potentially tactual experiences. These two streams of thought become confluent in the great synthetic brain of Kant. He gathered up in one system what his predecessors had to offer. While he was much impressed by the discoveries of Newton, was a mathematician himself and believed in a mechanical idea of the universe, the mainspring of his philosophic thought is to be traced to the influence of Hume. He believed with Newton that space must be regarded for practical purposes as enveloping everything; but it has no</page><page sequence="18">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 81 objective existence and is merely a form of our contemplation. His general argument as to space and time is that they are forms which objects must take on as objects of perception to us. The Kantian synthesis has exercised a profound influence on all succeeding speculation. But the nineteenth century has witnessed an even more complete divorce of the subjective and objective attitudes to knowledge than that which followed the Cartesian philosophy. This is to be attributed to the enormous advance in the physical sciences which gave a certain prestige to the mechanistic hypothesis. But the most dramatic influence on the thought of that late period came from the doctrine of evolutionary biology as propounded by Darwin and his followers. While it was no part of the original teaching to explain the phenomena of life from a mechanistic standpoint, yet the main trend of biological investigation, and especially of experimental biology, has been along the lines suggested by Descartes in his interpretation of animals as automatic machines. There can be no question as to the enormous importance of the advances that have been made on this hypothesis. Even those who do not believe that vital reactions can ever be fully explained in terms of physics and chemistry are fully alive to the value of the discoveries which have been made from a mechanistic point of view. But that such a point of view is not indispensable, even in experi- mental physiology, is proved by the far-reaching researches of Haldane who never forgets that if we want to know where we stand with regard to our knowledge we must go back to Hume and to Kant. Modern biology, however, is dominated by prepossessions which are comparable with the absolute time and absolute space of Newton. But even in mechanics and in astronomy the hypothesis of absolute time and absolute space no longer holds undisputed sway. Mach, in his anti-metaphysical Analysis of the Sensations, puts time and space in the same category with F</page><page sequence="19">82 IVY MACKENZIE. sounds, coloui and pressure, and in a series of illuminating observations shows how our spatial presentations are related to the physiological reactions of our organism. Mach is in the direct line of succession of those whose observations have culminated in the theory of Einstein, who says of him, " Appar- ently Mach would have arrived at the theory of relativity if, at the time when his mind still had the freshness of youth, the question of the constancy of the velocity of light had already engaged the attention of the physicists." The theory of relativity destroys the dogma of the independence of an absolute time and absolute space, and puts in its place the conception of a relative space-time system in which time is included in space as a fourth dimension. The new theory reverses the materialistic outlook on the universe. "For it mathematics does not take its subject matter from physics, but gives to physics the data of all science. The objects of physical science are mathematical constructions. They are not self-revealing objects which we find, they are objects which we have ourselves fashioned out of the events which we co-ordinate."* (Wildon Carr.) The validity of the Einstein hypo- thesis is to be found in the more complete conceptions which it offers of the nature of the universe, in the explanation it affords of certain discrepancies in the phenomena of celestial mechanics observed from the Newtonian standpoint, and in its conformity with the theory of electro-magnetic propagations. Its importance from a psychological point of view consists in the fact that, contrary to the notion of classical mechanics, according to which all differences in the appearance of events to observers may be calculated in terms of constant time and space and a variable velocity, there is no distance in space and no interval of time which is invariable and independent of the system of relative movement to which the observer is attached. It is a striking * Italics mine.</page><page sequence="20">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 83 substantiation of the views of Berkeley and confirms the philo- sophical reflections of Goethe that "all natural philosophy is, in the last resort, only anthropomorphism. We can at will observe nature, measure, calculate, and ponder it, but it always remains our impression, our world. Man always remains the measure of things." The question now arises as to how far these reflections on the nature of astronomical time throw any light on the feeling of time or sense of continuity in our own experience. Astronomical time originated in convention, can be described and measured only in terms of space, and in its symbolic application in mechanics and astronomy is merely relative. According to the Einstein theory there is no space in the meaning of the old infinite void and no time in the meaning of the old time-order in which all events are fixed in a definite relation of past, present and future. Our consciousness of such time is the result of abstraction and of the employment of arbitrary signs and symbols in an endeavour to interpret the phenomena of an extended universe which has been projected by prolonged phylogenetic experience. We are conscious, however, of another kind of time, a time which is ceaseless in its mgvement and irreversible in its direction; it is related to the progressive movements of our growth and to the correlated changes in our experience; it is of the nature of something that is part and parcel of our existence as living beings ; it is in the memory of the past, in the perception of the present, and will be continued naturally into the future. To time in this sense Bergson applies the term "duration." There is something elusive about it and we may wonder whether, after all, it may not be an illusion. At any rate it is difficult at first sight to see how it can be an integral factor in our organic reaction and conduct. It frequently happens, however, that nature reveals the laws of her being more clearly in her perturbations than in the even F2</page><page sequence="21">84 IVY MACKENZIE. course of her way. The phenomena of disease have often pro- vided the clue to the rational interpretation of physiological processes. So it is with the problem of the time which we feel; in cases in which time goes wrong we are provided with the evidence on which we can appraise its significance in normal life. A young woman of 25 years awoke one morning in Glasgow and felt she ought to get out of bed and prepare to go to school at Arbroath. Through a state which, for purposes of description, may be termed a " loss of memory for the preceding nine years " she imagined she was still a schoolgirl of 16 years and living with her parents in Arbroath. At the time of this incident she had spent the night with her cousins, sleeping in the room she usually occupied when staying with them. When she awoke she did not recognize the room nor did she recognize one of her cousins who brought her a cup of tea. She appreciated that something was wrong, but did not feel ill and betrayed to her friends no evidence of disorder apart from the fact that she did not know them or her surroundings, and that her memory for events in the interval of nine years had completely disappeared. About six years previous to this time her parents had died and she had come to Glasgow. She was engaged in secretarial work in a legal office and she lived in her own flat in the West-end of the city. She had, however, no recollection of the flat or of her work. She was taken into town by one of her cousins but she failed to recognize the streets; neither did she recognize her office nor her employer, and when taken to the flat she did not feel that she had ever been there before. Every effort on the part of her friends to restore the lost memories proved unavailing. I saw her on the following morning when, to all intents and purposes, she appeared to be normal except for the fact that a period of nine years had disappeared from her experience. There was no evidence of somatic disturbance ; she had slept well during the night and had a clear recollection of her experiences of the</page><page sequence="22">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 85 previous day. She remembered that she had been in town, in her office, had seen her employer and had been taken to her flat, but her recollection of these facts had not, in any way, affected the loss of memory she had sustained. The gulf of nine years was still unbridged, and although she accepted as true the state- ments that her parents were dead, that she had been working in the office which she had seen the previous day, and that the flat she had visited was her own, she did not realize any of these things. She could play the music which she had practised before she was 16, but she could not do shorthand or typewriting which she had learned in the interval. She had absolutely no recollection of the events of the Great War and did not realize that there had been a war. Every effort on this date to restore the current of her experience proved fruitless. The mention of well-known places and persons and of sensational incidents in the War evoked no effective response, and her attempts to transcribe dictation into shorthand were ineffective. She was a strong, healthy-looking woman, quite calm and composed though somewhat indifferent and apathetic considering the circumstances. Her expression was clear and intelligent; she did not look like the average victim of pathological amnesia and, apart from the loss of memory, there was no evidence of the classical signs of hysteria. There was no previous disorder of health which could be associated with the present phase. The only conditions which could be held to account for the disturbance were that on the day prior to the appearance of the amnesia she had had some anxiety about the means of returning to Glasgow from Arbroath on account of a railway strike and that, at the same time, she was in the prodromal stage of an attack of German measles which developed a few days later. I did not see her again for ten days when she had recovered from the measles. There was no recognizable change in her condition. She had a normal recollection of the events of her life</page><page sequence="23">86 IVY MACKENZIE. up till 16 years, as well as for the events which had occurred since the morning when she awoke with the loss of memory, but of the interval she was still oblivious. She had been attempt- ing herself, with the assistance of her friends, to restore the for- gotten memories, but with no success. After using various devices I resolved to try her again with her shorthand. Having provided herself with paper and pencil I mentioned abruptly the name of a well-known legal firm in the city. Her face lit up immediately and she said, "I know that firm; they are in . . Street." I asked her to picture the street in her mind and to follow it down to the next street. She did so and immediately remarked, "I used to work in the firm . . . on the opposite side of the street. Oh, yes, you go down the street to Renfield Street." She then began to name various shops and what she had bought in one shop and in another. She went from one street into another recalling her experiences with a wealth of detail which was marvellous. She was now in a state of mild exaltation, and though perfectly coherent and rational, the rapidity and accuracy of the recurrence of memory suggested that its restoration was under the influence of some automatic process. As a result of this reaction the memories of a period of about two years were partially restored. These were in the early part of the war, but of the war itself she had as yet no idea beyond a hazy recollection that one of her employers had been called up. She had no recollection of the death of her parents and did not yet recognize her office, her employer, her colleagues or her flat. She did not recognize her cousins, except in the light of the acquaintance that had been formed in the previous few days. While perfectly able to form new memories the interval of nine years was still a blank except for the partial redintegration of the period referred to. I saw her again a week later, and during this week she had made no progress. She did not exhibit the liveli-</page><page sequence="24">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 87 ness of interest or will-power necessary to enable her to help herself. I resolved on this occasion to employ the incidents of the War in the test to revive her memory. After several futile trials I mentioned the word "Petrograd." " Oh, yes," she said, "that is in Russia, Mrs. ... lived there and came home to Arbroath after the Revolution." A process similar to that observed on the previous occasion was set in operation. She recalled with amazing rapidity and detail the names of famous Russian generals, the incidents relative to the Russian defection, the names of the notorious revolutionaries and the stories which were associated with their names. In this way was restored another group of experiences limited to a certain proportion over a restricted period. During the process she betrayed the same transient exaltation of emotion accompanying what appeared to be an automatic restoration in extravagant detail. Following these two partially successful attempts to restore the lost continuity of experience there occurred from time to time little incidents which activated a new centre of association from which there spread, as on the previous occasions, a further process of redintegration. One of these is worthy of notice inasmuch as it exhibits the intimate relation of memory to emotional reaction. About three weeks after the onset of her illness she visited her flat, which she had not yet recognized as her own; in her bedroom "something about the wardrobe" struck her as familiar. She left the room and returned when, suddenly, she recognized it as belonging originally to her old home at Arbroath. This set up a revival of memories related to her parents and to the time she lived with them prior to coming to Glasgow. She remembered about their death, the selling of the house, and the setting up of the flat in Glasgow. She immediately saw all the furniture in a new light and the flat seemed to become all at once quite different. I asked her, when she related the incident, in what this difference consisted.</page><page sequence="25">88 IVY MACKENZIE. She thought for a moment, and then replied, " I believed you all when you told me it was my flat, but now I know that it is my flat," with particular emphasis on the " my." The process of restitution proceeded apace. New areas of the amnesic field were gradually restored. She recognized her office and her employer, and was soon able once more to undertake her secretarial work. But even after three months the process was not yet complete. Now, however, her interest was concen- trated, not on the experiences which had returned, but on the isolated patches which were still in oblivion. To these she directed her attention during the quiet of the Sunday afternoons, and in the course of five months the breach of continuity was completely spanned. I saw her at this time when she looked alert and vigorous, was animated in conversation and deliberate in those actions and attitudes which are indicative of character. The apathy and indifference which she exhibited when I saw her first had disappeared completely. This is a somewhat rare form of amnesia; it is none the less suggestive on this account. It occurred in a healthy woman who had no previous history of nervous disease and who, at the time, showed no other signs of nervous instability. There was no exciting cause such as severe physical or psychic trauma. The only abnormal conditions associated with the onset were anxiety, thought of difficulty in railway transport, and infection by a virus which is not recognized as having any special affinity for nervous structures. The amnesia, itself, was of an unusual character. It repre- sented a loss in memory for experiences extending over a period of nine years. Consciousness of the events integrated by time during this period had gone. But there was no interference with the capacity for memorizing new experiences. Perception appeared to be clear. She had no difficulty in remembering what she was told about the events that were lost to her. She</page><page sequence="26">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 89 was able to acquire afresh an acquaintance with her cousins, a knowledge of her flat, of her office and of the streets which she had once known but had forgotten. But that new knowledge while it remained under the cloud of the amnesia lacked some- thing; it lacked the vitalizing influence of integration with the period of her life out of which it had grown. The effect of the loss was exhibited in a certain apathy and indifference which was recognizable to advantage only after she had become her normal self through the process of redintegration. It was in the process of redintegration that the significance for the personality of the loss and recovery of memory was revealed. (1) The first successful attempts to restore the lost time were accompanied by automatic processes of memory, so rapid and detailed as to be quite out of alignment with the average possibilities of psycho-motor reaction, except in the matter of talk; that is to say, if her general behaviour had been in proportion to her flight of ideas she would have been in a state of maniacal excitement. (2) The reaction evoked by a recognition of her possessions and their associations showed how the know- ledge of her flat acquired during the amnesic period required the emotional stimulus from a continuity of experience to give it its proper place in her personality. Through the influence of emotion the flat was once more part of her real live self. (3) So long as the amnesia covered the whole period she seemed to be quite unable to assist in her own recovery. There seemed to be an inhibition of will power for all forms of conduct which had reference to the experiences of the amnesic period. (4) The restoration of memory was accompanied by a renewed interest in her work and in the events she had forgotten, and her whole personality regained its former character and expression. It is but rarely that an opportunity is afforded of observing an abnormality of the " time feeling " so apparently spontaneous in its origin, so complete in the loss of memory for a prolonged</page><page sequence="27">90 IVY MACKENZIE. yet well-defined period, and so satisfactorily resolved without obvious impairment of the personality. Far more common, though not more easily understood, are some of the allied disorders which supervened on the excessive strain or sudden shocks of war experience. An outline of the record of one of these cases may serve to indicate the extent to which a disturbance of "duration " may be associated with the dissolution of organic harmony. A man of average physique and intelligence, with a good record of industry and conduct, joined the Army in 1915 when he was 39 years of age. He refused promotion as he did not feel equal to the responsibility. He had three attacks of malaria and had taken part in hand to hand fighting on several sections of the Eastern battle-front. On discharge from the Army in 1919 he- is stated to have appeared well, though somewhat nervous. About three months after coming home he became depressed, irritable and sleepless, and occasionally looked dazed. He is reported to have taken " turns " at this time, and in these he became abstracted, confused and oblivious of his surroundings ; he screamed and became so violent that he had to be held down. Between the attacks he was nervous and tremulous, apathetic and lacking in capacity for concentration and had no recollection of what had happened during the periods of maniacal excitement. He complained of headache and of giddiness and had no appetite for food. He was no less disturbed by night than by day. At one time he would be struggling, shouting and digging trenches in his bed; at another he would be searching the house and collecting rubbish. His aberrations of conduct were associated with a variety of hallucinatory phenomena. He imagined he saw the desert, dead men, flashes from bombs and blood on his hands. He thought he heard screams, aeroplanes and guns; and he complained, from time to time, of a foul odour from his hands. When free from the immediate influence of transportation to the</page><page sequence="28">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 91 scenes of his experiences he exhibited signs of constant fear. He suffered from sensations of choking. He had to be accompanied in the street and he was continually watching the sky for aircraft. He would on no account enter a car or train, a church or a picture house. The foregoing summary of his state has been made from an account given by his wife in 1919-20 to one of my assistants under whose bare he was placed in November, 1920. At this time he was so weak physically that it was necessary to take him to the clinic in a taxi and to help him to walk upstairs. His movements were slow and his cerebration was slow. He exhibited within a short period a great variety of emotional reactions. At one moment he would be grinning in a foolish and childish manner, at another he would be tremulous and appear frightened and miserable, and at another he would be apathetic and abstracted. His memory was poor even for events which had occurred a few minutes previously. He remembered very little about the War. He knew he had been in Egypt, that he had been in an engagement with the Turks, that he had fallen off a camel, and that he had had malaria three times. There was considerable somatic disorder. On occasions violent shaking of the whole body was accompanied by profuse perspiration. At other times tremors were confined to the face, hands and legs. He might stagger and sway in walking, and often proceeded by high steps as if going over obstacles. He retched and vomited without apparent cause. His reflexes were all exaggerated and his pulse-rate was, as a rule, about 120 per minute. He improved under sedative and "suggestion" treatment and in six months recovered sufficiently to be able to do some work. His weight rose from 71 stones to 9 stones. His sleep increased to six or seven hours nightly and nightmares occurred</page><page sequence="29">92 IVY MACKENZIE. only about once a fortnight. Headaches were less frequent and less severe. He took his food well. Vomiting and retching had ceased, and his pulse-rate averaged 80 to 90 per minute. This phase of comparative well-being did not long survive his discharge from the clinic to which he was re-admitted in October, 1921. At this time his old complaints had been re-established with their former severity. Severe headaches, violent tremors, vomiting, nightmares and sleeplessness were persistent features. Periodically he passed into states in which he showed no evidence of the excitement or agitation of somatic disorders. Tremors would cease suddenly, his gaze would become fixed, his expression abstracted and he would begin to enact, in a deliberate and dramatic fashion, the part he had played in some scene through which he had passed in his war experience. It was easy to waken him out of this psychomotor reverie, and when this was done and he became once more cognizant of his immediate surroundings, he became tremulous and agitated and complained of headache. His recollection for the events of his military service were still very hazy but he remembered "something about Gaza and El-Arish." With a view to restoring his memory notes were made of the behaviour he exhibited in the hypnagogic state. When he could be induced to talk in this condition he described vividly, and in great detail, the nature of his imaginary surroundings. In one stage of the fugue his behaviour would be a repetition of some war incident-he would kneel down, ease round his water-bottle and open it, raise the head of a fallen comrade and give him a drink; the man having died, he would lay down the head on the ground, stand up straight, look down mournfully and make some remarks. By careful suggestion he might be persuaded, while still entranced, to talk about the imaginary scenes in which he was centred. If, in so doing, he came to a specially revolting</page><page sequence="30">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 93 experience he would hold his head in his hands, grind his teeth and, complaining of pains in his abdomen, would probably lose the power of his legs. On being " awakened " he was encouraged to continue his narrative. He looked frightened, trembled violently, complained of severe headache and was induced, with difficulty, to recount the details of incidents whose recollection obviously produced great suffering. The procedure of instituting and maintaining a continuity of experience between the trance and " waking " states was pursued over a period of four months. During this time sedatives were not given and neither on this nor on the previous occasion of his treatment at the clinic was he deliberately hypnotized. It is clear from the account of his behaviour that spontaneous self- hypnotism was the outstanding pathological feature of his con- dition, and the treatment resolved itself into an attempt to bring the experience content of these hypnotic states into line with the acts and feelings of immediate perception. His memory for the war events which formed the content of the fugues became gradually integrated with his ordinary conscious life, such as it was. Though still nervous and apprehensive, emotionally unstable and lacking in confidence, he complained less of head- aches, took his food better, slept better and had only occasional nightmares. Associated with the redintegration of memory for a disagreeable past there was a decided tendency for that past to become less and less the embodiment of fugues. He was now able through the restoration which had taken place to give a rational explanation of many of his peculiar forms of automatic behaviour. He described, without being hypnotized, the dis- gusting scenes to which he related his retching and vomiting, and a habit he had of smelling his hands and wiping them on the floor or on his coat. Other habits, as well as hallucinatory phenomena, were referred to events which had been brought within the range of his recollection.</page><page sequence="31">94 Ivy Ac~CNZIE. At the beginning of 1922 his health had so far improved that he was able to go about alone on the streets; but that he was still far from well is indicated by the opinion of the doctor, under whose care he then was that " he is so unstable that he will probably be unfit to earn a living." The Ministry of Pensions, in compliance with regulations, framed no doubt with the best intentions, sent him to another therapeutic centre, and thence to an occupational centre in England. There he was supposed to undergo treatment and training as a ship's steward and cook. Whatever may have been the view of those who were conducting the experiment there can be no doubt as to its failure. He returned to his home in February, 1925, in a state of nervous debility which necessitated his immediate removal to hospital. His condition was much the same as it had been at its worst in 1921. He was restless and sleepless and disturbed by nightmares. He was nervous and shaky, and spoke with slow tremulous articulation. He had a facile grin and when asked how he was said he was "in the pink." He exhibited a proclivity to hypnotism similar to that which had been noticed on previous occasions. One morning, on going into his room I found him sitting on a chair by his bedside. He remained perfectly immobile, with his eyes fixed on a picture in a magazine. It was a picture of a battle scene. I took the book from him quietly and he rose and walked steadily to the opposite side of the room where he stood for a few moments. Apparently quite oblivious of his surroundings he acted once again the old scene of the water- bottle and the dying soldier. On being awakened from his fugue he trembled and put his hands on his head. I asked him some- what abruptly how he was feeling; he removed his hands to his side, began to shake and tremble and, smiling foolishly, said "' I'm feeling fine." The apparent repetition in the description of his case is to be explained by the reduction of his personality to a state in which he harped on a limited repertoire, passing</page><page sequence="32">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 95 automatically from one scene of abstraction to another and never capable of comprehending their significance or sequence, or their relation to his immediate surroundings. At first sight it might appear as if this case had little or nothing in common with the one which was first described. In the first case there were certainly no persistent and violent shocks to the nervous system to account for the disturbance of mental equilibrium; nor did the nervous disorder find expression in abnormal reactions of visceral or somatic structures. The casual observer would notice nothing wrong unless it were revealed by conversation that a lapse of memory for a certain period had occurred. In the second case the condition could be related to prolonged and repeated exposure to violent shocks and to the dangers and terrors of the battlefield. A nervous system, unstable to begin with, had become more unstable through attacks of malaria and on this account more susceptible to the disintegrating influence of agonizing experiences. In placing the two cases in the same category account must be taken of the fact that their common features are obscured in the second case by the more profound dissolution of the personality and by the accessory disorders of visceral and somatic reaction. Moreover, there failed to occur in the second case that process of gradual redintegration and re-adaptation, in the development of which anomalies of memory, emotion and will-power were brought to light. By discarding for the moment, however, the main points of difference, it is possible to recognize behind the more superficial phantas- magoria of disease a disorder of the " time feeling " to which all the other abnormal phenomena may be referred. It would be misleading to interpret the disorder of "time feeling" in this case from the point of view of amnesia only. Admittedly he had at one time practically no recollection of his war experience; and that was so even when some of these</page><page sequence="33">96 IVY MACKENZIE. experiences constituted the foundation of his automatic behaviour. For purposes of description it is convenient to regard his con- sciousness as comprising, in addition to the ordinary conscious state, a number of accessory and abnormal states dominated by an exaltation of memory for incidents which had no place in his ordinary recollection. His memory in these abnormal or hypnagogic states was so vivid and so commanding as to render him insensitive to the influences of his immediate surroundings. One state of consciousness prevailed to the exclusion of the other; each found expression in its own peculiar mode of behaviour. His disability was due, not merely to incapacity to remember but also to incapacity to forget-his time was " out of joint." Viewing more closely the disarticulated elements of his behaviour we see that a disordered sense of time is related to defect of perception, distraction of attention and aberration of will-power. Bergson and his followers emphasize the importance of regarding the " percept " as a theoretical concept. The process or act of perception is the outcome of an organization of a series of percepts through "time " relations. The percept itself is spatially determined but it becomes effective only through the medium of those temporal relations of which conscious memory is the mental expression. Movement or behaviour we have regarded as the grand objective of animal existence. We may not be able to explain how consciousness mediates in the guidance of somatic reaction, how awareness which has no extension becomes co-ordinated with bodily movement which has, but we know that consciousness is related to what we call perception and that perception depends on the activity of the sensory system which brings the organism into relation with environment. The percept is the result of selective receptivity on the part of the nervous system. In its adaptation to the requirements of the organism it becomes articulate with organic memory which</page><page sequence="34">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 97 preserves the continuity and identity of the individual. The percept through duration becomes perception, while perception and memory converge through consciousness on action. Sherrington's conception of the part played by the simple reflex as an integral part of nervous action is comparable with that assigned by Bergson to the percept. Speaking of the simple reflex, he says, " there is the co-ordination which a reflex action introduces when it makes an effector organ responsive to the excitement of a receptor, all other parts of the organism being supposed indifferent to and indifferent for that reaction. In this grade of co-ordination the reflex is taken apart, as if separable from all other reflex actions. This is the simple reflex. A simple reflex is probably a purely abstract conception, because all parts of the nervous system are connected together and no part of it is probably ever capable of reaction without affecting and being affected by various other parts, and it is a system certainly never absolutely at rest. But the simple reflex is a convenient, if not a probable, fiction. Reflexes are of various degrees of complexity, and it is helpful in analysing complex reflexes to separate from these reflexes components which we may consider apart and therefore treat as though they were simple reflexes." The analogy is obvious. The simple reflex has no independent existence; in playing a part in co-ordinate movement it must combine with other reflexes after a manner determined by certain temporal and spatial relations. So it is with the percept, which may be regarded as "a convenient, if not a probable, fiction." Percepts constitute the spatial basis of perception, but they function as perceptions only when co-ordinated by the temporal relations known as memory. In this hypothesis may be found a clue to the interpretation of our second case. His behaviour at any particular period was determined by the prevailing state of consciousness. The state of consciousness was in turn the G</page><page sequence="35">98 IVY MACKENZIE. product of percepts activated by a particular phase of memory. The percepts excited by a war picture might be fused for a short time by a memory of his immediate surroundings. In that case he would tremble and look frightened. But if he continued to look at the picture an old field of memory would take command of the percepts with the result that he would be transported in consciousness to the old scenes of activity and would repeat in automatic fashion the behaviour which was adapted to the occasion. So hypersensitive was his feeling of time that in remembering the present he forgot the past, and in remembering the past he forgot the present. Viewed from this standpoint the disturbance of his mental equilibrium was manifested in an inability to forget as well as in an inability to remember. The stable sense of continuity or feeling of time wherein the experiences of life found their due place had become disrupted, and at any particular moment he was at the mercy of what might be regarded as only an average excitement. His attention was readily dis- tracted and abnormally focussed on one illusory or hallucinatory field while he became, for the time being, oblivious to everything else. His emotional reactions were unstable and intense in proportion to the readiness with which he passed from the domina- tion of one phase of memory to that of another. In these circum- stances there was but little will-power left, for all that remained of his personality was represented in facile and terror-stricken reactions interspersed with periods of automatic behaviour. It remains now to inquire whether our considerations of the problem of "time" throw any light on these phenomena, or whether on the contrary the phenomena of amnesia have any importance for a solution of the problem of time. It was con- tended that the doing of time and space, which is incident to all animal growth and movement, is prior to and conditionally antecedent to all ideas of time and space. The co-ordination of all animal movement depends upon the observance of certain</page><page sequence="36">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 99 temporal and spatial relations in which adaptation is preserved both between the individual parts of the animal and between the animal and its environment. In the process of evolution the sphere of experience has increased in extent and in com- plexity pari passu with the differentiation of the organism and more particularly with the differentiations of the sensori-motor system. In the higher branches of the vertebrate phylum, especially in domesticated animals, adaptive reaction is so varied and perfect as to suggest a close affinity to the behaviour of the human species. Man, however, exhibits distinguishing features of a very extraordinary character. He can count, he can make implements, and he can talk. On the basis of these endowments and inventions he proceeds to give further evidence that he'is a creative animal. This creative capacity, which is a product of his inherited capacity for doing time and space, carries with it a tendency for him to think in terms of the environment which he manipulates. He sees it, touches it and changes it, and in so doing, attributes to it an objective existence with which he, as an independent individual has to contend. The fear which he naturally feels is referred to the influence of unseen agencies or to movements in the external world which he does not yet under- stand. He applies his creative powers to the measurement of that world by arbitrary standards of space abstracted from the ideas of space which underlie his invention of numbers. He proceeds to measure the current of events or the feeling of time in terms of spatial measurement, another evidence of the process of selection or abstraction whereby he economizes his experiences. In this way he invents cosmogonies and cosmologies and astrono- mical systems, and thereby imagines he is discovering the universe of which he is a part, but which he imagines to be practically independent of himself. But these are all the results of the growth of his mental activity expressed in an effective use of symbols and the evidence of a creative capacity. They involve G2</page><page sequence="37">100 IVY MACKENZIE. ideas of space and time in a highly complicated context, but they are ideas which are ultimately referable to the simple acts of creation which spring out of the capacity for doing space and time. Cosmologies and science are not, however, the only evidences of man's inventive genius. He has shown his creative power in literature, in art, in social institutions and, in a manner under- lying all these attainments, in the creation of his own personality. It is to the product of this latter creation that we look for light on the disorder of time feeling which occurs in amnesia. Per- sonality, like all human creations, has its origin in that period in the history of sentient nature when man took his stand above the other creatures by virtue of the capacity to count, to talk and to manipulate, and thereby to articulate in his mind a more or less definite awareness or consciousness of himself and of his sur- roundings. At this period, and in virtue of this consciousness, organic time (or automatic memory) became partly represented in conscious memory, automatic (or organic) emotion became partly represented in conscious emotion, impulse came under the influence of inhibition or will, and primary instinct became subject to reason and higher intelligence. These elements which comprise the personality have their roots in the processes of animal life which preceded man in the phylogenetic series. They had gradually become more powerful in their influence and more complicated in their mutual relations. Essentially the product of hereditary and of internal organic regulation, the personality finds a wider and more influential expression in the social institutions which are, in their turn, the products of its creation. Personality, however, is in some degree the possession and product of every human being. Its stability depends on the stability of the nervous system which may be constitutionally weak or impaired by disease. Its ten- dency to dissolution depends on its original stability or instability,</page><page sequence="38">THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SENSE OF TIME. 101 and on the character of the forces by which it is assailed. But when it dissolves it may exhibit in its disintegration a derange- ment of the elements of which it is comprised. They may, and usually do, in part disappear; memory is affected, emotional reactions are anomalous, will-power is impaired, interest is lost and attention is abnormally sustained or deflected. In the process of redintegration memory is usually exalted, thus showing how in normal life a selection is made from impressions or percep- tions adequate to the requirements of normal reactions. The restoration of memory or continuity of experience or feeling of time is imperative to a complete restitution, to a recovery of will-power, of interest, of attention, and of normal emotional reaction. The dissolution of personality may, however, reach a stage from which rehabilitation is impossible. Such a consummation is usually associated either with hereditary defect or with acquired disease of the nervous system. There was no evidence of either of those conditions in the first case. The second has a son who is a feeble-minded epileptic. Epileptics are recognized as being specially prone to aberrations of conduct associated with anomalies of the feeling of time. Reference has been made already to the part played by counting in the evolution of the primitive human mind. That grade of mental deficiency known as feeble-minded- ness is almost invariably reflected in an incapacity to count and read. The counting of the five fingers, it was pointed out, depended on a recognition of their similarity in space and of their succession as five in time. Printed words are the signs of the symbols of thought. In the case of a child with otherwise perfect vision inability to recognize words may be ascribed to a failure to co-ordinate percepts in time. That there is a faulty articulation of spatial percepts in time is indicated by the fact that, although a printed word cannot be recognized by vision alone, it can be picked out from a series of words when it is</page><page sequence="39">102 IVY MACKENZIE. pronounced. It is of great significance that the grosser disorders of time feeling are particularly liable to occur on a basis of congenital mental defect. It may be taken for granted that the construction of a stable personality is possible only on a sound neurological foundation. Time is, then, the generic term for a series of relations which constitute the binding element in the creation we know as personality. Like astronomical time it has grown out of the doing of time. But, whereas astronomical time has been con- ventionalized by arbitrary signs and divided into years and their numerical sub-divisions, personal time is marked by the events of individual experience. Astronomical time has been symbolized in mathematical expressions and has been projected on a plan of the universe. In the theory of relativity it has been deprived of its status as an absolute entity; it has been placed along with space in the category of a fourth dimension, and it has been ultimately reduced to the position where it began as an element in subjective experience. Personal time has never left the conditions in which it had its origin; it began in the doing of time and it remains the essential link in the integrality of doing in the human sense.</page></plain_text>
