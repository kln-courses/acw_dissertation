<plain_text><page sequence="1">VICTORIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1977 Richard C. Tobias, Editor THIS ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY HAS BEEN PRE- pared by a committee of the Victorian Divi- sion of the Moder Language Association: Richard C. Tobias, chairman, University of Pittsburgh; Edward H. Cohen, Rollins Col- lege; Duane DeVries, Polytechnic Institute of New York; Elliot D. Engel, North Caro- lina State University, Raleigh; Ronald E. Freeman, University of California, Los An- geles; Ward Hellstrom, University of Florida; Jack Kolb, University of California, Los An- geles; Edward S. Lauterbach, Purdue Uni- versity; Robert C. Slack, Carnegie-Mellon University; Rodger L. Tarr, Illinois State University. Unless otherwise indicated, the date of publication is 1977. Reference to a page in the bibliography for 1976 in the summer 1977 issue of Victorian Studies or earlier lists is indicated by the following form: See VB 1976, 503. All "See VB" refer- ences are to the original citation in the bibliography. Researchers seeking reviews should examine each issue of the bibliog- raphy between the current date and the original citation. References after five years are dropped; books published in 1973 or earlier are not included, if previously cited. Some significant cross-references are noted, although not all that are possible. An- notations are made at the discretion of the committee members and the editor; some are intended to indicate content, others to em- phasize important contributions. The Bibliography for 1975 initiated a six-part division. Section I includes enumera- tive bibliography relating to the period as well as information and studies of printing and publishing, libraries, and book sales. Sec- tion II lists all books with History in the title, biographies, autobiographies, and docu- ments. Biographies and autobiographies of writers listed in Section VI will not be listed here nor will they be cross-referenced; biog- raphies of painters or other artists will be listed here and cross-referenced at the head of Section IV. Section III includes titles on economic, educational, political, religious, scientific, and social environment. We dis- criminate by including items which concen- trate on the subject rather than its narrative or development. Section IV lists references to all other arts except literature; thus we include discussions of the performing arts, painting, sculpture, photography, architec- ture, household arts, and landscape. Section V is exclusively given to literary history and the development of literary forms. Section VI lists individual authors, first listing significant new editions, and then critical and biograph- ical studies. Journals devoted to single au- thors are listed in single entries, but reviews appearing in specialized journals are listed under the title of the original work. The bibliography entries are made to conform as closely as possible with the Mod- ern Language Association Bibliography Style Sheet and to provide essential information with minimal use of words and punctuation by relying on standard abbreviations, initials, and arabic numbers for both volumes and pages (49:310-21). Journal, Quarterly, Re- view, and Studies in titles of periodicals have SUMMER 1978</page><page sequence="2">Richard C. Tabias been abbreviated throughout as I, Q, R, and St. We use the abbreviations for journal titles printed in the most recent MLA International Bibliography. Place of publication and pub- lisher (press) have often been shortened (e.g., Oxford U.P. for Oxford University Press and NY for New York). When place of publication is clear by designation, such as University of Chicago Press, the entry merely lists the publisher, not the place: U. of Chi- cago P., but Cambridge, MA: HIarvard U.P. The list continues the policy initiated in 1966 of listing in Section VI only publi- cations bearing mainly on the Victorian pe- riod for Conrad, Ford, Shaw, Wells, Yeats, and other transitional figures whose princi- pal works appeared in the twentieth cen- tury. A fuller list of current publications for these writers is contained in the annual MLA International Bibliography. Also, the MLA International Bibliography should be con- sulted for some foreign journals and fest- schriften not normally covered by this com- mittee. The editor gratefully acknowledges the especially valuable research assistance of Barbara Tobias and Mary C. Robertson and the financial support of Dean Jerome Rosen- berg, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Univer- sity of Pittsburgh, in preparation of this bibliography.
