<plain_text><page sequence="1">meaning and morality: a semiotic approach to evil eye accusations in a Greek village MICHAEL HERZFELD--ndiana University theoretical orientations The concept of the evil eye has fared badly in modern anthropology. Neither its early ap- pearance in folklore collections (e.g., Elworthy 1895; Murray-Aynsley 1900), nor its occur- rence in comparatively accessible cultures, sparked much interest in orthodox anthropo- logical circles (but cf. Hardie 1925; Westermarck 1926:414-478; Hocart 1938). It has at- tracted some recent attention as a minor variant of witchcraft (Blum and Blum 1970:43; Douglas 1970; Turner 1964:321-322; but cf. Maloney 1976b:136) and as a folk category of disease (e.g., Blum and Blum 1965, 1970; Stein 1976). Despite a whole volume of essays about it (Maloney 1976a) and the reissue of Elworthy's antiquarian essay, the best argument that anyone could muster in favor of continuing to study the evil eye was that it could "cer- tainly be used as an etic category in cross-cultural research, but permutations of practice do not appear to lead to a satisfactory formulation of theory" (Spooner 1976:281)-a dispiritingly perceptive assessment. It is from this very lack of progress, however, that we can learn the most. Analysis, it is clear, has been concentrated too exclusively on the category of "the evil eye" itself, rather than on the relevant indigenous conceptual schemata. True, the phrase "evil eye" does gloss some of the emic terms more or less efficiently, but this does not guarantee that it can Anthropological approaches to the evil eye have suffered from the analytical inadequacy of the evil eye construct itself. Utilizing material from a Greek (Rhodian) village, this article seeks a wider frame of reference in which evil eye accusations are treated as expressions of a moral-value system and in which that system is shown to articulate con- cepts of fate and character with the criteria for inclusion in the village society. The primary focus is thus semiotic; it is an attempt to show how villagers interpret personal habits and characteristics, including the possession of an allegedly dangerous eye, as signs of the individual's failure to satisfy those membership criteria adequately. On the basis of this ethnographic evidence, it is suggested that the concept of boundary transgression may prove to be a more useful tool of cross-cultural analysis than the generalized stereotype of "the evil eye."

It is not enough to place the phenomenon in a "social context," if one does not also examine critically the basic assumption that the evil eye is indeed the dominant, articulating sym- bol. Such generalized, stereotypic categories as "the evil eye" should be used heuristically rather than as ethnographic "facts" in their own right. Such an approach has already been cogently recommended for "witchcraft" by Crick (1976:109-127) and is foreshadowed in those accounts (especially Ardener 1970; Beidelman 1970; Douglas 1966:123-129; 1970; Turner 1964) in which witchcraft phenomena are treated as features of larger symbolic systems. This, as Crick (1976:110) argues, is a produc- tive development of Evans-Pritchard's (1937) approach to the Zande sociology of knowledge. The other principal line of inquiry led in the opposite direction: what Evans- Pritchard (1937:99-106ff.) called "explanations of misfortune" were treated as correlates of particular social dysfunctions (see also Roberts 1976, on the evil eye). The problem with this approach is that misfortune is itself a normative concept. It entails a range of in- digenous ideas about causation, chance, accountability, personality, and intention, and these must be explored fully in order to give meaning to "witchcraft" in each ethnographic context. Similar complexities arise in connection with "evil eye" phenomena. Until enough studies have been done in particular communities, bringing together data about local morality, symbolism, and boundary concepts, no generalization about "the evil eye" can carry much weight. What is advocated here is a semiotic approach to ethnography, one that treats the formal symbolic system as a code from which individual behaviors-those of accusers and accused alike-derive their meaning. A semiotic investigation of the evil eye should take as its primary object the ways by which people diagnose that and related conditions, the part such diagnoses play in the moral evaluation of fellow villagers, and the kinds of explanations that are offered by all concerned. Hence the need to use the English language gloss as a starting point only: if the evil eye should prove to be part of a larger system of signification, the analysis can be redirected accordingly. What follows is, at one level, an attempt to show how limiting the "evil eye" category can be, unless it is indeed treated within the wider semiotic context in which it is identified. the evil eye In Greece The material for the present exploration of these issues comes from a small rural Greek community. It should be helpful, then, to say something first about the treatment that the evil eye has received in the ethnographic literature on Greece. That treatment has been very uneven. Both Campbell (1964:325, 337-340) and du Boulay (1974:52) briefly attempt to situate ideas about the evil eye in the wider context of local value systems. Campbell argues that the evil eye is considered, as an attribute of Satan, to indicate a person's total lack of social "worth" (timi), while in du Boulay's material the evil eye, as a passive and generalized condition of social relations, is dealt with separately from the deliberate "sorcery" which true sinners are thought to perform. Dionisopoulos-Mass (1976:51-61) establishes a different kind of connection, that between the evil eye and gossip as gradated modes of social context; the only writer to address the terminological aspects analytically, she attempts to demonstrate what would be a remarkable congruence between the ter- minological systems associated with the evil eye and gossip, respectively. Blum and Blum (1965, 1970), working mainly from Northern Greek data, prefer to treat the evil eye as the epiphenomenon of folk medicine; their further concern to establish historical continuity with ancient responses to psychological and physical sickness adds only marginally to the semiotic approach to evil eye 561</page><page sequence="3">miscellany already assembled by the folklorists (especially Lawson 1910:8-15). Finally, and least helpfully, evil eye beliefs and practices are still occasionally represented as evidence of lingering backwardness (e.g., McNall 1974:71-76). This list may not be exhaustive, but it does at least indicate the range of treatment that the evil eye complex in Greece has received from ethnographers, and it shows how sketchy and sporadic that treatment has been. The incomplete nature of these materials does not favor a comprehensive reassessment. They are also geared to quite different concerns and methods, so that it would be both unfair and illogical to expect from them the kind of infor- mation we are looking for here (see also Crick 1976:126). For this reason, I shall concentrate on fresh data, gathered with the problem of social boundaries and their transgression in mind. The emphasis on boundary transgression should not be understood to mean a focus on social control. While it is true that evil eye concepts may change or disappear when people leave the home community (e.g., Cutileiro 1971:277), this may only indicate that they have lost their meaning-rather than some putative function-when removed from their usual setting. The Greek evidence, at least, suggests that social control is inadequate as an ex- planation of the phenomena in question (see also Dionisopoulos-Mass 1976:43). In the com- munity discussed below, those villagers who allegedly possessed the evil eye were regarded as permanently incapable of adjusting their behavior, while their victims were similarly not expected to alter their way of life in response to evil eye afflictions. Ideas about such things were nevertheless held in common by the villagers and used as the basis for passing judg- ment on each other. It would thus seem plausible to posit a communicative role for these ideas and to ask what they "mean" rather than what they "do." This, after first briefly set- ting the scene, I shall now proceed to do. ethnographic context of this study The data presented in what follows come from my fieldwork in Pefko, a small (popula- tion ca. 160) village near the western coast of Rhodes. Pefko is now almost entirely agricul- tural, the main produce being olive oil and grapes, with some subsidiary cultivation of melons; individual farmers also produce peaches, lemons, and vetch for animal fodder. Pastoralism, once fairly extensive, is today practiced by only nine men, some of them on a part-time basis. Of these shepherds, four are non-Rhodians and a fifth is of partly non- Rhodian descent. Pastoralism is thus closely identified with outsiders, and this cleavage is intensified by frequent quarrels over land use rights. The same division is also intensified by the Pefkiots' norm of village endogamy, an aspect of social boundary maintenance that has crucial relevance for the analysis presented below. Until 1949, when four non-Pefkiots took brides in the village and settled there (the residence norm, to which there are currently no exceptions other than when hus- band and wife are both non-Pefkiots, is uxorilocal), the endogamous rule was maintained so rigidly that some Pefkiot women apparently remained unwed by preference-a remarkable situation by the standards of most rural Greek communities (e.g., Campbell 1964:128; du Boulay 1974:91-92; Friedl 1962:48)-rather than take non-Pefkiot husbands. The en- dogamous norm is still cited by villagers in support of their claim to be "one kin" (mia singenia), but high-status Pefkiots now sometimes prefer to marry out rather than accept spouses of lesser standing or education. Baptismal and marriage sponsors are also usually taken from within the community, and the resulting relationship (kumbarosini) may be re- newed between the descendants of those concerned for three or four generations. Although there are some exceptions, both the endocommunal pattern and the repeated 562 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="4">renewal of sponsorship are maintained with striking consistency (see also du Boulay 1974:165-166; and cf. Aschenbrenner 1975). One effect of these rules is to strengthen the sense of communal boundedness. At the same time, however, internal strains are also generated. Thus, while sponsorship is not sup- posed to entail status differences between godparent and spiritual parent, in practice the godparent does enjoy special respect and in return provides his godchildren with at least symbolic material support. The result is that the tie of sponsorship increasingly conflicts with the egalitarian ideals of this endogamous village and eventually breaks down; without any necessary display of hostility, the invitation to sponsor a baptism or wedding is simply not proffered. Elsewhere, on Crete for example, extracommunal spiritual kinship is common and is regarded as a form of "friendship" (filia); its asymmetrical and interest-motivated character is then recognized, at least tacitly. In Pefko, by contrast, "friends" are categorically inferior to kin. This fits logically with other aspects of the Pefkiot system of social norms; while spiritual kin are usually also real kin, so that no moral differentiation can be conceded be- tween them, "friends" are those "outsiders" (kseni) with whom one enjoys close social rela- tionships. An alternative term for "friends," yarenidhes, means only those non-Pefkiots with whom it was once, in the days of animal droving on foot, necessary to have reciprocal ties of hospitality. Such relationships were handed down from father to son on both sides (see also Booth and Booth 1928:149), and a man rarely had (or needed) more than one per village. While yarenis ties were highly valued for both affective and utilitarian reasons, they served to emphasize Pefkiot exclusiveness, since they entailed a categorical opposition be- tween "friends" (outsiders) and "covillagers" (normatively also "kin").1 Pefko thus emerges as an ideal place in which to study the symbolism of social boun- daries and especially the various forms of insider-outsider discrimination. These take the form of a terminological opposition, found throughout Greece, between dhiki mas (insiders to our group) and kseni (outsiders)-a relativistic or "segmentary" terminology, operable at many levels of discrimination, which has a large number of more specific analogs in Pefkiot speech (Herzfeld 1980b). As will become clear, such lines of demarcation are essen- tial to our understanding of what the evil eye concept means in Pefkiot social life. Pefklot concepts of personal destiny and character In order to clarify the "explanation of misfortune" in emic terms, I now turn to Pefkiot ideas about personal accountability and character. Since the symbol of the evil eye is closely associated with the notion of fate (mira or tikhi), which it is said to impede, this area should be explored before we proceed to the actual evil eye accusations. Moreover, the evil eye is said to be a defect of character, and since character and fate are complemen- tarily opposed in the explanation of events by Pefkiots, these two key concepts need to be examined together. Fate may be anthropomorphic, as three (or occasionally seven) women (mires; see also Lawson 1910:121-130). These are said to confer with one another at the house of every seven-day-old baby, there to determine the future course of the child's existence. Their deci- sions are written and irrevocable, and they themselves are impervious to pleas, tricks, and precautions.2 But mira may also denote objective fate, in which sense it is usually interchangeable with tikhi (luck). The tikhero (cognate with tikhi) is again almost synonymous, though it seems to be used most often for a particular misfortune in the immediate past, while riziko (from riza [root] ) denotes personal destiny in its causal sense; newlyweds are wished "Kalorizika" semiotic approach to evil eye 563</page><page sequence="5">(may you have a good destiny). Mira, as a generic term, can be used in place of all these special terms for destiny. Mira is inherent in every person as it is also in the collectivity, so that logically no in- dividual appeal can be addressed to one's own fate in order to overturn the decisions of the general fate. One villager likened fate to the branching village water supply system, which is fed by a "vein" (fle'a) or source, and thereby implied a parallel with the concept of in- herited and innate personality which we meet, for example, in the axiom that thieves are all "of a worthless vein" (apo atimi fleva). Since, moreover, the writ of destiny can only be read by hindsight, inaction and indolence cannot be excused on the grounds that personal effort will make no difference. If, and only if, the Fates have decided favorably, that effort will have made a difference. The old charge of "fatalism" among the Greeks (e.g., Kasper- son 1966:61-62, 166) is a misnomer (see also Politis 1918; Sanders 1962:20), as indeed it may be in peasant societies everywhere (see Ingersoll 1966). In the explanation of human behavior and events, the complement of fate is personal character (fisiko), the aspect of an individual to which blame and responsibility are at- tributed by others. Fisiko is inherited; thus, for example, one Pefkiot was described to me as a police informer "through his father and by patriline (yenia)." "Character," as we should say, disposes one to certain "habits"; in Greek, the same term covers both concepts, so that a mother made her child returned a filched coin with the remark, "I don't want him to learn such fisika." Character and the events that betray it are a single construct in a community where judgment is always based on observed behavior rather than on attempts to hypoth- esize the inner states of individuals. In this way, one has the evil eye as an innate charac- teristic (fisiko), but what gives this condition away to others is the "bad habit" (fisiko) of ex- hibiting excessive curiosity. Destiny and character are the playing cards of reputation and are manipulated accord- ingly. A villager may, for example, be thought fundamentally evil, on the evidential grounds of his having been punished by Cod with childlessness (grusuzis ap' to Theo, "luck- less because of God"). He himself, however, will claim to have been fated to that condition. In this way, too, fate and character are opposed within the context of the Divine Will itself: the Fates do God's bidding, which may entail punishment of the sinner for the conse- quences of his moral weakness. The point is that nobody else knows that he is a sinner, and he himself does not know that fate is going to be unkind to him, until his childlessness has lasted long enough to erase all doubt. The retrospective nature of interpretation here ac- commodates both his viewpoint and that of his detractors. Marriage provides another context in which we can appreciate the moral force of these ideas. A woman may curse her fate (as well as the unfaithful suitor) for a broken engage- ment, which effectively condemns her to spinsterhood since her virginity is no longer cer- tain and her suitor's sudden desertion leads to suspicion about her moral qualities. She blames fate for denying her the married state, itself often simply called "fate" in such con- texts. She is truly "luckless" or, from another perspective, "tainted." Here, as everywhere in Pefkiot social interaction, fate provides a conventional excuse for failure, while character is the springboard of defamation. One's own successes and others' failures are the result of fisiko; conversely, all else is the work of tikhero, the individual's inescapable destiny. terminology and usage The terms encountered in the preceding section provide only a partial context for the study of evil eye concepts. They represent notions of destiny and character as agents in the determination of events; there are other terms that denote the conditions in which people are affected by those agents. 564 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="6">Folk etymology insists, correctly from a philological point of view, that the fates (mires) are Greek: "Would God show us Turkish things?" demanded one informant. The fates are therefore good; it is not the fates, but their negation or absence, which is bad. The com- plementary opposition between the good and the bad is made explicit, since grusuzia (the "negation of fate") is-again correctly-recognized to be a word of Turkish origin.3 As such it can be presented as something entirely foreign to Pefkiot (and Greek) experience; villagers are reluctant to concede the existence of grusuzia in their community, whereas "the Turks are habituated to this sort of thing!" Grusuzia, then, is the "foreign" condition of those (m. grusuzidhes, f. grusuzes) who lack fortune and indeed lack social worth at all. But, paradoxically, such people must in prac- tice be members of the community, because otherwise one would not know them well enough to recognize them as members of this category; "knowing" is a definitional charac- teristic of the relationship between dhiki (people who are insiders of the same group). There is a different term for the worthlessness of outsiders (atimia) which is often-but inade- quately-glossed as "dishonor" (see also Herzfeld 1980a). Atimia and grusuzia, while both forms of "social inversion" (anapodhia; literally, "having one's feet up" in the air), are thus radically opposed in the dimension of social reference (outsiders versus insiders). This has consequences for interpretation. Atimia, as an attribute of outsiders, assumes the worst-that the actions associated with it are intentionally evil; by the same token, they are also impossible to anticipate and therefore unavoidably treacherous. As covillagers, by contrast, grusuzidhes can never be thought culpable in the same degree, although they are congenitally incapable of functioning as good community members. The harm that they do, including the casting of the evil eye, is as involuntary as it is continual. The categorical distinction between atimia and grusuzia thus enables Pefkiots to avoid attributing malicious intentions to their covillagers; while the point of dismissing grusuzia as "Turkish" is that, at the same time, they are not obliged to admit to outsiders (kseni) that such an evil characteristic really persists among community members (dhiki mas). The internal contradiction in the status of grusuzidhes is further elaborated in the Pefkiot kinship ideology. Grusuzidhes are said to "have no patriline (yenia)"; in other words, their character negates the value of their membership in the kin group (singenia) which con- stitutes the village community. Since it is from the patrilines which have contributed to his immediate ancestry that an individual supposedly draws his personality traits,4 this is tanta- mount to saying that grusuzidhes lack both "fortune" and "person." They are contradictory beings, Turk-like in a "pure" Greek community, nonparticipants in the communal "for- tunes," members of an endogamous community who nevertheless lack acknowledged ancestry. This last trait is especially striking in that all the Pefkiots who were identified to me as grusuzidhes in any sense came, without exception, from well-established, "untainted" Pefkiot families. The inmarrying men (maepsaria) and resident non-Pefkiots were of quite unambiguously inferior status and did not present the problem of social definition posed by those who were tagged as grusuzidhes. Although it seems to be used as a synonym for the "evil eye," grusuzia has far wider significance also. There are, however, specifiers for the evil eye (ft(i)armisma, matiasma, nalethi5). Interestingly, there is no person category corresponding to "witch" or "one who casts the evil eye" alone, grusuzis being, as we shall see, a person category of a more general order. Another term in this complex is the neo-classical vaskania, under which name the phenomenon of the evil eye is freely admitted to exist in the village. Like mires, vaskania is a palpably Greek word; it is even validated by "the ecclesiastical books" (there is a local legend that the Virgin was afflicted with it), and, significantly, it is free of asso- ciation with particular accusations against individuals. Unlike the person-specific grusuzia, vaskania can be acknowledged to exist in Pefko because this does not entail singling out the village for special criticism: vaskania afflicts all humanity alike. semiotic approach to evil eye 565</page><page sequence="7">Such terminological niceties are in fact of crucial importance for this analysis. The etymological observations that Pefkiots make about words being "Greek" or "Turkish" can be seen as a form of meta-semiotic commentary, an attempt by the villagers to explain to an outsider (myself) just what the wider cultural implications of identifying grusuzia and vaskania were. At this level, they were not merely reading the signs of particular moral or social states, but were providing an interpretation of the reading itself. At the same time, from my own perspective, their remarks also constituted signs of their perception of the outsider as one who should not be privy to the existence of flawed individuals within the community. Admittedly, they were not entirely successful at maintaining that boundary, some villagers being less reserved than others in their conversations with me; had they all been equally reticent, this article could not have been written. But it was clear that a con- ceptual norm did indeed exist, to the effect that outsiders should not be told about such matters as might reflect adversely upon the village as a whole. With regard to the inclu- sion/exclusion boundary, grusuzia thus has both a semantic content (as a violation or confu- sion of that boundary) and a pragmatic significance (as an index of the addressee's inclu- sion). This brief review of the relevant categories and their local explication should serve to bring out one major point above all: that the conceptual matrix of evil eye beliefs spreads well beyond the symbol of the eye itself. For Pefko, we may summarize that matrix in the following key aspects: (1) matiasma (evil eye) is a special case of grusuzia; (2) grusuzia, as the condition of socially negative insiders who are incapable of acting differently, is op- posed to atimia, the quality of negative outsiders capable of intentional but unpredictable malice; (3) grusuzia is relevant only to the village context, whereas atimia may be imputed at any level of inclusion/exclusion; (4) grusuzia is opposed in another dimension to vaskania, as a "Turkish" quality of insiders (and hence inadmissible before outsiders) versus a "Greek" quality which is applicable to all human beings and exists "everywhere." In this matrix, the pivotal term is clearly grusuzia, and we must now turn to some case materials in order to explore further its relationship to the rest of the terminology and symbolism. case materials: violations of reciprocity Since villagers are unwilling to admit to an outsider that there are grusuzidhes in Pefko at all, it is difficult to obtain any sense of "what sort of people" might be so regarded. The on- ly generalized response, from a male adolescent who had developed a conscious interest in village lore, was that childless, elderly women were particularly prone to have the evil eye, presumably because they would be jealous of others more fortunate than themselves. As we shall see, this correlation by no means corresponds to all the actual cases, and that fact alone should discourage us from attempting similarly crude generalizations of our own Rather, we should address the ways in which villagers recognize grusuzia, a category of their own discourse. To facilitate comparison, I have set out the four principal cases for examination in ab- breviated format, listing (a) alleged powers, and (b) socially deviant habits; explanatory comments are added where necessary. case 1: the Pefko field warden Government employee, mid-forties, living alone; wife residing in Rhodes Town with unmarried daughter until such time as the latter marries. a. alleged powers Meeting with him can cause failure of hunting or fishing, or acci- dent to vehicle, or damage to crops or animals. His eye is said to "t3ke" very effectively. 566 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="8">b. socially deviant habits 1. He fails to reciprocate mandatory coffeehouse hospital- ity. He explains this by saying that he is in mourning for the death of a brother with whom he had quarreled and that it would be unseemly for him to frequent the coffeehouses. It seems, however, that he has in fact long been in the habit of avoiding them. 2. His is criticized for spending too much time with passing tourists, as well as for "spong- ing" off them. He justifies his association with outsiders terminologically, saying that they are no longer "outsiders" (kseni) but "tourists" (turistes). He also drinks up the remains of beer left by the tourists; perhaps worse, from a Pefkiot viewpoint, he invites them into his house for a glass of wine, thereby violating village exclusiveness and raising suspicions about his motives. 3. He is friendly with the shepherds, especially the non-Pefkiots-including one against whom an expulsion attempt was made.6 (Note that the shepherd was not called a grusuzis.) The field warden was suspected of taking bribes from the shepherds when farmers sued them for agricultural damage and was consequently anxious to play down his relations with them.7 He claimed to be a disinterested protector of the rights of both groups. 4. He expresses open admiration for other peoples' property; worse, he fails to add the protective phrase "Ma;allah!" after doing so, so that the object of his praise is immediately ruined.8 He defends himself here on the grounds that he simply likes whatever is good of its kind, without necessarily coveting it; indeed, he denies that he has the power to damage with his "eye." In illustration of his attitude, he claimed that he had been reluctant to "spoil" his wife sexually, a situation that he clearly saw as unusual. He also claims that others are jealous of him, especially of his well-tended crops, and attributes their accusa- tions of grusuzia to this-an interesting reversal suggesting that the suspicion of envy may sometimes be reciprocal. He was in fact the only grusuzis with whom I achieved sufficient- ly close relations to obtain his own view of the matter. His dealings with me transgressed normative boundaries in other ways too: he seemed more than willing to have me write about his position in the village, with all its attendant unpopularity, and was one of the few Pefkiots who ever invited me into their houses.9 case 2: the miser This case is based on informants' memories of an exceptionally wealthy man, now deceased, who had remained heirless and had been thoroughly disliked during his lifetime. a. alleged powers These were much the same as the field warden's, especially in that an admiring remark of his would cause the withering of crops. He allegedly once brought down a bird in full flight by remarking on it.10 b. socially deviant habits 1. Although wealthy by village standards, he was also ex- tremely stingy. 2. This took the form, in part, of giving his laborers dirty and bug-infested food (they were entitled to free sustenance), so that after a while no Pefkiot would work for him. As a result, his grusuzia (in the dual sense of "miserliness" and "dirtiness") forced him to hire kseni (here, non-Pefkiots)-a clear violation of normal practice.11 3. By remaining heirless, he did not channel his considerable property into the pool of resources for the next generation of Pefkiots, as he would otherwise have done under the system of partible inheritance by offspring of both sexes. In addition, he was prevented from building affinal relationships with other families, an anomalous situation in en- dogamous Pefko. case 3: the curious woman This poor, unmarried, middle-aged woman lived alone, and had few dealings of any sort with her fellow Pefkiots. semiotic approach to evil eye 567</page><page sequence="9">a. alleged powers She, like another but older unmarried woman, was noted for her ability to ruin a day's fishing if one chanced to meet her at the start of the day; one elderly man would always turn back on such occasions. b. socially deviant habits 1. She often asks those whom she meets where they are go- ing. This is regarded as a definitive sign of malignant grusuzia. Evil or covetous sentiments are suspected; they are perhaps reciprocated (cf. the reciprocation of envy, case 1. b. 4.), as this proverb suggests: "If it's none of your business, don't ask, and you'll come to no harm!"12 2. After passing someone on the street, she often turns around to stare after them-not only a sign of excessive curiosity, but a dramatization of symbolic reversal (cf. anapodhia). 3. Her stinginess is said to be so great that "she regrets eating." She also lives on crude foodstuffs, preferring the home-baked village bread to urban white bread. The villagers' disapproval of this last trait underscores the importance of context for understanding sym- bolic behavior: a wealthy man was criticized for allegedly eating nonvillage food, such as canned meat products. 4. She is unmarried and childless. A mocking song refers to this circumstance and was quoted to me by a villager as she passed by. 5. She avoids all encounters with groups of people. This is apparently the outcome of a nervous breakdown she suffered in her twenties. case 4: the war victim This is a man in his seventies who originally lost both sight and hearing during World War II when a grenade exploded under the donkey he was riding. When I was in the village, his position was sadder than ever: his sons lived abroad while his wife lay dying in an Athens hospital. He was evidently not regarded as a congenital grusuzis, but the word was used of him with regard to his pitiful circumstances and his case therefore merits attention here. a. alleged powers He was not regarded as having malign powers at all or as lacking good intentions; his condition prevented him, however, from putting those sentiments into practical effect. b. socially deviant habits While his essential goodness of character appeared to be beyond doubt, his condition prevented him from reciprocating coffeehouse hospitality or taking any part in conversations. His case is adduced primarily to indicate the widest extent of the category grusuzis. comments and conclusions These case materials all show that grusuzia is a condition rather than a role. It may be hard to escape imputations of grusuzia, but no Pefkiot willingly admits to being endowed with it, although some seem careless or inept in repressing various personal signs that others might interpret as indicating grusuzia; this presumably demonstrates a degree of in- sensitivity or indifference and has the effect of enhancing an already negative reputation. In such cases, grusuzia evokes hostility; only when others do not feel endangered by it, as in the case of the war victim (case 4), can imputations of grusuzia truly be said to lack any overtones of real hostility. At the most general level, grusuzia is the state of being in which one has no acceptable social identity. This is not the same as having no individual per- sonality; after all, grusuzia can be called a bad fisiko or character trait. But it is a condition in which one does not enjoy the usual reciprocities with one's fellow villagers, and this is 568 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="10">why it is only within the community itself that the condition is feared or even identifiable. Such, in short, is its "meaning," mediated through a series of diagnostic signs. The state of nonreciprocity, moreover, can be restated as a systematic violation of social boundaries. Sometimes the status of dhiki is breached by a failure to reciprocate coffee- house hospitality; conversely, the appropriate reserve towards kseni may be allowed to lapse. These are behaviors which suggest the taint of grusuzia. Note, too, that although ac- cusations of grusuzia are only relevant to the intravillage context, its referents may be found at several levels of the boundary system. Thus, one may associate too freely with foreigners, violate the privacy of members of families other than one's own, or hire non- Pefkiots as laborers; all of these categories, in their respective contexts, are kseni. The concepts of boundary violation and negative reciprocity merge in another important sense: covetousness and inquisitiveness violate the boundary of ksena (other people's prop- erty), but they are also likely to be reciprocated with commensurate envy or dislike. The point is not that the grusuzis really does wither crops or slay animals with his eye, but that he is said to do so. Equally, it is not necessary to be literally childless, envious, iniserly, dirty, palpably unlucky, and lazy in order to be accounted a grusuzis. What matters is that at least one (but not necessarily more than one) of these mutually compatible characteristics is attributed to the person so labeled and is treated as a diagnostic symptom of the moral condition called grusuzia. In more abstract terms, the alleged ill effects of grusuzia are signs that a boundary has been transgressed; the personal symptoms of that condition indicate who the transgressor is likely to have been. Accusations of grusuzia are a means of reciprocating such transgres- sion by expressing dislike for someone who-as a fellow villager-is at least nominally one's own kin and therefore ideally the object of one's undiluted affection. Thus, we can now take into account the perspective of the grusuzis as well as that of his or her detrac- tors. Studies of witchcraft that focus on "deviancy" all too often fail to ask whether the witch's self-view matches other people's opinion of him, so that the situational or indexical character of such labels gets overlooked. Accusations of this sort are in fact a device for expressing personal relationships within the fixed context of the community. The alleged transgressor may actually care very little what others say about him or her, but this is in itself confirmation of an antisocial attitude and may reinforce the impression already created. Thus, a grusuzis such as the Pefkiot field warden (case 1) realizes that he is not so regarded outside the village and, perhaps partly as a consequence of that knowledge, shows clear signs of indifference and even contempt towards his fellow villager's poor estimation of him. This reinforces the point already made, that accusations of grusuzia are generally irrelevant in any interactional context other than that of the village. They are "about" questions of communal participation and observed daily behavior. Take, for example, the village stereotype of the lazy man, a subcategory of grusuzis. He symbolically "binds his luck" (dheni tin tikhi tu) by crossing his hands at the back of his neck or around his knees-gestures, incidentally, which most Pefkiots carefully avoid precisely in order to safeguard their reputations. Everyone sees the lazy man doing this; everyone talks about him critically; and everyone, in so small a community, may be af- fected by his failure to support his family. Since the recognition of misfortune can only be retrospective, he cannot justify his indolence on the grounds that fate will decide anyway. All he can do is to try to manipulate the external signs, if he cares enough, so that others may perhaps be induced to change their minds about him. In fact, as villagers recognize, this is all but impossible. Reputations stick: "It's better to lose your eye than your [good] name," according to the local proverb. But whatever the outcome, the community's role in evaluating the individual is what counts. Being called grusuzis goes far beyond matiasma (casting the evil eye) alone. It is a statement about one's overall standing within the village semiotic approach to evil eye 569</page><page sequence="11">context; in this sense, it may be directly contrasted with atimia, a negative moral condition which is intrusive to any level of social context. It is precisely this boundedness of grusuzia which explains why the grusuzis is said to lack two fundamental attributes, "patriline" and "luck." Since all grusuzidhes are true Pefkiots in the literal sense, saying that they have no patriline is a denial of their identity as covillagers. Similarly, their supposed negation of luck is a communal failure. The grusuzis obstructs the normal flow of good fortune through the community by persistently not engaging in normal reciprocities; the tropic concept of "luck" here stands for the ordinary benefits of village life. The luck of the individual is a subcategory of the community's luck and will be sucked into a destructive vacuum, a moral "black hole," upon encountering the negative condition of grusuzia. The danger that grusuzidhes represent is that of the com- munity's dissolution from within. It is as a symbol of boundary transgression, too, that we may view the malignant eye itself, in its several characteristic forms. The kinds of eye most liable to be associated with grusuzia are those that a Pefkiot might not ordinarily be expected to have and that would therefore seem more appropriate to kseni. Especially suspect are blue and "feline" (gat- thika, i.e., slanted) eyes; the field warden's eyes, it may be noted, were somewhat slanted and hooded. (Significantly, blue eyes are not viewed with such suspicion in two areas of Greece where they are relatively common, Western Crete and the Haliakmon basin of Macedonia.13) Odd eyes thus emerge as an expressive sign of categorical confusion be- tween insiders and outsiders and are consequently an apt visual metaphor for the failure to respect the boundary between those two categories. This is also consistent with a morality that condemns physical weakness or oddity almost as much as behavioral (see also Camp- bell 1964:318). It is moral defectiveness in this extensive sense, I suggest, that attributions of grusuzia are really about. They are attempts to define and come to terms with a fundamental moral flaw in someone who is nevertheless a member of the best of all communities, one's own. The unusual eye, the negation of luck, the lack of "patriline"-these are all metaphors for a besetting incapacity to conform to the village's norms of social interaction. This focus on the symbolism of social boundaries, moreover, fits the ethnographic data better than do the available generalizations about the evil eye as a global isolate. As a more abstract for- mulation, it can accommodate a much wider range of local symbolisms; it allows us to treat the evil eye as one of many possible symbols of social marginality and does not de- mand a priori that it represents exactly the same kind of marginality whenever it does oc- cur. Indeed, even the somewhat uneven Greek evidence challenges the view (Roberts 1976:228) that the evil eye "is not a belief that characteristically varies from village to village." Whereas the Pefkiot grusuzidhes were openly treated with contempt for the most part, one of the outstanding cases that I encountered during my fieldwork on Crete concerned the head of the most powerful lineage, a man who had been village mayor intermittently for a period of 28 years. A methodology that glosses over such differences is not going to shed much light either on the range of societal variation within a given culture or on the communicative aspects of moral evaluation in the societies studied. What is worse, generalizations of this sort can become self-fulfilling prophecies. If the conceptual basis of a cross-cultural survey is not clarified first, increased quantification of the reported data will only magnify existing bias-a point already made by Crick (1976:111; cf. Marwick 1972:383) in the wider context of witchcraft studies. Theory will be better served for the time being by more local-level ethnographic analyses. Such studies will have to take full account of indigenous concepts of inclusion and exclusion in order to provide insights into the relationships between social evaluation 570 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="12">and individual behavior. This is an explicitly semiotic concern: it calls for an examination of indigenous sign systems in relation to both the conceptual boundaries and the interactional situations on which their correct "reading" depends. What is described above is a cognitive system in action. It is true that some notion of a malignant type of eye is entertained by the villagers, but that concept forms part of a much wider complex of ideas, a complex that is expressed through daily events in the community. If it can be shown that the evil eye fits in- to comparable systems wherever it has been reported, some basis for cross-cultural generalization may exist. Otherwise, the search for a unified theory of the evil eye will probably prove to have been a misdirected enterprise. notes Acknowledgments. James L. Brain, Loring M. Danforth, Roger Joseph, and Brian Spooner have all generously commented on earlier versions of this paper. One such version was presented at the 1980 meeting of the Northeastern Anthropological Association in Amherst, MA, as part of the panel "The Ethnography of Meaning" for which James W. Fernandez, as discussant, provided a penetrating com- mentary. The fieldwork on which the paper is based was done in Pefko (a pseudonym) between December 1973 and July 1974, in partial preparation for a doctoral thesis ("Categories of Inclusion and Exclusion in a Rhodian Village" [1976]) written at Oxford under the perceptive guidance of John Camp- bell. Later fieldwork was conducted in the West Cretan highland community of Glendi (a pseudonym), partly for the same project. David Barrett, of the Bodleian Library, provided valuable help with the Turkish and Arabic etymologies. 1 A covillager may be referred to as filos (friend) when the context makes it clear that other ties are not being slighted by contrast; villagers nevertheless insist that, as a generic category, "friends" are kseni by definition. This is an example of the relativism of Pefkiot social terminology, which is par- ticularly fully exemplified by the complementary opposition between kseni and dhiki mas (see below). In Highland Western Crete, where I did fieldwork at various times between 1974 and 1978, yarenis may be used of a covillager. Here, however, baptismal sponsors are chosen from among potential non- village patrons or shepherds wherever possible, and this relationship is described as filia (friendship). 2 In one illustrative Pefkiot story, a child's wet nurse overheard the Fates deciding that the child would die at the age of 14 by drowning (pnigume) in water. When the boy reached the age of 14, he was present at a gathering where an open well had been covered over in order to prevent just such an acci- dent from happening to him. He asked for a glass of water to drink, choked (pnigume), and died. See also du Boulay (1974:82, 96). 3Turkish ugursuz (inauspicious; bringing bad luck; ill omened; rascal [Redhouse 1968:1196]), from ugur (good omen; siz, without). 4 "From seven patrilines [yenies] the child derives [ksefisas)]" (village proverb). Seven is the maximum possible number of patrilines in Ego's ancestry in four ascending generations, being his father's plus six others through uterine links; in the fourth ascending generation, Ego shares a common ancestor with his/her third cousin, who marked the furthest degree of "real" kinship in terms of the traditional incest rules of Pefko; these were more restrictive than those of the Church, which tolerates second-cousin marriage by dispensation. 5 Ftiarmisma or ftarmisma, from Classical Greek ophthalmos (eye). Matiasma derives from Modern Greek mati (eye; Classical ommation [cf. also Dionisopoulos-Mass 1976:45]; verb forms ft(i)armizo, matiazo [cf. Cretan thiarmos, thiarmizo]). Nalethi is derived from colloquial Turkish nalet, from Arabic lanet (malediction; damnation; imprecation; Redhouse 1968:704, 865, s.v. la'net). In Dionisopoulos-Mass's (1976:45) schema, matiasma is the involuntary act of bewitchment; vaskania, the intentional. Such variations in usage are entirely plausible. Her use of the witchcraft- sorcery distinction (1976:56) to "translate" this opposition is nevertheless problematical: intentional use of the evil eye is apparently rare in Greece (but see also Blum and Blum 1970:43, 145), and the other forms of deliberate spellbinding ("sorcery" in du Boulay's [1974:67-69; but cf. Turner 1964] more conventional sense) do not seem to be categorically bracketed with it in opposition to involuntary "bewitchment." Dionisopoulos-Mass (1976:51) further describes vaskania as "such a strong force that often the cure requires the intervention of a priest, as opposed to matiazma, which can be cured by anyone." If this explication is accurate, it means that the priest and his flock use the term vaskania in strongly divergent senses-the priest to mean a general condition, his congregation to denote an ex- plicitly personalized evil (whether or not the culprit is identified in a partiuclar case). In Pefko, certain- ly, grusuzia can be used as a synonym for vaskania as a general evil, but I do not recall ever hearing vaskania used in the person-specific sense of grusuzia. semiotic approach to evil eye 571</page><page sequence="13">6 While I was in Pefko, a similar attempt was underway in the next village-with expectations of comparable failure-against a shepherd of similar origins. In both cases, the grounds were allegedly willful and persistent damage to agricultural property. As Greeks, however, they could not easily be removed on a legal basis from any part of Greek territory. My own position, on the other hand, was more precarious; at the height of the Cyprus crisis in 1974, and apparently because of the hostility of certain Pefkiots, I was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave the country. It may also be significant that while the Greek outsiders living in Pefko were never regarded as grusuzidhes, perhaps because they were obviously beholden to the Pefkiots for their continued residence there, I was ap- parently put in the grusuzis category by some of the old men and alleged to have brought about the persistent drought of that year. Apparently, I was doubly "marginal," a grusuzis who was only minimally an insider (as a village "resident"). 7 The field warden and the same shepherd had one of their characteristically violent quarrels over the fact that the shepherd, having won some money from the field warden in a bet, stood a round of beers without waiting for the field warden to be present. The field warden, however, felt that since his own money was involved he was entitled to a share. This quarrel is interesting in the present context for three reasons. First, it underscores the field warden's penny-pinching attitude; second, it marks am- biguity in the my own/someone else's (ksenoldhiko mu) opposition with regard to the question of to whom the money "belonged"; and third, this private quarrel was conducted in a highly public manner, partly in the field warden's front yard (which abutted one of the main streets), and thereby violated the inside/outside conventions of space. (House entrances are carefully marked by a whitewash floor line for reasons of "cleanness" [kathariotis], i.e., boundary delineation.) 8 Masallah (Turkish, from [learned] Arabic ma shA' Allah, literally "what [wonders] God has willed"). In Turkey, it also denotes a child's blue bead or charm worn against the evil eye (Honey and Iz 1957:231; Redhouse 1968:736; Wehr 1961:495, s.v. ?a'a a). Note that while villagers are aware that this is a Turkish word, as perhaps befits a prophylactic against grusuzia, they mostly do not understand it as an invocation to Allah, but describe it simply as a word that brings protection. (The word's survival in Pefkiot usage probably owes much to this fact, since the Turks are regarded as godless (atheT); thus, the Pefkiots would find it hard to equate Allah with God.) These brief excursions into folk etymology should serve to emphasize the long-neglected ethno- graphic importance of informants' ideas about their own language. This is perhaps especially true in a strongly diglossic culture such as Greece. 9 These were: the two village drunks, the mayor (on my first evening only), an exogamous husband, and the field warden himself. This is an enormous contrast to the generous hospitality that I have often encountered in Greek villages, including (especially) the Cretan village in which I maintained a similar- ly extended residence for fieldwork purposes. 10 Clearly, this is a conventional story; I also heard it of a man, likewise deceased, in Western Crete. It may be formulaic, like the statement that a foreigner "speaks Greek better than we [Greeks] do!" 11 These kseni came from the next village, with which Pefko has long had uneasy relations. Recent attempts to collaborate on olive pest control, for example, are threatened by the Pefkiots' view that such schemes benefit the other village disproportionately. 12 L. M. Danforth (1979:personal communication) assures me that this was not the case where he worked in Macedonia. In Crete, such curiosity is certainly regarded with disapproval but perhaps not quite as fearfully as in Pefko. These instances further point up the dangers inherent in generalizing from any one community about "attitudes associated with the evil eye." 13 Westermarck (1926:419) similarly observes: Fair eyes inspire much fear among the Arabs of the plains and the Jbala, as also in Fez, where such eyes are rare and consequently make an uneasy impression, but not among the Berbers of the Great Atlas and Sus, where fair persons are more numerous. In Western Crete, joined eyebrows are regarded as symptomatic (see also Blum and Blum 1970:146). Other examples of deviant eye features are: red eyes, among the Lugbara (Middleton 1960:241); single eyes, in North India (Crooke 1896:3); disfigurement in or near the left eye, in Eire (Messenger 1969:101); "fair eyes," deep-set eyes, or an angry, wrinkled face, in Morocco (Westermarck 1926:419-420). John Campbell (1975:personal communication) found a particularly notorious case in the Zagori villages of Epirus-a man with a club foot, a hunched back, and a squint. Again, we cannot generalize about the types of ocular oddity that are likely to be significant; the one stable feature is that dangerous eyes are "out of place," in Douglas's (1966) sense, wherever they occur. refererences cited Ardener, E.
