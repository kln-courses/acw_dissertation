La Paz: Los Amigos del Libro, 1969. 129 pp., figures, maps, tables, notes, works cited, list of figures. n.p. (paper). [Fourth rev. ed.] Reviewed by M. EDWARD MOSELEY Harvard University This is an exemplary short report describ- ing the excavation and restoration of an archaeological monument of interest to both tourists and prehistorians. The monument is a sunken rectangular court at the great urban center of Tiahuanaco on the Bolivian side of the Titicaca Basin. Entered by stairs in the south, the court, or "Templete," is some 1.7 m. deep and measures ca. 28.5 x 26.0 m. The sides of the structure are lined with tall, thick slabs of unworked stone spaced 1-3 m. apart. Stone masonry fills the intervening areas, and protruding from these wall sec- tions are irregularly spaced stone tenon heads of anthropomorphic form carved in low relief. Excavations in the center of the court by both Ponce and his predecessor, Wendell C. Bennett, revealed four large an- thropomorphic stelae. The text of Ponce's report is divided into two sections. The first is a good review of previous work at the monument by Bennett a nd others, while the second section describes the excavation and restoration con- ducted by the author between 1961 and 1963. This section is accompanied by an excellent set of detailed maps that rank among the best site plans in South American archaeology. There is also a useful series of photographs covering both the structure and the associated stone sculpture. The report is very good as far as it goes, which is a description of excavation and restoration. It is not, however, analytical. Although illustrated, the stone work is not examined in terms of style. The ceramic remains from the court are not discussed because they are derived from fill thought to postdate the use of the structure.</page><page sequence="2">964 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [74,1972 ] This publication is a very slightly revised edition of the description of the court ex- cavations Ponce published in 1964. Of interest are a few new pages pertaining to dating. The author divides the occupation of Tiahuanaco into five phases. The court is assigned to the third phase because the sculpture and stelae are of red sandstone. Use of this material is believed by Ponce to be indicative of, or synonymous with, the third occupational component at Tiahuana- co. In other words, the dating is based upon the media in which the stone work was executed, and not upon the style of work itself. Extrapolating from C-14 dates obtained elsewhere Ponce considers the phase three occupation of Tiahuanaco to begin at A.D. 133 and to end some 240 years later. If correct this would place con- struction and use of the sunken court in the Early Intermediate Period of the general Andean cultural chronology. Although sunken courts were never a major feature in the Andean area their use had appeared by 1500 B.C. at the Haldas site in coastal Peru. Thus, the Tiahuanaco "Templete" can be viewed as a later example of this minor architectural tradition.</page></plain_text>
