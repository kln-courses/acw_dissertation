Recent archaeological research indicates that much of the Kroeber model of the development of Northwest Coast maritime adaptation as a river to river-mouth to open sea sequence does not fit the data very well. Maritime adaptation based on the ex- tensive use of marine resources was early and rapid on the northern Northwest Coast, rather than a gradual adaptation by peoples moving from the interior to the protected island environment at the mouth of the Fraser River. Comparative artifact typology in- dicates that the earliest known coastal cultures north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca were more similar in lithic technology to central Alaskan hunting/fishing cultures of the same time period and earlier than to cultures of the adjacent continental interior such as Clovis and its derivatives. Comparative artifact typology, site geography, and early dates at Namu indicate that the peoples there at 9700 BP were part of the same early maritime adaptation evident from the carbon isotope analyses at On-Your-Knees Cave just to the north in Alaska. The actual time of the beginning of the intensive use of salmon, including preservation and storage, is unknown, although it was probably 7000 BP or earlier. The Namu zooarchaeological data indicating intensive salmon use, the data from Glenrose emphasizing cervids, and the sea mammal hunting emphasis at Bear Cove, all at about the same period of 5000-6000 BP, suggests that the settlement pattern of permanent winter villages with preservation and storage of salmon and sea- sonal resource extraction sites was well established by this time. The lower Fraser- Strait of Georgia region of southwestern British Columbia is an early area of cultural cli- max. Sociocultural complexity is evident there by 3600 BP with the appearance of many aspects of the ethnographic pattern. Introduction What exactly is a maritime adaptation? For the Northwest Coast, discussion of this concept has centered around extensive use of the wide variety of available marine resources, intensive use of salmon, and both temporal and geographic varia- tions between these two poles. Marine resources were many, ranging from whales to shellfish, with the greatest emphasis and technological elabora- tion in the fishing industry. Of these resources, salmon were the most important because of the huge quantity of fish that appeared during short intervals at predictable times of the year and RoyL.

Maximal use of this resource required per- manent storage facilities and management of the surplus (Carlson 1994, 1996c:215-226). Childe (1957:38-57) emphasized both storage and politi- cal control of surplus goods in understanding the increasing sociocultural complexity of Neolithic agricultural societies. These factors, along with sedentism, are also crucial in explaining the Northwest Coast adaptation even though it was not based on agriculture. Both Matson (1976:306) and Schalk (1977) have emphasized the impor- tance of storage in the development of the North- west Coast economy, but even more important is the technology necessary for capturing salmon in quantity in the first place. The most important technological innovation necessary for salmon to function as capital, was the fish weir. Implicit in the concept of Northwest Coast environmental adaptation are the assumptions that at some point in the past the ancestral population was adapted to some other, different environment, that cultural change occurred, and that sooner or later a primary maritime efficiency was somehow achieved. The Northwest Coast adaptation is one in which peoples who were originally nomadic hunters and gatherers became experts in the ex- ploitation of marine resources with extensive water transport, and who developed a sedentary village-based cultural system with a seasonal round, storage and preservation of foodstuffs, and elaboration of arts and crafts and social institu- tions comparable to that achieved by many agri- cultural societies. It was determined long ago that in the Old World, the Mesolithic with its emphasis on fishing and littoral resources succeeded the big game hunters of the Upper Paleolithic. Even before the corroborative evidence of Folsom and Clovis was discovered, the expectation of scholars was that this same sequence prevailed in the New World. This assumption is inherent in Kroeber's (1939) model of cultural development on the Northwest Coast, the earliest model in which adaptation rather than migration and diffusion played the most significant role. Kroeber thus laid the basis for an ecological approach while still maintaining that the force of history, or what I would call tradi- tion, must be reckoned with. Kroeber's model was brilliant, well ahead of its time, and highly influ- ential in structuring later explanations of North- west Coast prehistory incorporating archaeological data. Its significance today is that its basic features are still employed by some archaeologists in ex- plaining Northwest Coast culture history, in spite of considerable evidence that much of it is no longer tenable. Kroeber (1939) examined the similarities and differences in culture content on both the North- west Coast and its hinterland, the Columbia-Fraser Plateau. He divided these areas into subareas, based partly on spatial continuity and environ- mental- adaptational criteria such as presence or absence of whaling or other subsistence factors, partly on cultural-historical criteria such as lan- guage affiliation, and partly on level of cultural complexity. Kroeber then used these areas and subareas as the basis for a model of the develop- ment of Northwest Coast culture. He proposed a developmental sequence of less maritime to more maritime adaptations in which the ethnographic cultures of the different areas/subareas mirrored the sequent stages. According to his model, this development proceeded from the interior to the coast and then from south to north along the coast: "... the Northwest Coast culture was originally a river or river-mouth culture, later a beach culture, and only finally and in part a seagoing one" (1939:28). Further, the earliest stages in this devel- opmental sequence were similar to the cultures of the interior: "... the recent hinterland cultures of the Columbia-Fraser drainage (Plateau) and of the Intermountain Athabascans evidently provide ap- proximate illustrations of an early stage of North- west Coast culture" (1939:28). Further still, the delta of the Fraser River and the offshore islands had the requisite environmental characteristics for the intermediate stage, adaptation to river mouths: "Still earlier the climax may have lain . . . about the mouth of the Fraser and the opposite shore of Vancouver Island. If the theory is correct that the Northwest culture as a whole originated on rivers and slowly ventured on the open sea, this area [about the mouth of the Fraser and the opposite shore of Vancouver Island] would be the logical one for the first stages of its characterization" (1939:30). Lastly, the most recent and most highly developed stage of adaptation, which was to the open ocean rather than just to protected salt water, took place on the northern Northwest Coast in the Queen Charlotte Islands and adjacent Alexander Archipelago, the territory of the Southern Tlingit and Haida and that of the neighboring Tsimshian proper (Kroeber 1939:29-31). Archaeological data in Kroeber's day were minimal and were largely used to explain culture change in terms of migration and diffusion (see Hill-Tout 1895:112, 1932; Smith 1907:430-438; Drucker 1943). The earliest archaeological exca- vations bearing on maritime adaptation and Kroeber's model were begun in 1946 by Charles Borden at sites on the Fraser delta and by Arden King at the Cattle Point site on nearby San Juan Island. Both localities are in the region of Kroe- ber's proposed "river-mouth" cultures. The most recent variation of this model is that of Matson and Coupland (1995), who attempt to derive the central Northwest Coast (Vancouver Island to the</page><page sequence="3">Zooarchaeological Approaches to Adaptation Carlson: Coastal British Columbia 25 lower Columbia) maritime cultures from Paleo- Indian (Clovis) hunters of the continental interior. This variation has been critiqued elsewhere (Carlson 1995). Kroeber did set the stage for studies of mar- itime adaptation. The following paragraphs pre- sent post-Kroeber summaries of ideas about North- west Coast maritime adaptations and of current data on such adaptations, with particular reference to coastal British Columbia. Three kinds of data are considered: (1) zooarchaeological data from excavated sites, which provide information on which animals and fish were being consumed by the prehistoric inhabitants; (2) isotopie data from prehistoric human skeletons that allow inferences on the relative amounts of marine and terrestrial protein in the diet; and (3) cultural historical rela- tionships as indicated by comparative artifact ty- pology. All dates in the following text are based on uncalibrated C-14 dates. â– a. Charles Borden (1950, 1951) undertook small- scale excavations at five sites on and near the edges of the Fraser River delta. He formulated a chronological sequence for this locality which still stands, and initially saw culture change as a result of migration of interior or up-river Marpole peo- ple, who succeeded an already well adapted "early maritime" culture (now called the Locarno Beach phase) similar to that of coastal Eskimo peoples, and a later cultural fusion (Borden 1970). Borden recognized the value of faunal remains in deter- mining adaptation and tried to have the abundant fauna from his excavations identified. Unfortu- nately, his faunal analyst never completed the job and it is only recently (Steifel 1985) that a report on some of the material has become available. Bor- den inferred adaptation from the presence of vari- ous artifact types, such as the toggling harpoon head as an indicator of sea mammal hunting. Somewhat later, with the excavation of the Mil- liken site near the mouth of Fraser Canyon at one of the main Indian fisheries on the Fraser River, Borden (1975) shifted his emphasis from migration and diffusion to adaptation as a primary process of culture change and interpreted the archaeology very much in line with Kroeber's model even to the point of concluding that the use of shellfish was earlier in interior regions than on the coast. At the same time that Borden was excavating Fraser delta sites, King (1950) was excavating nearby at Cattle Point in the San Juan Islands. Cat- tle Point was the first extensive excavation of a single Northwest Coast shell midden. It took place just before the discovery of radiocarbon dat- ing. King followed Kroeber's model of a transition from land to sea resources. This interpretation is particularly evident in the phase designations he applied to his data: the earliest was the "Island" phase in which "the economic life was better adapted to land than to sea resources"; the second was the "Developmental" phase which "saw the first use of shellfish and an increase in the number of bone and antler artifacts adapted to exploitation of the sea"; and third was the "Maritime" phase in which the remains demonstrated "a full adapta- tion to the exploitation of the sea" (King 1950:12). Identification of the fauna was attempted for the remains from only one of the three seasons of ex- cavation (King 1950:90-92). King's figures pre- sumably are for the numbers of bones of the vari- ous species identified at the site. (Only much later did standardized MM and NISP counts come into use). Fish remains were neither identified nor quantified except to note that the greatest number were from the Maritime phase. King experienced the same problem encountered earlier by Drucker (Fisher 1943:135), who attempted to identify the fish remains from his 1938 test excavations in Coast Tsimshian and Heiltsuk sites: there were no comparative collections of fish bones. In the early 1950s when Alan Bryan (1955, 1963) and I (Carl- son 1954, 1960) were writing our masters' theses on the archaeology of Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands respectively, the head of the Fisheries Department at the University of Washington told us that the abundant fish vertebrae from our exca- vations (which we now know were easily identifi- able salmon) could not be identified. Adaptation continued to be inferred primarily from artifacts, supplemented by whatever faunal identifications could be made. The Cattle Point excavations also produced the first evidence of a dark cultural layer with no molluscan remains underlying the shell midden. King interpreted this to indicate non-use of shell- fish in the context of his "Island" phase, with a culture adapted more to the land than to the sea. More recent ideas on this phenomenon are those of Stein (1992) who views it as the result of disso- lution of the shell through percolating ground wa- ters, and Carlson (1993:19-20) who explains some shell-free layers as house floors and others as rem- nants of sites whose landward edges were always shell-free and were subsequently covered by shell midden deposits as sea level rose and the shore- line, where shells were normally deposited, re- ceded. Early shell midden deposits at the shore- line would be destroyed as sea level rose whereas the landward edges at higher elevations would re- main intact. Thus, the primary variables in the presence/absence of shellfish remains are tapho- nomic or structural factors that have nothing to do with adaptation.</page><page sequence="4">26 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 The tendency in the 1950s and 1960s was to interpret the contents of each major stratigraphie unit in a site as representative of the entire cul- tural pattern at that point in time, rather than as only one part of a complex cultural system whose diverse parts would be represented in the archaeo- logical record by diverse assemblages. No single site will yield evidence of every facet of a given culture during a given time period. It was only in the late 1960s and 1970s that ecological approaches and faunal analyses began to come into their own as indicators of diet, sub- sistence, and adaptation. The fullest presentation of the potential of coastal shell midden deposits in this respect came as part of the research design for the Bella Bella Prehistory Project formulated by Jim Hester (1969, 1978:1-9), and inspired by ear- lier work in California by Meighan (1959) and his students. The shift was away from artifacts and to- ward "the potential of ecological factors being used as diagnostic characteristics suitable for the definition of archaeological phases" (Hester 1969:29). This project brought column sampling, use of multiple screen sizes rather than the stan- dard 1/4 inch mesh, water screening, and matrix analysis to the study of coastal shell middens in British Columbia. Particular attention was paid to the identification and variable distribution of mol- luscan remains through time at the sites of Namu and Kisameet. Mammal and bird remains were also extensively treated, including inferences on seasonal use of the site based on the presence of migratory bird species (Conover 1972, 1978). Conover's conclusions regarding subsistence and adaptation are flawed, however, in that the fish re- mains were neither identified (salmon are merely mentioned) nor incorporated into the results of the study. There were still problems in finding rele- vant comparative collections. It was also deter- mined by later excavation at Namu (R. Carlson 1979) that the two earliest C-14 dates (7800 Â± 200 and 9140 Â± 100 BP) actually date a deposit with no preserved faunal content, indicating that the time span of the early part of the reported faunal se- quence (Conover 1978:Fig. 65) needs to be com- pressed as it actually began about 6000 rather than 9000 BP. The actual subsistence pattern at Namu was finally worked out by Cannon (1991, 1996) using Conover's molluscan figures and the faunal data from subsequent excavations in 1977, 1978, and 1994 (R. Carlson 1979, 1996b). By the late 1970s faunal analysis had achieved a high profile and was being undertaken as part of all coastal excavation projects in British Columbia. Reports on fauna frequently preceded the appearance of reports on other site remains: Galdikas-Briandamour (1972) for various sites; Calvert (1973, 1980) for the St. Mungo site and for the Hesquiat sites; Boucher (1976) for the Helen Point site; Matson (1976) for the Glenrose site; C. Carlson (1979a,b) for the Bear Cove site; and Pomeroy (1980) for the McNaughton Island site. Excavation and analysis of midden deposits by facies was undertaken at the Pender Canal site (Hanson 1991, 1995) using some of the methods employed by Stein (1992) at the English Camp site. Faunal analyses continue to be done today as parts of both research projects and impact as- sessments by archaeological consultants (see Flad- mark 1997 for references). Faunal analyses have become increasingly sophisticated since the early 1970s, culminating with Cannon's (1991) quantita- tive analysis of the faunal remains from Namu which shows both extensive use of all local species and intensive use of salmon as far back in time as there are satisfactory zooarchaeological samples, about 6000 BP. There has been considerable debate about the inception of the intensification of salmon use and the development of the storage-based economy. Cannon (1991:64, 1996:107) and I (Carlson 1996c: Fig. 2) place this event probably 7000 or more years ago. Matson and Coupland (1995:81, 198) think that a general land mammal hunting orienta- tion was the economic base until 4500 years ago, a broad-scale forager adaptation lasted until 3300 BP, and development of the salmon-based storage economy did not take place until the middle of the Locarno Beach phase, about 2800 BP. In view of this debate, and of the importance of salmon to the whole Northwest Coast cultural system, it seems advisable to review the earliest evidence for salmon use within the whole "salmon area," in- cluding both the Northwest Coast and the adjacent Columbia-Fraser Plateau. There are seven sites in British Columbia (Kamloops Lake, Namu, Glen- rose Cannery, Bear Cove, Milliken) and four sites (Five Mile Rapids, Chuck Lake, Marmes Rockshel- ter, Kettle Falls) in adjacent regions in the United States dating before 4500 C-14 years BP that have zooarchaeological evidence for the presence of salmon. Kamloops Lake Recent C-14 dates of 15,500 and 18,000 BP (Carl- son and Klein 1996) on collagen from fossil salmonid bones from Kamloops Lake in the Fraser- Thompson River system indicate the presence of this genus in the Pacific Northwest long before there is evidence for humans. However, the 813C figures indicate these were not anadromous salmon, but freshwater lake or river fish, probably Kokanee. Differentiating freshwater salmonids from sea-run anadromous salmonids on the basis of osteology is an unsolved problem in up-river re- gions. These are the only prehistoric salmonid bones that have been tested so far for 613C.</page><page sequence="5">Carlson: Coastal British Columbia 27 Milliken Fish vertebrae, presumably anadromous salmon, have been reported in pre-Mazama layers (pre- 6800 BP) near the Milliken site on the Fraser River, although no bones of any sort were pre- served in the acidic soils in the early cultural lay- ers. Site geography (Borden 1975:61-63) is still the best clue that the early occupation there began at 9000 BE There would have been little reason to occupy this steep canyon except for the salmon re- source. Some archaeologists have mistakenly put the Milliken site in the interior when it is actually in the coastal environmental zone. Today the site is about 200 km up-river, but when it was first occupied 9000-8000 years ago on the upper part of a sand layer deposited by the Fraser River, the Fraser was running some 18 m above the present high-water level and would have been graded to a much higher sea level (see Mitchell and Pokotylo 1996:Fig. 3). Salt water would have been much closer. from different excavation units than the faunal re- mains, so it is unknown where they fit in this long time span. Matson interprets the relative impor- tance as land mammals (mostly cervids, elk and deer) first, fish second, and shellfish third. Salmon were by far the most important fish, followed dis- tantly by sturgeon, flounder, eulachon, squawfish, and sticklebacks. Stakes from wooden fish weirs in the intertidal zone have been dated between 4590 Â± 50 and 3950 Â± 60 BP (Eldridge and Ache- son 1992:112), complementing slightly younger dates from fish weirs in Alaska (Moss et al. 1990). The presence of a fish weir on a major salmon river such as the Fraser is strongly suggestive of intensification of the dependence on salmon and a storage economy, even though the faunal remains from the excavated portion of the supra-tidal part of this site indicate a season of occupation incon- sistent with the major runs of salmon. An unexca- vated winter village component may well be pres- ent somewhere at this large and complex site. Drynoch Slide Fish bones, possibly salmon, have been reported in pre-Mazama layers at the Drynoch slide on the Thompson River in the interior (Stryd and Rous- seau 1996:185). Bear Cove Bear Cove, situated on an intermittent creek near the mouth of Hardy Bay on northern Vancouver Island, is one of the early sites with a dark shell- free cultural layer at the bottom and a midden with a heavy shell content above it (C. Carlson 1979a,b). The early non-shell component is dated at younger than 8200 and older than 4270 C-14 years BP. It contained an interesting assemblage of fauna (C. Carlson 1979a,b): 332 fish bones with 72% rock fish, 10% salmon, and the rest Pacific cod, pollock, sculpin, greenling, dogfish, and rat fish; 705 mammal bones with 78% of the identifi- able remains sea mammals, and 22% land mam- mals. Of the sea mammals, 80% were porpoise and dolphin, 9% were northern fur seal, 7% were sea lion, and small amounts were sea otter and harbor seal. Land mammals were mostly deer, Canis, and river otter. Bird remains were also present. Glenrose The Glenrose Cannery site is situated on the up- lands bordering the Fraser River just above the present delta. Faunal remains indicate the earliest component was a spring-early summer occupation (Matson 1996:114). The earliest faunal remains are earlier than 4500 BP and probably date sometime between 8150 and 5700 BP; the C-14 dates came Namu This site on the central coast of British Columbia shows continuous deposition of cultural remains for the last 10,000 years (Carlson 1996b). The chronology there is supported by 41 C-14 dates going from 9720 to 480 years ago. Namu is at the mouth of a salmon spawning stream with runs of coho and pink salmon and some sockeye. It is one of those sites in which there are no shellfish re- mains in the earliest component and almost no faunal remains. The earliest preserved faunal re- mains (Cannon 1996) came from Period lc (7620 to 6310 BP) and consist of the following bones: sea lion 1; harbor seal 1; duck 1; salmon vertebrae 19; herring 208; greenling 2; dogfish 1; cod 1. This sample of bones is very small, but does indicate an extensive maritime adaptation. I think there is every reason to believe that this adaptation, in- cluding shellfish usage, extends backward in time through the earlier layers in which there is no pre- served shell and bone, to at least 9700 Â± 140 BP, the earliest date at the site (Carlson 1996b:84). Cannon (1996:107), however, continues to explain the early period absence of shellfish remains more in economic than taphonomic terms. Some shellfish and with them abundant fau- nal bone (Cannon 1991) are found in Period 2 of the Namu sequence- 6000-5000 BP. Salmon bones account for 89% of the fish remains. Herring are underrepresented. The low ratio of salmon head bones to postcranial bones throughout the se- quence suggests that salmon were being dried and preserved, and these data as well as seasonal indi- cators identified by Cannon suggest that Namu was a winter village at this time. The only fish trap evident at the site today is a small stone-walled</page><page sequence="6">Isotopie Evidence of Diet 28 Arctic An thropology 35:1 trap consistent with modern sea levels at the mouth of the stream. In earlier times a much more extensive weir must have been present. Chuck Lake At 8200 BP, locality 1 at this site on Heceta Island in the Alexander Archipelago is the earliest dated shell midden on the Northwest Coast (Ackerman et al. 1985). It contains salmon and other fish, sea lion and other sea mammals, and also deer or cari- bou, small mammals, and birds. Numerically the remains of fish far outnumber the bird and land mammal remains. Locality 1 is 15-18 m above present sea level and about 1.3 km back from the shoreline. The faunal sample is small and the site is not on a salmon spawning stream, and would be unlikely to provide any evidence of intensive salmon use. The assemblage does indicate exten- sive use of marine resources. Five Mile Rapids Thousands of anadromous salmon bones were re- ported by Cressman et al. (1960) at about 7600 BP at this site on the main fishery on the lower Columbia near The Dalles, Oregon. Butler's (1993) later analysis shows that these are mostly post- cranial remains which may indicate drying and storage of the catch. This assemblage is the earliest indication of the intensive use of salmon. The earlier Windust phase component at this site, dated at 9785 Â± 220 BP, has abundant bird and ani- mal remains but no salmon bones (Cressman et al. 1960: Fig. 21). Kettle Falls and Cascade Phase Sites Bones of Pacific salmon as well as artifacts associ- ated with fishing - net weights - have been re- ported (Chance and Chance 1982:421-422) in Shonitkwu period deposits at Kettle Falls on the upper Columbia. This assemblage is not dated by C-14 but is stratigraphically pre-Mazama (pre- 6700 BP). Sites of this period on Hayes Island in- dicate use of watercraft. Bense (1972) reports abundant salmon remains from the up-river Cas- cade phase dating between 8000 and 7000 BP. Marmes Salmonid bones, possibly steelhead, dated at ca. 10,000 BP have been reported in the floodplain deposits at the Marmes Rocksheiter (Caulk 1988). These data indicate that salmonids were pres- ent in the Pacific Northwest before there is any evidence for human occupation, and that they are present in variable frequencies in sites associated with humans beginning by 10,000 years ago. Their presence is not surprising since salmonids are a cold-water genus and are expectable near glacial margins. Whether the salmonids found in early sites in up-river regions such as Marmes were freshwater fish as in Kamloops Lake or anadro- mous salmon, marine fish that migrate up-river to spawn, is impossible to determine from available evidence. The remains from Five Mile Rapids on the Columbia, dated about 7600 BP, are assumed to be anadromous. In view of the large quantity of bones and their context, I think this assumption is correct. On the Fraser salmonid remains of un- known type and frequency are present in sites be- fore 6800 BP. The earliest salmonid remains from the coast are the few bones reported at the Chuck Lake site in southeast Alaska dated about 8200 BP. There is abundant evidence for salmon in later archaeological sites in British Columbia, sites dating after 4500 BP. There are now 102 sites in which fish bones have been identified (Carlson n.d.). Bones of salmon have been found in 76% of the 102 sites. Quantified data are available from 58 of these sites: salmon bones make up 80 to 100% of the total fish assemblage in 24% of the sites; 50 to 100% in 49% of the sites; and less than 1% in only 5% of the sites. In view of the generally ac- cepted and well-documented adage that salmon were the most important aboriginal resource, and certainly the most important fish, why aren't salmon bones the most common remains in most sites? While there are many relevant environmen- tal and taphonomic factors such as site location and bone preservation, there is also the seasonal round. Even in the early period before 4500 BP, the combined evidence from Namu, Bear Cove, and Glenrose indicates the presence of the ethno- graphic pattern of winter villages (Namu), spring and summer resource sites where elk and deer are taken (Glenrose), and special resource sites for tak- ing sea mammals (Bear Cove). In the many more recent sites, inter-site variability in faunal frequen- cies can also be interpreted as a reflection of the seasonal round. Stable carbon isotopie analysis of human bones is the most recent technique brought to bear on mar- itime vs. terrestrial adaptation (Chisholm et al. 1983; Chisholm and Nelson 1983; Lovell et al. 1986; Chisholm 1986). This analysis is applied to human bone and in regions such as the British Columbian and Alaskan coasts, which lack C-4 plants, will give the researcher a ratio of the re- lative amounts of marine and terrestrial protein in the diet of the individual tested. Chisholm (1986) tested samples from 187 individuals from the coast of British Columbia and 77 from the adjacent interior. He concluded that the coastal dwellers obtained 90 Â± 10% of the protein in their</page><page sequence="7">Carlson: Coastal British Columbia 29 diets from marine species, while the later inhabi- tants of the interior regions along the Fraser and Thompson rivers obtained only about 40 to 60 Â± 10% of their dietary protein from marine species, which would have been salmon in these up-river regions. Some variation through time was ob- served for the interior samples. The technique has since been applied to samples from coastal Alaska and up-river regions in Washington and Idaho. The sites which yielded samples dated earlier than 4500 BP are summarized below. The isotopie sig- nature is thought to be invalid on bones that have been burned or heated (Chisholm 1986), and has not been applied to the cremated remains at the Marmes Rocksheiter. A high 813C reading on sam- ples from up-river regions in the Plateau are a clear indication of intensive use of salmon, since salmon are the only available marine species (anadromous salmon do not feed once they enter the fresh water to spawn). Samples from the coast, with its wide variety of marine foods, can only in- dicate marine protein in general. Buhl Tom Green (personal communication, 1997) pro- vided the following information on this skeleton. At 10,675 Â± 95 BP, this is the oldest dated skeleton in the far West. The mesocranic female was buried in a terrace overlooking Kanaka Rapids on the Snake River, ethnographically one of the main salmon fishing sites in southern Idaho. The 813C figure is -19.5%. These figures indicate that there could be a small amount of marine protein - anadromous salmon - in the diet. The problem in this region as well as elsewhere in the interior is that C-4 grasses ingested by herbivores that were in turn eaten by humans provide a carbon isotope signature much the same as for marine protein. In either case, if anadromous salmon were used at all, they constituted only a small part of the diet. On-Your-Knees Cave James Dixon (personal communication, 1997) provided information on this site on Prince of Wales Island, where there are no C-4 plants to complicate the issue. A human jaw bone is dated at 9730 Â± 60 BP (the same age as the bottom of the Namu site). The unpublished isotopie analyses in- dicates almost purely marine protein in the diet. Together with the site location on an island these data indicate a primary maritime adaptation in this area before 9700 BP. Kennewick This burial from the Columbia River near Ken- newick is dated at 8410 Â± 60 BP. Chatters (1997) notes that the 813C value indicates a marine com- ponent in the diet which in this up-river region could mean use of anadromous salmon. However, bison are known to have been in this region at about the same time, so C-4 plants entering the food chain through consumption of terrestrial her- bivores could complicate the isotopie signature. The 8410 date is near the margin of the transition from the Paleoindian-derived Windust phase, with its hunting economy, to the succeeding Cascade phase, with zooarchaeological evidence of river fishing that may mark the beginning of intensive salmon use on the Columbia Plateau. Gore Creek The next youngest Northwest skeleton comes from the up-river Fraser-Thompson river system rather than from the Columbia-Snake. The Gore Creek skeleton was found below Mazama ash and is di- rectly dated at 8250 Â± 115 BP. The skeleton was headless, but study (Cybulski et al. 1981) of the postcranial bones showed that the individual was a young adult male with a tall body build and strong lower limb development, a form typical of an inland hunting adaptation. The 813C is -19.4%, which Chisholm (1986) interprets to mean that ter- restrial protein made up 90% or more of his diet. The additional 10% could have been either marine or terrestrial protein. If the Gore Creek individual was eating herbivores that in turn relied heavily on C-4 grasses, this signature would mimic marine protein in the isotopie analysis. In either case, it is clear that anadromous salmon, if used at all, were not significant to the extent that they later were in this region. Namu Until very recently, tooth crowns from Namu dated at about 9000-8000 BP were the earliest preserved human remains from the coast, but no isotopie analysis has been attempted on these teeth. In the younger shell midden layers at Namu preservation of bone is much improved, and buri- als dating from 5500-4300 BP have been studied. Isotopie analyses of these burials (Chisholm 1986) provide excellent data on the maritime subsistence base at this site. All have over 80%, and most over 90%, marine protein in their diet. Aubrey Cannon (personal communication) has recently advised me that carbon isotope analyses of the dog bones from Namu provide the same signature as the human bones. Other Sites The other late Early Period sites on the coast of British Columbia - Bluejackets Creek in the Queen Charlotte Islands and Pender Canal in the Gulf Islands - all have skeletal data dating between 5500 and 4500 BP and carbon isotope readings of 80 to 100% marine protein in the diet, with most</page><page sequence="8">30 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 at about 90% (Chisholm 1986). These data indi- cate a continuation of the earlier coastal marine adaptation evident at On-Your-Knees Cave at 9700 BP. The next youngest dated material from the up-river interior areas is from Clinton in the Fraser River drainage, where two skeletons dated at 4950 Â±170 gave a reading of -17.2 Ã´^C, which Chisholm (1986) interprets to indicate at least 40 Â± 10% marine protein in the diet. Younger skeletons from along the major rivers of the inte- rior range up to 60% and average 50% marine pro- tein. This figure decreases in skeletons found away from the river (Lovell et al. 1986). Artifactual Evidence Artifacts are also indicative of adaptation or way of life. The earliest possible fishing implement from the coast of British Columbia is a grooved pebble (Carlson 1996b: Fig. 13e) at Namu from a layer dated at 9000 BP. It could be a line weight or small net weight, although such objects are usu- ally interpreted as bolas stones (Cressman et al. 1960). The heavy predominance of chipped stone tools in early Northwest Coast sites has sometimes been taken as an indicator of a land-based hunting subsistence pattern rather than a maritime one. I think this is unlikely. Chipped stone tools are horizon phenomenon, an indicator of retention of an archaic technology. Chipped stone scrapers, knives, drills, projectile heads for arming har- poons, and pebble tools may easily form parts of a maritime tool kit, though obviously not the most diagnostic parts. Their prominence is partly due to the disintegration of the wood, bone, and antler tools that are more clearly associated with fishing technology. The bone artifact assemblage (Carlson 1996b: Figs. 14-18) from Period 2 at Namu- barbs for composite fishhooks and harpoon heads - dated between 5000 and 6000 BP, clearly indicates a technology for making a living from the sea. By 3000 BP there is actual evidence for this technol- ogy from all regions of the coast where it had un- doubtedly been in use from much earlier periods. In addition to being indicators of adaptation, artifacts are also indicators of cultural-historical relationships. A cultural map of the earliest period of occupation in the Pacific Northwest between 9000 and 11,000 years ago would show that the Columbia Plateau was occupied by terrestrial hunting peoples: Clovis, identified by fluted points (Mehringer and Foit 1990), followed by its derivative, Lind Coulee-Windust, with stemmed points that are contemporaneous with other Clovis derivatives such as Folsom even farther east on the Plains. On the coast north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the earliest cultures are characterized by quite different lithic assemblages: pebble tools, fo- liate bifaces, and microblades. To the north in the interior of Alaska are cultures of the Nenana and Denali traditions which are as old or slightly older than Clovis, and whose beginnings (Nenana) pre- date the earliest known coastal cultures. The simi- larities in early coastal lithics are with the foliate bifaces and microblades of the central Alaskan cultures (see Dixon 1993; West 1996), not with the fluted and stemmed lithics of the adjacent interior. Foliate bifaces such as those from early Namu (Carlson 1996b: Figs. 9-11) are typical of the coast and are quite different from the fluted and stemmed points of the interior. Lithic assemblages from central Alaskan sites such as Panguingue Creek I and II (Goebel and Bigelow 1996: Figs. 7-18) and Broken Mammoth (Holmes 1996: Fig. 6.6) would be quite at home in the early Namu assemblage. Zones III and IV at Broken Mammoth (9310 to 11,770 BP) also yielded bones of "salmonoids" (Holmes 1996:314), indicating some knowledge of fishing techniques. Even more different from early midcontinental interior North American lithic in- dustries are the microblade industries typical of both Beringia and early Northwest Coast, in which prepared cores were used to strike blades which in turn were used as insets to form the cutting edges of projectile heads and knives. These comparisons indicate that the early populations of the coast of British Columbia and the Alaska Panhandle were derived from the hunting peoples of central Alaska (see Fig. 1) and not from the peoples who occu- pied the Columbia-Fraser Plateau to the east. The direction of spread was coastwise from the north, then down through Puget Sound and on to the Oregon coast, as well as up the rivers into the inte- rior, where similar lithics postdate the fluted and Figure 1.

Micro-blade industries and foliate bifaces of generalized coastal type are indeed found in the interior, but they suc- ceed the earlier fluted and stemmed point assem- blages (Carlson 1995). Comparative typology indicates that the time and place of transition from arctic terrestrial hunt- ers and river or lake fishers to maritime hunters and fishers was the opposite of the Kroeber mod- els: early rather than late, and on the northern coast rather than the southern. Borden (1975) reached much the same conclusion, but applied it only to the Microblade tradition (his "Early Bo- real"), whereas I would apply it also to the slightly earlier Pebble Tool (Old Cordilleran) tradition (Carlson 1996a:8-9). At 13,500 years ago there were lowered sea levels and both rÃ©fugia and tongues of glacial ice on the northern Northwest Coast in the zone be- tween the Queen Charlotte Islands and the main- land (Josenhans et al. 1995:Fig. 1). Much the same situation presumably prevailed to the north in the Alaska Panhandle. The best hypothesis at present is that initial maritime adaptation based on an ex- tant arctic technology that included fishing took place between 13,500 and 9700 BP on parts of the northern Northwest Coast that are now inundated. While the archaeological record indicates that maritime technology probably developed first on the northern Northwest Coast, rather than in the region around the mouth of the Fraser River in southern British Columbia as Kroeber postulated, some other parts of his model are supported by re- cent research. Kroeber (1939:30) proposed that an early cultural climax took place in this region, and recent archaeological research indicates that this event did take place. The 1984-1986 excavation project at the Pender Canal sites (Carlson and Hobler 1993:25-52; see also Carlson 1996c) in the Gulf Islands off the mouth of the Fraser River was designed to test Kroeber's proposition. The results show that occupation began at the Pender Canal sites shortly before 5000 BP. The carbon isotope analyses indicate a full maritime diet at this time. This diet plus the island location presuppose ad- vanced water craft. By this same date the first indi- cation of increasing social complexity is found, in the form of labret facetting on the teeth of one skeleton. In the succeeding millennium actual labrets are associated with several skeletons. By 3600 BP development of the complex art style of the southern Northwest Coast is indicated by mul- tiple anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures carved on spoon handles. Some of these figures depict masks and others show ribs and joint marks indicative of transformation beliefs and shamanic practices. These spoons are directly associated with the mouth area of burials, indicating the widespread practices of feeding the dead and memorial potlatch. By 3000 BP a wide variety of labrets and ear spools are found, and by 2600 BP artificial cranial deformation is present. Such sym- bols indicate a ranked society. Thus, in the millen- nium between 4000 and 3000 BP, the Northwest Coast adaptation came into flower with evidence for many of those patterns found in the ethno- graphic cultures. Kroeber called his postulated de- velopment a "climax," a period of florescence fol- lowed by a decline in sociocultural complexity. The archaeological record of the lower Fraser and offshore islands, as it is presently understood, sup- ports this concept. The complexity which began by at least 3600 years ago continued in this region through the Marpole phase to about 1500 BP, when there was a decline certainly in the complexity of the art style (and disappearance of some status symbols such as the labret) and probably in overall sociocultural complexity. The factors which brought about this apparent decline remain to be determined, although I suspect it was triggered by a diminution in the supply of salmon. The following conclusions regarding maritime adaptation on the coast of British Columbia and adjacent regions are indicated. (1) Comparative artifact typology indicates that the earliest known coastal cultures north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca were more similar in their lithic technology to central Alaskan hunt- ing/fishing cultures of the same time period than to cultures of the adjacent continental interior. It is probable that the earliest known occupants spread from north to south along the Northwest Coast and were not migrants coming down the rivers from the continental interior. Assuming that the initial inhabitants were not already maritime adapted from having lived along the shores of the now-sub- merged Beringian platform, the transition to mar- itime hunters and fishers took place first on the northern Northwest Coast, not along the protected waterways of southwestern British Columbia. (2) The On-Your-Knees Cave isotopie data and site geography indicate a primary maritime adaptation on the northern Northwest Coast by 9700 BP. The zooarchaeological data from Chuck Lake dated at 8200 BP indicate the extensive use of a variety of marine species as part of this early adaptation: sea lions, salmon and other unidenti- fied fish, and shellfish. Comparative artifact typol- ogy, site geography, and early dates at Namu sug- gest that the peoples there were part of this adaptation even though no faunal remains have been preserved from this early time period at that site. (3) The actual time of the beginning of the in- tensive use of salmon, including preservation and</page><page sequence="10">References 32 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 storage, is unknown. The existence of a seasonal salmon fishery is suggested as far back as 9000 BP by the location of the Milliken site in the narrow canyon of the Fraser River, but is more clearly pre- sent by 7600 BP at Five Mile Rapids and by 6000 BP at Namu. The Namu isotopie data indicate a primary maritime adaptation by the time of the earliest testable skeletal data at 5500-4500 BP, and zooarchaeological data indicate that this adapta- tion was based on the intensive use of salmon. The low relative frequency of salmon head bones at Namu and Five Mile Rapids strongly suggests that salmon were being preserved and stored. There is little reason to believe that such was not the case at most places on the coast by this time. The pres- ence of a fish weir at the Glenrose Cannery site at about 4500 BP is strongly indicative of intensive use of salmon. (4) The Namu zooarchaeological data indicat- ing intensive salmon use, the data from Glenrose emphasizing cervids, and the sea mammal hunting emphasis at Bear Cove, all at about the same time period of 5000-6000 BP, and the data indicating seasonal site occupation suggest that the settle- ment pattern of permanent winter villages with preservation and storage and seasonal resource extraction sites was established by this time. Data from many more sites are needed to test this inference. (5) Identification of the beginning of the salmon fishery in up-river regions of the Plateau, originally occupied by hunting peoples, is compli- cated by factors such as C-4 plants in the food chain affecting isotopie signatures and by the diffi- culty (impossibility?) of differentiating the bones of resident freshwater salmonids from anadromous salmonids without isotopie analysis of the salmon bones themselves. There is about 10% possibility that some sea-run salmonids were being taken far up the Snake by 10,600 BP, and up the Thompson by 8200 BP. The evidence for up-river intensifica- tion of the salmon fishery on the Columbia-Snake is still best demonstrated by the salmon remains from the Roadcut site at Five Mile Rapids. These suggest preservation and storage of the catch by 7600 BP. Once the Kennewick data become avail- able this date may be pushed back 800 years. Salmon bones and some fishing artifacts from Ket- tle Falls and Cascade phase sites at about this same time are further evidence. In the up-river portion of the Fraser there is still no evidence for the intensification of the salmon fishery until the Clinton burials at about 5000 BP. (6) The economic base for the sociocultural complexity evident in the archaeological record of the post 4500 BP period was established before there is much evidence for such complexity itself. This complexity begins about 5000 BP with the first evidence for labrets and climaxes between 4000 and 3000 BP with the first appearances of many aspects of the ethnographic pattern. Acknowledgments.
