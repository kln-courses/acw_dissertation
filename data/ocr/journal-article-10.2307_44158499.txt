<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANVASSING THE ROCK: PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF PAINTINGS IN THE ROCK SHELTERS OF AHMEDPUR AND KATHOTIA, CENTRAL INDIA Shreyanjana Bhattacherjee Laying the Canvas Described in a general capacity, art is our ability to adapt to natural objects or conditions that surround us, to suit our own needs. In modern parlance, of course, an additional premise for acknowledging something as an object of art is the notion of 'aesthetics', which is largely non-utilitarian in nature, whereas, the traditional meaning of art is not divorced from the idea of function. Creativity is also invariably associated with a work of art, and it is indeed the artist's skill to create that we, as observers, are drawn to. It comes as no surprise then when one finds the root of the word 'art' is in the Latin ars which literally translates to 'skill'. Besides 'skill', art can be synonymous with 'illustration', 'representation', 'design' or 'abstraction'. Canvassing the Rock: Report on a Preliminary Survey in Central India Study of rock art involves, in the first place, exploration - large-scale explorations, sometimes, into a completely unknown terrain/area. In November 2013, and subsequently, in February 2014, preliminary exploration was undertaken in the districts of Vidisha and Sehore, respectively. The major rock art sites in the area are situated in the Vindhyan chain of hills. The Vindhyan system is a vast, almost horizontal extension of sandstone, shale and limestone formations, spread across the southern end of the Malwa Plateau, the southern end of the alluvial plains formed by the river Ganga up to the southwestern reaches of western Malwa, the Bundelkhand region covering Chittorgarh to Narsingarh, Bhopal to Sagar, Rewa to Mirzapur. The total geographical area covered by the Vindhyas approximates 1, 03, 600 miles. Geologically, the Vindhyan rock formations have been divided into two separate categories, the Upper and the Lower. While the latter consists of instabilities in the form of pebble beds and agglomerated breccias of sedimentary rocks, the former is comparatively undisturbed, and the majority of rock shelters, discovered so far are found in this Upper Vindhyan formation. Objective and Methodology The main objective of the archaeological survey was documentation - as extensive and detailed as possible, recording the minutest information that could be gleaned out of the surveyed material/site/area. A four-fold documentation process was devised for on-field recording. This included taking photographs of the rock paintings, from every possible angle, making eye copies of the paintings on paper so that details missed out in a photograph can be captured by the naked eye, making maps of the rock shelter where the painting is situated, as well as</page><page sequence="2">ÌHC: Proceedings , 75th Session, 2014 1109 noting the geomorphology of the area of its location. In this preliminary survey, unfortunately, drawings could not be carried out. It is hoped that in course of further explorations, this goal will also be achieved. A detailed recording form was prepared which was used by the team to capture a wide spectrum of data. Figure 1. Four of the districts traversed by the Vindhyas where rock art concentration is reportedly the highest in Madhya Pradesh. One of the major goals of the study was to formulate a standard technique for recording all necessary and relevant information related to a panel/s of rock paintings being studied. It has been noted that studies in the context of Indian rock paintings have been found wanting in this regard as no standard method of recording currently exists, a major reason why it is so difficult to re- trace the footsteps of earlier researchers at any particular site if and when a fresh look at rock paintings is attempted. It is my belief that this lacuna in Indian rock art studies has been one of the major factors discouraging scholars from delving into this specific area of study. The current study does not claim to solve any long-standing problems plaguing the study of rock paintings in India. However, it is an attempt at addressing some of those issues, starting with a thorough form of recording that can be deemed as a step further toward understanding rock art. Ahmedpur (Distt. Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh) Ahmedpur, a village 25 km. north of Vidisha, following the Vidisha- Berasia road was the first site to be visited in the course of the exploration. The hill-site of Ahmedpur (N 23 °35.24' E 77°40.70'), located on the Vindhya mountain range, with a length of 1200m and a maximum height of 550m, was first reported by Khare1 during the course of the Temple Survey Project under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India. At Bilori village, about 22km. from Vidisha, after exiting the highway, a further 3km. ahead lies the village on the bank of the almost dried up Sahodara, a tributary of the Betwa. The village is actually situated on the mound built up by alluvial deposits from the river system and one can see the hill of Ahmedpur, I km. across the field, rising over the horizon in the north-western side of the village. The main geological formations</page><page sequence="3">1110 Archaeology of the region are the Vindhyan sandstone, the Deccan Trap with intertrappian beds, along with lateritic and alluvial soil cover. Figure 2. View of rock shelters from the foothill, along the southern face of Ahmedpur Hill. The Rock Shelters A total of fourteen individual rock shelters were explored and documented in this preliminary survey whereby comprehensive photographic documentation was conducted and extensive notes prepared. The shelters were already ink-marked with a designation number (e.g. Cave A8) by previous recorders/s, presumably by Khare and his team. For the purpose of this study, a new designation number has been ascribed to each shelter. This numbering system is based on a simple first-cum-first-serve basis whereby the first shelter that we visited becomes AHD I, irrespective of whether it was originally number 1 in the previous study (see, Table 1). All the rock paintings, wherever encountered, were photographed, mostly with an IFRAO standard scale, or without it, where it was humanly impossible to reach in order to place the scale. Table 1.

Sehore, Madhya Pradesh) The second round of fieldwork led to the village of Kathotia, located in the periphery of the Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary on the Vindhyas. The rock</page><page sequence="4">IHC: Proceedings, 75th Session, 2014 UU painting site of Kathotia (N 23°04.093' E 77°21.789'), first discovered by Shankar Ti wari in 1975, during his exploration in the Betwa source region along the 'S'-shaped hill ranges, is also known by its local name of Rabiyabad (name of the adjoining village). Although the village falls under the administrative jurisdiction of the district of Sehore, it is best approached from the city of Bhopal via the Bhopal-Kolar highway. As in Ahmedpur, the sandstone formations of the Vindhyas, with their protuberances, along with the intertrappian bed (Deccan Trap), and alluvial deposits, serve as ideal shelters from the elements. Additionally, the moderately dense forest cover gives it a sense of isolation that is ideal for any work of creativity to flourish. This reserved forest area is known to be the habitat of wild animals like panthers, wild boars, bears. One even gets to hear of the occasional tiger sightings. Teak is the predominant plant species growing in the area, besides s his ham , sal , nee m , babool and mahua. There is motorable road till the village of Kathotia, after which, following a southerly direction from the school building, a kilometer-long walk leads to the foot of the hill. A further kilometer and a half, up along the slope of the hill, down a rocky path brings one to the first group of shelters. The Rock Shelters Over sixty painted rock shelters have been reported from the site of Kathotia, out of which ten were documented during the preliminary survey. As at Ahmedpur, the shelters in Kathotia previously ink-marked with a number (e.g. KTK 31) were numbered anew. The following table enumerates the shelters that were visited, and documented. Another point worth mentioning in this regard is the state of preservation of the rock paintings at this site. Compared to Ahmedpur, where villages have grown up around the hill, and human encroachment into the shelters goes on unabated, Kathotia has been spared the marauding human nature. Table 2 is an enumeration of the rock shelters surveyed so far. Table 2. Co-ordinates of rock shelters, preliminary survey, Kathotia (Distt.

We have before us two different sets of data from which to draw some logical corollary. A few of these possibilities have been presented here. Figure 3. Shankha IJpi characters on the wall of a rock shelter, Ahmedpur. Shankha Lipi The so-called Shell inscription, first noted by James Prinsep in 1836, predominates the rock art landscape of Ahmedpur. Significantly, there is no discernible pattern among the characters of this 'script', with only a few of them actually resembling a conch shell. Most others are purely symbolic in nature with no way of telling if they are related to the shell-type pictograms. Therefore, what is actually needed is a separation of these characters into those that are shell-like and those that are not so, but have been bracketed in the category of Shankha lipi characters by previous observers, probably on the basis of them being found in such close proximity to the former. Similar characters have been reported from the nearby archaeological site of Udaigiri, albeit the latter are in the form of petroglyphs3. Proximity of the two sites begs the question of contact and influence - knowledge spreading from one place to another. In this regard, a wider area of study might help throw some light on this hypothesis. Chronology With very little contextual data, underpinning chronology at both the sites will be a matter of conjecture. The advantage that Ahmedpur exercises over Kathotia, however, is the presence of the panel containing an inscription in the Brahmi script, located in AHD VA. A relative chronology can be established of the paintings situated in the same shelter at least. Also, given the fact that most rock shelters at Ahmedpur contain Shankha lipi characters, and since a more or less accepted time period, i.e. pre-Gupta to at least circa 1000 CE4 has been established for the script's prevalence, the paintings bearing these characters can be more or less bracketed around this epoch. Paintings in green have been sometimes assigned to the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods making them the earliest occurring paintings on record5.</page><page sequence="6">IHC : Proceedings , 75th Session , 2014 1113 However, in Kathotia, where a panel in green was recorded, this does not ring true, given the relatively well-off state of preservation, coupled with only a thin film of encrustation, and lack of any superimposed paintings on the green painting. However, in the complete absence of radiocarbon Figure 4. Brahmi inscription on the ceiling Figure 5. Painting in green from KATH VIII Kathotia dates, or any chemical analysis of the paint, it will be wrong to jump to conclusions and thus intensive studies have to be carried out to clear the air. Temporal classification of Indian rock paintings has largely been premised on stylistic grounds. However, in the absence of charcoal specimens for radiocarbon dating, the next best mode of chronological analysis could be chemical treatment and study of the paint used in the paintings. Mineral encrustation on a painting/s can also give us a rough idea as to the relative age of two or more paintings. Subject Matter A particularly pertinent feature noted both at Ahmedpur as well as Kathotia, a specific subject has relatively tended to dominate the paintings over others. While in the case of Ahmedpur, almost all the rock shelters yielded motifs resembling characters of the Shankha lipi script, in the case of Kathotia, the preponderant representation was that of anthropomorphs and zoomorphs. Also noticeable is the fact that the stray anthropomorph or zoomorph found in Ahmedpur is slightly crude in its depiction, while the symbolic motifs, on the other hand, seem to have been composed with utmost care ensuring that minute details do not get left out. In the portrayals of interaction between humans and their natural surroundings in Kathotia the art form appears more sophisticated. Various patterns have been drawn on some of the figures, both anthropomorphic as well zoomorphic. These patterns include spirals shaped in a circle or square, zigzagged lines drawn across the body of animals and birds. At Ahmedpur, animal drawings have been found depicted in the so-called x-ray view wherein the innards of the animal have been depicted. Pictograms of symbols like the geometric pi, the triangle, or the square have also been documented from Kathotia. Color The majority of the paintings at Ahmedpur Hill have been executed in red color and its various shades, accounting for over 90% of the images so far</page><page sequence="7">1114 Archaeology recorded. A handful of specimens have been composed of the color white, with a few in black. Similar to Ahmedpur, Kathotia too displayed a majority of paintings in red, accounting for over 70% of the total paintings documented so far. White paintings are a distant second, while there is the lone painting in green from KATHVIII. Chart 1A and IB. The distribution pattern of different colors used in the rock paintings at Ahmedpur (left) and at Kathotia (right). It is, however, not clear why Ahmedpur has paintings in black color, conspicuous by its absence in Kathotia, despite the fact that both sites are formed on the intertrappian black soil. It is widely believed that the color black was prepared from this black soil, and hence the phenomena of occurrence or non- occurrence, of black paintings need to be analyzed through the lens of the artists' preferences. Choice of Canvas The choice of canvas on which the paintings were laid out is more or less uniform so far as intra-site comparisons go. All the paintings at Ahmedpur, so far documented, have been executed on the walls of the rock shelters, sometimes even in small niches in those walls. The latter also has paintings placed in the ceilings of some of the shelters, some of which are quite impossible to reach under present conditions, and had to be photographed from a distance. Abundant use of available space is more evident at Kathotia where the number of individual panels of paintings is much higher than what has been noticed at Ahmedpur, although superimposed paintings are slightly higher at the latter. The nature of the rock surface also holds a key to the selection of canvas. The selection of canvas by the artist is one of the critical decisions in the whole process of producing a painting. To even start cerebrating about the emotional choices of the creators of these rock paintings, not only does one need to take into consideration the choice of canvas but also look beyond the rock</page><page sequence="8">IHC: Proceedings , 75th Session, 2014 1115 shelter and into the immediate surroundings to discern the role, if any, it might have played in deciding the specific setting/s in which we find the rock paintings today. Looking Ahead The observations made, and information collected, in the course of the preliminary survey of rock paintings in the districts of Vidisha and Sehore have brought forth two important things: firstly, in both the cases of Ahmedpur as well Kathotia, despite being reported in scholarly circles, no attempt has been made, so far, to systematically record the sites. Secondly, while the quarrying and mining industries pose a serious threat in Vidisha, the tourism industry brings its own share of problems in Kathotia with the site being developed as an 'adventure point'. From the initial forays at Kathotia, looking at the well-preserved state of most of the paintings it was evident that human intrusion has been very restricted so far. However, much can change with the changing economic landscape of the region. Thus, a systematic survey of both the above-mentioned sites is deemed suitable, as well as necessary, in the light of not only the concerns stated above, but also a more focused study in the vicinity of both sites will help, one hopes, in understanding the nature of the paintings and the space surrounding them.
