<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEA 74 THE VIZIER PASER By V. A. DONOHUE The description of a statuette-base bearing the names and titles of the Ramesside vizier (University College of Swansea, Wellcome Museum of Antiquities W.232) is followed by an annotated catalogue of his monuments. In an appendix it is argued that certain titles occurring upon four statues of Paser refer to the cult of Ramesses II, and are perhaps to be translated 'Priest of Usermaatre the pre-eminent', and 'Priest of Ramesses, sun of the isles'. READERS of the Journal will have become increasingly aware of the variety of Egyptian material comprised within the collections formed by Sir Henry Wellcome, and particularly of that portion now administered by the University College of Swansea as the nucleus of its Museum of Antiquities. The description of a further object at Swansea, bearing the name and titles of the Ramesside vizier Paser, affords an opportunity to present a revised documentation for this celebrated individual, together with notes on other of his monuments elsewhere in Britain.1 Acquired without details of provenance at the sale of the MacGregor collection in I922,2 W.232 is a rectangular plaque, measuring 9X5.1 X2.4 cm and inscribed on each surface with inlaid hieroglyphs contained within a border (pls. XVII, 3-4, XVIII and figs. I-2). Its structure has been analysed by Dr G. Kelling of the Department of Geology and Oceanography, University College of Swansea, who reports: The tablet is composed mainly of artificial (non-natural) material and two layers are present. There is a thin (I.0-1.5 mm) outer skin of blue-grey 'glaze' which consists of artificially fused angular quartz grains of fine sand grade. This glaze is of rather poor quality since a number of minute gas-holes can be observed under the microscope together with traces of kaolin, probably derived from minor amounts of clay originally incorporated in the crushed quartz. The yellow-brown 'core' material is poorly indurated or semi-friable but is also composed of fine quartz sand. This layer is highly porous and evidently originated from crushed quartz, similar to the material of the outer, glazed layer, but less intensely fused, 1 For information and practical assistance I am grateful to Mrs B. Adams, Mrs H. C. Adamson, Dr M. L. Bierbrier, Mrs M. Hill, Dr D. Jones, Dr G. Kelling, Professor K. A. Kitchen, Dr M. F. Laming Macadam, Mrs D. N. E. Magee, Dr J. Malek, Mlle G. Pierrat, and the late Professor T. W. Thacker. My principal debt is to Dr K. Bosse Griffiths for her encouragement to study the Wellcome material since its arrival in Swansea, and to her, Professor J. Gwyn Griffiths, and Dr A. B. Lloyd for the provision of every facility, including the excellent photographs taken by Mr R. P. Davies. 2 An accompanying label reads: '1 3 703 QQ TP EGY Small glazed tile with inscription on all sides, 3 X 2" thick. Soth. 26/6 to 6/7/22. Lot 1550. McGregor. Case No. 7407.' See [A. E.

Approximately two-thirds of the surface of the tablet is covered by a dark brown veneer (less than o. i mm thick) of an organic substance, possibly a wax of some kind. This veneer must be of late date since it covers many of the broken and chipped edges of the tablet. The hieroglyphics and other decorations appear to have been cut into the glaze by some sharp instrument to an average depth of about 2 mm and were then infilled with a paste of soft white alabaster (gypsum or crystalline calcium sulphate). Dr Kelling adds that the composition appears to correspond most closely to 'ordinary faience' as defined by Lucas.3 Abrasion of the edges, where in one place a detached flake has recently been restored, has resulted in damage to a number of signs. Three depressions, cut through the glaze and border inlay of what the alignment of the lateral inscription identifies as aits upper surface (pl. XVII, 3-4, fig. ), reveal that the plaque was intended to serve as the base of a statuette. Whether of wood, stone, metal or composite structure,4 this seems most probably to have reprepresented Paser standing, his left foot slightly advanced,5 advanced, and to have been approximately 15 cm in height.6 Identical columns of inscription occur on both upper and lower surfaces: Governor of the city, vizier Paser, justified. Commencing on the short surface behind the feet sockets, the lateral text is continuous (pl. XVIII and fig. 2): 3 'Iry-prt Ihty-r it-ntr mry ntr 4&lt;tayty&gt;s;b Ph m ib hyp ht hr shrzw rh 5s&gt;hkr nsw m tit,f dsrt 6hry ssti &lt;m&gt; hwt-nt imy-r niwt tity P;sr [mr-hrw]: Prince, count, god's father, beloved of the god, chief justice,a who is favoured in the heart,b who keeps silent about the affairs of the palace,c who adorns the kingd in his sacred image, master of secrets in the mansion of the red crown,e governor of the city, vizier Paser, [justified.] In the comments the first reference is to the list which follows. a An ellipsis is indicated by i. i: KRI III, 8, i6; III. 3: fig. 4; and iii. 8: KRI III, i6, 3 where iry-prt hIty-r is followed by tuyty sib (and where sib appears also to serve as the first element in sib iry Nhn).

See R. el-Sayed, LaDeesse Neith de Sais (Cairo, I982), I, I65; II, 378. Of Paser's career the outlines are now established. The son of Nebnetjeru, High Priest of Amun,7 he joined the court of Sethos I, to be appointed Principal Companion and then Chief Chamberlain.8 Since the latter's functions involved placing the crowns and other regalia upon the person of the king,9 reflected in our inscription by the epithet shkr nsw m bit f dsrwt, and in view of his other titles as High Priest of Werethekaw and Master of Secrets of the Two Goddesses, it has been suggested that it was Paser who performed the act of coronation at the beginning of Ramesses II's 'prince-regency'.10 If so, it will probably have been under the regency 7 That Nebnetjeru held office under Sethos I is indicated by his portrayal as High Priest in Paser's tomb, with the cartouches of Sethos I upon his robe, and is reflected also in texts and scenes dated to this reign by Paser's characterization, when already vizier, as 'son of the High Priest of Amun, Nebnetjeru': see K. A. Kitchen, Acts of the First International Congress of Egyptology (Berlin, 1979), 386; cf. G. Lefebvre, Histoire des grands pretres d'Amon de Karnak (Paris, 1929), I 115-17. A fragmentary graffito (v. 3 in the list below) dated to year I7 of Ramesses II and mentioning Nebnetjeru, which had led H. Kees (Das Priestertum im dgyptischen Staat (Leiden and Cologne, 1953), i I8) to posit a second Nebnetjeru as High Priest at this time, and W. Helck (Zur Verwaltung des Mittleren und Neuen Reiches (Leiden and Cologne, 1958), 313-14) to argue that the father of Paser only succeeded to the High Priesthood under Ramesses II, has been convincingly shown by Kitchen to be a posthumous reference within an inscription relating to Paser himself (loc. cit.; JEA 6i (1975), 267). For the erroneous suggestion that Nebnetjeru was High Priest not in Thebes but in Hermonthis, first raised and rejected by Lefebvre (loc. cit.; see also n. I4 below), and later urged by R. Anthes, ZAS 67 (I931), 2-9, see Kees, op. cit. 98-9. The date of Nebnetjeru's appointment is uncertain (Lefebvre, op. cit. 115; Kitchen, Acts, 389 n. 29); a terminus ad quem for his demise is the Festival of Opet in Ramesses II's first regnal year, at which Nebwenenef was elected to the High Priesthood (KRI III, 282-5). 8 KRI I, 299, Off. 9 A.

He wears a composite duplex wig, short beard, the long vizieral tunic secured by two straps tied behind his neck in a 'shoulder knot', and sandals.24 His left arm is crooked to support the pedestal of a statuette of Ptah which rests against Paser's left breast and is held in place by his right hand, crossed over the stomach.25 The figure of Ptah lacks its head: a horizontal drill hole observed at the time of discovery (see below, n. 26) indicates either an ancient restoration or perhaps that the head was originally fashioned in another material. As its form and inscriptions suggest, the statue was set up in the temple of Ptah at Memphis, apparently at the main southern entrance beside the Abu'l-Hol colossus of Ramesses II. With other sculpture of the New Kingdom and Late Period it was discovered by Joseph Hekekyan Bey in 1852, and parts of the text were recorded by Alice Lieder during her visit to Memphis in the following year.26 Entering the collection at Alnwick Castle, for which it will have been acquired by the 4th Duke of Northumberland, it passed with the greater part of that collection to the University of Durham in 1950. Each shoulder bears a short inscription (fig. 3), the interpretation of which is considered in the appendix below. Upon the upper part of the tunic, across the chest, is inscribed: Governor of the city, vizier Paser, justified. The main text, of which (fig. 4) is a revised copy, occupies three vertical columns on the skirt of the tunic, and may be translated: 1A boon which the king gives to Ptah, south of his wall, lord of Ankhtawy: that you may cause to be steadfast my limbs 2in upholding your perfection, my arms in supporting your joyfulnessa every dayb; and that my name be established and enduring in your temple; for the ka of the prince, count, chief justice, senior warden of Nekhen,c priest of Maat, governor of the city, vizier Paser, justified. a ndm-ib'k. b m hrt hrw &lt;nt rr nb&gt;.

Elsewhere their apparently sole attestation is upon the arms of a statue of one Mentuhotep, perhaps to be identified with the vizier and son-in-law of Taharqa.29 The variant writings are shown in the accompanying fig. 6: none would seem to be significant other than the presence on the right arm of Durham N.5 I I of the prenomen of Ramesses II. Following the free rendering by Birch,30 Roeder, in his treatment of the Mentuhotep-inscriptions,31 read the R-text as hm-ntr srt 'Inpw, 'Prophet der Gottin Nase des Schakals', and L as hm-ntr Rr-nbw, 'Prophet des Gottes Re'-nebu'. More recently Gaballa has hazarded for L 'hm-ntr Pih nbw, "prophet of him who illuminates all", i.e. the sun-god',32 whilst Simpson, accepting Roeder's opinion in relation to R, 'priest of the Nose of Anubis', provisionally understands L to be hm-ntr j;h (?) nbw, 'priest of the radiance of the lords (?)'.33 Although I have no great confidence that my own suggestions will ultimately prove to be correct in detail, it seems at least possible to elucidate the general sense in which these titles were intended.34 An initial clue is perhaps afforded by association.

Under the Sixth Dynasty the title hm-ntr hwy IHr, 'priest of the two children of Horus',35 occurs in three closely defined sequences. In the tomb of Khuenukh at Meir36 its owner appears as: hry-hb n db;t, hry-hb mit Hr dt Hr, hm-ntr hk4 hm-ntr dsrt hm bow P hm b;w Nhn n 9 ; I M hry sst; n ntr nfr; amongst the titles of Wernu in his mastaba at Saqqara37 are: [hry-hb] mit Hr d&amp;t .Hr, hm-ntr hkr [hry-hb] rq mit J , ) \ hry-hb wr-idt hry sst; n pr-dw;t, ss.md;t-ntr; and the cylinder- seal of an unnamed functionary who held office under Pepy II38 defines him as: hry-hb mit Hr d;t Hr hq; mwty (?) hry-hb hry ssto n pr-dw;t hry-hb rq mit ;Jj hry-hb wr idt. All three individuals range the title with others that identify their office as hry-hb and specify privileged tasks related to the pr-dw;t and/or db;t, in which the king was daily washed and attired.39 Thus in the roles of hm-ntr dsrt and hry-hb wr-idt are performed the matutinal acts of clothing and purification, whilst their symbolic conferment of magical protection is articulated by the hm-ntr hk' and the ssa md4t-ntr.40 In the present context something of the relevance of the hwy .H,r, itself a formulation seemingly inherited from the courtly traditions of pre- and proto- dynastic times and centred upon the Horian personality of the living ruler,41 is revealed by Pyramid Texts Â§619 which pictures them in the act of carrying the deceased king. This aspect of their duties receives further definition in an early association with the souls of Pe and Nekhen, already indicated by the juxtaposition of their r espective priesthoods in the titulary of Khuenukh, and elaborated in Spells 157 and i58 of the Coffin Texts, where the Souls of Pe are identified as Horus, Imsety, and Hapy and those of Nekhen as Horus, Duamutef, and Khebsenuf.42 So, also (although in reliefs from the sun temple of Niusee the sun temple of Niuserre the task of carrying the king in procession is allotted to the wrsyw, 'Guardians', of Pe and Nekhen,43 a group that are in the Pyramid Texts affiliated to the souls of the two localities)44 in temple scenes of the New Kingdom and later it is the souls, and on occasion the king's sons 35 Cf.

DONOHUE themselves, who are shown performing this role.45 Similarly, the association of the children of Horus in Pyramid Texts Â§ 620 with the appearance of the king in the hnw-bark is echoed in later depictions of the sacred barks borne aloft by the souls,46 and may therefore help to clarify the titles of [hry-hb] mit Hr dIt Hr and [hry-hb] rq mit as they are quoted in the Sixth Dynasty protocols. It would thus appear that during the Old Kingdom the Old Kingdom the function of the priest of the he two children of Horus within the pr-dw;t and the dbot, in parallel to the priests of the souls of Pe and Nekhen, was to supervise the ceremonial emergence of the king in the sedes gestatoria, presumably at the conclusion of his toilet. In view of the probability that this reflects a patriarchal custom in which the ruler was supported and protected by his sons,47 it is noteworthy both that a significant proportion of those holding the title of hry st n pr-dwt are at this timeat this time viziers, and that many of the latter are also described as 'king's son'.48 The survival of these associations is attested for the Middle Kingdom by the subsidiary titles of the vizier Mentuhotep, a contep, a contemporary of Sesostris I who was both chief lector-priest and priest of the two children of Horus, the latter occurring amongst a catalogue of duties at court that involved responsibility for the royal insignia;49 whilst under the Eighteenth Dynasty the statue of one Teti, a scribe of the divine offerings of Amun, records that he was a priest of the two children of Horus and sem-priest of the pr-dw;t.50 Archaism is detectable in the more recent example from the depiction of the first child as wearing the crown of upper Egypt and the second that of lower Egypt, in apparent reference to Nekhen and Pe respectively. In contrast, the statue of Paser, Copenhagen AEIN 50, shows both children with the northern crown, whilst on Cairo CG 42164 the first child wears the northern crown, and the second is seated upon the lap of a nurse, most probably indicating that the office was now understood to be that of a hnmti-priest, of which the titles are regularly determined in this way.51 Finally, on the statue of Mentuhotep at Buffalo 45 See L.

Texts upon the uncovered shoulders and chests of sculpture in the round seem first to occur under the Twelfth Dynasty, when they are confined to private individuals and record the name of the reigning monarch,54 an apparent reflection of the practice of marking the body as an indication of ownership or dedication.55 Their appearance coincides with that of pectorals bearing pharaonic names, attested both by surviving examples56 and in representation upon statues of the king's family,57 and although deriving from a somewhat different decorative tradition they too were perhaps understood to possess prophylactic qualities.58 Under the Eighteenth Dynasty the fashion found increasing favour,59 exceptionally elaborated by the replacement of the royal name with the name or figure of a god.60 Other than upon statues of Akhenaten, where the presence of the earlier didactic names of the Aten within cartouches on the upper arms and chest continue to 52 0.

Tuthmosis III: Borchardt, op. cit. iv-v, 42 (1057); Legrain, op. cit. 72, p1s. 73 (42I23), 74 (42I24); Amenophis II: Borchardt, op. cit.

Legrain, op. cit. 71, pl. 72 (42122), where on the right shoulder the prenomen of Amenophis I is associated with the name of Amun-Min and on the left the prenomen of Tuthmosis III with that of Khons. That the divine names are here to be understood as royal epithets is perhaps suggested by Legrain, op. cit. 34-5 (42057), where the prenomen of Tuthmosis III is qualified as mry 'Imn; E. Naville and H. R. Hall, The XIth Dynasty Temple at Deir el-Bahari, iii (London, 1913), p1. 5 (3), where the prenomen of Amenophis II is shown on the right shoulder of a scribal statue, whilst on the palette that rests on the left shoulder appears cr;-hprw-rc mry 'Imn. Compare, however, C. Leemans, Aegyptische Monumenten van het Nederlandsche Museum van Oudheden te Leyden II (Leiden, 1844), p1. 4 (Di9). For an early occurrence of the figure of a god (Amun) alone see the statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Horemheb as a scribe: H. E. Winlock, JEA 10 (1924), i; W. C.

Amongst the more conspicuous resumptions by the early Ramessides of forms current in pre-Amarna days is the accordance of divine honours to discrete manifestations of the reigning king both within appropriately named temples, and before colossal statues67 which, similarly qualified by a specific epithet, were supported by individual endowments and the service of their own personnel.68 For the latter, the most direct evidence is afforded by surviving examples which their texts fully designate as (pa) twt r (n), hnty wr n69 or mnw wr followed either by ther by the nomen or prenomen, apparently used indifferently,70 defined by some distinct predicate.

At times more difficult to assess is the employment of an abbreviated designation that, dispensing with the introductory phrase, retains only the royal name and epithet. Thus the epithet hq; t;wy recurs amongst others as the identity of colossi at Abu Simbel72 where, as in general in the inscriptions upon statues themselves and as the accompaniment of their portrayal on votive stelae, this abbreviated formula is preferred, often in reference to an aspect of royalty not elsewhere known to be attested by the use of a complete designation. In these examples the signification of the formula is apparent from its context. It is less so when encountered in isolation upon scarabs that record otherwise unknown epithets, and which a minimal interpretation would regard as simple evocations of some random facet of kingship.73 Since, however, it may happen that conclusive evidence for the existence of an individual cult survives only in the full designation of its statue upon a single scarab,74 and since in recording a far wider range of epithets in the abbreviated formula than within ththe context of full designations scarabs reflect the same convention as is observable upon statues themselves and upon their two- dimensional representation, it seems probable that here too is to be recognized an expression of organized ritual practice. More attenuated still is the occasional reference to a statue by its epithet alone, without identification of the king in whose honour it was erected. In a devotional inscription at Aswan addressed to Khnum by one Minemheb,75 the significance of the latter's title, imy-r kwt n rr n hq , already suggested by the proximity of the granite quarries, is confirmed by the existing colossus at Luxor,76 by depictions with both full and abbreviated designations upon votive stelae from Qantir,77 apparently in reference to a colossus formerly standing there of which fragments, bearing the abbreviated formula, have been identified at Tanis and Bubastis;78 by statues in the Ramesseum79 and at Abu Simbel80 also with 71 Habachi, Features, 17-20. 72 Ibid. 8. 73 An instructive instance is the scarab bearing the inscription h m ntrw in which M. el-Alfi (JEA 58 (1972), 179-8i) has thought to see an abbreviated reference to a statue of this name (itself attested, also in abbreviated form upon a statue at Gerf-Hussein) but which R. Hari (JEA 60 ( 974), 134) questions: 'designe-t-elle vraiment une statue, ou n'est-elle, parmi tant d'autres, qu'un qualificatif du roi qu'on retrouverait aussi bien sur un scarabee que sur une statue, voire sur d'autres monuments?' That in this case the allusion is in fact to a statue is indicated by a mould from Qantir that records the full designation p; twt r; n Rr-ms-sw mry-'Imn hr m ntrw: Khawam, op. cit. 138-9, pl. 32 (12). 74 Pi twt r; n Rr-ms-sw mry 'Imn Mntw m Mn-nfr; p; twt r; n Rr-ms-sw mry 'Imn mrwt mi Pth m Mn-nfr: Khawam, op. cit. 139; pI. 32 (13). 75 Habachi, op. cit. 26. 76 See n. 71 above. 77 Roeder, op. cit. 53; Clere, op. cit. 27-8; Habachi, ASAE 52 (1954), 550; idem, Features, 29-3 I; idem, in S.

In general, these exhibit the king in relation to a deity (mry 'Imn/'Itm/Pth/Sth/Hr/Hjr- 8htyl Dhwti; mrwt mi Pth IPth m Mn-nfr/Dhwti hr b;kf; lh n 'ItmIRrI Sth; s5 Pth); as a god himself (pR ntr) or one in the company of gods (he m ntrw); or announce his political supremacy, either discretely (nb T-sty, hq; hqw; q; tvwy; dsr sfyt) or as the manifestation of some deity (Mntw m t;wy m Mn-nfr; Rr n hqw). This last pair may be regarded as reflecting a totality of royal attributes in terms of antithesis, identical with the warlike aspect of Montu in combat and the beneficent power of Re in triumph and tranquil dominion,85 and are echoed elsewhere by descriptions of Ramesses II as R r. n Kmt,6 Rr n nsyw, shd t;wy mi itn, sw n nsyw,89 w.d bw hr hzswt nb90 and ptpt hswt nb.91 Here, it seems, are appropriate parallels for Paser's inscriptions,92 which on other grounds also have seemed to refer to the king. Some measure of confirmation is the accompanying prenomen in the R-text of Durham N.5 I, which exactly mirrors the abbreviated formula as it is used in reference to the royal cult, whilst in the light of evidence quoted above, their rarity, other than in what is presumably an archaizing source of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, becomes 81 Pap.
