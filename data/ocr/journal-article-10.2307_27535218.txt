<plain_text><page sequence="1">by Charles I. Glicksberg JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH Critic of Despair BOTH as dramatic critic and book reviewer on the Nation and as author of several influential books, Joseph Wood Krutch has won a prominent though disputed position in the field of con temporary American criticism. Whatever one may think of his views, one cannot deny that his work is highly significant. In one form or another, it has touched on nearly all the major critical problems confronting this age. A discussion of his books is there fore bound to include an exposition and appraisal of the leading ideas of our time. I. The Modern Temper admirably summed up the philosophy of defeatism of the muddled and sadly disillusioned post-war gen eration. Obviously, the intellectual atmosphere which Mr. Krutch described was the one held in part or as a whole by many of his contemporaries. He gives coherent and reasoned utterance to what many of them felt in a more or less nebulous, uncertain manner. The book, nevertheless, is primarily an effort at self understanding. It is a personal confession as well as a study of "the modern temper". He can disentangle the nervous complex ities and compulsions of modern thought with commendable clarity, but, as he frankly admits, his analysis of the emotional reaction induced by these tendencies, is "of necessity colored by an individual personality". Even though he endeavors to select for analysis only those emotional attitudes which are typical, his choice as well as his treatment was sure to be biased to some degree by his intellectual preconceptions. For he is concerned not with verifiable observations, but with a state of mind, "and in the effort to describe and account for it I am responsible not for Truth, but for the convictions, scientific or otherwise, which I and</page><page sequence="2">78 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG my contemporaries have been led to hold". What Mr. Krutch evidently means to imply is that he does not have to justify the state of mind of any age; it exists; he is merely recording it. But certainly in recording it?just as if he were tracing a nerve impulse in the laboratory?he is responsible for making veracious observations that can be tested. If his observations are in error, then his conclusions must likewise be wrong. No writer can afford to shirk the responsibility of truth. Mr. Krutch is decidedly unhappy because he has discovered that the world of today is not the same world that has been pictured by thinkers in the past. Evil and good are not clean cut and diametrically opposed; Nature is supremely indifferent to those intrinsically human values which men cherish. How different, he laments, is the world of experience from the world of the heart's desire ! But every intelligent, mature person has to some extent realized the wisdom of curbing his insatiable ego in its demands. As the universe approximates more closely to the conception formed of it by knowledge and experience, so does man grow in strength, understanding, and power. Increase of knowledge not only increases his power to control his physical environment; it also enriches and intensifies his being. The uni verse which his imagination fashioned was but a child's fantasy; now the anthropomorphic universe is transformed into one of which he is only a part, it is true, but a conscious and purposeful part. It is therefore an expression of sentimentalism to assume, as Mr. Krutch does, that in winning this knowledge man has for feited a desirable world for one less desirable to which he must now painfully adapt himself. The truth is otherwise. Mr. Krutch converts science into the serpent that has crept into the Garden of Eden and led man into sin and unhappiness. Poetry and religion, he declares, satisfied man's inner needs; science, on the other hand, is inexorably objective. The two, he concludes, are irreconcilable. Is this really so? Fundamentally, there need be no conflict between the two realms. Mr. Krutch is emotionally swayed by his nostalgia for the certitudes and absolutes of the traditional past. He speaks with despair of the cold immensities of space and the chaos of nature, unaware that he is employing value-freighted metaphors. He is equally sub</page><page sequence="3">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 79 jective when he declares that Nature's purpose (if she possess one) is not the purpose of man. "Her desire merely to live and to propagate in innumerable forms, her ruthless indifference to his values, and the blindness of her irresistible will strike terror to his soul, and he comes in the fullness of his experience to realize that the ends which he proposes to himself?happiness and order and reason?are ends which he must achieve, if he achieve them at all, in her despite." This is eloquent but fallacious. Nature is neither friend nor foe. Wisely controlled, and science is the best instrument of control human ingenuity has so far advised, she aids man in fulfilling his purpose. Ignorantly opposed, she causes his destruction. Scientific knowledge may not give shelter and protection to our pet ideals and illusions, neither does it con ceive of Nature as a sinister, implacable enemy. If science proves the death of many values once held sacred, what does that mean but that those values were not fitted to endure? Values are, after all, relative and contingent; they must be in a universe of flux. But values of some sort man will always create and pre serve. His egoism may suffer and dwindle; he may not secure the benediction of allpowerful gods; he may discern no plan in the universe about him; yet his human world will continue to be rich and varied, purposeful and absorbing. Life will then be more complex and adventurous, more rational and satisfying because it will be stripped of the veil of illusions which the mythopoeic fancy of historic man has drawn across the sky of knowledge and thought. There is no knowledge man cannot bear. Man's illusion of cosmic importance naturally decreases, but is it not assuming too much to say that he is left more and more alone in the universe? He is no more alone now than he was a thousand years ago. Mr. Krutch will reply that human desire is more essential than scientific truth. His indictment of science is primarily on the ground that the knowledge it assembles and works into a pattern has no bearing on human needs. Whatever truth science may discover, he asserts, man must live according to certain established standards of conduct. Since man is an ethical animal, neither he nor society can long exist without re ference to some fixed and stable moral order. Science, it seems, has destroyed this, "man's most fundamental myth". Yet even</page><page sequence="4">80 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG if the universe contains no ethical element, no hint of a categorical imperative, even if that fundamental myth should die out, man can still formulate and abide by a rationally satisfying con struction of ethics. Emotionally, man cannot as yet successfully adjust himself to the dynamic world which science presents and which it assures him is real. That, however, is no argument against science. Man must make the adjustment, and in time he will. The cultural lag does not justify retrogression or de featism. If, as Mr. Krutch puts it, man finds no answer to his questions and no fulfillment of his needs in a world of electrons and complexes, science can justly reply: The function of science is not to provide salvation. It is not a religion but an organized body of knowledge based on experiment and observation. In asking science to supply what is not its proper concern, you wish to make of it a form of mysticism. Science appeals to the in tellect, not to the emotions. It aims to achieve truth, not to satisfy man's egocentric wishes. Nevertheless, Mr. Krutch, like many serious thinkers before him, persists in asking the query: What is to be done? How shall man live? He cannot arrive at any positive and robust af firmation of faith because his mind is untrammeled by theological delusions, because he knows that not every problem humanity posits is necessarily solvable. Having gone thus far, he indulges in dismal speculations on the survival possibilities of human beings. The predicament he describes so vividly is essentially a personal predicament, peculiar to a highly trained and sensitive intellect; it is not the predicament of the race as a whole. Man does not find fault with the earth which bore him; the knowledge that his disappearance would not interfere in the least with the physical processes of the universe does not vitally concern him because his hunger for immortality is not so overdeveloped. The picture Mr. Krutch draws of the future is lugubrious and fantastic?a future in which only those who found no lack in nature would reign supreme. "Cured of his transcendental cravings, content with things as they are, accepting the universe as experience has shown it to be, man would be freed of his soul and, like the other animals, either content or at least desirous of nothing which he might not hope ultimately to obtain." Science is thus convicted of having</page><page sequence="5">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 81 failed to serve man or reconcile his conflicts. Man is faced with a task of readjustment more stupendous than any made before; if this is not possible, the human spirit, we are told, will face ex tinction. Mr. Krutch is himself his own best critic. When intelligence, he writes, "is detached, it not only tends to paralyze natural im pulses by criticizing natural aims, but develops certain intellectual virtues which are biologic vices". A choice, he insists, must be made between an existence essentially animal in character and one which aspires to purely human values. Yet, to accept the latter choice is dangerous. Races, like individuals, fall victims to their humanity. When they discover that life has no purpose, they shrivel into nothingness. In a revealing passage he declares: "Hence it is that many a man with trained mind, developed sen sibilities, and even as much good will toward society as can be expected of a creature who has lost the animal's innate talent for caring more for his race than for himself, stands paralyzed in the midst of a world that has learned so many things which do not help it toward any ultimate solution of its problems, but which tend, on the contrary, rather to make him suspect that they are insoluble. These men cannot strive with a missionary zeal for the development and spread of pure science, philosophy, and art because they have come to believe that these things are neither ul timately satisfying nor conducive to a vigorous national life." This quotation is important both in its personal implications and as a preliminary statement of the theme that emerges in Was Europe a Success?, his most recent book. Perhaps the most significant chapter in The Modern Temper is the one entitled "The Tragic Fallacy", which attempts to show that we no longer write tragedies in the dramatic or any other form because the human spirit has grown enfeebled. Man has lost, we are told, the ability to impose upon the welter of life a pattern of meaning which would satisfy his metaphysical hunger. Today the soul of man is portrayed as commonplace; whereas, according to Mr. Krutch, the idea of tragedy is invariably as sociated with the idea of nobility. Tragedy presupposes faith in the importance of man and his life on earth. The tragic writer must believe in humanity, for such a belief reconciles man to his 6</page><page sequence="6">82 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG fate. That Mr. Krutch is largely wrong in his premises and con clusions, which rest on a pathetic fallacy, has been demonstrated by Mr. Mark Harris in the book, The Case for Tragedy. Aside from the mental atmosphere, the sociological conditions of an age and place stressed by Mr. Harris as relevant for an interpretation of the tragic spirit in literature, is it true that man must be made to seem great enough to justify the portrayal of tragic suffering? If we do not tell tales of the fall of princes, it is not that we do do not believe that they exist, but that we would invest all men, no matter how humble in origin or low in the economic scale, with the inherent human dignity, that quality of nobility which Mr. Krutch finds essential for the creation of tragedy. He feels that tragedy can stalk by only in sceptered pomp and royal robes; the critics with naturalistic leanings know that it can wear the rags of a beggar and the mud-caked jeans of an old degenerate tobacco farmer. Tobacco Road and Beyond the Horizon are funda mentally as tragic in expression, though not derived from the same tradition, as the tragedies by Sophocles and Shakespeare. A religious yearning, disguised and at times even suspicious of itself, is at the heart of Mr. Krutch's writings. His exacting and skeptical intelligence repudiates the demands made by this chan neled mystical libido, but his inner emotional self intensely craves the certitude and consolation, the definite meaning and purpose, however illusory, it imposes on life. Even his system of aesthetics is conditioned by this spiritual conflict. Art, he believes, suggests a realm of peace. It provides a medicine for the sickness of the spirit; it pictures a world which is perfect and entirely acceptable. But art is based on order, while to found life on art is to end in anarchy. Thus art may "furnish a means by which life may be contemplated, but not a means by which it may be lived". Art, in short, is contemplation, not action. Aesthetics can give no answer to the riddle man's questioning intellect propounds. The affirmations of art are ethically and empirically without value? a point of view more elaborately developed in his book, Ex perience and Art. To sum up the arguments advanced in The Modern Temper: In pursuing the phantom of certitude, Mr. Krutch has small re gard for the extraordinary progress of science and for the major</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 83 efforts of civilization in taming and controlling nature for the benefit of mankind. He is opposed to the mechanical progress and the static materialism of bourgeois society because they have de prived him of the sense of playing a central r?le in the cosmic drama. Science, he maintains, is chiefly responsible for reducing man to his present state of comparative insignificance. This, in truth, is the psychological foundation of modern despair?the rationalization that man is but a floating atom in an infinite void. Mr. Krutch seems to look with favor on a system of metaphysics which has cut itself off from the regnant assumptions of science? a system which will start with the dualistic belief that the world of the spirit is entirely different from that of nature, and that the mind must be permitted to seek its truth without outside aid. Let us note to what this logically leads. It culminates in the as if philosophy of vital illusions. Metaphysics, by a declara tion of independence, is to develop in defiance of and in opposition to natural science. Mr. Krutch would thus divorce thought from physiology and morality from its genetic historical origins. He would establish a dualism that would spell the doom of scientific investigation?and all this in the name of escaping from material ism. Since biology and physics have waxed strong at the expense of aesthetics and religion, he recommends that we substitute spiritual and moral values which would be useful to both the in dividual and society. If we accept these "logically" tenable cer titudes and abide by them as if they were true, we shall find that they will work. Life is thus to be established on a beneficent fiction. In this way, we are assured, eternal values would be re captured and life become an art. Once the dualism between man and nature had been revived, the belief in immortality, an external moral order, and so on, would return. This is the metaphysical faith offered as a cure for the modern "distemper". Yet Mr. Krutch doubts whether such fictions could ever be used to live by. Even his metaphysics ends in confirmatory despair. II. Mr. Krutch is among the few critics who, in a period of pro found social and political change, have kept their poise and de tachment, refusing to be swept along in the turbulent current of</page><page sequence="8">84 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG sociological criticism. He is also exceptional in that, far from using his criticism as a springboard for political or social propa ganda or any special doctrine not implicit in literature itself, he formulated a comprehensive philosophy of literary criticism?a system of aesthetics which, whether right or wrong, has the su preme virtue, at least, of being clearly defined; he is free from besetting dogmas or intellectual preconceptions. His is a re markably independent intelligence; analytical, dispassionate, rarely, if ever, resorting to worn-out counters of rhetoric. In Experience and Art, which is concerned primarily with the aesthetics of literature, Mr. Krutch states his fundamental premises. He is not given, to extremes, he does not indulge in hard-and-fast generalizations. He notes tendencies, trends; re maining at the same time keenly aware of exceptions, subtle dis tinctions, important qualifications. He steers clear of the fallacy which assumes that since art is enormously important to the cul ture of a race, it is therefore to be identified indiscriminately with some social or ethical philosophy. Literature for him is not a record of fact; it has no covenant with literal truth; it is, on the contrary, the expression of everything man is capable of believing. Once a work of art is born, it may awaken experiences similar to those in the realm of nature, but the two types of experience, he feels, are not and cannot be the same. Art is the intellectual and spiritual dwelling-place of man. If this be granted, does it not follow, he argues, that "Literature is not a psychological purge any more than it is a sociological treatise"? Though he has written a biographical study of Poe in which he employs the psychoanalytical method, he is averse to the con fusion of thought involved in making psychoanalysis a substitute for literary criticism. Literary creations have in them, he be lieves, some elements of the dream or reverie, but what distin guishes the two, as even some of the less fanatical disciples of Freud have conceded, is that the creative process possesses the quality of communicability. It extends beyond the subjective frontiers of the creator. Hence Mr. Krutch derides the crass simpli fications of the psychologists who fashion an all-inclusive critical system that at best can explain only psychological or infantile states. Even if one believed that Art is man-made and therefore</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 85 conditioned by human desires and limitations, it is unjustifiable to conclude that all literature is the product of a day-dream or a neurosis. Art exists to satisfy human needs, and imaginative truth is achieved when these needs are most amply fulfilled. In this way Mr. Krutch exposes the shortcomings of a movement which for a time had a considerable vogue and which threatened to mislead many critics with its pretentious pseudo-scientific jargon about inferiority complexes and incest motives. Mr. Krutch argues that since Nature has no ideological design ?since it is devoid of any discernible intention or purpose? literature provides an admirable substitute for Nature; it exalts man to a plane of freedom; it sets him within the pulsating center of a life that is harmonious and beautifully consistent and organi cal y justified: it elevates him to an ideal realm created and made possible by the exercise of the human imagination. In this ideal realm, whether it be one of comedy or tragedy, not only are events selected but there is a temporary suspension of the laws or ordinary probability. From this Mr. Krutch proceeds to the deduction that as a tradition of art gains in perfection it also gains in artificiality, thus accepting with certain reservations the critical belief of Charles Lamb that Restoration drama was not to be judged by ordinary rules of taste since it inhabited a world of make-be'ieve, a gracious world of glamorous fictions where moral laws were abrogated and necessity knew no bounds. Mr. Krutch here ignores the patent truth that no tradition, no hypothetical construction, could long thrive if it were not rooted in, if it did not grow out of, the social life and needs of a people within a particular milieu and age. Art may confirm a convention; it does not originate it. If human nature is conservative, so is human society. If the latter is constantly subjected to the pressure of change, so is the former. There is really no human norm; there is but a succession of norms in conformity with the altered social and economic con ditions of a land. Mr. Krutch admits "that the motives and aims behind literary experiment usually correspond with those which are determining the direction of the social evolution contemporary with them". But that is as far as he will consent to go. Yet if literature is not exempt from life, if it is not a pale distant re</page><page sequence="10">86 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG flection, a remote and idealized entity, it cannot be regarded as the area of calm within the storm but as the storm itself, rendered in all its elemental fury and violence. It may be more "ideal" than Nature but it is not therefore "artificial" or opposed to Nature. If it is vital art, it shares the nature which is common to both Nature and Man. Hence life does not, as Mr. Krutch seems to feel, imitate art anywhere to the same extent that art imitates life. In driving home his thesis that life follows art, that man enjoys experiences, tastes love and faces death in a manner learned from and reminiscent of books, Mr. Krutch concludes that the patterns established by novelists and poets and dramatists profoundly modify "if not the universe in which we live?then at least the emphasis of our attention upon certain parts of it and determine to no small degree both what the universe shall look like and which of our feelings we shall be most keenly aware of". This, however, presents a puzzling problem. For, if a literary work exercises a pronounced ideological and emotional effect at any given time, exactly why does it do so? What are the ascer tainable factors which make for the "successful" inoculation of one type of work to the exclusion and failure of another? WThy, for example, does a post-war generation welcome a Scott Fitz gerald and a Hemingway and a Faulkner? Why does a certain school of realistic novelists arise within a particular epoch? It would be absurd to argue that "fellow travellers" like Cecil Day Lewis and Stephen Spender in England will make the British public Marx-conscious or proletarian-conscious. On the contrary, they are published and given a hearing because they emerge at a psychological and historical juncture when a hunger for social justice is powerfully making itself felt. Society has given birth both to the poet and his audience. Without the impact of wide spread unemployment and economic distress, without the menace of communism and fascism, such writers would have no readers and what is more, little enough incentive to write. Mr. Krutch practically grants that this is so when he declares that literary schools, "like those of the Renaissance, of Classicism, and of Romanticism, correspond to crises in the development of the hu man consciousness", which determine how people are going to act and what they will feel. Still, he maintains that it is of no</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 87 particular importance whether the artist first discovered and clearly formulated the new sentiment or whether he expressed it in response to a deeply felt need of his age. Mr. Krutch is a philosophical idealist. According to him, man cannot know the inherent and ultimate nature of reality; man can but translate the vertiginous flux of phenomena into mental terms ?a translation which implies, of course, some degree of distortion. Hence the sense of illusion in life so that even the feeling which Art provides of getting profoundly in touch with the heart of reality is also a pure illusion. For this urbane but remorseless critic, the only way out of this wild ebb and flow of time is con templation, the arresting of some object or event into a symbol, into art. This philosophy of illusion makes him realize more poignantly the need for convictions of some sort, either creative or critical, if writing is to be fully effective. But for him, the perception of flux and change in life, the perception that there are no final but only relative and provisional truths, prevents the utterance of any passionate belief. He is passionate only in the reiteration of unbelief; he almost achieves an impressive kind of eloquence when he voices a skepticism so absolute that it leads to despair. Whatever convictions he may hold, his central belief is that no enduring convictions are possible. This is without question his salient weakness and handicap as a critic. He lacks passion and force and the power to stimulate and inspire because his libidinal life is under too severe control, because fundamentally he believes in nothing and is capable only of unsparing dissection, rigorous analysis. He can negate persuasively; he has not the gift for making heartening affirmations. He heads no school of thought now; he has no followers; he advocates no cause; he is curiously aloof from the problems and perturbations of the con temporary scene. His theory of criticism is strikingly in accord with his philoso phy of illusion. Criticism, he insists, is at best a highly indi vidual art, which differs from person to person. There are no absolute standards; value is always relative "not only to the individual, but to the stage which he has reached in his indi vidual development". From relativity of judgment there is no escape unless one sets up some arbitrary norm. Yet he demands</page><page sequence="12">88 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG that the critic acquires the qualities of relative detachment and objectivity. Though judgment of art is influenced by the ex periences and temperament of the critic he must strive "for some sort of objectivity, for some degree of detachment"; he must avoid the evils of arbitrary impressionism and plain dogmatism. When criticism deals with a particular work, it should replace general theories with discrimination. Finally, the critic, while retaining his state of detachment, may attempt to judge a work by what Mr. Krutch calls its "functional effectiveness"; that is, to see how well it carries out its aesthetic intention. Even then the critic fails to be wholly impersonal. To avoid the pitfalls and con tradictions of a frankly impressionistic criticism such as was practised by Anatole France, Mr. Krutch believes that the critic must sternly endeavor "not to cultivate too extravagantly the idiosyncratic", he must determine to keep "as close as one can to the mind of the author and to concern oneself as far as possible with those associations which appear to be common to a consider able number of persons". A work of art, however, can never be completely judged for what it is in itself. The critic must steadfastly guard against allow ing his political and moral convictions to influence his opinions. That is all he can do. In a sentence which serves as a key to his position as a critic, Mr. Krutch declares: "We can ask only that the critic shall be aware of the personal nature of his reactions as well of the arbitrary character of his standards, and that, just in proportion as he fails to maintain an absolute detachment, he will cultivate that underlying skepticism which softens the dogmatism from which we cannot escape so long as we undertake to say any thing at all." Mr. Krutch is so wary of yielding to the personal influence that he hides himself behind a masked exterior of austere and impenetrable reserve. In his struggle to maintain an absolute detachment, he loses that moral appeal, that personal strength, that power to rouse and elevate and lead which is the distinguish ing feature of Mr. Van Wyck Brooks' writing. He cultivates his constitutional skepticism with such zeal that in his books on criticism and literature, his weekly reviews of current plays in the Nation, one seems to detect a brain speaking and reasoning; the force of conviction that springs from some sustaining faith is conspicuously absent.</page><page sequence="13">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 89 Plis criticism and his philosophy are both overshadowed by a doubt which he cannot drive away. He is caught in a cruel di lemma: he must seek for faith in an age when faith is impossible, and for unity in a universe that seems alien, meaningless, and disruptive. The multiplicity of knowledge, the discoveries of science, the growth of the analytical spirit, these disturb him acutely if they do not cause him dismay, for they destroy the possibility of creating a harmonious world through art. He thus inherits the sickness and maladjustments of the contemporary world. The times are out of joint! Is it really so? Cannot art take over what is humanly and creatively valuable from the achievements of science and trans form them into the vision, the wisdom, the distilled beauty of art? It is only that the advance made by science is so recent and so prodigious that it overwhelms us and that it seems impossible to reconcile it with art. The point need not be labored. The whole problem has been discussed and argued cogently by Mr. Max Eastman in his book, The Literary Mind. While the critics falter and ponder, the writers are busily engaged in absorbing and utilizing the materials of the world about them. The Paradise Lost of the future will portray a radically different cosmology, different aims and ends, different ideals and values and aspirations from those expressed in Milton's epic. It is absurd to argue that these elements will not be there, for life as well as art presupposes af firmation. While man lives he creates, he imposes some kind of unity on the world of experience, and the artist merely carries this to a further and more perfect stage of beauty and unification. Whether this aesthetic unity is as satisfying as the one fashioned by a Dante or a Shakespeare or a Milton is, after all, a question that cannot be answered. We need not sigh for the certitudes of the past. Certitude may give way to reasoned skepticism, faith to scientific awareness, a supernaturally sanctioned affirmation to sane and tested convictions, but it is a form o? romanticism to maintain with Mr. Krutch that this skepticism, this awareness, these convictions are less fortifying and potent influences than the prelogical absolutes of the past. Belief need not be absolute in order that life may have meaning and purpose; analysis may dis integrate religious values, it does not invalidate the necessity for</page><page sequence="14">90 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG belief as a way of life. In fact, it paves the way for a more ac ceptable and more lasting kind of faith. The threnody over the advent of science, the cry for some artificially nurtured and saving illusion?this is of sentimentalism all compact, a sentimentalism no different in quality from that which decries our machine civili zation. Is there any reason why "some passionate faith inclusive enough to give form either to living or to contemplation" cannot arise in our contemporary society? Surely it is no myth to believe that with the rapid education of the great mass of people, science will succeed in formulating a rationally and empirically acceptable unity which will be more than a satisfying fiction, which will be in harmony with the substance of experience. Poetic faith, that is to say, will yield to a faith which is neither poetic nor scientific but which embraces both, and only that type of literature will survive which provides satisfactions that are both true and human and not merely wish-fulfillments. If, in the past, literature and philosophy could furnish a way of life, what ground is there for assuming that they will be unable to do so now? Science is cer tainly not the enemy of art. If the two cannot mix and breed, the reason is that art, hampered by a narrow tradition, refuses to accept the challenge of modernity. III. Modern life, Mr. Krutch admits, has its compensations, but he finds that it is too fragmentary to be fully satisfying. There are gross contradictions, in what we affirm and in what we deny, in the flow of our experiences and the nature of our expression. And contemporary art reflects this disjointed state. Life can be seen steadily but it has lost seemingly forever its wholeness. Inferior to the past in its religion and literature and art, the modern age excels only in scientific and industrial instrumentalities, and faith in them appears to be the only existent available faith. Mr. Krutch cannot discover the presence of grace and faith in the present; its philosophy is inarticulate, its poetry both unintelligible and uninspiring. This world of speed and steel, of power and profits exists "only upon the periphery of consciousness". It. is, he feels, a life of instincts, not contemplation, a world not yet</page><page sequence="15">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 91 shaped by Art, a world raw and undisciplined, without symbols and without realization. Contemporary literature has failed be cause it did not carry conviction. Literature without the aid of philosophy and religion is doomed, he declares, and modern litera ture is, like modern man, "doubtful, divided, eclectic, and experi mental ... It has given us no self-justifying image because its creators have achieved no self-justifying vision". What he craves is justification as well as full of knowledge, faith as well as science, beauty and unity as well as excitement and variety. That is why in his book, Five Masters : A Study in the Mutation of the Novel, which came out two years before Experience and Art, he is seen at his best. His sensitive critical faculties can test their strength and insight on the major figures of a grand and gracious past that is happily remote from the social confusion and economic distress of the contemporary world. Through five novelists?Boccaccio, Cervantes, Richardson, Stendhal, and Proust?representative of the culture and conditions of their age, he is enabled to draw a portrait of that age as well as to trace the evolution of literary forces in time. In the book, Was Europe a Success?, Mr. Krutch advanced a number of theories which clearly indicated his position in the battle between the literary radicals and those who wish to elimi nate politics and economics from critical discussion. He fears that the destruction of capitalism would also involve the ruin of those cultural values which it had taken centuries to develop. The triumph of the social revolution would threaten the existence of individualism and freedom, and especially that disinterestedness which Matthew Arnold so highly praised. Hence, as an in tellectual, Mr. Krutch is inclined to support capitalism. In this age of ranting political passions, he is concerned to salvage those virtues of reason, detachment, and tolerance which dogmatic com munism tends to overthrow. In opposition to Marxist critics like Michael Gold and Granville Hicks, he is bent on separating litera ture and politics, of eliminating extraneous elements from criti cism. Was Europe a Success? is a sober declaration of faith by a liberal, though Mr. Malcolm Cowley, of the New Republic, holds that "his argument is a defense of inequality and injustice on the ground that the suffering of the masses makes possible the</page><page sequence="16">92 by CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG culture and disinterestedness of those who rule over them". What some of these left-wing reviewers demand is that Krutch, who is interested primarily in criticism and not in politics, should join actively in the fight against fascism. They forget that he hates dictatorships of any kind, that he is a sincere lover of freedom for all people, and that to ask him to agitate for Sacco and Vanzetti, for Tom Mooney and the Scottsboro boys is to ask him to do that which is no part of his business as a critic. In a debate, printed in The Forum, between Joseph Wood Krutch and Edmund Wilson on the subject, "Is Politics Ruining Art?" the former patiently undertook to explain his point of view. He announced that though the world was in a sad state of po litical and economic confusion, he could see no logic in dropping the task for which he was best fitted in order to turn himself into an amateur politician. Skeptical of all dogmas, all appeals which seek to override the voice of reason, he refuses to be intimidated by the tactics of the communist critics. He does not deny that there is injustice in the world, that suffering of all kinds is wide spread, that the poor are oppressed, but he does not draw from this the conclusion that the pursuit of poetry and criticism, meta physics and science is a wasted, shameful form of self-indulgence at this juncture of events. Though the night approaches?indeed, because it is already night?it behooves the critic and the artist to attend to their legitimate affairs, to snatch some good out of the flood of time. "The world has always been unjust as well as uncertain. Society has never encouraged any of the things most worth doing and there has never been a time when a really tender conscience could have permitted itself to bother with abstractions or beauty." It is too bad that such things exist, but the artist does his share in making the world more tolerable, more livable. Detachment, Mr. Krutch repeats, is essential for the critic as well as for the creative worker. Though the world is imperfect and life is transitory, man is justified in devoting himself to the creation of beauty that will endure and to the shaping of thoughts that will delight and enlighten mankind. In reply to Mr. Wilson he main tains that the literary man has a perfect right to occupy himself with politics, but that the writer is also justified in ignoring politics and that his work does not therefore suffer in value.</page><page sequence="17">JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH 93 Mr. Krutch, it can be seen, has been deeply influenced by the philosophy of Vaihinger who holds that external reality is con ceivable only in terms of an as if construction. Mr. Krutch finds this philosophy to his purpose, for it seems to prove that science, too, like art, is an aggregation of metaphorical analogies and as sumptions. Hence, if literature and civilization as a whole are products shaped by the imagination, "then it is obviously the first duty of contemporary society to rescue itself from the nihilism into which it seems to be drifting by putting its imagination to work and by proclaiming some series of 'as ifs' according to which it will live." Here then is the secret of his inner longing, the withheld affirmation at last. Science is apparently not enough; the imagination must get busy and create a new world myth, a new all-inclusive faith, a world of satisfying values. But the will to believe is not enough either, nor the perception that belief is necessary. The critical work of Mr. Krutch, however valuable in itself, will not aid in that consummation. The question remains: the will to believe in what? What kind of faith? It remains to be seen whether great art cannot arise from convictions stripped of illusion, cannot be born in a world that relies on and is con trolled by science.</page></plain_text>
