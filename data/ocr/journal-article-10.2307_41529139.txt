<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Amphitryon Theme Again The theme of Amphitryon has deserved and received extensive and detailed study by contemporary scholars. I shall mention here only The transformations of Am- phitryon by Oijan Lindberger, published in Stockholm in 1956, also in the same year in TAPhA the article by L. R. Shero, Alcmena and Amphitryon in ancient and modern drama (!), and, more recently, a chapter by C. O. N. Costa in Roman Drama. Critical Essays on Roman Literature (2). In spite of these thorough studies, I think that there is scope for further analysis. It is my intention to discuss one aspect which has been somehow neglected, namely the character of Jupiter and his role in the economy of the play. I shall trace his avatars through the most out- standing plays on the Amphitryon theme and to Shero's long list of versions (fifty- five in fact) I want to add another (the fifty- sixth) written by a Brazilian author, Guilherme Figueiredo. Plautus' Amphitryo is the natural point of departure. The Latin writer received the myth of Amphitryon and the birth of Hercules from Greece. There is early evidence of the popularity of the theme. Homer and Hesiod mention Alcmena. So does Aspls. Pherekydes, an Athenian genealogist of the Vth century, deals with the story of Zeus and Alcmena In the extant fragment Alcmena refuses to consummate her marriage with Amphitryon until he has avenged the death of her brother, and Amphitryon takes to the field to fight the Teleboians. The same night Zeus comes disguised to Amphitryon's house ; he "tells Alcmena what happened during the bat- tle and gives her a bowl which he claims to have received as a victor's prize. The version is close to Plautus' plot but the tale seems to lack the confusion of per- sonalities which is of central importance in the Latin play. We know of an Am- phitryon by Sophocles and Alcmenai by Aeschilus and by Euripides. The theme had been treated also in comedy, and Rhinton, the best known writer of phylacographies or hilaro-comedies, is stated to have been the author of an Am- phitryon (3). (1) Vol. 89, p. 192-238.

Despite the vastly developed confrontation between Mercurius and Sosia, Plautus' plot concentrates on the interaction of Jupiter, Amphitruo and Alcumena, and he makes things sim- pler for us when Mercurius, in the prologue, announces a tragi-comeodia (6) (not a hilaro- tragedy). The primary element for comedy is the fact that two persons can be confused with two others and Plautus exploits this situation extensively (' ). But at the same time the position of the characters is too high for them to be mere objects of ridicule ; their dignity must be preserved. Alcumena is clearly not meant to be a comic figure and her style has its closest counterpart in Greek tragedy (8). Besides, adultery is not lightly considered in Rome and Plautus treats skilfully such a dangerous topic (9). He succeeds in keeping the difficult balance between tragedy and comedy. A short survey of the religious situation in which this play was written may help to make clearer Jupiter's role. Historians agree that the Second Punic War provoked a religious crisis in Rome (10). The common citizen, threatened by the in- vasion and the victories of Hannibal, turned to the supernatural power for protec- tion and felt that the Roman gods were incapable of placating the divine fury. Con- sequently there was an imperious need for new cults and rites. The Roman Pan- theon was enriched by Greek divinities, Etruscan religious practices became widespread, and the innumerable numina of primitive times were relegated to the shade. Besides, the old beliefs "no longer corresponded to the intellectual and social condition of the people. Having nothing to put in their place, the Romans (4) " Le don d'inventer des fables manque au genie latin. Ses mythes sont restes rudimentaires". Marie Delcourt, Plaute et /' impartiality comique , Bruxelles, 1964, p. 61. (5) F. Leo, Plautinische Forschungen zur Kritik und Geschichte der Komodie , Berlin, 1895, p. 155.

"Davantage, ce nom de tragi -corned ie, qui apparalt ici semble-t- il, pour la premiere fois et qui etait promis a une si grande fortune, il nous plait que ce soit Plaute qui Pait forge, en contradiction avec la rigueur aristotelicienne de la distinction des genres et ses criteres a la fois moraux et formels". Delcourt, op. cit ., p. 86. (7) In one of his most richly pregnant sentences, Jung said "The gods are the libido". Since it ex- presses the masculine desire to possess another man's virtuous and beautiful wife without offending her or killing him, Amphitryon is the perfect libidinous burlesque comedy. It inspired many imitations - for instance by Dryden and Moliere ; and finally, in Amphitryon 38 by Jean Giraudoux, it rose high above burlesque and satire into the heaven of pure comedy".

Although the Romans had several manifestations of Jupiter, such as the Capitoline, of Etruscan origin, their Latin Jupiter had little in common with the Hellenic Zeus. He was not the supreme god to whom all the others were subor- dinated, but just another god among peers, acting like the others, within his own sphere. Only Hellenism gave Jupiter omnipotence (12). The introduction of this new Jupiter was hastened, to a large extent, by the popularity of Greek tragedy and comedy and the presence in Rome of refugees from Campania and Southern Italy. In Rome the worship of Jupiter became more and more the supreme cult and the symbol of the State (13). Religion is not alien to Plautus' plays ; it is frequently present in the words and thought of his characters. But Amphitruo is an isolated comedy in the repertoire of the Roman palliata because the gods are actually on stage ("). The idea of making the Gods play a burlesque role is not shocking to the religious feelings of An- tiquity (15). Gods are treated quite disrespectfully and "irreverence is endemic" in Roman comedy as Segal declares (16). This familiar approach and sincere worship do not seem incompatible (! 7 ). The Roman mind seems undisturbed by such in- congruity. J. P. Cebe states : "Les divinites greco-romaines sont joyeuses et taquines, elles ont 'le sens de I'humour' ; elles se divertissent meme des brocards dont elles font les frais, pourvu que le railleur ne soit pas anime detentions sacrileges. Avec elles, il est loisible, et en cer- taines circonstances prescrit, de plaisanter librement" (IS). (11) Albert Grenier. The Roman spirit in religion, thought and art , London, 1962, p. 154.

In the prologue, Mer- curius declares that Jupiter must be feared and venerated by the mortals. Pater hue me misit ad uos oratum mens, Tametsi pro imperio uobis quod dictum foret Scibat facturos, quippe qui intellexerat Vereri uos se et metuere, ita ut aequum est Iouem. (20-23) Yet two lines later, Jupiter himself is fearful of some evil. Born of human parents, he is also humanly vulnerable. Etenim ille cuius hue iussu uenio Juppiter Non minus quam uostrum quiuis formidat malum : Humana matre natus, humano patre, Mirari non est aequom, sibi si praetimet (26-29) Mercurius, emphathetically, joins his father in his apprehensions. Atque ego quoque etiam, qui Iouis sum filius, Contagione mei patris metuo malis, (30-31) Shortly afterwards this timorous Mercurius reminds his audience of his and his father's good deeds. Debetis uelle quae uelimus : meruimus et ego et pater de uobis et re publico. (39-40) Jupiter is the deorum regnator and the architectus of kindness (21), and he is also a judge who passes a verdict. Sirempse legem iussit esse Juppiter, quasi magistratum sibi alteriue ambiuerit. (73-74) (19) "... Jupiter qui decidement prend gout a son role d' horn me". B. Taladoire, Essai sur le comique de Plaute , Monaco, 1956, p. 90. (20) Galinksy sees in this tragi-comedia a continual interaction between the divine and the human protagonists", bp. cil , p. 215. This cannot be denied, but the reader should keep in mind that the play is more complex because both Jupiter and Amphitruo have features in common. Jupiter stoops to human level quite overtly and Amphitruo's portrayal reaches a heroic, almost divine stature. Galinsky himself acknowledges that "... At the play's end, Amphitruo is promised to be graced with immortal i gloria, and thus the human and divine levels again are intermingled". Ib., p. 232. (21) Pl., Amph ., 45. Mercurius also affirms his own divinity (1, 53), but he seems forgetful of his powers. Sed ego stultior quasi nesciam uos uelle, qui diuus siem. (57-58) This shifting attitude reflects Jupiter's dual role.</page><page sequence="5">878 A. C. ROMANO But this respectable magistrate has become an actor, a not particularly honorable profession in Roman eyes ("). Mirari nolim uos, quapropter Juppiter Nunc histriones caret. Ne miremini : Ipse banc ac turns t Juppiter comoediam. (86-88) After this captatto beneuolentiae , rich in fluctuations and contradictions, Mercurius recalls his father's propensity to fall in love and his unrestrained behaviour on those occasions C23). Following this encounter with Sosia, Mercurius reassures the audience by revealing the outcome of the play (24) and he defines what is the fair and responsible attitude of the gods towards mortals. ... nam deum Non par uidetur facere, delictum suum Suamque ut culpam expetere in mortalem ut sinat. (493-495) But in the meantime, Jupiter is a scitus sycophanta (25), who should be fearful of Juno's jealousy (26). Plautus carries this anthropomorphic treatment of the gods to the point of presenting Jupiter threatened by his irate wife, a clear extrapolation of the power of the uxores dotatae in Rome to the divine world. This king of the gods, disguised as Amphitruo, after usurping the marital rights of the latter, recovers some dignity when he dismisses the Night: Nunc te, Nox, quae me mansisti, mitto ut concedas die. (546) (22) The argument that Jupiter had previously appeared on stage is rather feeble, since there is a distance between a divine intervention as a last resource and a god who becomes a theatrical character. "He (Plautus) turns everything topsy-turvy. In one instance even the Gods are die lasses. Jove and Mer- cury stoop to become mere actors, a group ranked so low in everyday society that they were denied even the basic rights of citizenship". "And. Mercury not only assumes the face and features of Sosia the slave, but, subsequently receives the tongue-lashing and threats of more physical lashing that typify the lot of Plautine bondsmen". Segal, op. c/t, p. 101. According to Guilbert, Mercury embodies the parasite of the Menandrean tradition. "Chez Menan- dre ... revolution du type est telle que le parasite, entierement vide de I'idee pique-assietique, n'est plus que le serviteur galant", op cit p. 57. (23) PL., Amph.s 104-106.

Edepol ne ilia si istis rebus te sciat operant dare, Ego faxim ted Amphitruonem esse maiis quam louem.</page><page sequence="6">THE AMPHITRYON THEME AGAIN 879 Later in the play when Amphitruo discovers Alcumena's unwitting infidelity, he is in the depths of misery and indignation. Perii miser, quia pudicitia huius me hie absente est additum, (810-811) Alcumena, on her side, wonders what prompted the calumnies of which she is the object. Quid ego feci, quae istaec propter dicta dicantur mihi? (815) She swears per supremi regis regnum et matrem familias Iunonem ( 27 ) which makes the dramatic irony even more intricate ; there follows her profession of faith in women's decorum , a recitation of the attributes of a Roman matron (28). Not a doubt crosses Alcumena's mind and, self-assured, she confidently defies her ac- cusers (29). Amphitruo's wife, unaware culprit, blinded by her own innocence, ap- proaches the level of a tragic heroine caught between forces beyond her control (so). Alcumena's resentment and Amphitruo's jealousy are bound to be deadlocked. Only a deus ex machina could bridge the estrangement of the couple (31), and Jupi- ter, abandoning his human role, reassumes his divinity and introduces himself quite unpretentiously (32). Ego sum ille Amphitruo ... in superiore qui habito cenaculo qui interdum fio Juppiter, quando lubet. (861-63) With these distinctly paternalistic words and attitude, Jupiter comes back both for the benefit of the audience and Alcumena. Nunc hue honoris uestri uenio gratia, Ne hanc incohatam trans igam comoediam. Simul Alcumenae, quam uir insontem probri Amphitruo accusat, ueni ut auxilium feram . (867-870) (27) lb., 831.

(32) We agree with Buchner, op. cit , p. 153 that this second monologue has no dramatic function whatsoever, but, in our opinion, Plautus introduces it to stress the benevolence of the divinity.</page><page sequence="7">880 A. C. ROMANO And since he feels responsible for the troubles he has created (ss), he pledges, corroborating Mercurius' announcement in the prologue, help and enlightenment Post igitur demum faciam res fiat palam, Atque Alcumenae in tempore auxilium feram. (876-877) Before the denouement, Jupiter indulges in further games such as the scene of the reconsiliation between Alcumena and the pseudo- Amphitruo. "Wir haben es hier vielmehr mit einem ganz anderen Jupiter zu tun, nicht dem gewaltingen, der die Sternenlaufe an halt, vom Ubermass des Verlangens gepackt, son- dern einem komischen Liebhaber, der sein Miitchen an dem, den er betriigt, kiihlt und jede Gelegenheit wahrnimmt" (34). At the end of the play, Bromia describes the prodigies to Amphitruo. The possibility of divine intervention dawns in Amphitruo's mind (35). Finally the unequivocal disclosure of the nature of the intruder, calculatedly delayed (36), restores Jupiter's majesty (37). Summus imperator diuum atque hominum Juppiter. ( 1 1 22) Amphitruo's rejoicing (38) and the theophany finish the play. The character of Jupiter fluctuates with pendular movement between casualness and solemnity, between human weakness and behaviour and divine concern and power. In fact, Biichner distinguishes between two Jupiters : " Der mythische Jupiter, der von Liebe erfafit sich einmal Alcumena naht und dieses Beisammensein durch das Anhalten des Sternenlaufes verlangert, vertragt sich nicht mit einem Jupiter, der mit Alcumena ein siebenmonatiges Verhaltnis clam uirum hat. Der Widerspruch verstarkt sich, wenn wir den zweiten Teil der Komodie hinzunehmen. Es lasst sich leicht erkennen, da B der Jupiter, der Alcumena versohnt, damit sie ihn beim zweiten Besuch und iiberhaupt in Zukunft nicht abweise, eben dieser Normal liebhaber (33) Nam mea sit culpa, quod egoment contraxerim, si id Alcumenae innocenti expetat.

Yet, at every moment all the strings of the situation are in Jupiter's hands. He provokes misunderstandings and then re-establishes harmony. A fair and benign divinity, he cannot tolerate innocent mortals to be wronged because of his deeds and in the final scene, he makes sure that all doubt is dispelled. Jupiter returns to his realm unmodified by his experiences while the mortals reassume happily their everyday life (40). Os Amphitrides (4I) by Luis de Camdes is a landmark in the development of the Amphitryon theme, for it is the first play which introduces the mistaken recognition. When Jupiter and Amphitriao confront each other, Sosias recognizes Jupiter as the true Amphitriao. As a consequence, Jupiter re-enters the house to see Alcmena, and Amphitriao is shut out. In this play Jupiter is moved by love ex- clusively. The prophecy of the birth of Hercules is a last moment face-saving, honour- restoring resource. Jupiter does not appear at the end : only his voice is heard On the whole, the divine power and presence has been toned down throughout the play. In 1668 Moliere wrote his Amphitryon. Moliere's most significant innovation is to shift the time of the action from immediately before the birth of Hercules to a night shortly after the wedding of Amphitryon and Alcmene. In this way Moliere restores unity to what, from the time of Plautus, has been a double plot(42). Moliere resolutely does away with everything connected with the birth of Hercules in order to concentrate on the errors of the long night. We learn, it is true, from Jupiter's final explanation that Alcmene will give birth to Hercules, but the event, relegated to the mediate future, is minimized. The prologue (4S) faces us with Mercure asking for the co-operation of the Nuit who is a bit remiss. Full of irony she says : "Voila sans doute un bel emploi que le grand Jupiter m'apprete et Ton donne un nom fort honnete au service qu'il veut de moi". (120-123) (39) Op. cil , p. 187. The distinction carries into the style: "Es sind nun die Szenen, in denen der Liebhaber Jupiter erscheint, im Stil verschieden von denen, in dem wir es mit dem kosmischen Jupiter des Kalkiils zu tun haben". ibid. (40) "Insofern hat die Komodie schon etwas Optimistisches. Aber es ist nicht der Optimismus, der an den Weltlauf oder die Weisheit des Bewaltigens der Situation durch Resignation und Verzicht glaubt. Die Komodie scheint mir eine Zwischenstellung zwischen der Kritik der euripideischen Tragodie und dem Optimismus der Neuen Komodie einzunehmen". Ib., p. 205. (41) Written between 1544 and 1549.

"Laissons dire tous les censeurs". (103) Mercure portrays Jupiter as a part-time Don Juan, who occasionally takes leave of his dignity and engages himself in some adventure as a kind of relaxation. "Je le tiendrais fort miserable s'il ne quittait jamais sa mine redoutable". (81-32) But if Jupiter is characterized by some human frailty like his penchant for mortal beauties (44), Mercure is afflicted by banal human complaints like tiredness. 44 Ma foi, me trouvant las pour ne pouvoir fournir aux difterents emplois ou Jupiter m'engage ..." (7-8) The Nuit, quite aware of the biensiance asks : "Sied-il bien a des dieux de dire qu'ils sont las? ... Mais il faut sans cesse garder le decorum de la divinite". (12-14) Mercure agrees with the idea of divine decorum but he can't help blaming the poets ; he has to fulfill his duties on foot, and is bitter about his plebeian destiny. "... et de me laisser a pied, moi comme un messager de village". (31-32) His winged feet are not much help. "Oui, mais pour aller plus vite est-ce qu'on s'en lasse moins?" (45-46) How human can a god become (45)! And Mercure's humanization inevitably reaches Jupiter, his father and colleague. In the Jupiter- Alcmene relationship, Moliere has introduced the husband -lover duality very much to the taste of a refined and tolerant society such as the French court of the xvnth century (46). Jupiter wants to be loved as the lover. "Vous voyez un mari ; vous voyez un amant : Mais l'amant seul me touche, a parler franchement; Et je sens pres de vous, que le mari me gene". (590-592) (44) Mom£re. Amphitryon , 55-56. "Et vous n'ignorez pas que ce m ait re des Dieux aime a s'humaniser pour des beautes mortelles". (45) In Plautus Mercury complains about incarnating a slave. In Moliere he groans against his role and attributes as god. (46) C. N. D. Costa, op. cil , p. 95.</page><page sequence="10">THE AMPHITRYON THEME AGAIN 883 Further on he says : "Que le mari ne soit que pour votre vertu et que de votre oaeur, de bonte revetu ram ant ait l'amour et toute la tendresse". (606-607) Alcmene rejects such a fine distinction. 44 Je ne separe point ce qu'unissent les dieux ; et l'epoux et 1'amant, me sont fort precieux". (620-621) Jupiter is portrayed as "an enamoured and gallant grand- seigneur" (47) involved in a most ironical situation, where, in order to gain Alcmene, the lover pretends to be the husband but at the same time he wants to be received as the lover (48). Jupiter took on Amphitryon's shape since it was the only possible access to Alcmene, but he wants to be recognized on his own merits. It looks as if the almighty god has some doubts about his own charm and amorous abilities and he wants Alcmene to acknowledge his superiority in respect to Amphitryon. Actually he is competing with the absent husband, a rival he judges to be of his own caliber, and he presses Alcmene with insistant questions and requests in search of the reassuring answer. But the unbeatable common sense of Alcmene rejects this sentimental casuistry. When Jupiter comes for the second time to Alcmene, this lover-husband dichotomy provides him with a not altogether fair device whereby he puts all the blame on the husband. "L'epoux, Alcmene, a commis tout le mal. 1'amant n'a point de part a ce transport brutal". (1304-5) A few lines later: "Haissez, detestez l'epoux ; J'y consens et vous 1'abandonne". (1319-1320) But by the third act he feels it is his responsibility to clarify the confusion he has provoked. 44 Alcmene attend de moi de public temoignage. Sa vertu, que 1'eclat de ce desordre outrage, veut qu'on la justifie, et j'en vais prendre le soin". (1691-1693) To the puzzled Amphitryon Mercure says : 440ui, vous 1'allez voir tous et sachez par avance, que c'est le grand maitre des dieux, que sous les traits cheris de cette ressemblance, Alcmene a fait, du ciel, descendre dans ces lieux". (1870-1873) (47) Oijan Lindberger, op. cit , p. 70. (48) C. N. D. Costa, op. cit., p. 97.</page><page sequence="11">884 A. C. ROMANO When Jupiter attempts to soothe Amphitryon's fury, he tells him that he should rejoice being the rival of a God. "Un partage avec Jupiter, n'a rien du tout qui deshonore : et, sans doute il ne peut etre que glorieux, de se voir le rival du souverain des dieux". (1898-1901) Actually it is Jupiter who is Amphitryon's rival, and a defeated one as he himself honestly admits. "Et c'est moi, dans cette aventure qui, tout dieu que je suis, doit etre le jaloux". (1903-1904) In Plautus the whole play is geared towards the final prodigy and epiphany. In Moliere the play ends in a prudent and eloquent silence. Only Sosie, the inveterate talker, cannot help commenting on the silence. "Sur telles affaires toujours le meilleur est de ne rien dire". (1942-1943) The august omnipotent Plautine Jupiter, appears here deprived of his dignity. He is reduced to the level of a light-hearted libertine (49). Actually he behaves as a shrewd and unscrupulous intruder. He regains the audience's favour however, when he rescues Alcmene from calumny at the price of admitting defeat. It should be born in mind that humiliation is a highly unsuitable position for a god - a crimen diuinae maiestatis - even if it is self-inflicted. Dryden's Amphitryon (40) does not modify the Moliere version. He proliferates details, includes an extra underplot, but the basic situation remains the same. Only the wrong recognition is added. Amphitryon and Jupiter are both on stage and Alc- mena, seeing just Amphitryon, goes to him as to her proper choice. Repulsed by him, she is welcomed by Jupiter and this makes her decide that he is really her husband. "The face may have deceived me in the choice Thy kindness is a guide that cannot err". (V, I) With Kleist's Amphitryon, which appeared in 1807, we enter quite a different at- mosphere. The play is called a comedy but tragic features abound. Alcmena, and to a lesser degree Amphitryon, are victims of a cunning and cruel Jupiter. The god exerts overwhelming pressure to force Alkmene to distinguish between the husband and the lover.

Sie schmerzt mich diese schmahliche Verwechslung (4,V' (467-70) For Jupiter, the intruder is Amphitryon. "Und der Gedanke ist mir unertraglich dass du den Laffen bloss empfangen hast, der kalt ein recht auf dich zu haben wahnt". (472-473) This Jupiter is an unfair fighter, and he discredits his rival. Amphitryon is not only der Laffen but also der eitle Feldherr der Thebaner ("). This possessive lover who demands all Alkmene's love is also a possessive god who has come to claim his due. He accuses Alkmene of adoring her husband when she is worshipping Jupiter. 44 Ist nicht Amphitryon, der Geliebte stets, vor welchem du im Staube liegst?" (1452-1453) "Und meinst du nicht, dass solche Abgotterei ihn krankt? Wird er wohl gern dein schones Herz entbehren? Nicht auch gern von dir sich innig angebetet fuhlen?" (1458-1461) Far from the Jupiter concerned exclusively with satisfying his own caprice, we find here a divinity dependent on human behaviour, dependent on human love. Far also from the Jupiter, who in his second visit uses an innocent stratagem to recover Alk- mena's confidence, this Jupiter, while impersonating Amphitryon, pleads his own cause. He appeals to compassion, "teilnehmende Liebe fur seine erhabene Ein- samkeif ("). "Auch der Olymp is ode ohne Liebe. Was gibt der Erdenvolker Anbetung gestiirzt in Staub, der Brust, der lechzenden?" (1519-1521) A skilful dialectitian, he obtains the answer he wants with a pretended hypothetical question. "Doch wenn ich, frag ich, dieser Gott dir ware dir liebend vom Olymp herabgestiegen wie wiirdest du dich dann zu fassen wissen?" (1546-1548) Alkmene "So wiird ich folgen dir, wohin du gehst, und wars auch, wie Euridike, zum Orkus".

"Wenn du empfindlich fur den Ruhm nicht bist, zu den Unsterblichen die Staffel zu ersteigen, bin ichs: ..." (1349-51) "Wohlan, ich sags, ich neide Tyndarus, und wiinsche Sohne mir, wie Tyndariden". (1354-55) Finally, the confrontation of the two Amphitryons on stage, which in Moliere is a playful scene fecund in quid pro quo's, in Kleist is a battle. Jupiter pushes an already doubtful Alkmene into the wrong choice and prolongs his game pitilessly. "Jupiter. Wohlan! Du bist Amphitryon. Amphitryon. Ich bins ! und wer bist du, furchtbarer Geist? Jupiter. Amphitryon. Ich glaubte, dass dus wiisstest". (2291-2293) When Jupiter eventually discloses his identity (54), he grants Amphitryon the son for whom he has asked, but Alkmene, after her wrong recognition, has lost con- fidence in her own judgment and will never recover her peace of mind. The Plautine model of Jupiter is completely lost to view. In the Roman comedy the magnanimous divinity plays an inoffensive trick on the mortals and begets a benefactor for humanity. He asked nothing from Alcmena, certainly not her love which should be devoted to her husband. He just usufructed for a night - even if a long one - what belonged to Amphitruo ("). In Kleist Jupiter is a self-centered god, oblivious of the suffering he inflicts. Totally irresponsible (46), he has no qualms about torturing a hypersensitive Alkmene or competing unfairly with Am- phitryon. The benevolent god has been transformed into an egoist and jealous being, much too close to a mortal. In 1929 Giraudoux wrote Amphitryon 38. This brilliant and original treatment of the theme offers us a different Jupiter, a naive and predictable one. Mercure in- forms us : "II est vraiment l'heure de reveiller mon maftre, car il deteste etre presse dans son depart, et surement il tiendra comme avec toutes ses amies, dans les propos de saut de lit, a reveler a Alcmene qu'il est Jupiter, pour jouir de sa surprise et de sa fierte". (p. 65-66) (57) (54) Kleist, op. cit ., p. 2310. (55) In Plautus' play, Jupiter talks of usuraria uxor (498 and 980), cf. also usura corporis 108 and 1135. (56) Hans Badewitz, op. cit , p. 82.

At the beginning when Jupiter wants to enter Alcmene's house, he announces himself as the lover. Alcmene will let him in only when he declares himself to be the husband. So the husband- lover duality is eliminated very early in the play. Once the first night is over, Jupiter, according to his habit, struggles to indicate his divine nature to Alcmene but time and time again he encounters the candour of an Alcmene incapable of lying and impervious to any idea of double identity. Jupiter's hints pass unnoticed and his lecture about the universe is wasted on Alcmene. Jupiter tries another way. He expects Alcmene to appreciate the night that they spent together and wants her to describe it. "Jupiter Quelle nuit divine! Alcmene Tu es faible, ce matin, dans tes epithetes, cheri. Jupiter Je dis divine ! " (p. 68) 44 Alcmene ... si je voulais donner un adjectif a cette nuit, mon cheri, je dirais qu'elle fut conjugate. II y avait en elle une securite qui m'egayait ... II me manquait cette apprehension divine, que je ressens pourtant toutes les fois, de te voir a chaque minute mourir dans mes bras". (p. 78) Jupiter has to face the mortal blow of "conjugate". Costa describes "Alcmene as typifying the contentment of a wife in her happy bourgeois marriage" (58). Actually "conjugate" and "securite" are the bourgeois elements and they are applied to her relationship with Jupiter. For her husband, she reserves the "apprehension divine" which invalidates Costa's point. Not only do Jupiter's amorous abilities suffer a shock, but also his pride in his immortality, another resource by which he expects to impress Alcmene. When he promises her immortality, she answers: "Immortelle? A quoi bon? A quoi cela sert-il? - Jupiter. Comment, a quoi! Mais a ne pas mourir! - Alcmene. Et que ferai-je, si je ne meurs pas?" (p. 77) "Je ne crains pas la mort. C'est Fenjeu de la vie. ... Devenir immortel, c'est trahir pour un humain". (p. 78-79) The simplicity and the exquisite sensitiveness of Alcmene disarms Jupiter. What she expresses is not naive contentment with her life. It is a full awareness of human destiny, a deep insight into life. She knows that death is what ultimately makes life meaningful. She reaches here a heroic stature if we agree that the hero is not necessarily the victor, the strong one, but the common human being who accepts life as it is and faces death without delusion or despair. Jupiter, step by step is forced out of his position. Finally he admits defeat to Mercure. (58) Op. cit p. 116.</page><page sequence="15">888 A. C. ROMANO "C'est Alcmene qui avait remporte sur moi la victoire. Du coucher au re veil, je n'ai pu etre avec elle un autre que son mari". (p. 85) "Elle n'a pas d' imagination, et peut-etre pas beauooup plus d'intelligence. Mais il y a justement en elle quelque chose d'inattaquable et de borne &lt;)ui doit etre Tinfini humain". (p. 87) "Cent fois elle a change par une phrase humble ou charmante, la verite divine en verite humaine". (p. 89) The fact that it is Jupiter who spent the first night in Amphitryon's house is unknown to everybody, Alcmene included. When according to Mercure's an- nouncement Jupiter comes for the second time, Alcmene tries to dissuade him from his intentions and offers him friendship instead. This unpretentious Jupiter learns about friendship, a purely human phenomenon, and must admit that in heaven the gods are not very well informed. "Alcmene ... Je voudrais creer entre nous un lien plus doux encore et plus puissant ... Je vous 1'ofifre Jupiter Et c'est? Alcmene L'amitie. (p. 170) Jupiter Amitie ... II est vrai que si haut, certaines pratiques des hommes nous echappent encore ... (p. 171) Jupiter Et que ferons-nous, si je deviens ton ami? Alcmene D'abord je penserai a vous au lieu de croire a vous ..."(p. 173-174) Jupiter has learned to respect the love which Alcmene and Amphitryon share, therefore he tells Alcmene a pious lie when asked whether he has actually spent a night with her. Quite marginally does he announce the birth of a child to be called Hercules because they like the name. In Giraudoux Jupiter is not credited as an exceptional lover, his immortality loses all prestige and he has to be initiated in the meaning of friendship. The almight god, having learned his lesson, returns to heaven wiser and humbler. The distinguished Brazilian playwright, Guilherme Figueiredo, born in 1915, famous for his play A raposa e as uvas (translated into numerous languages and performed even in China), wrote in 1 949 A god slept here , which won many theatre prizes in Brazil. In 1952 the play was produced in Paris and also had resounding success on Broadway (59). Figueiredo deals with the well-known Amphitryon myth but he introduces an essential difference : it is not Jupiter who pretends to be Amphitryon but, instead, Amphitryon comes to his own house pretending to be Jupiter.

"Alcmena Alem disso, la esta de novo a provocar os deuses. (p. Ill) Voz £ melhor resign ares ao teu posto, que os deuses nao te ajudarao. Anfitriao Os deuses nao tern tempo de ajudar os mortais : estao muito ocupados a provar que existem". (p. 112)(61) But the general is quite disturbed by an oracle which predicts that a man will sleep in his house while he is out in the camp. Added to this, a remark of King Creon : "Tua mulher merece una noite con Jupiter" (p. 114) (62) makes him suspicious that the king has put him at the head of the army just to keep him away. Moved by jealousy Anfitriao and Sosia decide to go back home pretending to be Jupiter and Mercury respectively. Anfitriao, playing Jupiter sub specie Amphitruonis , is warmly welcomed by Alcmena (who is well aware of the attempted deception) and goes through the torture of thinking that his wife will be unfaithful to him in order to please the pseudo- Jupiter. The "god" has sudden scruples about Alcmena's virtue. 44 Alcmena Afinal, Senhor, isto diz respeito a meu marido, e nao aos deuses. Se eu engano a meu marido, ele e que deve ficar furioso. Anfitriao Saiba ... Saiba ... que eu zelo pela honra do seu marido ... E a minha fun^ao. Os deuses foram feitos para proteger os lares! "(p. 153) (63) This situation creates ample possibilities for a quick and witty dialogue in which Alcmena pretends to believe to be in the presence of a real Jupiter and Anfitriao is entangled in his own trap. He tries to reveal his true identity but Alcmena refuses - or pretends to refuse - to accept his confession (M). In order to punish her husband properly, Alcmena asks that Jupiter for a child. Anfitriao rejects the demand and returns to camp in utter misery. (60) The page numbers correspond to Guilherme Figueiredo, Um deus dormiu la' em casa , Rio de Janeiro, 1970. For the English version I am following the translation of Lloyd George, A god slept here , Rio de Janeiro, 1937. Since there are some differences between the Portuguese and the English ver- sion. I am modifying partially L. F. George's translation in order to be closer to the original. (61) "Alcmena You are provoking the Gods. Voice It is better to resign your post because the gods are not going to help you. Amphitryon The gods do not have time to help the mortals. They are too busy trying to prove to each other that they exist". (62) "Your wife deserves a night with Jupiter". (63) "Alcmena Finally, Sir, this respect to my hust&gt;and is not god's business. If I am unfaithful to my husband, he is the one to be furious. Amphitryon But I care about the honour of your husband. It is my job. Gods have been made to protect the lares". (64) Parallel to this the underplot of Sosia and Tessala, Alcemena's confidente, develops, but common sense prevails because, being slaves, they do not believe in gods. "Os deuses sao um luxo de gente livre". "The gods are luxury of freebom people" (p. 159).</page><page sequence="17">890 A. C. ROMANO The general comes back victorious but people have seen lights in Alcmena's house during the previous night and want to lapidate her for adultery. Anfltriao is again trapped. He must admit either to dishonour or to negligence of his duties for abandoning the army the night before the battle. He resorts to the prophecy and the blasphemous Anfltriao announces publicly that Jupiter himself visited his wife the night before. In this version of the theme of Amphitryon there is no divine presence. All the characters are human and the false pretences of Anfltriao and Sosia deceive no one. The myth of Jupiter's visit, exploited ad usum populi , is the deus ex machina which saves honour and respectability. It is impossible not to notice from these plays that there is a constant trend towards the humanization of Jupiter and Mercury, and the consequent secularization of the myth of Amphitryon. The Plautine omnipotent god becomes a civilized causeur in Moliere, a cruel and envious rival in Kleist, a rather unheroic figure in Giraudoux and non-existent in Figueiredo. All that is left is the name of the god for the benefit of gullible superstitious people. On the other hand the character of Alcmena becomes a progressively more com- plex one. The monolithic righteousness of the Roman matron is replaced by a more understanding person in Moliere. Kleist presents a conflicting personality, tortured by doubts. Giraudoux portrays a sensitive creature in immediate contact with reality whose insights into life make her champion of the human condition without even trying. Figueiredo creates a sagacious Alcmena who sees through her husband's schemes and plays along to punish him. From a passive role she becomes more and more instrumental in the development of the plot (65). Perhaps it will be only a venial oversimplification to state that there is an inverse relationship between the psychological complexity of Alcmena and the presence of the divine power in the plays.
