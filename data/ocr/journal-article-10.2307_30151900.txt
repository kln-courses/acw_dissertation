<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY IN SMALL FLOCKS OF WHITE LEGHORNS' A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS,2 AND W. C. ALLEE Whitman Laboratory of Experimental Zo6logy, University of Chicago OU R original interest in this study stems from the reports on social organization in the flocks of common domestic fowl by Schjelderup- Ebbe (1922, 1935). The avian hierarchy in flocks of hens and of other birds has received much analytical attention by Allee and his associates (see Literature Cited). These studies have been con- cerned with endocrine, physiological, and psychological aspects of group behavior and have recently been summarized by Allee (1942, 1943, 1945) and by Collias (I944). It early became apparent that certain differences were associated with position in the so-called "peck-order" of the flock. High-ranking hens possess a greater freedom of activity as compared with those of low social status; for ex- ample, they have precedence to food (Masure and Allee, 1934). Many aspects of observed relations to social status are summed up in the statement that fewer eggs are laid by hens in the lower half of the social order than by those composing the more aggressive half (Sanctuary, 1932). We have here attempted to deter- mine a part of the relation of the social order to the mating behavior in such flocks. In many ways the present study is a continuation and extension of the work of Skard (i937). A preliminary ab- stract of some of the results has been published by one of us (Guhl, 194i). ANIMALS AND THEIR TREATMENT All animals used in these studies were White Leghorns; we have reason to be- lieve that all were pure-bred representa- tives of that breed. Observations by the first author on two flocks of cocks and hens provided the main body of data to be analyzed here; data have also been considered that were obtained during previous observations on some of these birds, as well as on others. These flocks were housed in the poultry-house at Whitman Laboratory in pens 14.5 feet long, 4.5-5.0 feet wide, and 8 feet high. They were continuously illuminated (be- tween 6:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.) by a 60- watt ceiling lamp near the center of each pen in addition to the natural light en- tering from south windows. During the cold months the pens were heated by steam radiators and were roughly con- trolled at a temperature of 1oo-150 C. A more complete description of the general situation may be found elsewhere (Allee, Collias, and Lutherman, 1939). Mash and water were available at all times, and a mixture of grain was fed during the afternoons. Feeding and general care, in- cluding cleaning of the pens, were in the hands of the observer, to whom the birds became accustomed and whom they ap- peared to ignore during observations as he watched them from the outside of the pen. Flock D.-This flock contained 7 hens, I We are indebted to Professor L. F. Payne and Dr. D. C.

ALLEE which were mature when obtained in October, 1938. The 4 cocks were received as newly hatched chicks in August, i939. They were reared with females of their own age and were separated from them about 3 weeks after treading (copulation) had become frequent. These males were then kept in a pen by themselves from early January, 1940, to April and had not been exposed to this flock of hens before the present experiments. Straight-line peck-orders prevailed among both hens and cocks; a change in order occurred among the cocks during the course of the observations and will be noted later. Beginning April 13, 1940, the males were placed singly and successively into the pen of the hens of flock D on alter- nate days. This procedure, which left the hens without males every other day, was taken as a precaution against a probable carry-over of certain reactions of the hens toward a given cock that might influence their behavior toward his successor. The sequence in which the males were intro- duced remained the same. Each cock was placed in the pen during the preceding night or early morning of its scheduled day of exposure to the hens. The record- ed observations of 2 hours' duration (I hour on the initial day) were made be- tween 3:00 and 6:00oo P.M. until each male was exposed ten times and for a total of 19 hours of observation. On June 22, all 4 cocks were intro- duced together into the pen, where they remained with the hens. No records were made until July 4, to allow for adjust- ment. The initially intense interaction caused the hens to remain on the roost. Cock IV died on July 24; and on Sep- tember 8 the dominant cock, I, was re- moved for a period of 30 days, for reasons to be discussed later; cocks II and III were left with the hens throughout this period of observation. Flock F.-These 9 hens and 4 cocks were received in February, 1941, when nearly i year old. All of the birds but cock VIII came from the same flock. Pecking triangles occurred among the hens for io days; hen GB developed a paralysis and was removed on May 27; and on the same day YG gained domi- nance over PB and so initiated the only triangle that persisted through most of the experiment with this flock. The males of this group, especially VI, were not socially aggressive and did rela- tively little pecking. Threats and avoid- ing reactions were used to determine their peck-order; back-pecks and brief fights, more threatening than final, were common throughout much of the experi- ment. However, the order given in Tables 174 was definite for the period covering the time during which treading data were taken. When all the males were placed in the pen of these hens, pecking by the males occurred more frequently and the same order prevailed. Cock I of flock D was included in part of the observations of flock F for general comparative pur- poses. Each day for a total of 6o days, begin- ning April 26, 1941 (exclusive of a 5-day interval at the end of the fourth round for the males), one cock in a wire cage was placed within the pen of the hens. He was released during the observation period of 30 minutes and was then re- placed by another caged cock in prepara- tion for the observations of the following day. This method greatly increased the number of matings and the amount of other intersexual behavior that was ex- hibited during the observation period (cf. Skard, 1937). All 4 cocks of flock F were introduced into the pen for perma- nent residence on July 3 and observed for 60 minutes daily for 48 days. Flock G.-This group of 6 hens was</page><page sequence="3">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 367 used as an accessory flock in certain tests of the males of flock D. It was composed of hens from several sources, of various ages, and also included a poulard. Preliminary observations were made using the following additional flocks: Flock A 6.-The 6 birds composing this flock had lived together for over 4 months when observations started early in February, 1939. The flock included 4 moderately inbred young White Leghorn hens, received as pullets from Iowa State College, and 2 old hens from flock D. Flock E.-Flock E was a small lot of hens from an Indiana Farm Bureau strain that had been intraflock bred for 6 years. These yearling hens were culled from a large flock and were received by us late in April, 1939; observations on mating frequency were begun after the hens had been under our care for a few weeks. Two cocks, other than those men- tioned for flocks D and F, were used in certain earlier tests. These were obtained from a local poultry farm when about 7 months old. One of these was used with flocks A6 and E; the other was with the flock-D hens in 1939 when the data for these three flocks (Table 9) were ob- tained. Both these males were very ac- tive sexually. To recapitulate: The cocks and hens were kept in unisexual flocks to deter- mine their respective peck-orders. The males were then placed singly with the hens of their respective flocks every other day in flock D and daily in flock F to study the sexual behavior of the hens in association with each individual cock. The order of introduction of the cocks into the pen of the hens on successive days remained unchanged. After several weeks of such observations the cocks of each flock were placed simultaneously into the pen of their respective female flockmates, where they remained for an- other series of observations on sexual be- havior under these more complicated conditions. At certain times the same birds were used to study social discrimi- nation, the results of which have been re- ported separately (Guhl, 1942). These flocks were under observation during the latter part of the afternoon, when mat- ings occur most frequently (Heuser, 1916; Philips, 1919; Upp, 1928; Skard, 1937; Parker, McKenzie, and Kempster, 1940). The peck-orders given in Tables i and 2 were based on more than 9,000 pecks or threats; nearly i,ooo matings were observed during this particular series of observations and experiments. OBSERVATIONS Tables i and 2 present many of the basic data obtained in flock D and flock F in 1940-41. Table i summarizes the data obtained when the cocks were in- troduced singly and successively into the pens of their respective flocks of hens. Table 2 gives a similar summary for the observations when all 4 cocks of each flock were continuously in the pens of the hens. The results for each flock are sepa- rated in the body of the tables. The hens are designated by letters and are listed according to their position in the peck- order, beginning with the alpha hen. The cocks are indicated by Roman numerals, and their peck-order reads from left to right. It will be noted that the male order shown in Table 2 differs from that in Table i, since in the meantime cock IV had defeated cock III. The column headings marked "Tread- ings," "Courtings," "Sex Invitations," and "Avoidances" (described below) in- dicate the types of behavior tabulated; no avoidances were recorded in Table I for flock D, as the value of such data was not appreciated when this study began.</page><page sequence="4">368 A.

These rates and ranks are given in Tables 3 and 4, in terms of (a) the frequency of each type of behavior as the mean number per hour and (b) the relative rank for each bird among the members of its flock and sex in its participation in these types of behavior. Equal ranking is indicated by half-steps. The same method of ranking was used with flock F, although the num- ber of minutes each bird spent on the floor was the same for all individuals, since the roost and nest boxes were screened off during observation time. Mean rates are also given for each hen and each cock and for the sexes as groups. The latter rates were computed from to- tal observations (Tables I and 2) and aggregate time rather than as the means of the rates given in the body of these tables. OBSERVATIONS ON GENERAL MATING BEHAVIOR WITHIN FLOCKS The initial sexual reactions of the cocks toward a hen were recorded as courtings and involved such behavior as raising the hackle while pointing the head toward a female; catching a hen by the comb or neck; placing a foot on the saddle of a prospective mate; or pursuing her on the run. The wing-flutter or so- called "waltz," also often included as a form of courting, was recorded separate- ly in the protocol, since this behavior seems to be characteristically somewhat different from other courtship patterns. In the waltz the cock lowers and flutters the wing on the opposite side from the female and makes an arc about the hen with a series of short, quick steps. Often the hens seem to be sexually in- different to the presence of the cock, but they may squat or crouch before him; such behavior by the hen was recorded as a "sex invitation." A hen may respond to active courtship by squatting, in which case copulation usually follows; she may be indifferent; or she may avoid the male. Her avoidance may take vari- ous forms with varying intensities, from merely stepping aside to running; or if the male mounts her, she may struggle to get away; or she may go to the roost and remain there, thus giving a sustained avoidance. The movement of a hen was not con- sidered as avoidance unless some overt behavior by the cock toward her could be associated with her reaction. Most of the recorded avoidances were responses to courting or to attempts to tread. No records of avoidance were taken when the flock-D males were introduced singly into the pen of the D-hens. Avoiding re- actions may be accompanied by vocali- zations ranging from a faint cry to a loud squawk. The types of sexual behavior we have observed are similar to those out- lined by Skard (1937). It is well known that to copulate the male mounts the squatting hen, grasps her comb or hackle with his beak, and balances himself on her back with a treading motion. The hen crouches low and moves her tail to one side, while the cock rears up and, spreading his tail, the vents meet. An attempt was made to de- termine and record whether the copula- tions were initiated by the male or by the female, or simultaneously by both. In some instances the cock mounted a struggling hen and such matings ap- peared to. be forced. As compared with the obviously male-initiated and female- initiated ("invited") matings, there is a third category, composed of incidences in which mounting by the cock and crouch- ing by the hen occurred simultaneously. In the latter the initiator could not be determined, since the crouch may have</page><page sequence="7">HETEROSEXUAL BEHAVIOR PAT] TREADINGS COURTINGS SEX AVOIDANCES TREADINGS COURTINGS SE AVOIDANCES TREAD] INVITATIONS" INVITATIONS PECK- ORDER Fr.

Matings were recorded as incomplete whenever it was obvious that the vents failed to meet. Although not systematically studied, it was observed in the earlier tests with flock D and other flocks that thirst, food, and roosting drives, especially thirst, seemed readily to take precedence over the sex drive. A cock not watered on a given day was likely to spend much of the observation period drinking, in place of paying attention to the hens. If the observation periods were late in the afternoon, the cock was likely to go to roost with the hens instead of attempting to mate with them. An effort was made to avoid these complicating factors. COMPARISONS AMONG THE HENS The analysis in the present section is limited to the relatively simple situation that obtained when the cocks were in- troduced singly and successively. There was some daily variation in mating fre- quency by the individual hens. Heuser (1916) made a similar observation. To test for the consistency of matings, the records from April 13 to June 20 of flock D and from April 26 to June 30 of flock F were selected. These data were not com- plicated by the effect of the presence of more than one cock or by the molting season and were all the more significant, since the time of the year includes the peak of the normal laying cycle. The number of treadings for odd-numbered and even-numbered days were tabulated for each hen, and paired comparisons for all the hens of each flock were then made by the method of "Student" and found to be statistically insignificant (P-val- ues &gt; 0o.57),3 which means that there was no real difference between the num- ber of matings by these hens for the al- ternate days during the season of the year sampled. The hens usually paid no attention when one of them was being trod, unless the one being mated cried or struggled vigorously to get free. On rare occasions a hen tried to peck an inferior flockmate while she was being held down by the cock. This was more likely to happen if there was an apparent antipathy be- tween them. Hen BR of flock D began to molt in July, and her rank in matings dropped from first place (Table 3, mean rate) to second place (Table 4, period A); she continued to mate less frequently as her molt became heavy, and consequently ranked sixth for period B. As a result of BR's decrease in sexual activity and YY's cessation of mating (see below), RY was mated more frequently and rose in mating rank from third place (Table 3) to top rank during period B. About 3 weeks after the close of period C, RY also entered a heavy molt, ceased to mate, and avoided all the males. The molt of the remaining D-hens was light and extended over a longer period of time. The observations of flock F did not extend through the molting season and offered no evidence of its effect on their sexual activity. The periodicities of the molt and of re- production appear to be independent (van der Meulen, 1939) but may affect each other secondarily, and their respec- tive cycles may show more or less over- lapping. The hens of the flocks that molt- ed heavily were very sensitive to han- dling, and we received the impression 3 P-values of 0.05 are taken as the upper limit of statistical significance, the smaller the fraction the higher the statistical probability.</page><page sequence="13">372 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE that this hypersensitive condition of the skin contributed much to the tendency of molting individuals to avoid close physical contact with the males. Hen YY of flock D was originally sec- ond in mating rank (Table 3, mean rates) and was first during period A (Table 4), when BR molted. On the first day of pe- riod B, YY received a pellet of testos- terone propionate, implanted subder- mally. Within 3 days she ceased to mate; and after the three treadings that oc- curred during this transitional period she became lowest in mating rank, re- maining so for the remainder of period B. Inspection of Tables 3 and 4 shows a suggestion of a negative correlation be- tween social ranks and ranking based on the frequency at which the hens were trod and at which they gave the so-called "mating invitation" to the cocks. These and other possible correlations will be considered further on page 380, after other pertinent observations have been presented. COMPARISONS AMONG THE COCKS Cocks introduced singly and successive- ly.-As with the hens, the cocks of both flocks showed a day-by-day consistency in their treading frequencies for the pe- riod during which this matter was tested with the hens. The P-values for the odd- numbered versus the even-numbered days of both groups were greater than 0.58. There was no evidence that molt- ing, which was light in all of the D-cocks, influenced their observed behavior. A comparison of the cocks is more complicated than that of the hens, as the positive and negative reactions of the hens toward the cocks as individuals may influence, to a greater or less degree, the frequency at which a rooster may have the opportunity to mate, court, re- ceive "sex invitations," or be avoided. The differential behavior of hens toward different cocks was more marked than was the comparable reaction of the cocks to the hens as individuals. Differences between the cocks may be considered in several ways: (a) by comparing the total number of matings and other behavior patterns for each cock under like condi- tions and during equal periods of obser- vations; (b) by the examination of the mean frequencies of the matings and courtings of each cock; (c) by studying the actions and reactions directed toward each cock by other cocks; (d) by a sta- tistical comparison of the frequencies of the female reactions toward each of the cocks; and (e) by descriptive remarks on the observed behavior of the cocks. The recorded treadings by the D-cocks when introduced singly and successively (Table i), with the possible exception of cock II, showed no very marked differ- ences between them in their success at mating with the hens as a group. Cock II courted the least number of times and was never "invited" to tread. Since some of the D-hens spent much time on the roost, out of contact with certain males, the individuality of the cocks becomes clearer when the rates of male activi- ties are considered as calculated from the time the given cock was closely as- sociated with hens on the floor of the pen. The frequency rates of the males and the mean rates of the females as a group, given in Table 3, suggest greater differ- ences between these cocks than those shown by the raw data. To test for the statistical significance of the differences between the cocks in the rates presented in Table 3, paired comparisons were made of the fre- quencies of the behavior patterns of the individual hens when in association with each cock. The mean mating frequency of all the hens when in association with</page><page sequence="14">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 373 cock II, of .21 matings per hour, is sig- nificantly greater than the mean rates of the other 3 cocks (P-values: 0.03-0.02). The mean rate (2.17) at which the hens were courted by II was decidedly greater than either of these frequencies with I or IV (P-values: 0.04 and o.oi). When con- sidered in the different possible pair- combinations, there is no statistical dif- ference between the rates for these types of behavior among the other cocks; dif- ferences in the rates at which each of the 4 cocks received "sex invitations" failed to show any statistical significance, in part because the 3 top-ranking hens gave no "sex invitations" during this period. The analysis points to cock II as the most active sexually. His comparative libido contrasts with the fact that he was the only male that all the hens failed to "in- vite" by crouching. Statistical tabulations often do not give a complete picture of behavior. This is particularly true if intensities of reac- tions are considered; hence descriptive remarks have value in the interpretation of the results. Cock II approached the hens quickly or chased them from one end of the pen to the other; this caused them to fly to the roost, where they tended to remain while he was in the pen. With the same total elapsed observation time the females spent a total of 2,32 minutes on the floor with cock II, as com- pared with 4,926 minutes with cock I. Of II's matings, 76 per cent were forced, and none of the hens "invited" him by squatting. Cock I approached the hens slowly from the rear and held his head over a female as though ready to grasp her comb, or he raised his hackle; if the hen moved away, he diverted his atten- tion to another; if a hen squatted, he trod. Only 15 per cent of I's matings ap- peared to be forced; 29 per cent were "invited"; and in the remaining 55 per cent courting and squatting appeared to be simultaneous. Cocks III and IV appeared to grade between I and II as to sex drive but closer to I than to II, with III probably more sexually active than IV; both forced 21 per cent of their copulations. In general, this comparison agrees with the preceding analysis. The negative reactions of the hens toward each of the cocks were not tabu- lated for flock D. But this factor was considered by an analysis of sustained avoidance made by paired comparisons of the total time these hens spent on the floor with each cock, the P-values of which are given in Table 5. These statistics support direct obser- vations and show that the hens gave significantly more sustained avoidance toward II than toward any other rooster, and the least toward cock I. These in- dividual differences also became signifi- cant when these same birds were tested in a discrimination cage (Guhl, 1942), where it was found that discriminations were notably influenced by individuality and that the birds acted and reacted ac- cording to former pair-contact experi- ence. These observations are in agree- ment with a conclusion drawn by Tin- bergen (1931) that "the members of a flock in which a peck-order occurs know each other individually revealing not only an amazing power of discrimination, but at the same time the working of rather intricate conditioning processes by which an animal forms separately special habits in relation to every individual." The raw data concerning the mating of the F-males (V, VI, VII, and VIII) given in Table i show no marked differ- ences between individuals in total num- bers of matings or "sex invitations" re- ceived. Cocks VI and VIII courted more and were avoided more than were V and</page><page sequence="15">374 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE VII. Some of these differences become more evident when activity rates are compared in a hen-by-hen analysis of the frequency of the female reactions (Table 3) toward each of the cocks. The following differences have statisti- cal probabilities (P-values) that lie be- tween 0.05 and 0.0004. Other possible comparisons are less valid statistically.

(It is well to remember that the peck- order of the F-cocks is indicated by the ordinal rank of the numerals and that cock I did not meet the F-cocks, and hence his relative social status is not known.) Cocks I, VI, and VIII courted more than did V or VII. The hens squat- ted less frequently for cock I than for V, VI, or VIII. They avoided I and VI more than VII, and they avoided VIII more than any of the other four males. Cock VIII had slightly more forced treadings and was less skilful than the others. Cock VII would stand idly, as though oblivious of his female penmates; and VI courted very mildly when a hen came near him. None of these cocks dis- played much intensity in sex behavior, and they seemed to be somewhat abnor- mal, with VIII more nearly approaching the normal pattern in sex behavior. A possible explanation of their apparent abnormality will be suggested later. As with cock II and the hens of flock D, the cocks that the F-hens avoided at the higher rates (I, VI, and VIII) were those that courted with a significantly higher frequency. Although the F-cocks were relatively weak in sexual initiative, the rates of courting and mating were higher than those found in flock D (Table 3). Each of the following modified factors prob- ably helped produce this result: (a) For most of the day preceding his period of free association with the hens each cock was placed in a wire cage in the pen near the hens, to augment sexual readiness. (b) The roosts and other possible retreats were blocked off, and the available floor space was approximately halved. (c) There was a ninefold increase in the rate of "sex invitations" by the F-hens as compared with those of the D-flock. Con- fronted by sexually unaggressive males, such reactions by the hens may be classed as compensatory behavior. Cock I of the D-flock was included in tests with F-hens in an attempt to secure a better basis for cross-comparisons of the mating behavior of the two sets of hens. The utility of cock I for compara- tive purposes is marred by complica- tions. In addition to the differences just outlined, this cock was now a year older; he was not penned with the F-cocks but had a pen to himself; he was now placed</page><page sequence="16">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 375 with young, rather than aged, hens; and these younger birds, between days with cock I, associated with the relatively un- aggressive F-cocks. Contrariwise, be- tween periods of association with cock I, the D-hens had experience with the no- tably aggressive cock II. Thus, several elements of both the physical and the social environment differed in the two sets of tests. We received the impression that cock I was relatively less acceptable to the F-hens than was to be expected from his comparative showing with the D-cocks. There was no discernible modification of the earlier sex technique shown by I in the later situation. He courted and trod the F-hens at a heightened rate, in- dicating that the generally increased fre- quencies of these behavior patterns among the F-hens resulted from altered conditions or modified traits of the hens. With both flocks D and F the observa- tions made when cocks are introduced singly and successively into the pens with hens indicate that the social position and the sexual drive of the cocks were not necessarily related and that the repro- ductive efficiency in the flock was only partially determined by the relative libido of the cocks. However, when 4 cocks were placed with a small group of hens, the interrelationship of their rela- tive social aggressiveness and their sexual drive became apparent. Four males in the pen of the hens.- When all 4 D-cocks were placed in the pen of the D-hens, the male interaction became intense, and for ii days the hens spent most of their time on the roost. The observations were divided into three periods (Tables 2 and 4). Period A, of 29 observations, may be considered as transitional; period B, of 34 observations, as a climax; and period C, of 31 observa- tions, as a test. Cock IV died accidentally on July 24, shortly before the end of period A. The previous male peck-order, with the cocks arranged in the straight line of I, II, III, and IV, changed on June 28, when IV defeated III. Cock II pecked III in the eye; and as a result of this temporary visual handicap, cock III lost a contest with IV and consequently his social position. He remained on the roost and lost 13 ounces in weight; by the very end of period A he ventured to the floor to feed, but then only when I and IV went to the roost. His hunger dominated his sex drive almost to the exclusion of the latter. Cocks II and III developed a toleration for each other on the roost, where they spent much time together. The sexually active II became condi- tioned to ignore the hens by a slower process. The alpha cock, I, charged at him when he approached a hen and drove him to the roost. This caused all the hens to scatter hurriedly and fly to any perch. Cock II soon learned to pass more time on the roost, and the hens learned to run whenever he came to the floor to feed. He lost 6 ounces in weight, and his hunger drive approximated that of III. Of II's 13 matings, 12 were incomplete (the vents did not meet), as a result of the resistance of the hens or the inter- ference of I and/or IV. The intense antagonism of I toward II contrasted with I's curious and extreme toleration of IV; the latter would inter- fere even when I was in the act of tread- ing a hen; IV did so 30 times, while I in- terfered with 20 of IV's matings. The hens learned to avoid IV, and it ap- peared as though they might nullify his sexual activity by means of their nega- tive discriminations; he succeeded in ob- taining 15 of his 33 copulations by push- ing I from treading position and mount- ing immediately. At first I would peck</page><page sequence="17">376 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE his usurper, but later he showed no agi- tation. This unusual toleration probably facilitated IV's successful revolt over II, which occurred the day before IV died. During period B both II and III spent more time on the floor, but they were conditioned to remain at a distance from the alpha cock and the hens. Cock II still courted at intervals, and his single copulation occurred early in this period. Cock III was psychologically castrated, i.e., completely suppressed sexually; and II nearly so. Cock II crowed at times, but III was not heard to crow after he lost his social position. The size of comb did not fluctuate to any marked degree in any of the males during the time when some were sexually suppressed. A simple test was made to determine whether the frustrated cocks II and III were capable of sexual behavior. Cocks I, II, and III were each placed singly on two different days with a strange flock for 3o-minute periods. Cock II trod 7 times and court- ed 27 times; III trod 5 times and courted 40 times, which compared favorably with I's 6 matings and 41 courtings under the same conditions. However, when II and III were then exposed singly for 30 min- utes with the D-hens, neither of them trod, and courtings were limited to 2 wing-flutters by III. This indicated that their sexual inhibition depended on their associates and was definitely related to the hens of the home pen. The dominant cock, I, was removed during period C to note whether the sexual activity of the inferiors would be- come re-established. Cock I was placed with flock G. Over an interval of 33 days cock II was seen to tread 3 times (2 were out of the formal observation time), and III mated ii times (7 out of the formal observation period). All of II's copula- tions were forced, but III trod only on invitation. Cock II pecked III when the latter trod, and there was some indica- tion that II might in time suppress III completely. Both cocks would at times give the food-call; but when a hen re- sponded, they would peck her. When these results are considered with those of the partial control situation summarized in Table i, the slight difference (in pe- riod C over B) in sexual behavior ap- peared to be negligible and suggests either that the conditioning effects as- sociated with psychological castration tend to persist or that the continuing conditioned avoidance displayed by the hens toward these roosters may have been a factor in the failure of cocks II and III to copulate at more nearly a normal rate. Another test was made to determine the nature, if any, of heterosexual condi- tioning involving the frustrated males. The alpha cock, I, was used as a control to evaluate, in a general way, the rela- tive sexual behavior of the hens. The cocks were exposed to flocks D and G singly on alternate days; each day one cock was placed with the D-hens and another with the G-hens for 20 minutes. This rotation continued until each roost- er had 8 exposures to each group of hens; between tests these males were housed together in a separate pen. The results are given in Table 6, from which it is evident that the inhibited sexual ac- tivity of cocks II and III when with the D-females affected their behavior when with the hens of flock G. Their courting increased notably, although they were not very successful in mating. The evi- dence supports the previous test, which showed that these two roosters were con- ditioned not to approach the D-hens. An analysis of sustained avoidance indicates that the D-hens were also conditioned to avoid these particular cocks. The observer gained the impression</page><page sequence="18">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 377 that the G-hens also learned to spend more time on the roost when cocks II and III were introduced-an impression that was confirmed in part by statistical analysis, since hens of flock G spent 37 per cent less time on the floor with II than with I (P-value, 0.03) and 25 per cent less time with III than with I (P- value, 0.07). The D-hens spent 34 per cent less time with II than with the alpha cock (P-value, 0.005) and 40 per cent less with III than with I (P-value, 0.006). Here, as in the discrimination tests (Guhl, 1942), the hens as a statisti- cal group showed differential behavior toward the cocks as individuals. We turn now to consider the F-males, which, as has been previously stated, were rather weak, so far as intensities of reactions were concerned, in both their social and sexual behavior. When all 4 were placed in the pen of the F-hens, there was an increase in pecking fre- quency among these cocks; but the sup- pressive influence of low status in their peck-order was less pronounced than TABLE 6 SUMMARY OF THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE D-COCKS WHEN TESTED SINGLY AND AL- TERNATELY WITH THE HENS OF FLOCKS D AND G WITH FLOCK D WITH FLOCK G PECK-ORDER Tread- Court- Tread- Court- ings ings ings ings I.......... 9 54 21 93 II......... o 19 3 I26 III........ . 0 2 3 95 Total.... 9 75 27 314 with cocks II and III in flock D. Cock VII approached the psychological cas- tration stage, as he trod only 7 times (Table 2), 4 of these times resulting in incomplete copulations. The differences between the frequencies of VII's mat- ings and courtings and those of the other three F-cocks were statistically signifi- cant (P-values ranged from 0.03 to o.oI). There were no significant differences be- TABLE 7 SUMMARY OF THE INTERFERENCES WITH MATING OR ATTEMPTS TO MATE AMONG THE F-COCKS The figures present the number of interferences by each of the cocks listed on the left with attempts to copulate by each of the other cocks.

Interferences with mating or attempts to mate are summarized in Table 7. Only the frustrated cock VII was completely inhibited from taking an aggressive role in competition for the possession of a receptive hen. These attacks were not limited to cocks of a particular status, although the alpha cock interfered in about 74 per cent of the observed in- stances. During the early part of this 48-day period these obstructions to copulation were caused by pecks de- livered on the treading male; by the fourth week the pecks became very light, or the interfering male would merely ap- proach the mating pair; and by the for- tieth day there was a tendency for the interloper to ignore the copulating male and to grasp the comb of the hen being trod. When an inferior rooster crowed or gave the food-call, he was usually challenged by the alpha V, with the re- sult that such vocalizations disappeared</page><page sequence="19">378 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE during most of these weeks. The male in- teraction lessened in intensity after the twenty-fifth day, and both these calls then reappeared to some extent. The hens showed a tendency toward sus- tained avoidance of the partially frus- trated males by moving to neutral cor- ners. This female reaction could not be qualified to the same extent as with the D-hens, since the roost was screened off and the floor space restricted during ob- servations to one-half that of the normal pen. With such closer contact one might have anticipated greater interaction be- tween the cocks and more evidence of psychological castration among normal young cocks. At the end of the observations corre- spondence with the breeder who fur- nished the birds revealed some interest- ing information on the early history of these cocks. Cocks V, VI, and VII were part of a group of 24 that had been penned with about 200 hens and were shipped to us as culls, which suggests that they were probably inferiors in this group of cocks. The indications are that they were conditioned when received, as 4 of the original 24 cocks had been killed by their superiors. Little was known about cock VIII; he came from a differ- ent source. If this assumption is correct, one might conclude, as with-the D-cocks, that conditioning of mating behavior patterns in roosters, once formed, tends to persist. The data for the cocks do not show any strong correlations between the social position per se of the individual males and the frequency of their mating be- havior when introduced singly and suc- cessively into a pen of hens (r = 0.4; P-value &gt; o.i). Cocks tended to be con- sistent in the frequency of matings when not inhibited by the presence of other males. However, as has just been stated, when 4 cocks were placed together in a pen containing a small number of hens, a form of suppression developed among the cocks; and the dominant male al- most completely castrated psychological- ly some of the low-ranking roosters. This shows that, as a result of their great- er freedom of the pen, the dominant cocks possessed precedence to mating in addition to precedence to food. There is some evidence that the activities leading to the frustration associated with sexual suppression, or the suppression itself, al- though it does not incapacitate a cock sexually, conditions the hens to avoid a suppressed cock or modifies his behavior in a manner which makes him less ac- ceptable to the hens. SEX DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR The males are more aggressive than the females and tend to avoid other males strongly or to fight back rather than to submit to them, whereas the hens with less aggressiveness than the males submit more readily to cocks and to ag- gressive hens by lowering the head or by squatting. Like the cocks, they also fre- quently avoid social contacts. The peck- orders of cocks are somewhat unstable, and those of hens are relatively stable (Sanctuary, 1932; Masure and Allee, 1934). An alpha hen, "antipathies" aside, becomes tolerant of low-ranking indi- viduals. This reduction of social inter- action between individuals of widely separated ranks becomes greater between the males and the females, with the con- sequence that males normally do not peck females but tolerate them; and the females show no marked avoidance of normal males, so that typically two es- sentially unisexual peck-orders occur in a flock composed of several cocks and sev- eral hens. Carpenter (1942) has described a similar situation in his hordes of rhesus</page><page sequence="20">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 379 monkeys on Santiago Island off the coast of Puerto Rico. In a flock of intersexual Brown Leghorns, Domm and Davis (1941) found that, in general, the most masculine birds were at the top, and the most feminine were at the bottom, of the ranking among the males. The hens ap- pear to learn readily that cocks will not peck them, although they also learn to avoid a rough and sexually active cock such as II. INTERSEXUAL BEHAVIOR Hens secrete androgens, as well as estrogens, as shown by comb regression to the capon level in bilaterally ovarioto- mized hens (Domm, 1927). Koch (i937) has demonstrated by results obtained by applying the hormone to the surface of the comb that comb size can be used as an indication of the amount of androgen present. A marked correlation exists be- tween aggressiveness and comb size in normal or in testosterone-injected hens (Collias, 1943). We have records of pro- nounced masculine behavior in normal hens that merit brief attention. In a pre- vious report (Guhl, 1942) mention was made of 3 hens that wing-fluttered to other hens, and this reaction has since been observed under somewhat similar conditions in other flocks. In a more re- cent experiment the food-call appeared to be rather common among some hens, whether in the pen, out of doors, or in isolation. The crowing of hens is a well- known phenomenon. In addition to GG of flock D, 5 normal hens of a different flock than those mentioned here have been heard to crow; one of these (RG) crowed quite regularly, whether in isola- tion or in the pen with others, but in the latter case only when she was the alpha bird. We have a record of 20 unisexual mat- ings in which 3 normal hens (none of which were in the flocks discussed in this paper) took the male role with 6 differ- ent hens. None of these had received ex- perimental treatment with hormones. The vents are known to have met in io of these cases. Observations were facili- tated by the fact that the feathers in the region of the vents were lacking. Tread- ing movements with the feet were noted in 9 cases. In nearly all these instances, the hen that took the normal role of the female squatted submissively before the threatening superior before the latter mounted. When one hen (GB) trod, she everted her cloaca; and on two occa- sions when the vents failed to meet, she discharged a stream of rather clear fluid. None of the treading hens had been heard to crow. All 3 hens assuming the male position were either laying or laid within 4 days of these pseudo-matings, and all were socially dominant over the hen that was trod. No cocks were kept with these flocks. Heuser (1916) reported a case of a hen that attempted to mate 35 times, "in as perfect a manner as the best male," with 13 different individuals. This, he stated, occurred at times of egg production and nonproduction, mating and nonmating, and while the males were present or ab- sent. Heuser kept no records of social po- sition; hence we do not know the relative social dominance of his malelike hen. More observations are needed before a complete behavioristic interpretation can be attempted, but these cases do raise the question of how widely the capacity for male copulatory behavior is distribut- ed among otherwise normal hens and also what social and other conditions are re- quired to elicit this response in a female. Whitman (Carr, 1919) noted that the po- tentialities of male and female sexual behavior patterns in pigeons were almost on a par in the two sexes, and he dis-</page><page sequence="21">380 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE cusses some of the conditions under which either males or females may ex- hibit activities peculiar to the opposite sex. Androgen-treated hens became highly aggressive, and their female penmates learned to avoid them rather than to sub- mit. Since the submissive squat appears to be essential to copulation, the treated hens in our flocks did not secure the op- portunity to display the male copulatory pattern if it was induced. In the cases in which we saw unisexual mating, the treading hen, although the dominant of the pair, did not peck hard or often; in- stead she frequently elicited submission rather than avoidance. Since individuals develop special habits in relation to every individual (Tinbergen, 1931; Guhl, 1942) and since, as discussed by Allee, Collias, and Lutherman (I939), social inertia may enforce or replace aggressive behavior patterns, it appears logical to assume that habit may be important in the patterns of sex behavior shown by hormonally treated fowl. For example, when YY received a pellet of testosterone propionate, her aggressive behavior was noted in the discrimination pen (Guhl, 1942) long before it became evident in her home pen; and when she was placed in the pen of flock G for a test, she drove all these hens about their pen, but on re- turn to her own flock she assumed pair- behavior patterns in accord with her so- cial status of that day (cf. Douglis, 1944). The same dominance of learned behavior over physiological state was shown by cocks II and III, which, although capable of copulation, did not mate with the D- hens even when the suppressive influence of cock I was removed. Allee, Collias, and Lutherman (i939) found that low- ranking hens treated with androgen not only rose in the social order but main- tained their new social status long after injections had ceased and the recipient hens had lost their androgen-mediated aggressiveness. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN OBSERVED RANKINGS AMONG THE HENS Before summarizing observed correla- tions, it is necessary to pause briefly to introduce pertinent background material about flocks A6, D,,3,, and E. The rec- ords of these last three flocks were ob- tained during a total of 32 hours of ob- servations on flock A6, 35 hours on flock D39, and 8.5 hours on flock E, all during the first 8 months of 1939. Observation periods were io or 15 minutes in length and usually occurred late in the after- noon. Flocks A6 and E were composed of 6 hens; D39, of 7 hens. The basic relations are summarized in Table 8. There was a pecking triangle in flock A6 at this time; a linear pecking order existed in flock E and during about half of this period for flock D,3. Two reversals of social position occurred in flock D in the second half of the period, but these did not concern the two top birds; the social order indicated in Table 8 repre- sents the earlier situation. The data from the 1939 observations are somewhat complicated as a result of hormone treatments given in connection with other experiments. The treatments consisted of injections of estradiol ben- zoate or of thyroxin into birds selected from various social levels and, except for the higher doses of thyroxin, produced little or no effect on the rate of mating. All data are omitted from Table 8 that were recorded at the time when some of the top birds (2 hens in flock D and i in flock E) received doses of thyroxin suffi- cient markedly to depress their frequency of mating. Mention was made previously of a tendency toward a negative correlation</page><page sequence="22">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 381 between the social position of the hens in flocks D594o and F and the rates at which they were trod or gave the sexual squat. In the more careful statistical study of these matters it was decided to concentrate on data secured when each cock was with his respective flock of hens singly and successively. The presence of 3 or 4 cocks in the pen at the same time introduced complications that we have been at some pains to describe. So far as We are interested in the correlations within each flock considered as a unit and within various flock combinations. The combined correlations given in Table 9 are for the 1940 observations on D4o and F; on the 1939 observations on A6, E, and D39,; and on all the flocks considered together. In this last instance the D- flock for both years was considered as one unit and given the rank-order based on mean rate of performance.

The correlation coefficient (r) was calculated from the regression for- mula EV1V2 - VEv2, rR = EV- VEv2 2 U Further, since social status is given here summarily in terms of rank achieved rather than by listing in detail the pecks delivered and received, it is probably best to examine the correlation of social ranks with rankings based on the rates for other observed activities. parison of correlations between flocks that differ in size was accomplished by the simplest-possible treatment. The top- ranking hens were regarded as equiva- lent; so were those in bottom rank; the intermediate ranks were adjusted by simple "stretching" of the smaller num- ber of ranks to give them their appro- priate place in the larger series. The cor- relations are listed in Table 9, with the statistically significant values shown in italic type.

The correlations between social rank and the frequency of giving the sexual crouch (so-called "sex invitations") were also steadily negative. They were statisti- cally significant with the D-flocks for both years and when all observations for 1939 (A6, F, D39) are considered together. Although still negative, the value of r for</page><page sequence="24">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 383 flock F is very low. The D40 hens gave no "sex invitations" to cock II and very few to cock III. The correlations between social rank and rank based on the frequency at which the hens were courted by the cocks are also steadily negative, significantly so for D4o and for D4o plus F. While sta- tistically not significant, the negative correlations between mating and avoid- ance ranks and between those of "sex in- vitations" and avoidance are in accord- ance with expectation. The insignificant correlation between social and avoidance ranks shows that in flock F, the only one for which data are available, the social independence of the top-ranking hens in- cluded a strong tendency not to avoid the cocks. These observations do not give a basis for predicting what the behavior of the F-hens might have been in the presence of cocks with more highly de- veloped sexual initiative. Positive correlations.-The correlations between "sex invitations" and matings were uniformly high and were statistical- ly significant except for flock A6. The correlations between courting and mat- ing ranks were also all positive and were statistically significant for the F-hens and for F and D4o flocks considered to- gether. The similarly positive correla- tions between "sex invitations" and courting lack statistical significance, as does also the low correlation between courting and avoidance. Probably the most interesting of these correlations is the inverse relationship between high social rank and frequency of being trod by the cock. Our data on this point were obtained independently by two observers and are supported by certain observations in the mating pens. As Tables 3 and 8 show, in flocks A6, D (i939 and 1940), and E the alpha hens were trod at the lowest rate. The bird in flock A6 for which only 9 treadings were observed was formerly the top hen in this flock, although at the time of this experiment she was tied for third place with two other hens. The behavior of GG, in 1939 the alpha hen of flock D, is also illuminating. This hen was at that time the least trod of her flock, "invited" the cock to tread the least, laid well in comparison with the other hens, was a good fighter in staged encounters with strange hens, and the cock frequently courted and waltzed around her. Hen GG also displayed some cocklike behavior: when the cock wing- fluttered to her, she would reciprocate by waltzing around him, giving a rudimen- tary male-behavior pattern; at times she pecked at him. Only GG among the nor- mal hens of flock D was heard to crow or seen to wing-flutter in the pen. When GY and BB were transferred to flock D in 1940 from flock A6, where they were at the bottom of the peck-order, these hens moved to the top of the new hierarchy and replaced GG at the bottom of the treading order (Table 3). Although we have not attempted to make a similarly elaborate statistical analysis of the observed correlations when all cocks were placed together with their respective flocks of hens, we have compared the ranks based on the be- havior when each cock was introduced singly (Table 3) with that shown when all were present together with the hens (Table 4). The social ranks remained constant in both flocks D4o and F-the two for which data are available-during the entire period under discussion. Hen GB, of flock F, died before the second set of observations (those recorded in Table 4) were begun; but her death merely caused YR and WR to become Nos. 7 and 8, respectively, in the peck-order, rather than Nos. 8 and 9.</page><page sequence="25">384 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE All the calculated correlations between ranks based on mating, courting, so- called "sex invitations," and avoidances, with I cock present, as compared with the same reactions with 3 or 4 pres- ent, are positive. The only correlation that is statistically significant is that regarding treading ranks under the two sets of conditions. Here r = +0.8055 with a P-value of &lt;o.o0. The ranks based on courting show that r = +0.3711 (P &gt; o.i), and for "sex invi- tations" r = +0.4343 (P &gt; o0.). Data on avoidances are available for flock F only, and there r = +0.3095 (P &gt; o.I). It is possible to subject the available data to various other statistical analyses. These are all that have seemed profitable for us to discuss. We trust that the data are given in sufficient detail so that any- one interested may make such statistical and other tests as meet his needs. DISCUSSION In order to discuss the detailed ob- servations more intelligently, it may be well to pass in review, in summarized form, the correlations that we consider to be fairly valid, or at least suggestive, when all our data and experience are considered. For the hens these are pre- sented in the following informal tabula- tion. I. NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS I. Social position :frequency of mating 2. Social position frequency of being courted 3. Social position : frequency of "invit- ing" the c6ck to mate II. POSITIVE CORRELATIONS I. Frequency of giving the sexual crouch : frequency of mating 2. Frequency of being courted fre- quency of mating In addition, there were suggestions of a positive correlation in each test made between frequency of being courted and the frequency of giving "sex invitations." All these correlations are consistent wherever cross-checking is possible. The interesting negative correlation between ranks based on frequency of mating and social rank requires further discussion. Our results at this point are to be contrasted with those of Skard (1937), who obtained a positive correla- tion of 0.53-0.55 (P-value about 0.05) between mating "preference" and the peck-order with one cock and a statisti- cally insignificant positive value of only 0.24 with the same cock in another flock of hens. The performance of a second cock, Skard says, "does not show any conformity with the first cock's prefer- ences." Skard obtained her "mating-prefer- ence" order (a) by summing all the ap- proaches of her cocks to the different hens or (b) by considering weighted values for different recognizable aspects of male-initiated sex behavior, with a value of I for each "weak impulse" and of 6 for each copulation. Skard's recorded data do not indicate either the sign or the degree of correlation that she found for either sex between rank in the peck- order and the number of actual copula- tions; hence they are not directly com- parable with our results. Murchison (I935b) reports a positive correlation between the number of times a hen was trod and the distance she traveled toward another hen in his "so- cial reflex runway." The hen that trav- eled farthest had the highest frequency in mating. He found also (1935a) that the hen traveling the greater distance in his special runway dominated the other of the contact-pair in physical combats. Hence, in our terminology,</page><page sequence="26">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 385 Murchison found a positive correlation between rank based on the number of times a hen is mated and her rank in the peck-order of the female flock. He ob- served 292 copulations between 5 pullets and 3 cocks and gives no statistical anal- ysis. An examination of his published records, using the statistical methods we have applied to our own data (in which we based mating rank on the total ob- served treadings for each hen) indicates a positive coefficient of correlation (r) of i.o when 0.9587 would have a statistical probability (P-value) of o.oi. Pertinent differences of Murchison's (i935b) meth- ods of observation from ours are as fol- lows: (a) Observations on mating were made when his birds were 16-48 weeks old. (Sixteen weeks is an unusually early age at which to expect sexual maturity.) (b) The dominance relationships among the pullets were determined in the "so- cial-reflex runway" when they were about 32 weeks old, or 16 weeks after ob- servations on matings began. (c) The mating data obtained when cockerels were used singly and successively were pooled, without distinction, with those recorded when all the males were penned with the pullets. (d) Murchison does not describe the cage in which the pullets were housed with the cockerels. We have, therefore, no way of knowing whether the matings Murchison observed are comparable with ours, made under other conditions and on a different breed. In our flocks the over-all correlation between social rank and ranked fre- quency in mating is regularly negative rather than positive-and significantly so, according to accepted statistical standards, when larger numbers of com- parisons are made. It is interesting to note that Schjelderup-Ebbe (i935), whose observations we have often veri- fied, also reported that his top-ranking hens mated less frequently than those with low social status. Schjelderup-Ebbe presented naturalistic observations only without supporting statistical analysis. We can make some tentative sugges- tions concerning the important discrep- ancy between our observations, together with those of Schjelderup-Ebbe, and the findings of Murchison and probably of Skard. We know that differences in an- cestry, in previous history, in housing, and in treatment often produce impor- tant differences in behavior. Hens high in the social order have greater freedom of movement. Such freedom can be im- portant in allowing more frequent meet- ing of dominant hens with somewhat sluggish cocks; and Murchison's cocks may all have been sluggish, since 3 of his 6 cocks did not mate. Contrariwise, a negative correlation between mating and social rank may well be the normal rela- tionship when cocks show the usual amount of sexual initiative. Under such conditions the greater tendency of hens low in the social order to give the sub- missive sexual crouch did much to de- termine mating frequency. Skard's ex- perience (1937), like ours, shows that there are differences between flocks even under similar experimental conditions; and doubtless there are still greater dif- ferences under the divergent conditions used by different investigators. Perhaps there are differences between breeds. The situation is not simple and be- comes less so when other social relations are considered. Despite the advantage of a high social level of aggressiveness in competitions for food and space, beyond some undefined point, female aggressive- ness appears to interfere with the mating process. Also, beyond a considerably higher level, aggressiveness of a cock toward associated hens-cock II, for ex- ample-lessens his chances for mating.</page><page sequence="27">386 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE When different cocks were introduced singly and successively into the pen of the hens, individual differences were re- vealed in courting and mating habits and in the relative frequency of these activi- ties. The individual differences, though sometimes statistically valid, were not startling until after the cocks had been placed together simultaneously with the hens. Then followed, especially with flock D, a severe conditioning of certain sub- ordinate cocks. This was continued until the individuals were sexually suppressed so far as these hens were concerned, even in the absence of the alpha cock. The suppressed males were less effective even when they were introduced singly into a flock of strange hens (Table 6). Heuser (1916), who did not describe peck-orders among his birds, found evi- dence of sexual suppression among males that he related to constitutional vigor. He stated: "It is generally believed that males of high constitutional vigor will overcome the low vigor birds and pre- vent their mating. However this is not always true, as shown by the behavior of 'black,' one of the low vigor birds, that had third highest number of matings al- though chased and bullied by all the other males in the pen." This suggests a peck-order relation to what he calls "constitutional vigor." If one could as- sume that rank in vigor is correlated with social position, one could find parallels between his results and those presented in this paper, such as: (a) "high-vigor" males mated more frequently than medi- um or "low-vigor" males; (b) "low- vigor" females mated, on the average, more frequently than hens with high "constitutional vigor"; and (c) the cor- relation between "constitutional vigor" of the females and mating power is weak- er than with the males; it is also negative with hens and positive with cocks. Murchison (1935b) found that 3 of his 6 cocks did not mate with the hens with which all of them were associated. This may have been an unrecognized instance of sexual suppression similar to that shown diagrammatically in our 1940 D-flock. In his flock, the alpha, beta, and omega cocks did all the treading. In our flock D, males with intermediate ranks also were suppressed. We found evidence of so-called "favoritism" between cocks I and IV. There is no recorded reason why Murchison's omega cock trod hens when those in third, fourth, and fifth ranks did not. Our observations on domestic fowl un- der laboratory conditions may be com- pared to some others made on another gallinaceous species in nature. Simon (1940) and Scott (1942) studied the mat- ing behavior of the sage grouse (Centro- cercus urophasianus) and found basic be- havior phenomena that bear rather close resemblance to those of Gallus domesticus. During the breeding season the cocks of the sage grouse develop a dominance organization composed of a master-cock, a subcock, 3-6 guard cocks, and a vari- able number of "outside" or isolated cocks. A formalized "wing-beating" con- stitutes the chief manner of fighting be- tween the males. The hens are more pas- sive but may peck other females. Strut- ting increases in the presence of females, and mating by inferior males appears to stimulate an attack on the copulating cock. The hens initiate coition by a squatting reaction in front of a cock. Satiation on the part of the master-cock may cause receptive hens to crouch be- fore a subcock or guard cock (Scott, 1944). At daybreak and again during the late afternoon the cocks gather at their strutting grounds and arrange them- selves in a number of dominance orders. The hens enter the assembly later and</page><page sequence="28">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 387 appear to avoid a poorly integrated group of cocks engaged in much fighting. In these particular observations the master-cocks were involved in 74 per cent of the matings, the subcocks ob- tained 13 per cent of the copulations, and the guard cocks 3 per cent. The more nu- merous isolated cocks at the edge of the breeding area secured less than io per cent of the total matings observed. It should probably be noted that neither Simon nor Scott stated that the observed cocks were marked and recognized as individuals. These conditions strongly re- semble the situation that we have de- scribed for flock D4o when all cocks were present together. Skard (1937) was apparently im- pressed by the so-called mating prefer- ences in her flocks. Warren and Kilpat- rick (1929) found evidence of "preferen- tial mating," since three of their hens did not mate with one of the cocks although they did with others introduced alone into the pen. Almost all students of the social behavior of the domestic fowl, from Schjelderup-Ebbe (1922) on, have seen reactions that can most briefly be char- acterized by the anthropomorphic terms of preference and its opposite, antipathy. We have not yet had better illustrations of such reactions than the antagonistic behavior of cock I of flock D40 toward cock II or by his weak reaction ("prefer- ential behavior") to the aggression of the otherwise well-subordinated cock IV. We found little evidence that the males which we observed gave marked positive or negative attention to par- ticular hens. As a rule, the gradation was fairly gradual from the most- to the least- trod hen. Exceptions did occur. For ex- ample, when introduced singly, cock II mated with RW at the rate of 2.40 times per hour and with BR 2.20 per hour, but with the hen third in mating frequency, at the rate of only 1.25 per hour. Al- though cock II courted GG at a fairly high rate, he mated with her infrequent- ly. Cock III copulated much more fre- quently with BR, cock V (flock F) with YR, and cock VIII with YR, than was to be expected on the basis of their treading of other hens. Cock I, when with the F-hens, may have avoided mat- ing with YB and RB. When 4 cocks were together in the flock at one time, I and IV mated more with one individual (YY) than with any of the others. These particular instances of mating "preferences" or "antipathies" may have been the result of the small sample rather than a reality; it would not be surprising if they were real. On the other hand, these differences in the rates at which a given male mates with several hens may be as much a matter of the reactions of the individual hens toward the male as of the behavior of the cock toward the dif- ferent hens. Some evidence in this regard is fairly apparent in Table 8 and in the avoidance shown by the hens of flock D40 to cocks II and III in their later as- sociation with those sexually suppressed individuals. However, an adequate dis- cussion of this phase of mating behavior would lead us beyond the scope of the present report. Finally, what is the evidence that the social position of an individual or its sexual-behavior complex may affect its reproductive success? It is obvious that a socially suppressed cock loses much of his opportunity for mating. It is prob- able that sexual suppression of a cock need not be carried to the point of psy- chological castration to produce a reduc- tion in the number of his progeny. Crew (1926) and Warren and Kilpatrick (1929) report that the competitive efficiency of sperm may be of relatively short duration (about 3 days) and that sperm of a new</page><page sequence="29">388 A. M. GUHL, N. E. COLLIAS, AND W. C. ALLEE male may supplant those of a preceding mate. Malbandov and Card (1943) found that eggs fertilized by stale (senescent) sperm show an increase in failure to hatch in proportion to the age of the sperm, although no significant differences in embryo mortality occurred until the sperm were more than io days old. They concluded that "it is possible that unpopularity of individual hens with males and insufficient number of males may cause some hens to lay fertile eggs that are incapable of hatching be- cause they were fertilized by stale sperm." Fertilization by artificial insemi- nation depends, among other factors, upon the concentration of sperm (Mun- ro, 1938; Hartman, 1939). Kosin (1944) demonstrated that the numerical rela- tionship between functionally active germ cells and those functionally inac- tivated by X-rays determine the propor- tion of eggs fertilized by the specimen of semen treated. Parker and Spadden (1943) found that inanition decreased the semen volume, the number of sper- matozoa per collection, and the fertiliz- ing capacity of the males. Lamoreux (194.0) in a study of in- fertility of fowl lists, among other fac- tors, some causes of infertility that may be influenced by heterosexual behavior, such as "preferential mating," number of matings, and the time elapsed since last mating. All the evidence at hand indi- cates that these factors may be influ- enced by the individuality of the cocks and, to a lesser degree, by that of the hens. They are also affected by the learned pair-reaction patterns of the hens and the cocks. The already complicated problem is rendered still more complex by indica- tions that in the domestic fowl the com- petition between cocks for mates does not end when a given cock is successful in matings. The sperm from successive matings by two individuals may con- tinue to compete in the reproductive tract of the hens both by numerical ad- vantage and by relative physiological virility. This problem is being directly attacked by one of us with attention to all the known variables (cf. Guhl, War- ren, and Payne, 1944). There can be no doubt but that social dominance among males, whether of G. domesticus, the sage grouse (Simon, 1940; Scott, 1942), or rhesus mon- keys (Carpenter, 1942), allows the domi- nant animal an opportunity to sire more offspring. The relation between high so- cial status and reproductive success of common hens is not so obvious. Sanctu- ary (1932) found that hens from the low- er half of the peck-order lay fewer eggs than do their more aggressive flockmates. The high-ranking hens obtain more food and otherwise lead more secure lives. Op- posed to these trends, there is the tend- ency for socially high-ranking hens to mate less frequently than those lower in the social scale. In our small flocks each hen mated frequently enough to insure fertile eggs and viable offspring. A pre- liminary report of a direct test (Guhl, Warren, and Payne, 1944) of the subject indicates that, despite the negative cor- relation with mating frequency, high- ranking hens, as well as cocks, produce more offspring than their low-ranking flockmates. SUMMARY i. Approximately 1,630 treadings of domestic fowl were observed and studied in relation to associated behavior and so- cial status. 2. Statistically significant negative correlations were found between the so- cial position of the hens and the fre- quencies at which they were courted by the cocks.</page><page sequence="30">MATING BEHAVIOR AND THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY 389 3. Although rarely statistically signifi- cant in any given flock, there was a con- sistent tendency toward a negative cor- relation between the frequency at which the hens were mated and their position in the social order that became statisti- cally significant when results from differ- ent flocks were considered together. 4. In 4 out of 5 flocks the hens highest in the social order either failed to "in- vite" the cock to mate or crouched less frequently than most of their penmates. The consistent negative correlation be- tween social rank and the frequency of giving the sexual crouch was suggested but not proved by our data. 5. There was a high correlation in all observed flocks between the number of times the individual hens were mated and their frequencies in giving "sex invi- tations" to the males. 6. There was no statistically signifi- cant relationship between the social sta- tus of the cock in his unisexual group and his sexual activities when placed alone in a flock of hens. However, when 4 cocks were introduced together into a relatively small but uncrowded pen con- taining hens, a form of suppression de- veloped which practically inhibited mat- ing behavior by some of the low-ranking cocks and demonstrated that the domi- nant males possess a greater freedom to mate and so sire more offspring than their socially inferior penmates.
