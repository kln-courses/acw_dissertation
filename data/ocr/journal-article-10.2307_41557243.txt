<plain_text><page sequence="1">Faunal by Peter Reading (Tarset: Bloodaxe, 2002) ISBN 1-85224-587-5 ALAN MAHAR Elegant Biodiversity The carefully metrical field notes of Peter Reading prove what has only been hinted at before: that amongst poets he is the expert bird- watcher (only Michael Longley is capable of more plangency in ornithology); also that in birders' field guides there is a 'found' poetry awaiting discovery. Reading rejects the anthropomorphism of Ted Hughes just as he dismisses the 'plashy fen school' of nature notes versifiers. On a Texas field trip in Faunal with Reading, we get the binoculars, the Latin names and the key identification features too:</page><page sequence="2">130 Critical Survey, Volume 15, Number 3 Johnston and I were observing a posse of Whooping Cranes (Grus Americana), titanium white in crisp focus through the Bausch and Lomb, red facial skin, black primaries, and a Goddam wingspan of eighty-seven inches. Or on an Amtrak train looking through the Club Car window: pink Scissor-tails migrating with the fall and vultures southbound for the borderline. Or: 'scanning the hoared-land blacked with Brantasí And, in their centre, a single Snow Goose.' Reading can be effortlessly lyrical. You do not have to be a twitcher to see he treats his meticulous record of rare sightings as 'secular epiphaniď. The Whooping Cranes poem ends: 'And we knew, we knew we would die without seeing the species again.' Typically, he also pretends to undercut their epiphanic status - each one, merely to be remembered (against extinction) - requiring, as he twice archly remarks, 'no fancy moral/or intellectual envoi.' He even finishes one with tongue-in-cheek boffin talk ('notch it up, therefore, Deborah, while you may'). In the book's last poem 'Afflations' he sends himself up: after neat verses devoted to a Nankeen Night Heron: 'And I'd say (if I entertained/such mawkish conceits) that on each/ of these afflatious encounters/ my soul ascended like that/ Skylark I watched as I lay/ and dreamed' on a Shropshire upland. This may be romantic pastoral parody, but Reading still, at some level, means it. He wants it both ways: tough and tender, contempo- rary and antique: always complex. A verse to a brother begins calmly: 'Last night I dreamed of the red-finned, bronze-girthed Rudd', but ends horrifically, four lines later: 'your back bent double with chemo'. There are some (not me) who will find that distasteful; but sometimes Reading's range of registers is truly hair-raising. His position is as aggressively Darwinist as Richard Dawkins (he claims the phrase 'struggle for existence' from Origin of Species for his epigraph), An encounter between an Alligator mississippiensis and a Green heron ( Butoides virescens) ends with a cunning escape, as the bird 'edges back along its twig/with the choreographed dexterity/of a survivor.' In Mexico, after recording the names rhythmically 'Steller's Jay, Pygmy Nuthatch', he celebrates his awe: 'Later, vinum sacrum/to properly honour this day/ of secular epiphaniď. These are precious observations logged scrupulously, in the face of mortality, environ-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 131 mental suicide and the stupidity of homo sapiens. Savage indignation shows through stingingly in two poems about myxomatosis, most vividly in a fifties' schoolroom, with Ma Hope's epidiascope. There is a curious, long polyphonic sequence, a fragmentary pseudo-Darwinian journal, where Homeric gore and brutality are rather obviously juxtaposed against a Victorian gentleman naturalist's trips to offshore islands. In one, the search for St. Brendan ends with the witty contemplation of a crinoid fossil (age: a few hundred million вс). Whereas at Hilbre Island the narrator is shocked by a Peregrine which 'stooped from a cloud the colour of Blaenau Ffestiniog slate' and savaged a Sanderling flock ( Calidris alba). 'We heard the thud and a handful of silvern feathers/whorled in the wind'. That is just one more pin-sharp natural history photograph in Reading's brilliant appreciation of 'elegant biodiversity'.</page></plain_text>
