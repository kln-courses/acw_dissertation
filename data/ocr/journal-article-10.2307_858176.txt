<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RECENT CRITICISM OF BLAKE t BY ROBERT ROSS F Catherine Blake were permit- ted to revisit the glimpses of the moon in order to find.her hus- band's bones at Bunhill Fields, her task, unlike that of the god- dess Isis, would be easier than a reconstruction of her husband's scattered identity. It is satisfac- tory to think that Blake would have enjoyed this state of affairs, if he were allowed to hear of it, because he would have discovered a profound symbol in the differences of his commentators, while no one would have resented more than he the attempts of any national Art-Collections Fund to stay the tide of his Prophetic Books ebbing to America. Though Mr. de S61lincourt1 denies him (we think wrongly) any sense of humour, it is possible to think of the petulant epigram with which some of the interpreters might have been gibbeted. With the exception of Gilchrist, still the canon for students, nearly all the writers on Blake have hitherto treated him as a mirror in which they have sought their own anticipated reflexion, or at all events a mirror before which they could indulge in diverting literary contortions. Mr. Swinburne was the first to try the 'All Hallow E'en' experiment. With Gilchrist for a candle he entered fearlessly the darkened room. He saw, or thought he saw, in the glass a mid-Victorian of the eighteenth century, an elo- quent atheist of the sixties, with an exaggerated opinion of second-rate Elizabethan poets : he saw Victor Hugo and Shelley and a great many other things. But he obviously never saw William Blake; or let us say that the actuality of the apparition is discutable. His delightful study is more obscure than the most abstruse of Blake's own Prophetic Books. Mr. W. B. Yeats a good many years later rushed the mysterious chamber on the threshold of which angels had stumbled; but without bruising his shins. He was equipped with all the jaeger armour of the cabbalists. Mr. Ellis held the lantern. Both critics were very scornful about Swinburne and the Rossettis, whose pioneer polar researches they discounted and discredited. And then they looked in the mirror and saw a combination of an 1' William Blake.' By Basil de S lincourt.

Mr. Arthur Symons did one good service in exploding an Irish origin for the author of 'Songs of Innocence.' In acknowledging the scholarly care with which Mr. Symons approached his materials, it would be gracious to suggest that he at least had been caught up to the seventh heaven; but an observation quoted by Mr. de S6lincourt (on page 71) warns us that even to him Blake's message 'has never been made clear.' 'When Blake spoke the first word of the nineteenth century, there was no one to hear it,' says Mr. Arthur Symons, who, stepping deftly over the ddbris of Messrs. Ellis and Yeats, only sees in Blake a predecessor of the rather languid English school of symbolists-that school which mistook ten years of the late Queen's reign for the whole nineteenth century. In fact Mr. Symons too, sought and found his own reflexion-a remarkable self- cultured personality with keen perceptions and high poetic gifts, remote and unrelated to the immediate life around it. The painter of the Spiritual Form of Pitt guiding Behemoth and the Spiritual Form of Nelson guiding Leviathan was obviously concerned not 'in emancipation from reality through the shaping spirit of imagination,' but in spiritualizing reality, in capturing the rapture of commonplace for poetry, in visualizing, through the limited mediums of form and colour, a philosophy which can only be rendered (and then imperfectly) by language. It sounds a terribly Philistine thing to say, but there is little doubt that Blake would have hardly slipped into temporary oblivion if he had been better educated, either as an artist or a man of letters. We should have lost something of course. Cambridge would have anaestheticized his genius. Oxford would have sapped his manhood. Yet it must be confessed that perhaps the greatest artistic and philosophic genius of the English eighteenth century can never occupy his thrones in the temples of art and literature because he was never sufficiently equipped to prove his titles. No one has really deciphered those hieroglyphs so imperfectly and sometimes exquisitely wrought. The real wonder is that anyone as inarticulate should have found the many contemporary admirers he did. The cir- cumstance of his unintelligibility has naturally endeared him to solvers of literary and artistic acrostics. Just as every religious community finds its own Yale key to the'Revelations,' every poet or artist may find his apology in the apocalypse of William Blake. They should be careful not to confuse apocrypha with apocalypse. Too many enthusiasts have suggested that Blake was a kind of snark, 'ages ahead of the fashion'; whereas he was simply the greatest mind which attached itself to a movement of which Chatterton, Horace Walpole, Beckford and Percy were component parts. It was Mr. Sturge Moore, we believe, who pointed out that Blake's Gothic proclivities were really a symptom of the age-the age of Strawberry Hill and Fonthill, and of what is known as churchwarden gothic. It does not deprive him of the distinction that he was much nearer an understanding of mediaevalism than more learned contemporaries. His Canterbury Pilgrims is a brilliant guess. Just as Botticelli's Birth of Venus tells us more of the Greek idea than Bohn's cribs to the classics, Blake's interpre- tation of Chaucer was far more advanced, more illuminating than Tyrwhitt. The suggestion of Mr. Symons that there was no one to hear Blake's messages is nonsense. The man, the artist, and the poet were deeply appreciated by such different critics as Lamb, Flaxman, Wordsworth, Varley, and Linnell, to name only a few. We find connoisseurs like Sir Thomas Lawrence and Beckford among the subscribers to his books: even the Royal Family offered him a situation as drawing master! Perhaps in regard to the 'message' of his philosophy Mr. Symons is right; there were no philosophers in England to understand it. And we cannot understand it now for a similar reason. The brilliant flashes of thought in lan- guage, line, or colour, the daring aphorisms are improved by isolation from their context; they are not the keystones of a mental architecture. Blake died in 1827; and the succeeding genera- tion which neglected him, it must be remem- bered, neglected Shelley and Keats. The pleasure- loving Byronic materialistic society of the Regency, the practical machine-loving early Victorians were engaged by other interests, not so attractive, but no less essential than the nebulous message, if message there was, of William Blake. 'Messages,' said Mr. Charles Whibley the other day, 'have a habit of dying;' and that of Blake, whatever it may have been, is probably dead along with the rest. The intellectual apparatus with which he was endowed was probably the rarest that has ever been vouchsafed to an English artist or poet. He was either too uneducated, or too mad, or too unskilful to make the apparatus work. His limited powers of expression paralyzed alike his genius, his art and his reputation. From a somewhat different point of view Mr. Basil de Sdlincourt has realized all this. Since Gilchrist's 'Life' this is the first study of William Blake that can be regarded as a serious interpretative estimate of the mystic artist, the lyric poet, the unintelligible philosopher. The only possible objection to be urged against the book as an art publication is obviated by an explanatory note on page 345. Here we learn the reason of the inadequate illus- trations. Owners of originals have refused assis- tance or promised the rights of reproduction to others. We cannot help thinking that, had the collectors any idea of Mr. de S61incourt's capacity, they would scarcely have withheld their 85</page><page sequence="3">A Recent Criticism of Blake co-operation. Nevertheless since the exigencies of Messrs Duckworth's series confine the repro- ductions to half-tone blocks, it is hardly to be regretted. Blake's colour and Blake's design require some other process to give the faintest idea of their qualities. Then, so much of the letterpress being destructive and hostile, the half- tones certainly reproduce faithfully enough the ineptitudes on which the writer insists, without emphasizing unduly the merits he occasionally acknowledges. To Blake specialists there may come a slight feeling of irritation at Mr. de S61in- court's attitude. Those visiting a shrine do not find their enjoyment enhanced by being told that the relics are not genuine, and that seventy-five per cent. of the miracles are fakes, especially when their informant is one of the sacristans. In the famous plate of The Soul Exploring the Recesses of the Grave he sees an 'entire absence of design; the utter disconnectedness of Soul below and body above; the hideous and lifeless mannerism dis- played in the figure of the body combine to reduce the painter's symbolic devices to an offence; to convince us that whatever the soul is, it is never a curious woman prying with a candle into dark corners.' Of one of the finest tempera pictures, Gray's Bard, he makes similar fun. And though much of this cold rationalistic treatment is wholesome and wel- come after the nonsense that others have written, it suggests that Mr. de S6lincourt is congenitaly in- capable of appraising or understanding Blake's art. That he is, however, perfectly equipped, that he has enormous capacity for estimating it, the remark- able chapters on 'The Theory of Imagination,' 'Symbolism in Poetry and Art,' and 'The Confines of Poetry and Painting' prove conclusively. Some- times he slips on the platform of his own criticism. Though accepting the Job series as a masterpiece, he observes, ' if we are at first sight shocked to find the Almighty depicted as an old man with a flow- ing beard, hardly in His physiognomy distinguish- able from Job himself, the error is explained, and we condone it because adequate treatment of the theme would clearly be impossible.' Who are 'we' ? Mr. de S61incourt ranges himself on the side of the Angel Tatham in allowing himself to be so easily scandalised. No one would suspect that the author of that sentence could have ever examined any old masters at all. We cannot help thinking that he forgets the conventions of the Roman and Byzan- tine mosaics, where physiognomy is hardly ever differentiated, and the distinction of sex is only indicated by costume. This condoning and for- giveness of Blake is entirely superfluous. It is true that Reynolds, while breaking Italian art gently to his protestant audience, apologized for the repre- sentation of the Supreme Being in the old masters ; but his observation was dictated by convention rather than conviction. And need we refer a scholar such as Mr. de S61lincourt to the rigid Egyptian uniformity in the presentation of deities for ritual or religious compositions ? Blake with some justice claimed to have conversed with the artists of Syria and Egypt, though he might have found among the hated Greeks a later precedent for monotony of facial type. Against Mr. de S6lincourt he would have defended himself, how- ever, not on artistic grounds, but on the mystical interpretation of the Supreme Being in Job-a Supreme Being who would logically appear a god made in Job's own image, the spiritual projection of Job's own imagination. Two such entirely different artists as Burne-Jones and Mr. Sargent have adopted the same primitive hieratic treatment for their designs, of which the motive necessitated Jahvistic anthropomorphism. A physiographical or separate characterisation of the Deity would have resulted in disaster. Mr. de S61lincourt has here, we think, fallen into an error of criticism. With one other exception, his further strictures on Blake's art and his generalizations are mostly matters of agreement or disagreement. 'Subjects such as Time, or Death, or Eternity are hardly calculated in themselves to inspire a painter's imagination' is one of the opinions to which admirers of Michelangelo, Tiepolo and the late G. F. Watts are not likely to subscribe. But when we are told that ' the spirit of Nonconformity ran in Blake's veins from the first,' and, again, 'He was an active Nonconformist to the end; the Dissidence of Dissent seldom attracted a more whole-hearted worshipper,' we can only meet such statements by reference to those intelligible por- tions of the Prophetic Books which strike at the very foundation of Nonconformist ethics. If the dignity of the so-called sinner, the doctrine of original virtue do not belong to Christianity, orthodox or other, Blake's ritualistic mentality, his hieratic bias, the bold anachronism by which he introduces a Gothic cathedral into the background of his Job series and elsewhere, his overcharged symbolism, are all anathema to Nonconformity. It would be easier and no less shallow to maintain that he was a Roman Catholic in spirit because of his sentimental attachment to Catholicism, which he defended, according to Gilchrist, as the only true form of Christianity, and from which, of course, he derived, in common with other artists, so much of his inspiration ; more, perhaps, than any of his contemporaries. For that reason he has been claimed as the first religious painter since the Reformation. He was certainly the only English one before the advent of the Preraphaelites. Mr. de Sdlincourt is on much surer ground when he is telling us what Blake was not than when he is trying to tell us what he was and is. As a critical besom the book is invaluable, and is excellent preliminary reading for the more constructive study of Mr. Archibald Russell, still awaited with 86</page><page sequence="4">A Recent Criticism of Blake some impatience. Mr. de S6lincourt, like other commentators of whom we spoke, entered on his knees the dark shrine of Blake's genius with all the adjuncts of worship-the incense, the note- book, and Gilchrist's life. He emerges on his feet. He has fitted up the whole place with electric light, and invites everyone to come and see how disappointing it all is.</page></plain_text>
