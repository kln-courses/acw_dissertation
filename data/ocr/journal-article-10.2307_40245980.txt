<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science Fiction as Trivialliteratur: Some Methodological Considerations LUK DE VOS A diachronical study of a given society and its aesthetical ex- pressions, in particular its literature, requires an approach from a new methodological point of view. Two aspects should be con- sidered in this connection: 1.) questions such as "Does this topic belong to our science?" or "Do our axioms correspond to the classical rules?" are often raised. Many scientists cease to set the rules for their object of study. They cannot get beyond the tra- ditional concepts and terminology governing their discipline. To avoid this danger of terminological restriction, a new definition and dynamic objectives must be drafted; and 2.) a synchronie, abstract and objective method of classificatory description has to be applied.1 The criteria for such a classification should depend upon the interrelations between the form of the given society, in its historical and structural evolution, and its communication^ behavior. Both principles will be developed in our analysis, since texts are a means of social communication. Nevertheless, when they stand also for ethical systems with didactic purposes (or responses to them), no analysis will do without extrapolation and hypotheses added. These should result from statistical and text- analytical data. Statistical, to show the social relevance, impact, ideology, etc. of literature and to uncover the means of its pro- duction and diffusion. Text-analytical, to indicate the incorpora- tion of seemingly temporal phenomena into a larger context. Its historical basis refers to non-literary processes that define the dif- ferent forms and treatment of a fictional reality. In this way, con- tinuity and discontinuity in literary history are logically explained. However, these readjustments would be largely ineffectual if the scientist's attitude toward any aesthetical expression or arti- fact (picture, statue, literary work of art, etc.) didn't change radi- cally. Indeed, the literary work of art, for example, has too long been studied as an autonomous object, only insofar as the social processes were explicitly mentioned within the fictional reality, that is. In other words, it was treated as a mimesis-problem, but never as an exponent, a causally linked creation to these processes.2 Finally, misconceptions have strengthened the isolated and a- 4</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERA TUR 5 social position of art and, thus, of literature in modern society. Due to a very strong commercial relevance, for instance, the ten- dency towards individualizing still increases. Some symptoms are the appearance of the best-seller; the "invention" of so-called World Literature; the serials, whether identified with the name of the author (as in the case of Agatha Christie, Max Brand, Alex- andre Dumas, or Georges Simenon) or the main character (James Bond, Jo Durand, Ellery Queen, or the strip-heroes) or even the name of the serial (Laf font's Série Noire, Sphere's Occult /Non- Fiction, etc.). Or another example: a completely detached history of literature only results from a persistent, though non-sensical independence of each field of scientific research. The sociology of literature, social psychology, comparative literature, and inter- disciplinary research, however, may soon reduce the monopoly of traditional methods of analysis to their true proportions. I Nevertheless, one might meet with the difficulty of not recog- nizing certain preliminary problems because of their self-evidence. The choice of the object, for one thing, or the material to be treated are traditionally not felt as possible falsifications in them- selves which, none the less, they are, at least in some respects, and particularly with regard to their social relevance.3 Although our common language already contains a hidden ideo- logical preference, the rules and the patterns of evaluation applied to the object deform reality into a mechanical succession of culmi- nating points. At the same time, several risks endanger the coher- ence and exactness of the traditional approach: lack of logical process-forming, oversimplification, description without either causal basis or applicable interpretation, and especially incom- pleteness and partiality. There is no better example than general history. Traditional history is chronological history, not explanatory history. It de- scribes facts, but does not explain tendencies. Consequently, its important characteristics - a linear conception of progressive evo- lution and an aristocratic and schematic-synthetical representa- tion - generated exclusive studies only. A system linking mere relations between striking events, when projected against its social background, represents the products and realizations of the upper classes. It is not hard to recognize this alienating world-vision by its extreme degree of abstraction and concentration: practically, by considering the patterns of individual achievements and the false importance attributed to personalities, scholars and artists. Our approach aims precisely at restoring the value of the spans</page><page sequence="3">6 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES between the piers. Feats of arms are to be replaced by socio- economic fluctuations and the spiral evolution of the social clas- ses. The history of society is a history of the masses, not of the leaders.4 The history of literature, formerly a study of Nobel Prize winners and elite-literature, actually becomes or should become an analysis of popular culture in the first place, of Trivtalliteratur. Consequently, immanent structures of beliefs, ideology, leitmotive, and reality itself are to be revealed. Great authors who, according to Goldmann, have a "world -vision," are then reduced to their real social value5 and explained according to their social situation and commitments rather than traced from different periods in their one-dimensional literary context. Integration and the concept of totality should be aimed at, not only within a given science but also on a larger scale: "Immer wieder wird man versuchen, die Geschichte der einzelnen Wissenschaften im Zuge einer in sich geschlossenen Entwicklung vorzutragen .... Wenn . . . die Lite- raturgeschichte mitten in einer Kurve steht, so ist diese Krise nur Teilerscheinung einer sehr viel allgemeineren. Die Literaturge- schichte ist nicht nur eine Disziplin, sondern in ihrer Entwicklung selbst ein Moment der allgemeinen Geschichte."6 The neglected products of popular culture thus having become the object of study, synthetizing authors lose their socio-aesthetical monopoly. Movements, at the time influential, but temporarily neglected, (e.g. the Middle Age's satanic or alchemistic literature) should re- gain their relative and correct level of importance. Evidently, these modifications will readjust the history of human societies. The myth of "uncivilized" working classes has only prolonged their unjustifiable assimilation to the cultural dominance of a non-popular, intellectual upper-class, a failure even Marxism could not avoid sharing. Indeed, social realism largely copies nineteenth- century bourgeois systems, concepts of aestheticism and ideas on the illusion of art reflecting reality:7 Caliban only recognizing Adonis in the mirror. The first step towards a reinterpretation of literary history is two-fold: a shift in the choice of the subject and a negation of any closed system; in other words, the recognition of the inter- dependence of all products of human activity; in particular, recog- nition of socio-economic, political and cultural integration. The field of analysis being broadened enormously, one might sooner try to limit one's approach as to the range of the object, and not the descriptive ramifications, the denotation and structuralization of the object.8 Therefore, this article will be exclusively con- cerned with only one form of Trivialliteratur, science fiction.</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERA TUR 7 If we accept that literature, then, is a product of historically ex- plicable structures of a given society and its proper ideological infra- structure,9 we must take care to avoid the mistake of constructing a static typology.10 The traditional division in the literary creation is based on its relationship to the reified notion of "society" and asserts that a literary work of art is parallel to, opposed to, or averted from society. Such a typology remains inadequate. The ab- stract, static category of society-opposed works of art, for instance, might refer at the same time to anti-fascist or anti-communist in- spirations (given the situation in Europe about 1930 in the U.S.S.R. and Italy) and the writings of the authors of these countries; or, given the Spanish Civil War, the attitude of George Orwell or Roy Campbell towards its significance. The idealistic misconception of static and independent structures should be replaced by a new typology, grounded on the dynamic dialectic process. The fundamental opposition between society-opposed and society-involved literature contains no static categories, even when the second group may be divided into liter- airy works of art with regressive, unchanged, or progressive effect. The definitions of these categories remain open to development.11 With the fundamental dynamics of ideology itself (the clue to our typology), a dynamic conception is assured. In the actual context, the term "regressive literary works of art" indicates those trying to preserve the type of society the writer is living in. They cause an increasing distance between immobilized social structures and the attitudinal evolution of mankind. Models are often found in the past, and the most important characteristic is the intended freezing of the time-dimension. A cynical allegory can be found in the deliberate fascism of Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream. Works expressing revolt, from Swift to Capek, often belong to the second group, the unchanged type. Since my theoretical sys- tem clearly starts from intentional functions, one could define this category in the negative: actually, in such works, no use is made of existing social structures in order to apply a necessary dialectical method to transform their society into a more social- ized ideal. This aim is to a certain degree realized by the progressive move- ment (e.g., Mack Reynolds, Commune 2000 A.D.). That the re- gressive and society-opposed groups are largely dominant cannot surprise us. This fact undoubtedly reflects the inherent conserva- tism of hierarchical structures, typical for liberal types of economy and Western forms of organizations (including governmental struc- tures). Therefore, Trivialliteratur, being most affected by com- mercial needs and fluctuations, will easily respond to any analy-</page><page sequence="5">8 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES sis of these structural inequalities for three main reasons: its the- matic and ideological simplification, its high degree of socio-eco- nomic integration, and its quantitative importance. A danger to which all forms of cultural expression are subjected in one respect or another consists in various degrees of mystifi- cation. Yet, it is the differing nature of this mystification that pro- vides us with another subsidiary but nonetheless all-embracing ar- gument why Trivialliteratur may be preferred to Weltliteratur as an object of study. The reduction in the number of literary works treated, for one thing, results from the synthetic character of academic literature; ideological concentration, springing from this, leads to its being interpreted as exemplary and specific. Since the authors are then being regarded as movement-makers, a double falsification is brought about: 1.) the veneration of synthetic writers (e.g. Joyce, Dostoyevski, James, Ibsen, etc.) leads us back to an individualistic conception of the history of literature; and 2.) even worse, one tends to overlook the overpersonalized form of alienation. Re- search is narrowed down to a highly intrinsic approach and inter- prets the subject as an accidental, independent phenomenon. In practice, the subject is reduced either to a psychological type- case1^ or to a symptomatic appearance. Both reductions create an indisputable mystification (biographical and situational determi- nation, as in the case of Homer "the blind seer" and Shakespeare's "genius").13 Although the mystification in Trivialliteratur seems to have af- fected the greater half of its production, and is therefore more in- tense, it is, curiously enough, limited to its surface, to the super- ficial aspects of the literary creation. The shift results from a logi- cal process. Whether the author uses pseudonyms (Michael Crich- ton, John Wyndham, Henry Kuttner, Pierre Barbet, etc.) or al- most reaches anonymity by the creation of a legendary hero (Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Perry Rhodan - even deliberate mythicizing occurs: e.g., Jerry Cornelius), his identity submits to something more important. The fame of the hero, the stereotyped attraction of the setting, the restricted basic patterns of conflict supersede any other object of mystification. Some examples: E.E. Doc Smith's Skylark series, the Mars and Venus series of Edgar R. Burroughs, the post-atomic war setting, the whims of a time-machine, robots and androids.14 The elimination of the immediate reference to actual reality looks for compensation in the adaptation of the liter- ary work to formal fashions (see Michael Moorcock, A Cure for Cancer; John Spencer, The Electronic Lullaby Meat Market) and modernistic ingredients. These can take several forms: drug ex- periences (W. Burroughs, Nova Express) ; pornography (PJ. Farmer,</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERA TUR 9 The Image of the Beast); Eastern religions (R. Zelazny, Lord of Light); non-Aristotelian philosophy and logic (A.E. Van Vogt, The World ofNull-A); new mysticism (A.C. Clarke, 2001 - A Space Odyssey); and so on. Two important ideological conclusions may be drawn: 1.) the principled engagement of science fiction, even if hidden, refers ultimately to the basic expressions of a conscience collective; it refutes any theory of positivist origin whose axioms claim to be free of values and which some have tried to impose on science fiction: "Der eigentliche Grund fur die Affinitâten zwischen dem soziologischen Positivismus und der Science Fiction liegt darin dass beide - auf verschiedenen Ebenen - dieselbe, als wertfrei ausgegebene, technokratische Auffassung von der Gesellschaft vertreten. Die 'Wertfreiheit' bezeichnet dabei nichts anderes als den ausdriicklichen Verzicht auf einen humanen postulathaften Begriff von Gesellschaft";15 and 2.) reification takes place on the level of the texts, through their cliché-concentration; it is easier to see through such a superficial obstacle than to analyse any complex crystallization in a sociological, ideological and philo- sophical context. Four dangers can be avoided: incorrect analysis and mystification of the subject (see Solzhenitsin, Kawabata, et al); deviation from the object of study (see the historiographie school in literature); ambiguity and contradictory interpretations due to the reification of the author's psychology (see the role of fate in Racine's works); and biographical individualization and reduction (see Edgar Allan Poe). The absence, then, of a direct, referential context in Trivial- literatur is reinforced by the de-individualization, both factors that oppose the documentary trend in the recent developments of modern literature. Social realism, naturalism, the commentary novel, and all other forms of documentary literature may provide an interesting opinion on or interpretation of a particular type of society, but surely not an objective image. Such an attempt at faithful reproduction lacks nuance and historical perspective and, in consequence, relativity. Formal, ideological engagement often model the author's world vision. It is easier to avoid confusion about any concept of the group, and have a statistical (since quantitatively important), thematic (since simplified and intensi- fied), and ideological (since popularized and depersonalized) analy- sis of pulp literature. Pulp literature, largely traditional in form and description, conforms to a slow but dialectical evolution of society. The main difficulty in piercing the resistance on the sur- face level is, as I have mentioned, the mystification of the given society, i.e., the transformation of actual tendencies in a transcen- dental form. Fragmentary case-studies (H. Bausinger, R. Escarpit,</page><page sequence="7">10 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES J.D. Hart, W. Nutz, R. Hoggart, J.M.S. Tompkins, G. Waldmann, R. Williams, etc.) have given the first elements towards reconstruct- ing a fair image of popular culture. A quasi-archetypal cycle, popu- lar mythology, regularly emerges. The Gilgamesh epic, the Odyssey, the Eddas, the Nibelungenlied, the legends of Saint Patrick, far from being starting points, should be considered results of mythi- cizing; the Kalevala is merely a poor collection of a much richer (but oral) heroic mythology. The same integrational approach of a society in a popular form can be discovered in science fiction and, partly, in some other forms of Trivialliteratur. n I limit myself to literature in the broadest sense, especially to its regularly disparaged forms. It can't be a coincidence that mythi- cizing constitutes the main characteristic of popular art. Very often, critics reject this procedure as negative and anti-social: "Le mythe est un méta-langage qui nie ou minimise notre expérience existen- tielle des oppositions de la réalité."16 It is my conviction that this rejection testifies to a non-historical and discriminating view of literature. Indeed, the role of myth in popular literature splits up into many-sided functions, which can only be understood from a diachronical point of view. The roots of myth-creation can be found in the inferior status of the masses and the ambiguous position of the intellectual. The latter's material dependence upon the ruling classes (the "Maecenas-constant") opposes his distinct sympathy for, if not overt cooperation with, the lower or working classes. Lacking effective, pragmatic power of defense in a given set of social structures and conditions (e.g., the Regenten-rule in Holland's Golden Age), the oppressed and the marginal unite their desires and hopes in a series of fictitious qualities. The sum of these qualities is considered necessary to help power gravitate towards the neglected social groups. Since the complex of quali- ties, however, is viewed as belonging to a distant time, the social equilibrium is only theoretically restored, and exclusively on the imaginary level. The shift in time and universe explains the eventu- ality of personification, or rather an allegorizing of these complexes, thus creating an ideal soil for the generation of the hero. The hero's image consolidates according to a conscious prevention of reality- control. Both a projection in time, past or future (see Roland and Tupac Amaru), and a projection in space (the deification of Achilles presupposes a parallel universe or a different continuum) bring about the fundamental types of falsification: historical falsification and metaphysicizing. The increase of distance from the social reali- ty in which the imaginary hero is created is inversely proportional</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERA TUR 1 1 to the hero's degree of integration with the reacting social clas- ses. For example: Tupac Amaru's return may be expected sooner than could ever happen with Jesus Christ (millenaristic tradition), whose image has become more and more symbolic and abstract. Moreover, the hero's role is always connected with moralization and the formation of an ideal and, by that, with education and en- couragement. Mythicizing includes a didactic purpose. Consequent- ly, a broader interpretation of this ideal-structuring transcends the individualistic dimension by systematic abstraction or depersonali- zation of the characteristics mentioned above, and makes a syn- thetic writer apply that myth-formation to society itself. When the society is being interpreted either as abstract essence or as a moral-ethical order, as in Plato's The Republic, the Utopia is born. Although sublimation can occur in the form of the perfect crea- ture, by a reverse movement of anthropomorphism and concen- trational reification - as in several works of H.G. Wells (e.g., When the Sleeper Wakes) - de-heroicizing is nonetheless synonymous with substitution of the society as organon. The relation of the hero in a Utopia to the society is one of a structure-double, of a microcosm parallel to an identical macrocosm. His function may also be a purely mediating one, as narrator, as non-integrated ob- server (see Pérochon, Butler, Bellamy, and others). The imposi- tion of a hero with didactic intentions on a structural entity (so- ciety, for example) simply denotes the generating of a mythology on a larger level, on a more complex scale, exceeding the indi- vidual. The Utopia is the first convincing model of an essential projection into the future, inherent in every myth,17 if not in its ideal image, at least in the didactic directive for the recipient (in the case of Roland, for instance). As far as the reactionary, neutral or progressive image the work of art inspires us with is concerned, the interpretation of this neces- sarily futuristic creation alone decides. If, by all means, this pro- jection is felt as a loss for the human being when compared to his actual existence, logically the development of mankind is con- sidered as a successive decline. The movement regularly emerges in the Redemption religions, the philosophy of Swedenborg and Kierkegaard, the Naturalists, the Existentialists, etc. Another philosophical implication is thé prevalence of the idea on matter, or "pour l'homo religiosus, l'essentiel precede l'existence":18 mat- ter cannot help striving towards the recuperation of its perfect es- sence, itself an a-temporal value. That a static world-image results from these concepts is evident. The acceptance of these principles, and a conservative disposition towards such a fallacy which does not take into account the constituent splitting factors (inequality, hierarchy, meritocracy, oppression, ambition, competitive systems</page><page sequence="9">1 2 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES and the like), inevitably imply a reactionary attitude. On the other hand, the belief in progress towards an ideal, towards the integra- tion of mankind, towards "improvement," is clearly marked by the notion of progressiveness. The blueprint of this striving can create static images, nonetheless responding to a progressive future vision. There is also the recognition of the fear of the self, of the created vacuum, enhancing the responsibility of realizing the Utopia. That fear can be retraced as well in existentialist literature (e.g., F. Sagan) as in the anti-utopia (G. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four; J.G. Bal- lard, The Drought; E. Zamyatin, My; K. Vonnegut, Player Piano; A. Huxley, Brave New World, Ape and Essence; A. Bester, The Stars My Destiny, The Demolished Man; W.S. Burroughs, Nova Ex- press).™ It cannot surprise us that it is precisely the variants of the Utopia which link together the tellurian mythology, the metaphysical and the technocratic ones. They mediate between the three different society models and their interpretations. Oligarchy, feudalism, and bourgeois capitalism have called into existence their proper, un- natural mythology. The first system failed to free itself from its premise of inequality: Plato's conception still presupposes an oppo- sition between citizens and slaves, and proclaims it natural. The feudal system's reaction showed itself most ineffective and weak, certainly due to the identification of its intellectual class with the representatives of the institutionalized Church. Examples like Magis- ter Nivardus' Isengrimus, Piers Plowman, or Van den Vos Reynaerde are extremely rare, the absence of Utopias except for some late ex- ponents, poignant. Besides, it is significant that the Utopias actually denounce the end of the old mythology (remains of which sur- vive) and even more of the languishing social system (Plato, More, Huxley perhaps?). It might make us think that the technocratic mythology in science fiction will end sooner than the previous move- ments. The logical escalation in the evolution of society-forms could give us undeniable evidence: evolutionary accelerations cause faster transformation of mythologies. This movement will necessarily persist for as long as the old class oppositions fail to be eradicated, since the creation of a mythology qualifies the reaction of a col- lective universe against the privileges of the upper classes.20 Retracing this dialectic process in science fiction, one can claim with Michel Butor: "Mais pour atteindre à toute sa puissance, il faut qu'elle (= S.F.) subisse une révolution, il faut qu'elle réussisse à s'unifier. Elle doit devenir une oeuvre collective, comme la sci- ence qui est son indispensable base."21 Indeed, the futuristic emanation of the popular ideals is a col- lective response to the challenge of the power-apparatus. The initi- ative is still the state's. The power-structures, being in force in the</page><page sequence="10">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERA TUR 1 3 socio-economic relationship, are extended to the cultural field. In the last decade, science fiction has tried to turn the tables. A new option should be taken now, not to react anymore, but to "pre- act." I presume that the intensifying integrational, utopian-idealistic, and equality-minded option will slowly fuse reality and mythology.22 m Tentatives until now have proved surprisingly unsuccessful. One ought to know why people - rather a particular age-class, and main- ly the intellectuals and the lower bourgeoisie - read science fiction. In the absence of more scientific, sociological material (apart from Hirsch and Nagl,23 only unsystematic data on the specialized re- views can be found),24 I shall consider the problem speculatively. The mass-production of science-fiction proves its value mathe- matically as a collective response. Interpretations on the futuristic projection of a social, humanitarian ideal can't be traced as yet. The existence of an enormous range of parallel degradation-struc- tures or institutions which favor degradation theories evidently in- fluenced the common reading public and provoked an escapist re- flex. However, this reflex - and misinterpretations are numerous - does not necessarily represent a reactionary or conservative atti- tude. On the contrary, mythicizing results from the structural impo- tence of the people to realize their ideals. One example: the Indian mystification around Tupac Amaru after the Spanish invasion of the Inca Empire. The mythology is the sham weapon of the weak. Often, the mythology is the last freedom left to the human being who lives in an oppressive society. But the mythology is also a double-edged sword: it surely expresses the collective urge towards the ideal situation, but at the same time prevents, for a good deal,' practical action. The mythology, in its dynamics, stands for a stabili- zing factor. The inherent dialectic of the phenomena is shown again. From this point of view, Frank R. Scheck, though again intellectu- ally disparaging and lacking the slightest nuance, deduces a remark- ably but only partially accurate observation: "Die Science Fiction ist die Massenliteratur einer kleinbûrgerlichen 'Bewaltigung' der imperialistischen Gesellschaft. 'Bewaltigung', weil sie anders als Heimat-, Wildwest-, liebes- und Kriminalroman, die elementaren Gattungen des Trivialen nicht auf gedankliche Flucht in eine vor- oder nebenimperialistische, weitgehend realitàtsenkleidete Form sinnt, sondern solche Realitât, in ihrer technologischen Perspek- tive, zugibt; statt Ableugnung der Zivilisation der kapitalistisch industrialisiez en Gesellschaft - ihre Einklammerung."25 Confu- sion appears between intention, attitude and pragmatism, the de- mands of which he postulates for the attitude, a normative and</page><page sequence="11">14 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES unacceptable generalization already refuted in this article. His apodictic intervention, on the other hand, to render fantasy and science fiction synonymous, mak^s obvious his evident lack of denomination faculty and historical insight. Moreover, such a combination must be antithetical, insofar as the fantastic element represents the unique aim of the author (see Michael Moorcock, The History of the Runestaff; Philip K. Dick and Ray Nelson, The Ganymede Takeover; Jack Vance, The Eyes of the Overworld; etc.). It is not the SF-setting that saves a novel from classification under pure fantasy, a movement deriving from the anti-social, late- imperialistic Gothic novel. It reappeared via the Decadents, the Symbolists, Gogol and Hoffmann, in the early twentieth century (Rosny Ame, H. Ewers, J. Ray, H.P. Lovecraft, R. d'Exsteyl, C. Williams, etc.), and by no means contains a progrès ive-futuristic indication, a vital characteristic of science fiction. The fantastic novel26 is the product of man-degrading theories, in which the phenomenon of Evil, of wickedness, rather links up with medieval satanic literature. The only clues they all have in common with science fiction are their upper class marginality and their mythi- cizing. The conception of man as an imperfect shadow of an ideal essence vehemently opposes that of science fiction. In other words, the interpretation of their myth creation dif- fers entirely. And one should take into account that, in fact, one shouldn't speak about noetic, intrinsic mythology in the fantasy- movement. The presence of exclusively negative ideals (dehuman- ized "heroes," destruction, evil, etc.) and especially the absence of a collective future projection in an ideal model impede it. Fantasy is perverse resignation and is in coalition with the existing social system. Fantasy at its best can partly belong to science fiction in- sofar as its paradigm of characteristics forms part of the whole complex of the mythical therapy. The monster is not Franken- stein but Dracula, not Doctor Mabuse but Fu Manchu. Besides, we have left out the formal conditions (the indispens- able element of "science'' in SF, whatever that may be). On the other hand, I do not exclude fusions between fantasy and science fiction: see, e.g., the Swiftian visions and satirical fantasy in Stan- islaw Lem's The Star Diaries of Ion Tichy. To summarize the argument, then, we consider that science fiction, as mythology, results exclusively from a social deficiency, namely the impossibility of breaking through the existing power structures in a given society. Evidence of the central object, which assures power for the ruling classes, should appear from this liter- ature, more exactly from its themes. The third recognizable form in the creation of Western myths has clearly denounced, isolated,</page><page sequence="12">SCIENCE FICTION AS TRIVIALLITERATUR 15 and woven its thematic treatment around the real weapon of the upper classes: technology. In the given context, technology, fatal product of an anti-societal, functionalistic and mainly positive science, could only increase the applications and possibilities of a hierarchical division, and reinforce the structural relations in a modern society. A defective insight made science fiction - almost without exception - tangle object and subject and, worse, cause and effect. The fear of mechanization, "technologization," and of society being computerized (see, e.g., the discrepancy between technological and ethical progress in Ernest Pérochon, Les Hommes Frénétiques; see especially Leo P. Kelley, The Coins of Murph9 and Kurt Vonnegut, Player Piano) remains on the level of the medium, not on that of the agent. The fear of the machine as an independent entity substitutes a true but often not recognized fear of its manipulators, scientists with the intellect but without the ethical conviction of the homo futurus. A complete infra- structure underlies this basic attitude, the most dangerous rela- tion of which consists of a control of science by the leading financial-industrial class and, by that, automatically in a guided policy of science. 1.) This purely theoretical outline started from the assumption that, basically, statics doesn't exist. No empirical proofs, except for our reading experience, have been given; moreover, "da allés of fen daliegt, ist auch nichts zu erklâren."27 But we have to recog- nize "was daliegt." 2.) Statics doesn't exist, neither as an onto- logical category nor as a phenomenological item. 3.) Popular cul- ture is a dynamic strategy to restore the balance between oppres- sive society-structures (or structures felt as being oppressive) and a revolting majority of the members of this society. This strategy takes a largely unconscious form: mythology. Trivialliteratur is a transparent result of the response of the body of society to the given society-structures. 4.) Three periods of myth-formation domi- nate Western history: the tellurian period, the metaphysical period, and the technocratic period. 5.) Trivialliteratur, and because of its wide thematic range especially science fiction, clearly incarnates the technocratic mythology. 6.) Science fiction lacks abstraction. Mythicizing shows for the first time a tendency towards objecti- vation and object -veneration, instead of towards a humanistic ideal. Channel or method, and motivation are wrongly mixed up.

NOTES 1 ."Wir dùrfcn kcincrlci Théorie aufstellen. Es darf nichts hypothetisches in unsem Betrachtungen sein. Aile Erklarung muss fort, und nur Beschreibung an ihre Stelle treten" (L. Wittgenstein, Philosophise he Untersuchungen, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frank- furt, 1971, p. 66). We ourselves do not exclude inductive hypotheses. See also A. Kenny, Wittgenstein, Het Spectrum, Utrecht/Antwerpen, 1974, esp. pp. 223-24. 2. Only very recently influential critical movements like Genetic Structuralism (L. Goldmann, H. Lefèbvre) and the Materialistic Theory of Literature (W. Benjamin, B. Brecht, T.W. Adomo, G. Lukàcs) have tried to outbalance the leading text -bound or biobibbographically interested critics (Close Reading Method, German Geistes- geschichte, Tel Quel-Movement, even Russian Formalism) or non-integrational, endo- centric theories like Phenomenology (R. Ingarden), "Introverti sm" (S. Sontag) and Logico-Positivism (L. Wittgenstein, R. Wollheim). For a critical outline, see V. Zmegac' and Z. Skreb, Zur Kritik literaturwissenschaft Ucher Méthodologie, Athenàum Verlag, Frankfurt/Main, 1973. 3. Subjectivism can also take other forms: see, e.g., M. Coulson and C. Riddells criticism on functionalistic theories for introducing hypothetic pre-suppositions in history (Approaching Sociology, a Critical Introduction, Routledge and Kegan, Lon- don, 1970); see also R. Dahrendorf, "Out of Utopia" in L. Coser and B. Rosenberg, Sociological Theory, Collier-Macmillan, London, 1964. But even recent materialistic analysis (esp. in the DDR) is falsified, having imputed social relevance as a function of the literary work of art as a didactic pre-conditioning. 4. One should avoid, nonetheless, the danger of reification; "the mass,** "the people,** "the bourgeoisie,'* etc. are projected generalizations, not object-like ab- stractions. Only a dynamic interpretation of too-often idealized notions can really relativate the normative superficiality of traditional analysis. Or, as R. Williams postulates: "To rid oneself of the illusion of the objective existence of *the masses*, and to move towards a more actual and more active conception of human beings and relationships, is in fact to realize a new freedom. Where this can be experienced, the whole substance of one's thinking is transformed** (Culture and Society 1 780- 1950, Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1971, p. 321). Proportionally, reification intensifies when objectivity - a relative notion in itself - is less realized. It might even be better to replace objectivity by "structuring:** "L'objectivité' n'existe pas, il n'y a toujours que la structuration de l'objet par le sujet" (L. Goldmann, Lukacs et Heidegger, Dcnoel-Gonthier, Paris, 1973, p. 95). 5. Goldmann relates this term ("l'extrapolation conceptuelle jusqu'à l'extrême coherence des tendances réelles, affectives, intellectuelles et même motrices des membres d'un groupe," Le Dieu Caché, Gallimard, Paris, 1955, p. 349) to great au- thors, embedding the collective conscience of a group, say, a nation, in a minimal group of representatives. Apart from methodological and denotative criticism (see, e.g., S. Doubrovsky, R. Barthes, and especially C. Bouazis, Littérarité et Société, Marne, Tours, 1972, pp. 177-21 1 ), it seems to me that conceptual concentration not necessarily justifies a quantitative sociological reduction, which easily gives way to reification of the authors themselves, rather than of movements, phenomena or contents. 6.

The intcgrational function of art in primitive societies, the dedramatization in film and theatre (e.g., R. Bresson, or B. Brecht 's epic theatre), the destructive force of the total, instantaneous, internally and externally photographic novel (W. Burroughs) all denounce the Marxist presumption on any artistic, revolutionary theories, reducing them to purely traditional and time-bound imitations or syntheses. 8.Structuralization, usin^ "structure" in the sense M. Serres attributes it in his definition: "Un ensemble opérationnel à significations indéfinies, groupant des élé- ments en nombre quelconque, dont on ne spécifie pas la nature, mais dont on a spécifié la fonction et certains résultats quant aux éléments'* (Revue Internationale de Philoso- phie, 4, décembre 1967, p. 449). In this article, no developments of conceptual defi- nitions will be tackled; we'll stick to a formal, descriptive analysis. 9. With "ideological infrastructure," I mean "the whole of structured, ethically founded, relative-partial belief-disbelief systems of social groups, containing x = in- definite but limited elements, the relations between whom are dynamic." Of great help have been H. van den Enden, "Het Begrip 'Idéologie'," Studia Philosophica Gandensia, 4, 1966, pp. 103-55, and H. Schnabelbach, "Was ist Ideologic? Versuch einer Begriffserklarung," Das Argument, X, 50 (Sonderband), Juli 1969, pp. 71-92. 10. A double danger of static interpretation may result from T.W. Adorno s state- ment: "Der realen Gesellschaft wird der Unterschied des Statischen und Dynamischen, sei es vom klassifikatorischen Bediirfnis, sei es von einer latcnten Philosophie, impu- tiert" ("Ueber Statik und Dynamik als soziologische Kategorien," Neue Deutsche Hefte, 81, May-June 1961, p. 49). 1 1. Always taking into account the relativity of the formal expressions themselves and the dynamic development of the human being and his group-formation. 12. See, e.g., B. Eizykman, Science-Fiction et Capitalisme, Marne, Tours, 1974, pp. 31-41, denoting H.P. Lovecraft's fantastic creatures as typical Judaic characters; see, on the other hand, the Marxist preference for the identification of Balzac with his commercial and bourgeois background (Lukàcs), or Mishima's reincarnation of the Japanese Samurai code. 13. In Marxism, this reduction is due to the incomplete application of Marx s personal views on art: "Des trois orientations de la pensée de Marx, une seule a été véritablement retenue par ses disciples: la vision déterministe de l'art, et l'interprétation de l'oeuvre à partir du modèle infrastructure-superstructure" (A. Reszler, "Bakounine, Marx et l'Héritage Esthétique du Socialisme," Esprit, XLII, 438, septembre 1974, p. 232). Determinism, based upon the retrospective interpretative system that should be described in a collectivistic and critical way, paradoxically includes the anti-mate- rialistic prevalence of the Idea; which Lukacs proves "malgré lui ... L'idée est tout, l'oeuvre s'effaçant devant l'idée" (p. 228). The same criticism of Idealism can be applied to the Positivists, especially to H. Taine, who even dangerously tends towards economico-racial deterministic concep- tions: "Mais la résistance (contre l'Espagne) ne fut pas la même dans le Midi que dans le Nord; c'est qu' au Midi le sang Germanique, la race indépendante et protestante n'était pas pure" (Philosophie de l'Art, Tome II, Hachette, Paris, 1906, p. 41 ).

Nagl, Science-Fiction in Deutschland, Tùbinger Vereinigung fur Volkskunde E.V., Tubingen Schloss, 1972, pp. 11-12. Nagl can also be criticized for his ideological narrow-mindedness, deliberately classifying all "progressive" forms of science fiction under the Utopia. Formally and elementary, neither N. Schachner (Beyond Infinity, 1937), S. Lem (Niezwyciezony, 1967), A Zagat (Exile of the Moon, 1931) nor B. Kellermann (Der Tunnel, 1913), to quote only a few examples, can be considered as Utopian writers. Intentional writing might be interpreted as another danger to objective analysis, being a methodological falsification and evaluation. To refute Nagl's method, see different conceptions: M. Pehlke and N. Lingfeld, Roboter und Gartenlaube; Idéologie und Unterhaltung in der S cienc e-Fict ion-Lit eratur. Carl Hanser Verlag, Miin- chen, 1970; M.

Every Utopia, however, including Marx's vision on the Communist period of com- plete equality, opposes paradoxically the dynamic foundations of its dia chronical de- velopment to the static image of a final, "eternal," conclusive pattern of (society-) structures. The projection performed raises a triangular problem: the axes of time, language and conception. Intrinsically related, their dynamic constitution might be put into question when dissociation is aimed at. Two hypotheses, propounded by Andre Jacob, try to refute^the static pétrification of the time-element: "Le temps originaire, qui correspondrait à une visée ontologique (static) risque d'etre, par principe, en deçà du langage, et ... on ne peut donc rien en dire" (irrelevance); andj "Le temçs originaire pourrait bien n'être que l'envers des structures temporelles spécifiées dans l'évolution et dans le champ de l'activité humaine" (antithetic dynamism, or dynamic inversion). (A. Jacob, Temps et Langage, Armand Colin, Paris, 1967, pp. 356-57). Utopian writers therefore risk to arrive at the same point where, e.g., Nazi-mythologies (see T.W. Adorno, op. cit., p. 49) had deliberately created immobility. Such an operation, how- ever, is all too transparent: "Croire trop vite à l'éternel, c'est sans doute réifier onto- theo logique ment, au lieu de réaliser humainement le futur, par un mouvement d'im- patience ou de crainte, en spatialisant à la source, plutôt qu'au terme, les trois dimen- sions du temps" (A. Jacob, op. cit., pp. 330-31 ). Our generative description differs also from Eliâde's views as to the notion of time. For him, the relation with actual society is irrelevant if not retrospective: he retraces all myths to a kind of sacred, archaic origin; myths stand for the react ualizat ion of sacred time, as opposed to linear, irreversible, "profane" time. In other words, "un mythe raconte des événements qui ont eu lieu in principio, c'est à dire 'aux commencements', dans un instant primordial et atemporel, dans un laps de temps sacré" (Mircea Eliade, Images et Symboles, NRF- Gallimard, Paris, 1952. p. 73. See also M. Eliade, Le Mythe de l'Eternel Retour, NRF- Gallimard, Paris, 1949 ). Being synonymous with an idealistic, superstructural negation of the diachfonical essence of each phenomenon, and excluding a dia- chronically retraceable interference with the existing social structures, this interpreta- tion should be rejected, because it finally leads to absolute isotopy, thus, to cyclic statics. 1 8.M. Eliade, Aspects du Mythe, NRF - Gallimard, Paris, 1 97 1 , p. 1 1 6. 19. The opinions of critics vary extremely on the position and value of the anti- utopia. M. Nagl and B. Eizykman oppose each other completely on ideological and psychoanalytical grounds. The danger of the anti-utopia, according to Eizykman, comes forth from its probable imitation of the psycho-libidinal patterns underlying the capitalistic system: "Au lieu d'essayer de se démarquer du capitalisme . . . par la re- cherche d'une collectivité animée car une configuration libidinale différente, l'Anti- Utopie marque son rejet de la Société en choisissant une donnéeprécise jugée fonda- mentale quant à la bonne marche du capitalisme, en l'exacerbant." Being "un exercice d'application impliquant l'intelligence approfondie du système actuel," the danger precisely consists in imitating, by depicting and incorporating the principles of such a society into its own basic patterns: "Péril évident si une critique non contaminée du système exige la description de ses méchanismes en contention libidinale du point de vue multiple de la fluidification des flux" (B. Eizykman, op. cit., pp. 99-100). Eizykman's concept ion al mistake, however, is twofold: the influence exerted is one- directional (passive, because analytical and descriptive), but worse, he considers the actual system as a monolithic block which is necessarily predominant. The capitalistic system, on the contrary, has become intrinsically paradoxical, having developed a fundamental antagonism between its aim and its praxis (see the study of inflation, on philosophical grounds, by R. Boehm, Kritik der Grundlage des Zeitalters, M. Nijhoff, Amsterdam, 1974). Eizykman's contradictions (deterministic causality between prin- ciples and reproduction) are thus refuted.

It should be a mistake against the dialectical development of spiritual values (and their transformation from and into the material reality) to deny the new form of mystification science fiction incarnates. Rationalization may alter the formal characteristics, and even change the complexity of the object -public relation (interpretation), but does not interfere with the projection of a spontaneous, popular reflex on social structures into a schematic "world-vision." Therefore, one has to reject, in spite of her correct generative definitions, bold asser- tions like S. Sontag's in L'Oeuvre Parle, edn. du Seuil, Paris, 1968: "En raison du progrès de l'observation scientifique, une conception plus réaliste de l'univers a triomphé de la croyance en la valeur et l'efficacité des anciens mythes. Passée la période mythique . . ." (p. 12). 22. Apart from the opaqueness of actual myth-formation (no time-distance), this seems to me the main reason for the decrease of mythology, and not only the comple- mentary myth-rationality, as G. Sebba brings into focus in "Symbol and Myth in Mod- ern Rationalistic Societies" in T.J. Altizer a.o., Truth, Myth and Symbol, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1962, pp. 141 -68; and who points out the danger of political mysti- fication: "Technology, to say nothing of other rational forces, lays down conditions which no modern society can evade. This means that the problems of myth and symbol arise under conditions imposed by the spirit of rationality. Moreover, under the rule of this spirit, myth and symbol become tools of rational socio-political engineering" (p. 168). 23. W. Hvrsch, American Science Fiction 1926-1950.
