<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN DRAMA AND THE ARISTOTELIAN TRADITION: THE FORMAL IMPERATIVES OF ABSURD TIME William V. Spanos There has always existed in the content and even the form of Western literature a tension between objective or conceptual time and subjective or human time, but until the latter part of the nineteenth century its source was largely unexamined. With the full-blown emergence of science as the defining perspective on human life, the problem of time became for the literary artist a fully conscious obsession. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say with Wyndham Lewis that consciousness of the distinction between the two kinds of time became the defining charac- teristic of the "modem" literary sensibility. As a result, it began to determine in a virtually absolute way not only the subject matter but also the form of the literature of our age. Modem literary form has its ultimate source, of course, in the disintegration of the Judaeo-Christian world picture under the assault of Renaissance science, of the "new Philosophy" that for John Donne "calls all in doubt." But the "purposeful" time order of science that replaced the sacramental or figural time order of medieval Christianity obscured for a long time the revolutionary formal imperatives implicit in the radical change in the temporal frame of reference.1 The post- Renaissance writer continued to compose: to imitate a teleological world-a world believed to be characterized by a beginning, middle, and end-even though science had discredited the eschatological mean- ing of "end" in favor of the idea of a human goal. But with the pervasive 1 Erich Auerbach, "Figura," Scenes from the Drama of European Literature: Six Essays, trans. Ralph Mannheim (New York, 1959), pp. 53-54.

CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE XII, 3</page><page sequence="2">implementation of science in the modern period, writers (and literary philosophers) began to see beyond the consoling or liberating "order" of scientific time into its significantly reductive implications for the drama-the motion-of human life and, by analogy, for the drama of the work of literature. What became powerfully, if only generally, clear to writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Mallarme, Proust, Yeats, Joyce, and Eliot, was that the statistically "purposeful" universe delineated by the scientific time perspective also produced the mechani- cal "well-made" literary work. The recognition of the analogous rela- tionship between the "time-shape" of the work of literature and the writer's metaphysics and ontology had even more significant conse- quences for later moders such as Sartre, Beckett, Ionesco, and Robbe- Grillet. They came to see that the literature of the Western tradition from Sophocles (or, rather, from Aristotle's version of Sophocles) through Dante and Racine, to Ibsen and his followers was the literary expression of the Western philosophic tradition from Aristotle and Plato through St. Thomas to the logical positivists-the tradition, that is, which recent philosophers of existence call essentialism. More specifi- cally, they came to see that the Aristotelian literary tradition, in positing the organic plot-the sequence of events that develops causally from a beginning which generates discords through a middle which amplifies discords into crisis to an end which resolves the discords-as "the first principle . . . and to speak figuratively, the soul of tragedy"2 is, in fact, merely appropriating the illusory teleological perspective of Western essentialist philosophy, which perceives and interprets human life from the end (in the senses both of termination and goal). Thus these late modems concluded that the Aristotelian "imitative" tradition, like the essentialist philosophic tradition, is a form of determinism that objecti- fies the individual (that is, transforms human consciousness into a fixed and understandable or measurable object) in order to make him feel at home in the terrible contingencies of real existence, which, in recent times, have been variously called "flux," "the absurd," "nothingness," or, perhaps most significantly of all, "die Unheimlich," the uncanny or, etymologically, the not-at-home. The philosophical criticism of the clock time of positivistic science -a criticism that had a considerable influence on the shaping of the 2 Aristotle, Poetics, VI, 1450a, trans. Leon Golden (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1968), p. 13. 346 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">new literature, first the novel and later, though in a different way, the drama-began with Henri Bergson, who observes that it was precisely the "notion of time as that enters into mechanics and physics" that prompted a revaluation of his philosophical ideas: "I saw, to my great astonishment, that scientific time does not endure . . . that positive science consists essentially in the elimination of duration. This was the point of departure for a series of reflections which brought me, by grad- ual steps, to reject almost all of what I had hitherto accepted. . .."3 And it culminates, of course, in such existentialist philosophers as Mar- tin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Jaspers, and Paul Tillich, whose diagnosis of the human condition is based on the recognition that human time-the active and thus threatening time of Dasein-is human exist- ence. According to Bergson, the phenomenal success of science was largely the result of its development of a system of temporal measure- ment based on the uniform motion of stable bodies in nature (the earth's rotation in relation to the fixed stars). Time, in this system, becomes an objective and neutral series of quantitative units independent of human experience, in which objects of investigation exist as discrete spatial counters whose behavior is forecast and measured by their uniform motion in relationship to each other. In thus perceiving time "spatially" -as units laid out separately in space as on the face of a clock-the logical or scientific intellect transforms a motion involving change into the kinetics of mechanism. By bringing a stability into the universe, it enables itself to measure, control, and exploit the objects of nature for the "benefit of man's state." As long as science deals with dead or, metaphorically, solid objects, no serious harm is done. But when the scientific intelligence turns from objects to human consciousness, as it has in the moder materialistic and utilitarian world, it causes a significant distortion of reality. For the human consciousness is the domain of, indeed, is identical with, quali- tative human time or, as Bergson calls it, duration (duree reelle), which, unlike the external world of objects, is characterized not by "simultaneity" but by process, not by an aggregate of discrete ideas (what Bergson calls "extensity") but by continuous and interpenetrating flow ("intensity"): "What is duration within us? A qualitative multi- plicity, with no likeness to number; an organic evolution which is yet 3 Letter to William James, quoted in Ralph Barton Perry, The Thought and Character of William James, II (Boston, 1955), 623; quoted in Hans Meyerhoff, Time in Literature (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1955), p. 10. MODERN DRAMA 1 347</page><page sequence="4">not an increasing quantity; a pure heterogeneity within which there are no distinct qualities. In a word, the moments of inner duration are not external to one another."4 Consciousness, therefore, is not amenable to scientific analysis (separation into discrete units) and measurement. Because qualitative reality is incommunicable, the scientific intelligence-that part of the mind geared to the purposes of action and communication in social life-attempts imperialistically, nevertheless, to transform the instabil- ity, the flow, of mental life, into separate and fixed spatial counters that, like objects, can be predicted and quantified. Thus Bergson says climac- tically in Time and Free Will: The main object of science is to forecast and measure: now we cannot fore- cast physical phenomena except on condition that we assume that they do not endure as we do; and, on the other hand, the only thing we are able to measure is space. Hence the breach here comes about of itself between qual- ity and quantity, between true duration and pure extensity. But when we turn to our conscious states, [our practical or utilitarian selves] have every- thing to gain by keeping up the illusion through which we make them share in the reciprocal externality of outer things, because this distinctness, and at the same time this solidification, enables us to give them fixed names in spite of their instability, and distinct ones in spite of their interpenetration. It enables us to objectify them, to throw them out into the current of social life.5 The effort of the scientific intelligence to transform intensive into exten- sive manifolds for the sake of social goals thus results in the "solidifica- tion" of consciousness and, by extension, of language, which becomes the utilitarian tool of the solidified man's function. In the more familiar terms of existential philosophy, man is transformed into object, the Thou 4 Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness, trans. F. L. Pogson (New York and London, 1910), p. 226. Bergson's "extensive" and "intensive" manifolds were first made known to the English literary scene by T. E. Hulme in various lectures and articles in A. R. Orage's The New Age deliv- ered and published between 1909 and 1913. See especially "Notes on Bergson I," The New Age, IX (Oct. 19, 1911), 587-588; "Notes on Bergson II," IX (Oct. 26, 1911), 610-611; "Bergsonism," X (Nov. 9, 1911), 46-47; "Notes on Bergson III," X (Nov. 23, 1911), 79-82; "Notes on Bergson IV," X (Nov. 30, 1911), 110-112. The most complete version of Hulme's exegesis of Bergson is to be found in "The Philosophy of Intensive Manifolds," Speculations: Essays on Humanism and the Philosophy of Art, ed. Herbert Read (New York, 1924), pp. 173-214. This essay, according to Mr. Read, was "pieced together" from "a series of four lectures on the Philosophy of Bergson, which were delivered in London during 1913" (p. xiii). 5 Time and Free Will, pp. 230-231. 348 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">into useful It. Freedom and the possibility of change, of becoming, are negated in favor of an absolute and static determinism. On the historical level, the scientific concept of Progress, which affirms the idea of linear motion towards an end, is, from Bergson's point of view, an illusion. For "Progress," under the aegis of scientic time, is achieved by the negation of radical change. Unique men, in this view, are conceived as solidified counters (puppets), whose unchanging or, to use Bergson's term, "simultaneous" motion is determined (manipu- lated) by and from a fixed "end." This end, as T. E. Hulme significantly puts it in his exegesis of Bergson, "could be known to an infinite intelli- gence" or predicted on the way by a careful observer of the uniformity among objects.6 As Bergson notes in his conclusion to Time and Free Will, "Hence, our life [under the aegis of scientific linear sequence] un- folds in space rather than in time; we live for the external world rather than for ourselves; we speak rather than think; we 'are acted' rather than 'act ourselves.' "7 Let me briefly summarize that part of Bergson's argument against science which, for our purposes, is most important: Positivistic or clock time conceives of the human being as if he were an inanimate object. Because it is geared to the life of social action, this kind of time demands the solidification of conscious states, thus transforming a potentially active and creative person into a passive function and his rich and vital intuition into a congealed language that can do no more than express his fixed social role. Historical time (action) is thus determined from the "end," and every particular moment or event in time, no matter how wayward, mysterious, or painful it may seem in immediate encounter, is capable of being understood and thus controlled or safely distanced by a scientific or, using a metaphor which the quotation from Hulme suggests (and to which I will return), a detective mentality that is especially attuned to the evidences of discursive language. When we turn from this image of the scientific macrocosm to the form of the well-made play, which, for convenience, I allow Alexandre Dumas fils to articu- late, we discover a parallel which, though it should not be, is startling in its point-by-point relationship: ... the most indispensable [endowment of the first-rate dramatist], the one that dominates and commands, is logic-which includes good sense and clearness. The truth may be absolute or relative, according to the impor- 6 "The Philosophy of Intensive Manifolds," Speculations, p. 203. 7 Time and Free Will, p. 231. MODERN DRAMA 1 349</page><page sequence="6">tance of the subject and the milieu. But the logic must be implacable from beginning to end; it must never lose sight of this end. While developing the idea and the action, the dramatist must unflaggingly place before the spec- tator that part of the being or thing for or against which he aims to draw a conclusion.8 The Bergsonian and, a little later, the closely related existential critique of the scientific world view focused the analogy between the well-made universe of science and the piece bien faite or, what to Ionesco, as we shall see, ultimately amounts to the same thing, the pre- conceived bourgeois literature of ideology. In the process, they also revealed to the modern literary imagination the continuity of the Aris- totelian metaphysical and literary tradition; that is, the unbroken line from Oedipus Tyrannos to the well-made play or, more exactly, from the Poetics, which asserts the primacy of plot on the analogy of the Aristotelian teleological universe, to the Dumas fils "Preface," which asserts the primacy of plot on the analogy of a rigidly determined positi- vistic universe. It was the revelation of this simultaneously metaphysical and literary continuity which, in turn, prompted in large part the modern reaction against the "Aristotelian" tradition. The point is made dramati- cally clear by Jean-Paul Sartre in his "anti-novel" La Nausee, which, along with Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground, to which he is deeply indebted,9 constitutes the most articulate and influential "anti-Aristo- telian" literary-metaphysical document in modem times. For it is pre- cisely the view of the author as manipulator of solidified men (puppets) in an essentialist time world that Sartre is attempting to demolish not only in the journal form of his novel but also through his "hero's" dis- covered philosophical distinction between l'aventure and la vie, which he articulates in the metaphor of the novelistic art: Ca, c'est vivre. Mais quand on raconte la vie, tout change; seulement c'est un changement que personne ne remarque: la preuve c'est qu'on parle d'histoires vraies. Comme s'il pouvait y avoir des histoires vraies; les evenements se produisent dans un sens et nous les racontons en sens inverse. 8 "Preface to A Prodigal Father," in European Theories of the Drama, ed. Barrett Clark (New York, 1947), p. 384. 9 Dostoevsky's anti-novel, like Sartre's, is grounded in a conscious awareness of the integral relationship between the well-made melodrama and the well-made "Crystal Palace" universe, which the underground man evokes by his recurrent satirical equation of "the sublime and the beautiful" and the "straightforward," positivistic bourgeois "gentleman." 350 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">On a l'air de debuter par le commencement: "C'etait par un beau soir de l'automne de 1922. J'etais clerc de notaire a Marommes." Et en realit6 c'est par la fin qu'on a commence. Elle est la, invisible et presente, c'est elle qui donne a ces quelques mots la pompe et la valeur d'un commencement. "Je me promenais, j'etais sorti du village sans m'en apercevoir, je pensais a mes ennuis d'argent." Cette phrase, prise simplement pour ce qu'elle est, veut dire que le type etait absorbe, morose, a cent lieues d'une aventure, pr6cisement dans ce genre d'humeur oiu on laisse passer les evenements sans les voir. Mais la fin est la, qui transforme tout. Pour nous, le type est deja le heros de l'histoire. Sa morosite, ses ennuis d'argent sont bien plus pr6cieux que les n6tres, ils sont tout dores par la lumiere des passions futures. Et le recit se poursuit a l'envers: les instants ont cesse de s'empiler au petit bonheur les uns sur les autres, ils sont happes par la fin de l'histoire qui les attire et chacun d'eux attire a son tour l'instant qui le precede: "II faisait nuit, la rue etait deserte." La phrase est jetee negligemment, elle a l'air superflue; mais nous ne nous y laissons pas prendre et nous la mettons de cote: c'est un renseignement dont nous comprendrons la valeur par la suite. Et nous avons le sentiment que le heros a vecu tous les details de cette nuit comme des annonciation, comme des promesses, ou meme qu'il vivait seulement ceux qui etaient des promesses, aveugle et sourd pour tout ce qui n'annongait pas l'aventure.10 10 Jean-Paul Sartre, La Nausee (Paris, 1938), pp. 62-63. "That's living. But everything changes when you tell about life; it's a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories. As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: 'It was a fine autumn evening in 1922. I was a notary's clerk in Marommes.' And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning. 'I was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles.' This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: 'It was night, the street was deserted.' The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure."

MODERN DRAMA | 351</page><page sequence="8">Time, that is, does not move towards some end that gives objects (in- cluding human beings) necessity, that is, the "right to exist" in the temporal continuum. It flows randomly, absurdly, and thus everything is superfluous (de trop) rather than "justified" as the Bouville merchants (les salauds) in their illusory melodramatic world believe. To tell about life (raconter la vie), according to Sartre, is to transform life into adven- ture. It is to see its "events" spatially and to narrate them teleologically, that is, to see them all at once (simultaneously) and to recount them from the vantage point of a foreknown end, in what Roland Barthes, no doubt borrowing from Sartre, has called "the preterite mode."" To put it in terms that will become crucial for absurdists like Ionesco, the transformation of life into adventure is, in fact, the transformation of the contingent into a "well-made" or "boulevard" world, in which all parts, despite their (in reality) unique, unstable, and problematic nature, fit like pieces in a puzzle-or clues in a detective story. Time as radical change is thus denied in bad faith. It is important, at this point, to make a distinction between the Bergsonian and existential criticism of scientific time. For Bergson, or more accurately, for his literary disciples, especially the interior mono- logue or "stream-of-consciousness" novelists such as Proust, Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, and, to a lesser extent, James Joyce, the obsessive effort of the bourgeois to congeal duree and to objectify human consciousness has its essential source in the positivistic principle of utility: the concept of man as "solid citizen." For the existentialists, on the other hand, especially the dramatists of the absurd, the middle-class obsession to solidify man has its source, to use Heidegger's phrase, in the effort to "flee in the face of death," which is to say, in the face of absurd time or Nothingness.'2 These motives are ultimately related, of course, but they do point to a significant, if as yet undisclosed, distinc- tion in the artistic strategies developed by the modern literary imagina- tion to counter the well-made form of the positivistic mind. It is a distinction, I think, that, more satisfactorily than heretofore, describes the spectrum of the new or, rather, the modernist sensibility. Bergson, it is true, does not insist on the radical distinction between the extensive world of space-the world that obeys the chronometric 1 Writing Degree Zero, trans.

Never- theless, his emphasis on the quality of duration as opposed to the quanti- fiability of spatial objects suggests a qualitative dualism in which the latter, because it is the realm of dead objects, is inferior to the former: Bergsonian " 'Duration,' " Wyndham Lewis observes, "is inside us, not outside. There is nothing but 'mathematical Time' outside us."'3 This tendency to polarize the subjective and objective worlds-and to favor the subjective-is emphasized by Bergson's conception of the uncondi- tioned or involuntary memory, which constitutes an attempt to resolve the problem of identity posed by Hume's empirical analysis of the self. Hume, we recall, asserts that the "identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one." He describes the self, rather, as "nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions" that cannot, except by arbitrary imposition, be conceived as a continuity: "'Tis evi- dent, that the identity, which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not able to run the several diferent perceptions into one, and make them lose their characters of distinction and difference, which are essential to them."'4 To counter this argument about the discontinuity of the self, Bergson posits the conception of "an enduring psychical life": Discontinuous though [the innumerable incidents in the psychic life] appear ... in point of fact they stand out against the continuity of a background on which they are designed, and to which they owe the intervals that sepa- rate them; they are the beats of the drum which break forth here and there in the symphony. Our attention fixes on them because they interest it more, but each of them is borne by the fluid mass of our whole psychical existence. Each is only the best illuminated point of a moving zone which comprises all that we feel or think or will-all, in short, that we are at any given moment. It is this entire zone which in reality makes up our state. Now, states thus defined cannot be regarded as distinct elements. They continue each other in an endless flow.15 Further, this enduring self is capable of being discovered retrospectively at any particular moment in the present by the memory or what Meyer- 13 Wyndham Lewis, Time and Western Man (Boston, 1957), p. 422. 14 David Hume, A Treatise on Human Nature, The Philosophical Works, vol. I, book I, part IV, sec. VI (London, 1886), pp. 540, 534, 540; my italics. 15 Henri Bergson, Creative Evolution, trans. Arthur Mitchell (New York, 1944), p. 5. MODERN DRAMA 1 353</page><page sequence="10">hoff aptly refers to as "creative recall."'6 In such a moment the entire past emerges as an enduring and continuing reality to become co-present with it. It is this creative recollection in tranquillity, this simultaneous perception of time from the vantage point of the present or "end," as it were, that constitutes the identity of the self. Thus Bergson's emphasis on the achievement of subjective identity, the continuity of the past and the present in the perceiving consciousness, is important-and ironic. Despite the interpenetration, the dynamic flow, the activity of the un- conditioned memory (or creative imagination) suggests, especially when applied to the literary act, the creation of a subjective space that not only negates scientific time or causal linear sequence, but also, like the scientific spatialization Bergsonians abhor, albeit in a more integral way, tends to neutralize authentic temporal motion and the agonizing dread of change. Despite the ambiguities of Bergsonian subjectivism, this tendency, as Joseph Frank has shown in his important (if often misleading) essay, "Spatial Form in Modem Literature," was crystallized by writers who, like Marcel Proust, came under the direct influence of the philosopher, into the anti-bourgeois quest for the utterly "useless," that is, "eternal moment," the transcendent moment in which all times of the perceiving consciousness are seen simultaneously, which is to say, teleologically. And this "spatialization" of time became one of the defining character- istics of early modernism. Thus in Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu, which stands, for Frank, as one of the paradigms of modem literature, "moments seem so overwhelmingly valuable that Proust calls them 'celestial.' ,17 Since the imagination is ordinarily dependent on the past, the material it has to work with thus lacks sensuous immediacy. In the "celestial" moment, however, "the physical sensations of the past came flooding back to fuse with the present; and Proust believed that in these moments he grasped a reality 'real without being of the present moment.' Only in these moments did he attain his most cherished ambi- tion-'to seize, isolate, immobilize' for the duration of a 'lightning flash' what otherwise he could not apprehend, 'namely: a fragment of time in its pure state.' For a person experiencing this moment, Proust adds, the 16 Time in Literature, p. 48. Though Meyerhoff does not draw the evaluative conclusions I do, his analysis of the involuntary memory is fundamentally similar to mine. His subject is Proust, but he makes it quite clear that what he says about the Proustian memory applies equally to the Bergsonian memory. 17 Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," The Widening Gyre: Crisis and Mastery in Modern Literature (New Brunswick, N.J., 1963), pp. 20-21. 354 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">word 'death' no longer has meaning. 'Situated outside the scope of time, what could he fear from the future?' "18 Further, it was this quest for the eternal moment of simultaneous perception that lay behind the "Bergsonian" disintegration of the causal or linear narrative syntax of the "Aristotelian" plot in favor of the spatially apprehensible "logic of images," as Bergson puts it. As Frank, following Ramon Fernandez, observes, the fragment of time in its pure state that Proust seizes, isolates, and immobilizes by transcending time in simultaneity is not "time at all-it is perception in a moment of time, that is to say, space. And, by the discontinuous presentation of character Proust forces the reader to juxtapose disparate images spatially, in a moment of time, so that the experience of time's passage is communi- cated directly to his sensibility."'9 Heavily indebted to Wilhelm Wor- ringer and his English interpreter, T. E. Hulme, Frank attributes the Proustian strategy of spatial form to the modem literary imagination at large. Like Worringer and Hulme, he assumes that all art falls into two formal categories, the empathic organic, which has its source in a humanistic confidence that the temporal world is meaningful, and the abstract "life-denying" inorganic, which has its source in whatWorringer calls "the immense spiritual dread of space," a space including, of course, 18 "Spatial Form," p. 21. All Frank's quotations from Proust derive from The Past Recaptured of Remembrance of Things Past, vol. II, trans. Frederick A. Blossom (New York, 1932), pp. 991-996. Two further extracts from Proust should indicate his debt to and spatial interpretation of Bergson's duree. "But let a sound already heard or an odor caught in bygone years be sensed anew, simul- taneously in the present and the past, real without being of the present moment, ideal but not abstract, and immediately the permanent essence of things, usually concealed, is set free and our true self, which had long seemed dead but was not dead in other ways, awakes, takes on fresh life as it receives the celestial nourish- ment brought to it" (p. 996). "In truth, the person within me who was at that moment enjoying this impression enjoyed in it the qualities it possessed which were common to both an earlier day and the present moment, qualities which were independent of all considerations of time; and this person came into play only when, by this process of identifying the past with the present, he could find himself in the only environment in which he could live and enjoy the essence of things, that is to say, entirely outside of time" (p. 995). It is quite obvious from these crucial passages that Proust is associating Bergsonian duration and the achievement of subjective continuity, i.e., identity, as a way of escaping not only from clock time but the destructive hammers of the time of this world. 19 "Spatial Form," p. 24; my italics. See also Ramon Fernandez, Messages (New York, 1927), p. 210. MODERN DRAMA 1 355</page><page sequence="12">"the flux of happening."20 Thus he interprets the tendency of the "neo- classical"21 humanistic literature of the post-Renaissance West to con- ceive plot in causally linear terms as a process in which literature becomes the tool of a scientific and positivistic culture dedicated to the achieve- ment of a materialistic Utopia. He thus sees the anti-naturalistic or anti- anthropomorphic literature of the Bergsonians, the French symbolistes, and the imagists as a radical reaction to this tendency, a reaction, that is, which rejects the causal linear time world of science in favor of the eternal moment of simultaneous perception.22 When we turn to the existential criticism of the modem bourgeois obsession to solidify our "conscious states" and to congeal our language, we discover that its intention to subvert the linear sequence of narrative logic is similar to the Bergsonian critique of positivism. But we also discover that the existential strategy of "decomposition," to use Serge Doubrovsky's term,3 is quite different in the effect it tries to achieve. Bergson and his literary disciples, whose work formalizes the simul- taneous moment, locate the ultimate source of the middle-class urge to solidify duration, the temporal flow of consciousness, in the positivistic criterion of utility. For the existentialists, on the other hand, this urge has its source primarily in the middle-class dread of Nothingness (though these are not mutually exclusive), which means, above all, the radical irrationality or absurdity of existence, of the universe as space-time phenomenon. Man, according to Heidegger, whose ontology, along with Sartre's, is the model of absurdist literature, is thrown (Geworfen) into a universe which is moving temporally towards no end and thus is capable of justifying no thing, to say nothing about human life. Man (Dasein: being there) is thus on a boundary, as it were, an alien, a stranger, in the world. All things in space and, especially, all events in time are ultimately foreign in their radical lack of definition, and thus appear to him in the guise of ominous menace and threat. This, as in 20Wilhelm Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy: A Contribution to the Psychology of Style, trans. Michael Bullock (New York, 1953), p. 15; see also pp. 37 ff. See T. E. Hulme, "Modern Art and Its Philosophy," Speculations, p. 86. 21 This term is Worringer's and refers to the empathic humanistic art of the Renaissance that has its source in the "classical" period of Greek style. It is thus to be distinguished from the term "classical" as it is used by Hulme and Eliot. 22 "Spatial Form," pp. 20-21.

It is, in other words, the realm of Nothingness. Thus the primordial response to the human predicament is, in the famous though often misunderstood term that Heidegger borrows from Kierkegaard, Angst: the dread or anxiety that has the meaningless or absurd motion of time, that is, no thing as its object. Echoing Kierke- gaard's definition in The Concept of Dread ("Nothing begets anxiety"), Heidegger writes: "That in the face of which one is anxious is completely indefinite."25 And again: "That in the face of which one has anxiety is characterized by the fact that what threatens is nowhere. Anxiety 'does not know' what that in the face of which it is anxious is.... [That] which threatens cannot bring itself close from a definite direction within what is close by; it is already 'there,' and yet nowhere; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles one's breath, and yet it is nowhere."26 After this, it becomes easy for Heidegger to equate the dread of nothing with human life in the absurd world or, more specifically, with "Being-in-the-world": "That in the face of which anxiety is anxious is nothing ready-to-hand within-the-world." But this "nothing" "is grounded in the most primor- dial 'something'-in the world. Ontologically, however, the world be- longs essentially to Dasein's Being as Being-in-the-world. So if the 'nothing'-that is, the world as such-exhibits itself as that in the face of which one has anxiety, this means that Being-in-the-world itself is that in the face of which anxiety is anxious."27 Since the predicament in the precincts of the not-at-home is intoler- able, men obsessively seek in bad faith to "objectify" (find objects for) dread. They seek, that is, to transform Angst or dread into fear, which has its source, not in nothing, but in something, that which is "ready-to- hand" (Zuhandene). Unlike dread, therefore, "that in the face of which 24 Heidegger, Being and Time, p. 234. The best phenomenological description of this process of "unnaming" that ends in the discovery of the terrible Unheimlich is, of course, the section in Sartre's La Nausee culminating in the anti-Adamic park scene, where the "garden" has become the viscous realm of absurd existence. 25 Being and Time, p. 231. 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid., pp. 231-232. MODERN DRAMA 1 357</page><page sequence="14">we fear is a detrimental entity within-the-world which comes from some definite region that is close by and is bringing itself close, and yet might stay away."28 This transformation of dread into fear renders Being-in- the-world, that is, the threat of nothing or the absurd, "visible" and thus accessible. As Tillich puts it, "Fear, as opposed to anxiety [Angst], has a definite object... which can be faced, analyzed, attacked, endured."29 It can be said, then, that the transformation of dread into fear domesti- cates the not-at-home that generates dread. This distinction between dread and fear is at the heart of all existential philosophies, and, as we shall see, lies radically behind the absurdists' distinction between the "Aristotelian" and absurd dramatic forms and the antithetical effects they produce. For Heidegger and other existentialists, this self-deceptive anthro- pomorphic act is the equivalent of the Fall (Verfall), since in domesti- cating the not-at-home, "Dasein turns away from itself." In other words, the cost of achieving the familiar " 'at-home' of 'publicness' " by objecti- fying or solidifying temporal flux or absurd time is the negation of individuality, which is to say, human freedom and the possibilities inhering in the future. For, despite its nightmarish character, the not-at- home is the essential condition for the activation of care (Sorge) and thus for the humanization of men. In taking "away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself ... in terms of the 'world' and the way things have been publicly interpreted," dread negates the possibility of evasion in the publicness of das Man (the collective and dehumanized "one" or "they") and "throws Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about-its authentic potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world."30 In other words, "anxiety individualizes Dasein for its own most [eigentlich] Being-in-the-world, which as something that understands, projects itself essentially upon possibilities."31 The parallel between Bergson's critical analysis of the application of scientific time to human consciousness and Heidegger's analysis of the fraudulent domestication of the absurd time of the not-at-home should be evident: Just as Bergson believes that the bourgeois society's commitment to social utility results in the solidification of man's un- stable, though unique and vital, "conscious states," so Heidegger be- lieves that its obsessive effort to escape from the dread of Nothingness 28Ibid., p. 230. 29 Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be (New Haven, 1952), p. 36. 30 Being and Time, p. 230. 31 Ibid., p. 232. 358 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">or absurdity ends in the objectification of the authentic self in the safe "at-home" of publicness, that is, in the crowd (das Man). But there is also a significant distinction in emphasis in Heidegger's phenomenologi- cal description of the concrete world. What he perceives over against the duration of human consciousness is not an external or spatial realm of dead objects in an inactive time medium that are totally determined by an "end." It is, rather, what the existentialists in general call an absurd world, a world characterized by change or, better, by sheer potential, in which time also is radically active. Thus authentic freedom, for Heidegger, as for most existentialists, is not, as it tends to be in Bergson or, at any rate, his literary followers, the condition that allows for the solipsistic pursuit of the eternal moment of simultaneous perception. It is, rather, the condition that insists minimally on the encounter with absurdity, or the courage to be in the face of Nothingness, and beyond, on the authentic, that is, personally responsible, renaming of the phe- nomenal world. Heidegger, probably with Bergson or, perhaps, his predecessor Descartes in mind, is explicit about this: "Anxiety indi- vidualizes Dasein and this discloses it as 'solus ipse.' But this existential 'solipsism' is so far from the displacement of putting an isolated subject- Thing into the innocuous emptiness of a worldless occurring, that in an extreme sense what it does is precisely to bring Dasein face to face with itself as Being-in-the-world."32 It is a "solipsism," in other words, which locates the field of human existence within the ambience of this world. Man's solitude and his individuality achieve meaning only in situation. Returning once more to the literature of modernism, we should now be able to see what is missing in Joseph Frank's account of the disintegration of the Aristotelian plot in our time. Frank, we recall, attributes the phenomenon of modernism solely to the anti-humanistic urge to spatialize time. For him, this urge manifests itself in works such as Mallarme's Un coup de des, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's Axil, and Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, that is, in the symboliste poem (no matter what the ostensible genre), the form of which is designed to be apprehended "intransitively" in "irenic contemplation."33 But in con- centrating too exclusively on the mode sanctioned by the New Criticism, he fails to differentiate another moder literary option: the urge to en- 32 Ibid., p. 233. 33 Eliseo Vivas, "A Definition of the Aesthetic Experience," Creation and Discovery: Essays in Criticism and Aesthetics (New York, 1955), p. 95, and The Artistic Transaction and Essays on Theory of Literature (Columbus, Ohio, 1963), p. 30. MODERN DRAMA 359</page><page sequence="16">gagement or dialogic encounter with the dreadful world of crisis or, as Eliot put it in The Waste Land, the "heap of broken images" left behind by the disintegration of the sacramental time order of the Judaeo- Christian era and, after that, of the "purposeful" temporal order of positivistic science. This is the equally anti-Aristotelian urge that mani- fests itself, not in the highly formal poem of the symboliste tradition, but in the "de-composed" narrative of the tradition beginning in the nineteenth century with Dostoevsky, Dickens, and Tolstoy; extending through such early twentieth-century writers as Chekhov, Strindberg, Pirandello, Kafka, and the Eliot of The Waste Land to the post-World War II existential writers Sartre, Camus, and Malraux; and culminating finally in the absurdists, who bring the artistic and ontological-meta- physical analogy into full focus. And as I intend to show, it is this existential urge to dialogic engagement with the absurd world rather than the solipsistic cultivation of duree that explains the new "anti- Aristotelianism" of the writers of the absurd, especially the dramatists, both their contempt for the tradition of the well-made literary work and their positive strategies of formal disintegration.34 It is also, I submit, what distinguishes the new from the old (symboliste) modernism. Like the Bergsonians, the dramatists of the absurd perceive the well-made "Aristotelian" play as a microcosm of the well-made universe. But like the existentialist philosophers, they conclude that the motive behind this "bourgeois" form lies not only in utility but also and pri- marily in the flight from the dread of Nothingness. They condemn the causal structure of the well-made play because, like the teleological universe or the positivistic universe of the clock-time mind, it deacti- vates time and transforms objects (including men) into predictable spatial counters. But predictability in the absurdist context means more than what is scientifically quantifiable and socially useful; it means, above all, the possibility of escaping the anxiety of absurd time by per- ceiving the end (in both senses of termination and goal) from the be- ginning or shortly thereafter. Like the "plot" of the essentialist macrocosm, therefore, the causal structure or, as I prefer to call it, the linear "time-shape" of the well- made "Aristotelian" play involves the protagonist (and, vicariously, the audience) in a search for and discovery in the external or environmental and/or internal or psychological past of the secret but rational cause 34 See my article, "The Spatialization of Time in Modern Literary Criticism," pp. 94-96. 360 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">of human suffering. This strategy, this fraudulent domestication of the threatening uncanniness of the not-at-home, renders the audience's experience of the world safe but inauthentic. That is, in objectifying temporal flux, in transforming the contingencies of real human experi- ence into a fiction that gives this experience a causal sequence "pro- gressing" linearly from a beginning through a middle to a preconceived end, the "Aristotelian" play aids and abets the all too human impulse of audiences to transform the dread of Nothingness or absurd time into, at best (as in Oedipus or Hedda Gabler), an endurable or cathartic- because understandable-fear or (as in Scribe, Dumas fils, Pinero, Galsworthy, and even Arthur Miller, to say nothing about the deliber- ately canned products of television and the cinema) into a perverse sensuality, a theme to which I will return. Thus the dramatists of the absurd invariably attack the plotted drama of the Aristotelian tradition (especially the so-called well-made problem play) on the grounds that it negates novelty and surprise, which is to say, the threat as well as the potentiality of the unfamiliar, by fixing it in relation to a foreknown end, to the resolved concords of a "plot." Thus Ionesco says: en effet, celle-ci imposant a l'oeuvre de n'etre que son illustration, l'oeuvre n'est plus creation en marche, action, surprise; elle est connue a l'avance. Des oeuvres realistes ou ideologiques ne peuvent plus que nous confirmer ou nous enferrer dans des positions preables trop fermement etablies. On cherche trop, dans les oeuvres, la defense et l'illustration, la demonstration de ce qui etait deja demontre, donc de ce qui n'etait plus a demontrer. L'horizon est bouche, c'est la prison ou le desert, plus d'evenements inattendus, donc plus de theatre.... Une oeuvre vivante est donc celle qui surprend tout d'abord son propre auteur, qui lui echappe, qui met l'auteur et les spectateurs en deroute, en quelque sorte, en contradiction avec eux- memes. Autrement, l'oeuvre creatrice serait inutile car pourquoi donner un message qui a deja e6te donne?35 35 Eugene Ionesco, Notes et contre-notes (Paris, 1962), p. 62. "Indeed, when a work of art is compelled simply to illustrate ideology, it is no longer a creative process, action and surprise; it is known in advance. Realistic or ideological works can do no more than confirm us in or nail us down to previous and too firmly established positions. Too often what is sought in works of literature is defense and illustration, a demonstration of what has already been and so need not again be demonstrated. This cramps the horizon, it is prison or desert, no more un- expected events, and so no more theatre. It therefore leads me to suggest that realism, for example, is false or unreal and that only the imaginary is true.

Thus, for example, in Ionesco's favorite play, Victimes du devoir, Chou- bert, echoing Ionesco himself, says at the "beginning" of the play in response to his petit bourgeois wife's complaint that "there's nothing new under the sun": Tu as raison. Oui, tu as raison. Toutes les pieces qui ont ete ecrites, depuis l'antiquite jusqu'a nos jours, n'ont jamais ete que policieres. Le th6etre n'a jamais ete que realiste et policier. Toute piece est une enquete menee a bonne fin. I1 y a une enigme, qui nous est revelee a la demiere scene. Quelquefois, avant. On cherche, on trouve. Autant tout reveler des debut. ... La police arrive, on fait une enquete, on decouvre la coupable. C'est du theatre policier. Du theatre naturaliste. Le theatre d'Antoine.36 Implicit in Choubert's insight about the ubiquity of the detective (or, what is the same thing, the psychoanalyst) in the theater of the West from Oedipus Tyrannos (to which Ionesco is not being quite fair) to the naturalistic "Free Theater" of Antoine is the idea of a dramatic world and the universe it reflects in which the motion of all objects is utterly predictable and, therefore, in which the mysterious crime (human suf- fering) is solvable, that is, capable of being rationally understood and and throws author and public into disarray, putting them in some way at variance with each other.

The one thing needful for the search, therefore, is the kind of intelligence for which a clue is a consistent or recurrent motion or pattern of a quantifiable and radically unchanging object that points to the end, which is to say, to the solution or "final cause" of the mystery that generates uncertainty and anguish. It is, in short, the rational intelligence of the positivistic scientist, which like that of his social counterpart, the detective, is implic- itly certain, despite the appearances of contingency, that everything in the universe-objects and events-are integral and quantifiable parts of a larger design, that is, play a significant role in a well-made cosmic drama. The detective, then, becomes for the absurdist Ionesco the absolute sym- bol of positivistic science. Ultimately, of course, this "policiere," because of the "total" vision which imposes simplistic patterns of order on the contingent, especially unique human beings, becomes the absolute sym- bol of middle-class totalitarianism. All this is made powerfully clear in the absurd irony of Victimes, which is a hilarious and savage satire not only on the well-made theatre du boulevard, as Ionesco contemptuously calls the bourgeois drama, but also, and significantly, on the materialistic determinism of Freudian psychoanalysis and, in the end, on the brutal "totalitarianism" of the bourgeois police state. After Choubert's equation of "Aristotelian" drama and the detective story thriller, an inflexibly empirical detec- tive-psychoanalyst invades his apartment (his at-home, as it were) to initiate a "drama" of detection in search of "Mallot, with a t at the end" -the secret rational cause of whatever it is that has disturbed the world. What he discovers in his detecting, which takes the form of a psycho- analytic effort to recover Choubert's (Everyman's) Oedipal past, is not, however, the rational cause that alleviates or distances anguish and suffering. At first, it is a disconcerting intimation of the "useless," un- stable, and wayward freedom of the human consciousness: 37 That Ionesco was aware of the precise ironic significance I am attributing to the juxtaposition of a "realism" that begins from the end and the "Theatre Libre," the name of Antoine's "revolutionary" theater, is made clear when, in calling for a truly free theater, he adds, "car le theatre d'Antoine etait le contraire d'un theatre libre."

The detective says to his victim: "Je vais t'en redonner des forces. Tu ne peux pas retrouver Mallot, tu as des trous dans la memoire. Nous allons boucher les trous de ta memoire!"39 And then, while futilely stuffing Choubert with bread, he concludes in answer to Nicolas' program for a new anti-Aristotelian theater: Je ne suis pas tout a fait d'accord avec vous . . .

As Richard Schechner observes in "The Inner and Outer Reality," Tulane Drama Review, VII (Spring 1963), "Insolite is one of Ionesco's favorite words.... An insolite world is one in which anything may happen, with- 364 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="21">Thus he draws into clear, if ironic, focus the analogy of the well-made detective play as microcosm of a scientific and bourgeois macrocosm in which "our states of consciousness" have been transformed into spatial counters that can act publicly without anxiety because all the gaps- the missing links-are fillable. For Ionesco, of course, they are the "vic- tims of duty," brutally "acted on" by the vested interests who are "certain" that the world is well-made and that contingency is merely appearance.41 The violence of the detective's effort to plug the gaps in Choubert's hopelessly recalcitrant memory, that is, to find an object for his (the detective's) dread, suggests another though closely related dimension of the absurdist revolt against the well-made Aristotelian tradition, one that also has its source in the existential criticism of science. In taking the scientific world view as their model (which they have been compelled to do in order to find metaphysical justification for their form), the modem "Aristotelians," according to the absurdists, inevitably establish and cater to an ultimately voyeuristic perspective that becomes, like positi- vistic science, a form of sadism. For, to adapt from Sartre's analysis of the I and the Other (which may be the source of Ionesco's Victimes and La Leeon), the "discovery" of sources of dread (objects for Nothing- ness) in the packaged endings of modem "Aristotelian" drama trans- forms the perilous I-Thou dialogue into an I-It or master-slave polarity that not only distances dread but also permits the I (dramatist and spectator) to take pleasure in the suffering of men (albeit stage illusions). out cause, at any time; it is a world of simultaneously hilarious and horrendous caprice. The insolite lurks in the most everyday experiences; it surprises us, some- times comically, sometimes tragically, sometimes in both ways at once" (p. 195). The insolite world, in other words, is Sartre's absurd existence or Heidegger's Unheimlich. The passage is translated: "I can't say I entirely agree with you ... though I've a high appreciation for your brilliant ideas . . . [To Choubert:] Eat! Swallow! Chew!

MODERN DRAMA 1 365</page><page sequence="22">Analogously, in perceiving the world as totally quantifiable, the posi- tivist neutralizes the threat of contingency and thus permits the investi- gator to take pleasure in (as well as profit from) the agonies of the violated earth without having to risk anything. It is, I think, this perverse kind of escapism activated and nourished by the well-made boulevard drama and the voyeuristic proscenium theater it insists upon-an escap- ism in which the fugitive flees from the precincts of pain yet remains to delight in the pain of others-that compelled the dramatists of the absurd to question the claims of the venerable Aristotelian tradition over the Western dramatic imagination. And finding that this voyeuristic escapism has its sources in the concordances of a too neat and tidy end, these dramatists thus undertook the systematic subversion of the suprem- acy of plot in the Western theater, a supremacy it has enjoyed with occa- sional exceptions (especially in Euripides, Shakespeare, the Jacobeans, Wycherley, and, more recently, Biichner) ever since Aristotle, borrow- ing from (and in the process somewhat distorting) Sophocles' "detec- tive" drama, claimed it as the most important of the "constitutive elements of tragedy."42 Seen in the light of its existential sources, then, the characteristic drama of the absurd, unlike the literature of Bergsonian symbolism, becomes a microcosmic image of an absurd universe. It has, as we have seen, much in common, especially in its implicit criticism of positivism, with the anti-Aristotelianism of the Bergsonians or, for that matter, of 42 See also my article, "'Wanna Go Home Baby?': Sweeney Agonistes as Drama of the Absurd," PMLA, 85 (January 1970), 20. Shakespeare's apparent disregard for endings, especially in the problem plays, the tragedies, and the late romances, has been interpreted for too long now from the point of view of the stereotyped and empty Aristotelian-Horatian time-space categories. His violation of the rules is thus invariably seen as the manifestation of a transcendent disdain of a super-dramatist for such pedestrian matters as conclusions. In one of the dark comedies significantly entitled All's Well that Ends Well, one of the characters says, "They say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear" (II, iii, 1-5). The startlingly Kierke- gaardian and Heideggerian thrust of this passage should suggest that it is high time that Shakespeare's "anti-Aristotelianism" be examined as a metaphysical and ontological as well as an artistic problem. It is quite possible, I suggest, that Shakespeare's characteristic refusal to draw the expected conclusions is a deliber- ate strategy to satirize his audience's obsessive insistence on an ending that "makes trifles of terrors" by finding a natural object or logical cause for the "causeless" and "unknown fear." 366 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="23">the surrealists, with which it is often associated. But it is, I think, ulti- mately-and crucially-different. For the anti-Aristotelianism of the drama of the absurd is not ideally (though it sometimes becomes in practice, when disintegration is pushed too far) the formal agency of a solipsism that captures or, as it is often put by symbolists and the New Critics, arrests duration in the eternal subjective moment that transcends time. The variously "de-composed" plot or "time-shape," the disconti- nuities of character (that is, "conscious states"), and the dislocated and often irrational language (imagery, syntax, and rhythm) of the drama of the absurd constitute, not a spatialized subjective world, but rather an inclusive figure of the external world described by the existentialists -the concrete world of the not-at-home, the existence which is prior to essence, where all things are superfluous and thus dreadful, yet replete with possibility. Inspired, like Ionesco, by St6phane Lupasco's anti- Aristotelian Logic and Contradiction, one of the scriptural texts of the absurdist College de 'Pataphysique,43 Nicolas tells the detective-psycho- analyst in Victimes du devoir that the modern boulevard theater is "not in harmony with the general drift of the other manifestations of the modem spirit," and goes on to propose a new dispensation: Nous abandonnerons le principe de l'identite et de l'unite des caracteres, au profit du mouvement, d'une psychologie dynamique . . .

Victimes du devoir, pp. 226-227. Doubrovsky also insists on the analogy between the Ionesco play and the absurd universe. "We must," he observes, "understand the very impulses, desires and nightmares which [Ionesco] projects on the stage as constituting his testimony on the present condition of man.... In case we wonder what evidence he intends to give, Madeleine is most explicit MODERN DRAMA | 367</page><page sequence="24">Like the universe he perceives, Ionesco's characteristic play de- velops, not teleologically, but from a beginning or, rather, from a beginning which is not a beginning: freely. "Quand j'ecris une piece," he reiterates again and again, "je n'ai aucune idee de ce qu'elle va etre. J'ai des idees apres."45 On the aesthetic level, therefore, the function of absurdist dramatic form like that of the romans nouveaux of Robbe- Grillet is to draw the positivistic detective impulse out into the open in order to thwart it, that is, to bring into focus the voyeuristic penchant of its audience of spectators (the penchant to transform dread into a manageable and thus comforting or even pleasurable fear) in order to frustrate it. And on the philosophical-moral level its function, to return once more to Heidegger's central metaphor, is to dis-lodge the individual from the tranquillizing familiarity of the solid, scientifically organized at-homeness of the crowd (das Man) and to drive him into the terrible precincts of the not-at-home, where, like Job, he must ask the humaniz- ing questions (die Seinfrage). Thus, in explaining the source of his anti-dramatic form, Ionesco observes: L'extra-social: c'est la ou l'homme est profondement seul. Devant la mort, par exemple. La, il n'y a plus de societe. Et aussi, lorsque, par exemple, je in Victims of Duty: 'There are always things. Since the modern world is in a state of decomposition, you can be a witness to decomposition.' If Ionesco's works appear at first so strange and disconcerting and seem so fond of the weird and the monstrous, it is not because they are immured within the universe of dream or delirium, but precisely because they open out into our world."

We'll get rid of the principle of identity and unity of character and let movement and dynamic psychology take its place ... We are not ourselves ... Personality doesn't exist.

We ought to ignore them completely, at least in their old form, which was too clumsy, too obvious ... too phoney, like anything that's too obvious ...

A ce moment, je le contemple, avec un melange d'angoisse et d'euphorie ... je regarde et je vois des images, des etres qui se meuvent, dans un temps sans temps, dans un espace sans espace, emettant des sons qui sont une sorte de langage que je ne comprends plus, que je n'enregistre plus. "Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela?" je me demande, "qu'est-ce que cela veut dire?" et de cet etat d'esprit que je sens &amp;tre le plus fondamentalement mien nait dans l'insolite, tantot un sentiment de la derision de tout, de comique, tant6t un sentiment dechirant, de 1'extreme 6ph6merite precarite, du monde, comme si tout cela etait et n'etait pas a la fois, entre l'etre et le non-etre: et c'est de la que proviennent mes farces tragiques... .46 This dislodgement or, in Ionesco's remarkably similar version of Heidegger's metaphor, this "depaysement," which is effected by the absurdist form, sets the stage for its positive function. In disengaging the individual from the security of the crowd, it reveals through the agency of dread, not only the Nothingness of his existence, but also the potentialities inhering in time and thus his radical freedom. When one fails to get by "cette premiere etape du depaysement (car on a bien l'impression de se reveiller dans un monde inconnu)," the not-at-home generates in him a feeling of vertiginous anguish. But according to Ionesco, "tout cela peut, tout aussi bien, devenir euphorique: l'angoisse se transforme soudain en liberte; plus rien n'a de l'importance en dehors 4 Ibid., pp. 114-115. For the precise meaning of the important Ionescan word "insolite," see footnote 40. "It is in its nonsocial aspect that man is pro- foundly alone. Faced with death, for example. Then society no longer counts. Or when, say, I awake to myself and the world, and suddenly gain or regain an awareness that I am, that I exist, that I am surrounded by something, all sorts of objects, a sort of world, and everything seems strange and incomprehensible to me.... At such a moment I gaze upon it with a mixture of anguish and euphoria; separate from the universe, as though placed a certain distance outside it; I look and I see pictures, creatures that move in a kind of timeless time and spaceless space, emitting sounds that are a kind of language I no longer under- stand or even register. 'What is all this?' I wonder. 'What does it all mean?' And out of this state of mind, which seems to spring from the most fundamental part of my nature, is strangely born at times a feeling that everything is comic and derisory, at others a feeling of despair that the world should be so utterly ephemeral and precarious, as if it all existed and did not exist at one and the same time, as if it lay somewhere between being and not being: and that is the origin of my tragic farces."

MODERN DRAMA 369</page><page sequence="26">de l'emerveillement d'etre, de la nouvelle, surprenante conscience de notre existence dans une lumiere d'aurore, dans la liberte retrouvee....47 Thus the ultimate purpose of the drama of the absurd is unlike that of both the drama of the Aristotelian tradition and of the anti-Aristo- telian literature of "Bergsonian" modernism. The function of Aristo- telian tragedy is to produce a purgation of anxiety (a reconciliation of the simultaneous motion toward of pity and motion away of terror) in the discovery of the logical justification of the unique part (that which causes anxiety) in the larger whole. Similarly, the literature deriving from Bergson (if not Bergson's philosophy itself) exists to minimize the bite of active time, though its strategy, the spatialization of time to achieve the transcendent moment of simultaneous perception, is subjec- tive rather than objective. On the other hand, the purpose of the drama of the absurd is to generate anxiety or malaise-and thus the interroga- tive mood that calls for decision-by denying justification. The anti-form of absurdist drama, that is, serves to dissolve and unfix again the solidi- fied and named "conscious states" of an audience that "shares the reciprocal externality of outer things" in the passive medium of scientific or clock time. In thus driving him out of the crowd into the solitude of the not-at-home, the absurd "time-shape" of the play makes it possible for the members of the audience to recover their authentic freedom and, thereby, a truer relationship with the problematic Other, which, of course, includes other human beings. "We live forward and understand backward," Kierkegaard has written somewhere. Both the drama of the Aristotelian tradition and the anti-Aristotelian literature of the Berg- sonian-symboliste tradition, each in its own way, idealize teleological time-shapes that orient audiences to "understand backward" at the expense of the possibilities of future time or freedom, which is to say, of human life. The absurdists, on the other hand, prefer time-shapes that, like Kierkegaard's and Sartre's existential emphasis on the future rather than the past, orient audiences to "live forward" even if it means 47 bid., p. 141. Ionesco's evocation of death as the Grenz-situation that dislodges the individual and reveals the not-at-home suggests that his immediate source is Heidegger's well-known analysis of death in Being and Time; see espe- cially pp. 296-311. The translation of Ionesco: "When you fail to go beyond this first stage of depaysement-for you really do have the impression you are waking to a world unknown-the sensation of evanescence gives you a feeling of anguish, a form of giddiness. But all this may equally well lead to euphoria: the anguish suddenly turns into release; nothing counts now except the wonder of being, that new and amazing consciousness of life in the glow of a fresh dawn, when we have found our freedom again." Notes and Counter Notes, p. 163. 370 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="27">the admission of radical contingency. The former intends to make ob- jects or angels of men. The latter conserves and gives dignity to their humanity. For absurdists like Ionesco (whose euphoric freedom, however, is too often like the weightless and gossamer randomness of Sartre's un- committed Orestes or Mathieu Delarue), Pinter, Genet, and Beckett, this new relationship with others is that of estrangement. As Ionesco puts the paradox, "c'est dans notre solitude fondamentale que nous nous retrouvons et que plus je suis seul, plus je suis en communion avec les autres, alors que dans l'organisation sociale, qui est organisation des fonctions, l'homme ne se reduit qu'a sa fonction alienante."48 For others, however, say Pirandello, the T. S. Eliot of Sweeney Agonistes, the Sartre of No Exit, the Frisch of The Firebugs, or the Diirrenmatt of The Visit, the revelation of freedom in the not-at-home of temporal flux generates an urgent need to choose responsibly (in full consciousness of the per- sonal need to answer to another), to rename one's relationship to the absurd Other in the dark light of the revelation of Nothingness.49 If, therefore, the defining characteristic of the form of absurdist drama is a time-shape that disengages the individual from the audience by breaking down his "detective" frame of reference and then orients him toward the absurd world, it becomes obvious that much anti-Aristotelian drama that is taken to be absurdist-Happenings or, for that matter, the drama of the Living Theater, for example-is not. Or, at any rate, it is not existential drama of the absurd. To be sure, the line between the subjective drama of the solipsistic imagination, or what I prefer to call, 48 Notes et contre-notes, p. 60. See also pp. 89-90, 92-93. ". .. It is in our fundamental solitude that we rediscover ourselves and that the more I am alone, the more I am in communion with others; whereas in organized society, which is an organization of functions, man is merely reduced to his function, which alien- ates him from the rest." Notes and Counter Notes, p. 78. 49 See Iris Murdoch, "The Sublime and the Beautiful Revisited," Yale Re- view, XLIX (1959), 247-271, for an eloquent defense of the contingent both in literature and the world against the Kantian, i.e., "spatial" or "teleological" form of the symboliste tradition in poetry and the novel. My main reservation about Miss Murdoch's argument has to do with her interpretation of Sartre's existential hero as the solipsistic and neurotic "Totalitarian Man," for whom there are no "real contingent separate other people," only a self that internalizes others and in the process transforms them into extensions of his consciousness. As such he becomes "a clear-cut piece of drama rather than an individual" (p. 255). This interpretation, I think, is based primarily on a reading of La Nausee which fails to recognize Sartre's ironic attitude towards Roquentin's final equation of the work of art with Platonic circles. MODERN DRAMA 1 371</page><page sequence="28">after Allen Tate and Jacques Maritain, the "angelic" imagination (the imagination that "tries to disintegrate or to circumvent the image [the moving image of temporal existence] in the illusory pursuit of es- sence"),50 is not easy to determine. Indeed, because of its inevitable uncertainty it is very easy to completely internalize what is even in- tended as a microcosm of an absurd external world, as, for example, Ionesco almost does in The Bald Soprano. It may very well be that the distinction I am suggesting has not emerged fully and clearly into the consciousness of some existentially oriented dramatists. This is suggested by Ionesco's insistence on the formalism of his drama in his attacks on the "ideological" theater of Sartre, Brecht, Miller, and others and by his repeated reference to its "oneirical" character. Nevertheless, there is, as I have tried to show, ample evidence to suggest that the formal distinction I have tried to define-the dis- tinction which has its ultimate source in the different emphases that Bergson and the existentialists give in their respective analyses to the tendency of the chronometric time of science to solidify "con- scious states," and to congeal man's language-is a real one. There is a pervasive feeling among contemporary writers-one even be- ginning to be shared by members of the academy-that the so-called "moder" period, the period of Yeats, Eliot, and Pound, is over, and that a "new sensibility" has emerged. On the other hand, there is little certainty about the nature of this new sensibility and the kind of literary work it produces. The distinction I have attempted to articulate between the positivist, the Bergsonian-symboliste, and the absurdist imaginations might, therefore, serve as a valid point of departure in the necessary business of mapping the bewildering terra incognita of the moder literary landscape.
