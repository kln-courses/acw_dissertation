<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biological Psychiatry: A Review of Recent Advances, by J. R. Smythies, A. Coppen and N. Kreitman. Heinemann, 1968. pp. 109. 30/-. This is a highly technical book, much of which is beyond the range of those without basic educa tion in biology. However, the initial chapter on genetic and psycho-social factors in schizophrenia is comprehensive to the non-biologist and presents a satisfying multifactorial model. " It would . . . seem to be unrewarding to enter into arguments as to whether the genetic or environmental factors are the more ' important '. No gene can act in the absence of an environment and every en vironment acts on a genetically limited organism ". The history and present state of genetic research are critically presented, together with the theoretical models of familial factors offered respectively by Bateson, Lidz and Wynne and Singer. In these models, the genetic factor would be seen as render ing schizophrenics " extremely sensitive to malignant or benign factors in their environment ". The final chapter is concerned with the theoretical basis of psycho-analysis. Freud's formulations and concepts are considered to have been admirably suited for the initial tasks of establishing a science: the gathering of raw data and its ordering into a coherent scheme. " How ever, the time is just beginning when stage three can be tackledâ€”the link-up between psycho analysis and the rest of behavioural science ". The authors follow Kardiner in discarding the concept of libido in favour of the " need for love " derived 45</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS from the infant's real dependency, and " not a by-product of instinctual energy (This is obscure. Natural selection might well have equipped the child with natural instinctual drives or mechanisms apt to preserve his dependent security, but the context suggests a theory of secondary drive.) In any case, the object of anxiety is the loss of dependent security, and the function of conscience is to preserve it. Castration fears are inessential, and neurosis arises from the conditioning of shame and guilt reactions to sexual and defaecatory activities. However, this criticism does not apply to psycho analysis as therapy, where standards are purely pragmatic. " The anthropomorphic and dualistic features " of Freud's model " might well render it valuable as a means of psychotherapy. The criteria of 'truth ' and ' falsity ' do not necessarily enter into our evaluation of systems of psychotherapy ". This is interesting. Is it better for social work students to learn the psychology which ranks higher in " the positivistic hierarchy of science ", or that which is pragmatically valuable for helping people? E. E.
