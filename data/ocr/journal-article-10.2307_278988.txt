<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GRAND CANYON FIGURINE COMPLEX ALAN R SCHROEDL A reexamination of all the published reports on split-twig figurine sites in light of the excavation of Cowboy Cave where 20 whole and fragmentary specimens were recovered under good stratigraphic control provides a foundation for discussing the possible cultural affiliation of the Grand Canyon figurine complex. A hypothesis is presented which may account for the known distribution of figurine finds and their lack of cultural associations at some sites.</page><page sequence="2">REPORTS 255 For most archaeologists, the individual arti- fact is no longer the center of attention; presently, the focus is on functional associa- tions, cultural processes, and analyses of cul- tural systems. Occasionally, however, there are single artifact types, such as the split-twig figurine, which have implications beyond the artifactual level and seem to offer new insights into functional relationships and cultural processes. This paper demonstrates that an understanding of the late Western Archaic in the greater Southwest is dependent, in part, on understanding the archaeological significance of split-twig figurines. Over 40 years ago in a small cave in Clear Creek Canyon in the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona, members of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) discovered three miniature animal figurines (Wheeler 1949). These figurines were ingeniously constructed of a single long thin willow branch, split down the middle, bent and folded in such a way as to create a miniature representation of an animal. In the intervening years numerous other whole and fragmentary split-twig figurines were recovered (see Table 1), but the mystery surrounding the stick figurines remained. In order to solve this mystery, the Grand Canyon Figurine Project was undertaken in the mid 1950s and was reported by Schwartz and others (1958). They reviewed their finds in conjunc- tion with the other then known split-twig figurines. They were able to describe in great detail the methods, techniques, and materials of construction, and on the basis of functional parallels, they inferred that these figurines were probably magico-religious objects that were used in ritual activities to insure success in hunting game animals. Two of the figurines they discovered in Tse- An-Kaetan were radiocarbon dated at 3100?100 and 3530?300 radiocarbon years, earlier than any known cultural complex in the area at that time. On the basis of these dates they proposed that the split-twig figurine was the core trait for a new complex, possibly Archaic, which they named the Grand Canyon figurine complex. Since no Archaic sites were known from the immediate area, no cultural affinities or associa- tions could be posited. Given the lack of any associated diagnostic artifacts, there was some skepticism that the figurines were actually that old. Since then, however, a total of six radiocarbon dates have been reported for split-twig figurines (see Table 1) including one specimen from Etna Cave that was collected in the mid 1930s (Fowler 1973a). These dates all range between 3100 and 4100 B.P., thus an age in the second millennium B.C. seems relatively secure. Since 1958 several more sites have been recorded and many more stick figurines col- lected (see Table 1). Additional information on construction and variation has also been report- ed. Reilly (1966) describes a figurine from Stantons Cave in which deer droppings were found within the body cavity of the figurine. Since the location of Stantons Cave precludes its use as a natural shelter for deer, Reilly believes that the droppings were carried into the cave by the makers of the figurines and inserted in them during construction. He also notes that elk, pronghorn antelope, and bighorn sheep have been suggested as the animals represented by the horned figurine specimens. Functionally, these artifacts are considered to have had some magical or religious signifi- cance concerning hunting practices (Smith 1963; Euler and Olson 1965; Olson 1966; Reilly 1969). The basis for this interpretation is that some figurines are found pierced with slender cottonwood twigs or "spears" which suggest a ritual "killing" of the animals they represent. Surprisingly though, probably no more than ten percent of all known figurines were found pierced, and of those, most were found in sites which are concentrated in a small area in the Grand Canyon. On the basis of the wide distribution of stemmed points noted by Lister (1953) throughout the Southwest, Euler and Olson (1965) postulated that the split-twig figurines were associated with the Pinto complex, but it was not until the mid 1 960s that the first Archaic sites were found in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon (McNutt and Euler 1966). Because of the proximity of these sites to the Grand Canyon, Euler (1966, 1967, 1974) believed that the stick figurines were associated with the Pinto complex. Smith (1963), on the basis of other artifacts, ascribed the Newberry Cave stick figurines from California to Amargosa Phase II. But in no case during this time were split-twig figurines found in indis- putable association with diagnostic artifacts. Until 1975 there was no concrete evidence</page><page sequence="3">256 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 1977] Table 1.

However, during the summer of 1975 the University of Utah excavated Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave, two dry Archaic cave sites on a tributary to Barrier Creek in southeastern Utah. At Cowboy Cave, 20 whole and fragmentary specimens of stick figurines were recovered from stratified deposits up to 2 meters thick, most under good archaeological control. A single figurine frag- ment was recovered from Walters Cave, a site adjacent to Cowboy Cave. The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the split-twig figurine sites in order to deter- mine the artifact assemblages associated with split-twig figurines and to discuss any known complexes with which this assemblage might be associated. Secondly, a hypothesis is presented which may account for the archaeological context in which figurines are found and the geographical distribution of known split-twig figurine sites. SPLIT-TWIG FIGURINE SITES More than 370 specimens of split-twig figurines are known (see Table 1), and many more are probably in the hands of private collectors and have never been reported (Jett 1968). These figurines have been collected from 16 different locations throughout the greater Southwest, seven of which are in Arizona, one is in California, two are in Nevada, and six are in Utah (see Fig. 1). Most of these locations are cave sites, and all, with the exception of Newberry Cave in California, are within the drainage of the Colorado River. Only three of these 16 sites, Etna Cave, Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave, have stratified deposits. Each of these sites is described below. The number preceding each site refers to its location on the map in Figure 1.

No figurines were found here by members of the Grand Canyon Figurine Project, but they did find on the surface within the cave a pendant drilled with two holes made of the locally available Coconino sandstone. (2) Stantons Cave (Wheeler 1949; Gunnerson 1955; Schwartz and others 1958; Euler and Olson 1965; Reilly 1966, 1969; Reeder 1967; Jett 1968; Euler n. d. ). This cave is on the north bank of the Colorado River in Marble Canyon in northern Arizona. It is probably the most famous and prodigious figurine site known; here, perhaps more than two hundred specimens have been collected, primarily by amateurs. In the thirty years that stick figurines have been collected at this site, no other associated artifacts have ever been recorded. (3) Tse-An-Sha (Farmer and de Saussure 1955; Schwartz and others 1958) This cave site is located on the south side of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. Three stick figurines were collected in 1954 when this site was first recorded by members of the Grand Canyon Figurine Project. No other artifacts were noted. (4) White Cave (Farmer and de Saussure 1955; Schwartz and others 1958) This site is a cave also located in the Grand Canyon on the south side of the Colorado River. Eight split-twig figurines were recovered at this site, but no other artifacts were associated with them. (5) Tse-An-Kaetan (Farmer and de Saussure 1955; Schwartz and others 1958) Twenty-three stick figurine specimens were recovered from this cave site in the Grand Canyon near Tse-An-Sha and White Cave. At this site, a number of artifacts were found including a hank of human hair wrapped with cotton(?) string, a possible torch, a wooden spatula-like object, a wooden awl, a vine- wrapped stick, a chert flake wrapped in bark, a hammerstone, one projectile point, and a small wooden "spear" found within a cache of figurines. (6) Sycamore Canyon (Kelly 1966) Over forty years ago, about 15 stick figurines were found in a cave in Sycamore Canyon near Clarkdale in central Arizona. The original collector claims to have found the figurines in a four and a half foot deep sand filled cist at one end of the cave. No other artifacts were found associated with them; however, aboriginal masonry structures were present in other parts of the cave. (7) Walnut Canyon (Olson 1966) This site is also a cave located in central Arizona. Eight whole and 23 fragmentary split-twig figurines, two of which were radio- carbon dated, were found at this site during its survey and excavation. Excavation of the 10 to 15 cm of deposits produced three large points or knives, four cores, a hammerstone, 38 flakes, half of a unifacially used handstone, an antler punch(?), four pieces of cordage, 55 yucca leaves (five retaining the sharp point), 33 knotted pieces of yucca, and 184 willow twigs (Salix sp.) which had been split. A later occupation was represented in the front part of the cave by 28 pottery sherds. (8) Newberry Cave (Smith and others 1957; Smith 1963) Five whole stick figurines and a number of fragments were recovered from this cave site in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, California. Four of the five whole specimens were found in a pack rat midden. The fifth specimen was found about 20 cm below the surface in Room Three. From this same room several painted stones and two quartz crystals painted with green pigment were recovered. Excavation in several of the other rooms revealed other artifacts including a handstone, sandals, a number of atlatl foreshafts, several projectile points, scrapers, pigments, and numerous other artifacts. Pictographs were also found in the vicinity of the site. Smith (1963) ascribed the figurines to Amargosa Phase II. (9) Moapa Valley (Schroeder 1953) A single stick figurine of tule was found in the early 1950s at a small shelter on the south side of Orphan Butte in Moapa Valley in Nevada. The only cultural associations noted at the site were a single abrading stone with</page><page sequence="6">REPORTS 259 straight narrow grooves and a unifacially worked scraper. (10) Etna Cave (Fowler 19 73b) Etna Cave, which is located in southeastern Nevada, was the first stratified site to yield split-twig figurines. Of the 12 specimens found there, Wheeler attributes five to a Basketmaker III occupation and four to his Gypsum Cave level; three were of undetermined provenience. This interpretation of the 1930s excavations is questionable, in part because modern horse dung was found in the lower levels. It is possible that Wheeler's assignments of cultural affiliation are in error, especially since Fowler (1973b:4) suggests that the deposits may have been more disturbed than Wheeler realized. Thus, the figurines Wheeler assigned to a Basketmaker III occupation, an occupation Fowler now designates as Fremont, may actual- ly belong to a late Archaic occupation. Adding to this confusion is the fact that on the Colorado Plateau certain "Archaic," "Basket- maker," and "Fremont" traits are found in contemporaneous contexts (Schroedl 1976). Assuming that all the figurines from Etna Cave are late Archaic in origin, then the artifact assemblage associated with the figurines would include woven sandals of yucca, human hair, fur string, awls, bone beads, snare sticks, basketry, cactus quids, an atlatl fragment, two sticks tied together, Gypsum points, Elko points, milling stones, handstones, a chopper, an end scraper, a worked quartz crystal, a piece of engraved slate, a perforated stone, and evidence of corn. Pictographs were found on the canyon wall below the cave. (11) Cottonwood Cave (Gunnerson 1969) In 1930, the Claflin-Emerson expedition excavated a rock shelter on the western side of the Colorado River near Waterhole Flats in Utah. One stick figurine was recovered in addition to numerous other artifacts and nine cists including one which was sealed and contained a scrap of leather, cedar bark, and a poorly fired unsmoothed miniature vessel. The list of artifacts includes one yucca sandal, a few split-twigs, a lump of clay, two lumps of pitch, two stemmed projectile points, two retouched flakes, two grinding stones, two bone artifacts, a wooden sickle(?), a molded cylinder of red pigment showing punctations, a fragmentary twined bag, basketry fragments, several pieces of cordage, and five ears of corn in a bark bundle. The expedition also collected seven intrusive sherds and noted the presence of several anthropomorphic pictographs at the north end of the shelter. (12) Moonshine Cave (Pendergast 1961) This cave is a small alcove on Mill Creek tributary of the Colorado River near Moab, Utah. From the badly disturbed and partially excavated deposits, one stick figurine and two possible fragments were recovered. Other arti- facts found include one hammerstone, nine utilized flakes, one stemmed point, two hand- stone fragments, one milling stone fragment, three pieces of cordage and two knotted fibers all of yucca, three pieces of worked wood, some unmodified animal bones, and a number of corncobs. Pictographs were also found close to the cave. (13) Green River (Tripp 196 7) Two figurines made of willow were dis- covered under an overhang west of Green River, Utah, in 1966. The report does not indicate whether or not any other cultural evidence was found associated with these figurines. The construction of these figurines appears to be similar to those found in Etna Cave and Cowboy Cave, and thus they are different from those found in the Grand Canyon area. (14) Moab (Pierson and Anderson 1975) One figurine was found in a rock shelter ten miles to the northwest of Moab, Utah, in 1973. Also recovered or noted in the shelter were fragments of cane and bone, pinyon shells, acorn shells, oak leaves, fragments of a metate, and a single corn cob. (15) Walters Cave (Jennings 19 75) A single fragmentary head of a figurine was recovered from Walters Cave next to Cowboy Cave near Canyonlands National Park. Five stratigraphic and occupational units were noted at this site, and are believed to duplicate and correlate directly with the five units from Cowboy Cave to be described below. The figurine was recovered from Unit IV.</page><page sequence="7">260 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 2, 1977] (16) Cowboy Cave (Jennings 1975) This cave site is located on a side canyon of Barrier Creek near the Maze District of Canyonlands National Park in Utah. Twenty specimens of split-twig figurines (Fig. 2) were found scattered throughout the midden deposits at this site which is upstream from Horseshoe Canyon where the Great Gallery pictograph panel is located. At Cowboy Cave more than 100 cubic meters (about 95%) of the stratified cultural deposits which were up to two meters deep were excavated in the summer of 1975. There were five major stratigraphic components: Unit I, the earliest, contained a layer of animal dung dated at 11 810?140 P.B. (UGa-636). This dung is primarily Bison sp., but sloth, horse, and others may also be represented. No signifi- cant evidence of human occupation was noted in this unit Major components II and III represent.an early Archaic occupation in the cave. Five radiocarbon dates from this early occupation range from about 6300 to 8300 B.P. Units IV and V constitute a late Archaic occupation ranging between 2100 and 1500 B.P. Eight of the stick figurines are from the upper portion of Unit IV, six are from the lower portion of Unit V, and six are of undetermined provenience. From Unit IV there are two radiocarbon dates available. A cache of shelled corn, about six kg, was found in two skin bags in a shallow pit in the upper portion of Unit IV. The corn has an adjusted radiocarbon date of 2075 ? 70 B.P. (SI-2422) while the adjusted date for a pad of grass that was in the pit overlying the skin bags is 1840 ? 65 B.P. (SI-2423). Two stick figurines were submitted for dating from the upper portion of Unit IV, but were lost in transit.

The lower portion of Unit V has a radio- carbon date of 1495 ? 60 B.P. (SI-2425) and the upper portion has a date of 1580 ? 60 B.P. (SI-2426). Although these two dates are stratigraphically reversed, they are close enough to fall within one standard deviation of each other. These dates are corroborated by the presence of Rose Springs projectile points which are believed to have been introduced in the area around A.D. 400-500. The abundance of grass chaff in both the early and late phases of occupation at the site in conjunction with the heavy occurrences of handstones and milling stones throughout the span of occupation indicate that this site was used primarily as a grass and seed gathering station. The early occupation (Units II and III) shows a definite lack of artifacts in comparison to the upper units (IV and V). The early occupation is dominated by a plain weave yucca sandal, and bits and pieces of fur and hide. Only eight fragments of basketry came from these units, all of which were one rod and bundle or one rod and welt, and 62% (104) of all of the pieces of two ply cordage from these units are of the Z-twist variety. Northern side-notched and Elko series projectile points were recovered from these two units. In the late occupation, Units IV and V, 27 Gypsum points were recovered, 24 Elko series points, and 8 Rose Springs points from Unit V only. Atlatl parts of wood occur in both the early and late occupations (Units III, IV, and V) but arrowshafts and arrow parts occur only in Unit V. Of the basketry in the upper two units 82% (40) are either one rod and bundle or one rod and welt, and of 86 pieces of two ply cordage, 55% are of the S-twist variety. Also from Units IV and V, 11 "problematical basketry objects" (Morss 1931:74) were recovered. These objects are also found along the Fremont River in what is believed to be Fremont context; however, they also occur in western Colorado at Dolores Cave and Tabeguache Cave II (Hurst 1944, 1947) in apparently preceramic contexts. Out- side of the shelled corn in the cache in Unit IV, very little evidence of corn was recovered from the upper units. Human and animal coprolites were common in both the early and late occupations; worked bone artifacts including awls, gaming pieces, and hyoid bone pendants were limited primarily to the upper units. Food bone scrap was severely limited in all units, only rabbit and rodent bones occurred in any quantity, and large ungulate bones were virtually absent. Incised and painted sandstones occur in both early and late units, while unfired clay figurines and clay spindle whorls are confined to Units III-V. Jennings (1975) tentatively assigned the early occupation to the Desha complex (Lindsay and others 1968), and the later occupation to Basketmaker II. CULTURAL AFFILIATION A comparison of known stick figurine sites with Cowboy Cave indicates that there are several commonly occurring artifacts found at these sites. These artifacts include yucca sandals of various types, cordage and fiber, basketry (one rod and bundle or welt at Cowboy Cave), handstones and milling stones, hammerstones, chipped stone tools including Gypsum points, bone and antler tools, pigments, shaped, in- cised, and painted sandstone and quartz crystals, and clay objects. The presence of both corncobs and shelled corn and the occurrence of pictograph panels near several of these sites is noteworthy. With the exception of corn, these cultural associations can all be considered part of a late Western Archaic adaptation. Thus the as- sociated artifacts and the radiocarbon dates for the stick figurines tend to support and reinforce the belief that split-twig figurines originated in an Archaic context during the second millen- nium B.C. and may have persisted until about 1500 B.P. in southern Utah. Previously, the Grand Canyon figurine com- plex was thought to be part of a late Archaic assemblage associated with the loosely defined Pinto complex (Euler and Olson 1965; Euler 1966). This hypothesized association was based. on the occurrence of Pinto points throughout the Southwest (Lister 1953) and on the dis- covery of the Red Butte lithic sites near the Grand Canyon, which are ascribed to a Pinto- Chiricahua-Amargosa II lithic industry (McNutt and Euler 1966).</page><page sequence="9">262 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 However, the most common projectile point found in association with the stick figurines from Cowboy Cave is the Gypsum point; Pinto series points do not even occur at Cowboy Cave. This poses a problem since Pinto and Gypsum points have often been grouped to- gether as the Pinto-Gypsum series; but recent excavation at O'Malley Shelter (Fowler and others 1973) revealed that Pinto points and Gypsum points originate in stratigraphically distinct contexts. At this site, two distinct Archaic occupations were noted (Fowler and others 1973:56). The first, which ranged from about 7200 B.P. to 6500 B.P., contained the largest percentage of Pinto points; the second occupation ranged from about 4600 B.P. to about 3000 B.P. and contained the largest percentage of Gypsum points at the site. The dates for the second occupation which con- tained the Gypsum points accord neatly with the dates for split-twig figurines. This chronological and stratigraphical dis- tinction between Gypsum and Pinto points is replicated at Sudden Shelter (Jennings and others n.d.), a stratified Archaic rock shelter in central Utah. There, Pinto points also precede Gypsum points and the time span associated with each type seems to correspond with the temporal span at O'Malley Shelter. The analysis of the Gypsum points and other point types from Sudden Shelter is based on a discriminate analysis of morphological char- acteristics. This statistical analysis produces "average" measurements against which un- identified points can be compared. It appears that many of the "stemmed" projectile points found at stick figurine sites would probably fall within this statistical classification of Gypsum points. Thus, the association of Gypsum points with stick figurines at Cowboy Cave and the ac- cordance of the temporal span of these points with the radiocarbon dates obtained for split- twig figurines themselves indicate that if the complex associated with stick figurines is to be named after a point type, a Gypsum rather than a Pinto complex is implied. The only other named complex that the figurines may be associated with is the Desha complex (Lindsay and others 1968). This com- plex was defined on the basis of excavation of two caves near Navajo Mountain in southern Utah. The complex is difficult to evaluate due to the nature of the excavation and the limited artifact inventory. Jennings (1975) notes that much of the material from Cowboy Cave including artifacts associated with the figurines resemble artifacts from the Desha complex. In a final definition of the cultural affiliation of the Grand Canyon figurine complex, the presence of corn at several of the figurine sites must be accounted for. It appears that in several cases, i.e., Etna Cave, Moonshine Cave, and Cowboy Cave, the presence of corn led the excavator to attribute a late occupation to Basketmaker II. However, many Basketmaker II traits are lacking in these occupations, in particular, distinctive Basketmaker sandals and two-rod and bundle basketry. It is conceivable that the corn was intrusive in all cases, but the possibility of a relatively early introduction of corn into a late Archaic non-Basketmaker con- text in conjunction with the spread or use of split-twig figurines must be seriously entertain- ed and examined. Other cultural associations that must be examined in relation to the Grand Canyon figurine complex are the pictographs found near a few of the sites. Some may be just fortuitous associations, but others such as the Great Gallery panel near Cowboy Cave seem to have been executed by Archaic populations (Schaafsma 1971:135). This particular style, referred to as the Barrier Canyon Style, appears to precede all other styles known in Utah and shows many stylistic similarities to the Western Archaic Pecos River Style in Texas which may date to several millennia B.C. (Schaafsma 1971:135). Schaafsma points out that the similarities are quite specific even though the areas are geographically distinct and widely separated. A suggested relationship between south- western Texas and southeastern Utah based solely on pictograph similarities could be chal- lenged; however the painted sandstone and the clay figurines found at Cowboy Cave seem to have parallel counterparts in this same area of Texas (i.e., figurines, Schafer 1975; painted pebbles, Schafer 1975:150; Greer and Treat 1975). These parallels in non-utilitarian objects argue against a spurious relationship between these two areas. Any definition of the Grand Canyon figurine complex that includes clay figurines, painted sandstone, and Barrier Can- yon Style pictographs must address the</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS 263 question of a relationship between Texas and Utah. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPLIT-TWIG FIGURINE SITES The listing of artifacts found associated with stick figurines and a definition of the cultural affiliations of the Grand Canyon figurine com- plex is not sufficient to explain the archaeologi- cal contexts of these finds nor the geographical distribution of the known figurine sites. Broadly speaking, the 16 known figurine sites can be classed into two distinct groups. The first group consists of five relatively inac- cessible cave sites clustered in a small area of the upper Grand Canyon along the Colorado River. At these sites the stick figurines are almost always found without any cultural association whatsoever. The figurines them- selves occur in relative abundance in this area (about 75% of all known figurines have been found here), and are found either in caches along the cave wall or scattered on the surface. Several stick figurines from this area are pierced with slender cottonwood "spears." The sites included in this group are Luka Cave, Stantons Cave, Tse-An-Sha, White Cave, and Tse-An- Kaetan. The other 11 remaining sites from Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah fall into the second group. Sites in this group are generally more accessible although the stick figurines are not so abundant. Figurines are not found in caches but scattered throughout the deposits, e.g., Etna Cave, Cowboy Cave, and Walters Cave, and none are ever pierced or "speared." Some of the stick figurines from sites in this group, especially those from Etna Cave, Cow- boy Cave, Walters Cave, and the Green River site, show some variations in construction from split-twig figurines found at sites in the first group. The most important difference between the two groups of sites is that at almost every site in the second group, stick figurines are found associated with some type of cultural inventory, however slight or non-diagnostic. It is hypothesized that the distinction between these two groups of sites results from a functional change over time in the use of the split-twig figurines. Assuming that a change in the archaeological context in which an artifact is found signifies an alteration in function or a shift in utilization, then it is postulated that there is a functional difference between figurines found at these two groups of sites. This differentiation also appears to represent a chronological difference. In the first group of sites, the stick figurines are found intact, sometimes speared, and care- fully placed in caches. Thus, the inferred functional interpretation, that the figurines were magico-religious objects used in a hunting ritual, seems to hold fairly well. In the second group of sites, the archaeological context of the stick figurines is completely different. The figurines are sometimes found crushed and fragmented, and scattered throughout the mid- den debris in habitation areas, e.g., Etna Cave and Cowboy Cave. It is inferred from this difference of context that the function or meaning of the split-twig figurines differed as well. For example, perhaps they were recrea- tional items such as toys or playthings rather than ritual items. It is also hypothesized that the location of the first group of sites constitutes a core area or focal area of development for split-twig fig- urines. From this area the trait spread to adjacent areas along the tributaries of the Colorado River, and as it spread its function changed. Implicit in this suggestion is the assumption that the direction of functional change is from a ritual object to a general social item, rather than the reverse. The apparent late radiocarbon dates associated with the figurines from Cowboy Cave tend to support this hypo- thesis as do the cultural associations from Etna Cave. CONCLUSIONS An examination of all known split-twig figurine sites indicates that the stick figurine developed as a cultural trait during the second millennium B.C. by Archaic hunting and gather- ing populations in the Grand Canyon area, and possibly persisted in outlying areas for another thousand years. The exact cultural affiliation of the Grand Canyon figurine complex is not completely identified, but the artifact assemblage includes a technological complex associated with the late Western Archaic, which on the basis of Cowboy Cave excavation, includes the Gypsum point as the dominant diagnostic artifact. Also included in this assemblage are a number of non-utilitarian items such as painted and incised</page><page sequence="11">264 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Vol. 42, No. 2, 19771 sandstone, pigments, and clay objects. The presence of corn and pictographs near some of these figurine sites poses some enigmatic ques- tions about wider cultural associations. More radiocarbon dates on the stick figurines themselves, and the discovery and excavation of more figurine sites will either substantiate or contradict the hypothesis that the stick figurine developed as a magico- religious object in the Grand Canyon area and changed functionally as it spread along the tributaries of the Colorado River.
