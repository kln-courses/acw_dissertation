<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIR KARL RAIMUND POPPER, C.H., F.B.A. 28 July 1902-17 September 1994 Elected F.R.S. 1976 BY DAVID MILLER Department of Philosophy, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL UK Karl Raimund Popper, the philosopher and methodologist of science, died on 17 September 1994 at the age of 92 years. Locke was a Fellow of the Royal Society, of course, and some other early Fellows, Boyle in particular, have a secure place in the history of philosophy. Whewell, an intellectual forerunner of Popper's (Medawar 1967), was elected in 1820 when the Royal Society was, according to a contemporary philosopher, 'in a state of unstable equilibrium'; he was a mere 26, a lecturer in mathematics, and was to occupy the chair of mineralogy at Cambridge for some years before writing his exceptional studies in the history and philosophy of science. Whitehead and Russell were elected as Fellows for their mathematical work, as have been one or two more recently elected logicians. Popper is the only philosopher in modem times to have been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society primarily in recognition of his philosophical achievement. Popper's intellectual life spanned more than 75 years, with little interruption. He worked, and thought, and wrote, and rethought, and rewrote, almost unceasingly. He made outstanding (in some cases revolutionary) advances in the philosophy of science, the theory of probability, the theory of knowledge, metaphysics, social and political philosophy, and the philosophy of history; he contributed importantly (usually controversially) to our understanding of logic, the history of philosophy (especially the pre-Socratics, Plato and Marx), classical mechanics, classical thermodynamics, quantum physics, evolutionary biology, psychology and music. Magee (1997, p. 211) writes: 'No other thinker of the twentieth century has come anywhere near matching ... [Popper's] range of effectiveness as a destroyer of the dominant myths of the age ...To the end of his life he was astonishingly fertile in new ideas.' Popper's list of publications contains over 1200 entries, including reprints and translations, and his archive (up to 1985) occupies 463 manuscript boxes in the library of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University (the University of Klagenfurt in Austria has a complete photocopy; a further copy is held on 473 rolls of microfilm at the London School of Economics).

IN VIENNA, 1902-36 Popper was born on 28 July 1902 at Himmelhof in Ober St Veit on the western outskirts of Vienna, the only son of Dr Simon Siegmund Carl Popper and Jenny Popper (nee Schiff). His sister Dora (Emilie Dorothea) was then eight years old, his sister Annie (Anna Lydia) four. His parents were Jewish, but had converted to the Protestant faith. His mother, who was born in Vienna in 1864, came from a richly musical family; her parents were founder-members of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, and she and her two sisters were talented pianists. Popper's father, whose family came from Kolin, was born in 1856 in Roudnice nad Labem (Raudnitz) in what is now the Czech Republic. He was brought up separately from his two brothers, but the three followed the same career, becoming doctors of law of the University of Vienna. He was a cultivated man, historian, poet, social theorist, 'really more of a scholar than a lawyer' according to his son. The Popper family lived in the centre of Vienna in the handsome 18th- century house at the corer of Freisingergasse and Bauernmarkt where Popper's father maintained his successful law practice (Geier 1994, p. 39). In ??2-6 of his intellectual autobiography Unended quest (23),* Popper has written movingly about one or two episodes in his childhood, and no more will be said about it here. Popper's father died in 1932, the year in which Dora Popper (who had been a nurse and also a civil servant) committed suicide during a bout of illness. Popper and his wife Hennie (Josefine Anna Henninger, born 1906) left Austria in 1937. His mother died in 1938, after a long illness. Some 16 members of the family died as a result of the Nazi terror. A month after her mother's death Annie Popper escaped to Paris and eventually to Switzerland, where she lived until her death in the 1970s. She wrote sentimental stories and novels, one of which, for example, relates the exploits of a female Tarzan. Between the ages of six and eleven Popper was educated in a private school; thereafter he attended the Franz Josef Gymnasium [366.3]. But he reports that, desperately bored in most of his lessons, he effectively left school at the age of 16. His first attempt at the Matura-the entrance examination for the University-was unsuccessful, as he failed in two subjects (one failure could be condoned): logic and Latin. In logic he was examined by Edgar Zilsel, later a member of the Vienna Circle, with whom he had a disagreement about Aristotelian logic (probably about the existential commitment of universal quantification). The Latin examination required the oral translation of an unseen Horace ode. In 1922, the second attempt at the Matura was successful; there was no conflict with his logic examiner, and the Horace ode was perhaps less unseen than the earlier one had been. Popper remained at the University until 1928. He studied mathematics formally with Hahn, Helly, Furtwangler and Menger; physics with Ehrenhaft, Lecher and Thirring; psychology with Biihler; and philosophy with Heinrich Gomperz and Schlick. But he did many things besides. He tried his hand as a manual worker. This was not a success. From about 1917 he * References in this form refer to the bibliography at the end of the text.

But after the callous shooting of unarmed demonstrators by the police in Horlgasse in 1919, he turned against the cynical readiness of Marxists to sacrifice others' lives for indeterminate ideals. Despite misgivings, he remained sympathetic to the social democratic movement; and, although never a pacifist, even to pacifism (Kiesewetter 1995, p. 278). For some years after 1920 he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. This too was not an unqualified success. (Years later, in New Zealand, he designed and had made some handsome furniture in a somewhat functional style.) He worked in Adler's child guidance clinic, and later did social work with neglected children. In 1923 he qualified as a primary school teacher. After sampling, and not much liking, the music performed in Schoenberg's Verein fiir musikalische Privatauffiihrungen, he sought admission in 1922 or 1923 to the Vienna Konservatorium, writing for this purpose an organ fugue in F sharp minor. He later said of this fugue, which was first publicly performed in 1992 by Dame Gillian Weir, that it was an attempt to honour Bach through its second subject, 'a quotation from Bach's Passion Music According to St Matthew' (39). The pianist Julien Musafia, who has arranged the fugue as a piano work for four hands, describes it as 'a composition of romantic impulse vested in baroque form-it would have been a most creditable piece of work to have submitted at the end of his studies at the Konservatorium, let alone at the beginning' (1996, personal communication). But Popper, convinced that he was not talented enough to become a professional musician, stayed only one year. In a statement, written a decade later, of the details of his education Popper wrote [366.3]: '[In 1925] I understood that circumstances in Austria would not permit me to obtain an official position at the university.' This doubtless alludes not only to the prevalent anti-semitic sentiment, but also to Popper's relative remoteness from philosophers of influence; the academic establishment in those days was for the most part conservative, clerical and catholic, and not natural quarters for an independent-minded social democrat such as Popper. 'I therefore decided to prepare myself for a post at the public school. I attended lectures on education and began to deal with paedagogic problems ....' The City of Vienna had recently opened its new Pedagogic Institute, in which Popper enrolled. It was there that he met his wife, Hennie, who was training as a physical education teacher. He attended Btihler's university lectures on psychology, and discovered the doctrines of the Wurzburg school, especially those of Kulpe and Selz. But although attracted by many of these doctrines, particularly the doctrine that thinking develops not through the passive association of ideas but under the active impulse of problem-solving, Popper was becoming persuaded that logic is the key to psychology, not the other way round (22, chapter 1, ?10); that the growth of knowledge can be understood only if its logic is understood. His Ph.D. dissertation of 1928, 'Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie' ('On the problem of method in the psychology of thinking'), examined by Biihler (who praised it very highly [406.1]') and Schlick, the founder of the Vienna Circle, marked a turning point; thereafter he never wavered from the view that scientific knowledge, though humanly created, is objective knowledge, and must be analysed in objectivist terms. The thesis "Gewohnheit" und "Gesetzerlebnis" in der Erziehung' ("'Habit" and 'experience of laws" in education') submitted to the Pedagogic Institute in 1927 or 1928 was never properly finished. Popper's interest in the logic and methodology of science had started long before his attendance at Biihler's lectures. He has related on more than one occasion (16, chapter 1; 23, ?8) the story of his realization, in 1919, that what is distinctive about the best scientific 371</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs theories, those that contribute most to our understanding and our knowledge, is not that experience invariably confirms them, but that it invariably challenges them, by exposing them to the risk of falsification. He contrasted general relativity, whose daring prediction that light rays bend in gravitational fields had recently been tested by Eddington's eclipse observations at Sobral and Principe, with pseudoscientific doctrines-he cited vulgar Marxism and psychoanalysis-whose principal claim to attention seems to be their ability to explain anything and everything that might happen. The predictions of some astrologers and fortune-tellers are similar, cautiously or ambiguously phrased so as to fit any future contingency. Popper noticed that such plasticity, such ability to explain anything, whatever it is, is not a virtue in a theory; on the contrary, it reveals that the theory excludes nothing, that it has no empirical content. To be sure, a successful theory will explain a great deal, perhaps everything, that does happen within its domain; what it must not do is explain everything that might happen. A theory, Popper's criterion of demarcation says, must be falsifiable in principle if it is to belong to empirical science, if it is to say anything about the world that we experience. But it is of course desirable that, despite multifarious attempts at falsification, it should be unfalsified in practice. If a theory is to be informative, it must take risks; if it is to be correct, it must survive. Popper has attributed his appreciation of the virtue of daring speculation in scientific hypotheses to the intrepidity of the polar explorer Nansen, one of his boyhood heroes (43, pp. 321f.; Kiesewetter 1995, pp. 278f.). His appreciation of the fact that a theory may pass any number of tests and still be false he attributed to the supersession of Newtonian gravitational theory by general relativity. Indeed, he often declared that without Einstein's revolution he would have remained a Kantian, convinced that classical mechanics was the final truth. The most long-lasting and sympathetic philosophical influence during these student years was Julius Kraft, a philosopher of law from Gottingen, who had studied with Leonard Nelson. Kraft and Popper had many informal conversations during 1924-25, their arguments revolving round profound difficulties that each saw in Kant's synthetic a priori, the doctrine that we can know what we do know about the world of experience only if some of the most fundamental things we know (for instance that space is three-dimensional and Euclidean) are available to us independently of experience. Like Kant himself, Kraft and Popper were anxious to avoid the sceptical abrogation of rationality into which Hume had toppled, but they were in stark disagreement about how to avoid it (15, pp. 4-6). Popper for one already knew that some of Kant's synthetic a priori propositions had been refuted. But it was only at the end of his student days that it become clear to him that if scientific theories boldly anticipate experience they cannot be staidly grounded in experience. The traditional creed, proclaimed by Bacon and institutionalized by J.S. Mill, that science advances from facts to generalizations by a logically defensible process of induction, must be rejected both as psychology and as logic. Our theories are not born out of experience, nor are they always borne out by it. Psychologically theories are conjectures, guesses whose role-as the Wurzburg school emphasized-is to solve problems, to probe the unknown, not merely to organize what is already known (itself, admittedly, sometimes also a problem). The same holds in logic. No universal theory or prediction follows from the known facts by any logical process (Hume had shown this 150 years before); there is no inductive logic. Facts, observations, experiments, these serve in science not as a foundation, or even a support, for the theoretical superstructure, but only as tests of its correctness. Although no accumulation of experiences can verify a universal theory, or even provide grounds for supposing it to be true, one counterexample, if upheld, will falsify it. This, in brief, is the method of conjectures and refutations, Popper's solution to the 372</page><page sequence="6">Karl Raimund Popper problem of induction, his resolution of the Kantian problem of how the intellectual (a priori) and the experiential (a posteriori) components of human knowledge are integrated. Much criticized, endlessly dissected, in the last 70 years, it has gladdened scientists with its insistence that their work is inventive and imaginative; comforted those brought up to believe that only the maladroit make mistakes; and cheered those troubled by humean scepticism about induction. There is no induction. But there need not be scepticism either. Our knowledge can grow, provided we forego the traditional demand for theories that are verified, or proved, or justified, and ask no more than that they be correct. A correct guess is not beyond us, if we are lucky, though we can never be sure that we have made one. Scientific discovery differs from commonsense (and even animal) learning not, as Bacon thought, in its avoidance of parti pris and prejudice, for scientists too jump to conclusions. The difference is that a conclusion in science marks the beginning of the investigation, not the end of it; it is through its self-conscious use of the critical method to identify and eliminate errors that scientific thinking (more generally, rational thinking) is distinguished from animal thinking; 'from the amoeba to Einstein is just one step' (22, chapter 6, ?xx). In 1929 Popper submitted to the Pedagogic Institute a third thesis, entitled 'Axiome, Definitionen und Postulate der Geometrie' ('Axioms, definitions and postulates of geometry')[4.6], to qualify as a science teacher in lower secondary schools. In 1930, the year of his marriage, he was appointed to his first official teaching position. He continued to think and write without respite. At about this time he met Herbert Feigl, one of the younger members of the Vienna Circle. This group, sometimes known as 'logical positivists' or 'logical empiricists', combined an enthusiasm for contemporary mathematical logic with traditional positivistic emphases on certainty and on the epistemological priority of sense experience. Although Popper's views on demarcation and induction had been developed, partly in discussions with Kraft, as an extension and correction of the philosophies of Kant, Fries, and Nelson, and not deliberately in opposition to the ideas of the Vienna Circle, he had long known that they conflicted on numerous points with the Circle's views, pre-eminently its doctrine (derived from Wittgenstein, not himself a member of the Circle) that empirical verifiability provides a criterion of meaningfulness (and the consequence that metaphysics is meaningless). Feigl persuaded him that his criticisms of the Circle were so significant that they should be published as a book. In response, Popper, who had so far published only a few short articles on educational topics, planned a huge work, Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie (The two fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge), in two volumes, entitled Das Induktionsproblem (The problem of induction) and Das Abgrenzungsproblem (The problem of demarcation). Never quite finished, it was abridged, then expanded, then abridged again. The result was Logik der Forschung (1), translated into English as The logic of scientific discovery (14). What survives of the original two-volume typescript was published as (28), but is not yet available in English. The fate of the intermediate typescripts is unknown (Hansen 1974). LOGIK DER FORSCHUNG The opening chapters of Logik der Forschung state with stunning clarity and succinctness all the cardinal theses of falsificationism, the methodology of conjectures and refutations. (a) Induction is not only fallacious but unnecessary. The so-called inductive method is 373</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs replaced by 'the deductive method of testing, ... the view that a hypothesis can only be empirically tested-and only after it has been advanced' (?1). (b) Hypotheses are to be entertained in science if and only if they are empirically falsifiable. It is admitted that any hypothesis can be rescued from falsification by sufficiently drastic adjustments, for example by postulating ad hoc the existence of previously unknown entities or effects; but it is at the heart of the scientific approach, if not its unvarying practice, to exclude evasive tactics of this kind (?6). (c) If we want science to progress, we must not be frightened of mistakes, but we must adopt methodological rules whose overriding objective is to encourage falsification of our theories and the elimination of the mistaken ones among them (? 11). (d) Methodology is not to be identified, as positivists identify it, with the empirical discipline of describing how scientists behave, for even the underlying demarcation of scientists from others depends on the adoption of a decision or convention (?4). (e) The basic statements with which scientific theories are confronted in tests are themselves conjectural. Science makes no appeal to incorrigible perceptions or perception statements, and 'the empirical basis' is a conventional-though far from arbitrary-stopping point, not an absolute one. No falsification, accordingly, is ever conclusive (but that does not preclude its being a falsification): 'If you insist on ... strict disproof ... in the empirical sciences, you will never benefit from experience, and never learn from it how wrong you are' (?9). Succeeding chapters elaborate on these theses, and others. A major topic of the book is probability. Popper noted in ?34 that the word 'probability' has many meanings, and he distinguished between the physical probability of an event or type of event, and what he called the logical probability of a statement or theory, which he showed to be inversely related to its empirical content and its degree of falsifiability: the more a theory says, the more it forbids, the more opportunities it offers for falsification, and the less likely it is to be true. He claimed as an immediate consequence that science cannot be interested in obtaining probable theories (?83). In a long chapter devoted to physical probability he dismissed subjectivist apologies that explain it as no more than a compensation for ignorance, and grappled with two major problems in the only extant objectivist theory, that of von Mises, according to which probabilities are the limits to which relative frequencies tend in indefinitely long random reference classes (collectives). The problem of decidability asks how statements of probability, which are 'in principle impervious to strict falsification' (proem to Chapter VIII), can nonetheless belong to empirical science; a crucial challenge to the criterion of demarcation. The fundamental problem of the theory of chance (?49) asks for an explanation of why random sequences are statistically stable. (Mises offers little here, as collectives are defined as sequences that are both random and stable.) Popper proposed, but did not fully harmonize, two solutions to the problem of decidability. One, quite in accord with the procedures of classical statistics, involves the adoption of methodological rules to permit the falsification of probabilistic or statistical statements. The other, more original, shows that the attribution of randomness itself is falsifiable if we extend the idea to finite sequences. Although Popper's account of finite random sequences, one of the earliest, is not wholly satisfactory (Ville 1939; Delahaye 1994, p. 35), it does suggest a solution also to the fundamental problem of the theory of chance; for sequences that are random from the start are, he showed, always statistically stable. Despite the popularity of the verifiability criterion of meaning, it was usually conceded that no quantity of empirical evidence can turn a scientific theory into a certainty; most philosophers, even in the Vienna Circle, were fallibilists with regard to theories, though not 374</page><page sequence="8">Karl Raimund Popper with regard to statements of evidence. It was claimed, nevertheless, and still is claimed, that certainty can be approached; theories can be made more and more probable (in the sense of logical probability), and in this way the problem of learning from experience, which is identical with the problem of induction, solved. The conditional (or as Popper preferred to call it, relative) probability p(h I e) of a hypothesis or theory h on evidence e was treated as a measure of the partial deducibility of h from e (ranging from unity, when h is deducible from e, to zero when h contradicts e); and-on the supposition that induction is generalized deduction-it was therefore thought that p(h I e) adequately measures the degree to which h is empirically or inductively supported by e. In the final chapter of the book Popper gave a detailed repudiation of the view, especially in the forms advanced by Reichenbach and by Keynes, that the problem of induction can be tackled by such considerations of probability. There are three items at issue here: the updated probability p(h I e) of the theory h; the degree to which h has withstood the tests whose results are described by e (Popper called this the degree of corroboration of h); and what e tells us about the truth value of h. Popper argued that the first two are distinct, and that, unless the theory is refuted, neither is a measure of the third; for empirical evidence can teach us nothing about a theory except that it is false. In the years to come, criticism of appeals to probability was to be a constant theme in his unrelenting attacks on the philosophy of induction. Logik der Forschung contains also a substantial chapter criticizing the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a topic apparently distant from methodology. But it is a natural consequence of Popper's insistence on the objectivity of scientific knowledge that he should have sought to purge quantum theory of the subjectivism implanted into it by Heisenberg, in particular the subjectivist interpretation of probabilities as measures of ignorance rather than as statistical frequencies. Popper later changed his mind on the interpretation of quantum-mechanical probabilities (without weakening the demand for objectivity), and it is convenient to postpone the summary of his criticisms of the Copenhagen school until something has been said about the propensity interpretation of probability, which he first proposed in the 1950s. A teacher in a lower secondary school when this marvellous book was being written, and still a teacher when it was published late in 1934, Popper was becoming restless. His abilities, even in science and mathematics, were not being used. He had begun to meet other members of the Vienna Circle, especially Carnap, who was to be his principal defender among the logical empiricists, and G6del, as well as distinguished visitors to Vienna, such as Heisenberg in 1935 (30, Preface, ?111). But by 1935 Camap and Godel rarely took part in meetings of the Circle (Menger 1974), and Popper himself was never invited there. He did speak at some of the peripheral meetings, and a talk he gave on randomness at Menger's 'mathematisches Colloquium' in 1935 first sparked the interest of Wald in the theory of probability. He began to attend international conferences, beginning with the Circle's 'Vorkonferenz' in Prague in 1934. There he met Tarski, who in Vienna shortly afterwards explained to him his celebrated 'semantic conception of truth'. This was a momentous occasion for Popper, who had previously been a realist with an uneasy conscience, unable to make clear to himself how to reconcile the commonsense idea of truth with common sense; that is, how to spell out the correspondence between true statements and facts. Thereafter he championed Tarski's ideas on unnumbered occasions (not always in a way that appealed to all of Tarski's other champions). The rehabilitation, as he called it later, of the commonsense idea of truth is of decisive importance for Popper's philosophy, as it embodies an indispensable distinction 375</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs between truth and justified truth. Philosophers since Plato have been much more interested in what can be justified to be true-conclusively or inconclusively-than in what is true; the demand for knowledge, rather than mere opinion, insistently proclaims this preference. In positivism the preference becomes acute, and truth is identified with what can be known. In contrast, a genuine conjecture is plainly a statement that we think may be true even if we cannot know it; not only may it be true-and-not-justified but it may be true-and-not-justifiable. During the academic year 1935-36 Popper took leave without pay from his teaching position, in order to accept invitations to speak abroad (Hacohen 1996, p. 457). He visited London, Cambridge, Oxford, Brussels, Utrecht, and Copenhagen; he met Russell, Moore, Schr6dinger, Hayek, Crawfoot, Woodger, Haldane, Beral, Waddington, Oppenheim, Bohr, and others. He continued to be restless. As noted above, he had known for years that he had almost no hope of a university position in Austria; and not much help was offered by Austrian friends who had already obtained posts abroad. At the end of October 1936 he applied (at Woodger's suggestion) to the Universities Bureau of the British Empire for the Professorship of Philosophy in the Department of Education &amp; Philosophy, Canterbury University College, Christchurch, one of four constituent colleges of the federal University of New Zealand, naming Moore and Woodger as referees; and secondarily for a simultaneously advertised lectureship. I.L.G. Sutherland from Wellington, who had obtained his doctorate in Glasgow in 1923 with a thesis in what we now call moral psychology, a man five years Popper's senior, was appointed to the chair. Popper was appointed to the lectureship. Hurriedly leaving Vienna at the beginning of 1937, the Poppers went into exile on the other side of the world ('halfway to the moon' as Hennie described it). It should not be supposed that Logik der Forschung was the first work to reject inductivism and to advocate the hypothetical method. Liebig (1865) and Bernard (1865) had done so, and Whewell (1840), though a believer in the power of empirical evidence to establish the truth of scientific theories, had made plain that hypotheses are essential if science is to have any theories to establish (Medawar 1967). Popper referred to Liebig, but seems to have known nothing of Bernard and Whewell (or of Bachelard, who was saying similar things in France). Yet Popper's originality is not to be doubted. He was the first to stress that the hypothetical character of a theory is never mitigated, however numerous and however breathtaking its empirical successes, and he was the first to confront inductivism with a systematic alternative methodology, in which evidence plays no positive role in the assessment of theories. Indeed, it is not so much inductivism that he demolished, as justificationism; the view that the rationality of science (and other intellectual activities) consists in the pursuit and attainment of (wholly or partially) justified truth, rather than of truth. Critics of falsificationism nearly all stumble at this point, and ascribe to it precisely those justificationist aspirations that it is at such pains to discard. This partly explains why Popper was so dismissive of so many of the objections that purported to attack his views. He encourages us to see science as a reckless human activity, whose extraordinary purchase on the truth about this strange and beautiful world is not less genuine for being quite unsecured. To quote one of his favourite lines from Xenophanes (16, ? xv): 'all is but a woven web of guesses'. 376</page><page sequence="10">Karl Raimund Popper IN NEW ZEALAND, 193745 In 1937 the Department of Education &amp; Philosophy at Canterbury University College had two professors, one lecturer, one full-time assistant lecturer, two part-time assistants and about 80-100 students [366.3]. Sutherland, the new Professor of Philosophy, was by that time really an anthropologist, an expert in Maori affairs, a man who had been honoured by the Ngati Porou people with the ancestral name Paikea (Beaglehole et al. 1952). Popper was the only active philosopher, and did all the teaching in philosophy, fettered to a syllabus that 'had advanced from Aristotle to Bacon but no further in the logical alphabet' (Godsiff 1972). Writing to Camap in 1943 he reported 'an extensive as well as exhaustive lecturing programme' of six courses, and complained that his 'hatred against the empty verbalism and scholasticism of the vast majority of philosophical writings is increasing proportionally with the time I have to devote to the teaching of such matters' [282.24]. More to his liking was a course for research workers on Scientific Methods (with discussion of their practical research problems, which have led to considerable practical results; a kind of poli-clinical advisory agency for agricultural chemists etc.). This course ... was very interesting and successful. It is comforting to find that philosophy can be of some practical use! He contributed to other extramural courses too; for example, to a series of University Extension Lectures in 1940 on religion [366.20], and to a W.E.A. course 'Science in the making', for which he produced substantial typewritten notes [366.24]. His enthusiasm and vitality became famous beyond Christchurch: he 'acted as a kind of intellectual champagne after the dry depression years. ... Staff and students alike crowded his open lectures not for instruction or information, but for enlightenment and the sheer intellectual joy of exploring the unknown with him' (Gardner et al. 1973, pp. 263; quoted in Bartley 1982, p. 253). The short lecture course that Popper was invited to give in Dunedin in 1944 attracted large crowds in the same way (Eccles 1982, p. 221). It had the notable effect also of converting a naive believer in induction (as Eccles described himself) into one of the most vigorous of all scientific advocates of the method of conjectures and refutations. Although he was promoted to Senior Lecturer as soon as the rank was introduced at the beginning of 1941, Popper felt unappreciated and unrewarded in the Department at Canterbury. There were endless disputes with Sutherland, his superior, blowing up at one point in 1940 into a formal request from Popper to the Rector 'for an enquiry into my loyalty to the British cause and into my competence to lecture on the present war-issues', which, he suspected, had been called into question. To this the Rector replied [366.5]; 'I wish to leave no shadow of doubt regarding my well founded and firm conviction in your absolute loyalty to the British cause in this war. ... I have observed that your influence on your students is of the nature of a strong ethical appeal, backed by personal experience, in support of the British cause.' In 1944, apparently in the aftermath of some quarrel over the distribution of examiners' fees, Popper wrote to the Chairman of Council that: 'For a number of years, co- operation in the department of philosophy between Professor Sutherland and myself has become increasingly difficult, in spite of my earnest endeavour to facilitate such co-operation. The position has now reached such a state that I have no option but to request the Council to review the situation, and to clarify my duties and responsibilities.' Sutherland, he claimed, insinuated that he was neglecting his academic responsibilities, and described his protests as 'typical of behaviour that no Britisher or New Zealander would ever adopt' [366.5]. (This may 377</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs be one source of Popper's allusion later to '[t]he British habit of accepting hardship without grumbling' (16, ?7).) What lay behind this unreal accusation of dereliction of duty was Popper's attempt, against all odds, to introduce by example a research tradition into a university where such a thing was unknown, a university whose 'governing body ... seemed to regard time spent on research as time filched from the primary job of teaching' (Simkin 1993, p. 183). Throughout his life Popper had the strongest distaste for university politics, and it was probably his most conspicuous political achievement to have founded in the University of New Zealand the idea that research is an indispensable ingredient of university work (5; Gardner et al. 1973, pp. 264f.). Between 1937 and 1943 Popper began some important studies on the axiomatization of boolean algebra and probability theory. But his main research in this period was in social and political philosophy, a field rather less congenial to someone who-despite youthful enthusiasms-was 'neither by inclination nor by training a student of society or politics' [253.3]. Appalled by the tragedy that was engulfing Europe, not accepted for service in the New Zealand armed forces (Gardner et al. 1973, p. 262), he set himself as his war work the task of exposing the intellectual origins of totalitarianism, not only fascism but also communism, which he expected to become a major problem if the war against Hitler was won. In certain respects this work was a continuation of the criticism of Marxism that he had begun in 1919. At the centre of the target was a doctrine that he named historicism, the doctrine that the grand sweep of human history, if not its details, is ruled by historical laws or laws of destiny. Historicist myth-making infects most totalitarian thinking from Plato to Hegel and Marx, to Hitler and Stalin, and has been a crippling intellectual burden on mankind, and on man's attempt to make for himself a better life. The more analytical and methodological criticisms of historicism are contained in The poverty of historicism, originally published in three parts in Economica in 1944-45, later expanded and published in book form as (13); those that interweave more closely with metaphysical, ethical, and political issues, are contained in The open society and its enemies (3, 4), which Popper describes in his preface as 'a critical introduction to the philosophy of politics and of history, and an examination of some of the principles of social reconstruction'. Appropriately for a book that was once to be called 'A social philosophy for Everyman', The open society is written with transcendent clarity. But Popper wisely warns the reader that '[a]lthough the book presupposes nothing but open- mindedness in the reader, its object is not so much to popularize the questions treated as to solve them' (loc. cit.). The text of the book teems with arguments; the abundant footnotes, on a huge range of peripheral topics, only add to the profusion of thoughts. This is not the place to expound Popper's social and political views (Simkin 1993, Part II; Shearmur 1996), or his sustained critiques of Plato and Marx. But it may be said that these views are by no means independent of his earlier contributions to the theory of knowledge. Popper brought to the study of society the radical anti-authoritarianism that he had brought before to the study of science; in particular the belief that the reasonable demand for control should not be confused with the unreasonable demand for security. There is accordingly an insistence that, since mistakes are unavoidable, we must devote our energies more to their cure than to their prevention, and hence that social reform should be piecemeal and monitored rather than utopian and monolithic. Popper the advocate of revolutionary thinking in science-since bold new theories are easily disposed of, if they are false-is the same thinker as Popper the opponent of revolutionary activity in society. It is to be observed that anti- authoritarianism does not imply, as some recent writers and politicians have imagined, that 378</page><page sequence="12">Karl Raimund Popper state intervention is to be eschewed altogether. Indeed, Popper makes it plain that the state must be ready to intervene, if only to prevent others from intervening. A significant parallel is drawn (4, chapter 24, note 7) between this paradox of freedom (unrestrained freedom subverts freedom) and other paradoxes of sovereignty such as the paradox of majority rule (the people may vote for a tyrant), and the ancient logical paradox of the Liar ('This statement is false'). As noted below, a further significant parallel between the paradoxes of sovereignty and fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge was to be drawn later. Although the main theses of The open society are inevitably of concern to all thinking people, there are one or two matters raised in it that may be of particular interest to scientific men and women. There is, for example, the explanation of scientific objectivity in terms of inter-subjectivity (chapter 23), which acknowledges that individual scientists are not objective, but maintains that in a milieu of free critical discussion, possible only in an open society, subjectivity, where it is dangerous, may be largely neutralized. The social and institutional prerequisites of science are stressed-science too must be an open society-but the deterministic doctrine, proposed by Mannheim, and once again undeservedly popular, that scientific theories are no more than social products, is rejected. There is the intriguing conjecture, added in (9) to note 9 of chapter 6, that the approximate identity /2 + I3 = n may have encouraged Plato to think that all irrational numbers are simple functions of x/2 and i3, and to have reinforced his view that the regular platonic solids (in which only these surds appear) hold the key to the understanding of nature. Still of relevance is an important, though brief, criticism of the ideal of a liberal education. Popper wrote (chapter 11, note 6): ...in our day no man should be considered educated if he does not take an interest in science. ... Anybody who does not attempt to acquire an understanding of this movement cuts himself off from the most remarkable development in the history of human affairs. ... [not only does] literary education ... fail to educate the student ... to an understanding of the greatest spiritual movement of his own day, but it also often fails to educate him to intellectual honesty. Only if the student experiences how easy it is to err, and how hard to make even a small advance in the field of knowledge, only then can he obtain a feeling for the standards of intellectual honesty, a respect for truth, and a disregard of authority and bumptiousness. Quoting T.H. Huxley's view that a liberal education, far from inculcating 'the power of seeing things as they are without regard to authority', does its best to suppress it, Popper went on: I admit that, unfortunately, this is true also of many courses in science, which by some teachers is still treated as if it was 'a body of knowledge', as the ancient phrase goes. But this idea will one day, I hope, disappear; for science can be taught as a fascinating part of human history-as a quickly developing growth of bold hypotheses, controlled by experiment, and by criticism. Taught in this way ... it could become the basis of a new liberal University education; of one whose aim, where it cannot produce experts, will be to produce at least men who can distinguish between a charlatan and an expert. It is a sad fact that these modest aims are even now very far from being achieved. The cult of the expert is flourishing, as is the cult of the charlatan. Few students of the humanities are taught to think of science as a stirring intellectual adventure, calling for both courage and humility. Science students usually fare even worse (Bondi 1992). The first volume of The open society was completed in October 1942, the second volume in February 1943. Each volume had been rewritten many times, and retyped by Hennie many times (Gombrich 1995). Finding a publisher was hardly less arduous. A copy entrusted to a friend in the USA languished on his desk unsubmitted. The view was that the book was too 379</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs disrespectful of Aristotle to be worth offering to a publisher. (Aristotle is a relatively minor character in the book. Popper was later to admit that he was unjustly treated.) Finally Popper made contact with Ernst Gombrich, whom he had known in London before leaving for New Zealand. Gombrich accepted the exacting commission to place the book and, with the assistance of F.A. von Hayek, secured the interest of Herbert Read at George Routledge &amp; Sons, though not before it had been rejected by Cambridge University Press for being too disrespectful of Plato. At more or less the same time Hayek, at whose seminar years before Popper had read an early version of The poverty of historicism, was manoeuvring to bring him to the London School of Economics (L.S.E.). The previous incumbent of the Chair of Logic and Scientific Method, shared half-time with University College, had retired in 1941 after 35 years' service (Dahrendorf 1995, pp. 205, 369). Hayek and Ginsberg were in agreement that teaching in these subjects must continue, but whereas Ginsberg thought the matter not urgent, Hayek had a candidate up his sleeve; the half-time chair, he proposed, should be converted into a full-time readership, to be held not by a bright young man but by a mature and experienced logician and philosopher [368.1]. Hayek prevailed. In the spring of 1944 Popper received a contract from Routledge for The open society (Gombrich 1995, p. 11; Simkin 1993, p. 187); 12 months later he was appointed to the readership at the L.S.E. The open society must have been one of Routledge's best investments, for the book has been through half a dozen editions, and has remained in print for 50 years. The L.S.E. did well too. The testimonial that Russell had written in 1936 hardly exaggerated in its description of Popper as 'a man of great ability, whom any university would be fortunate in having on its staff' [406.4]; the passage is quoted by Grattan-Guinness 1992, p. 5). The Poppers' life in New Zealand seems to have been an austere one, with little diversion from teaching and research. There was some mountaineering and skiing in the Southern Alps, and in 1938 or 1939, he reports in (14), appendix *x, they went digging for the bones of moas in the marshy land of Pyramid Valley, about 50 miles north-west of Christchurch. After the Anschluss they organized a committee to help Austrian refugees to obtain New Zealand entry visas. Out of his salary came repayments of a sizable mortgage loan on their wooden house on Cashmere Hill (where Popper seized the opportunity to deploy his woodworking skills), heavy premiums on a life insurance policy, and some help (via the Red Cross) for his sister Annie in Switzerland. Their main luxuries seem to have been ice creams and milkshakes. But austerity and simplicity were what the Social Democrats in Vienna had always prescribed and-departmental hostilities aside-it seems that the Poppers were contented. The writing of The open society evidently exhausted them. But even after the L.S.E. appointment had been confirmed, their problems in New Zealand were not quite over. Popper was reluctant to resign his position at Canterbury (in virtue of which they were permitted to live in New Zealand), since they were stateless and the British Government had granted visas for only 12 months. Much as they wanted to return to Europe, they could not throw away their right to live in a free country. But the worry was unnecessary. On 25 October 1945 he was granted leave of absence for the 1946 academic year, and on 1 November he and Hennie became naturalized British subjects [325.27]. (Citizenship had to wait until 1949.) He eventually resigned his New Zealand post on 18 June 1946 [366.4]. 380</page><page sequence="14">Karl Raimund Popper AT THE L.S.E., 1946-59 Popper arrived at the L.S.E. in January 1946, again to be in an institution with only one philosopher. (Not for long: J.O. Wisdom joined the Department in 1948.) Still, there were other philosophers nearby, and he was at once made welcome in London and beyond. For the first time for 10 years he was able to attend philosophical meetings and conferences; so much so that he was an invited symposiast at the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association (the annual get-together of British philosophers) in each of the years 1946, 1948, and 1953. But despite the great friendliness he was shown, and despite the great respect he had for the abilities of some of the philosophers he came to know [290.6], he found the professional atmosphere in Britain chillingly unrealistic. Here was a country that for six years had been fighting a bloody war for its life, and here were its leading philosophers fribbling over such questions as whether there are other minds, or whether a physical object continues to exist when no one is observing it. Only with Russell and a few others did he feel in sympathy, though he was dismayed by Russell's return in his Human knowledge (1948) to something like the inductivism of J.S. Mill. (Russell owned a copy of Logik der Forschung, but the pages were barely cut. See Grattan-Guinness 1992, p. 8.) Indeed Popper never came to terms with academic philosophy in Britain (or elsewhere). He wholeheartedly disliked the linguistic philosophy in vogue on his arrival in 1946, which continued to dominate discussions at least until the end of the 1960s, sometimes comparing philosophical preoccupation with the niceties of language to spectacle-cleaning-a necessary task, no doubt, but only incidental to what spectacles are for (21, p. 138). Gellner's shocker Words and things (1959) was 'right on almost every point' [386.15]. Problems, Popper maintained, cannot be solved by language analysis, 'problems can only be solved with the help of new ideas' (23, ?7). Still less had he any respect for the frivolous reincarnations of Marxism that have constituted much of the philosophical chic of the last 30 years (though he had considerable sympathy for the seriousness of Marxism itself). Always pugnaciously out of fashion, he followed Kraft (1957; see 15, p. 11) in quoting with approval from von Hofmannsthal: 'Philosophy must be a judge of her times: things are in a bad way when she becomes an expression of the spirit of her times' (17; 43, p. 159). In New Zealand there had been no other professional philosophers within 200 miles of Christchurch and Popper had made his friends largely outside philosophical circles. Although it would be wrong to suggest that he did not keep on decently cordial terms, at least for some years, with his British colleagues in philosophy, this predilection was to persist for the rest of his life. He had few philosophical friends, apart from his own students. As in Vienna before the war, he had a reputation for being dazzlingly clever, but prickly and difficult to argue with. He was certainly difficult to get the better of, but this is attributable as much to his preparedness-he had usually already considered, and found a way of answering, his critics' objections-as to his combativeness. When something he had not thought of came along, he was all ears (an expression used, in a moment of perhaps unconscious self-mockery, in the fourth speech in chapter 14 of (16)). Among his new acquaintances in Britain, Peter Medawar, whom he met at Woodger's Theoretical Biology Club early in 1946 (33), was of special and almost immediate importance. They soon became friends, and exerted a powerful and positive mutual influence, each excited by and interested in the other's ideas and problems; for example, we find Medawar in June 1947 inviting Popper to come to Oxford to talk to his group about Godel's theorem, Zeno's paradoxes and quantification theory, quite a strenuous programme for a single evening 381</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs [325.25]. They were both members of the Metalogical Society, which met monthly under the auspices of A.J. Ayer between 1949 and 1953 (Crawshay-Williams 1970, p. 60). Medawar has documented in numerous places (1967, 1986, and elsewhere) his debt to Popper, whose methodological recommendations he embraced as warmly, and put into practice as thoroughly, as had Eccles; and when he was elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society in March 1949 he wrote [325.26] to acknowledge his indebtedness, saying that Popper deserved a 'cut' of the Fellowship. (In October 1960 he again awarded Popper a portion of the credit for his share of the Nobel Prize [325.25].) This cut was eventually paid with what must have been outstanding interest. Initially Popper had much less teaching to do than he had had in New Zealand-only #390 Logic (Sessional) and #391 Scientific method (Lent &amp; Summer) are advertised in the 1945-46 L.S.E. Prospectus [389.6]-but by the end of 1947 he was ruefully reporting eight hours of lectures weekly [282.24]. The heady phenomenon of Canterbury was repeated throughout the L.S.E. years. Lecturing with a minimum of notes, Popper attracted large audiences, composed of as many colleagues and visitors as undergraduates and research students. He followed no syllabus, and spoke usually on some topic that held his current interest. Students in Scientific method with no training in physics were more than once treated to an attack on the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. His celebrated seminar, in which friends and foes exposed their ideas to his incessant fire, was not an experience for the faint-hearted, and many found it overbearing and oppressive. Fools were suffered, not always gladly, but not upstarts and braggarts. A clear problem, and a provocative thesis stated in simple terms without jargon or technicality, were what every speaker was advised to bring along. But there was no telling from which direction criticism would come. All that was guaranteed was that it would come soon. In 1947-48 Popper published seven papers on logic, the fruits of intense work done in isolation in New Zealand. In these papers, in which he largely rediscovered the systems of natural deduction of Gentzen, he hoped to solve a problem left open in Tarski's discussion of logical consequence (1936, p. 420), namely that of clarifying the distinction between logical constants (such as not and all) and extra-logical constants (such as bat and ball); and thereby to show that the validity of the rules of logic can be reduced to definitions (6). There are errors in the second part of the project, as reviewers were quick to point out; but the papers 'contain a detailed and well-founded proposal' (Schroeder-Heister 1984, p. 80) to characterize the logical constants. It seems that Tarski, whose judgement Popper revered, was not much interested in this work when it was shown to him, and this response, as much as the mistakes he had made (Popper was always very sensitive to mistakes that he had not caught himself), discouraged further efforts. The open society and other works were successfully presented to the University of London in 1948 as a thesis for the degree of D.Lit. His entitlement to a professorship had by then been occupying Popper's mind for some time (Medawar 1986, pp. 113-115), but the bittiness of its curriculum in logic and scientific method at that time made it hard for the L.S.E. to make a case to the University for the establishment, or re-establishment, of a chair. Had Hennie's mother, who was still in Austria, not become seriously ill, the Poppers might well have been persuaded to return permanently to New Zealand, to the vacant chair at Otago to which Eccles energetically tried to lure him [290.7]. (The only occasion on which they did go back to New Zealand was in 1973, as visitors to the Universities of Otago and Canterbury.) The problem was eventually resolved by Popper's promotion to a personal professorship on 1 January 382</page><page sequence="16">Karl Raimund Popper 1949. Later that month there arrived an unexpected letter from Professor Donald Williams, Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Harvard, asking if Popper 'would entertain an invitation to give the William James Lectures' in the year 1949-50 [304.25]. Popper says that he 'thought a mistake had been made' (23, ?28), and that he had been confused with Josef Popper-Lynkeus, a distinguished philosopher and social theorist, also from Kolin, who had belonged to the Monists, the circle of Mach and Ostwald. But this is scarcely believable; on the one hand, Popper-Lynkeus had died nearly 30 years before; on the other, Williams's first letter mentions The open society by name. A fee of $6000 was offered for eight or ten weekly lectures, together with a parallel seminar course. The lectures-under the title 'The study of nature and of society'-were duly given, apparently from notes. The seminars were on 'The structure of experience' (a somewhat uncharacteristic title). Although one of the conditions of the lecture series, not mentioned by Harvard until it was too late, was that the lecturer deposit a manuscript copy of his lectures in the University Library, Popper never complied, and never produced the obligatory work for publication. Yet he was hardly taking things easy. The 1950s was an extraordinarily productive decade. Conjectures and refutations (16) collects a number of striking papers from these years on diverse problems in the philosophy of science, on logic, on the body-mind problem, on metaphysics, on problems of social philosophy, and on the pre-Socratic philosophers. One of these papers (chapter 6) shows to what extent Mach's criticisms of absolute space, time and motion were anticipated by Berkeley in De motu (1721). Popper distanced himself from the instrumentalist tenor of these criticisms, and also from the essentialism-in Cotes's explanation of gravity, for example-against which they were aimed; and argued (chapter 3) for an intermediate view of science, as the search for ever deeper, but never ultimate, explanations. Beginning with (10), there were seven notes in five years skirmishing with Camap and Bar-Hillel over the inductivist identification of probability and degree of corroboration. In their joint paper (Bar-Hillel &amp; Camap 1954) these authors managed to embrace Popper's doctrine of the inverse relation of probability and content, but separately they resisted the conclusion that empirical investigation is not directed at making our theories more probable. In (12) was initiated a series of notes, mostly in Nature, on the arrow of time and the correct interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, topics on which he had some altercations with Schrodinger. At Hennie's insistence-she had to cry all night before he was persuaded-Popper also undertook (with help from others) an English translation of (1), a project that had been set in motion as far back as 1937 but soon halted for lack of financial support (Godsiff 1972; Woodger completed a translation too in 1946 [12.13], but it was never used). Although the outcome, The logic of scientific discovery (14), contained much extra material, packed into new footnotes and new appendices, even more was left out. As the translation proceeded it became clear that the fruits of 20 years' thinking, especially on the interpretation of probability and related issues, would comfortably fill another book; and accordingly another book was conceived and composed, under the title Postscript: after twenty years. Projected for 1954, it was more or less in shape by the end of 1957. But for various reasons, including undue perfectionism and serious illness, the correction of the proofs of this companion volume was still unfinished in 1962, when it was set aside for what was to be a second 20 years. It was eventually published as a three-volume work, containing a second bounty of new material in an unwieldy agglutination of prefaces, introductions, and addenda, as (29-31). Popper travelled widely. Encouraged by Hayek, he began as early as 1948 to attend and 383</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs contribute to meetings of The Austrian College Society in Alpbach (Tyrol), a group set up largely by former members of the Resistance to nurture democratic values in post-war Austria. He was invited to spend the 1956-57 academic year at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. This visit was nearly scotched by Popper's guileless application to the US consulate for a visa; having originally written of some of the friends of his youth that they 'later became Communists', he then declared that what he had wanted to say was that they 'called themselves Communists'. He was told at once that this association would have to be referred to Washington, and that meanwhile he could do no better than collect up to 20 declarations by prominent and solid citizens that he was not a communist. His friends obliged, writing letters resonant with disbelief that the US Government could imagine that the author of The open society was sympathetic to communism [407.23]. It was only intervention by a retired senior diplomat that put an end to a time-wasting investigation. It is hardly possible to do justice to the wealth of arrestingly novel ideas that Popper brought to fruition between 1950 and 1959 (he continued to work on many of them for many years more). The principal contributions of The postscript will be described in the next section. Before that it is necessary to say something about his remarkable 'autonomous' axiomatizations of the elementary theory of probability. Popper had published his first (rather clumsy) axiomatization of probability theory as far back as 1938 (2). Nothing more was published until 1955 (11), but in the meantime his thinking on the subject took a most unexpected turn. Originally, knowing nothing of the Kolmogorov axiomatization of 1933, now nearly canonical, he had been concerned only to provide an abstract axiomatization for the singulary function p(y). (In terms of this function the conditional probability p(x I z) is standardly defined as the quotient p(xz)lp(z), for positive p(z); here concatenation stands for meet or conjunction.) Later, fortuitously misled by the fact that in the propensity interpretation (to be discussed below) probabilities are always relative to the ambient physical conditions, he decided to adopt the binary functor p(x I z) as primitive. Call x and z [probabilistically] indistinguishable if for all y the probabilities p(x I y) and p(z I y) are equal; in symbols, x - z. At some stage Popper noticed that, granted (xz)y - (xy)(zy), we can easily derive the distribution property (x v z)y - xy v zy (here v stands for join or disjunction) from the general addition and multiplication laws p(x I y) + p(z I y) = p(xz I y) + p(x Vz I y), p(xz I y) = p(x I zy)p(z I y). (This derivation is the nub of one of the criticisms in (19) of the thesis of Birkhoff and von Neumann that quantum mechanics, which is undoubtedly in some sense a probabilistic theory, requires a non-distributive logic.) Now the identity of the terms (xz)y and (xy)(zy) follows from the familiar lattice laws of idempotence (yy = y), commutation (xz = zx), and association (x(yz) = (xy)z) for meet. Popper had worked in New Zealand on the axiomatization of Boolean algebra (and on Boole [4.12]), and seems to have been carried away with the thought that suitable axioms for the functor p might make it possible to establish the indistinguishability of these terms too, and hence the probabilistic distributive law p((x v z)y I w) } = p(xy v zy I w). So it proved. One of the many elegant axiom systems that accomplishes this task is this one (40, appendix *V): 384</page><page sequence="18">Karl Raimund Poppe Al 3x3zp(x x) x p(x z) A2 Vy[p(y y) &lt; p(x I ) &lt; p(z x)] K V(y (y | x) &lt; p(y I z)] A3 p( I x) p(z Iz) B1 p(xz I y) p(x y) B2 p(xz I y) = p(x zy)p(z y) C p( I x) 7 p(y I z) = p(x I x) = p(x I z) + p(x z) The accent in axiom C stands for a singulary operation that turns out to have all the properties of complementation. The sign v for join is introduced by the definition: x v z = (x'z')'. There are, as in all Popper's axiomatic systems for conditional probability, some unusual features. In the first place, p(x I z) is defined for every z, even the contradictory element yy'; in fact, p(x I yy') = 1. Secondly, the customary bounds on the function p do not appear explicitly; 0 &lt; p(x I z) &lt; 1 is a theorem. Most importantly, no assumption is made concerning the domain of elements x, y, z, ..., neither that it is a Boolean algebra, nor even that it is a lattice; none of the defining identities for meet is assumed for the concatenation operation, and no defining identity for the complement is assumed for '. It is this freedom from any purely algebraic assumptions that the description 'autonomous' is meant to mark. Nonetheless, the domain is reducible to a Boolean algebra, in the sense that s = t is an identity of Boolean algebra if and only if the probabilistic indistinguishability of s and t is derivable in the system. This establishes a result that previously had been no more than a rumour: namely, that the theory of probability is a genuine generalization of classical propositional logic, not merely an extension of it (in the way that, as here formulated, it is merely an extension of some theory of the real numbers). Indeed the deducibility relation z I x is definable in many ways; for instance, by the relation z - xz, or by the identity p(x 1- zx') = 1. An axiomatic system different only in minor respects from the one above was spelt out in detail, and weighed with numerous alternatives, in two of the new appendices, *iv and *v, of (14). Popper ventured there the opinion that it 'can hardly be further simplified' (14, appendix *ii, note *i), but he never stopped working on refinements, improvements and variations to it. Some of the crucial proofs in his original presentation were indeed decisively simplified in (42). Leblanc (1989) is a survey and comparison with other work, including the contemporary axiomatizations published by Renyi (1955), which also take as primitive the conditional probability functor. Although Popper's systems are plainly a contribution more to abstract algebra than to philosophy, they are a splendid philosophical achievement too, revealing close and subtle connections between logic and probability theory. Popper explained his embarking on such a technical exercise on the grounds that only if the definitive properties of probability are established can we hope to evaluate the inductivist thesis that the conditional probability p(h I e) of a hypothesis h on evidence e is identical with its degree of corroboration. It is questionable whether his underlying aim-to crush that thesis-has been achieved. In any case it is odd that when introducing the end-products of his long investigation Popper should have disparaged them as 'somewhat technical-too much so for my taste, at least' (14, proem to new appendices), since the zest with which he worked on them, and the quite proper pride he took in them, were well known. He always rightly objected to the cult of precision for its own sake, but these beautiful axiomatic systems are not an instance of precision for its own sake. 385</page><page sequence="19">Biographical Memoirs In the early 1950s the Poppers had bought Fallowfield, the house in Penn (Buckinghamshire) that they were to live in for 35 years. (Previously they had lived in East Baret [293.7].) On the outskirts of London, only just within the 30-mile radius ordained by the University of London (Bartley 1982, p. 254), barely accessible by public transport, Penn was still a village, Fallowfield a relatively small house set in a large garden in a private road. So began a process of withdrawal from metropolitan life that, by the end of the decade, was almost eremetic. Never comfortable in smoke-filled rooms, Popper attended committee and board meetings at the L.S.E. as seldom as he could. New recruits to the Department, Joseph Agassi in 1957, J.W.N. Watkins (who transferred from the Department of Government) in 1958, W.W. Bartley III and Imre Lakatos in 1960, when Agassi departed, and Alan Musgrave in 1964, helped markedly to reduce his teaching load (in some years it was no more than one lecture and one seminar each week). He was relieved of much of the administrative burden too, largely by Agassi and Watkins. From the early 1950s until the early 1980s, the Nuffield Foundation and others supported Popper's employment of a research assistant, a singular luxury for a philosopher, and one of the main tasks of the assistant, in daily contact by telephone, was to procure books and periodicals; this was often a considerable task, since Popper's interests in natural science were only exiguously served by the British Library of Political &amp; Economic Science (indeed in one year the assistant was the source of 50% of the Library's requests to the Inter-Library Loan Service). Popper was often able to restrict his attendance at the L.S.E. to one day each week. With the publication of The logic of scientific discovery (14), Logik der Forschung was available in English translation. The postscript was planned to follow, as soon as the proofs could be amended to incorporate the extensive suggestions of a new critic who had arrived at the L.S.E. in 1958, W.W. Bartley. But Popper's health-always a worry to him-took a serious downward turn in 1960 when his eyesight started to fail. Anxiously returning to Vienna, he had operations on both eyes for detached retinas. The operations were successful, but work on the proofs of The postscript was pushed aside, and by 1962 abandoned. The revised typescript was retyped in 1969, but again put aside. Several parts were extracted and published independently; and by the time that the book was published in full in the early 1980s it had become almost a historical document. It is appropriate to turn to its contents here, and to resume in the following section the story of Popper's career at the L.S.E. No deep significance attaches to the year 1960 as the moment of division. THE POSTSCRIPT The unifying theme of the original unsupplemented Postscript is the propensity interpretation of probability, with which Popper proposed to overcome some outstanding problems faced by the frequency interpretation and, above all, to resolve the main paradoxes of quantum theory. The new interpretation is underwritten by metaphysical indeterminism, the doctrine that the cosmos is ineradicably infected with an element of chance. But it holds that chance is more than mere chance: chance events are not rank accidents, unintelligible deposals of causality; they are outcomes partly controlled by the physical situations from which they emanate. It is unfortunate that the key section introducing the propensity interpretation, 'The case for propensities' 31, Part II, ?20, signally fails to do justice to its originality; elsewhere in The postscript too Popper tends to represent it as simply an adjustment to or correction of the 386</page><page sequence="20">Karl Raimund Popper frequency interpretation (which, for want of any other, physicists, such as von Neumann 1936, Chapter IV. 1, often settle for). But, right or wrong, the propensity interpretation is a radical addition to our understanding of physical probability, the crucial improvement being the authentication of single-case probabilities. According to the frequency interpretation, a single outcome may be ascribed a probability only if it is glossed as a member of a collective; for example, the probability that an individual particle is transmitted at a barrier makes sense only if the particle is assigned to some ensemble of particles. Since the frequency of transmission may be different in different ensembles, there is no unique collective and there is no unambiguous single-case probability. We might suggest that the true probability of an outcome is its frequency in the most tightly defined collective containing it, but this collapses all single-case probabilities to 0 or 1, a result agreeable only to determinists. There is to be sure a subjectivist angle, which understands the probability of the outcome of a single trial to be its frequency in the most tightly defined collective to which, prior to the trial, it was known to belong. On this view, it is appropriate to talk of probability only because we do not know enough. This position must in turn be distinguished carefully from the subjectivist position with regard to chance that Popper, anxious to avoid metaphysical speculation, fell back on in (1, ?69). It was one of the theses of ?62 of that book, much elaborated in ??3-6 of (30), that we resort to probability not as a relief from ignorance but because that is what the problem situation demands: statistical questions-such as those concerning the intensity of spectral lines-demand probabilistic or statistical answers. An inability to make adequate sense of single-case probabilities is an inevitable consequence of combining an objectivist approach to probability with a subjectivist construe of chance. The postscript renounced the latter, and set out to provide a theory of objective single-case probabilities. For once we acknowledge indeterminism, which implies that the present state of the world can in principle evolve into different possible future states, we shall want to allow that these different possibilities are not necessarily equal; and if we are persevering, and willing to dig behind the appearances, we may want also to attribute these inequalities to some feature of the present state of the world. What Popper suggests is that the present state is endowed with propensities, active forces whose resultant is indeterminate; and it is the strength of the propensity of a particular outcome that we have in mind when we ascribe to it a single-case probability. As each particle in a stream arrives at a barrier, for example, there is a propensity of transmission (as well as propensities of reflection and absorption); and hence a unique probability of transmission that is independent of other particles (though if they are similar particles, the probability may be the same). We cannot measure directly the propensity of a single outcome, since it either happens or does not happen; single-case probabilities may therefore properly be called metaphysical. Constant propensities may indeed be measured more or less accurately by frequencies, but this does not mean a return to or a variant of the frequency interpretation. What the propensity interpretation does, in brief, is bring to life the uninterpreted term 'P' ('probability') in the usual measure-theoretic formalism. The publication of extracts from The postscript many years before the book itself appeared has led to a widespread acceptance of Popper's innovation in one form or another. Yet there are two particularly common misunderstandings needing correction, both stemming from a naive assimilation of propensities to those dispositional properties (such as mass or conductivity) that are usually attributed to material bodies. First, propensities do not reside in individual things; they are 'objective physical properties of the physical situation under consideration and, ultimately, of the whole physical world' (30, Introduction, ?4). Secondly, the 387</page><page sequence="21">Biographical Memoirs fundamental propensities are not propensities to produce frequencies. The propensity interpretation, unlike the frequency interpretation, is not restricted to repeatable effects or experiments (30, Introduction, ?3, note 63). Even what counts as a repetition of an experiment is different: propensity theorists treat two situations as similar because, they conjecture, they have the same probability (propensity) distribution; for frequentists it is the other way round. The propensity interpretation would be invalidated if the universe could be shown to be deterministic; invalidated, that is, as an interpretation of probabilities other than 0 and 1. One of the principal tasks of The postscript was to demonstrate that the debate between determinism and indeterminism, though inescapably metaphysical, is amenable to rational discussion. Logik der Forschung had tried hard to steer clear of metaphysics (see 14, ?69, note *2), and declined to endorse the fashionable indeterminism of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Unpredictability of some phenomena was admitted-indeed, as noted below, this was the substance of Popper's interpretation of the uncertainty formulas as scatter relations-but it was argued that this spoke neither for nor against indeterminism (?78). In other words, Popper held open the door to a deterministic interpretation of chance phenomena in terms of hidden variables. But since the matter was not empirically decidable either way, he regarded it as out of bounds; not meaningless, but best left undiscussed. By the time of the writing of The postscript this wariness of metaphysics had been allayed, and the empiricist leanings of falsificationism generalized to a critical rationalism (4, chapter 24) that was prepared to entertain any hypothesis that could be criticized (whether or not the criticism made appeal to empirical evidence). Given the affinity between determinism and historicism, it is not very surprising that Popper should have been won over to indeterminism. In (4), chapter 13, and in arguments with Einstein at Princeton in 1950, he had described indeterminism ('free will', if you like) as the position of common sense, and by no means 'a necessary pre- requisite of a science which can make predictions'. In The open universe (29) he maintained that the only arguments against it are those (Laplace's demon) that extrapolate from the predictive success of science, especially classical physics; and that to expose determinism as an unsupported dogma in conflict with common sense, it is therefore enough to show that there are limits to what science can predict. He presented three main arguments, none of them alluding to the interpretation of the uncertainty formulas as scatter relations. One, a familiar one today, appeals to the existence of unstable dynamical systems (?14); relying heavily on a prescient discussion by Duhem (1906, Part II, chapter III, ?3), Popper cited a result of Hadamard (1898) that shows that on certain surfaces of negative curvature qualitatively different trajectories may depart from starting points that are arbitrarily close together. The second argument, more original and still not well understood, attacks the possibility of prediction from within, the possibility, that is, that a predicting device predicts correctly its own future activity (?22; and also 7, 8); there are connections here with the phenomena of self-fulfilling (and self-frustrating) predictions, discussed briefly in (13, ??5f). A third argument appeals to special relativity; to the possibility that events outside the light cone, and therefore unknowable, at the time at which a prediction is made, may be within the light cone, and causally efficacious, at the time for which the prediction is made (? 19). None of these arguments is sufficient to eliminate determinism, since the closedness of the future is, as Popper well knew, compatible with our not being able to predict the future. He therefore offered a variety of more intuitive arguments, as well as an argument, due to Lande (1955), specifically designed to undo the possibility of deterministic hidden variables (?29). This argument assumes a favourite thesis of Popper's, that a statistical conclusion always requires 388</page><page sequence="22">Karl Raimund Popper statistical premises; a thesis that is rendered doubtful, if not contradicted, by the pseudo- random evolutions of some non-linear dynamical processes. The subjectivist alternative, that a statistical conclusion always derives from a supposition of nescience, was the main target of Quantum theory and the schism in physics (30), the third volume of The postscript. Popper vehemently contested the infiltration of this subjectivism into statistical mechanics, where it had produced pronouncements such as that of Pauli: 'the entropy of a system ... depends upon our knowledge of the system. ... If this knowledge of ours is maximal ... then the entropy is always zero' (1954, pp. 114f., quoted in ?5 of (30)). Against this view that, in an ideal state of knowledge, the statistics would wither away, Popper wrote that 'it is clearly absurd to believe that pennies fall or molecules collide in a random fashion because we do not know the initial conditions' (?3). The attack on subjectivism was continued into quantum theory, whose outstanding riddles, Popper argued, sprang from two mistakes: the positivist dismissal of what is hidden, and the attempt to graft Born's statistical interpretation on to an underlying determinism. With the help of the propensity interpretation of probability he proposed to extend the realist discussion of (1), where it had been argued that the uncertainty relations, for instance Ax.Apj &gt; h/4rc, set absolute limits not to the precise states of individual particles, but to the statistical homogeneity of ensembles that we can prepare. The uncertainty relations say nothing about what can be measured, let alone about what is truly the case, but only about what can be predicted. It is now recognized that Popper was here at least on the right track; the unpredictability, beyond a certain level of precision, of both the position and momentum of a particle does not preclude the possibility that more precise values of these quantities might be calculated from the results of later measurements. The uncertainty relations do not imply that precise positions and momenta can never be known-let alone, as the positivism of the Copenhagen interpretation pretends, that to talk about a particle's path is to talk nonsense- only that there are details that we cannot know in advance. The propensity interpretation makes good sense here; indeed, the uncertainty relations can be understood as stating conditions on the propensity that a particle will take up a certain momentum (position), given that it is forced into a certain position (momentum). But the new outlook enables us, Popper suggested, also to deal with such conundrums as the two-slit experiment (?18). The secret is simply that propensities are a feature of 'the physical situation under consideration and, ultimately, of the whole physical world' (already quoted). A screen with one slit open evokes a different propensity distribution from a screen with two slits open. That the distribution may change instantaneously or 'with superluminal velocity' when a slit is opened or closed is not a mysterious quantum effect, but a trite fact of probability theory. (Why it changes in the way that it does is indeed something for quantum theory to explain.) A pinboard provides a simple classical example of exactly the same kind of effect (theses 8 and 9 of (18), included as Introduction to (30)). This is in general all that there is to the 'reduction of the wave packet' (1, ?76; 30, ??8, 23). Of course, the instantaneous character of the change is problematic for those who interpret probability subjectivistically; for probability on this interpretation should change only with a change of subjective information, which would therefore have to be transmitted with superluminal velocity. In (1), ?77, Popper had hoped to seal his criticism of Heisenberg's interpretation of the 389</page><page sequence="23">Biographical Memoirs uncertainty relations with a thought experiment demonstrating its inconsistency with the quantum-mechanical formalism. Although this experiment was vitiated by an error, it may have influenced the thinking that led to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment of 1935 (Jammer 1974, pp. 174-178; (30), Preface, ?V, note 20). The EPR experiment itself argues that instantaneous action at a distance is a consequence of any interpretation of the formalism that denies that particles possess sharp positions and momenta simultaneously. But later experiments, such as those suggested by Bohm, and those actually performed by Aspect, indicate that there may exist genuine infringements of the principle of locality. Popper's response to these later developments was to concede that action at a distance may have to be accepted in modem physics (as it was accepted in classical physics). Aspect's experiment, he declared, would then be 'the first crucial experiment between Lorentz's and Einstein's interpretations of the Lorentz transformations' (Author's note to (30)). For many years Popper was almost alone in his fight against what he saw as a stifling orthodoxy dominating quantum theory, though he remained heartened that Einstein and de Broglie were among the doubters. He was greatly delighted at the publication of Ballentine (1970) in Reviews of Modern Physics. He fought not only against the intrusion of 'the observer' into objective science, but also against the supposed revelation that quantum mechanics had brought at least one area of physics to completion. Not only was he convinced that this was based on a misinterpretation of the quantum formalism; he resisted it as wilfully obscurantist and, if taken seriously, in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The inspiring message with which (1) had ended was that science is a permanently unfinished enterprise, and that the opportunity of making revolutionary new discoveries must not be compromised. This 'persistent and recklessly critical quest for truth' (?85) he never abandoned. Although The postscript is, as noted, largely a treatise on the philosophy of physical science, tied together by the propensity interpretation of probability, the first volume Realism and the aim of science (31) contains nearly 300 pages of renewed discussion of the problems of induction and demarcation, a defence of realism and a criticism of instrumentalism, and a further offensive against the idea that degree of corroboration can be identified with probability. Here it is possible to mention only two highlights: an important argument against the possibility of inductive logic, which takes notice of the fact that new theories in physics characteristically contradict the evidence on which they are supposed to be based; and a witty criticism of the positivist doctrine that the division between science and non-science is a division between what can and what cannot be said. The former point can be quickly summarized: according to Newton's theory, for example, the elliptical orbits postulated by Kepler's laws are perturbed by interplanetary forces. Yet Kepler's laws offer no hint of what adjustments are needed to proceed to the more general theory. As Whewell (1860, p. 509) had said: 'Newton's proof that this [the elliptical orbit] was the result of a central force ... was the solution of a problem at which his contemporaries had laboured in vain.' Duhem too noted that the process involved is in no sense logical (1906, Part II, chapter VI, ?4); it is the invention of a deeper hypothesis. Popper went on to suggest that we may regard the correction of its predecessor (or of the evidence) by a new theory as a sufficient condition for an increase in depth (? 15). In contrast to the craven shallowness of positivism and instrumentalism, realism encourages us to penetrate more and more deeply into the constitution of the universe. If the signature tune of the Vienna Circle was based on Waismann's theme that 'the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification' (and hence metaphysics is 390</page><page sequence="24">Karl Raimund Popper meaningless), its most ambitious orchestration was due to Carnap who, following Wittgenstein, proposed the thesis that in an ideal language ('the language of science') only verifiable scientific statements would be capable of formulation, and what pretended to be metaphysical statements would be exposed as pseudo-statements, ungrammatical noises. In its primitive form this idea was destroyed by the recognition (for which Popper deserves much credit, even though it goes back to Hume) that scientific hypotheses, being spatiotemporally universal, are never verifiable by experience. But the meaninglessness of metaphysics was soon to be identified by Carnap with its untestability, and the dogma of the language of science dressed in a new costume. Popper's side of this story is painstakingly told in a paper written around this time (16, Chapter 11). The discussion in (31) of what Popper called 'the changing philosophy of sense and nonsense' contains at least one gem (?24). To establish that belonging to science has little to do with belonging to a scientific language, and that testability has little to do with logical form, Popper showed that two of the most famous unresolved conjectures of elementary number theory can be expressed in almost the same vocabulary, and cast in exactly the same logical form, yet one is falsifiable by inspection of finitely many positive integers and the other (according to present knowledge) is unfalsifiable. We may formulate the two conjectures in this way (the range of the variables is the set of positive integers). (1) Vx3z[prime(x + z) A prime((x + 2)- z))], (2) Vx3z[prime(x + z) A prine((x + 2) + z))]. Popper notes that if Goldbach's conjecture (eqn 1 above) is a grammatically correct expression in a meaningful language, then so is the twin prime conjecture (eqn 2 above). But whereas the former, if false, is finitely falsifiable, the latter is not. Testability is not to be identified with meaningfulness. Indeed, it had long been Popper's view that although some metaphysics is of dubious merit, in general it is not meaningless, and may even be an essential component of science. Atomism was the example usually given of a metaphysical theory that gradually became testable and scientific (1, ?4). The postscript itself found metaphysical research programmes to be ubiquitous, and suggested that most scientific activity, from the selection of problems to the endorsement of solutions, takes place under the guidance of some programme or another. In its concluding chapter, 'A metaphysical epilogue', Popper listed 10 programmes, from the static world of Parmenides to the statistical world of Born, that had coloured the development of the theory of matter, and offered a particularly useful brief history of the change in the metaphysical problem situation from Descartes to Faraday (30, ?20). A vision of the world in terms of fields of propensities was proposed as a new research programme that would solve many of the existing problems of the interpretation of physical theories. The idea is further developed in (36). It is hard to assess what the impact of The postscript might have been had it been published 25 years earlier. Some of its central theses-that there are limits to predictability even in classical physics, that the Copenhagen interpretation is not the last word in microphysics, that scientific theories have to be falsifiable, that science is shot through with metaphysics-are among today's commonplaces. This was hardly true in the mid-1950s, when the book was written. But there is one stark exception: the thesis that induction is sheer sophistry has yet to become a commonplace, even among those whose work, in Popper's view, best illustrates what sophistry induction is. 391</page><page sequence="25">Biographical Memoirs AT THE L.S.E., 1960-69 For many years Fallowfield was the site of an intellectual cottage industry. In his study, overlooking the lawn, Popper wrote always in longhand, producing complex coiling pages crammed with corrections and recorrections, cancellations and insertions. Hennie gave everything written her incisive critical attention, then typed it with four or five carbon copies, ready for the next round of revisions. When there was time, she worked in the garden, but much of her day was spent in what was called the bookroom, trying to control the ceaseless flow of paper from the external world. Few items were ever discarded, but there was not even a filing cabinet to organize the heaps of folders and envelopes precariously stacked on shelves. In later years Popper also had a secretary at the L.S.E., who played a crucial role in the production of the final typescripts. Through the research assistant's hands passed each version of each piece of philosophical writing, and comments and suggestions for improvements were encouraged and introduced at all levels and at all stages. In effect the assistant became an apprentice, except for Hennie the most influential and active partner in the business (Agassi 1993, chapter 4). In what spare time he had, Popper enjoyed reading the novels of Austen and Trollope-for which he had an almost photographic memory-but in truth there was little time allowed for relaxation at Penn. On normal days even meals were distractions; Hennie did not much like to cook, and visitors usually had to make do with sandwiches or biscuits, instant coffee or tea. Popper himself never touched alcohol-sometimes mentioning the degradation that he had witnessed in Vienna in his youth-and it was rarely offered. But visitors (not colleagues or assistants) could on occasion be served a glass of decidedly good sherry, in which Hennie would join. She was much happier entertaining at home than going out, and as Popper's aversion to smoke increased, not to mention his difficulties in hearing what was said if there was background conversation, they stayed more and more at Penn, always graciously receiving visitors but paying few return calls. Yet for all the mass of work being done, there was little pressure. Bondi has spoken of 'the purely intellectual atmosphere in which non-intellectual thoughts or actions had no place whatsoever ... exemplified there with clarity, beauty and kindness' (1995, p. 7). In summer many pleasant afternoons would be spent working at the table on the terrace, or sauntering round the fallow field, a large grassy plot adjoining the garden, listening-and intermittently intervening-as Popper tried out new ideas. Popper was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1958. In the Academy's Annual Philosophical Lecture in January 1960 (16, Introduction) he explicitly compared the epistemological question 'How do you know?' with the political question 'Who should rule?', maintaining that each was responsible for untold authoritarian mischief. The political question, it had been argued in chapter 7 of The open society, is potentially paradoxical, and must be replaced by the more sensible question 'How can we organize political institutions so that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?' Similarly, the sensible answer to the question 'How do you know?' is 'I do not know. How can I improve my guess?'. The way in which hypotheses and evidence in science adjudicate hesitantly and flexibly on each other's worth is, he suggested, parallel to the way in which the government and the electorate in a liberal democracy exercise limited but genuine control on each other's actions. What political theorists call the theory of checks and balances, though fraught with danger, works surprisingly successfully in practice once the appropriate institutions are in place. It seems fair to conclude that science too should also be able to flourish without appeal to ultimate authorities. Anarchy [= scepticism] and tyranny [= dogmatism] do not exhaust the alternatives. 392</page><page sequence="26">Karl Raimund Popper Another important step, quite different in character, that was taken in 1960 was Popper's attempt to give a technical definition of the idea of 'verisimilitude' or 'closeness to the truth', an idea sharply to be distinguished from probability, which is a measure of closeness to certainty (see 16, chapter 10, ??xi-xiv). This attempt was-if the expression may be used- a splendid failure. For although Popper's own definition was shown in 1974 to be unsatisfactory, its refutation inspired much work by others, providing a timely illustration of the thesis that the way that our knowledge grows is through the invention of new hypotheses and their critical examination. The original problem here was that of explaining how progress is possible in science if so many scientific theories, even the most empirically successful ones-such as Kepler's laws or Newton's theory-are in time refuted. (The instrumentalist whitewash, which pleads that a refuted theory remains 'true within its field of application', is not countenanced by falsificationists.) Defining the truth content, Br and falsity content, B F of a theory B to be the sets of its true consequences and false consequences respectively, Popper proposed a seductively simple elucidation of the idea that C has greater verisimilitude than a rival A has (or is closer to the whole truth than A is). In brief, AT C Tand CF AF; that is, C must add to A's successes (or, at worst, not lose any), and lose some of its errors (or, at worst, not add any). It can be shown that the relation between false theories is, unfortunately, never as simple as this; indeed, the definition does not allow one false theory to be objectively closer to the truth than is a rival theory (true or false). Popper responded in different ways to the impact on his philosophy of this result and related negative results: (24) and (27), appendix 2, were puzzled but appreciative, (31), Introduction, ?V, more defiant. It is perhaps fair to say that, enchanted by a definition that he found 'very beautiful indeed' [294. 6], he had neglected to subject it to stringent criticism, and that, had he done so, he would quickly have discovered its unsatisfactoriness. A voluminous subsequent discussion has hardly resolved the matter, and the situation at present seems to be that although realists (those who believe in truth at all) are for the most part confident that it makes good sense to claim that one theory (say, general relativity) is objectively closer to the truth than is another (say, classical mechanics), and hence an instance of scientific progress, no one can give a logically watertight account of what such progress amounts to. A third advance at the beginning of the 1960s was into the philosophy of biology. Biological ideas lay behind many of Popper's early methodological proposals, for learning by trial and error is, as he had realized, a Darwinian process of selection by the environment, while induction-if it existed-would resemble a Lamarckian process of instruction. (Just as natural selection is often misread as the inheritance of acquired characteristics, so learning by trial and error is often misread as induction.) It is perhaps surprising that Darwin's theory, and biology generally, had until this point been mentioned so little in Popper's writings, the most weighty appearance having been the claim in (13), ?27, that evolutionary theory is a historical hypothesis, and that there can be no law of evolution; there is also an interesting reference in (28), ?S4, written in the early 1930s, to Jennings (1906). Darwin had been the subject of one of the portraits in his father's study (the other was of Schopenhauer), and he retained a fond memory of it; and among scientists biologists (Eccles, Medawar, Wachtershauser) have been notably vocal votaries of Popper's ideas. Doubtless it was his preoccupation with the logical analysis of the process of scientific discovery, rather than its description, that kept him so long from articulating what was later to be known as evolutionary epistemology. The similarity between falsificationism and Darwinism was brought to the fore in the 1961 Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford (22, chapter 7), where Popper talked freely of the 'natural selection of 393</page><page sequence="27">Biographical Memoirs hypotheses', insisting that the term was meant quite literally. Of course, there are differences between the growth of science and the evolution of life; he remarked, in particular, on the sharp contrast between the increasing differentiation typical of biological evolution and the increasing integration and unification typical of pure scientific knowledge. At this stage he had not developed the more subtle application of evolutionary categories to scientific knowledge that was evident, for example, in his second Spencer Lecture of 1973 (41, chapter 1); there science was no longer likened to a population of hypotheses struggling for survival but to a human organ, exosomatically developed and subject to unnatural (critical) selection. The crucial point, however, is the process, not the medium. Harking back to the psychology of the Wiirzburg school, Popper began to stress more and more the similarity of the problem- solving phases of learning and of biological development, eventually (22, chapter 6, ?xviii) condensed into the scheme P, -&gt; TS -&gt; EE - P (problem -&gt; tentative solution -&gt; error elimination -&gt; new problem(s)). In the 1961 lecture Popper also sought to make a contribution to evolutionary biology itself, by offering a hypothetical Darwinian explanation of orthogenesis; first by emphasizing (as Baldwin and Hardy had emphasized) that the preferences of an organism may, by remoulding its ecological niche, have a direct impact on evolutionary development (without, of course, having any impact on the genes)-this he called 'active Darwinism'-and secondly, more particularly, by proposing a model ('the spearhead theory') that makes it possible for a genotype to evolve in a seemingly goal-directed manner. The idea here is that each genotype incorporates more or less independently both preferences and ways of indulging those preferences; that the organism need not be imperilled if the former (the aim-structure) evolves without a corresponding evolution in the latter (the skill-structure); but that later mutations in the genetic basis of the skill-structure may enable it to catch up. Mutations that would almost certainly have been lethal may therefore turn out to be favourable if the ground (of aims and preferences) has already been prepared for them. A familiar example is the woodpecker's beak, whose successful establishment, the spearhead theory suggests, would have been the easier the more the bird had already cultivated a taste for the bugs living deep in the bark of trees. The spearhead theory has been examined in some detail, and applied to the body/mind problem, by Watkins (1995). Part of the motive for a substantial international congress in the philosophy of science that Lakatos, with much help from others, organized at Bedford College (London) in July 1965, was to bring Popper, recently knighted, face to face with two of his most prominent opponents in the USA One was Carnap, a friend and disputant since the time of Logik der Forschung, with whom he had been battling in the prints about inductive logic since the early 1950s; the other T.S. Kuhn, a historian of science who had attended Popper's seminars at Harvard in 1950 and had recently published a philosophical best-seller, The structure of scientific revolutions (1962). Although the tone of the public controversy between Popper and Carnap, and between their esquires, had often been bellicose, they liked and admired each other, and many considerate letters passed between them over the years. Popper wrote later in an obituary notice that Camap's 'influence was based on his great constructive powers and on the unique charm of his personality' (20). The confrontation between them at Bedford College was strangely artificial, and on induction they were as far apart as ever. Hardly more 394</page><page sequence="28">Karl Raimund Popper conciliatory was the session devoted to Kuhn's work. Kuhn repeated the celebrated contention (due originally to M. Polanyi 1958) that progress in science depends not, as Popper had always claimed, on imaginative new ideas subjected to harsh criticism, but on the suspension of criticism and its replacement by routine puzzle-solving under the auspices of what he called a paradigm; and suggested that the major developments, especially the revolutions, in the history of science, are understood better in socio-psychological than in rationalistic terms (1970). Popper's comments emphasized the oddity, when the understanding of the working of empirical science is at issue, of deferring to sociology and psychology, hardly the best developed of the empirical sciences. More significant for Popper at the congress were his Opening Address and a distressing dispute with Bartley, who had been one of his favourite pupils. This was not the first time, and not the last, that Popper and one of his followers were driven into painful and almost incomprehensible estrangement. In this instance the suspicion persists that the sharp tone of Bartley's paper, which Popper felt as an aggressive personal affront, was encouraged by a third party determined to make mischief. But in this instance, unlike others, the damage was eventually repaired. By 1980 Popper and Bartley were friends again, and Bartley undertook the considerable task of seeing The postscript through the press. The Opening Address, originally entitled 'Rationality and the search for invariants', returned to the question of metaphysical research programmes in physics, tracing the history and the dominance of the programme (which originated with the speculations of the pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides) of explaining change by concentrating on what does not change, of explaining change by explaining it away. Yet another work whose publication has been too long delayed, the infinitely revised lecture will be published in a forthcoming volume (46) on pre-Socratic thought. Popper's last major original philosophical venture, his 'three worlds philosophy', which he sometimes called 'the philosophy of my old age', started to take recognizable shape in 1965 in his Arthur Holly Compton Lecture at Washington University, St. Louis. Entitled 'Of clouds and clocks' (22, chapter 6), the lecture set out to contribute to our understanding of human freedom in a world that many regard as under the iron control of the laws of physics. Drawing again on material in The postscript (29)-Popper was an implacable cannibalizer-the lecture contemplated the nightmare of physical determinism, and firmly turned its back on it. Yet for genuine human freedom and creativity to exist, Popper stressed, it is not enough that our behaviour is not completely determined. To be free-though not, of course, completely-we must be able to control to some extent-though not, of course, completely-some aspects of the physical world. The physical world must be causally open to influences from outside, in particular psychological influences. These considerations simply reformulate the ancient problem of the interaction of body and mind ('Descartes's problem'). But Popper was alert to another problem, less often tackled, which he called 'Compton's problem', the problem of how abstract entities such as rules and decisions, theories and melodies, are able to bring about changes in the physical world. Materialists, who regard the world as essentially a world of matter (or, more generally, physics), formulate these problems as problems of reduction; the task, as they see it, is one of explaining how supposedly mental and abstract entities are to be construed as manifestations of matter alone. Popper had never cared for such views, or related ones such as behaviourism, if only because-though metaphysical in the highest degree-they appear to stem from a positivistic distaste for metaphysics rather than from any serious interest in the world. (For all that, of course, they may be interesting, and even true.) The Compton Lecture proposed that both problems may yield to the evolutionary hypothesis that the mind, 395</page><page sequence="29">Biographical Memoirs language and consciousness are components of a hierarchy of controls that has evolved (in such a way as had been proposed in (22), chapter 7) precisely because it allows the organism more freedom to pose and to evaluate competently solutions to the problems that it encounters. Popper reminded his audience that 50 years earlier his teacher Buhler had singled out disparate functions, hierarchically organized, of animal and human languages (to Biihler's expressive, signalling and descriptive functions Popper added others, especially the argumentative function). The controls are plastic, neither clockwork nor cloudage, resembling a soap bubble that both controls and is controlled by the air inside (in ?ii the similarity to the mechanism of checks and balances in a democratic state was fleetingly noted). Popper insisted that the higher control units, the mind, language, consciousness, though evolved from and embedded in a world of pure physics, are not themselves purely physical, any more than the problems that organisms struggle with are purely physical. From this it was a relatively short step to the picture of three distinct domains, the physical, the mental and the products of (human) mental activity, world 3 (22, chapter 3). World 3, Popper suggested, is created by minds (world 2), and acts on the physical world (world 1) only through the intervention of minds. But it is autonomous, in the sense that we may discover in it items that have not been consciously placed there; for example, new objective problems, and unseen consequences of previously invented theories. The principle of least action in classical mechanics, to take a simple example, was invented when Newton invented it, but discovered only when Maupertuis (or perhaps Euler) discovered it. The theory of three worlds has had many detractors, who have derided it as ontologically extravagant, mulish [= obstinate and barren], and even unphilosophical. Popper himself drew attention to some superficial similarities between world 3 and Plato's world of forms; but, as he noted, Plato's forms are eternal, unlike the human constructions that inhabit world 3. The similarity between world 3 and Hegel's Absolute Spirit, which he also mentioned, seems closer, though the evolution of world 3 is more of a hit-and-miss affair than the almost necessary advance that is supposed to characterize Absolute Spirit. As it happens, Popper's theory provides room for a much-needed synthesis-dialectical, if you must, but not Hegelian-of platonism and constructivism in the philosophy of mathematics. The autonomy of world 3 is most clearly revealed in the way that research continues to turn up new objective problems in its interior. The idea of an objective problem may sound contradictory, but Wachtershauser (1995) has drawn attention to the important position that it has in German patent law. Illustrating his thesis with the example of Galileo's theory of the tides (22, chapter 4, ?9), Popper himself suggested that a better understanding of important events in the history of science, in some respects resembling what is known as hermeneutics, can be reached if an effort is made to reconstruct the objective problem situation in which the scientist worked. Scientific theories cannot be understood unless we understand the objective problems to which they respond. It is important to appreciate that this thesis, which relativizes understanding to problems and to historical context, is quite compatible with the anti-justificationist thesis that the origin of a theory has no relevance to its truth value. Popper made several more visits to the USA in the 1960s and 1970s, and attended and spoke at many international conferences. He continued to refine and to extend his ideas in many areas, especially the philosophy of physics. In 1965 he began work on what was planned as a monograph with the title Exorcizing 'the observer' from modern physics. He wrote the bulk of two long chapters on Einstein's two theories of relativity, and started a chapter on statistical mechanics. Quantum mechanics jumped the queue when he received an urgent call 396</page><page sequence="30">Karl Raimund Popper for a paper (18) in that area, and work on the rest of the monograph was never resumed (some fragments were included in ??34-36 of (23)). Other papers of interest in this period are (19), mentioned earlier, and 'The moral responsibility of the scientist' (41, chapter 6), which contains, among other proposals, a 'tentative restatement' of the Hippocratic oath. The end of the decade was an unhappy time in university life, and even Popper could not remain entirely detached from such issues as the Vietnam war and student unrest. Nonetheless he went on working at Penn. He had had little influence within his own department for some years, partly by choice, partly because Lakatos was sweeping all power to himself. When his retirement and departure from the L.S.E. in 1969 passed almost unnoticed, an era quietly ended. IN RETIREMENT, 1969-94 As with many others who work unremittingly hard, there had always been tasks that Popper could not bring himself to complete, or even to get under way. One of these now began to lour: the behemoth of the Popper volume in The library of living philosophers, a series that in the previous 30 years had produced some useful books, including the excellent Einstein volume (Schilpp 1949). The format of the books was standard: an intellectual autobiography from the victim, a substantial helping of critical and descriptive essays on his work, his replies to criticism, and an exhaustive bibliography. Popper had successfully completed the autobiography (later published separately as (23)) in 1968-70. Thirty three solicited papers had arrived, many of them by the May 1965 deadline. Hansen had compiled a richly detailed bibliography (1974). But Popper had for years been unable to write more than two or three replies and a cursory introduction to them. The threat from Schilpp in June 1971 that, unless he had a complete hand by 1 September, he would shelve the Popper volume indefinitely, roused Popper to concerted action. A small team of assistants and typists was assembled. It was agreed that Popper would draft the outstanding replies, and check the final versions, and that most of the intermediate work would be executed elsewhere. In about six weeks the replies were drafted, knocked into shape, supplied with references, checked and rechecked; at the same time the autobiography was brought editorially into line. (In Schilpp 1974, which amounts to over 1300 pages of printed text, the replies account for about 250 pages, the autobiography and bibliography for about 250 more.) The relief felt at Fallowfield at the end of August when Popper despatched a telegram to Schilpp announcing '666 pages mailed today' was stupendous. The reply that caused Popper the most difficulty-it was more than once rewritten-was the reply to Lakatos (1974). This paper by an ex-colleague, while speaking the language of admiration and benevolence, criticized Popper's solutions of the problems of demarcation and induction with startlingly unoriginal and unsophisticated arguments. According to Lakatos, scientific theories are rarely falsifiable, for in the event of a failed prediction it is always permissible to blame not the theory under test but some auxiliary hypothesis used in the testing process. That ad hoc adjustment may rescue a falsified theory is a well-recognized point (going back at least to Duhem 1906, Part II, chapter VI, ?3, and fully acknowledged in (1), ?6), but it does not show that theories cannot be falsified; only that falsification often requires hard work, because 'nature does not give an answer unless pressed for it' (1, ?85). Popper's solution of the problem of induction was dismissed by Lakatos on the specious grounds that, in the absence of some metaphysical inductive principle connecting the past to the future, it reduces the application of science to the level of irrational dabbling. This is an 397</page><page sequence="31">398 Biographical Memoirs objection that only those who identify rationality with justification can make. (Few who do identify rationality with justification have managed to avoid making it.) Popper's point always was that we connect the past to the future by an empirical theory, and it is simply gratuitous to postulate a metaphysical connection as well. It is astonishing that someone who had been a colleague for a decade should have been unable to do better than this; much less astonishing that Popper was enraged to find the classic panorama of (1) being disfigured by such a philosophical folly. There was thereafter a permanent rift between Popper and Lakatos, who died shortly before Schilpp (1974) appeared. One day in May 1971, Peter Krohn casually asked Medawar why Popper was not a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was told that the only defensible excuse was that no one had ever thought to nominate him. Medawar at once undertook this task, and began to enlist supporters. The election was eventually secured in June 1976, and reported in the press in the unfortunate words '[Popper] was considered exceptional in that his work had fundamentally altered the methods of deduction used by scientists' [405.9]. Noting that his sponsors had included 'some tough-minded experimental scientists', Medawar wrote to him 'I think you can take it that everybody who supported your name was a little bit prouder of being a Fellow of the Royal Society because you are now one of our number' [325.27]. Popper himself was hugely pleased with his Royal, feeling that his contribution to science had at last been recognized. Apparently he did not fully take in that he had not been elected as a fellow scientist, for some years later he telephoned Medawar, upset to see his name included in the list of Fellows elected under Statute 12 along with politicians and others not actively involved in science. Medawar's reply was a masterpiece of tact. Noting that Churchill (whom Popper very much admired, not only for his courage and for his political wisdom, but also for his philosophical good sense) had been elected under Statute 12, he reported the view of the Librarian that 'you could not be elected as a straightforward Sectional candidate and that the Society was so determined to have your name on their books that they decided there was nothing for it but Statute 12'. 'The matter is really too trivial for you to allow it to be a cause of concern' he soothed [325. 29]. But Popper did not see it in exactly that way. In the early 1970s, in the aftermath of a Dutch television discussion in which they had participated in 1971, Popper and Eccles began a joint book on the body/mind problem, 'an attempt in interdisciplinary co-operation' (p. IX). The outcome, The self and its brain (25), is not genuinely a joint work; it contains five philosophical chapters and a summary by Popper, eight chapters by Eccles reporting on the current state of brain research and relating it to the problem of brain/mind interaction, and the edited transcripts of 12 dialogues recorded in September 1974 at the Villa Serbelloni on Lake Como, where the authors were guests of the Rockefeller Foundation. Some of what he nominates as 'the high points of the Dialogues' are mentioned in Eccles (1982). Dualists both, even pluralists, the authors acknowledged in their preface some serious divergences of opinion. In particular, they disagreed about religion. Although ethical issues had always constituted an important part of the background to Popper's philosophy (Kiesewetter 1995; Wachtershauser 1995), in later life he discussed ethics rarely, and religious questions hardly at all. Indeed one of the aspects of Bartley (1962) that he most admired was the way that this book, which was a significant addition to the literature on critical rationalism, made the dilemmas of contemporary protestantism sound interesting. But he sympathized with the religious stance of others, and was not prepared to endorse various humanist and secular offensives: 'Although I am not for religion, I do think that we should show respect for anybody who believes honestly ...' [297.11].</page><page sequence="32">Karl Raimund Popper Popper's contribution to (25) is in the main a development of the preliminary ideas of 'Of clouds and clocks', strengthened by a more explicit doctrine of how the human self, the self- conscious mind, is anchored in world 3; that is, of how personal identity is sustained and in part controlled by the descriptive and argumentative uses of language. As Adam Smith had recognized two centuries before, social life-of which the use of language is a critical part- is an essential condition for the development of full self-consciousness. The book contains a thorough criticism of materialism and physicalism and an enthralling potted history of the subject that, by tracing body/mind dualism back to The Odyssey, attempts to silence the modem doctrine that consciousness of the problem of self-consciousness began with Descartes. But Popper privately regarded his contribution to the book as unsatisfactory, and indeed not properly finished. When it was discovered in March 1977 that Hennie, who had been unwell for some time, had a malignant tumour, he stopped writing and contented himself with tidying and preparing for publication what he had already written. The next eight years were terrible years for them both. Every kind of treatment was considered, in several countries; sometimes the treatment was temporarily successful, sometimes of no apparent benefit at all. During the better spells Popper worked as unflaggingly as ever. Late in 1977 in Cambridge he gave the first Darwin lecture (26), in which he retracted the view-expressed in (23), ?37-that the theory of natural selection is not a scientific theory, but only a metaphysical research programme for biology. The second edition of (27), published in 1979, contains some important new material, particularly on verisimilitude. His writings were often being anthologized, and his books were being translated into many languages. Popper almost never employed the services of a literary agent, preferring to undertake all the negotiation himself. This was certainly a way of keeping busy, but he gradually refined the basic contractual terms that he insisted on and, as one overseas publisher said grudgingly a few years ago, 'he knows what he wants'. The other great demand on his time was the increasing quantity of correspondence that he received. Educators and engineers, epidemiologists and ethnographers, all wanted to share their thoughts with him, and to be rewarded with his response. In the matter of replying to letters-at least to those that he opened and did not at once mislay-he was a model of generosity, though not always of gentleness, often writing in longhand many pages in reply to some quite elementary request. The second and third volumes of the repackaged Postscript were published in the summer of 1982. In a new preface to the third volume (30) he proposed what he hoped was a genuinely realizable experiment that would test the correctness of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This proposal received some critical attention in the scientific literature later (Collett &amp; Loudon 1987; (35); see also Redhead 1995, pp. 167-170). At about the same time, shortly before his 80th birthday, he was appointed to the Order of Companions of Honour. He had received several other prestigious awards and prizes by this time, and the financial rewards that had accompanied some of them had enabled him to begin at last to satisfy his passion for collecting rare books. In 1937 he had managed to save some books from his father's magnificent library, but now he plunged into purchases in an almost reckless spirit. It was his only vice. At the time of his death his library contained first editions of Gilbert's De magnete, Kepler's Harmonices mundi, Galileo's Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems, Hobbes's Leviathan, Hume's Treatise, Rousseau's Discours, each of Kant's three Critiques, Lavoisier's Memoires de chimie and Lyell's Elements; second editions of Newton's Principia and Boyle's Sceptical chymist; and some 200 other antiquarian works on scientific, philosophical and classical subjects, including a copy of the Aldine Aristophanes of 1498 (Sotheby's 1995). 399</page><page sequence="33">Biographical Memoirs In January 1982 George Soros, a Hungarian emigre who had attended Popper's lectures at the L.S.E. in the 1950s, established, with Popper's warm approval, the Open Society Fund, offering Karl Popper Bursaries to black students in South Africa. This was the first in a series of acknowledgements by Soros of the profound importance, especially for those not permitted to implement it, of the idea of an open society, culminating in the founding of the Central European University in 1991 in Budapest, Prague, and Warsaw, and the Open Society Prize in 1994. 'His work has been an inspiration to the Central European University' said Soros in his presentation speech to Popper, the first recipient of the prize (Soros et al. 1995, p. 34). The open society was widely studied in samizdat translations in eastern Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, and continues to be more deeply appreciated there (Havel 1995) than it is in better- established liberal democracies. 'The little revolution in my country in 1980-81 had its theoretician. It was you, Sir.' wrote a Polish student feelingly in 1982 [284.6]. Following the rapid and almost peaceful disintegration of the socialist tyrannies in 1989 and 1991, which he insisted that he had not foreseen, Popper took a close interest in the preparation of the Russian translation of (38) The open society, published by the Soros Foundation in Moscow in1992. In his message to Russian readers, and repeatedly in conversations with friends, he spoke of the dangers of converting the Russian economy to a market system in advance of the setting up of a working and respected tradition of civil law (Simkin 1993, pp. 198f.; (45), chapter 4). By the late summer of 1985 Hennie's condition had so much worsened that the Poppers decided to return for a while to Vienna, where several members of her family still lived. She spent some weeks in hospital, after which they rented a large house in the western suburbs of the city, close to what had once been the Emperor's hunting chase. Here in November she died. Popper, loving and romantic, but not sentimental, quickly came to terms with his loss, and renewed his manifold intellectual interests, above all in quantum physics, the theory of probability and evolutionary epistemology. For some months his plans for the future were undecided. There was much well-meaning local enthusiasm to keep 'the great Austrian philosopher' in his home country. In 1976 both he and Hennie had resumed Austrian nationality, though the motive for this had been Popper's firm expectation that he would die before his wife, who would then have been able to return home. But an attempt to capture him by establishing a new branch of the Boltzmann Institut [fur Wissenschaftstheorie = for the philosophy of science] in the house in Kramer Glockner Stral3e, with Popper as Director, did not prosper. In the summer of 1986 he returned to England for good. For the next eight years he lived in Kenley (Surrey), in another house, like those in Penn and Vienna, that was perched on the edge of nowhere. (No doubt this was the most that he could concede to utopianism.) Fallowfield had been sold, and the new house bought on his behalf, by his secretary Melitta Mew and her husband Raymond, who were to be his principal support, and his unshakable friends, for the remainder of his life. Much more than a secretary, Mrs Mew (who had started working for him in 1982 in a part-time capacity at the L.S.E.) energetically but gently reorganized nearly every aspect of Popper's life and his household. Filing cabinets were installed, and order brought to his business affairs (which had been neglected for some years). A daily housekeeper (for whom he was always touchingly just 'Professor'-never 'Professor Popper' or 'Sir Karl') kept house. He lived in comfort, though hardly in luxury. His birthdays were celebrated with small lunch parties for his closest friends. He was very well looked after. Not always physically well, suffering many small tachycardias and minor strokes, as well as some more serious problems, he nonetheless maintained a noble independence, and an undiminished vitality of mind. 'I am having a very happy old age' he said 400</page><page sequence="34">Karl Raimund Popper on many occasions. His friends shared in his well-being, and were time and time again affected by his warmth and by his exceptional generosity. Many visitors came to the house prepared for battle, and departed hours later disarmed, not by argument but by an utterly unsuspected charm. At the end of Unended quest Popper had described himself as 'one who feels that in struggling with ideas he has found more happiness than he could ever deserve'. In his last few years, perhaps for the first time, his whole life was a source of genuine happiness. In 1986 Popper was appointed the first Medawar Lecturer at the Royal Society. He had a large audience, but the lecture, 'A new interpretation of Darwinism' (33), was sadly not one of his best. This is perhaps understandable given the turmoil of the previous year. In the lecture, which was not properly written, and was unfortunately never prepared for publication, he set himself a large agenda, which he was unable to cope with fully. Returning to the theme of active Darwinism, and identifying biological adaptation with the acquisition of knowledge, he suggested that the difficulties in the establishment of life (both naturally and artificially) may lie more in the failure of life-forms to be adapted to their environment than in their original creation. On the grounds that what characterizes life is problem-solving (as depicted in the scheme above, something that cannot be reduced, he claimed, to chemistry, he defended the use in biology of anthropomorphic and even teleological language, aversion to the latter being likened to the Victorian aversion to talking about sex. The constant theme, that problem- solving is the key to a general theory of life (a theory to be contrasted with that of Schrodinger 1967, that feeding on negative entropy is the characteristic feature; see (23), ?30) was incorporated into the title of a book of essays (43) published shortly after his death. Some (for example, Gellner 1996, pp. 80, 84) have dismissed these ideas as a return to a romanticism scarcely distinguishable from nineteenth-century Naturphilosophie. A criticism of Popper's Medawar lecture is to be found in Perutz (1986). A feature of Popper's intellectual life was that the discovery of a wealth of new problems hardly ever had much effect on his fascination with old ones; time and again he returned with relish to a topic of years past. A striking example is the return in (32) and its extended sequel (34) to the doctrine that the problem of induction can be solved by means of considerations of probability. The renewed attack on this doctrine began with the discovery in 1981, while (31) was being prepared for publication, of an unnoticed minor error in Part II, ? 15; and grew into the claim that, even if the probability of a scientific theory h can be increased by empirical evidence e, that increase is a purely deductive effect, depending crucially on the extent to which the contents of h and e overlap. Indeed it was proved that the ampliative part h &lt;- e of a hypothesis h (that part of h that goes beyond what the evidence e says) is never positively supported by e; in brief, p(h v- e I e) &lt; p(h &lt;- e) for every h and every e. The conclusion drawn was that, even if there is such a thing as probabilistic support, there is nothing inductive about it: there is no inductive logic. This was a deeply satisfying result for someone who had spent half a century fighting this most inexplicably adhesive of philosophical prejudices. But if there was any one intellectual problem that dominated Popper's thought and captured his imagination in his last decade it was not the problem of induction, nor any other philosophical problem, but the problem of the origin of life, mentioned briefly in the Medawar Lecture and, Popper tells us in (23), ?5, a problem that began to bother him at the age of 12 or 13. From the outset he was deeply involved in the development of Waichtershauser's theory of the 'iron-sulphur world' (1988), according to which life began with acellular, effectively two- dimensional, organisms bonded to positively charged surfaces such as pyrite. Wachtershauser, a chemist who had become a patent attorney, had met Popper in 1982 in Alpbach, a meeting 401</page><page sequence="35">Biographical Memoirs that, he says, 'drew him back to science'. For years they spent many hours weekly on the telephone discussing every aspect, substantial and methodological, of Wichtershauser's theory; and it was with tremendous enthusiasm and pride that Popper would keep his friends up to date about the progress of the theory, his intellectual godson, especially when there were new experimental results to report (37). His contribution to the success of the theory is not to be underestimated (Wachtershauser 1995, 1997). It was an exemplary instance of his unquenchable curiosity, and of his utter devotion to the search for truth. As Popper became more celebrated, more sought after, more honoured, he turned once more to face the outside world. Deeply anguished as a youth, and disappointed in middle age, but for years not actively political, in his old age he began to speak out on issues of public concern, from the enormity of the Russian nuclear arsenal to the evil effects of violence on television (45, chapters 3 and 7). On many occasions he held forth on the vanity and the dangers of nationalism (44). He spoke with increasing frequency of the moral duty of intellectuals to be optimistic but not complacent, to adopt the modest critical rationalist motto 'I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth' (4, chapter 24, ?i), and to open their eyes to the beauties of the world. He disliked intensely the anti-scientific ideology that he saw in the ecological movement, and seemed confident that, although science had admittedly been responsible for much damage, it alone had the power to correct these mistakes (45, chapter 9). The population explosion he viewed with the greatest concern. Earnest and moralistic he may often have been, but he retained his impish humour. On the way to Barcelona in 1989 to receive the Catalunya Prize, for example, he disconcerted his companions by insisting that, since one of the conditions of the prize was that it could not be awarded posthumously, he must buy instant travel insurance for the equivalent of the prize money. Lecturing on Feynman's suggestion that a positron is an electron travelling backwards in time, he expressed the doubt that his bank manager would willingly regard his mounting overdraft as a credit balance moving backwards in time. He had a good eye for the incongruous, for example the way in which so many papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA are labelled as 'advertisements'. When he gave a lecture to the L.S.E. Alumni Association in 1989, he solemnly announced that, since this was his first public lecture at the School, he regarded it as a belated inaugural lecture; 'It is an occasion to which I have been looking forward eagerly for the last 40 years' he declared (36, p. 29). Working to the very end of his life, he was preparing, among other things, a short note (to appear in (46)) on the proof given by Aristotle (Metaphysics 1051 a 28f.) that the angle in a semicircle is a right angle; and sharing the writing of a short response to an article critical of the main thesis of (34). The end came quickly. On Saturday 10 September 1994 he was taken into hospital for what was plainly to be a serious, even dangerous, operation. This went well, but it revealed unexpectedly grave problems. He was thereafter in great pain for much of the time, though characteristically able to make his presence felt throughout the ward. For a few days he was as conscious and alert as ever, and when not in pain peacefully cheerful. He died early in the morning of 17 September. His body was cremated, and some weeks later his ashes were laid, as he had requested, in his wife's grave in the Lainzer Friedhof, a small cemetery in Vienna. In 1992 Karl Popper had been made an honorary citizen of the City of Vienna, and the grave is to be maintained in perpetuity by this city of innumerable illustrious names. 402</page><page sequence="36">Karl Raimund Popper PROFESSIONAL CAREER 1937-40 Lecturer in Philosophy, Canterbury College, University of New Zealand. 1941-46 Senior Lecturer in Philosophy, Canterbury College, University of New Zealand. 1945-48 Reader in Logic and Scientific Method, London School of Economics. 1949-69 Professor of Logic and Scientific Method, University of London. 1951-53 Chairman, Philosophy of Science Group of the British Society for the History of Science (now the British Society for the Philosophy of Science). 1958-59 President, Aristotelian Society. 1959-61 President, British Society for the Philosophy of Science. 1969-94 Emeritus Professor of Logic and Scientific Method, University of London. 1986-94 Senior Research Fellow, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace (Stanford). 1986-94 Visiting Professor, University of Vienna.
