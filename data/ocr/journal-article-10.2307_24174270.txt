<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES Numerous traditions have been linked to the name of R. Elijah, Gaon of Vilna, beginning during his lifetime and continuing in greater measure after his death. In light of the dearth of his own writings, his authentic viewpoints on many issues have remained shrouded in mystery. Different ideological groups have engaged in intense debate as to the true nature of his heritage. In "'Peshaf and 'Derash' in the Mishna — On the Metamorphosis of a Tradition from the School of R. Elijah of Vilna", Chanan Gafni examines one tradition linked to R. Elijah, concerning the Talmudic interpretation of the Mishna. According to this tradition, the Mishna has both a peshat (plain, simple meaning) and a derash (hermeneutic interpretation). The Talmud, in its interpretation of the Mishna, focused solely on the derash of the Mishna, leaving students of the Mishna free to reconstruct its peshat. The writings of R. Elijah himself bear not a trace of any explicit statement in this spirit. Nevertheless, R. Elijah did exhibit, more than once, a cautious willingness to interpret — and even to emend, without any further ado — the language of the Mishna in a way that was explicitly opposed to the way it had been interpreted in the Talmud. During the generations following R. Elijah's death, a stormy debate ensued between maskilim and more conservative thinkers as to the reliability of the tradition concerning the existence of peshat and derash in the Mishna, and as to how to understand this tradition. While maskilim taught this tradition repeatedly, finding in it echoes of a critical approach and even support for introducing 'corrections' into Jewish law, the more conservative sages expressed their reservations or completely rejected it. Very few seem to have remained loyal to the spirit and to the correct understanding of R. Elijah's approach to interpreting the Mishna. In ",Sometimes They Need Another Carpenter to Give the Final Hammer Blow' — Nahmanides on Indirect Damages", Shalem Yahalom deals with Nahmanides' booklet"Dina de-Garmi" ("The Law of [Payable] Indirect Damages"). Nahmanides wrote the monograph with the intent of rejecting a possible distinction between direct action and indirect action, and of establishing that one who caused damage is obliged to remunerate the victim, as a matter of basic law, in both cases. Nahmanides * Edited by Dr. David Mescheloff.</page><page sequence="2">VI ENGLISH SUMMARIES saw human action as the principal legal theoretic source of obligation in damages, and argued that a person who caused damage must be held accountable for the consequences of his behavior, even in cases of duress, when he is clearly guiltless. According to Nahmanides' approach, the action as a cause of obligation outweighs other causes of obligation. Thus, for example, it is the one who dug a pit who is responsible for the damage it causes, and not the owner of the land in which the pit was dug. One consequence of this approach is the release from obligation accorded to a witness and to a bailee (a person with whom an article is deposited); there are ways in which they may cause damage without performing an action, and, therefore, they are not liable on the basis of the law of payable indirect damages. Nahmanides acknowledged, then, that there are especially indirect actions that do release one from having to compensate the victim, but he differed with his predecessors over the question of the definition of such cases. In contrast with Nahmanides' approach, the Tosafists generally acknowledged the existence of other legal theoretic sources of obligation — other than human action. These included the need to impose fines, under certain real life circumstances, whose purpose was to prevent those who might cause harm to others from finding a loophole in Jewish law. Other sources of obligation include a person's duty to prevent himself from causing harm, and an owner's responsibility for mishaps caused by his property. In order to prevail against these approaches, Nahmanides returned to the basic positions of the first Tosafists, and to the analytical methods of their schools. Nahmanides used these tools to confirm the generally accepted halakhic decisions of the Spanish sages. The schools of Provence served as an important and highly valuable source for Nahmanides' views concerning dina de-garmi. The great Provencal sages, R. Abraham b. David (Rabad) and his father-in-law and teacher R. Abraham b. Yitzhak of Narbonne, wrote monographs on indirect damages before Nahmanides, and one can find parallels and conflicts between these booklets. Nahmanides lived in Gerona, the Catalan city south of Provence, and a review of the geopolitical and cultural situation at that time makes these connections self-evident. The Mishna (Berachot 1:3) reports a dispute between the schools of Shammai and of Hillel as to the physical posture appropriate during the recitation of the Shema. The Tosefta (Berachot 1:4) records the story of the different practices of two sages: Rabbi Yishmael followed the view of the school of Hillel, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria followed the view of the school of Shammai. This story is recorded also in the Sifre (Devarim 34), in the Yerushalmi (Berachot 1:2 3b), and in the Bavli (Berachot 1 la). In "The Recital of Shema by R. Yishmael and by R. Elazar b. Azaria and the Decision that the Halakha Follows the School of Hillel", Mordechai</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES VII Sabato performs a comparative analysis of the various sources. Sabato concludes that the original version of the story was preserved in the Tosefta and the Sifre, that it went through one stage of editing and revision to produce the version in the Yerushalmi, and that it underwent another stage of editing and reworking to produce the version in the Bavli. Sabato seeks to identify the motives for this editing and its significance, particularly as it relates to the question of reaching halakhic decisions in the disputes between the schools of Shammai and Hillel. In "The Term of the Nazirite Observance and the Ceremony at its Conclusion — A Study in Tannaitic Interpretation", Ariel Furstenberg and Yair Furstenberg focus on the relationship between these two principal components of the Nazirite's obligations. Both the Biblical passage and the rabbinic descriptions of Nazirites during the second Temple period raise the question as to the principal purpose of the Nazirite vow: was it the Nazirite life style during the term during which his vow was in effect, or was it the carrying out of the Nazirite's obligations in the Temple at the conclusion of that term? This question is central to the tannaitic discussions concerning the Nazirite. Indeed, the Furstenbergs identify the unfolding of this issue in tannaitic literature over an extended period. The issue appears in the earliest layers of the Mishna, when the sages had the most direct contact with both biblical interpretation and actual practice during the Second Temple period. It continued in subsequent generations, when later tannaim discussed the words of their predecessors and developed their theories. In the first layer we find a dispute among the sages of Yavne. The majority of sages held that the concluding ceremony should not be seen as standing on its own, but rather that its full significance stems from its association with the period of Nazirite observance that preceded it. On the other hand, in accordance with the familiar practice from the Temple period, when the Nazirite's sacrifices were brought long after the conclusion of his term as a Nazirite, R. Eliezer represented the position that saw each of the two components as having independent meaning. Following this fundamental dispute, which was expressed in several Mishnaic discussions, one can discern subsequent layers in the Mishna, in which tannaim and the redactor of the Mishna developed the viewpoint of the majority of the earlier sages. Further processing of the dispute may be found in the tannaitic literature outside the Mishna; both Tosefta and Sifri present consistent positions on this question. At the conclusion of the interpretive process, a novel position was accepted in the final Mishna, according to which the climax of the Nazirite process takes place specifically at the beginning of the Temple ceremony, the point at which the two principal lines intersect. The subject examined here makes it possible to discern the development of interpretation within the tannaitic period: from the early Mishna through the later Mishna and on to the</page><page sequence="4">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES latest sources — Sifri and Tosefta — which complete, in their customary fashion, the earlier layers. Yoel Fixier and Hanan Eshel show, in "Tearing Divorce Documents in Light of the Documents from the Judean Desert", that the inventory of documents discovered in the Judean Desert supports the literary sources that indicate that it was customary to tear divorce documents in the Bar Kokhba period. There is but one get (divorce document) among the documents, and that is from the First Jewish Revolt (71 CE). Although there is only one get, there is evidence of divorce between Jews in four other documents. The absence of divorce documents is particularly noteworthy against the background of the three Aramaic ketubot and the five marriage contracts written in Greek that were found in the escape caves from the Bar Kokhba period. Fixier and Eshel believe that the absence of divorce documents from the Bar Kokhba period has to do with the halakha recorded in Mishna Gittin 6:2 and Mishna Ketubot 9:9, which states that, from the time of danger — that is, from the Bar Kokhba period — it was customary to tear these divorce documents in the bet din (Jewish law court). Rabbinic Judaism as recorded in the Talmudic and Midrashic corpus presented God anthropomorphically, in visual terms, remaining faithful to the simple meaning of Scripture. In "How Much Anthropomorphism? Allowing the Aggada to Speak for Itself', Shamma Friedman examines the extent to which anthropomorphic representations of God are present in aggadic literature. First Friedman addresses Maimonides' struggle against traditional anthro pomorphic concepts. Portraying God as a formless being entered Jewish conceptualization only where Judaism intersected with Greek thought, viz., Philo, Saadia Gaon, and Maimonides. Traditional Talmudic culture never abandoned the indigenous Jewish concepts. Much of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed was devoted to expunging the simple meaning of 'image' in Genesis 1, 27 and similar usages, and to distancing himself from the unsophisticated who held that 'the image of God' has a visual connotation. These same themes were already addressed in detail in his early work, the Commentary to the Mishna. Maimonides read the texts as allegorical and the like. Although the traditionalists attempted to retaliate, Maimonides' powerful intellectual stature and influence eventually wiped out all vestiges of the anthropomorphic God in accepted dogma. In the second part of the paper Friedman discusses the theme of humanity bearing the divine image in biblical and Ancient Near Eastern literature. An Akkadian priest of the seventh century BCE often compared the kings he served to gods. An Assyrian king was described this way in an epic poem in the thirteenth century BCE.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES IX These documents used the god-likeness theme as a conceit of court etiquette. The Assyrian epic was closer to an ontological doctrine, it too applied in the context of praising the king's noble nature. By way of contrast, Genesis presented creation in the Divine image as the full-blown reality of the human situation, democratized from royal to universal, with the literal physical sense foremost in its conceptualization. The God who banned carved, molded and cast votary representations of His form chose humanity itself for this function. The belief in the humanlike form of the Godhead is expressed fully and openly in explicit theophanies, such as in Ezekiel 1, not, however, without the veil of hesitation and holding back, as befits behavior even in the presence of a mortal monarch. Other passages, such as Deut. 4:12 and Is. 40:18 use greater refrain, as behooves theological tact and politeness, but no more than that. They do not stem from philosophic anti-anthropomorphism, contra Maimonides and Weinfeld. The same may be said about circumlocutions in Onqolos. In the third part of the paper, after reviewing and elucidating commonly cited rabbinic passages revealing an openly anthropomorphic stance, Friedman discusses an additional passage which should be interpreted as an unrecognized visual presentation of the divine image, with human likenesses indistinguishable in both physique and physiognomy. Jacob was the outstanding representative of this paradigm. Friedman cites a Talmudic passage that registers similarity of visage regarding famous biblical and rabbinic personalities, ultimately comparing the beauty of Adam to the Divine Presence. This is an elaboration of the biblical theme that man was created in the image of God. Friedman derives a corroboration of this interpretation from a Hekhalot text. Friedman also cites a passage from Midrash of the Ten Martyrs, which clarifies the issue still further. In the medieval period at least two Midrashic works on Ecclesiastes — both known as "Midrash Kohelet" — circulated among the libraries of the rishonim. Both Midrashim provide diverse Midrashic material, including dicta, exegeses, and narratives, as commentaries and interpretations of verses in Ecclesiastes. The longer Midrash, now known as "Kohelet Rabbah" (Ecclesiastes Rabbah), was first printed in Constantinople in 1520, and afterwards in Pesaro. It includes Midrashic material on almost every verse of the Biblical book. The shorter Midrash was published for the first time in Berlin (1894) by Solomon Buber, who called it "Kohelet Zuta" (Ecclesiastes Zuta). Kohelet Zuta relates only to nine chapters of the Biblical book, and does not relate to every verse. Reuven Kiperwasser, in "A Comparative Study of the Midrashim on Ecclesiastes — On the Nature of Koheleth Zuta", discusses the relationship between Kohelet Zuta and Kohelet Rabbah. A comparison of the two reveals much affinity, but also</page><page sequence="6">X ENGLISH SUMMARIES not inconsiderable difference. Each of the works contains indicators of originality in one place, and of its being of a secondary nature in another, so that it cannot be determined that one work was derived from the other. Kiperwasser concludes that each of the Midrashim developed as an independent composition from a common source. The hypothetical "early Midrash Kohelet" which is not extant, was composed during the period of the Land of Israel amoraim; Kohelet Rabbah and Kohelet Zuta assumed their final forms in the post-Talmudic period. The name "Ben Drusai" is mentioned in both the Bavli and the Yerushalmi in the context of the laws of the Sabbath. Heating food to the extent of "Ben Drusai's food" defines the minimal measure of "cooking" prohibited on the Sabbath. The Talmud did not explain who "Ben Drusai" was, but Rashi wrote that he was a brigand who used to cook his food quickly. Various researchers have suggested different proposals as to who the man was, where he lived and during which period. Some linked him to the "Bar Drusai" mentioned in the Yerushalmi, a contemporary of R. Yohanan. Others linked him to Doras, one of the heads of the Sikarikon. Another possibility that has been raised is that the source of the name is in the village "Drosis", or "Drosiah" (Hirbet Madras). In "On the Identity of Ben Drusai",- Shlomy Raiskin raises a new conjecture. In 4ICE Tiberius Claudius Drusus was appointed Emperor of Rome. Claudius had noticeable physical limitations, and he may have suffered from cerebral palsy. On account of these disabilities, Claudius called himself "Ben Drusi" in his inscriptions (in Greek: Apobaot) uidq; in Latin: Drusi Filius or Drusi Filio). This mention of his warrior father, Drosos, and of his warrior brother, Germanicus (also son of Drosos), was intended to convey the message that Claudius was fit to be emperor, in spite of his disabilities. Rome had many places for drinking, inns and taverns. Cooked meat was very popular among the Romans. Contemporary historians recorded that, at the beginning of his reign, Claudius issued an edict prohibiting the sale of cooked meat and hot water, and punished violators of the edict. The aim of the prohibition was to prevent meetings and public gatherings, since people used to gather to drink in taverns. As a consequence of this edict, and out of fear of the government, a new way of selling cooked meat developed — in general, the meat was cooked and sold in the street, in changing locations and, presumably, in haste. If so, it was natural that a provisional food prepared in haste would be named after the one who had issued the decree against selling cooked meat. Thus "Ben Drusai's food" is food that was cooked only partially, on account of the decree of Emperor Claudius, nicknamed "Ben Drusi" on his official inscriptions.</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES XI In "On the Terms 'Kiddush Hodesh', 'Birkat Levana' and 'Kiddush Levana'", Yaakov Shmuel Spiegel addresses the meaning of these three terms. The distinction between them is often blurred today. Spiegel gives the following interpretations: 1. Kiddush Hodesh — To the tannaim, "hodesh" referred either to the first of the month ("the new Moon") or to the moon, but in the expression "kiddush ha-hodesh" it always denoted the first day of the month, for that is what was sanctified by the court. 2. Kiddush Levana — The verb kadesh seems to appear in relation to the moon only once in the Bavli, and, perhaps, in a late Midrash. The phrase "kiddush levana" appears only at the end of the period of the rishonim, and only in the writings of two sages. In all of those sources this is an alternate expression for "kiddush ha-hodesh". This does pose a slight difficulty, in that there is no real connection between the verb kadesh and the moon. A more widespread and common denotation of this term sees it as another way of saying "birkat levana", the blessing of the moon. Spiegel suggests that this meaning was created and became widespread in Ashkenaz. It is difficult to find testimonies to the use of this term outside of Ashkenaz before the invention of print. After the invention of the printing press, the use of this expression spread to many places outside of Ashkenaz. Indeed, it is difficult to understand the use of the word "kiddush" in this expression, and Spiegel notes several explanations that have been proposed. 3. Birkat Ha-Levana — Jews are required to recite a blessing upon seeing the new moon. This requirement existed also during the period when the new month was declared after a visual sighting of the new moon. This obligation is mentioned both in the Bavli and in the Yerushalmi. The rishonim gave this blessing a name; most called it "birkat ha-levana", and a minority called it "birkat ha-yareach". Spiegel discusses the formulation of the blessing's closing phrase and its interpretation.</page></plain_text>
