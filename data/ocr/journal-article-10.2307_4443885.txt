<plain_text><page sequence="1">he Doctrine of Special Creation By RICHARD P. AULIE * First part of a two-part article. The second part, to appear in the May issue, will include references cited here. The handsome textbook Biology: a Search for Order in Complexity (Moore and Slusher, 1970) will startle all NABT teachers who have been taking the teaching of evolution for granted. (See reviews, ABT 33 [7]: 438-442.) Moore and Slusher assert that "special creation" is as reasonable and scientific an account of origins as the doctrine of evolution and that it should be given equal time in high school biology classes. This book therefore raises anew the entire question of the relationship between religion and science. Actually, the special-creation doctrine, as pre- sented in this textbook, is quite old. It was widely held during the first half of the 19th century. In order to assess the implications of the doctrine for our time-whether we agree or disagree-we need to see what it was in the past. The antecedent views will be discussed in the course of examining the doctrine's main points. The Book and Its Sponsors This book was produced by the Creation Research Society, which holds that "science should be re- aligned within the framework of Biblical creation- ism," according to a recent CRS leaflet. Today there are about 350 voting members of CRS, and some are holders of doctorates. Predominantly Protestant, they are strongly conservative in their theology. (CRS should be distinguished from the American Scientific Affiliation. Though it was founded, in 1941, to explore the relations between science and the Bible, ASA has a quite different intellectual orienta- tion. CRS disapproves of ASA because it refuses to take a stand against evolution. At a meeting of ASA at Asbury College, in Kentucky, in 1963, a group of members found themselves in agreement on creation and catastrophism; subsequently they formed the separate organization now called CRS [Lammerts, 1970, p. 1-4]. The Journal of the ASA often carries articles that oppose, scientifically, the views held by the creationists. One can find in JASA strong, docu- mented refutations of creationist views on geology, Noah's flood, entropy, spontaneous generation, the origin of life, and the nature of species [see refer- ences].) Although the CRS textbook is attractive, its pub- lication has dismayed those who had hoped the evo- lution controversy was at last over in American education. The care and expense that have been in- vested in this apologia for a 19th-century view are astonishing: 20 writers, all with graduate degrees in the sciences, contributed to its development. Yet although the book is an anachronism it may be wel- comed by some church-related schools and by school- board members who are worried about atheism among the young. And there are even some NABT members-about whom I am primarily concerned in this review-to whom the arguments may appeal as an alternative to the doctrine of evolution, even while they teach from BSCS textbooks. They may Richard P. Aulie specializes in the history of biology and medicine; see biographic footnote, ABT 33 (8): 461.

Thus, this book may well rekindle an old contro- versy. If so, let us hope that decorum may prevail. In the history of biology, different investigators often have interpreted the same data from opposite points of view. Those investigators now seem the more dig- nified who argued with calm, goodwill, and reason, even though their interpretations were later replaced. By contrast, those who resorted to exaggeration, and invective, even when in the right, in retrospect seem only entertaining. In any case, let us be calm. We have here a splendid opportunity to note the strong historical antecedents of the "special creation" doctrine-stronger, perhaps, than the authors imag- ine. What, after all, is "creationism"? May it be viewed as a scientific theory, as distinguished from a theologic doctrine? We may also appreciate the complex factors involved in resistance to change. The older high school biology textbooks differed widely from that ushered in by the Biological Sci- ences Curriculum Study, in 1960. The CRS text car- ries a strong resemblance to the former; that is, biology is presented as an established body of knowl- edge rather than a method of inquiry into organic nature. Nor does the book reflect the major innova- tions in teaching methods-process and inquiry- that revolutionized high school biology in the 1960s and are now penetrating the new elementary-school science curricula. Nevertheless, except for the sections on creation- ism and on evolution, together with certain factual errors and questionable emphases, the book is a well- organized source of information on what is tradi- tionally called biology. Moreover, the authors have achieved a style that BSCS writers may well envy. It is interesting to read. In the discussion that follows we shall identify units, chapters, and pages of Biology: a Search for Order in Complexity by the abbreviation BSOC. The major arguments for creationism appear for the most part in BSOC unit 9, "Theories of Biological Change," and this section will be read first by those who want to know what the fuss is all about. Else- where the authors' views obtrude from time to time; some of these passages I shall examine below. BSOC p. 3-13, on the scientific method, is a thoughtful introduction to the text. But how would the authors document the view on p. 9 (reasserted on BSOC p. 4, 12, 61) that "the Greeks did no ex- tensive experimentation because of a prejudice against work?" Can they be referring to Galen, whose vivisection experiments, as described in his Natural Faculties (book 2) and Anatomical Pro- cedures (books 7, 12, 14), were far-reaching in their impact on later biology? Contempt for manual labor does not necessarily imply disregard for experiments. That the Greeks placed less emphasis on experi- ments, in the sense in which we use the term, has more to do with the questions they asked of nature than with any notion that experimentation was "de- grading work," as we are told on BSOC p. 4. More- over the Greeks did not find regularity and pattern in nature "through a study of cause and effect rela- tionships" (BSOC p. 12). Their scientific method- as represented, for example, in Aristotle's Genera- tion of Animals (book 1) and Parts of Animals (book 1) -was quite different from the modern scientific method, now associated with the phrase "cause and effect," which began to emerge during the Renais- sance. The section on zoology deals with animals "with backbones" and "without backbones"-a surprising division, in view of the creationist presuppositions. This was the division made by Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829), who was an "evolutionist." The doctrine of special creation may be considered under three aspects: the design argument, catastro- phism, and the ideal type. (The third of these will be dealt with in the May issue.) The Design Argument In at least nine passages BSOC authors assert that providential design may be discerned in nature. Examples are the purpose of the Creator as observed in the direction of plant growth (p. 12); the ap- parently purposive behavior of the amoeba (p. 65); the variability of flowers, birds' songs, and animal behavior (p. 147); the taxonomic categories of plants (p. 183); the marvels of human vision (p. 281, 443); the sexual reproduction of bacteria and the life cycles of algae (p. 173-174, 396); and particular adaptations of plants and animals (p. 476). Because teleology is anathema to modern biology, these passages will be taken as marks of an unsci- entific attitude. In the context of the book, however, the authors do not argue that design is always a sub- stitute for scientific research or a full explanation of biologic phenomena. They do include a consider- able fund of chemical, physiologic, and genetic infor- mation concerning organic processes that once were given a teleologic explanation. Nevertheless, their teleologic passages perhaps represent the core of the long controversy over special creation. They illus- trate why it is so easy to misunderstand the theologic problem of design in nature. High school students may now conclude that if God created Spirogyra with its own special life-cycle (BSOC p. 396), then natural processes did not, for the two interpretations are mutually exclusive. Definition of Design These passages express the traditional view of design, which implies that the end precedes the means. According to this view, the preordained end is executed in the form of a structure or process by 192 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1972</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1. Skeleton of a mammoth, from Cuvier's Recherches sur les Ossemen~s Fossiles (4th ed., 1836, atlas, vol. I. plate 17). It was discovered in the delta of the Lena River in 1806 in northern Siberia (lat. 700). This was the kind of evidence Cuvier used to show that animals really had become extinct. Such discoveries stirred the imagination when special creation was the dominant view. Many people found it strange that the Lord, having once created such handsome creatures, should find it necessary to get rid of them. Some thought they had been created to confound the horrid geologists. Lyell showed that at the time this mammoth was interred the Siberian climate must have been as cold as it is today and that, moreover, the sudden and quite local freezing of water or snow in the far north often traps present-day animals (Lyell, 1854, p. 75-86. See also Greene, 1959, p. 123, 343; Miller, 1857, p. 162, 329, 397, 398). (i) an immaterial agency-that is, some vitalistic force residing in the organism; or (ii) an intelligence, or God, external to the organism, which is therefore an expression of divine providence. The CRS authors advocate the latter version. In the former version, and sometimes in the latter, the importance of sec- ondary causation is reduced. (Vitalists are not neces- sarily theists, and vice versa.) Design is often sug- gested when the observer experiences a feeling of wonder as he contemplates the exquisite and intri- cate character of a particular adaptation. The design argument is even older and more pres- tigious than the doctrine of special creation. For example, the vitalistic version is a unifying theme in Galen's On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, in which he approved the Aristotelian view that "nature does nothing in vain" (May, 1968, II, p. 501). Galen argued that the forethought exhibited by the skillful way in which the structures of the eye are joined together surely expresses the "wisdom of the Creator," which he ascribed never to an external intelligence, for he was not a theist in the usual sense, but sometimes to a beneficient "Nature" (May, 1968, II, p. 463-503). Modern biology has rendered unnecessary this vitalistic version of design, but it cannot rule out divine providence, as Darwin recog- nized in his own discussion of the eye (Origin, 1st ed., p. 188, 189). But to affirm that biology cannot rule out divine providence is not the same as saying, as the BSOC authors seem to say, that providential design is an a forteriori conclusion one draws from observing DOCTRINE OF SPECIAL CREATION 193</page><page sequence="4">RELIQULE DILUVIANAE; 0R, OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORGANIC REMAINS CONTAINED 1IN CAVES, FISSURES, AND DILUVIAL GRAVEL, AND ON OTHER GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA, ATTESTING THE ACTION OF AN UNIVERSAL DELUGE.

William Buckland made numerous contri- butions to geology and paleontology. In this book he sought to correlate his findings with the Genesis account of the flood. A man of great ability, he taught geology at Oxford Univer- sity, where Lyell was his student. Notice the date: seven years before the publication of Lyell's Principles of Geology (vol. 1), which showed that past events need not be explained by a diluvial catastrophe, as Buckland thought. events in nature. We do not observe design in nature. Rather, our minds seem to be so constructed that we can perceive regularities to which, if we have re- ligious presuppositions, we apply the concept of de- sign. Futhermore, to make of design a biologic prin- ciple, as in these passages in the CRS book, is to reduce the need to interpret biologic processes as precurors of the adaptation that evokes wonder. Modern biology is then in jeopardy. The CRS posi- tion must lead inevitably to the view (although the authors do not go this far) that biologic processes cannot express cause-and-effect relationships; that is, they must be merely a series of discrete and unrelated events. If design is a sufficient and exclu- sive explanation of how an amoeba moves (BSOC p. 65), then it is all right to study its environmental conditions; but we can never be sure that they are causal agencies that influence such behavior. By contrast, biology cannot say that such causal agencies, whether operating within the life-span of a single organism or joining together many different organisms over long periods of time, as in evolution, do not themselves, from the theologic point of view, represent the expression of divine providence in design. The BSOC authors reject the latter-the evolutionary process-but their position cannot sus- tain the former (as they hope), because they ap- parently hold that design may be observed a for- teriori in nature. The question of design worried Asa Gray (1810- 88), the American friend of Charles Darwin (1809- 82), even more than did the new questions concern- ing the Genesis account of creation. When he found out, in 1857, what Darwin was up to (F. Darwin, 1887, I, p. 477-482), he hurried off a letter to ask whether natural selection were now to become a substitute for divine providence. Darwin assured him that natural selection was not such an agent; it only described various actions in nature, much as a geologist uses the term "denudation" (F. Darwin, 1903, 1, p. 126; Dupree, 1968, p. 247; Greene, 1961, p. 296, 297). If design were to explain variation, Darwin went on, then the number and direction of Fantail feathers would have been created to suit some pigeon-fancier (F. Darwin, 1887, II, p. 146). Gravity There was a striking parallel in the 1860s between the religious objections first. raised against natural selection and those formerly raised against the idea of gravity, which was feared in the time of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) as unfriendly to religion. Gray saw at once the parallel between Darwin and Newton but had to agree, in his review of the Origin, that gravity was no longer a religious question concerning design (Dupree, 1963, p. 44). In this respect, the BSOC authors apparently are not worried about any threat to theism posed by a physical agency. It may be pertinent to inquire why. If natural selection, which is a biologic process, is a threat to theism, why should not gravity, a physical process, also be considered a threat, par- ticularly since it is more universal in its applications? After all, if gravity holds the planets in orbit, then the Almighty is not on the job. Why not simply say that Mars was "designed" to travel in an elliptical orbit? Darwin pointed out in the first edition of his Origin that using the term "design" is not an ex- planation but a restatement of the fact (p. 185, 186, 452). He wondered whether those who argued for special creation really believed that at "innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissue" (p. 483). Darwin was trying to suggest that merely using the term "design," however appropri- ate it might be as an expression of faith, leaves un- answered the question of method. In the second edition (ch. 4) he complained that, since no one 194 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1972</page><page sequence="5">4 4 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~16i 8A(Y1O~~ P TUECAVEiS ?VXU 1HDKAN LEA MI'NU.I ]LAIL WiX WOX.ZkYXREi2 Fig. 3. Digging for evidence of Noah's flood: plate 20 from Buckland's Reliquiae Diluvianae (1823). Buckland described the excavations of numerous caves for animal bones in "diluvial" mud (clay) that had supposedly been washed in during the famous catastrophe. This diagram shows an extinct rhinoceros. Buckland discussed in detail how this hapless antediluvian must have been swept in with the diluvial detritus. Other caves contained the bones of hyenas, tigers, bears, wolves, foxes, horses, oxen. and deer, many of them representing extinct species. Animals frequently haunted these caves to feast on imprudent intruders whose bones were left behind for burial and eventual exhumation by eager diluvialists. Lyell (1854, ch. 46) sorted out all the evidence and showed how these bones came to rest by means less dramatic than Noah's flood. objected to gravity, his critics should not erroneously interpret natural selection as an "active power or Deity." Gray soon came to terms with Darwin and became one of his staunchest supporters. He maintained his religious orthodoxy, although the question of design continued to fascinate him. He examined in depth this most complex question in two essays-"Design versus Necessity" and "Natural Selection and Nat- ural Theology"-in which he seemed to conclude that Darwin had eliminated only an inherent, final- istic version of the design argument (Dupree, 1963). This argument states that it is possible for us to observe in nature the only, the final, and the ultimate purpose of the Creator, such as beauty in flowers. In other words, one could just look at a plant and decide what the Almighty had in mind. Moreover, this purpose is the essence and meaning of each organism and structure. If so, then what Darwin had done was to eliminate from biology not the Biblical view of divine providence but Aristotelian final cau- sation as a sufficient and exclusive explanation of biologic events. Value of Religious Thought Today we try to eliminate teleology from a proper description of a biologic event. But we should not gainsay the power of the design argument in the DOCTRINE OF SPECIAL CREATION 195</page><page sequence="6">history of biology, even though it is fashionable in our age to ignore the contributions that religious ideas have made to science in the past. We are more aware of how biology has changed religion (Greene, 1963). Beginning in the 17th century and continuing as late as the opening decades of the 19th century a strong trend in biology, with prominent themes from the Greek past, saw the study of the handiwork of God as a religious responsibility. The works of the Rev. John Ray (1627-1705), the Rev. William Paley (1743-1805), and the Rev. William Buckland (1784-1856) are prototypes of this trend. Whatever its negative aspects-the strong tendency to propa- ganda and the dubious analogy between nature and revelation-it was an energizing force that helped to set in motion the scientific enterprise. When we interpret animal behavior in terms of design (BSOC p. 147) we may only be following a habit we have inherited from Aristotle. And when we add that an animal behaves in such and such a way so as to fulfill the Creator's wish we are impos- ing on nature an a priori view we have derived from religion. Both are legitimate expressions of the sensi- tive mind. Let us give the ancients their due. They remind us that the model of nature put together by modern science may not represent ultimate reality. But we must render to science, also, its due, which is to determine the material connections among contingent events. The trick is to disentangle these components -Aristotelian, religious, and scientific; but this, I think, has not been done in the context of BSOC. I question whether religious truth is served by imply- ing that anthropomorphic final causes, themselves Aristotelian in conceptual origin, may be observed in the operations of nature. Catastrophism BSOC chapters 21 to 25 (unit 9) contain the heart of the authors' argument for special creation. Al- though no doubt they wish this section to be the strongest, yet in some points it is the weakest. There is an unevenness of organization not apparent in the first eight units-as though the authors were not quite sure what arguments would carry the most weight. (Apparently there were no geologists on the writing staff.) The authors argue for the instantaneous creation of the major groups of organisms in the not remote geologic past (p. xix, 398, 416). According to their view of species, all present-day living organisms are lineal descendants of these primordial creatures. There is variability, but this does not denote kinship, for there is no hereditary relatedness between dif- ferent species in time (p. 147, 419, 430, 451). While acknowledging the controversial nature of their view, they hold that it fully supports the ac- count of origins given in Genwesis by Moses. (I shall forego another controversy- the authorship of the Pentateuch-by allowing Moses the priority.) They find evidence for their interpretation in the fossil and geologic record: groups of organisms succeed one another in the rocks, there are no transition fossils, and discontinuities indicate that major changes occurred in the past by geologic agencies no longer in operation (p. 393, 404). Noah's flood was the most important and recent of these agencies (p. 412, 414). Moreover, we are invited to believe that Noah's flood scoured out the Grand Canyon and deposited the fossils in the wake of this swift, paroxysmal convulsion, which engulfed the whole earth (p. 405, 418). Thus, special creation is to the BSOC authors a scientific doctrine; it is more persuasive than the alternative view held by the persons to whom they refer as "evolutionists." Undaunted by more than a century of scholarship in geology and paleontology and a half-century in genetics, they argue that no evolutionary change has occurred in time-for the major groups of organisms were created fully formed, ex nihilo, at the beginning. In short: the chicken came before the egg. Diluvial Geology With unit 9 we are at once back in the first half of the 19th century, when Noah's flood was viewed as a major agent of geologic change. Just as the design argument epitomizes the age-old discussion between science and religion, so catastrophism was the means by which special-creationists usually ac- counted for the changes they were obliged to recog- nize in the past history of the earth. To assess the BSOC authors' point of view we must therefore place it in the context of rapidly shifting concepts in geology and biology during the decades immedi- ately preceding the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, in 1859 (see Gillispie, 1959). The 17th century had seen the dramatic introduc- tion of change and natural law into the hitherto static heavens. During the 18th century, scientists such as George Buffon (1707-88) and James Hutton (1726-97) began to see that change also had char- acterized the earth. When stability and permanence thus gave way to change in time-first in the heav- ens, then on the earth-it was inevitable that the same idea would be applied to living things as well. Soon after the turn of the 19th century diluvial Fig. 4 (opposite). Part of a long diagram Buckland prepared in color to show how the discoveries of geology and paleon- tology substantiated the Biblical account of creation. The diagram is from his Geology and Mineralogy, 1836, vol. 2, plate 1. This book was the sixth Bridgewater Treatise-part of a series commissioned in the 1830s to demonstrate the "Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation." This diagram, despite its Noachian interpretation, illustrates Buckland's substantial geologic knowledge, par- ticularly his command of the layering of strata and their se- quential fossil remains. He included 120 figures of plants and animals, and he identified 30 kinds of sedimentary deposits and eight kinds of unstratified formations, plus dikes, veins, and faults. 196 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1972</page><page sequence="7">YI:.etnJ teilA au- ' 'S M rsv VUI s~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. t ,., S Fe7 WV ,. 43 41~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4t fl^|~ ~ ~ ~ (' *E7 34~~~~~ ~4 As ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i . .......I OF S , ,. * f5 * t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~s</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 5. Skeleton of a "man who witnessed the flood." Since Noah's flood also cleansed Switzerland, reasoned Johann Jacob Scheuzer (1672-1733), physician and fossil hunter, then human bones would have been left behind-although plants, of course, were more worthy of preservation. Success came in 1725, when he dug a skeleton from a quarry; he pre- pared an engraving of it and proclaimed in various publica- tions that he had found "Homo Diluvii Testis." He happily notified the Royal Society of London, which soberly pub- lished his report in the Philosophical Transactions. Far from being an ignorant man, Scheuzer had an interna- tional reputation as a competent naturalist. He made geologic and meteorologic observations, took barometric measure- ments in the Alps, sent scientific notes, as a foreign corres- pondent, to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and published a volume on fossil plants (Jahn, p. 193-213 in Schneer). Scheuzer's story of his "ancient sinner" escaped serious challenge for 100 years until Cuvier, who could tell one skeleton from another, republished Scheuzer's engraving with a complete analysis. We show a portion of one of Cuvier's plates, in which the Scheuzer fossil (fig. 2 and 3, top center and top right) is presented along with fossils of am- phibians. If these bones once belonged to a man who drowned in the flood, what happened to the forehead, Cuvier wanted to know? Why were the eye sockets so large, and where were the teeth? Cuvier showed that it was only an extinct salamander. So much for the "man who witnessed the flood." (Cuvier, Recherches sur les Ossemens Fosales, 3rd ed-, 1825, vol. 6, p. 431-1444, 4th ed. 1836, atlas, vol. 2, plate 253.) geology emerged as a serious attempt to account for very real problems in earth history. In this the Mosaic tradition was a major, but by no means the only, guiding influence. The fossil remains of extinct animals, the curious locations of immovable boulders, and the puzzling features of river valleys all de- manded explanation. Diluvial geology sought to equate a supposed natural event of worldwide scope with a direct, providential intervention. The pro- ponents of this view thought the facts of geologic history might establish the historical reality of the Noachian deluge and so remove any threat to re- ligion posed by geology. There are three scientists whose work may be cited as representative of the period of about 1812-57- the period in which, I believe, the CRS effort may be set. They illustrate, first, the types of problems- the age of the earth, directional change, and causal agencies-that had to be defined before the Dar- winian revolution could be achieved; and, second, the international character of the preliminary solu- tion. Most students of earth history during those years continued to think the earth was comparatively young. They also recognized that the earth must have gone through many changes in the past. They were therefore led to the conclusion that such changes must have been sudden and dramatic. Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) of France gave this view -catastrophism-new prestige, in 1812, with his work on fossil vertebrates, Recherches sur les Osse- mens Fossiles de Quadrupedes. He was sure that within such a short time-interval only a series of violent land-upheavals and paroxysmal deluges could account for the sudden extinction of whole species of animals. The impressive skeletons of mastodons and Megatherium entranced his public. Cuvier also included an engraving of an extinct elephant (see fig. 1) that was once engulfed in Siberian ice-as a result, he thought, of a dramatic drop in temper- ature following a northern extension of a deluge. The BSOC authors refer (p. 404, 406) to this ele- phant as an argument for their view. (Incidentally, this is their only reference to ice.) Cuvier's catastrophism must be set in the context of his impressive and permanent contributions to comparative anatomy. He stated the main argu- ments of this doctrine: a relatively short age of the earth, the progressive and sequential character of the fossil record, and a series of terrestrial parox- ysms. The Creation Research Society should approve of Cuvier. CRS might also approve of the Rev. William Buck- land, an energetic and competent English geologist of the period. His books, including Reliquiae Dilu- vianae [Relics of the Flood], of 1823, are outstanding examples of the catastrophists' attempts to reconcile science with the Bible. He summarized evidence, 198 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1972</page><page sequence="9">from animal bones in caves, that England had been visited by Noah's flood (see fig. 2 and 3). The view offered in BSOC unit 9 reminds me particularly of Buckland's treatise of 1836, in which he argued for a universal deluge, tried to show how the successive fossil record matched the Genesis account, and re- cited evidence everywhere of providential design, including even the coal that insured England's eco- nomic prominence (see fig. 4). However, the authors would probably find Hugh Miller (1802-56) somewhat disconcerting. Also an acute observer and certainly no dilettante, he was not as confident as Buckland. In his Testimony of the Rocks (1857) he devoted two lengthy chapters to "The Noachian Deluge." In these pages he turned a critical eye on the legends and geologic arguments for this supposed event. He rejected the evidence for a universal deluge and argued the folly of sending Noah's flood around the world. He held that Noah's flood was a local event that had occurred somewhere in what is now the Middle East. Buckland's caves had therefore been visited by a flood of much more modest and local proportions. Hugh Miller rather marks the end of the serious 19th-century attempts to equate earth history with Genesis. (In 1954 I visited the site of Ur of the Chaldees, the ancestral home of Abraham [c. 1700 B.C.], in what is now southern Iraq. I stood in the large pit, now partially filled with desert sand, where Charles Leonard Woolley, during his excavations there in 1922-34, found a layer of sediment 2.5 m thick. This was evidence of a large-scale local disaster, which occurred about 3200 B.C. Woolley concluded [1965, p. 29]: "There could be no doubt that the flood of which we had thus found the only possible evidence was the Flood of Sumerian history and legend, the Flood on which was based the story of Noah." Since this flood covered an area of perhaps 645 km by 160 km, it certainly covered "all the high hills" on that flat terrain, which, for the trapped inhabitants, repre- sented "the face of the whole earth" [Genesis 7:19, 8:9].) An even more important publication was the Principles of Geology, in 1830-33 (first edition), by Charles Lyell (1797-1875), whose uniformitarian views the BSOC authors dismiss. More than anyone else in his time, Lyell saw the past in terms of agencies now in operation. Leonard G. Wilson (1967, 1969) has pointed out how Lyell was able to remove the qualitative distinction between the past and the present by a reassessment of these agencies, which include the erosive force of flowing water, the action of volcanoes, and the deposition of sediments. Lyell replaced violence with tranquillity, extended the age of the earth, and thus gave Darwin all the time he needed. This achievement alone is one of two reasons why I find it inconceivable that the BSOC authors, however brave their effort, can now bring about any major redirection of biology-teaching to the conceptual framework of this period before Darwin. In perusing BSOC unit 9 I could not help but think that had the authors consulted these books more fully they might have strengthened their argu- ment and avoided serious pitfalls. From Cuvier and Buckland they might have derived a more coherent argument for diluvialism; by Miller, if not by Lyell, they might have been warned to steer clear of Noah's flood altogether. For instance, I find it difficult to understand, on BSOC p. 405, the ingenious explana- tion of why the remains of the complex animals are found higher in rock strata than are the less complex. Apparently the more complex, such as an elephant, though of considerable weight, would have swum to the top during Noah's flood, whereas the simpler, such as lizards, though lighter in weight, would have plummeted to the bottom. I can find nothing like it in the writings of either Buckland or Miller. Further- more: If Noah's flood scoured out the Grand Canyon, would CRS be able to find for us marks of this flood on say, the upper slopes of Mt. Whitney, or perhaps on Mt. Hood? After all, "the mountains were covered" (Genesis 7:20). But Lyell did not find that such a single devastation could account for the present or past characteristics of the Mississippi valley, which he visited in 184546 (Lyell, 1849, II, ch. 34). If he was correct, how then could the flood account for the Grand Canyon-much less any changes at higher elevation? Footprint Hoaxes On BSOC p. 417418 we are told of alleged foot- prints of large men who lived with dinosaurs in Texas and with trilobites in Utah. These tracks are supposed to substantiate the Genesis 6:4 account of "giants in the earth." Keith Young, professor of geology at the University of Texas at Austin, has informed me (letter, 24 May 1971) that on several visits to the Glen Rose, Texas, location he has never seen, nor has he been shown, such "human" foot- prints, though there are dinosaur tracks to be seen there. Moreover, he observes that the published pic- tures of "human" tracks show no pressure points as the result of walking, whereas the dinosaur tracks do show the flow of mud as the animal shifted its footing when walking; there is no narrowing of the "human" instep; and the "human" tracks are chis- elled evenly, whereas the dinosaur tracks, made in soft mud, show deformation due to the rolling-in of the mud. As for the "human-like sandal print" at Delta, Utah: R. A. Robison, professor of geology at the Uni- versity of Utah, has informed me (letter, 1 June 1971) that the supposed "footprint" has probably resulted from a fracture pattern that commonly oc- curs in certain sedimentary layers there. Moreover, the "footprint" occurs in company with trilobites, DOCTRINE OF SPECIAL CREATION 199</page><page sequence="10">brachiopods, and echinoderms-creatures of the ocean, which is a strange habitat indeed for ante- diluvian man. William Buckland and Hugh Miller, who were among the ablest geologists of the 19th century, routinely distinguished between marine and fresh- water sediments and between fossils and artefacts. They would have been quite able to recognize a hoax when they saw one. For a similar misreading of the rocks see fig. 5. Geographic Distribution The BSOC authors ought to have had another look at Louis Agassiz (1807-73), who always opposed evolution. His Studies on Glaciers, first published in 1840 in French, is now available in a splendid English edition (1967). Agassiz' ice displaced a con- siderable amount of diluvial mud from 19th-century thought by accounting for peculiar events that really had occurred in the recent geologic past, such as the transportation of those boulders. Lyell, and even Buckland, soon incorporated Agassiz' views into their own (Lyell, 1854, p. 154, 155, ch. 15; Rudwick, p. 151). I should now like to ask: how would CRS account for the present existence of alpine plants high in the Rocky Mountains, if presumably they all had per- ished in Noah's flood? Since they cannot live on the warm valley floor, are we to believe that they were created where they are now found at the conclusion of Noah's flood? If so, that would be an addition to the Genesis account of creation. We are told (BSOC p. 416, 457) that the longevity of such organisms as the opossum and Lingula, with apparently no change through millions of years, is an argument against evolution. A reasonable expla- nation might also be that they had encountered no substantial competition within their particular eco- logic niches. But I am now wondering: why is the longevity of the opossum not an argument against the CRS position, if all creatures perished, save those in the ark? Hugh Miller, whose piety we should not doubt, remarked (1857, p. 347) that if all living animals are descendants of passengers in the ark, then they would have had to be ferried across the Atlantic by a miracle not recorded by Moses, not to mention the initial journey to safety. The geographic distribution of living organisms is scarcely mentioned in the CRS book and is one of the major weaknesses in unit 9. And no wonder: it was the examination of this question, to which Agassiz' ice provided so useful an insight, that brought about a further substantial modification of the special-creation doctrine in the 1850s (Aulie, 1970a). The BSOC authors miss the important rela- tionships among extinction, adaptation, and distribu- tion-relationships resolved by Darwin partly by the use of ideas supplied by these early 19th-century in- vestigators. Catastrophism sought to maintain a short time- span for the earth by accounting for observable changes in terms of sudden convulsions. Lyell length- ened the age of the earth by arguing effectively for gradual, long-term changes. Those persons who today are drawn to the former view ought to weigh the arguments put forward in Lyell's Principles of Geology. It is Lyell, not Darwin, whose monumental achievement remains a challenge to the reestablish- ment of this 19th-century doctrine by the Creation Research Society.
