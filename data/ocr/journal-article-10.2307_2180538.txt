<plain_text><page sequence="1">SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT' I. SLAVERY IN PLATO S POLITICAL THEORY A FORMAL discussion of slavery is nowhere to be found in Plato. We must reconstruct his views from a few casual statements. The most important of these is a simile in the Laws (720), where Plato contrasts the free physician in attendance upon freemen with the slave healer of slaves. The free medical man "investigates the origin and the nature of the disease;2 he enters into community with the patient and with his friends." He is essentially a teacher, but a teacher who also learns from the sick. He gives no autocratic orders, but educates the pa- tient into health. Slaves, ,on the other hand, are incapable of such reasonable intercourse. The slave doctor's visit is hurried. He "neither gives a servant any rational account (logos) of his complaint, nor asks him for any; he gives an order based on empirical belief (doxa) with the air of exact knowledge, in the insolent manner of a tyrant, then jumps off to the next ailing servant."3 Elsewhere (Laws 773e), discussing the proper treat- ment of slaves, Plato sums up the matter in these words: "One must punish slaves justly, not spoiling them by admonition as though they were freemen."4 And in another context: "Well then, should they discern this, but be unable to give any ra- tional demonstration of it?-Impossible. The state of mind you describe is that of a slave" (Laws 966b). It is clear from such passages that Plato thinks of the slave's condition as a deficiency of reason. He has doxa, but no logos. He can have true belief, but cannot know the truth of his be- lief.' He can learn by experience (empeiria) and external pre- scription (epitaxes). But he can neither give nor follow a rational account. He is therefore susceptible to persuasion."

The weakness of doxa, even of true doxa, is that it can be changed.7 Only knowledge is stable (monimos), for he who knows has direct contact with the im- mutable Forms.8 This is what the slave lacks. His experience cannot yield true knowledge.9 In all matters of truth he is, therefore, unconditionally subject to his intellectual superiors. Now it is an axiom of Plato's political theory that the only one fit to rule is he who possesses logos.'0 The good ruler must rule for the good of the state. He can only do this if he knows the form of the Good, and then uses the necessary "persuasion and coercion" to order the state accordingly." Thus govern- ment is good for the governed,'2 but does not require their con- on the way this is done. "Persuasion", as ordinarily used in English, ties one down to some kind of intellectual, or, at least, rhetorical, process. You cannot persuade without some kind of argument, though it may be fallacious argu- ment. But Plato can write 3tcaoKXXovs 1rE7reretowevovs joto-0os (Laws 804d) without straining the word. Cf. &amp;3pa Owbs bretOlE (quoted in Rep. 39oe). In Greek usage peitho often stands for "bribe". 7 Meno 98a. Plato's educational system aspires to dye the right beliefs into the soul like fast colors into wool. But even fast colors fade. The ultimate guar- antee of the stability of the state is not in the early precautions to make the guardians' good convictions proof against persuasion, oblivion, beguilement of pleasure and pressure of fear (Rep. 413bc); it is the guardians' eventual ac- quaintance with the unalterable Good. 8 E.g., Rep. 532a. "Direct" means here "through reason without the media- tion of the senses". 9 It may be asked: What of the slave-boy in the Meno? Socrates confidently asserts (85e) that what the boy has done in this instance he could do "in the whole of geometry and in all other lessons". But what has he done in this in- stance? Socrates makes each successive point so plain that only a half-wit could miss it. Plato never suggested that slaves are stupid. He only says that they lack logos or nous and cannot apprehend the Forms. One may lack logos yet be a paragon of empiric acuteness (e.g., Rep. 5i 6c; and 5 iga Trv X eyogJ cvwv Vroz'qpLWv pbv, oo/xwv 6e, 's Aptgb RAv f3XkMret X qvxAptov. . .). At the end of the encoun- ter the slave-boy has not discovered the Form "square", "diameter", etc. Socrates gives the pieces of the puzzle and keeps prodding and correcting until the boy has fitted them properly together. The boy then has the answer to this particular problem, but no grasp of the underlying general truth. He knows the true solution, but not why it is true. Nevertheless I should not conclude that Plato thinks that this slave-boy could not discover the Forms. This point is left undetermined. But, if the slave-boy could master the Forms, then he ought not to be a slave. In a "true" (i.e., Platonic) state he would be a philosopher, and therefore at the top, not the bottom, of the social pyramid. 10 E.g., Laws g68a: The highest magistrate "must be able to give a rational account (logos) of all that admits of a rational account". Otherwise he cannot be a "fit ruler of the whole state, but only a servant to other rulers". 11 Rep. si 8b-e. The phrase iretOo Kac d1a occurs often in the Laws. 12 E.g., Socrates' argument against Thrasymachus in the Republic, I, main- taining that government is for the benefit of the governed.</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 29I sent.'3 A democratically minded theorist like Protagoras'4 holds that all men have a sense of "reverence and justice"; that they all share in the "political art"."15 Plato denies this flatly: "Does it seem at all possible that a multitude in a state could ever acquire this [sc. political] science?-By no means" (Polit. 292e, Fowler's tr.). Hence anything like a contract theory of the state strikes Plato as a pernicious error.'6 How can men who do not know the nature of justice establish a just state by common agreement? The only way to get justice is to recognize the fact that "some men are by nature fitted to embrace philosophy and lead in the state, while others are unfit to embrace it and must follow the leader" (Rep. 474c; cf. Laws 69ob). It follows that the absence of self-determination, so striking in the case of the slave, is normal in Platonic society. The fully enlightened aristocrats are a small minority of the whole popula- tion (e.g., Pouit. 292e). All the rest are in some degree douloi in Plato's sense of the word: they lack logos; they do not know the Good, and cannot know their own good or the good of the state: 13 Potit. 293a, 2962-297b. This point is all the more remarkable because it contrasts sharply with the conception of government which underlies the Crito. There Socrates thinks and acts as a responsible member of a free republic. It is because he has himself consented to the laws that they are binding upon him: lrapcp TaS twaVOKcas Te Kal opuoXowylas (52d); VOt*Kas nds irpbs Jpas irapacla3s (54c). However, it would not be impossible to find a casuistic reconciliation of political obligation that rests upon consent with political authority that is above con- sent. Plato's point, I suppose, would be that the good ruler's commands must be obeyed, consent or no consent; though if his subjects knew the Good as he knows it (a hypothesis which would abolish the distinction between subject and ruler in the Republic and the Politicus), they would gladly give their con- sent. 14 It is significant that Pericles entrusted him with the framing of the consti- tution of Thourioi. 15 Prot. 322c, d. It is suggestive to compare Protagoras' myth with the myth of thePoliticusandthe comparable passage in Laws 73b Iff. In the former the setting is man's struggle for self-preservation: Prometheus'gift of fire and Hermes' gift of "reverence and justice" put into man's hands the two weapons that enable him to succeed. Plato's aristocratic counterblast changes the setting so as to ab- stract entirely from the principle of human self-reliance and self-help. It harks back to the age of Cronos where there is no struggle with nature (Iravra ah6- aTra ytyyeoOca&amp; ToSs &amp;vapcOProos, PoWt. 27id; &amp;,s 4b-0ov&amp; TE Kac abr6/.aTa Prava JFe, Laws, 7I 3c), and where man's social life is directly under the care of divine be- ings (the "divine shepherd" of the Politicus, the "daemons" of the Laws). Here reverence and justice (Laws, 7I3e) are not the condition, but the product, of good government; and good government means not self-government but gov- ernment of the inferior by the superior, of the mortal by the divine. 16 Rep. 359a, Laws 8894: that justice rests on agreement is mentioned as part of a dangerous view, destructive of morality and religion. Yet the idea of law as aVVOJKo was so widespread that it invaded even the thought of its opponents: e.g., Plato himself (Crito 52d, 54c, cited above) and Aristotle (see Bonitz, Index, 729b 53).</page><page sequence="4">292 THE PHILQSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. L. their only chance of doing the good is to obey implicitly the commands of their superiors. Thus Plato speaks currently of subjection to the reasonable discipline of rulers, human and divine, laws, parents, and elders as servitude (douleuein, dou- leia).17 This usage is not without precedent. But Plato goes further in this direction than any earlier writer. It had been the proud boast of Aeschylus for his fellow-countrymen: "They can- not be called the slaves of any man" (Pers. 242). It is hard to find an instance in fifth-century literature where douleia is used, as Plato uses it, in the sense of virtuous, amicable, and cheerful submission to constituted authority, without any of the grim associations of duresse and dishonor. Yet Plato's genial extension of the word to cover an honorable and even fortunate estate is amply justified by the premises of his own thought: The manual laborer, for example, is "weak by nature in the principle of the best". Left to himself, he could not rule himself, but would be ruled by his appetites. What happier solution could there be than servitude to one who is strong in the principle of the best, "so that we may all be equals and friends so far as possible, all governed by the same principle"?" When Plato speaks so innocently of the artisans of the Re- public as the "slaves" of the philosophers, he certainly does not mean to be taken literally.19 He neither means to degrade all artisans to the level of bondmen, nor to raise the social status of 17 Laws 698bc, 700a, 7oIb, 7I5d, 762e, 839c, 89oa. For some of these refer- ences, and for much else in this paper, I am indebted to G. R. Morrow's "Plato and Greek Slavery", Mind, April, I939. 18 Rep. 59ocd. (Jowett blurs the point by translating "servant" for doulos, much as King James' translators often render "servant" for doulos: e.g., Matthew 2o: 27, Mark IO: 44, Gal. 4: I, Eph. 6: 5. Lindsay's translation is more exact.) This passage has never received the attention it deserves. Bosanquet is the only exception I know. He sees that "this is the essential basis of Aristotle's explanation ... of slavery", and accepts it in principle: "Plato's general ac- count of the spiritual relation of society to inferior or immature minds, and in some degree to all minds, is unimpeachable" (Companion to Plato's Republic, ad loc.). I suppose that in terms of Bosanquet's political theory the philosopher would express the "real will" of the doulos. Hegel is more sophisticated on this point. See his stricture on Platonic philosophy: "the principle of subjective freedom does not receive its due" (Philosophy of Right, tr. by Dyde, par. i85 note. Cf. M. B. Foster, The Political Philosophies of Plato and Hegel, Ch. iii). But it is significant that Hegel does not criticize Plato for his denial of the ob- jective freedom of the working classes. Hegel's own political theory would hardly entitle him to make this criticism. 19 As mistaken, for example, by W. L. Newman, The Politics of Aristotle, I, I09- I0, in a valuable reference to this passage, suggesting that this was "per- haps the source from which Aristotle derived his theory of natural slavery".</page><page sequence="5">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 293 the slave to that of the free laborer. There is not the slightest indication, either in the Republic,20 or anywhere else, that Plato means to obliterate or relax in any way that distinction. The very opposite is the case. Professor Morrow's admirable recent study has shown that Plato's law of slavery is not more but less liberal than current Attic law; and in one important respect less liberal than any known slave legislation of classical antiquity.2' Then what is the point of speaking so freely of all sorts and con- ditions of political subordinates as douloi? The point is not practical, but theoretical. It underlines the fact that, in prin- ciple, there is no difference in Plato's political theory between the relation of a master to his slave and of a sovereign to his subjects; or, as Aristotle put this Platonic doctrine: that "mastership (despoteia), statesmanship (politike) and kingship (basilike) are the same thing".22 In other words, Plato uses one and the same principle to inter- pret (and justify) political authority and the master's right to govern the slave, political obligation and the slave's duty to obey his master. His conception of all government archer , archein) is of a piece with his conception of the government of slaves. Is this saying too much? One thinks of any number of important qualifications.23 Yet substantially the statement is true. One need only refer to the Politicus for the explicit state- ment that there is no other difference between the art of slaveowner despots&amp;, 259b 7) and king (basilikos, 259C 2) than the size of their respective establishments. Whatever be the refinements of such a theory, it appears at once as a radical denial of democracy. It could no more account for the facts of democratic government in Athens, than the contract theorists could account for the fact of slavery. The 20 See Rep. 469bc. (For barbarian slaves in the Republic see 47ib and cf. with 469b.) It is when aristocracy deteriorates that the free producers are enslaved in the literal sense (547c). 21 "Plato and Greek Slavery", Mind, April, I939. See pp. i94-198, and es- pecially p. i96. For a more detailed discussion see the same author's Plato's Law of Slavery (University of Illinois Press, I939). 22 Pol. I 253b i8; I252a, 8. That this is Plato's view is clear from Polit. 2sgbc. 23 It would be superfluous to detail these here. They are obvious to any reader of the Republic and the Laws, and I should not wish to belittle them. See especially Rep. 547c. All I am suggesting here is that Plato uses one and the same principle to interpret (and justify) authority in the case of both master and statesman and obedience in the case of both slave and subject.</page><page sequence="6">294 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. L. contract theorists generalized the government of the state by the demos for the demos. They verged into idealism at the point where they would substitute "man" for "citizen of Athens"; at that point they did not know what to do with slavery, and played with the subversive view that slavery was unnatural.24 Plato, generalizing the government of slave by master, was forced into the opposite conclusion that democracy was un- natural. Plato idealized the institution of slavery; the contract theorists the institution of democracy. Their conflicting ideal- ism mirrored the real contradiction in Athenian society: a free political community that rested on a slave economy. II. SLAVERY IN PLATO S COSMOLOGY Can we detect any higher overtones of the master-slave rela- tion? Can we trace it in wholes of a different order than political society: in the human microcosm and the physical macrocosm? One's attention is drawn in this direction by Plato's frequent references to the body as the "slave" of the soul. That this is no mere figure of speech, but is meant to convey a serious philosophical truth, is clear from three considerations. (i) It stands as a formal premise in a metaphysical argument for the immortality of the soul in the Phaedo.25 (ii) It is written into the physiology of the Timaeus.26 (iii) It determines leading ideas 24 Contract could only be the thinnest of disguises for force, on which slavery so obviously rested (see Poi. i255a 5 ff.). To base slavery on agreement was to suggest the view that this agreement was unnatural and slavery invalid. How many of the contract theorists shared this view? We do not know. In the Politics (I 253b 2i) Aristotle does not name his opponents who flatly maintained that slavery is conventional and contrary to nature. See Gorg. 484ab for Cal- licles' view that "natural justice" may be violated by slavery. Antiphon, the sophist, undercuts the distinction between noble and low birth, between Greek and barbarian ~red 4bace rairra'racrres'V1oicos ire kace' (Diels, B, 44, Fr. B, col. 2). The same principle would undercut slavery. Alcidamas, the pupil and successor of Gorgias, is said to have declared: "God left all men free; nature made no one a slave" (Schol. on Rhet. I373b, i8). And a fragment of Philemon, the comic poet (ed. Meineke, Fr. 39), runs: "Though one be a slave, he has the same flesh; / By nature no one was ever born a slave." 2' 7ge-8oa. It is the necessary link in the analogy of the soul to the "divine" and of the body to the "mortal": "in the order of nature" the body and the mortal are both the slaves of their respective masters, the soul and the divine. 26 In the head, whose spherical form copies the shape of the universe, is placed "the divinest and holiest part" (452a), which is "lord (eo-Iroro0v) of all that is in us" (44d). The rest of the body is made to serve (4 Kac rirv rT oacta rap~3ooav beriopeocav acdr4): it is a vehicle (6xrnlka) for the head, supplementing the soul's two "divine revolutions" (44d) with the "six wandering motions" (44d8; cf. 43b). The "mortal" part of the soul is housed apart "for fear of polluting the divine part" (69d); the neck was built as "an isthmus and boun- dary to keep the two apart" (69e).</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 295 in Plato's ethics.27 Each of these matters deserves detailed dis- cussion. But to keep this paper within reasonable limits, I pro- ceed at once to Plato's application of the slave-metaphor beyond anthropology to cosmology itself. Let us begin with the scene in the Phaedo where the Platonic Socrates explains that he turned away from Ionian physics, because it did not use the right method. The right method, suggested by Anaxagoras' nous, but, alas, not followed by this unregenerate Ionian, is defined in the following terms: "If you wish to find the cause of anything . . ,you must find out this about it: How it is best for it to exist or be acted upon or act in any other way" (97cd). Thus a scientific explanation of the shape and position of the earth must prove that it has that particular shape and position because these are "best" for it (97e). To back this unusual view of scientific method the Platonic Socrates resorts to an analogy: What is the cause of my presence in this prison? It is not bones and sinews that keep me here, but my decision that this is for the best (99b). Physiology is not the "real" cause (Iro artoz'vr43 5Vlrt), but only an indispensable condi- tion (E'KElhO hivev oB r6o a'lruwv OK hip wor' d'lt a'ltov, 99c). Without apology this argument is transferred from the human organism to the universe at large. The reasoning takes it for granted that teleology and mechanism are related in the world-order as mind to body in man himself. But since the relation of mind to body has already been conceived as analogous to that of master to slave, it would follow that the relation of teleology to mechan- ism can also be so conceived: that the mechanical cause, mis- takenly accepted by the Ionians as the "ruling" cause, is actually only a "slave" cause. This, of course, is so far only an inference. But if we follow the development of Plato's thought 27 In the beginning of Laws v, the whole rationale of virtue is reduced to these terms: "A man's own nature consists invariably of two kinds of elements: the stronger and better are lordly (3eair6oovra) the weaker and worse are slaves (6oiXa); wherefore one must ever honour the lordly above the slavish elements in one's nature" (726). That is, honor the soul above the body and its pleasures and passions. In the Republic intemperance is described as insubordination of the appetites against the order of reason. It is "a meddlesomeness and inter- ference and rebellion of one part of the soul against the whole to gain a rule to which it has no right; that part indeed whose nature is such that it ought to be slave, while the other should never be slave, but ruler" (following Lindsay's translation of 444b, except after the semicolon, where he takes rotobrov o'ros 4baet to refer to T4&gt; Myip instead of pukpovs rtL6s). Similar expression in 442ab.</page><page sequence="8">296 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. L. in the later dialogues we shall find that this is exactly the direc- tion in which it moves. Physical variables, like hot and cold, dry and moist, which play such an important role in early Ionian thought, appear in the Philebus under the category of the measureless.28 Lacking in order, this realm of being would be full of hybris and evil (26b), were measure not imposed upon it29 by a creative agent.30 This is the cause (ro a'lrtfv, 26e): the very category that Socrates missed in the Jonians. It is the ordering nous of Anaxagoras now taken in good earnest and assigned to its proper place as "king of heaven and earth" (28c). The other principle is its slave: "slave to the cause (boLoueioV a1tlr) for the purpose of generation" (27a). In the Timaeus the whole account of man and the world turns on a clear-cut distinction between two kinds of causes: (i) the "primary" cause, which is "intelligent", "divine", and productive of all that is "fair and good" ;31 (2) The "secondary" cause, which is "necessary", irrational, fortuitous and disorderly.32 The modern reader must find something baffling about this blend of necessity with chance in the secondary cause. For us the very idea of necessity implies necessary order.33 How con- ceive of necessary disorder without self-contradiction?34 28 25d: To A&amp;retpov opposite of rT 7reparoet6ks and of rT 9,ggerpoV Kcal o1bgerpov (26a 6, 7). 29 Note the force of hir' rtoots (30c 5). 30 rT 3,gtovpyo'VV (27b), ra rotoVV (27a), e rol) rOtOVVTOs Obaos (26e). 3ras rTls gpopovos Obaews alTLlas rp&amp;Tas (46d), 6oTaL yerT&amp; VOV KaXWV Kal &amp;ya&amp;ov 511MOVpTOL (46e), Td Sta vov (47e), TO' GtoV (68e). 32 aV&amp;'yKfl (48a), e r'fs 6,V&amp;PKfS &amp; 0K-t&amp;S (56c), Td AvayKcalov (68e), Ta S AVAPKfWS (47e); Toat /LovwdoE~atc 4povh-ews TO TvXcv ATraKTov ktepya&amp;tovaTc (46e). Cf. with this last Phil. 28d 6, 7. B3 In the ensuing discussion I am not speaking of Plato's concept of necessity as a whole. I am excluding from the discussion logical necessity. Like everyone else, Plato identifies this with rational order. He uses constantly &amp;V&amp;ycn, &amp;va'yKaTov, etc. to mark the cogency and evidence of a deductive conclusion (e.g., Gorg. 475a-c; Phaedo gie; Phil. 40c; Tm 53c). This kind of ananke is at the other extreme from the ananke of the secondary cause. Logical necessity is explicitly opposed to verisimilitude (Theait. 062e), while verisimilitude is the characteristic mood of all discourse about the material world (Tm 29c; and 53d KalT TrP Iver' AV&amp;YKfS eLK6Tra cX6yov). This bifurcation of ananke into formal order and material disorder is conserved by Aristotle. His view is tersely stated and acutely discussed by D. M. Balme in the Class. Quarterly, Oct., I939: "Ananke does not govern sequences: there is no transeunt causality inherent in the material", p. I30. 34 In Plato's Cosmology (i62 ff.) F. M. Cornford throws some light on this problem. He points out that to Plato, as to Aristotle, chance does not mean the</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 297 I can think of one clue: "The ideas of douleia and ananke", writes George Thomson, "are almost inseparable in Greek, the word ananke being constantly used to denote both the state of slavery as such, and also the torture to which the slaves were subjected."3" No one, so far as I know, has ever thought of interpreting the ananke of the Timaeus on the pattern of slavery. Yet Plato speaks of material necessity as a "servant" (v7r-iperoiv'W, 46c 7; v'rqpeTovoaas, 68e 4) who, he also tells us, is "incapable of any logos or nous about anything" (46d 4). But this, as we have seen, is the defining concept of the slave: a servant destitute of logos. Here, I think, is the explanation we need. The idea of "disorderly necessity" strikes us as a flat self- contradiction because we think of necessity in terms of a mechanical instrument, whose motions follow a strict mechan- ical order; that order is inherent in the instrument, and we can only use the instrument in so far as we respect its order. Plato thinks of necessity in terms of a "living instrument", whose use does not seem to depend on our understanding of its own in- trinsic order, but rather on our ability to "persuade" it to follow our own purpose. In this case the order does not seem to be in the instrument but in us. This is the very image that occurs to Aristotle when he pictures the teleological order of the universe: "But it is as in a house, where the freemen are least at liberty to act at random, but all things or most things are already ordered for them, while the slaves and the beasts do little for the com- mon good, for the most part live at random".36 The slave does not share of his own accord the order of the common life. Left to himself he would "wander" off into disorder.37 Order, which opposite of necessity, but the opposite of purpose. Thus a "necessary accident" means to both any unintended, but unavoidable, circumstance involved in the execution of a plan. This does explain the element of compulsion in ananke. But it does not explain the element of disorder. 36 The ORESTEIA of Aeschylus, II, 345, (Cambridge, I938). The association of the two words follows naturally from their obvious meaning. Aristotle defines ananke (in the sense of compulsion: riv yap 9wAev ApX2iv, riv irapa riv 6pguiv j krodlov6oav O KLWOVoavc, 6V&amp;?yKfV XkYO0teV (Nic. Eth.

L. he could not originate himself, must be imposed upon him, pre- ferably by persuasion or, failing this, by coercion. The Demiurge, being the wisest of masters, need not resort to coercion at all: he "persuades necessity" (48a 2) and makes it his "willing" slave (56c, 5). The notion of "persuading necessity" and the implied idea of "compelling necessity" make sense only if one keeps steadily in mind the slave metaphor. Persuading the law of gravitation does not make sense. Persuading a slave does. To appreciate the importance of this development one must see it in historic perspective. The slave metaphor occurs at the very point where Plato turns consciously away from the cosmo- logy of his predecessors.38 From the very beginnings of Ionian thought rational and immanent necessity had been an integral feature of the concept of nature. Recall, for example, the saying of Anaximander that things come into existence and perish "as it is ordained; for they make satisfaction and reparation to one another for their injustice according to the order of time."39 To express natural necessity this early Milesian borrows words from the government of man. But that is, of course, no more than what we must still do to-day when we speak of the "laws" of nature. What is important is rather the absence of any sug- gestion of a superior agency to issue ordinances and enforce reparations. On the contrary, Anaximander excludes the inter- vention of a superior order upon the course of nature by endow- ing nature itself with the attributes of divinity: it is infinite, immortal, indestructible.40 Thinkers as opposed to one another consistency Plato is true to this feature of the slave-metaphor, maintaining that the primordial chaos had crude "traces" of the elegant order that the Demiurge was to impress upon it at creation: riv zyevkcews rTO2vqfv iypatvogkuwv Kal 7rvpov/kuJVf Ka Tra's y's TE Kal 6ppos Iuopas 86exoi,.kV V, Kal 6Ta &amp;XXa TOrTOts 7r&amp;1 owvbarerat mr&amp;caxovo-av (Tm 52de). The last clause is particularly important, for it recognizes an order of causal implication before the chaos had been "in- formed with shapes and numbers" (53b). Yet Plato can only explain causal implication through the Forms: e.g., the necessary connection between fire and heat, snow and cold (Phaedo Io3C ff.). As P. H. DeLacy has recently put it: "Plato finds no causal relation on the purely physical level. The Ideas are the causes of the qualities of physical objects, for the qualities of particulars exist only in so far as particulars participate in Ideas" (Class. Phil., April, I939). This is part of a larger contradiction in Plato's thought which I have noted in "The Disorderly Motion in the Timaios", p. 76-7, Class. Quarterly, April, I939. 38 See W. H.

Some verbal expressions may suggest the opposite. But a closer examination shows how firmly they adhere to the notion of autonomous nature. When Heraclitus says, for example, "The sun will not overstep his measures (metra) else the Erinyes, the assistants of Justice, will find him out" Justice and the Erinyes stand for no independent entity; they simply express the inevitability of the pattern that fire follows in its unceasing transformations, "kindled in measure (metra), and extinguished in measure".42 Likewise when Par- menides writes, "strong ananke keeps it in the bonds of the limit",43 ananke is neither superior nor inferior to the inflexible rationality of existence, but simply identical with it. In the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus this trend of thought comes to full maturity: "Nothing occurs at random, but everything for a reason (ek logou) and by necessity."44 Here is the exact opposite of Plato's doctrine: logos and ananke are coupled together; material necessity is rational and it excludes chance.45 The inherent motion of matter which seems to Plato the source of necessary disorder is in the eyes of Democritus the very meaning of necessary order.46 And because it is neces- sary, motion is coeval with matter itself. There is no need for a "first cause" to set matter in motion.47 This was the final blow at the anthropomorphic theory of creation. Its consequences, writes Cyril Bailey, "were momentous. In the sphere of physical 41 This connection of Parmenides with Anaximander was suggested to me by Werner Jaeger's remark: "he also calls it [sc. ananke] dike or Moira, obviously under Anaximander's influence", Paideia, Eng. tr., p.

A question might arise over B, 4I: "the thought (gnome) which steers (&amp;KVJ3pvlo-e) all things through all things." Is this governing thought an extraneous superior factor? Clearly not, if one compares B, 64, "the thunder- bolt that steers (olaKirt) the course of all things" with B, 66: "Fire in its ad- vance will judge and convict all things" (Burnet's tr. following Diels): the "thought" is inherent in the fire; like "justice" above, simply another expres- sion for the relentless orderliness of fire. 43 Diels, B, 30 1.

L. speculation it introduced for the first time the possibility of a strictly scientific conception of the world."48 Why was it that Plato chose to frustrate this possibility in his cosmology?49 It would be presumptuous to attempt to answer this question within the limits of this paper. But the answer, whatever it be, must reckon with this fact: Plato attacks Ionian physics not only on philosophical, but also on political grounds; so that both the political and the cosmological associations of slavery came into play in his polemic. The issue is the very existence of a philosophy which conceives of the government of the state and the government of the world as analogous to the government of the slave. The locus classicus for this attack is the tenth book of the Laws. His opponents are the "modern scientists" (886d; also 888e ff.). He imputes to them not only mechanistic cosmology, but also the contract theory of the state.50 The first gives rise to the second, and each to atheism. The basic error is the idea that physical bodies "are moved by the interplay of their respective forces, according as they meet together and combine fittingly" (889b, Bury's tr.); in other words, that nature is a self-regulating system, and is not governed by the art of a divine mind. This implies that the stars are products of a natural process, not gods, but inanimate material bodies (886de; 889b). It implies further that legislation (like every other art) is a late product of the same process, so that laws are not absolute commands, but man-made agreements (889c-8goe). Instead of deriving the laws 48 Op. cit., I22. 49 Aristotle is often blamed for importing teleology into physics. The real culprit, of course, is Plato. Aristotle thinks as a Platonist when he repudiates the all-but-universal belief of his predecessors in natural necessity (Phys. i98b 2; de part. Anim. 639b 2i). It was Plato who had led the attack on the Ionian mechanists, foisting on them his own assumption that material necessity is equivalent to chance, and thus forcing them into the absurd position of denying the de facto order of the universe because they will not grant the existence of telelogical order. This misconception which vitiates the argument for final causes in Phys. ii. viii had been anticipated in the Philebus (28d-29e) and Laws X. 50 How easily this point may be missed is clear from A. E. Taylor's para- phrase of this passage (in the Introduction to his translation of the Laws, lii): "Plato's view is that atheism is the product of two historical factors,,the cor- porealism of the early Ionian men of science .. ., and the 'sophistic' theory of the purely conventional and relative character of moral distinctions." But the text says nothing about "two historical factors". It is the same people (the (ooot &amp;dvpes of 888e) whose cosmology is expounded in 889b-d and whose poli- tics is given in 889d-8goa.</page><page sequence="13">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 301 from the gods, this impious view derives the gods from the laws, and variable laws at that. To refute all this Plato maintains that the soul is the first cause of all physical motions. His elaborate argument need not be examined here. We need only note that the point of his thesis is to prove that the soul, being "older" than the body, has the right to "rule" the body." And what he means by the soul's "rule" is clear from a parallel passage in the Timaeus (34c): soul is despotis; it rules the body as master rules slave. If he can prove this, Plato feels he has destroyed Ionian materialism. He can then have everything his own way: that soul or souls direct every bodily motion (896de); that the stars have soul or souls and are divine (898d-899b); and that, in short, "all things are full of gods" (899b). Thus cosmology supports religion by estab- lishing the existence of its gods.52 And the link between religious cosmology and political religion is the slave-metaphor. III. PLATO AND ARISTOTLE Any discussion of Plato's views on slavery invites comparison with the most famous text of antiquity on this topic: the first book of the Politics. Aristotle's polemic is mainly directed against those who hold that slavery is contrary to nature." The word "nature" is used here in at least three senses: a moral, a biological, and a cosmological one. The first states the demon- strandum of Aristotle's argument; the latter two decide the demonstration. To prove: that slavery is natural, in the sense of being good and just:54 good for the master, to whom it provides a necessary instrument (I253b 23 ff.); good also for the slave,55 whose intellectual deficiency is supplemented by the master's superior reason.6 This is proved first by the contention that the 51 E.g., 892a: [tpvxh] (bs v rp&amp;rotpOLS EaTn Ut&amp;TCoJV, 9inipo-Oezv w&amp;J'Twv 'yevolue'vnv, whence it is assumed by a simple conjunction (xat) that it rules every bodily change. The inference from superior age to the right to rule is made explicit in Tm 34c. 52 The "gods according to the laws": 885b, 89oab, 904a. Serious confusion results when this limitation is not recognized. Laws x does not even attempt to prove the existence of the Demiurge, who is never mentioned among the official divinities. 53 7rapad 4sov rcd beo-r66etv, I253b 20. 54 #rXtOVJ KitX 8icaLOv, I254a i8. 4so VL baiXOL ots PAVrL6 (TTLV ApXEGOaL TanjJv rt1v aipxhv, I 245b i 9. 56 I252a 3V; cf.

L. difference of master and slave, commensurate with that of soul and body or of man and beast (I254b I7), is a congenital one: "some things are marked out from the moment of birth to rule or to be ruled" (I254a 23). This is the part of Aristotle's argu- ment that has given greatest offence to posterity and thus attracted widest attention. Yet no less important in Aristotle's eyes is the metaphysical sanction of slavery. The difference be- tween master and slave, he holds, is natural because it follows a pattern that pervades all nature: "because in every composite thing, where a plurality of parts, whether continuous or dis- crete, is combined to make a single common whole, there is always found a ruling and a subject factor, and this character- istic of living things is present in them as an outcome of the whole of nature (4K r Sa air~oS 4vTEWS)."57 Now let us ask: What is there in this argument that Plato too could not have said in full consistency with his own ideas about slavery? It is, of course, the A B C of exegesis to distinguish between what a writer has actually said and what he could have said or ought to have said. That the Platonic dialogues give us no equivalent to the first book of the Politics points to a difference of temper between Plato's and Aristotle's views which must not be minimized. Nevertheless when we have made full allowance for this difference, we must still observe a fact which has escaped the notice of many modern interpreters and might modify their conclusions about Plato's moral and social phi- losophy: that in every one of these three points Plato would have to agree with his pupil's argument in defence of slavery: (i) that slavery is good for the slave (as well as for the master): better to be ruled by an alien reason, than not to be ruled by reason at all (Section I of this paper); (2) that this difference in intellectual and social status rests on a diversity of native endowment: nature is the original factor 57 I254a 29-32, Rackham's tr. Other passages too show that Aristotle thinks of slavery not as an isolated fact but as a special instance of a general relation which connects slavery with his whole philosophic system: e.g., Eud. Eth. I24gb 6 ff., Nic. Eth. ii6ia 32 ff. The analogy of the master-slave to the soul-body relation enables us to con- nect it with the most general pattern of Aristotelian metaphysics, the relation of form to matter. Soul is the form of the body, and body the matter of the soul (de An. 4I!2a i 6). And since (v Ai nv r aiVa-yKaLOV, r6 8' o0 9VEKa &amp; ,r4 X&amp;yo? (Phys. 2ooa 14), the Aristotelian contrast of mechanism to teleology is, as in Plato, analogous to the contrast of slave to master.</page><page sequence="15">No. 3.] SLAVERY IN PLATO'S THOUGHT 303 in differentiating the philosopher from the producer and a fortiori from the slave ;58 (3) that this difference only repeats on the human plane a pattern writ large over the cosmos: the master's benevolent reason persuading the slave's irrational force fulfils a function analogous to that of the Demiurge, persuading towards the Good the irrational aacnke of the material universe (Section II of this paper). IV. CONCLUSION This study does not suggest that Plato deduced his political theory, his psychology, or his cosmology, from his concept of slavery. No such deduction is to be found in his writings, and it is profitless to speculate about the unpublished adventures of his mind. What it does suggest is that his views about slavery, state, man, and the world, all illustrate a single hierarchic pattern; and that the key to the pattern is in his idea of logos with all the implications of a dualist epistemology.59 The slave lacks logos; so does the multitude in the state, the body in man, and material necessity in the universe. Left to itself each of these would be disorderly and vicious in the sense of that untranslatably Greek word, hubris. Order is imposed upon them, by a benevolent superior: master, guardian, mind, demiurge. Each of these rules (archein) in his own domain. The common title to authority is the possession of logos. In such an intel- lectual scheme slavery is "natural": in perfect harmony with one's notions about the nature of the world and of man. There is another world-view that is the antithesis of Platonic idealism, and would be persecuted in the Platonic utopia as false, wicked, impious, subversive.8 It is associated with Ionian physics61 and the contract theory of the state. It is scientific in 58 See the use of 4dfoLS, ifco, etc. in Rep. 370ab, 374e-376c, 428e 9, 43IC 7, 590C 3; PoWt. 30Ie, 3o9ab, 3ioa; Laws 875c. 59 I refer to the separation (XCpLOtp6s) of the Forms from the particulars. At- tempts to explain this away have been made by Natorp, C. Ritter, and many others. They are not convincing. See F. M.
