Considerable work has examined the place of pets in humans’ lives,  although most of this research takes for granted that pets are certain animals.  While these perspectives provide insight into the character of human-nonhuman  relationships, the assumptions underlying such research frequently invest in a  concept of pets as having essential qualities. This paper explores the possibility  that petness, which can generally be defined as the state, quality, or conditions  under which a pet is constituted, arises from social relations and the treatment of  objects. Using the example of virtual pets I will argue that there is no essential  “petness” to anything and that it is a social construct. More specifically, I contend  that pets are the product of the investment of human emotion into objects. After  outlining how such treatment is not exclusive to the animals that live close to us,  but is similarly exhibited toward inanimate entities as well as other sentient crea- tures, I conclude with some discussion of how pet relations can be understood in  the context of late capitalism.

Mots clés: pet; animaux de compagnie; animal virtuel; rapport; attachement;  tamagochi; constructivisme social Being cannot be anything but being-with-one-another  — Jean-Luc Nancy introduCtion Over twenty-five years ago, Clifton Bryant accused sociologists of failing to address the “zoological component” in human interaction  and social systems. Sociologists, he claimed,  have often been myopic in their observations of human behaviour, cultural  patterns and social relationships, and unfortunately have not taken into  account the permeating social influence of animals in our larger cultural  fabric, and our more idiosyncratic individual modes of interaction and  relationships in their analyses of social life. (1979:400)  Since then, many sociologists have studied the prominence of animal- human relations, and arguably one of the best researched areas concerns  the subject of pets and pet keeping. A burgeoning literature has explored  the origins, utility, benefits, costs, and even difficulties associated with  the human practice of living with pet or companion animals; these rela- tionships are among the most common and significant in contemporary  Western societies. At least half of all households in the English speaking  world have pets and nearly 90% of pet owners consider pets to be family  members (Plous 1993:2; Siegal 1993:157-8, Kruuk 2002:137-8).  While pets have been the subject of a great deal of attention, few  authors have theorized the relation that constitutes animals as pets or  questioned the quality of what I will call “petness.” Most researchers  recognize that there is nothing inherent to being a pet and agree that  animals are labeled and handled differently according to the arbitrariness  of humans’ practices (Eddy 2003a). What connects most work on pets,  including the ethical, theoretical, and empirical research, is that “the pet”  is assumed to be an animal. Yet pets may not be living creatures and  nonliving pets are either unnoticed or dismissed as inferior and trivial.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1035 This is not to say there is no research on other types of pets, namely,  virtual or inanimate pets that are not live animals (see Bickmore 1998;  Bloch and Lemish 1999; Kritt 2000). Rather, what does exist has been  largely marginalized to studies in new technologies, computers, or popu- lar culture. Missing is a sociological examination of petness in its vari- ous manifestations. The literature on the question, “what is a pet,” is  problematic because it speaks to petness by looking at animals called  pets rather than examining the larger social relation of petness and ap- plying this framework to objects and animals.  This paper represents my attempt to rectify this situation by mak- ing a few simple arguments. I take the position that there is no essential  “petness” to anything and that it is a social construction. I will argue that  petness, which can generally be defined as the state, quality, or condi- tions under which a pet is constituted, arises from social relations and the  treatment of objects. I contend that pets are a product of the investment  of human emotion into objects, and that this is not exclusive to animals,  but is also exhibited in our treatment of inanimate and inorganic entities.  of oBJeCtS and animalS: Preliminary ConCePtual iSSueS  It is important to identify the limitations and boundaries of this work. My  use of the term “object” to refer to all pets, including animals, may seem  inappropriate since animals are sentient beings and virtual pets are in- organic machines. Sentience generally refers to the capacity to feel, par- ticularly pleasure or pain. It is implied that this capacity operates through  some sort of consciousness, is expressed in behaviour, and therefore, is  measurable. Thus, sentience links with the ability to be responsive, at- tentive, alert, and so on.2 As I explain further below, even though there  are obvious differences in their constitution, virtual pets show these ca- pabilities. Of course it would be unwise to believe these emanate from  any true selves in virtual pets. But having or lacking a self is not a pre- requisite for being a social creature. For example, Hacking (1999) and  Latour (1988b) have convincingly argued that society comprises both  human and nonhuman “kinds” or “actants,” who create material and so- cial realities. Likewise, they note many situations in which these entities,  aware or not, create interesting and novel forms of sociality. As pets,  things become the objects of human intervention and interpretation. I  take the position that a pet is an object because it is constituted in relation  2. Sentience is a more complex physiological, biological, and philosophical concept than  I have intimated. In part, this is because sentience in other creatures (as well as some  humans), is contested. For a richer discussion of sentience and its relationship with  ethical decision-making, see Singer (1975).  </page> <page sequence="4"> 1036 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 to a subject, which is independent of animal selfhood. Both animals and  automated machines become pets by virtue of humans granting them,  through various actions, such status. I recognize that animals are beings  and not inanimate, like tables. But this quality, as important as it is, has  no bearing on their designation as pets.   This essay is not an examination of the nature or characteristics of  petness and I will not attempt to identify the criteria for classifying this  relation. My aim here is more modest but, I believe, an important start- ing point for those who might take on those projects. Sociologists need  to start talking relationally about the social form of petness. By explor- ing the case of interactive virtual pets, I will show that the tendency to  define and unwittingly delimit the category of pet is problematic because  social scientists are ignoring relationships that are important to people.  We need to question the quality of these categories and interrogate the  ways in which they are constructed. A useful starting point lies in an explanation of why this is a valu- able undertaking. Why is it important to differentiate between pets and  pet relations? To frame this inquiry, Werner Herzog’s 2005 documentary  film, Grizzly Man, is instructive in a number of ways. Grizzly Man is the  story of amateur grizzly bear specialist and activist, Timothy Treadwell  who, with Amie Hugeunard, was mauled and killed in an October 2003  bear attack. For thirteen years, Treadwell journeyed to Alaska’s Katmai  National Park Preserve to study and live among grizzly bears. During his  last four trips, he shot over 100 hours of video detailing bear life, and in  telling this story, Herzog relies considerably on Treadwell’s own footage.  But the recordings are more than just distant shots of bears eating, fight- ing and so on. Treadwell tapes himself as an active participant-observer.  He is frequently shown near the bears, engaging with them verbally and  even physically. It is this feature which is particularly fascinating be- cause Treadwell moves beyond making observations about bears to talk  about himself and his place among them. It becomes obvious that he  believes the animals to be his companions. For instance, he names most  of the bears and describes them as individuals who behave distinctively.  He sings and reads to them, and frequently uses “baby talk” in his com- munications. He regularly expresses his affection for them, proclaiming:  “I love you, I love you” and “You’re so beautiful, aren’t you?” He refers  to the bears and also some foxes as friends, particularly a “favorite” bear  named Mr. Chocolate, who “has been with [him] for over a decade [and  is] a good friend” (emphasis mine).   The character and depth of Treadwell’s feelings is not lost on the  many people, including his friends and family, as well as bear and wild- life experts, who provide perspective on his conduct. Their opinions are  </page> <page sequence="5"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1037 exceptionally polarized as each reflects on Treadwell’s relationship with  these wilderness animals. While some defend his deep adoration of, and  devotion toward, the grizzlies, others are more critical of his actions and  intentions. His behaviour has been described as a type of disrespectful  interference that puts both bears and humans at risk. He was also ac- cused by many of having an “unhealthy” relationship with the animals,  misguidedly portraying them as cuddly companions rather than as “the  ferocious wild animals they are.” One critic even alleged that “he had  lost sight of what was really going on; got what he was asking for, what  he deserved.”  One of the most salient features of the film was the nearly unani- mous disapproval of Treadwell’s connection to the bears. Many people  remarked that Treadwell treated them “like pets” and either implied or  explicitly stated that this was wrong. But why can’t bears, or any other  entity for that matter, be a pet? Certainly bears, as well many reptiles,  land and aquatic mammals, sea creatures, insects, fish, and birds, are  not commonly kept or known as pets. Should this disqualify them from  being such?  There are two related problems with the claim that certain animals  or objects cannot be pets. First, to do so would be entirely essentialist.  Investing in objects necessitates identifying those characteristics which  any entity must have to belong to a particular group. If we exclude cer- tain objects from the category, then we concede the basis for our classifi- cation lies in the properties of things instead of the way we are connected  to them (Emirbayer 1997). Using the example of virtual pets, I hope to  show that this approach cannot be sustained; we must take a construc- tionist approach to understanding pet relations. Second, the view that  there is something inherent about being a pet creates a boundary, with the  attendant difficulties of defending it. This necessitates excluding some  things even if they are thought of and treated as if they are pets. Know- ledge of pets becomes partial with gaps, omissions, and exclusions; how  we describe or account for certain characteristics of modern social life  is limited. This is exactly what has happened with petness — it has been  instantiated.   Sociologists and other scholars, particularly those who work in the  field of animal-human relations, should be extremely wary of such a  prospect. Investing in a pet/nonpet dualism suspiciously resembles as- sertions of human exceptionalism that situate humans in opposition to  animals. The animal/human divide remains a key feature of modern life.  As Bingham (2006:490) puts it:  we need to deal with a philosophical inheritance according to which other  </page> <page sequence="6"> 1038 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 things than the human are always defined by their lack in comparison  with ‘us.’ Lack of language, lack of consciousness, lack of reason, lack  of authenticity; the hegemonic (if never homogeneous) treatment of the  nonhuman has always been ... about shoring up the human.... With good reason, ideas that suppress the similarities and stress the  differences between animals and humans have come under scrutiny such  that the conceptual divide is (becoming) far more flexible (cf. Arluke and  Sanders 1996; Irvine 2007; Noske 1997a; Serpell 1986; Singer 1975).  Attempts to highlight the commonalities between humans and animals  are still met with suspicion. There is no reason to think the border be- tween pets and nonpets is less inflexible or even less important. If Griz- zly Man illustrates anything, it is that there is a powerful yet invisible  boundary that arbitrarily separates pets from nonpet “others,” whatever  their form.   Current PerSPeCtiveS on Pet animal aSSoCiationS  In order to appreciate petness as a relation, it important to examine the  scholarship on pet animals that already exists. While most of the litera- ture assumes that pets are animals, it can still provide insight as to how  petness is constituted. The literature on pets focuses largely on two asso- ciated issues: defining a pet, and outlining why people keep pets. While  the first subject bears significantly on the topic of this paper, generally  those who address it explicitly tend to talk about pet animals in and of  themselves and not about petness relationally. In order to distance myself  from this, I will first examine the research that speaks to the topic of why  people keep pets. This will frame my discussion of why the qualities  generally used to distinguish pet animals from nonpet animals should not  be seen as essential to their constitution. We must, instead, view them as  composed through human emotion and relationships.  One of the key questions that has characterized theorizing and empir- ical research on pet animals centres on the subject of why they are kept.  This provides insights into what pets are, but it is predominantly useful  because its starting place is the relationship they have with humans. Gen- erally those who speak to the question of why humans have pets imply  the reasons are positive (Shell 1986). This appears to be a sensible pre- sumption. Why would so many people live with and take care of animals  if doing so was not worthwhile or rewarding? But we must not conflate  keeping with loving, or assume that the emotional investment in pets is  one of straightforward adoration. Plenty of research has pointed out this  is often not the case. For instance, Kogan et al. (2004) recognize that ani- </page> <page sequence="7"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1039 mals act as the conduit through which intimate violence against women  is perpetrated. They explain that abusive partners regularly threaten or  harm pets in order to control, hurt, or intimidate women and that con- cern for pets’ safety often delays leaving abusive situations. Likewise,  Flynn (2001) identifies a number of zoological crimes and cruel deeds  that are regularly committed against animals, including those with whom  humans share their lives.3  Certainly many pets are actively and immensely loved. Yet they may  not be loved at all. They may be treated like possessions, as they are in  Canadian law. They may be taunted, teased, ignored, neglected, or cruel- ly abused. Pets seem to exist in a strange state where they can be loved  ones, family members, friends, throwaways, companions, sources of  support, objects of frustration, pests, nuisances, or victims (Shell 1986).  In short, they are objects of ambivalent emotions and treatment, which  makes identifying one foundational quality of petness difficult.   Although the exploitative treatment mentioned above might seem at  odds with caring and nurturing behaviour typically associated with pets,  Tuan (1984) explains how such varied emotional and physical conduct  can coexist in our interaction with pets. Tuan claims humans derive great  pleasure in exercising power, particularly over nature. While he recog- nizes this is often manifested in overt acts of exploitation or brutality,  he also believes we can satisfy the desire to dominate or master others  through more benign actions, most notably, affectionate, paternalistic  ones. Accordingly, Tuan argues our adoration for pets is one way humans  exert control. This makes endearment inseparable from dominance. He  writes:  Affection mitigates domination, making it softer and more acceptable,  but affection itself is possible only in relationships of inequality. It is the  warm and superior feeling one has toward things that one can care for and  patronize. (1984:5)   To be sure, the relationship between humans and animals, especially  those with which we reside, is necessarily imbalanced. We are animals’  stewards; we control what they eat, where they go, where and when they  3. Flynn’s argument applies to all animals, not just those characterized as pets. Most im- portantly, he attempts to challenge predominant notions of what cruelty means when  applied more broadly. Flynn argues that while humans consistently mistreat animals,  only under certain circumstances (for instance, when visited upon pets) are such acts  deemed malicious and wrong. This is because callous behaviour only represents ac- tions that are outside of socially acceptable boundaries, which can therefore only hap- pen to particular animals. Such practices as killing animals for meat, hunting them,  using them for scientific research, and a host of other “border cases” (which depend on  the time and context) do not count as cruelty because they are customary and accepted.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 1040 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 urinate and defecate, whether they reproduce, and so on. We even train  them to behave and induce them to play or perform tricks for our amuse- ment. Affection toward pets then, should not be considered in opposition  to dominance. Rather, it simply should be regarded as its softer side.   For Tuan, equal interspecies love appears impossible because pet- ness is underscored by the human ability to manage others, both physic- ally and representationally. Surely this aspect of petness should not be  ignored. We must accept that dominance is always a possibility in pet- ness, whether its expression is tied to caring or violence. However, it is  also too narrow to be the fundamental feature. For instance, Tuan charac- terizes pets as “diminished beings” or “personal belongings ... that one  can take delight in, play with, or set aside, as one wishes” (1984:141).  This portrayal seems to overlook the significant place pet animals have  in humans’ lives. Although it is true that many pets are treated cruelly, a  large number are not. Many pets are more than small playthings we en- gage with recreationally, but are close companions with whom we share  our time, energy, love, and lives (Irvine 2004b). It would be careless  to reduce these feelings merely to a latent desire to dominate, especial- ly since what might be termed “equal” relationships between humans  also display such tensions and exceptions. Smith (2003) insists that the  dominance/affection model is an inadequate framework for discussing  pet-human relationships because it is always there, always possible, and  unavoidably ignores the ways in which humans attempt to cope with  their power and to relate to animals in a more egalitarian manner. Above  all, she criticizes this model as missing critical points regarding the daily  interactions between animals and their human companions, which in- volve reciprocal interaction and negotiation. Dominance/affection char- acterizes pets as entirely submissive, obedient, and without any agency  even though many both people’s and animals’ day-to-day experiences  suggest otherwise. Ultimately whether dominance is seen as endemic to, or in conflict  with affection, most theorists accept that humans are drawn to pets.  Some authors claim that biological factors account for our connection  with animals. I doubt such explanations fully account for the vast array  of reasons people have pets and I recognize that claims rooted in biology  or genetics have the dubious characteristic of fostering essentialism. But  they do impress upon us that biological capacities influence our (puta- tively exclusive) social relations. For that reason, it is worth recognizing  there are a few types of animals, particularly cats and dogs, which may  be popular, in part, because of their characteristics. In examining the rise  of pet keeping, Serpell (1986) wonders what made small carnivores ap- pealing companions, and offers several reasons for their attractiveness.  </page> <page sequence="9"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1041 To begin with, he appreciates that the domestication of dogs and cats is  an accident of history driven by the coalescence of harmonious forces,  which include elements of their species-specific dispositions. They’re  not too large or too small, do not need to be caged continuously, are  not overly or indiscriminately violent, and “like” to be around humans  because they are either highly social (dogs) or because they are tied to  certain territories (cats). He further notes that they were likely useful  for keeping away pests or doing other important work, which helped to  foster more affective relationships. Kruuk believes that cats and dogs  are more suitable as companions than other animals for several critical  reasons (2002:144). They impose few limitations on humans’ lives since  they are only active for a few hours each day. They are also highly intel- ligent, adaptable, and readily trained. These animals can fit in to humans’  lives and dwellings, whatever shape they take, quite easily.  While such speculation may provide some insights into how ani- mals emerged as widespread household companions, it does little to ac- tually explain contemporary relationships between animals and humans  whereby pets are bred, sought out, live luxuriously, and are of little or no  instrumental utility (Nast 2006). Other authors recognize that pets today  are generally “useless” economically and instead contend that their ap- peal lies in more sentimental and visceral factors. Wilson (1984) certain- ly adopts this perspective. He argues that biological processes compel  humans toward a love of nature, calling this phenomenon, biophilia. He  claims that there is an instinctive bond between humans and other liv- ing entities, particularly animals. This can help account for why humans  keep pets, and also engage in a whole host of other behaviours, including  such mundane practices as tending gardens, taking hikes, going to zoos,  etc. In his view, our love for life forms and our desire to be around them  is natural and may even serve evolutionary purposes. Serpell (1986) ac- knowledges this as a distinct possibility in accounts of pet ownership.  He argues that pet keeping is habitually deemed a silly aberration be- cause it seems to serve no recognizable purpose. However, he wonders  whether humans are generally predisposed to love other creatures and if  cruel and exploitative treatment is the deviation that has slowly become  accepted through processes of rationalization. Again, claims about hu- mans’ or animals’ biological dispositions must be met with caution and  understood only in the context of a given society. For instance, Wilson’s  recognition of humans’ love for the natural world may not be instinc- tual, but rather a simple reaction to seemingly endless urbanization or a  feature of humans’ increasing concern for an environment under threat.  Romantic understandings of human pet relationships are not the only  ones influenced by evolutionary theory. Archer (1997) maintains that the  </page> <page sequence="10"> 1042 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 combination of humans’ and animals’ innate qualities is responsible for  pet ownership. In his opinion, pet-human relationships are difficult to  understand because attachment and devoting resources to another species  are fitness-reducing activities, at least in theory. Nevertheless, humans  are highly attached. He argues this is because pets manipulate responses  that have evolved to facilitate human relationships, particularly between  children and parents. He claims: “the initial appeal of the pet arouses  the owner’s interest and sets off the subsequent train of interactions”  (1997:251). This appeal is found in pet animals’ neonatal physical char- acteristics: their proportionally large heads, big circular eyes, soft fur,  seeming astonishment at small wonders, spontaneous and inquisitive  character, and so on (Hart 2003). Archer describes pets’ relationships  with humans as parasitic since they exploit innate human tendencies to  care for and nurture young humans. He accepts that pets serve an emo- tional purpose and provide love and companionship to people (whether  real or perceived), but he doubts whether this role compensates for the  resources they use.   The company and affection provided by pet animals are doubtless  the most recognized of their qualities. Many researchers have wondered  whether there is a link between these qualities and pets’ ability to im- prove health, well being, and the quality of humans’ lives. While the  data on the health effects of pet ownership do not paint a consistent pic- ture, Siegal (1993) claims that most studies demonstrate some mental  or physical health advantage to the practice. In her own work, Siegal is  most interested in the link between attachment and stress reduction. She  argues that people learn to become attached to pet animals because they  consistently provide positive responses. Their association with feeling  good, wanted, and so on, “leads the owner to view the animal as a source  of comfort” (1993:163). Accordingly, pets provide security and reassur- ance, which decrease people’s anxiety, reduce stress, and therefore, may  improve health. Others have focused on the immediate physical bene- fits of owning pets. For instance, Friedmann et al. (1980) found that pet  ownership increased one’s chances of surviving a heart attack by over  20%. Most notably, other factors, such as whether patients were married,  did not produce significant results. Pets enhanced the recovery of their  owners irrespective of the severity of the original heart attack. Katcher  et al. (1983) linked watching fish in aquariums with a reduction in blood  pressure, most markedly among people suffering from hypertension.  McNicholas et al. (2005:1252) observe that pet ownership has been as- sociated with lower use of medical services and a reduced risk of cardio- vascular disease, to name a few benefits. It is no wonder that pet-assisted  therapy and companion animal visitation programs are ballooning across  </page> <page sequence="11"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1043 North America. It appears that the links between pet companionship and  human health or happiness underscore the reality that pets make most  people happy.  In spite of these conclusions, most researchers remark that pets are  not principally valued for their role in health improvement. Rather, they  are appreciated for the companionship they offer for its own sake. In the  main, pet animals are viewed as humans’ friends, which is evident in  their treatment throughout life and upon death. Many pets are indulged  with a variety of specialty foods, toys, medicine, clothing, and other ac- cessories intended to improve their quality of life. People who lose their  pets often experience immense sadness, grief, or even depression. De- ceased pets are given funerals (even beside the toilet bowl for pet fish) or  graves with markers bearing special messages (Shell 1986:122). These  feelings represent a key component of petness. Still, such responses to  pet death do not quite capture what pets “are.” For instance, people seem  to love and even mourn the passing of animals in zoos, marine parks,  or in the wild. Should these animals count as pets? Outlining the way  pets have been defined by others shows there is no basis for insisting  these, and any other creatures, should be not count as pets. Inevitably,  the problem with trying to characterize or classify pets, per se, is that we  miss the critical point that they can’t be classified. We can only outline  the practices that constitute entities and relationships.  Although many scholars conduct research on human-pet relation- ships without really addressing what pets are, others have attempted to  tackle this tricky matter and define pets. However, most of the presumed  characteristics that supposedly differentiate pets from nonpets do not  hold up under scrutiny. Pets have no essential characteristics and they are  solely created by humans’ view and conduct toward them. This is likely  the reason there is no agreed upon definition of what makes an animal a  pet — there are simply too many traits that both pets and nonpets pos- sess. Some of the commonly noted qualities and attendant definitions are  worth mentioning, if only to emphasize the point that we must look at  relations, and not objects’ essences.  Likely one of the most popular properties that purportedly distin- guishes pets from other animals is their status as nonfood entities. This is  not to say that any one animal is universally recognized as a pet protect- ed from consumption. The pets of one region may be the dietary staples  of another. Instead, pets are seen to be animals that are never eaten. Ser- pell (1986:53–55) summarizes some of the key reasons pets are nonfood  entities, and suggests that the taboo is linked to proximity. For instance,  he notes that some authors claim consuming a pet is symbolically asso- ciated with the sexual intercourse between close relatives. Others argue  </page> <page sequence="12"> 1044 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 that pet animals are seen to resemble humans too closely. Belk (1996) re- marks that competing metaphors whereby animals vacillate between the  human civilized world and the chaotic animalistic one make pets indeter- minates. Thus, eating them would be too close to a form of cannibalism.  While the idea of eating a beloved pet cat may be sickening, according to  Lawrence (2003) this boundary far from rigid. For instance, she points to  school programs where children raise farm animals, and in effect deem  them pets. Yet these animals eventually will be sold for slaughter and  eaten. It is also quite common for people to nurture their future dinners.  Noske (1997b) points out that the practice of protecting or coddling and  caring for animals intended as food is ordinary among some pastoralists  in Africa, while Wright (2004) documents similar behaviour in farmers  in the American Midwest. Animals’ statuses and destinies have also been  known to change quite rapidly depending on the circumstances.4  Even if we cannot completely distinguish pets from nonfood ani- mals, others have provided some insight into how pets can be identi- fied. Eddy (2003a:100) explores some dictionary definitions to provide  perspective. He notes that the word pet means either: “a domesticated  animal kept for pleasure rather than utility”; or “a) a pampered and usu- ally spoiled child or b) a person who is treated with unusual kindness  or consideration.” In his view, the former definition is problematic for  several reasons. For one thing, many pet animals work and provide in- come. They may be bred and their offspring sold, raced, used in hunting,  on farms, in therapeutic settings, and so on. Moreover, the idea of be- ing domesticated is quite vague. Generally it refers to the phenomenon  whereby life forms are adapted to live under human influence. Rollin  and Rollin (2003:107) say that domestication is no longer accepted as  a specification of petness since it is an ambiguous term that generates  unnecessary and distracting questions. However, they do suggest that  pets are at least domestic, which is a geographic reference meant to cap- ture animals’ living conditions. Pets are seen as residing with or in close  proximity to humans and in this respect differ from wild, captive, food  and working animals. Ultimately, Eddy (2003a:103) rejects this outlook,  instead defining pets as “animals who are treated with unusual kindness  or consideration.” In his opinion, this definition is advantageous since:  ...it stresses the amicable view held by the person for the animals, it re- mains silent on the function to which the animal was (or will be) put, and  the source of the animal has no bearing on its status as a pet.... In a sense,  4. To some degree these examples do not really speak to the idea of eating pets. It might  be entirely different to take on an animal as a companion and subsequently eat it than  to care for an animal that, at birth, is known to be food. Nevertheless, the cases at least  illustrate that the boundary is far from rigid.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1045 the adoption of this definition results in a greater focus on the humans  involved in the human-pet relations, and places less of an emphasis on any  intrinsic or extrinsic properties of the animals themselves (2003a:103).  Eddy recognizes that animals in zoos, aquariums, or other locations  can be pets and that it is the relationship that should be central. His ideas  speak to my position that it is relations that make petness.  Unfortunately Eddy fails to provide a completely relational perspec- tive, and therefore, his analysis suffers from some problems. Notably,  his definition remains invested in objects and not relations (Eddy 2003a;  2003b). He overtly defines pets as animals and the qualification of “un- usual kindness” is ambiguous. Treating something with unusual kind- ness suggests that the treatment is remarkable. Even if there is an im- plicit contrast between pet and nonpet animals, how could roughly 50  million typical pets, as well as the other entities he wants included in the  category, all be treated remarkably? Rather than being remarkable, such  treatment is actually quite ordinary. More importantly, some animals that  are clearly pets get excluded — those that are abused or treated cruelly  (Rollin and Rollin 2003:107). Petness often includes positive emotional  interaction and affection, yet as mentioned, it is underscored by the pos- sibility of domination, which may be expressed in acts that are clearly  malicious, exploitative, and punishing (Tuan 1984). Eddy was further  criticized by Rollin and Rollin for neglecting to offer a precise definition  of pets that “encompasses all things that we ordinarily call pets, and only  those things that we ordinarily call pets” (2003:110). In breaking from  their view, I think that particular contribution represents both the beauty  and obstacle in investigating petness: it offers possibilities but may defy  convention. Sanders (2003:115) puts it this way:  it is more productive to acquire an understanding of the reality of the phe- nomenon as it is defined by the social actors in whom we are interested.... Approaching the issue of what is a pet, how this designation is understood,  and how people use an animal’s ‘pethood’ to shape interaction moves us  outside of the constraints of viewing the pet as an ‘object’ in the world of  obdurate reality into a more rich, flexible and often ambivalent realm of  subjective definitions that people use to shape, understand and experience  their relationships with their nonhuman coactors.  Sanders’ stance allows us to investigate what qualities make entities  worthy of humans’ attention and devotion as pets without requiring that  any of them be present. Overall, the point should not be that any particu- lar creature cannot be included, but rather, that any one can.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 1046 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 PetneSS in the inanimate While petness in nonliving things has been overlooked by most academ- ics, in the last decade there has been a proliferation of virtual pets. What  were once simple computerized devices that responded in predictable  and highly structured ways are now sophisticated entities that vary con- siderably in their make up and capabilities. These virtual, cyber, robotic,  and artificial pets comprise a multibillion dollar industry that spans both  the material and the online world, and covers everything from virtual  keychain, robotic, and plush pets, to online, wireless/cell phone, and CD- rom pets. The flourishing industry, and the millions of people worldwide  who engage with these technologies, have not gone unnoticed. Aside  from business analysts, a handful of people working in the fields of tech- nology and mental health have attempted to understand the place and  utility of these pets. Some of this work is striking because it recognizes  that virtual pets serve an emotional purpose. In fact, the parallels be- tween animal pets and object pets have been drawn overtly. However,  this point needs further exploration. The problem is that pet objects are  seen as akin to pet animals, but not as true pets in their own right.   As mentioned, there are a range of different inanimate pet objects  available on today’s market, but it is likely that many readers do not  know what they are or what they do. To some degree, this is because  many of these products are most popular among children and teen- agers. The most fashionable of the virtual pets are the material ones:  Tamagotchis, Furbies, Aibos (or similar competitors, NeCoRo, Tama,  and PARO). Bandai’s keychain pet, the Tamagotchi, was the first of the  virtual pets introduced in recent years. Tamagotchis were originally con- ceived by a Japanese mother for her children who could not own an ani- mal because of limited living space (Bloch and Lemish 1999:284). This  virtual pet is a tiny creature from another planet that lives in a hand-held  liquid screen enclosed in a plastic egg-shaped covering with a number  of tiny push-buttons on it. Once the game is turned on, the pet is hatched  (born), the name, birthdate, “sex” and time are recorded, and owners take  on the responsibility of raising “it.” In order to sustain the pets, owners  must engage with them regularly. Tamagotchis require ongoing and bal- anced care, which is indicated by an alarm and icon that appears on the  screen. To ensure they become happy and healthy, owners must provide  such necessities as food, drink, clothing, medication, exercise, play, toi- let flushing, teaching, and praising, which can each be dispensed at the  touch of a button. Owners should even turn out Tamagotchis’ lights when  they go to sleep. However, sometimes Tamagotchis will refuse owners’  intrusions, at which time they require scolding. At any point an owner  </page> <page sequence="15"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1047 can also assess the Tamagotchi’s progress and identify its needs, looking  at the age, weight (they can become overweight!), amount of training,  and level of happiness and hunger. Tamagotchis that are ignored can get  sick or die quickly, and then a new one will hatch, although this was not  always the case. Otherwise the lifespan is generally a few weeks. In the  third version, released in 2005, more than one pet can live within one  egg at the same time, Tamagotchis will marry and bear offspring, and  Tamagotchis can communicate and share with each other. To keep pets  happy, owners also need to visit “Tamatown” online to visit relatives,  play games, and purchase luxurious “Gotchi-Items,” including clothes,  leisure items, specialty food, travel, and other accessories. Tamagotchis  require involvement, and taking care of them requires commercial ex- penditure, forethought, and dedication.  Mival et al. (2004) argue that Tamagotchis spawned the virtual pet  craze and led to the creation of other virtual pets, including Furbies and  more “realistic” Aibos. Hasbro’s Furby differs from the Tamagotchi in  that it is a plush automated bird-like creature whose actions and reac- tions are initiated through a series of sensors that respond to light, touch,  sound, and movement in the surrounding environment. Furbies are said  to possess a number of sentiments that can be communicated through  verbal expressions of clicking, chirping, singing, and some limited  speech. More significantly, Furbies are able to move their eyes, beaks,  ears, and bodies to communicate nonverbally. These “emoto-tonics”  give the Furby a number of recognizable emotional expressions includ- ing, happiness, sleepiness, surprise, fear, sadness, and so on. Furbies can  also communicate and interact with each other, and in so doing, appear  to play cheerfully. Another notable characteristic of the Furby is that it  cannot be shut off without removing its batteries. Attempts at putting it  away are met with resistance and claims such as “me scared” or crying.  Eventually, the Furby will go to sleep, but it is easily reawakened with  stimulation. In this sense, furbies function as intelligent and expressive  beings.     Sony’s Aibo (Artifical Intelligence RoBOt) is also a larger toy pet,  but is hard plastic and shaped like a small living dog. The Aibo’s func- tionality is similar to a Furby’s, but it is also able to walk around and  can respond to roughly 100 spoken commands, much like a dog. It is  able to “see” through a camera on its head, and can therefore navigate  its physical surroundings and search out items. It will even walk to its  recharger. However, the most captivating aspect of the Aibo is its fas- tidiousness (Mival et al. 2004:3). It is able to learn tricks and play with  its owner, yet may refuse to do so for no real reason. It can also con- vey displeasure if annoyed or ignored, will refuse to interact or perform  </page> <page sequence="16"> 1048 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 tricks correctly, and can even change its posture to reflect its mood. Most  interestingly, the Aibo will slowly become more agreeable over time to  reflect development into adulthood.   There are also a number of virtual pet websites that allow you to  adopt and subsequently take care of creatures over the internet. These in- clude Neopets.com, Marapets.com, PowerPets.com, AdoptMe.com, and  Webkinz, the latter which spans the material and virtual worlds, to name  a few types. With the exception of the second last example, which allows  individuals to adopt virtual animals that bear the likeness of real bio- logical creatures (dogs, horses, snakes, etc.), the other sites feature more  magical simulations of assorted species, both real and imagined. Each of  these sites resembles Tamagotchi in that the purpose is to keep the pet  happy and healthy and to foster development. The process is far more  elaborate since these entities exist in their own large and complex worlds  where the possibilities for entertainment and engagement are endless. In  the case of Neopets, the most popular of the cyberpets, you can create a  new pet or adopt one that has been abandoned at the adoption centre.5 In- dividuals can pick from a number of dispositions, choose a sex, a name,  and create a description of the pet’s character. Of course, the pet has a  variety of needs. It requires food, toys, accommodation, game-playing,  medicine, pets of its own, and so on, all of which come at a cost. Owners  can earn the requisite “neopoints” to pay for such items by playing one  of hundreds of games, signing up for surveys, getting jobs, and if all  else fails, looking for the range of giveaways available throughout the  world of Neopia. Neopets also resemble Tamagotchis in the way they  make requests, demands, and express emotions, in particular, directly  conveying sentiment toward the owner. However, in contrast with the  physical virtual pets, Neopets act as the medium through which individ- uals are able to play a larger game. Individuals’ Neopets can battle each  other or preprogrammed opponents. In order to battle competitively, they  need training, equipment, and special powers, which can be costly. Indi- viduals can also complete one of the many secret explorations or various  quests available. All of this further advances the pet and the number of  possibilities within Neopia for the pet’s existence. These entities are unique and part of the way in which they are con- stituted as pets arises from their intrinsic capabilities, which differ from  more conventional toys. For example, virtual pets are much like dolls  and stuffed animals in that they are the objects of affection and nur- turance. However, Bloch and Lemish (1999) point out that while both  5. According to Alexa.com, an independent rating site that measures internet traffic,  neopets.com is among the top 150–160 most visited websites worldwide. Neopets.com  claims over 70 million virtual pet owners worldwide.  </page> <page sequence="17"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1049 stuffed toys and virtual pets can be cared for, the former engage solely  through humans’ imagination. Even somewhat physically interactive  dolls (those that need to be fed or have their diapers changed) are gener- ally unable to engage verbally. They impose materially, but are unable to  make serious spontaneous requests. By contrast, cyberpets demand what  they need while supplying the means by which to provide it (Bloch and  Lemish 1999:289). Thus, despite the profound differences between vari- ous cyberpets, Marti et al. claim they all “share key behaviors: they act  autonomously, they require frequent interaction and they develop in re- sponse to their owner’s actions” (2005:100). Virtual pets are responsive  and connect with owners in ways that are both structured and spontan- eous; they relate with and impose upon humans outside owners’ inten- tions. Dautenhahn (n.d.:5) claims that interactivity is the critical element  that makes cyberpets so believable and popular, and can even compen- sate for simple and unrealistic design. Even though most of their needs  are easily anticipated, pets’ input makes them more than simply toys  or the objects of behavioural management, as Kritt (2000:85) asserts.  What links them all is their common “useful uselessness” as companions  (Mival et al. 2004).   McCallum (n.d.) argues that their general appeal lies in their status  as both living creatures and learning devices that generate enjoyable  symbiosis. Owners care for their pets, and in return, pets remain happy,  behave obediently, return affection, and thrive. In their design, cyberpets  explicitly provoke a caring response from users, and attachment to pets  can become remarkably intense. For example, there are a large num- ber of virtual temples and graveyards dedicated to “dead” pets, mainly  Tamagotchis, and bullies have been known to intentionally “murder”  others’ unattended pets by “feeding them excessively and choking them  to death” (Zizek 1998:144). Bereaved owners write messages, poems,  songs, and obituaries expressing their love and sorrow for their adored  deceased companions. There are also virtual funerals and internet burial  sites where grieving people receive comfort from others who understand  their loss (Bloch and Lemish 1999:286). In other words, individuals  come together to mourn the passing of a loved one, despite the fact that  most Tamagotchis only live for a brief time. In some cases, people have  even committed suicide, had nervous breakdowns, or become clinically  depressed following the death of their virtual pet (Mival et al. 2004:2;  Zizek 1998:144). Surely this confirms Wu and Miller’s suspicion (2005)  that owners form genuine emotional bonds with their robotic pets.   Virtual pets are programmed to imitate both human and nonhuman  sentient beings. But the effectiveness of their configuration, and their  attendant petness, lies in the way humans experience them. Dautenhahn  </page> <page sequence="18"> 1050 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 claims believability is responsible for their popularity. Believable tech- nology is familiar to humans; it meets their needs intellectually, emotion- ally and socially. Virtual pets  look ‘alive’ because they show behaviours which are typical of animals  [and humans]: paying attention, playing, social behaviour, etc. These are  all ‘entry points’ which allow the observer to match the artifact’s actions  with behaviour which is shown by living systems. (n.d.:3) It is through interactions and the ascription of certain traits that toys,  like animals, become pets. Rational or not, owners feel emotionally at- tached to their pets and even experience these entities as animate. They  attribute intentioned aims to them. Kahn et al. (2006) found that virtual  pets’ responsiveness generated unique treatment and handling. They ob- served that while young children had similar evaluations of a stuffed dog  and an Aibo, their behaviour toward each was noticeably different. For  instance, they were far more inquisitive and reciprocal toward the Aibo,  and even showed some apprehension (flinching) when it moved. To the  researchers, this suggested that minimal social cues can generate social  responses, even when the items are known to be artificial. Indeed, this  is a critical difference between pets and toys, games or hobby items.  Whereas these latter three objects may be played, enjoyed, or fiddled  with, petness is characteristic of objects that play or act back and gener- ate meaningful social contact.  Caporael (1986:215) recognizes such reactions as anthropomorph- ism: “the ascription of human characteristics to nonhuman entities.” In  his opinion, the personification of inanimate objects is widespread and  yet largely ignored in modern life. Nevertheless, he suggests it serves  the important function of bringing these entities into the social world.  He further explains,  many people have entrenched, coaxed and threatened a recalcitrant car,  have inferred human feelings and motivations as causal explanations for  otherwise inexplicable malfunctioning, and in short, entered (briefly or  extensively) into social relations with their automobiles. Anthropomorph- ized, even unintelligent machines become social entities.   Other researchers acknowledge that anthropomorphism is overt in hu- mans’ dealings with such machines as virtual pets. Research conducted  by Marti et al. (2005) among children with severe cognitive impairments  found explicit reference to a robotic seal’s emotional state. They “recog- nized” such feelings as sadness, anger, and even happiness in the robotic  pet (2005:105). Even research among adults suggests that anthropo- morphism is an important quality. Wu and Miller’s study (2005) with  </page> <page sequence="19"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1051 elderly individuals illustrated that human-like interaction is an important  feature for assistive technologies. Those in the study reported that their  decision to respond positively was directly affected by the technology’s  capacity to be “polite” and to have a positive and natural personality.  What is important in each of these studies is that machines become indi- viduals with which people engage on a more intimate level. Each of the  aforementioned authors largely reifies the belief that action and emotion  are the territory of the human. Their assertions nevertheless imply that  anthropomorphism is more than a psychological mechanism since the  focus is on social action and reaction.  Latour (1988a) is also critical of the view, largely endorsed by soci- ologists, that anthropomorphism is a misguided mental “projection” of  human behaviour or feeling onto nonhuman objects. He argues that there  are no singularly human qualities; inanimate objects always possess the  qualities and do the work credited to humans. In this way, living and  nonliving things are already mutually (re)active since “‘anthropos’ and  ‘morphos’ together mean either what has human shape or what gives  shape to humans” (1988a:303). This latter meaning has largely been  eclipsed by the former, but it is critical in understanding the essentially  social, not psychological, nature of anthropomorphism. In the case of vir- tual pets, we must recognize that they are more than machines to which  we ascribe human or animal characteristics through mental processes. In  their being, virtual pets operate and are experienced as life-like entities.  We respond to them, and they to us. As Dautenhahn (n.d.:5) puts it:  what makes cyberpets special is the fact that they exhibit interesting be- haviours only in the interaction space of agent and user. Social bonding  cannot be generated by the agent, or user alone. But by agent and user  interacting with each other, new forms of interesting behaviours on a dif- ferent level of complexity can emerge.  Virtual pets and their owners are co-constituted in social reciprocation.  Anthropomorphism and its simultaneous partner, “morphoanthropism”,6  imply mutuality — not necessarily in intention (although Latour’s ex- ample of the inanimate door closer “on strike” diminishes this qualifi- cation) — but certainly in action and outcome (1988a:303). Anthropo- morphism is inherently social because inanimates manipulate, and are  manipulated by, humans. For Dautenhahn,  cyberpets are examples of how humans view and interact with the (social)  6. Morphoanthropism is my term. I use it to highlight the different and noteworthy defini- tion generated by placing “morphos” in front of “anthros” to mean what gives shape to  humans.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 1052 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 world, how they are biased to interpret the world in terms of intentionality,  and how much humans need the feeling of belonging and being engaged  with the world. (n.d.:6–7; italics mine, parentheses in original) This serves to demonstrate that inanimate objects need to be taken  more seriously as participants in the social world. Certainly they are not  inherently so. More importantly, they are also not pets by reason of some  shorthanded parallel. Inanimate and virtual pets are not virtually pets or  “like” pets; they are, simply, pets.  PetneSS and the SoCiologiCal imagination I have illustrated why petness is an important concept that highlights the  relations that generate pet objects. My discussion has largely focused  on the importance of pets or petness to individuals, thereby emphasiz- ing the more psychological processes and effects of engaging with ani- mal and digital others. But sociological concerns are eminently different  from psychological ones in that the sociologist, broadly speaking, stud- ies the social dynamics of modern society. For my purposes, it is worth  considering the way in which petness relates to other social forces. For  instance, why are the number and diversity of pets increasing? How can  we understand petness with regard to larger social processes? What sorts  of forces underlie this growing trend? These are important questions if  the idea of virtual pets is a coherent one, as I believe it is.  Anthony Giddens (1991) offers some insight in this respect. He  argues the focus of existence is increasingly upon processes of self- actualization, and that people’s choices become a means of expressing  self-identity. Yet this is always changing and is “something that has to  be routinely created and sustained in the reflexive activities of the indi- vidual” (1991:52). However, Giddens claims such reflexivity is a key  feature of both sexual and platonic interpersonal relationships. This is  because they have transformed into what he terms “pure relationships.”  The pure relationship (1991:87–97) centres on trust, commitment, and  intimacy, instead of obligations stemming from external economic or  social-cultural forces. It is sought simply for the satisfaction closeness  with another can offer, “unprompted by other than the rewards that the  relationship provides” (1991:90). More than this, he claims the pure re- lationship is “prototypical of the new spheres of personal life” insofar as  it also requires continuous reflection and work (1991:6).  Giddens’ notion of the pure relationship suggests mutual activity on  the part of self-conscious subjects since intimacy requires individuals  constantly assess their status in relation to others. Accordingly, the self  </page> <page sequence="21"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1053 can be amplified and secured by the relationship, but also exposed to  existential anxiety. This is because intimacy is predicated on trust, which  is linked to “achieving a sense of ontological security.” He continues:  trust in this sense is basic to a ‘protective cocoon’ which stands guard over  the self in its dealings with everyday reality. It ‘brackets out’ potential  occurrences which, were the individual seriously to contemplate them,  would produce a paralysis of the will, or feelings of engulfment. (1991:3)  While relationships with other people may offer support and pleas- ure, they may also cause apprehension or distress. Perhaps pet relations  are important because they offer the former without the latter insofar  as individuals feel unconditionally cared for by their pets. For instance,  Serpell doubts that animals can be true friends in the way other people  can. Nonetheless, he agrees that their company “enhances self-esteem  and a sense of personal worth” (1989:127). Pets allow us to invest emo- tionally in another while often (but not always) giving us the impression  that our sentiment is reciprocated. In other words, pet relations share the  contours of purity in the sense that the relationship is sought for its own  sake and is rewarding because the pets for whom we care, regardless of  their form, seemingly appreciate our attention and even care back.  While pet relations may be characterized as pure in the sense meant  by Giddens, others focus on the commodification of intimacy as it is  manifested in virtual pets. Bloch and Lemish (1999) argue the rapid  popularization and subsequent passing of the Tamagotchi fad is indica- tive of a problem underlying the character of interpersonal relationships  in consumer culture. Employing a neo-Weberian analysis to the case of  Tamagotchis, they suggest attachments increasingly lack nurturance, pa- tience, mutuality, and empathy. They argue the Tamagotchi itself, and  the consequent bond made with it, embodies the four main dimensions  of modern rationalization. This is because Tamagotchis, unlike other  people or animate pets, require minimal care and offer nothing that is  unstructured or unscripted. They explain:  Tamagotchi is efficient, providing an effective method of meeting a var- iety of needs, in its capacity for satisfying the desire to provide care, such  as for a pet, while incurring no ongoing expenses and employing min- imal space. [It] offers calculability, where quantity and speed are empha- sized over quality or personal satisfaction, in its development pattern and  through its ability to be reborn, repeatedly and identically. Predictability,  whereby events are predetermined and offers no surprises, is manifest in  the Tamagotchi through its preprogramming. Finally, control, in which  events are determined by nonhuman technology, is precisely what one  side of the interaction with the Tamagotchi entails (1999:291).  </page> <page sequence="22"> 1054 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 These interactions are not based on a desire for true emotional con- tact or engagement, but represent an end run on forming rich and involv- ing associations. They argue that relationships with virtual pets involve  only “para-social” or “unidirectional” interaction since these entities  lack individual personalities with which we engage reciprocally and  merely fill the empty role of a dependent (1999:293). In sum, they claim  our relationships with virtual pets are trivial, fleeting, and disposable,  thereby reducing attachments to those of means and ends.   Similarly, Zizek (1998) characterizes the relationship between hu- mans and Tamagotchis as inherently perverse and problematic. Nota- bly, he challenges the notion that virtual pets should be characterized  as interactive, suggesting instead that they are the “ultimate example of  ‘interpassivity’” (1998:143). Interpassivity refers to a way of relating  to others in which an active subject reacts to a passive object. It places  people in a position to respond to others’ actions and behaviours, where  the activity of one person or thing allows for the passivity of another. Yet  in truly interactive relationships, the active and passive roles are dynam- ic and changing whereas in interpassive ones, things are done “not ... to achieve something, but to prevent something from really happening,  really changing” (Zizek 2002:170). Pelletier (2005:318) observes that  interactivity and interpassivity are mutually constitutive. Interactivity al- lows me to be passive while being active through another (for example,  pressing buttons translates into in-game actions); through interpassivity,  I am active while being passive through another (I fulfill the game’s de- mands).   Zizek (1998:143) offers some examples of interpassivity, including the  Greek chorus or modern television’s “canned laughter” tracks. In both  cases, the entirety of spectators’ emotional experiences are taken over  and articulated for them. Likewise, with virtual pets, people feel the ap- propriate emotions, but only because signals emitted from the pets make  demands upon us. In this way, the Tamagotchi is not only the wholly  active entity in the relationship, it has reduced emotion to the symbolic  level, replacing altruistic compassion with a private, idiosyncratic ego- tism, all the while blurring the boundary between the two (1998:145).   Zizek also stresses that interpassivity extends beyond individual re- lationships. Interpassivity is the process whereby people’s actions are  appropriated so they become only responsive. This means that others  do our work for us, and in this case, the work is emotional in character.  Zizek states:  tamagochi [sic] is a machine which allows you to satisfy your need to love  </page> <page sequence="23"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1055 thy neighbour: you have a need to indulge in care for your neighbour, a  child, a pet? No problem: tamagochis enable you to do it without both- ering your actual neighbours with your intrusive compassion. (1998:145). When we act toward virtual pets (by feeding, playing, etc.), we are not  truly agents. Rather, we are acting through another even while our pas- sivity in the contact is invisible. Our only enjoyment is the Tamagotchi’s.  In other words, Tamagotchis give us the appearance of interaction,  but really there is no dynamic engagement. In many ways then, the  Tamagotchi mirrors our larger existence because interpassivity is empty  activity where we do things that are ultimately self-referential, to either  the self or larger extant ideology, which maintains the status quo of cap- italism (Zizek 2002). As Zizek puts it (1998:146):  perhaps therein resides the ultimate cause of tamagochi’s success: it pro- vides the best metaphor for what is fundamentally false and sterile in the  frenetic activity in which we are caught in our daily lives.   For Zizek (1998) and Bloch and Lemish (1999), virtual pets triumph- antly exemplify the success of consumer capitalism where relationships  are transitory and emptied of genuine consideration for the other. In  both works the economic imperative becomes hidden in the background  of adoration and affect. Interestingly, they both also explicitly distin- guish virtual pets from animate pets. Their condemnation of virtual pets  (Tamagotchis specifically) is made by way of comparison with organic  creatures, thus suggesting that contact with the latter is different, more  acceptable, or better than with the former. But what makes virtual pets  uniquely awful? Why are pet animals in these intimations revered and  personified more than ever; elevated almost to the level of the human? In  my view, neither piece makes a particularly strong case for condemning  virtual pets. Virtual pets have become the proverbial scapegoats of  their larger complaints with the trajectory of interpersonal life in what  Bauman (2003) has termed, “liquid modernity.” Their contention that  humans’ relationships with virtual pets are trivial, empty, and somehow  take the place of more profound ones ironically rehashes old discredited  criticisms leveled at the human-pet animal relationship (Serpell 1986).  It seems many worry about undermining a venerated sociality between  humans that never really existed in the first place (Latour 1988b).    What both pieces really seem to address are processes of alienation  where humans’ powers are experienced as forces emanating from an  objectified externality or where (hyper-reflexive) human emotion is ex- ploited for capitalist means (Hochschild 1983; Marx 1977). Zizek would  probably agree with these conclusions. Yet juxtaposing virtual pets with  </page> <page sequence="24"> 1056 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 “real” pets makes this inference uncertain. It should not be problematic  or incoherent to associate love and nurturance with digital and electronic  products. If we cannot do this, are we not privileging the natural over  the mechanistic with attention on such features as preprogrammed re- sponses, the origin of instigation, the privatization of sentiment, and the  simplification or simulation of emotion? We must begin to rethink what  we mean by sociality and the ways it is tied to love, isolation, power,  economic interests, and so on. Knorr-Cetina (1997) warns that we need  to move away from our fixation with humancentric models of connec- tion. She writes:  the untying of identities has been accompanied by the expansion of  object-centered environments which situate and stabilize selves, define  individual identity just as much as communities or families used to do,  and which promote ... social forms of binding self and other that feed on  and supplement the human forms of sociality studied by social scientists.  (1997:1)   While her focus is on objects of knowledge and expertise, it is nonethe- less applicable to my study of petness because it helps us reconsider how  we can problematize categories. Again, the focus must be on the human  dimension of feeling, which means relationships with pet animals are no  more important than those with virtual pets, or those between humans  more important than with animals, for that matter. And ultimately, the  commodification of love or intimacy has little to do with these qualities.  on PetneSS: limitationS and direCtionS for future Work  It may seem alarming to suggest we can talk about Tamagotchis and cats  equally as products of the investment of human emotion into objects.  Similarly, a focus on relations among humans, animals, and machines  may be seen as minimizing or ridiculing the profound devotion and love  many people feel for their pet animals. This paper may have even been  dismissed as but another piece in the anthropocentric-speciesist canon  because I neglect the subjectivity of animals. These responses are under- standable, and require some consideration.   My argument is anthropocentric since it proposes we can or should  talk about animals and other things in terms of their relationship to hu- mans. I am admittedly guilty of what Sanders and Arluke identify as a  rather restricted approach to studying animal-human relations that  has sought to capture the perspectives of the humans who interact with or  think about animals ... [without] any attempt to capture the perspectives  </page> <page sequence="25"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1057 of the animals themselves. (1993:378)   However, this anthropocentricity arises because I destabilize pets as sim- ply objects and instead identify them as objects of sentiment; socially  constructed entities defined through interaction. Everyone would/should  agree that both pets and nonpets exist, even if the basis for categorizing  them is contested. But how can we talk about the human perspectives  and practices that generate these particular creatures without implicat- ing the human-centred process by which this is done? We simply cannot  ignore the fact that animals’ destinies are largely the outcome of humans’  impulses, even if we do not agree with this. Consequently, I find myself  challenged to find another way to talk about petness in terms that are, at  the same time, neither essentialist nor anthropocentric. To my mind, the  former is possible while the latter is not; this project is fundamentally  different from the intersubjective empirical research Sanders and Arluke  advocate.  Despite this paper’s anthropocentrism, it is not speciesist. Definitions  vary, but generally the term refers to assigning different rights or val- ues to beings on the basis of their belonging to different biological spe- cies. Noske (1997b:189) further adds that speciesism is a prejudice that  eclipses individual distinctiveness. Again, pointing out that pets exist  and are predominantly nonhuman animals, but also other things, is not  a speciesist attitude. In addition, accounting for the socially constructed  relation of petness is an attempt to explore the way in which entities  become the focus of personal human interest. One of the salient features  of the pet relation is that things move from being universal exemplars of  their species/class to becoming unique individuals. My examination con- siders petness not as an expression of speciesism, but a challenge to it.  To be sure, Peter Singer (1975) dared his readers to consider all animals  in the same way as they do pets.7   I may be construed as speciesist because I have neglected to talk  about humans as potential pets or as nonhuman animals as potential pet- takers. I have no doubt that either can be the case. Copeland points out  that the term has its origins in human-human relations; that it was applied  to women, children, servants, and slaves before nonhumans (2003:112).  Undoubtedly, the power-domination and practice of infantilization that  characterizes human-pet animal relationships is also common between  humans. The task, which is simply beyond the scope of this paper, is to  7. It’s worth pointing out that Singer mentions the pet relationship in order to challenge  supposed animal lovers to think about the way they treat animals other than pets. In a  sense, he suggests that our love and care could/should be extended. However, he dis- misses emotionality as the basis for understanding animals’ rights and instead endorses  a rational approach to consideration.   </page> <page sequence="26"> 1058 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 examine and clarify how pet emotions differ from similar ones of more  egalitarian sentiment and affection. Certainly in the case of humans, one  complicated issue concerns the depth of specifically human free will and  agency. While there may be a long history of humans using and treat- ing other humans like pets (see Tuan 1984:115–161), such paternalistic  views may be vanishing.   At the same time, I recognize that there have been documented cases  of animals taking other animals as companions or pets, although Serpell  (1989:124–5) claims that this is most likely under conditions of captiv- ity or domestication. Patterson (1987) described one case in her account  of the Gorilla, Koko, and her pet cat, All Ball. Patterson characterizes  this as a pet relationship because Koko seemingly cared for the kitten  as if it were a baby gorilla, by feeding it, playing with it, grooming it,  and even nurturing it. Further, Koko purportedly exhibited signs of dis- tress and sadness upon All Ball’s death and has since taken other cats as  companions. To me, this suggests petness between nonhuman animals is  possible. But again, this is a matter for empirical research and beyond the  scope of my expertise insofar as it implicates zoological debates concern- ing the nature of animals’ emotions, cognitive capabilities, and so forth.   Whether I diminish or mock the profundity of animal-human affec- tion is somewhat trickier to address beyond the applicable comments  above. To a certain degree, my focus falls in line with many of the more  radical perspectives which recognize that the pet relation or even the  expression itself brings with it domination and mastery (Tuan 1984).  In response, some advocate shifting toward metaphors of companion- ship to highlight the “degree of caring, kindness, consideration and em- pathy we exchange with the nonhumans who share our lives” (Cope- land 2003:112; Smith 2003). But this is an easy way out. Petness is not  fundamentally different from “companion animalness” and I could have  talked about the latter here since even companion animals are the highly  dependent and subordinate “property” of their human friends (Irvine  2004a:5; Grier 2006:7).8 Ultimately, this objection stems from a refusal  to accept parallels between the way humans experience living creatures  and inorganic things. It is a dispute over whether relations between hu- mans and inorganic entities are truly social. This criticism is problematic  because it maintains that pet or companion animals are somehow special  because they are animate. Again, such a position should be rejected on  the grounds that it is essentialist. We cannot pretend animals are related  to in a truly distinct manner when some people’s experiences and some  8. I do not want to diminish the important (and necessary) gains fostered by the linguistic  shift from “pet” to “companion animal.” For more on the implications of this move, see  Irvine (2004b) or Grier (2006).  </page> <page sequence="27"> Beyond PetS: exPloring relational PerSPeCtiveS of PetneSS     1059 research projects suggest otherwise. The fact that inanimate pets’ behav- iour is governed by algorithms whereas animate pets’ behaviour origin- ates from something different seems to have no bearing on the invest- ment of emotion into, or attribution of human qualities onto, objects.   This is not to say that dogs, cats, hamsters, tamagotchis, furbies, and  so on, are not materially different, but materiality does not correlate dir- ectly with constitution. Many animate companions likely impose upon  our lives in more frequent and profound ways. It is the depth of care and  attachment, but not the nature of it, that may differentiate pet object-ani- mals and pet objects. For one thing, pet animals cannot be shut off. They  also require long-term emotional and financial commitment. Yet some  commonly accepted pets lack such qualities. Humans may live closely  with dogs, but fish exist in entirely separate worlds. Other small mam- mals such as guinea pigs also may be less sensitive to humans than cats,  and also arguably so are some robotic pets. Surely this does not mean  that these “lower” animals are not truly pets for millions of people. Just  as we cannot place the boundary between pets and nonpets at responsive  affect emanating from a self, we cannot place it at sentience. Entities are  pets if they are experienced as pets. Accordingly, artificial pets cannot be  excluded from the pet community. For many virtual pet owners, these  beings have intrinsic value. To ridicule this belief would declare that  humans’ relationships with animals are somehow natural and inherently  superior to those with machines. But as Serpell (1986) reminds us, this  same attitude has been used to describe people’s relationships with pets  as inferior to those with humans. Whether such feelings are logically  justifiable given that virtual pets are mechanical devices is a topic for  another paper.  ConCluSion This article has illustrated several ways in which sociologists could think  more comprehensively about the assumptions that underlie research on  pets. The concept of petness has been offered as one possibility for look- ing at this phenomenon more relationally, and I have tried to make this  case by comparing pet animals with artificial pets. I have also attempted  to situate petness within larger sociological perspectives concerning  relationships in contemporary society. However, this paper has not en- deavoured to develop a new theorization of petness. I am proposing we  should shift our focus from things, with their own ontological status, to  qualities that are (re)constructed and (re)established through interaction.  In making this argument, I am proposing that it is the relational quality  </page> <page sequence="28"> 1060 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 34(4) 2009 that is an important object of study and my intention is not to diminish  the value of the existing work in the field, only to suggest this view pro- vides a starting point for generating new questions. For instance, how  can we talk about petness without reifying the pet and giving it a coher- ent ontological status? Can or should we develop a theory of petness?  How can we know, understand and make sense of the idea of the pet?  These are difficult subjects, but ones I believe can help provide a better  understanding of a critical phenomenon that seems to be multiplying in  modern life. This is an imperative undertaking for the sociological disci- pline in general, and particularly for those working toward a more open  field that pays attention to an array of both living as well as nonliving  creatures. referenCeS Archer, John. 1997.
