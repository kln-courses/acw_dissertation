<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOODY AND THE IMPLOSION OF THE LITERACY THESIS JOHN HALVERSON University of Califomia In a series of influential books, articles and lectures over the past quarter-century, Jack Goody has probably been the foremost advocate of the 'literacy thesis', the pnrncipal claim of which is that the development of logical thought ('syllogistic reasoning', 'formal operations', 'higher psy- chological processes') is dependent on wn'ting, both in theory and in historical fact. The aim of the present cnrtique is to show that there is no inherent relationship between literacy and logic; that the possibilities for such development supposedly afforded uniquely by literacy also exist in non-literate discourse; that such possibilities, in any case, had no evident role in the historical beginnings of logic; that, in short, the 'cognitive' claims of the literacy thesis have no substance. In 1963 the 'literacy thesis,' as it has come to be known, was firnily launched more-or-less independently by Eric Havelock in his Preface to Plato (Havelock 1963) and by Jack Goody and Ian Watt in their influential article 'The con- sequences of literacy' (Goody &amp; Watt 1963). Both publications were chiefly concerned with the effects of alphabetic literacy on the Greek Enlightenment of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., both attributing a primary causal role to the invention and spread of the Greek alphabet. Since then, Havelock has reiterated the same thesis with essentially the same arguments in a series of books and articles (Havelock 1978; 1982; 1986). Watt, a distinguished critic and scholar of modem fiction, has never, so far as I know, returned to the subject. It is Goody, then, who has become the principal writer to amplify and explore the subject in a variety of ways and contexts (Goody 1968; 1977; 1987), abetted of course by others, notably Ong (1982) and Olson (1986). Unlike Havelock, who never altered his position in any significant way, Goody has continued to modify and qualify as well as to expand his earlier views. Again unlike Havelock, he has been responsive to criticism. He has, for instance, denied any advocacy of 'techno- logical determinism' (Street 1984), and indeed he is usually careful to write about what literacy 'makes possible', 'encourages' or 'facilitates', rather than what it 'causes'. He rejects the imputation (Finnegan 1973) of making a sharp dichot- omy, in the manner of Levy-Bruhl, between literate and non-literate mentalities, although he maintains, quite reasonably, that there are significant differences nevertheless. Nor is he a reductionist; his strong emphasis on literacy in the development of modern consciousness is intended to make up for its past neglect. There has, however, been a price to pay for his admirable scholarly caution, which is the literacy thesis itself After a quarter-century of being Man (N.S.) 27, 301-317</page><page sequence="2">302 JOHN HALVERSON rethought and revised, it has become so attenuated that it has virtually collapsed in on itself - hence my peculiar title. The consequences of literacy (Goody &amp; Watt 1963) The literacy thesis has more than one side to it, including a political-sociological side (in general, 'the effects of writing ... on the major institutions of society' [Goody 1977: ix], and more particularly, the democratization of Greece [Goody &amp; Watt 1963: 332]), but Goody's chief interest has clearly been in the connex- ion of literacy to what he calls modes of thought or cognitive processes. The major burden of the enterprise has been to establish this connexion, and it is this aspect of the thesis I propose to examine here. The earliest summnary of the argument is as follows: In oral societies the cultural tradition is transmitted almost entirely by face-to-face communica- tion; and changes in its content are accompanied by the homeostatic process of forgetting or transforming those parts of the tradition that cease to be either necessary or relevant. Literate societies, on the other hand, cannot discard, absorb, or transmute the past in the same way. Instead, their members are faced with permanently recorded versions of the past and its beliefs; and because the past is thus set apart from the present, historical enquiry becomes possible. This in turn encourages scepticism; and scepticism, not only about the legendary past, but about received ideas about the universe as a whole. From here the next step is to see how to build up and to test alternative explanations: and out of this there arose the kind of logical, specialized, and cumulative intellectual tradition of sixth-century Ionia. The kinds of analysis involved in the syllogism, and in the other forms of logical procedure, are clearly dependent upon writing (Goody &amp; Watt 1963: 344-5). Though the summary is presented mostly in generalized terms, it is the conclu- sion of an essay which is specifically about ancient Greece and should be approached from that perspective. The 'homeostatic' principle, which seems to me generally sound, is well illustrated in the text by examples, from two African tribes, of genealogical information altered in oral tradition over a period of two or three generations to accommodate later circumstances. The comparable Greek oral tradition is embodied in Homer and Hesiod and very dubiously presumed to be 'the orthodox cultural tradition' (p. 322, emphasis added). Once set down in writing between 750 and 650 B.C., it is said, the Homeric poems were no longer subject to typical oral revision, and therefore served as a catalyst for scepticism. There are many problems with this. The first is whether the comparison is even appropriate. Does it make sense to compare epic stories about the remote past to tribal genealogies? Was there anything in those old stories that needed revision in the sixth century to accommodate current realities? The sceptics referred to, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, were intellectuals with advanced theo- logical ideas who, like Plato later, objected to unedifying stories about the gods and to naive anthropomorphism. But it is certain that such popular stories and attitudes prevailed quite outside any influence of Homer and would have pre- vailed had the Homeric poems never existed, let alone been written down. The content of tradition is not determined by the speculations of a handful of ec- centric philosophers. From the general point of view, there was probably nothing in Homer that needed silent forgetting, for there was nothing there - no charter myths or genealogies - that had any direct bearing on sixth-century realities. In this respect, then, there is no meaningful comparison between Tiv genealogies and Homeric epics. In any case, it should be noted that only</page><page sequence="3">JOHN HALVERSON 303 Xenophanes directly reproaches Homer for his representation of the deities. Heraclitus disapproved of Homer - and of everyone else for that matter - but does not say why. Hecataeus thought that many of the tales told by the Greeks were ridiculous, but there is no reason to assume he was referring to Homer. Such tales were more likely to be oral stories of the kind that Thucydides re- ferred to when he said that in composing his history he did not just write down the first story that came along (History of the Peloponnesian War, I.48). The earliest historians whose works have survived, Herodotus and Thucy- dides, found nothing to object to in Homer. Thucydides suspected that Homer might have exaggerated sometimes just because he was a poet (I.10), but both historians accept Homer's account of the Trojan War as basically factual. Their scepticism, which was considerable, was reserved mainly for their oral sources. And it was oral sources that provided the great bulk of the material they re- corded; they made little attempt to study documents even when these were available. But the historical subject for both writers was events of the recent past, which for the most part had not been recorded in writing anyway. It is, there- fore, quite clear that the historical inquiries of Herodotus and Thucydides did not depend on, or arise in response to, permanent written records, nor was their scepticism a result of analyzing documents. There seems to be no justification for the idea that either philosophical or historical scepticism had anything to do with a written Homer, or with any writing. Neither is there any evident reason to implicate writing in the construc- tion or testing of 'alternative explanations'. I assume the allusion is to the early ordian cosmogonists who proposed naturalistic explanations of the world as al- ternatives to mythical accounts. Here we face the same problems as we did with the theological critics. Had Homer not been written down, would cosmic my- thology have been pruned out of cultural tradition by the homeostatic principle? It is hardly imaginable. If the loniali physicists were responding to myths at all, these would have been sufficiently abundant without being written. But there is little indication that they had any interest in either mythology or Homer. And the same can be said for the lyric poets of the same period. Both the natural philosophers and the poets appear to break from tradition, but such departures required no examination of texts or historical inquiry. A 'cumulative intellectual tradition' is unquestionably aided immensely by writing. To some extent it is perfectly possible under conditions of strictly oral transmission, but it is significantly constrained by the limitations of memory, both individual and collective. Even with literacy, however, such a tradition need not entail the development of logical thought, certainly not formal logic; millen- nia of scribal literacy in the Near East did not propel an evolution in any such direction. Of course, that does not disprove the contention that syllogistic rea- soning is 'clearly dependent on writing', for the argument is not meant to be deterministic. On the face of it, however, this is a puzzling claim. A syllogism is just a sequence of statements about inclusive and exclusive relations that would appear to be quite indifferent to whether such statements are spoken or written. Nor is the argument for the claim very illuminating. It begins with the idea that 'writing establishes a different kind of relationship between the word and its referent, a relationship that is more general and abstract, and less closely</page><page sequence="4">304 JOHN HALVERSON connected with the particularities of person, place and time, than obtains in oral communication' (Goody &amp; Watt 1963: 321). 'In oral cultures, words ... may hardly be conceived of as separate entities, divorced both from the rest of the sentence and its social context. But once given the physical reality of writing, they take on a life of their own' (p. 330). To me at least, it is far from self-evident that a written word has a more general and abstract relationship to its referent than a spoken word. Whether I read or hear the sentence 'A dog was running down the road', for example, the referents seem to be in no more or less abstract relationship to the words in one case than in the other. Connexions with particularities of time, place and person can vary as much in one medium as in another. Only if a conversational model is presup- posed for the oral medium is immediacy distinctive, but such a model is hardly justified since a great deal of important oral discourse (such as story, myth and ritual) is not in that mode. Of course some words are more abstract than others, and no doubt a literate tradition generally has more such words than an oral one, but that is not the argument presented - nor should it be, for syllogisms do not require an abstract vocabulary. It is also difficult to believe that in oral societies words cannot be conceived as separate entities. Perhaps people in such societies are less word-conscious, but they can use words in isolation. Goody has sub- sequently acknowledged this point: 'I do not mean to imply that oral speech is "wordless", that morphemes cannot be and are not isolated, especially in the language-learning phase' (Goody 1977: 115). It must also be asked in what way writing enhances word-consciousness, especially when most early writing, partic- ularly Greek, did not separate words in the first place. What kind of independent life do written words have? True, much Greek thought was concerned with word meanings, but are we to suppose that no-one before Socrates ever asked the meaning of a word? None of these questions is satisfactorily answered, or even raised, by Goody and Watt. But the more important question is what, in any event, has all this discussion of words to do with the development of logic? Even if everything said about writing and words were valid, what relevance would it have? The syllogism is taken here as the paradigm for logical procedures. What is there, then, about the syllogism that presupposes or requires an abstract relationship between word and referent, or some special word-consciousness? Consider the following statements: 'All Trojan warriors are dangerous; Hector is a Trojan warrior; therefore Hector is dangerous'. This can be easily expressed in the lan- guage of Homer - it could probably even be put into hexameters - and would surely be intelligible to a preliterate Greek. Though he would no doubt find it a peculiar utterance, there would be nothing unfamiliar in the word-referent rela- tionships nor anything to test his word-consciousness. Thus far, it is not evident that writing has anything to do with the formulation or comprehension of the syllogism. The further attempts of Goody and Watt to support the connexion between writing and logic seem to me equally dubious, as for example their statement that 'the written word suggests an ideal of definable truths which have an inherent autonomy and permanence' (1963: 330). How in the world does the written word 'suggest' such an ideal? We are not told. Moreover, logical procedure, to Goody and Watt, 'seems essentially literate'</page><page sequence="5">JOHN HALVERSON 305 because writing liberates consciousness from 'the tyranny of the present' (p. 330, quoting Spengler): what this means, if anything, is not explained. Again, it is said that Plato's Republic or Aristotle's Analytics could not have been created, delivered or understood in oral form. This claim is arguable, but even if granted, it would apply not to logical procedures per se but to treatises on logical procedure. The former can certainly be taught orally, and we are given no reason why they could not be formulated orally. It is worth recalling, too, that the Republic is represented as an oral dialogue - apparently Plato felt there was nothing incredible in that - and Aristotle's work is very probably taken from lecture notes and his treatise meant for oral delivery (Barnes 1982: 3). Again, we are told of Plato's analogy, in the Statesman, between children learning to read letter by letter and adults gaining knowledge example by example; and that Aristotle uses the letters of the alphabet to symbolize propositions. But these are nothing more than fortuitous conveniences which tell us nothing about any inherent relationship between writing and logic. Plato did not need the analogy to make his point, and Aristotle could have used any symbols for his purpose. There is no argument here. That, alas, seems to be all there is: a thin tissue of vague suggestions, gratuitous assumptions and unsupported generalizations. The hypothesis that there might be an intrinsic relationship between alphabetic writing and formal-operational thought is both provocative and attractive. The temporal relationship between the two developments is inevitably suggestive of the possibility of a causal rela- tionship. But post hoc ergo propter hoc is not a sufficient argument and, in the end, that is all we are left with: no other real case has been made. The domestication of the savage mind (Goody 1977) Perhaps aware of the insufficiency of argument in the original essay, Goody returned to the subject fourteen years later to devote an entire book to it. The explicit goal of The domestication of the savage mind is to analyze 'the effects of wnting on "modes of thought" (or cognitive processes)' (p. ix). It examines 'the role of changes in the mode of communication in the development of cogni- tive structures and processes' (p. 36) and how 'literate procedures ... have influenced the cognitive structures and processes that have developed subsequent to the advent of writing' (p. 53). Goody begins by reiterating and summarizing the earlier view that 'logic', in the sense of 'an instrument of analytic proce- dures', seemed to be 'a function of writing, since it was the setting down of speech that enabled man clearly to separate words, to manipulate their order and to develop syllogistic forms of reasoning; these latter were seen as specifically literate rather than oral' (p. 11). This does nothing to clarify matters; in fact the addition of word-order manipulation only adds further mystery, for the 'setting down of speech' implies the preservation of spoken syntax. However, he goes on to develop a partially new argument; this is a 'specific proposition' that 'writ- ing, and more especially alphabetic literacy, made it possible to scr4tinize discourse in a different kind of way; ... this scrutiny favoured the increase in scope of critical activity, and hence of rationality, scepticism, and logic'. Freed from the problem of memory storage, one could study 'static text', which enabled one 'to stand back from his creation and examine it in a more abstract, generalized, and "rational" way' (p. 37). This difference of perception is clearly</page><page sequence="6">306 JOHN HALVERSON central to Goody's argument, and it is much more than the elementary difference between visual and aural activity: writing 'creates the possibility of what is almost a different kind of critical examination' (p. 49, emphasis added). It may be that, in general, inconsistencies and contradictions are easier to detect in writing than in speech, but much depends on the quality and content of particular discourse and attitudes of reception. If we have strong feelings about the subject or about the person expounding it, whether writer or speaker, we often have an equally strong tendency selectively to read or hear only what we want. Any ambiguities - and there are always ambiguities - tend to be resolved according to the initial frame of mind. In this situation, whether the object of attention is a written text or a speech is not likely to make any difference. Again, a skilful writer wishing, consciously or not, to disguise inconsistency can throw up a verbal smokescreen as effectively as any orator. The detectability of contra- diction depends in the first place on memory, whether of something heard or read. Most of us have probably engaged in intellectual arguments lasting several hours in a purely oral context, which are frequently punctuated with such state- ments as 'A while ago you said so-and-so, now you're saying just the opposite', or 'Now you're using the word x in a completely different way from the way you did before'. This kind of detection of contradiction, real or supposed, is very familiar. Goody uses as an effective example of visual scanning Margaret Masterson's discovery of twenty-one variant usages of the word 'paradigm' in Thomas Kuhn's The structure of scientfic revolutions, for which she made and used a visual subject-index. So thorough an analysis, it is true, would defy the aural memory capacity of even the most accomplished mnemonist, but evidently it was her memory, her ongoing awareness of inconsistent usage, that led her to her indexing task. The detection of inconsistency, then, was of exactly the same kind as occurs commonly in certain oral situations. And so, in principle, was the proof In the oral situation we would have only our memory to check, which would indeed be most unlikely to produce such exhaustive results, but the men- tal process seems to be identical. If the sort of thing that Masterson did is all that Goody means when he says that writing permits 'a different kind of critical examination', I suppose no one would argue with him. But there seem to be no implications in any of this for distinctive 'cognitive structures and processes'. In another formulation of the same idea, Goody writes: 'it is certainly easier to perceive contradictions in writing than it is in speech, partly because one can formalize the statements in a syllogistic manner and partly because writing arrests the flow of oral converse so that one can compare side by side utterances that have been made at different times and at different places' (pp. 11-12). As already suggested, it seems to me that ease of perception in either mode depends, ini- tially, on alertness and memory. The chief difference is in the ease and reliability of verifying suspected anomalies. It is not necessary, and certainly not normal, to syllogize statements in order to perceive contradiction. It may in some instances be a useful ploy of rebuttal, but no-one needs to be a logician, or even to have heard of a syllogism, to perceive a non sequitur. And in any case it is no more difficult to syllogize in an oral context than in a written one. Side-by-side com- parisons can be made in thought and speech without anything to look at - it is an ordinary process of ordinary oral life - though, as always, the stability of</page><page sequence="7">JOHN HALVERSON 307 written text provides greater accuracy. In some more extraordinary circum- stances, oral comparisons from memory alone can reach remarkable complexity. The tradition of Talmudic scholarship, for example, which for several centuries was entirely oral, requires the recollection of innumerable rabbinic statements and their side-by-side comparison. This is the essence of Talmudic study. And according to at least one Jewish scholar, this procedure, far from leading to abstract thought, is characterized by 'a deliberate evasion of abstract thinking based on abstract concepts' (Steinsaltz 1976: 228). This does not mean, of course, that rabbis are illogical - quite the contrary - but that logical processes do not require abstraction. Rabbinic logic, like Platonic logic to a great extent, operates on concrete models. It is not clear, then, that the perception of anomalies in discourse is signifi- cantly enhanced by writing - though their verification undoubtedly is. Nor is it evident that formalization procedures are relevant strategies in either mode; or that comparisons are modally distinctive. Once again, cognitive structures and processes seem to be unaffected by writing. But now Goody takes a new ap- proach by examining lists and their significance (1977: 81). While not denying that lists sometimes occur in oral cultures, he finds them a much more distinctive feature of literate societies, appearing with great frequency in the earliest eras of Sumerian and Babylonian writing. Lists have the peculiarity of isolating items, especially words, from normal discursive contexts. Thus decontextualized, they rely on discontinuity, as opposed to the continuity of normal speech (hence writing in this, the earliest of its major uses, was not a transcription of dis- course); and thus visualized, they encouraged the ordering of the items, an activity 'which encourages the activities of historians and the observational sciences, as well as on a more general level, favouring the exploration and defini- tion of classificatory schemas' (p. 108). Lists, then, represent 'formal, cognitive and linguistic operations which this new technology of the intellect opened up' (p. 81). This is an interesting idea, for taxonomy or categorical classification is fun- damental to scientific and logical thought. Lists are not uncommon in oral societies (Vansina 1973: 151-4), but do not necessarily have categorical potential- ity. Such are the more-or-less random inventories elicited by anthropologists or, say, our own shopping lists, where items are listed merely as they occur to one. Likewise, naturally ordered lists, such as genealogies and itineraries, where the order is predetermined by then-to-now or here-to-there algorithms, can have little heuristic value. Closer to categorical listing would be the 'impressively long list' of Vai clans grouped 'according to their representative chiefdoms' obtained by Goody, Scribner and Cole (Goody 1987: 207). Lists not preorganized, so to speak, probably do not often find their way into narrative or even into oral tradition generally, but one interesting example occurs in the Mwindo 'epic' of the Nyanga (Biebuyck &amp; Mateene 1971); it is an incantation by the hero to divest his enemies of everything they own, and constitutes what the translators call an 'inventory of Nyanga material culture' (1971: 87). The items are men- tioned as follows: pastes, animals, meats, wood, fire, water, jars, clothes, wooden dishes, beds, wicker plates, salt, chickens, goats, cattle, dogs, banana groves, tobacco, pipes, spears, adzes, billhooks, pruning knives, little pruning knife, dog</page><page sequence="8">308 JOHN HALVERSON bells, bags, razors, butea-rings, necklaces, needles, fire drill, hoes, [cooking] pots, baskets, mumanga-piercers, bisara-billhooks, bellows, hammers, blacksmiths, nkendo-knives, raphia palm trees, and drums (1971:84-7). The initial purpose of the incantation is to transport magically the enemy's food into Mwindo's camp; so the list begins with food items, continues with cooking equipment, interspers- ing clothes and beds, returns to food animals (which include the dogs, I assume), digresses to tobacco and pipes, and continues with a considerable diversity of objects and people. It is easy to see how items cluster in small category groups and how subsequent items and groups are suggested by conceptual associations. The list is clearly not random, but the sense of ordering by categories is still very inchoate. This list is particularly interesting because it is so much like some of the earliest written lists from Sumeria. For example, the me list1 given by Kramer (1963: 116) has the same features of clustering, association and afterthought that characterize Mwindo's list. The same is true of the 'Proto-Lu' lexical list of mainly occupational names which includes many barely relevant items that 'ap- pear to have entered the series by an attraction process', such as technical names for fiurrows following names of farmers. These show up both in clusters and, 'almost everywhere', as isolated entries (Civil 1969: 25). Most were eliminated in later recensions (Civil 1969: 25, 87; Goody 1977: 96), suggesting a scribal interest in, and awareness of, categorical sets that visual inspection no doubt facilitated. But all this means is that the scribes tidied up certain lists on the basis of what they already knew; no new cognitive development is implied. Even this seems exceptional. Clustering and association are typical where lists are not confined to limited categonres. This is very evident in so-called law codes (which are probably not in fact codifications) such as the 'Laws of Eshnunna' and the famous 'Code of Hammurabi' (Pritchard 1969; Saggs 1962: ch. 7), in which laws are associ- ationally grouped but in which any systematic ordering of such groups is lacking. In general, ancient Near Eastern lists or list-like documents show few traces of vertical, hierarchical principles of ordination, of a kind that would make them truly distinctive from the products of oral cultures. Lists abounded in the ancient civilizations for practical, largely administrative purposes that were absent from simpler societies, but they do not seem to reveal any notable differences 'in modes of thought, or reflective capacities, or ... cognitive growth' (Goody 1977: 111). Systematic, hierarchically ordered classification had to await the efforts of Plato and Aristotle. Plato's 'method of division', expounded in the Sophist and the Statesman, seems to be the first major attempt at logical classification. That it was in any way inspired by list-making practices is extremely doubtful; it appears far more likely that it arose out of his reflections on the Socratic problem of definition, in which neither lists nor even literacy has any self-evident role. The interface between the written and the oral (Goody 1987) The disintegration of the literacy thesis becomes increasingly evident in The interface between the written and the oral. In the second chapter of this book Goody returns to the question of Greek alphabetic literacy mainly in response to G.E.R. Lloyd's treatise on the origins of Greek science (Lloyd 1979). Without denying literacy an important role in this development, Lloyd is inclined to subordinate it</page><page sequence="9">JOHN HALVERSON 309 to other social and political factors. Goody agrees on the whole with Lloyd's views and is anxious not to appear as an advocate of single causation (pp. 64-5), but he takes the opportunity to reaffirm and expand his earlier arguments. Some of this is merely recapitulation and open to the same objections as before. The analysis of texts ('a different form of scrutiny'- p. 77), for instance, is again assigned basic importance without further elucidation of just what makes it so special and indeed without any attempt to show that textual analysis per se played any significant historical role in the development of Greek thought. Was Plato's thought sparked off by the visual examination of written texts? There is no evidence that it was. But it is certain that the oral dialogues of Socrates were inspirational, and highly likely that oral discourse in the Academy was a great impetus to his intellectual development. Even Aristotle, who does refer to texts, is rather proud to point out that in the area of formal logic nothing was written before him (Sophistical Refutations 180b). In a similar vein, Goody rephrases the argument that literacy breeds scepticism. The oral mind tends to forget many exceptions to favoured generalities; it is 'systematic recording ... that allows us to be "generally sceptical"' (1987: 69). It is true that written records, if they are consulted, may allow us to be more accurate in certain judgements, but sceptical attitudes hardly depend on them. Political scepticism, for example, is often rife among literates and non-literates alike and seldom has anything to do with the availability of written records. There may not even be any record of the unkept promises, the visible corruption and op- pression that turn ordinary non-literate people into political cynics. In any case, it is not clear that scepticism per se is a necessary foundation of rationality. Aqui- nas was a profoundly rational thinker, but is seldom referred to as a 'sceptic'. No doubt Goody is thinking of the attitudes of modem science, where an open, questioning mind and a demand for evidence and proof are indeed basic, but this need not entail a 'generally sceptical' frame of mind - witness Newton the alchemist. And it is at least arguable that the scientific attitude owes far less to literacy than to observation and experiment. Of course Goody is right to point out that some areas of science require a long record of observations. He notes that the 'Mesopotamians failed to predict the appearance of Halley's comet largely because they did not have a sufficient run of ... recorded observations' (1987: 76). But this is not a matter of means, but of practice. Babylonian astronomers had for millennia the necessary means to record their observations. Clearly their 'failure', if it was that, had nothing to do with writing.2 'Regularities', Goody tells us, 'may suggest a sense of causality but these only become a law of causality when they are explicitly formulated' (1987: 76). Dis- regarding the fact that by 'law' he can only and redundantly mean 'explicit formulation' (it takes a good deal more than explicit formulation to make a physical law), there is no reason why such a formulation may not be made orally. Whether it is spoken or written, there is no difference whatever in the statement 'Halley's comet reappears approximately every seventy-six years'. It makes a great deal of practical difference whether the statement, or the memory, is preserved for seventy-six years, and this is certainly where written records come in handy, but no cognitive implications are involved.</page><page sequence="10">310 JOHN HALVERSON Goody believes that the difference in 'forms of argument' between oral and literate societies is that 'they do not take the same shape; there is not the same degree of formalization' (1987: 72). So long as we are talking about 'societies', this is probably true enough, empirically. But he goes on to argue on the basis of capability, which is another and much more explicitly cognitive matter. 'Try under oral conditions', he proposes rhetorically, 'to formalize a general proposi- tion using concrete cases' (p. 72). Responding to the challenge, we may observe, in the first place, that there is no reason to suppose that general propositions cannot be stated with ease 'under oral conditions'; proverbs, a favourite genre of oral tradition, are replete with such generalizations. In the second place, the use of concrete cases to exemplify general propositions (leaving it to the listener to make the appropriate generalization) is also a common practice, in both oral and literate cultures. 'Try, too', he goes on, 'expressing ideas in the form of the syllogism. Try comparing versions of the same story and perceiving the diversity and contradictions'. But what, I would also ask rhetorically, could be easier? It is not difficult to formulate a syllogism orally, and the critical comparison of differ- ent stories is a commonplace of everyday oral life, evident for example in the reception of gossip, rumour and conflicting reports of witnesses to events. 'Try formulating opposition and analogy', Goody again urges, 'without the use of graphemes'. Here he is evidently not referring to the expression of opposition and analogy, which is palpably unproblematic, but to the symbolic codification of their logical principles of operation, as in the formula 'A:B::C:D'. But such formulae are no more than conveniences for certain forms of highly specialized discourse. The principle of analogy can equally well be formulated by a state- ment such as 'two things alike in some respects may be inferred to be alike in other respects'. It is only in the sense that the letters of the alphabet happen to have been utilized, from Aristotle on, to symbolize categories or propositions that one can say that 'this type of formalization is implicit in writing itself' (1987: 72). But this is a trivial conclusion, though Goody seems to be persuaded of its importance. Later, he appears to apply the same kind of reasoning to the development of the formal syllogism, which 'involves a graphic layout' (p. 221) or 'graphic repre- sentation' (p. 279). This has no more than tautological validity: if a syllogism is represented graphically, it involves a graphic layout. But of course a syllogism does not require graphic representation. Again, if a syllogism uses letters to sym- bolize terms or propositions, then the existence of an alphabet is presupposed. But syllogistic formulae do not require the use of alphabetic letters. The state- ment, 'If a given category always entails a certain attribute, then any member of that category will have that attribute', formulates one kind of syllogism just as well as 'All A are B; C is an A; therefore C is B', and requires neither graphemes nor even writing. If I seem to belabour the obvious, it is only because Goody has so assiduously obscured it. By the end of his re-examination of the Greek liter- acy thesis it has been effectively reduced to the pallid claim that the Hellenic developments of logic and logical thought were 'linked, in the long run, to communication in the written mode' (p. 76). If there remained any life in the idea of an intrinsic connexion between literacy and the development of 'higher psychological functions', the coup de grace</page><page sequence="11">JOHN HALVERSON 311 was given by the researches of Scribner and Cole (1981) among the Vai people of Liberia. Since the pioneering investigations by Luria in the 1930s (Luria 1976), it has become clear that the ability of people to reason in hypothetical, abstract and syllogistic modes is closely related to their schooling, especially in 'Western' types of education. Luria found that illiterate Russian peasants had great difficulty in grasping simple syllogisms whereas others from the same socio- economic background, if they had had some schooling, were much more capable. The same phenomena have since been observed in other parts of the world. Since Western education is founded on learning to read and write, it was perhaps natural to suppose (as Goody and others did) that literacy was the deci- sive factor in the development of logical thinking. Others surmised that the highly artificial and decontextualized atmosphere of the schoolroom was more relevant.3 Scribner and Cole found a rare, perhaps unique, opportunity to study the cognitive effects of literacy separate from formal schooling, for the Vai had developed their own writing system that was learned informally in the home independently of other kinds of learning. Thus many Vai people were literate but unschooled. Others from the same background attended English schools taught in the Western tradition, and yet others learned Arabic from traditional Qu'ranic teachers. The Vai Literacy Project was surely one of the most exten- sive, thorough and meticulous studies of its kind ever undertaken, and the results were devastating for any 'strong' form of the literacy thesis. Of all the survey tasks, logic problems proved the most predictable and demonstrated the strongest effects of schooling. Not only did amount of school increase the number of correct answers, but it contributed to the choice of theoretical explanations, over and above correct answers. Schooling was the only background characteristic to improve performance; neither Vai script nor Arabic literacy had an effect on either measure (Scribner &amp; Cole 1981: 127). What about the effects of nonschooled literacies? These surely disappoint the grand expecta- tions and lofty theories that inspired us to undertake this line of investigation. Under condi- tions obtaining in Vai society, neither syllabic Vai scnpt nor Arabic alphabetic literacy was associated with what are considered the higher-order intellectual skills. Neither literacy en- hanced the use of taxonomic skills on any task designed to test categorization. Nor did either contribute to a shift toward syllogistic reasomng (1981: 131-2). In a lengthy and elaborate response to Scribner and Cole's work, Goody (1987: ch. 10) again covers the ground from Sumeria to Vygotsky, but the upshot of it seems to be a denial that he had ever suggested any 'unmediated con- sequences' of literacy - that is, that a mastery of writing would lead directly to syllogistic reasoning (p. 221) - but rather that such reasoning was in the first place, in its origin, a consequence of literacy. The point, at least in principle, is well taken, but it leaves Goody very much back where he started from, that is, still trying to demonstrate an intrinsic relationship between writing and logic. And he has nothing further to offer. We are told once again that 'oral man lacked not logical reasoning but certain tools of intellectual operation that defined the Greek notion of "logic"' (p. 220). These include the ability to lay side by side different documents and so to perceive contradictions 'which in the oral mode would be virtually impossible to spot', 'critical attention to a text read that would be impossible to apply to an utterance heard', the syllogism 'that involves a graphic layout' (pp. 220-1), and the non-syntactic use of words in lists. The negative conclusion that none of these supposed cognitive potentialities has been</page><page sequence="12">312 JOHN HALVERSON realized in the case of Vai literacy does not in itself invalidate the literacy thesis, which is explicitly nondeterministic; but the positive conclusion that it is a cer- tain type of schooling, not literacy, that develops the kind of rationality in question damages the thesis severely, though perhaps not yet mortally. I would suggest that the relevance of schooling here is that in Western educa- tion since antiquity only a certain kind of reasoning - basically Aristotelian - has been generally acceptable in schools. It is not that logic is directly taught, for it seldom is, but that only such logical kind of discourse is approved and rewarded. Thus it is neither the decontextualized atmosphere of the schoolroom nor learn- ing to read and write that is responsible, though both may be contributory, but simply an age-long expectation that academic discourse will be conducted in such a mode - an expectation that is not characteristic of other, non-Western educational traditions. It should not be surprising, then, that young people should fairly soon accommodate to such expectations in a Western school environment. If this view is correct, it is evident that the modes of Western rationality could be inculcated entirely through oral means without any recourse to reading and writing. That it is largely done this way in schools - everywhere - is a fact with which I think Goody would agree. There remains the argument that formal, logical reason would never have arisen in the first place except for the historical fact of Greek literacy, but the burden of the present critique has been to demonstrate that this argument has not been made. I have tried to show, sometimes using Goody's own material as evidence, that many of the things deemed 'impossible' in oral culture are in fact not only possible but also achieved in reality. I have moreover tried to show that most of the features of literacy on which Goody focuses - visual comparison, perception of contradiction, scepticism, word-isolation, lists - have no de- monstrable bearing on the issue, either theoretically or empirically. To return to but one example, that of lists, we know in the first place that non-literate people do make lists easily when they have occasion to do so; in the second place, we have no evidence that written lists have any theoretical role in the generation of psychological categories; in the third place, there is no historical indication that the development of Greek rationality had any relation to listing practices. What is left of the literacy thesis? In its original intention of implicating writ- ing in the formation of 'higher psychological functions', I would say, little or nothing. But in his latest attempts to salvage the theory, Goody has turned it into something else. Now it has become a question of the cognitive skills, rather than the cognitive abilities, that derive from writing, skills that should be 'related to particular socio-historical situations' (1987: 218). He mentions the making and use of crossword puzzles, grammars, dictionaries, maps and, earlier, shaped verse as examples of cognitive skills dependent on writing. A dictionary, for example, 'affects our understanding of the world and its use can be counted as a cognitive skill available to literates' (p. 244). 'For literates', he goes so far as to say, 'formal operations, including thinking itself, involve the use of pen and paper. Without such external props, one cannot express one's thoughts or communicate them to others' (pp. 256-7). What can one say to such strange assertions as this except that perhaps by 'literates' he means intellectuals who write many books? Most ordi- nary literate people rarely do their thinking on paper and have other people to</page><page sequence="13">JOHN HALVERSON 313 talk to. As for the rest, it would appear that the literacy thesis has been reduced to the obvious and the trivial. It surely does not require so great a weight of professorial learning to convince us that crossword puzzles presuppose literacy and a particular kind of skill that arises from literacy. What are the cognitive implications of this latest version of the thesis? We may, if we like, call reading, writing, using a dictionary, and solving a crossword puzzle 'cognitive' skills, but do any of these involve different 'modes of thought' or 'cognitive structures' from those of non-literates? These are the terms Goody formerly used to describe the aspects of cognition in which he was interested. Of course, in some sense crossword puzzles, for instance, do require a new way of thinking about words, and indeed a new way of thinking about the world to the extent that crossword puzzles become a part of the world. But this is true of any novelty that comes into our experience, and since life presents us with an endless stream of novelties, our modes of thought would have continually to change to keep up with them. Whatever 'cognition' might mean, it cannot mean anything like this. Goody's view conflates what we think about and how we think; only the latter is the concern of cognitive theory. And it is extremely unlikely that solving a crossword puzzle or using a dictionary involves cognitive structures different from any other problem-solving or search procedures. The distinction between ability and skill may be valid in itself, but takes us nowhere in argument, which is still that 'formal reasoning' is 'critically dependent upon the existence of writ- ing and of a written tradition' (Goody 1987: 256). And whether it is a question of ability or skill, the proposition has never been demonstrated and is probably untrue. Goody closes his book with an interesting and, as always, informed essay on the influence of writing on language, especially spoken language, and on how people interact with their world. It takes as its starting point once again the possible genetic relationship between writing and rationality, now, however, couched in more tentative terms: 'If we assume some relation between lan- guage-using and the higher psychological functions, there is an a priori case for assuming that subsequent changes in the means and mode of communication would affect cognitive processes in parallel ways', the important change being of course from oral to written language (1987: 260); 'if we can show an effect of writing on language itself, given its role in the "higher psychological processes", we would have found an important influence upon ways individuals interact with the world' (p. 262). The first condition, the assumption that language influences the 'higher psychological processes' - the phrase is Vygotsky's (1962) - would probably be generally granted. The second conditional statement is noncommit- tally vague, in both its apodosis and protasis. Surely not just any effect of writing on language will do, and surely not every interaction with the world will repre- sent higher processes. And in fact no effects of writing relevant to these processes are adduced, nor do the interactions discussed reflect them. By the end of the essay, its initial goals seem, perhaps fortunately, to have largely given way to a fascination with diglossic phenomena. However, one unassailable point emerges, and this is that reading can radically alter one's thoughts, emotions and be- haviour. There is no doubt about it. We all know this from our own experience, and there are endless historical and fictional accounts to verify or support it in</page><page sequence="14">314 JOHN HALVERSON others. One might even acquire formal-operational thinking abilities (or skills) from reading. But the only critical question is whether the particular channel of communication, that is, writing, is decisive. And the answer is clearly, no. Had Don Quixote or Madame Bovary been unable to read and only heard romances and novels read to them, would the psychological effects have been different? Could not Kant simply have been told about Hume's theories and still have been awakened from his 'dogmatic slumbers'? Did blind and Braille-less Milton have to read the Bible himself to compose and dictate Paradise Lost? The medium of communication - which is the issue here - has no intrinsic significance in the communication of ideas or the development of logical thought processes. Writing does have an effect on a language considered as a whole, that is, including the whole range of spoken and written forms used in a given language group. Written, especially literary, language often develops more elaborate, com- plex and artificial styles. When the spoken language and the written language diverge to the point of diglossia, they may even have different grammars. Hence the whole language is altered, though not necessarily the language of every individual. But languages do not think, only individuals do, and the question is whether the assimilation of the complexities and artifices of written language leads to more logical thought. Certainly there is no necessary connexion. A Cicer- onian mastery of every available device and nuance of language may produce nothing more than fluent nonsense. Eloquence is no guarantee of sound think- ing. What needs to be assimilated from written language to make us logical is logic. But written language in general is no more logical than speech. Though it may be more carefully formulated, both in syntax and in lexicon, this does not in itself make it logical. What exactly is there, then, about writing that affects the higher processes via language? Goody gives no explicit answer that I can find, but when the question is put in this way, it becomes evident that he is simply presupposing the same argument as always, with no more credibility, that logic derives from writing. It is old wine - or small beer - in a new bottle. Conclusion In recent years, we have become increasingly aware that the consequences of literacy depend entirely on the uses to which literacy is put and that both the uses and the consequences are extremely variable. Does literacy have a 'liberating' or 'alienating' effect? In some circumstances it does. Maxwell (1983), for example, has described the cultural fragmentation of a north Zambian people under the impact of Christian and British education over the past century. Attributing this alienation to literacy tout simple, however, he does not seem to realize that it is due to the content of what has been written and read that people are being taught, directly or indirectly, to abandon traditional ways. In other circumstances and in other places, the effects of literacy can be just the opposite. In Madagas- car, a similar literate legacy has been used to bolster tradition: 'Literacy has not transformed the nature of Merina knowledge - it has confirmed it' (Bloch 1989: 26). Here, indigenous oral tradition has been directly transferred to writing. Does literacy promote scepticism? Evidently not in the North Indian Brahmanical tradition. In this context, 'the written form - so far from promoting scepticism -</page><page sequence="15">JOHN HALVERSON 315 provides a certain immunity against it' (Parry 1989: 63). Greatly conflicting purana texts are being freely collated and edited by Brahman Sanskrit scholars for an 'authorized version' in the belief that there is a recoverable 'original'. Simi- larly in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, manifest contradictions in the text of the Bible do not lead to scepticism, at least when faith is reasonably strong, but to attempts to harmonize such passages by interpretation. How people use literacy for their own purposes and in different ways has often been demonstrated (e.g., Heath 1983; Kulick &amp; Stroud 1990). Street (1984; 1988) and Finnegan (1988; 1989; 1990) have rightly insisted that generalizations about the effects of literacy must take into account political, social and ideologi- cal factors. Literacy is not some kind of independent force acting on passive recipients. What matters is what is written and read, not that it is written and read. It is hardly conceivable that even the most voracious appetite for romantic novels or homiletic tracts would ever lead to the development of formal-operational thought in their readers. Conversely, some people who read very little of any- thing may have considerable logical expertise. This is not to conclude that literacy is irrelevant to the evolution of logical, abstract thought, but that its relevance is the result of the historical accident that Western literacy-based education happens to have been imbued with 'Aris- totelian' norms. In principle, there is no reason why an intelligent, non-literate person could not become proficient in logical thinking. Suppose some of Luria's illiterate peasants had been sent to schools that required no reading or writing, but where Aristotelian standards of reasoning were maintained and reinforced. Would they not soon learn the transpersonal, hypothetical 'all' of the basic syl- logism and go on from there to develop syllogistic skills? That literacy is not a sufficient condition for syllogistic reasoning is abundantly clear. That it may be a necessary condition has never been demonstrated, or even plausibly argued. The above thought-experiment, if it can be dignified with such a name, suggests that it is not. Historical considerations also suggest that it is not. Despite the un- doubted linkage of formal education with literacy on the one hand, and the temporal linkage of Greek alphabetic literacy with logic on the other, there seems to be no causal connexion between literacy and formal-operational thought. Is there anything left to the literacy thesis? Indeed there is, and it is something that Goody frequently affirms, namely the preservative potentiality of writing. This is not mysterious and requires no laboured psychological speculations; it has nothing to do with visual comparisons of texts, word-isolation, lists, scepticism, and so on. It simply means that, to the extent that texts are preserved, dissemi- nated, accumulated and read (an obvious but important proviso), the amount of available information can increase far beyond the carrying capacity of human memory, individual or collective; it means that each generation of thinkers can therefore build on the work of its forebears without starting all over again, thus making possible a much more rapid advancement of knowledge than is possible under oral conditions; it means that thought can be communicated more easily and accurately over space as well as time; that it can provide intellectual stimula- tion beyond the possibilities of isolated oral societies; that it can, in short, expand the mind and sharpen intelligence. These are the kinds of possibilities - only</page><page sequence="16">316 JOHN HALVERSON possibilities - opened up by writing, all of them probable and rather obvious. But they do constitute a solid and important residue of the implosion of the literacy thesis. NOTES 'The exact meaning of the word me is uncertain. 'In general, it would seem to denote a set of rules and regulations assigned to each cosmic entity and cultural phenomenon for the purpose of keeping it operating forever in accordance with the plans laid down by the deity creating it' (Kramer 1963: 115). 2 Actually the discovery of Halley's comet had little to do with records of its appearance, of which there were plenty. The trick was to distinguish one comet from many others, and this Halley accomplished by applying a Newtonian formula to determine his comet's parabolic orbit and thus its periodicity; only then could he look into the historical records for confirmation. So sophisticated a procedure was beyond any science before the seventeenth century. 3 Luria's own perspective was much broader, taking into account the profound effects of the Russian Revolution, including the collectivization programme then in process and the impact of widening political and cultural honzons. What he found in the 'peasant mentality' was not an inability to reason syllogistically, but a reluctance to accept universal premisses that lay outside personal experience or belief (Luria 1976: 114-15). The key to theoretical thinking was in the enlargement and transcendence of personal experience. REFERENCES Barnes, J. 1982. Aristotle. Oxford: Univ. Press. Biebuyck, D. &amp; K.C. Mateene 1971.

Goody et l'implosion de la theorie des effets de 1'ecriture Resume Depuls plus d'un quart de si&amp;cle, J. Goody a soutenu dans nombre de livres, conf&amp;rences et articles influents la theorie des effets de l'&amp;criture, theorie dont il est probablement l'avocat le plus fervent. Son hypothese pnncipale est l'&amp;tablhssement, aussi bien sur le plan theonque que sur le plan historique, d'une relation causale entre l'&amp;criture et le developpement de la pensee logique (c'est-a-dire le raisonnement syllogique, les operations formelles et les processus psychologiques sup&amp;rieurs). Le but de cette etude critique est de montrer qu'll n'existe aucun lien intrinseque entre l'&amp;cnture et l'esprit logique. Il est egalement demontre que le developpement potentiel de l'esprit logique, n'est pas uniquement lie aux phenomenes d'alphab&amp;tisation, mais se trouve deja au niveau du discours oral (nonliterate); et que, de plus, ces potentialites n'ont apparemmentjoue aucun r6le aux ongines historiques de la pens&amp;e logique. En d'autres termes, les assertions 'cognitives' de la theorie des effets de l'&amp;criture manquent de substance.
