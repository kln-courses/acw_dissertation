<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sinfonia anti-eroica: Berlioz's Harold en Italie and the Anxiety of Beethoven's Influence MARK EVAN BONDS I have composed a great deal for these coming con- certs; among other things there is a new symphony entitled Harold, upon which the musicians and critics are going to exercise themselves. -Hector Berlioz to Edouard Rocher, 31 July 18341 417 erlioz's prediction has come true, especially with regard to critics. Ever since its first performance in 1834, Harold en Italie has proven to be an exceptionally problematic work. Its very genre defies classification. In spite of its subtitle-Symphonie en quatre parties avec alto principal-Harold has traditionally been viewed as a work without any direct historical antecedent, as a hybrid of sym- phony and concerto that owes little or nothing to the earlier, lighter genre of the symphonie concertante. Indeed, the violist's part, as has often been noted, largely avoids the displays of virtuosity that are so characteristic of the concerto and concertante repertoires. With the exception of Harold's first movement, soloist and orchestra rarely en- gage in any kind of dialogue. For long stretches at a time, in fact, the two parties seem virtually oblivious to each other. Even the physical placement of the soloist reflects this unconventional relationship: at the beginning of the score, Berlioz calls for the violist to "stand in the foreground, near the public and isolated from the orchestra."

After a brief appearance early in the movement, the viola disappears for no fewer than 373 measures. It is silent, in other words, for more than three- fifths of the finale and for almost all of the work's final ten minutes. Its reappearance shortly before the end, moreover, is brief, tentative, and strangely anticlimactic. But of all the curious elements in this work, none has "exercised" critics more than the open evocation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the beginning of Harold's finale. The viola systematically recalls themes from each of the three previous movements, and the orches- tra, just as systematically, rejects each one. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, few commentators have failed to note the parallel here to the corresponding passage in Beethoven's Ninth, yet few have ventured to suggest why Berlioz should evoke this particular moment of this particular work so openly at precisely the corresponding point.2 Even critics well-disposed toward the work as a whole have tended to agree with J. H. Elliott that the "formal or programmatic significance" of these reminiscences in Harold is "difficult to fathom" 418 and that the review of themes from earlier movements represents little more than a "naive copy" of Beethoven's last symphony.3 The device is "delightfully self-conscious," as Hugh Macdonald has ob- served, "but it is difficult to establish any compelling psychological justification for its use, except that Beethoven's Choral Symphony was as fine a model as Berlioz knew."4 A. E. F. Dickinson considered the reminiscences and rejections a "contrived struggle."5 And on the basis of this extended passage, Tom S. Wotton went so far as to suggest that Berlioz's intensive study of Beethoven's symphonies in the late 182os and early 3os may actually have been "to some extent harmful to him."6 2 The earliest references to the allusion to Beethoven are found in "Hoplit" [i.e., Richard Pohl], "Hector Berlioz," Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik XXXIX (1853), 264; and Adolf Bernhard Marx, Die Musik des 19. Jahrhunderts und ihre Pflege (Leipzig, 1855), p. 107. 3 J. H. Elliott, Berlioz (4th edn. London, 1967), p. 148; idem, "Hector Berlioz," in The Symphony, ed.

Peter Heyworth [London, 1972], p. 178). Others who have ques- tioned the rationale and aesthetic value of these reminiscences include August Wilhelm Ambros, in his Die Grenzen der Musik und Poesie: Eine Studie zur Aesthetik der Tonkunst (Leipzig, 1855), p. 174; and Adolphe Boschot, in his Un romantique sous Louis-Philippe: Hector Berlioz, 1831-1842 (L'Histoire d'un romantique II) (Paris, 1908), p. 251.

Kern Holoman, in his recent biography of the composer (Berlioz [Cambridge, Mass., 1989],</page><page sequence="3">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE All of these problems-the mixture of genres, the unusual rela- tionship between soloist and orchestra, the disappearance of the solo- ist and the reminiscences in the finale-have traditionally been ratio- nalized by varying combinations of three related factors: Paganini's original request for a concert piece for viola and orchestra; Harold's autobiographical elements; and the "program" implicit in the work's title and four movement headings: i) Harold aux montagnes. Scenes de melancolie, de bonheur et de joie; 2) Marche de pelerins chantant la priere du soir; 3) Serenade d'un montagnard des Abruzzes a sa maitresse; and 4) the Orgie de brigands. Each of these approaches is illuminating, and each will be con- sidered in some detail later in this essay. For the moment, it is impor- tant to recognize that all three originated with the composer himself. Berlioz, the consummate composer-critic, both created the work and helped shape its critical interpretation. Yet an artist's account of his own work, valuable as it may be, can also conceal. None of these authorial interpretations adequately explains the overt allusion to Beethoven's Ninth at the beginning of Harold's finale. This particular reference is in fact so transparent as to invite-and indeed, virtually to demand-a comparison between the two works. In so doing, it 419 points to a quite different avenue of interpretation, one that Berlioz was far more reluctant to discuss in print: his deeply ambivalent atti- tude toward Beethoven's symphonies. Berlioz viewed Beethoven both as an inspiration and an obstacle, both as a model to be emulated and a precursor to be overcome. All of Berlioz's symphonies, and Harold en Italie in particular, were pro- foundly shaped by what Harold Bloom has called the "anxiety of influence," the fear a later poet experiences when he anticipates being "flooded" by a precursor's work. "Every good reader," as Bloom points out, "properly desires to drown, but if the poet drowns, he will become only a reader."7 Perhaps the most celebrated instance of this kind of anxiety in the history of music is Brahms's prolonged struggle to create a symphony while working in the shadow of Beethoven. Early in his career, Brahms may have even contemplated a symphony with choral finale.8 And as he approached the age of forty, he con- fided to the conductor Hermann Levi: "I shall never compose a p. 245), suggests no clear motivation for this reference to Beethoven's Ninth, but he does note that the "symbolism" is "decidedly non-Beethovenian" and more "Cha- teaubriandesque," points that will be pursued throughout this essay. 7 Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (New York, 1973), p. 57 (emphasis in the original). 8 See Christopher Reynolds, "A Choral Symphony by Brahms?" 19th-Century Music IX (1983), 3-25.</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY symphony! You have no idea how it feels to our kind [i.e., composers] when one always hears such a giant marching behind one."s The burden of tradition remains abundantly evident in Brahms's First Symphony, which, as Ludwig Finscher has observed, is "only to be understood when it is seen against Beethoven's Ninth and the whole Classical tradition, with which it seems at every moment to be mea- suring itself by reflection."1? The same can be said of Harold with even greater justification. Far from representing a "naive copy," this work stands out, as I shall argue, as one of the most striking of all compositional responses to Beethoven's symphonies in the nineteenth century. This is not to say that the composer's own interpretation of Harold is somehow invalid or disingenuous. Berlioz's account is in fact essen- tial to understanding the essence of his anxiety toward Beethoven's symphonies, not only because of what it includes, but also because of what it omits. According to the composer's memoirs, Harold received its impetus from Paganini, who had approached him in the early part of 1834 to write a work for viola and orchestra.ll Berlioz's original concept appears to have been for a work depicting the last moments 420 of Mary Stuart, presumably with the solo viola representing the title character. But he soon abandoned this idea for "a series of orchestral scenes in which the solo viola would be involved, to a greater or lesser extent, like an actual person, retaining the same character through- out. I wanted to make the viola a kind of melancholy dreamer in the style of Byron's Childe Harold by placing it in the milieu of poetic impressions recollected from my wanderings in the Abruzzi. Hence the title of the symphony, Harold en Italie."12 Berlioz went on to explain in some detail the recurrence of the theme associated with the character of Harold. "As in the Symphonie fantastique, a motto (the viola's first theme) recurs throughout the work [Example i], but with the difference that whereas the theme of the Symphonie fantastique, the idee fixe, keeps obtruding like an obses- sive idea on scenes that are alien to it and deflects the current of the music, the Harold theme is superimposed on the other orchestral 9 Max Kalbeck, Johannes Brahms, Vol. I (Berlin, 1921), p. 165.

Thus the unusual relationship of soloist and orchestra, according to the composer, derives from the viola's persona, Byron's Childe Harold. He is, in Berlioz's own words, a "melancholy dreamer" who "sticks to his sentimental nonsense; ev- erything else is foreign to him. He is present during the action but does not participate in it."'3 421 Berlioz also encouraged critics to view Harold as an autobiograph- ical work, in effect as another "episode in the life of an artist"-a sequel, as it were, to the combined Symphoniefantastique and Lelio. The context of Harold's wanderings is not so much Byron's Italy (re- counted in the Canto IV of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage) as Berlioz's Italy-and specifically, as the composer himself pointed out, the "poe- tic impressions" recalled from his "wanderings in the Abruzzi" in 1831-32. During his years in Rome, Berlioz saw himself, like Childe Harold, as an exile cultivating solitude and living in isolation.l4 His memoirs and letters also include repeated references to the music of the native pifferari as well as to brigands and their "orgies." At one point in his memoirs, he describes in considerable detail the gradual approach and departure of a procession of pilgrims singing litanies, a description that bears remarkable structural similarities to the large- scale form of Harold's second movement, the Marche de pelerins chan- tant la priere du soir. 5 Although Berlioz had witnessed the procession '3 Memoirs, p. 225; CG, Vol. IV, ed.

In general, however, it has been the programmatic movement headings that critics have most often used to justify the character and structure of Harold's individual movements. Unlike the earlier Sym- phonie fantastique, there is no prose program for Harold. The first movement nevertheless lends itself readily to being interpreted as a progression from "scenes of melancholy" (the extended introduction in G Minor) to "scenes of happiness and joy" (the ensuing Allegro, in G Major). The second movement, as already noted, offers a particu- larly realistic impression of a "procession of pilgrims singing the evening hymn": the gradual crescendo and decrescendo of the chorale-like melody approximate the approach and departure of just such a procession. And the heading of the third movement ("Sere- nade of an Abruzzi mountaineer") provides a comparable rationale for the movement's drone basses, jaunty rhythms, and lyrical melo- dies, as well as its prominent use of winds, especially such "pastoral" 422 instruments as the flute, oboe, and English horn. Critics have almost always justified the bizarre musical turn of events in the finale on the grounds that Harold has fled from the orgy of the brigands.'6 Once again, Berlioz himself is the initial source for such an interpretation. Fresh from a highly successful performance in Braunschweig in 1843, he described the finale as a movement in which ... wine, blood, joy, and rage mingle in mutual intoxication and make music together. The rhythm seems now to stumble, now to rush furiously forward, and the mouths of the brass seem to spew forth curses, answering prayer with blasphemy; they laugh and swill and strike, smash, kill, rape, and generally enjoy themselves. The orchestra played as though a devil possessed them. There was some- thing uncanny and awe-inspiring in their frantic exhilaration. Vio- lins, cellos, trombones, drums, cymbals, roared and leaped and sang with incredible accuracy and precision, while from the viola, the pensive Harold fleeing in dismay, a few faint echoes of his evening hymn still hovered on the vibrant air.'7 16 See, for example, Franz Liszt, "Hector Berlioz und seine 'Harold'-Symphonie," in his Gesammelte Schriften, ed. L. Ramann, Vol. IV (Leipzig, 1882), pp. 88-89 (origi- nally published serially in the Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik, 1855); Donald Francis Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, Vol. IV (London, 1937), pp. 80-82; Barzun, Berlioz, I, pp. 251-55. Some commentators have assumed that Harold dies in the end, but there is no evidence to support this. l7 Translation adapted from Memoirs, p. 311.</page><page sequence="7">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE Given the weight of the composer's authority, it is scarcely sur- prising that critical commentary on Harold has relied almost exclu- sively on Berlioz's own interpretations. And in light of the importance of the prose program associated with the earlier Symphonie fantastique, it is also understandable that critics have placed special emphasis on the programmatic movement headings in Harold. As early as 1855, Liszt used Harold (not the Symphonie fantastique) as the springboard for an extended essay on program music, asserting that all of the work's "exclusively musical considerations, while by no means disregarded, are subordinate to the handling of the given subject."'8 Although few critics today would be willing to adopt such an extreme position, it would be equally mistaken to insist that a work like Harold be judged entirely apart from its title and movement-headings. These so-called "extra-musical" elements are just as much a part of the score as the notes themselves, and it would be fundamentally wrong to ignore them in analyzing this work. At the same time, the nature of the "program" is by no means straightforward. The connections between Berlioz's music and By- ron's verse are remarkably tenuous.9l Beyond the basic nature of the central character and the general idea of a pilgrimage, it is impossible 423 to identify specific parallels with Byron's poem. As far as the finale is concerned, Berlioz did not have to end his symphony with a band of brigands: the very idea of an orgy, although Byronic enough in its own right, is not to be found in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. In any event, the systematic review and rejection of themes from earlier movements at the beginning of the finale remains to be ex- plained, regardless of whether one interprets Harold as a program- matic or an autobiographical work. And if any one passage within the score stands in need of explanation, it is surely this one. This allusion to Beethoven's Ninth, as noted before, demands a comparison between the two works. It demands, in other words, that Harold be considered in the context of its historical position within the genre of the symphony. The indication of genre, as Carl Dahlhaus has pointed out, is at least in part an indication of the tradition within which a work asks to be judged.20 And it was not merely for lack of a ,8 Liszt, "Hector Berlioz," p. 69.

See also Schumann's observation early in his celebrated review of the Symphonie fantastique: "We are wont to judge objects by the names they bear; we make certain demands of a 'fantasy,' others of a 'sonata' "-and others still, as Schumann went on to argue, of a symphony.

Berlioz," in his Gesammelte Schriften uber Musik und Musiker, 5th edn., ed.</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY better term that Berlioz explicitly subtitled Harold a "symphony in four movements with solo viola." He referred to the work as his "second symphony" on at least one occasion and as a "symphony" on many others.21 If we accept the composer's generic designation of Harold as something more than a linguistic faute de mieux and view the work within the historical context of its self-proclaimed genre, the inner workings of the piece, particularly the finale, can be interpreted from a new perspective. The character and structure of the individual movements, the curious nature of the soloist's role, and the very choice of Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage as the programmatic basis for the work can all be better understood when we consider Harold's position within the tradition of the symphony-and specifically, within the tradition of the symphony after Beethoven. The very idea of writing a symphony that reflects the fate of a central protagonist is clearly indebted to the "Eroica," and there are numerous other allu- sions in Harold to the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Symphonies as well. Given these references, Harold can in fact be interpreted as Berlioz's most concentrated response to Beethoven's symphonic legacy. The nature of this response, however, is deeply ambivalent. In 424 spite of the unmistakable reference to the Ninth, Harold does not end with a rousing set of variations, a triumphant march, or a chorale-like theme of triumph. Instead, the "hero" of this work is vanquished. Byron's Harold is the essence of the Romantic hero: far from Napo- leonic, he is withdrawn, contemplative, and isolated from society, a prototypical anti-hero. Harold en Italie is, in effect, Berlioz's Sinfonia anti-eroica. In the first of the remaining four sections of this essay, I shall attempt to reconcile the allusion to Beethoven's Ninth with Harold's "program" and, to a lesser extent, with its autobiographical elements. In the second and third sections, I shall consider the motivations behind Berlioz's choice of an anti-hero as a symphonic protagonist, with particular emphasis on the composer's ambivalent attitude to- ward Beethoven. In the final section, I shall consider briefly the impli- cations of these arguments for Berlioz's other three symphonies and our view of Berlioz as a symphonist. Berlioz's struggle with his pre- cursor, as we shall see, extended throughout his entire career as a symphonist, from the Symphonie fantastique (1830) to the revised (1842) version of the Symphonie funebre et triomphale.

Kern Holoman, Catalogue of the Works of Hector Berlioz (Kassel, 1987), pp. 141-44.</page><page sequence="9">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE I. Beethoven's Ninth and Harold's Program Functionally, a series of reminiscences coupled with rejections cannot stand on its own: it demands resolution. The successive negation of earlier ideas at the opening of Harold's finale emphasizes the inadequacy of previous themes to provide the sense of conclusion one expects in a nineteenth-century symphonic finale. Placed at the very beginning of a finale, this series of paired reminis- cences and negations implies that these earlier, inadequate ideas will at some point be supplanted by one that will prove impervious to the forces of negation. Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" theme fulfills precisely this role in the Ninth Symphony, providing the affirmation that tran- scends the negations heard at the beginning of the movement. The structural parallel in the Orgie de brigands establishes a corresponding expectation that a theme of resolution and triumph will appear before the end of Harold as well. Unlike the dissonance that opens the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, the dissonance at the beginning of the Orgie de brigands is timbral and rhythmic rather than harmonic, but it is no less jarring to the listener. 425 After the close of the third-movement serenade on a serene C-major triad marked PP, a fortissimo D-major7-chord erupts without warn- ing from virtually the entire orchestra, which includes three trom- bones, two cornets, two trumpets, timpani, cymbals, and tambourine. The rhythms of this Allegro frenetico make the downbeat alternately distinct and indistinct, but always propulsive (Example 2).22 This, surely, is music suitable for an orgy of brigands. In reviewing themes from earlier movements, Berlioz begins, like Beethoven, by returning to the very opening of the symphony (Ex- ample 3). This idea, however, is rejected by the forceful return of the brigands' music (m. 18); but this rejection, in turn, is itself soon in- terrupted by a quotation of the main theme from the second move- ment, the Marche de pelerins (m. 34, Example 4). The brigands' music negates this idea, too (m. 41), only to give way to the mountaineer's serenade from the third movement (m. 46, Example 5). By now, we fully expect that this theme will also be rejected, which indeed it is, quite abruptly, in m. 54. Up until m. 54, the sequence of reminiscences and rejections is precisely the same as that found in Beethoven's Ninth: Berlioz recalls each of his symphony's three earlier movements in the order of their original appearance. Following the paradigm of the Ninth, one would 22 See Carl Dahlhaus, "Allegro frenetico.

Instead, the review of earlier material continues, returning to a dif- ferent starting point within the opening movement, the beginning of the Allegro (m. 131 of the first movement, m. 60 of the finale, Ex- ample 6).

To varying degrees, Beethoven's quotations of preceding themes are also less than literal.</page><page sequence="13">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE the very end of the work. The brigands' music continues uninter- rupted for another 363 measures. Yet when Harold returns at this late point (m. 473), he appears neither with his own theme nor with a new theme of transcendence; instead, he re-enters within yet ano- ther reprise of the Marche de pelerins. He returns, moreover, not as a lone soloist, but in the company of three off-stage solo strings-two violins and a cello (Example 8). He returns under the cover, so to speak, of a string quartet, a medium in which the viola is traditionally an inner voice rather than a predominant one.24 When Harold finally does work up enough courage to put forward a very small gesture from his own theme, he is soon overwhelmed (m. 505): once again, he is powerless to withstand the onslaught of the brigands. By the time the work ends, the one theme most likely to have provided a resolu- tion for the entire symphony has barely put in an appearance within the last movement. The "Harold" theme is not stated openly in its entirety even once in the finale. The most immediate purpose of the reference to Beethoven's Ninth in Harold, then, is to emphasize the differences between the two works. Like Beethoven, Berlioz precipitates an atmosphere of crisis by invoking themes from all three previous movements, only to declare 429 each of these ideas inadequate. But there the similarities end. No soloist intervenes in the crisis ("O Freunde, nicht diese Tone!"); in- deed, the soloist who had been present throughout disappears, and Berlioz offers no substitute in place of the rejected themes. Instead, the music of rejection, the brigands' music, itself becomes the center- piece of the finale. By evoking the paradigm of the Ninth, Berlioz underlines the manner in which his own finale, with its subsequent non-resolution of crisis, differs from Beethoven's. This open reference to Beethoven's Ninth has a broader function as well. It signals unmistakably that Harold will fall into the category of the end-accented symphonic "plot archetype," epitomized by Bee- thoven's Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, in which the finale is the spiri- tual culmination of the entire work.25 Implicit in the process of review and rejection is the authority to summarize and pass judgment on all 24 Almost two decades after composing Harold and four years after its first pub- lication, Berlioz apparently changed his mind about the instrumentation of this off- stage ensemble. In a letter to Liszt of 7 June 1852 (CG IV, 166-67), he recommends doubling the two violins and the cello with two oboes and a bassoon. While these doublings make the distant ensemble more audible, they do not alter the basic texture of the string quartet. 25 On the concept of symphonic plot archetypes in the nineteenth century, see Anthony Newcomb, "Once More 'Between Absolute and Program Music': Schumann's Second Symphony," 19th-Century Music VII (1984), 233-50.

(The finale of Beethoven's Fifth, significantly, also incorporates a substantial and near-literal reference to an earlier movement, as well as more subtle allusions to other movements.) Harold's "plot" is also end-accented, but in a manner quite differ- ent from the paradigms of Beethoven's Fifth and Ninth Symphonies -or for that matter, of any number of subsequent symphonies by nineteenth-century composers whose finales incorporate references to ideas from previous movements. These include Brahms's First Symphony (1876), Bruckner's Fifth (1878, featuring a systematic review of ideas from earlier movements at the beginning of the fi- nale), Mahler's First (1888), and Franck's Symphony in D Minor (1888). In each of these works, the finale reaches an emotional turn- ing point with what can be characterized as a chorale-like theme of triumph. Only in the case of Berlioz is the review left unanswered, the crisis unresolved. The only "chorale" in the finale of Harold is the pilgrims' canto, which in fact returns twice within the finale, including the reminiscence near the very end of the work (m. 473). On the basis of the work's "program," Harold has joined the religious pilgrims and concealed himself in their midst; but on the basis of the work's genre, 434 Berlioz is again contradicting Beethoven's Ninth. The "chorale" in Harold provides no salvation at all. Whereas the idea of joy pervades Beethoven's finale, at least once the voices enter, it is explicitly present only in Harold's opening movement ("Scenes de melancolie, de bonheur et de joie"). Emotionally, Harold presents almost a mirror image of the Ninth, which begins with struggle and culminates in joy. The earliest direct compositional response to the Ninth Symphony is thus in many respects the least conventional, the one that runs most directly counter to its precursor. As such, it is also the closest actual equivalent to Adrian Leverkiihn's fictional "revocation" of the Ninth Symphony in Thomas Mann's novel Doktor Faustus (1947). Leverkiihn's last work, Dr. Fausti Weheklag, is a "taking back," a "negation" of Beethoven's last symphony, not only in its central theme of lamentation, but also in its emotional trajectory. This "symphonic cantata" is an essentially static work that ends with a purely orchestral Adagio: the choral forces that had been so prominent throughout the work withdraw in the finale.26 The failure of the "Harold" theme to assert itself as an agent of transcendence in the Orgie de brigands is all the more remarkable when we consider just how well its return in the finale has been prepared in earlier movements. The implicit reference within the work's title to Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage leads us to expect that the work will address the experiences of a particular pilgrim, and that this pilgrim, 26 Thomas Mann, Doktor Faustus (Stockholm, 1947), Chapters 45-46.</page><page sequence="19">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE represented by the solo viola, will undergo some sort of change over the course of his travels. The series of programmatic movement head- ings in Berlioz's symphony reinforces this expectation. The first movement introduces Harold alone, in the mountains, while subse- quent movements present him in a series of diverse encounters, albeit from afar: first with a group of more conventional pilgrims; then with an Abruzzi mountaineer and his beloved; and finally with the brig- ands. In the simplest terms, Harold progresses from solitude, in the opening Allegro, to at least a limited degree of contact with others in the subsequent three movements. The two middle movements, as noted earlier, present the protag- onist in a decidedly detached role vis-a-vis the orchestra: Harold's theme, as the composer himself pointed out, tends to be superim- posed on the music of others. He observes but does not participate in the pilgrim's procession and in the mountaineer's serenade. But there is much more to the viola's part in these two inner movements than the "Harold" theme alone. In both the Marche de pelerins and the Sere'nade d'un montagnard, in fact, we can sense Harold's symbolic at- tempt to integrate himself into society. The relationship between solo- ist and orchestra changes subtly but significantly over the course of 435 these two inner movements. Let us examine each of them in turn. The two most obvious structural elements of the Marche de pelerins are the quasi-ostinato pattern of the pilgrims' canto, built out of units of eight (sometimes eight-plus-two) measures, and the large-scale cre- scendo and decrescendo representing the approach and departure (from Harold's vantage point) of the pilgrims (see Figure i). After a brief introduction, the canto of the religious pilgrims begins at m. 16 with the treading rhythm of the procession. When Harold, the secular pilgrim, enters at m. 60, it is with a decidedly jaunty, un-pilgrim-like figure which in its syncopations seems almost to mock the off-beats of the processional music (Example 9). It is at m. 64, at last, that the "Harold" theme is superimposed on the pilgrims' hymn. The two ideas begin together but proceed their separate ways, more or less oblivious to one another. Although both parts are notated in 2, the solo viola preserves the original triple meter of his theme from the first movement, playing here, in effect, in 2. The two themes remain out of step with one another for a considerable time. The viola's cadence at m. 75, marking the end of the first phrase of the "Harold" theme, for example, falls in the middle of an eight-measure unit of the canto. (In the ballroom scene of Romeo et Juliette, Berlioz would later use this same technique of thematic superimposition to convey the idea of an individual's solitude even while in the middle of a crowd.)</page><page sequence="20">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY EXAMPLE 9.

As the pilgrims draw nearer, the music increases to its dynamic climax, meticulously indicated in the score at m. 131. Harold has presumably been hiding during this time. But he has also been listening. When he returns after the procession has passed (m. 144), he does not resume his own theme; instead, he adds a triplet descant that, in marked contrast to his self-absorption in the opening section, is very much in step with the pilgrims' canto (Example io).

In its almost etude-like character, it may represent an oblique allusion to Paganini; more likely still, it symbolizes the kind of abnegation and self-discipline that are at the center of the religious pilgrim's outlook. Throughout this middle section, the viola continues to eschew the "Harold" theme, and his arpeggiated counterpoint remains rhythmi- cally synchronized with the pilgrims' music. Even when the original canto resumes in m. 248, the viola's arpeggios continue, punctuating in rhythmic synchronization the opening and closing portions of each phrase of the hymn (mm. 258 and 265; 268 and 275). This penultimate section of the movement (mm. 248-77) falls short of constituting a true dialogue between soloist and orchestra, but at the very least, Harold is no longer oblivious to the pilgrims. The eerie- one might well say ecstatic, other-worldly-sounds of the modally- inflected canto religioso persist as a kind of spiritual reverberation within him. Harold still does not revert to his original theme, and his adherence to this arpeggiated figure through the very end of the movement suggests that even though he has not taken up the pil- grims' hymn, neither has it left him completely unmoved. One senses in all of this that Harold, the solitary pilgrim, has been touched, even if he has not been converted.</page><page sequence="23">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE FIGURE 1.

But in the final section of this movement (mm. 166ff.), for the first time in the entire work, Harold takes on an idea explicitly associated with some- one other than himself. He emphasizes, as it turns out, those elements of the mountaineer's serenade that correspond most closely to his own theme (Example 11). This is an important moment nevertheless, for it provides the strongest evidence yet that Harold, in spite of his essentially solitary nature, is in fact attempting to assimilate the world beyond himself. However incapable he may be of realizing that goal, we are reminded that the protagonist of this work is in truth a pilgrim, a seeker. By the opening of the finale, then, we have come to expect that the "Harold" theme will figure prominently in every movement, and that the character of Harold, as exemplified by his theme, will con- tinue to show signs of change and development. The feeble attempts at a reprise of the "Harold" theme within the finale (mm. 8off. and mm. 493ff.) thus run counter to expectations that have been estab- lished over the larger course of the work. These expectations are reinforced all the more strongly through the open reference to Beethoven's Ninth at the beginning of the finale. In the end, however, it is the absence of fundamental change within Harold that is so surprising. 439</page><page sequence="24">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY EXAMPLE 11.

Allegretto . in^ o iDly~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~dim. poco a poco r r fr A - 1 r r lr ^ X l dim. poco a poco When viewed from this perspective, the extended and much- maligned literal repetition within the last movement (mm. 280-410 = mm. 118-247; see Figure 2) can be understood as something more 440 than mere empty padding. Jacques Barzun is certainly correct to point out that this large-scale repeat allows us to appreciate details that might otherwise have remained unnoticed at only a single hear- ing; this is, after all, an extraordinarily rich score. But the same might be said of almost any repetition in almost any work. The purpose of this particular repeat goes beyond the issue of intelligibility. Given the allusion to Beethoven's Ninth and the concomitant strategy to thwart the arrival of any transcendent theme, the middle portion of the finale must fulfill two demands: it must counterbalance the weight and size of the introduction, with the reminiscences; and it must extend the length of time during which the soloist is consigned to the role of a non-participant. While Berlioz could have expanded the finale at this point through any number of means, the solution he chose was a literal repetition of the exposition, followed by a relatively brief development section. Had he presented either an extended new development or even a varied reprise of the exposition, the focus of our attention within this movement would necessarily have been drawn toward the evolution of ideas associated with the brigands' orgy. But the primary function of this part of the movement is less to develop ideas than to delay the anticipated return of the viola. In spite of its prominence, the brigands' music is not the main event of the finale; Harold's failure to reassert himself is. The structure of the finale as a whole, following this interpreta- tion, can be represented schematically as in Figure 2.</page><page sequence="25">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE FIGURE 2.

But there are sufficient struc- tural parallels with the conventions of sonata form to make the repeat of the exposition and the moment of recapitulation perceptible as such. And if one recognizes the shift from B6 Major to Bb Minor at m. 200 as a less significant event than the earlier modulation to an altogether different key (G Minor to Bb Major), then mm. 248-279 emerge as an extended interlude or retransition to the exposition's opening. Danuser's schema, moreover, disregards the important change of mood in mm. 248-279, in which the frenzy of the orgy gives way, for the first time since Harold's disappearance, to a more hesitant, introspective passage-gives way, in other words, to music more characteristic of Harold than of the brigands. In its own fashion, 27 Hermann Danuser, "Symphonisches Subjekt und Form in Berlioz' Harold en Italie," Melos/NZ III (1977), 211.</page><page sequence="26">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY this brief interlude offers yet one more juncture at which the possi- bility of Harold's return is intimated, only to be averted. It is a mo- ment of wavering: neither the viola nor the "Harold" theme return, but the orgy abates temporarily, as if to prepare the listener for a decisive change in the course of the movement. The "change," when it does come, arrives in the form of an exact repetition of the expo- sition. By providing such a clear contrast to the brigands' music, the interlude/retransition in mm. 248-279 makes the literal return of the exposition in m. 280 all the more surprising. This large-scale repetition of the exposition also allows for a rel- atively brief development section, whose principal function, like that of the brigands' music in general, is to prolong the violist's absence. The feebleness of the soloist's final return in mm. 483ff. is made even more remarkable by the very fact that the work concludes so soon thereafter. The finale, in any event, leaves us with a strange sense of non- resolution, for Berlioz's treatment of his central character violates another plot archetype, in which an important character in a story disappears for a prolonged period, only to make a dramatic return 442 just before the end. In this respect, Berlioz anticipates Evelyn Waugh's much later literary cultivation of the technique by which a figure who has played a central role for the better part of a novel wanders off to some distant corner of the world and never reappears (Tony in A Handful of Dust, Sebastian in Brideshead Revisited). It cannot be said that these characters disappear from the plot, for the first-time reader will almost inevitably anticipate their return and expect it to play a major role in the resolution of the story. In Waugh's novels, as in Harold, the character's failure to return violates yet another, even more basic premise of plot: that the fate of a work's most important characters will somehow be resolved in the end. A number of nineteenth-century critics were repelled by the moral tone of Harold's last movement, with its triumph of evil over good, just as they had been offended by the Songe d'une nuit du sabbat of the Symphonie fantastique.28 But the real problem of the finale in Harold lies not so much in its implicit program as in the manner in which the work runs counter to the paradigm explicitly evoked at its opening. The central event of Harold's finale-and thus by extension of the work as a whole-is an event that does not happen. The most shocking fact about this last movement is not that Harold begins the 28 Hermann Kretzschmar deplored the "tastelessness" of Harold's program in general (Fiihrer durch den Concertsaal [3rd edn. Leipzig, 1898], Abtheilung I, p. 268); see also Ambros, Die Grenzen der Musik und Poesie, p. 174; and Karl Grunsky, Musikgeschichte des 19. Jahrhunderts (Leipzig, 1902), I, p. 95.</page><page sequence="27">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE orgy as an outsider, as a nonparticipating witness: this, after all, is true to his character as established in previous movements. What is most unsettling about the finale is the fact that Harold remains the pro- verbial wallflower at the orgy right through to the very end. Harold is, in effect, a pilgrimage wherein the central character experiences nei- ther salvation nor defeat, a musical Bildungsroman in which the pro- tagonist ultimately learns nothing. Yet if Harold's finale fails to resolve the basic issues of its previous movements in a traditional manner, it does not follow that the struc- ture of the work as a whole is episodic, a "series of scenes" rather than a "closed drama."29 The non-return of the "Harold" theme within the finale has in fact been adumbrated throughout the work. The theme, as noted before, does not return after the central canto religioso of the second movement, and while hinted at by the viola near the end of the serenade, it does not come back in its original guise there, either. In its own way, the finale presents an internally consistent, if untradi- tional, conclusion for the characters and events presented in the pre- vious three movements. The difference is that Harold himself is an unconventional protagonist. 443 II. Heroes, Anti-Heroes, and Symphonies The idea of writing a "heroic" symphony-a work associated with a single protagonist, be he real or imagined-is, as noted before, directly indebted to Beethoven's "Eroica" ("composta per festiggiare il sovvenire di un grand Uomo"). But throughout the nineteenth century, the Ninth was also considered a "heroic" sym- phony. In an essay of 1838, Christian Urhan, the soloist for the pre- miere of Harold, called it Beethoven's "moral [auto]biography."30 Wagner, in turn, described the Ninth as the "titanic struggle of a 29 Wolfgang D6mling, Hector Berlioz und seine Zeit (Laaber, 1986), p. lo ; see also Elliott, Berlioz, p. 149. Berlioz's own comment about composing a "series of scenes," quoted above, refers to an early compositional stage of the piece, before he conceived of it as a work in four movements and possibly before he considered calling it a symphony. 30 Urhan, review in Le Temps, 25 January 1838, quoted in David Benjamin Levy, Early Performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony: A Comparative Study of Five Major Cities (Ph.D. diss., Eastman School of Music, 1979), p. 330. Urhan, whose native language was German and who maintained close ties with his parents, near Aachen, may have been following the lead of Joseph Fr6hlich, who ten years earlier (Cicilia VIII [1828]) had called the Ninth the "musikalisch-geschriebene Autobiographie Beethovens"; see Stefan Kunze, ed., Ludwig van Beethoven: Die Werke im Spiegel seiner Zeit (Laaber, 1987), p. 513.</page><page sequence="28">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY heroic soul."31 Stylistically, too, Beethoven's last symphony has been seen as marking a return to the "heroic" style of the composer's so- called "middle" period.32 Berlioz himself frequently interpreted Beethoven's symphonies with anthropomorphic imagery. He was well aware of the Napoleonic associations of the "Eroica" and saw the entire work (not only the slow movement) as a "funeral oration for a hero."33 He considered the first movement of the Fifth to be "devoted to the depiction of disordered feelings that overwhelm a great soul prey to despair," and he likened the finale, in turn, to a "gigantic song of victory, in which the soul of the poet-musician, at last liberated from earthly shackles and suf- ferings, seems to soar radiantly toward the heavens."34 In the Ninth, Berlioz saw the opening text of the last movement as the voice of Beethoven himself, speaking through a "coryphaeus," and he de- scribed the subsequent Allegro assai vivace alla marcia (mm. 331ff., the "Turkish" section) as the "departing song of a hero certain of victory."35 Essential to the "heroic" quality in much of Beethoven's music is the sense of struggle. The image of per aspera ad astra has been a 444 central theme in the reception of Beethoven's works since the com- poser's own day.36 The heroic element lies not in victory, but in the process of struggle; even a work like the Coriolan Overture, which ends piano and in the minor mode, follows a pattern of conflict and resolution. Against the historical understanding of Beethoven's symphonies as "heroic" works, Berlioz's choice of Byron's Harold as a symphonic protagonist represents a striking contrast. The Harold of both Berlioz and Byron is a passive outsider, contemplative and withdrawn from the world even as he traverses it. While close structural parallels be- tween Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and Harold en Italie are lacking, Ber- lioz does remain faithful to the essence of Harold's character as an isolated, self-absorbed pilgrim in exile. This isolation is due in large part to Harold's recognition of himself as an outcast from society: 3' Wagner, "Beethoven's Choral Symphony at Dresden, 1846: Programme," in Richard Wagner's Prose Works, trans.

(III, 12)37 There are, to be sure, autobiographical motivations for Berlioz's choice of Harold as his hero. It is difficult to imagine the composer reading these lines during his years in Italy and not thinking of his battles with the Paris Conservatoire, the bureaucracy of the Opera, and the Parisian public in general. Convinced of his own talents but per- petually thwarted, Berlioz was especially susceptible to the "disease of isolation" and its associated symptom, melancholy, during his own "exile" in Italy.38 After winning the Prix de Rome on his third attempt, in 1830, he had been obligated, in spite of his protests, to take up residence at the French Academy in Rome. When he left Paris in early 445 1831, he was removing himself not only from Harriet Smithson, but also from his first opportunity to hear a concert performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on 27 March. Writing from Italy, he cursed "five hundred thousand times" his "imprisonment" in a "dis- mal and antimusical" country at a time when Beethoven's last sym- phony was being performed for the first time in Paris.39 The motiva- tion for juxtaposing Beethoven's Ninth with the images of exile and isolation in Harold is thus at least in part autobiographical. But the choice of Byron's Harold transcends Berlioz's own per- sonal circumstances. Harold is, in essence, the very image of the artist in French Romanticism, privileged but isolated. His insights are both a blessing and a curse: within the world of ideas and emotions, his heightened sensitivity sets him above the populace, but this same sensitivity renders him a social outcast. He is as hostile to society as it is to him.4o In his writings, Berlioz speaks at length about the elevated but solitary position of the artist in society, and he specifically cites 37 All quotations from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are taken from Byron, The Com- plete Poetical Works, Vol. II, ed.

The artist's rejection of and by society is counterbalanced by his ability to find comfort and inspiration in nature. Solitude in nature is no solitude at all: this, too, is a theme that appears in both Berlioz's writings and throughout Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell, To slowly trace the forest's shady scene, Where things that own not man's dominion dwell, And mortal foot hath ne'er, or rarely been; To climb the trackless mountain all unseen, With the wild flock that never needs a fold; Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean; This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unroll'd. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~446 (1~(II, 25) 446 I live not in myself, but I become Portion of that around me; and to me, High mountains are a feeling, but the hum Of human cities torture ....

(I, 84) At least some of Byron's English contemporaries found Harold "unknightly" ("Childe" being a designation for a young nobleman) because lacking, in Byron's own lightly ironical words, in "love, hon- our, and so forth." Byron rejected the label of "unknightly" yet did not dispute the unconventional nature of his protagonist.42 The French, on the other hand, did not find Harold nearly so unconventional, for the image of the introverted, melancholy hero was already well established on the continent. In the late eighteenth century, Goethe's Die Leiden des jungen Werther (1774) had been as popular in France as it had been in Germany.43 Rousseau's Reveries du promeneur solitaire (published posthumously in 1782) had provided a prototype for the isolated, self-absorbed "Romantic hero" that ap- 447 pears in a long string of eponymous novels of the early nineteenth century, most notably Chateaubriand's Rene, (1802), Etienne de Senancour's Obermann (1804), and Henri Constant's Adolphe (1807, first published 1816). Later examples of this same kind of introspec- tive, melancholy hero appeared in Alfred de Vigny's Stello (1832), George Sand's Lelia (1833), and Alfred de Musset's Confession d'un enfant du siecle (1836).44 Berlioz had in fact already compared the emotional state of the artist-hero of his Symphonie fantastique to that of Chateaubriand's Rene.45 42 See Byron's "Addition" to the preface of Cantos I and II of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, ed. McGann, p. 5. 43 See Virgile Rossel, Histoire des relations litteraires entre la France et l'Allemagne (Paris, 1897), pp. 95-103. 44 In Chapter Four of his Hector Berlioz und seine Zeit, Domling discusses Berlioz and the image of the "lonely hero" at length.

He is too isolated and absorbed in egocentric self-assertion to fight for any abstract ideal, and while he fulfills the traditional role as a story's chief protagonist, his dominance derives not from what he does, but from what he thinks-mostly about himself. He remains uncommitted to the traditional hero's cause outside himself: there is no deed, no sac- rifice, no true discovery.46 The Romantic hero's self-absorption, in turn, only reinforces his separation from society. He is, as Raymond Giraud observes, "too bourgeois to be heroic, too lonely and sensitive to be bourgeois."47 Childe Harold is very much a part of this tradition, particularly in France, where Byron's vogue was at its peak during the 182os and 30s.48 Like his French counterparts Rene, Adolphe, and others, Childe Harold is a singularly passive figure whose introspection traps him in debilitating self-analysis. He rejects society but makes no at- tempt to reform it. Instead, he withdraws to the mountains and ob- serves society with an acute sense of detachment. Berlioz's Harold is the musical manifestation of this antithetical hero. The very choice of 448 the viola as a solo instrument reinforces the sense of the protagonist's isolation from society. Although the impetus for writing a concert work for viola originated with Paganini, the decision to use this par- ticular instrument as the image of Byron's "melancholy dreamer" rests at least in part on the viola's status as the quintessential "out- sider" of the orchestra. It is not an exotic instrument, but it seldom plays a prominent role; Beethoven's symphonies contain scarcely a single exposed passage for the violas. Within the family of stringed instruments, it lacks the projective power of the violin or the cello, and within the conventions of four-part string writing, it is the one voice least likely to play a leading role. The image of the outsider appears to have been a basic element of this work even before it came to be associated with Byron's epic poem: Mary Stuart, Berlioz's original persona for the viola, was also a figure who, in her last moments, was isolated from society. The contrast between the passive Harold and the struggling (and more abstract) hero of Beethoven's symphonies could not be more striking. The idea of a Beethoven symphony ending with the flight of its protagonist is utterly foreign to Beethoven's concept of the 46 Furst, "The Romantic Hero," p. 43. 47 Raymond Giraud, The Unheroic Hero in the Novels of Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert (New Brunswick, N.J., 1957), p. 185. 48 On the reception of Byron's works in France, see Edmond Esteve, Byron et le romantisme franfais: Essai sur la fortune et l'influence de l'oeuvre de Byron en France de 1812 a 1850 (Paris, 1907).</page><page sequence="33">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE symphony-or to his concept of music in general, for that matter. The ideals of the Ninth, in particular, are so lofty that it has come to represent, in Maynard Solomon's words, "an unsurpassable model of affirmative culture, a culture which by its beauty and idealism, some believe, anaesthetizes the anguish and the terror of modern life, thereby standing in the way of a realistic perception of society."49 Berlioz's Harold is an antidote to this idealism. The hero is the artist, but the artist is not a hero in the traditional sense: his relationship to society is far more ambivalent. The finale of the Ninth Symphony celebrates a utopian ideal of brotherhood and the reconciliation of the individual with society. Harold, on the other hand, presents a world in which the individual-and specifically the artist-will always be an outsider. To Childe Harold, "Seid umschlungen, Millionen" would be an utterly repellant imperative. He follows, instead, the injunction to "creep tearfully away" from the circle of joy, for Harold is one of those unfortunate individuals who "cannot name as their own a single other soul on earth": Wem der grosse Wurf gelungen, Eines Freundes Freund zu sein, 449 Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, Mische seinen Jubel ein! Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle weinend sich aus diesem Bund. On the basis of its soloist's limited role, Harold has been called an "anti-concerto,"5? but on the basis of its self-proclaimed genre and protagonist, it is more illuminating to consider Harold an anti-hero and Harold an anti-symphony-and more specifically, as Berlioz's Sin- fonia anti-eroica. III. Berlioz and the "Terrifying Giant" Why, then, should Berlioz have written such an anti-heroic symphony? Much of the answer lies in his deeply ambiv- alent attitude toward Beethoven. As a critic, Berlioz openly admired and championed Beethoven's works, especially the symphonies;51 as a 49 Solomon, Beethoven, p. 315. 50 Wolfgang Domling, liner notes to Harold en Italie, Wolfram Christ, viola; Ber- liner Philharmoniker/Lorin Maazel (Deutsche Grammophon 415 109-4, 1985). 51 See Berlioz, "Etude critique des symphonies de Beethoven," ATC, pp. 35-79; Leo Schrade, Beethoven in France (New Haven, 1942); Barzun, Berlioz, I, pp. 88-89; Wolfgang D6mling, "Die Symphonie als Drama: Bemerkungen zu Berlioz' Beethoven- Verstandnis," in Festschrift Georg von Dadelsen zum 60. Geburtstag, ed. Thomas Kohlhase</page><page sequence="34">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY composer, Berlioz saw him as both an inspiration and an obstacle, a precursor to be both emulated and overcome. Berlioz had come to know Beethoven's symphonies in the late 182os, aided in large part by Habeneck's performances of these works at the Conservatoire. In January of 1829, shortly after one such per- formance, he confided to Edouard Rocher: "Now that I have heard that terrifying giant Beethoven, I know exactly where musical art stands; the issue now is to take it from there and push it farther ... not further, that is impossible-he has reached the limits of the art- but as far along another route. There is much to be done that is new; I sense this with an extreme energy. And I will do it, you can be sure, if I live."52 The phrase "terrifying giant" ("effrayant geant") is of course an acknowledgement of Beethoven's greatness; but this char- acterization also reflects a certain recognition of the danger of being overwhelmed. Berlioz's self-proclaimed goal was to extend Beethov- en's idea of music (particularly the symphony) along a "different route." Harold en Italie is at once both an act of homage and an attempt to confront the anxiety of being "flooded" by a powerful precursor.53 "When a poet experiences incarnation qua poet," Bloom argues, 450 "he experiences anxiety necessarily towards any danger that might end him as a poet."54 Beethoven, in Berlioz's view, was just such a force. He had defined the boundaries of the symphony and could not be ignored; yet neither could he be imitated. To emulate Beethoven in the mid-nineteenth century, as Carl Dahlhaus has pointed out, was not so much to imitate his works as to transcend them. Mere imitation had "lost its aesthetic legitimacy in the symphony. To prove himself a worthy heir of Beethoven, a composer of a symphony had to avoid copying Beethoven's style, and yet maintain the same degree of re- flection that Beethoven had reached in grappling with the problem of symphonic form."55 and Volker Scherliess (Neuhausen-Stuttgart, 1978), pp. 59-72; and Katherine Kolb Reeve, The Poetics of the Orchestra in the Writings of Hector Berlioz (Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1978). 52 CG I, 229, letter of 1 1 January 1829: "A present quej'ai entendu cet effrayant geant Beethoven, je sais a quel en est l'art musical, il s'agit de le prendre a ce point-la et de le pousser plus loin ... pas plus loin, c'est impossible, il a atteint les bornes de l'art, mais aussi loin dans une autre route. II y a du neuf a faire et beaucoup, je le sens avec une energie extreme; etj'en ferai, sois-en sur, sije vis." The ellipses are Berlioz's own.

On the broadest scale, Harold is the only one of Berlioz's four symphonies that falls into the stan- dard format of four movements. The opening Allegro begins with a slow introduction; the second-movement Larghetto is lyrical in char- acter; and the third-movement Allegro assai clearly alternates be- tween scherzo- and trio-like sections. Even the Orgie de brigands fea- tures many of the qualities traditionally associated with a symphonic finale: a fast tempo, rhythmic drive, and a fullness of sound. More specifically, the Marche de pelerins takes as its model the slow movement of Beethoven's Seventh: both are marked Allegretto and begin with brief introductions in which the winds predominate; both are based on a quasi-ostinato rhythm of eight-measure units consist- ing of quarter- and eighth-notes; both make ample use of what might be called structural dynamics, with large-scale crescendos and decre- scendos; and both movements feature a contrasting middle section and a fragmentation of the opening theme at the very end.56 (It is remarkable, too, how Berlioz seems to have conceived of the Marche 451 de pelerins almost from the start as a detachable movement that would find favor with a wider public-fulfilling, that is, much the same role as the Allegretto of Beethoven's Seventh, which was one of the com- poser's single most popular movements in the mid-nineteenth century and was often performed separately.)57 Donald Francis Tovey found the resemblance of the "Harold" theme to the principal idea of the Seventh Symphony's first move- ment to be a "very curious and by no means superficial fact."58 By itself, the resemblance seems less than convincing, particularly when one recalls that Berlioz had originally used the "Harold" theme in the rejected Intrata di Rob-Roy MacGregor (1833).59 When considered in conjunction with the overt parallels between Harold's second 56 Some of these similarities are discussed in Mosco Carner, "A Beethoven Move- ment and its Successors," Music &amp; Letters XX (1939), 287-89. The Allegretto of Beethoven's Seventh, as Carner argues, also provided a model for the slow movements of Schubert's "Great" C-Major Symphony and Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony. As Holoman has pointed out (Berlioz, p. 247), the thematic fragmentation at the end of the Marche de pelerins is also similar to that of the Marcia funebre in the "Eroica." 57 See CG I, 185 (letter of 15 or 16 May 1834) and ATC, pp. 44, 61. 58 Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, IV, p. 78. It is typical of Harold's reception that Tovey discusses the work under the rubric of "Illustrative Music" rather than as a symphony. 59 On this and other thematic connections between Rob Roy and Harold, see Holoman, Berlioz, pp. 144-48.</page><page sequence="36">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY movement and the Allegretto of Beethoven's Seventh, however, the correspondence becomes somewhat more plausible. Other similarities with Beethoven's symphonies are less subtle. The programmatic movement headings and the peasant-inspired music of the third movement are clearly derived from the Pastoral Symphony. The opening of the exposition in the first movement, in turn, bears a strong structural resemblance to the opening of the finale to Beethoven's First: both ideas seem reluctant to begin, pre- ferring instead to grow in an exaggeratedly deliberate fashion, adding only a single note with each successive statement. The entire first movement of Harold, in fact, diffuses the very sense of opening. It is remarkable how many "beginnings" can be heard in this movement: when the soloist first enters at m. 38, with the "Harold" theme, one might well imagine that the entire movement will remain in the origi- nal slow tempo.60 But the onset of the Allegro in m. 94 brings the sense of another beginning. And in retrospect, even this new begin- ning emerges as tentative, for there is still another beginning (the "reluctant" theme) with the onset of the exposition at m. 131. In a dif- ferent context, Leo Treitler has pointed out that the first movement 452 of Beethoven's Ninth also lacks a "hard-edged beginning."61 Once again there are important differences of strategy, however: with each new "beginning," Beethoven returns to the opening idea; Berlioz, on the other hand, introduces a new idea at every corresponding juncture. Harold evokes Beethoven's last symphony in more than the rem- iniscences and rejections at the beginning of its finale. The very idea of fusing the symphony with other genres is itself indebted to Beethoven's Ninth. Beethoven's mixture of genres had of course al- ready been met with no small degree of suspicion and hostility, and these reactions would linger for many decades.62 Yet where Beethoven had added a new element in the finale, the human voice, Berlioz removed the "voice" that had been present throughout the previous three movements. Like Harold, Beethoven's Ninth was crit- icized for the imbalance caused by its finale, if for altogether different reasons. 60 In his labeling of the reminiscences within the finale, Berlioz distinguishes between the "Introduction" and the "Adagio" of the first movement (beginning with the "Harold" theme at m. 38), even though no such distinction appears within the first movement itself, where the entire opening section is labeled "Adagio." 61 Leo Treitler, "History, Criticism, and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony," 19th- Century Music III (1980), 195. 62 See Ruth A.

He was certainly not alone as the object of such comparison: to a great extent, the history of instrumental music in the last three-quarters of the nineteenth century can be seen as an ongoing search for "Beethoven's heir." But as one of Beethoven's earliest and most ar- dent advocates in France and as a composer of symphonies, Berlioz must have felt a special obligation to confront the legacy of the earlier composer. Berlioz's celebrated essays on Beethoven's symphonies extend this confrontation to the realm of criticism, for they, too, reflect a combi- nation of admiration and anxiety. These essays consistently reveal more about their author's own ideas of what a symphony should be than they do about the specific work in question. Interpretation and self-interpretation cannot be clearly distinguished here. Confronted with a puzzling passage, Berlioz almost invariably searched for a "dra- matic motivation." His essay on the Fifth Symphony, to cite an exam- ple quoted earlier, sees the finale as the fate of a "poet musician," thereby postulating a protagonist not unlike that of his own Symphonie fantastique. Any number of individual passages in these essays, more- 453 over, could easily be applied to specific passages of Berlioz's music.63 His comments on the opening movement of Beethoven's Fourth, to cite but one example here, might well serve to describe Harold: "Ex- cept for the meditative Adagio that serves as its introduction, almost the entire first movement is devoted to joy."64 Berlioz's negative criticisms of the symphonies are particularly revealing. It is remarkable, as Wolfgang Domling has pointed out, that Berlioz should have accused Beethoven of "bizarreness" and "ob- scurity" on more than one occasion: these were precisely the same pejoratives that had been directed toward Berlioz's own music.65 Ber- lioz's observations on the opening of the finale of the Ninth Sym- phony, in particular, seem almost willfully obtuse. He devotes con- siderable attention to the nature of the harsh dissonances that appear in mm. 1 and 208 of Beethoven's finale and questions their drama- tic motivation, but he has little to say about the reminiscences 63 See Domling, "Die Symphonie als Drama," pp. 61-68. 64 ATC, p. 47: "Si l'on excepte l'adagio meditatif qui lui sert d'introduction, le premier morceau est presque entierement consacre a la joie." See also the parallels between Berlioz's Symphonie funebre et triomphale and his commentary on the "Eroica," cited below. 65 Domling, "Die Symphonie als Drama," pp. 68-70. See also Reeve, Poetics, pp. 205-17. As Reeve points out, Berlioz sometimes spoke of "bizarre" passages with admiration, and even his negative comments are always presented within a broader context of reverence.</page><page sequence="38">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY themselves.66 Even in Berlioz's own day, this passage was recognized by more than one French critic as the key to the entire work.67 But Berlioz remained curiously unenlightening on this matter in his writ- ings on the Ninth. Indeed, it is ironic that he should have taken Beethoven to task for not elucidating the motivation behind these reminiscences, while failing to address the rationale behind the rem- iniscences at the beginning of Harold's finale. This failure, as we have seen, has caused more than its own share of critical misunder- standing. Yet when viewed within the historical context of its genre, Harold provides a non-verbal commentary that can help bridge this gap. In choosing to structure the work around a protagonist, Berlioz openly evokes the idea of a "heroic" symphony even while acknowledging the impossibility of imitating Beethoven directly through such a work. Harold is a product of its own time, to be sure, coinciding with the Romantics' realization that unalloyed heroism was a thing of the past. But its combination of an anti-heroic stance with the repeated allu- sions to Beethoven is more specifically a manifestation of Berlioz's attempt to "clear mental space," in Bloom's terms, within a field "filled 454 with his precursor's visions."68 Harold preserves the terms of refer- ence established by Beethoven, only to reverse them. In so doing, it represents what Bloom calls the tessera or "antithetical completion" of a precursor's work.69 It is a product of "creative revisionism," a "de- liberate, even perverse revisionism," Berlioz's attempt both to affirm and undo the work of his precursor.70 Only by confronting the "ter- rifying giant" directly could Berlioz be sure of taking the symphony along a "new route." That Berlioz does not address such issues directly in his own writings is not surprising, for like most artists, he refused to recognize or acknowledge the anxiety fostered by a precursor's priority. Brahms's various comments about the burden of writing a symphony after Beethoven, it should be remembered, were never committed to writing; they have been transmitted to us only second-hand. But in the case of both Berlioz and Brahms, the anxiety is evident in the music itself. 66 ATC, pp. 75-76. The essay on the Ninth was first written for La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris of 4 March 1838 and re-published in 1862, with revisions, in ATC. 67 An anonymous review in La Revue musicale of 2 February 1834 calls the series of reminiscences and rejections "the pivot, the center of the entire composition." And Berlioz's friend Urhan, in the review of 1838 (see note 30), specifically calls attention to the enigmatic quality of this passage, "wherein, in our view, lies the key to this grand composition" (quoted in Levy, Early Performances, p. 330). 68 Bloom, Anxiety, p. 66. 69 Bloom, Anxiety, pp. 14, 67. 70 Bloom, Anxiety, pp. 42, 50.</page><page sequence="39">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE IV. Beethoven and Berlioz's Other Symphonies While Harold en Italie is the most openly confron- tational of Berlioz's attempts to deal with Beethoven, it is by no means the only one of his symphonies to grapple with the anxiety of his precursor's influence. Berlioz's ongoing preoccupation with Beethoven would indicate that his own symphonies are not, as has been suggested, sublimated operas.71 Clearly, all of Berlioz's sympho- nies owe a great deal to the traditions of dramatic music; but the symphony was not a genre that Berlioz took up merely because he could not establish himself as a composer of operas. Shortly after completing Harold, in fact, he confided to a close friend that if it were not essential to his financial success, he "would certainly undertake to write many things other than operas. Music has broad wings that the walls of a theater do not allow to be fully extended."72 The need to confront Beethoven was one of the more compelling motivations be- hind Berlioz's repeated efforts in the genre of the symphony. Some of the composer's more perceptive contemporaries sensed this. Robert Schumann, for one, saw the Symphonie fantastique as a "consequence" and to some extent even an "imitation" of the Ninth Symphony. Schumann prefaced his early (1835) and lengthy review of the work with a survey of those recent composers who had at- tempted to write in the shadow of Beethoven's Ninth, "in its external dimensions the greatest of all instrumental works we have." After briefly reviewing the output of many German and Austrian compos- ers, including Ries, Schubert, Spohr, and Mendelssohn, Schumann observed that "it was to be feared that from now on the name 'sym- phony' would belong only to history." Abroad, composers were silent. Cherubini spent long years working on a symphony, but is said to have confessed his incapacity-perhaps too soon and too modestly. All the others in France and Italy were writing operas. Meanwhile, in an obscure corner of the northern French sea- coast a young medical student contemplates something new. Four movements are too few for him; he uses five, like the acts of a play. At first I took Berlioz's symphony to be a consequence [Folge] of Beethoven's Ninth (on other grounds than the five-movement form; this would be no reason at all, for the Ninth has four movements). But the Fantastique was first performed at the Paris Conservatory in 71 See Jeffrey Langford, "The 'Dramatic Symphonies' of Berlioz as an Outgrowth of the French Operatic Tradition," Musical Quarterly LXIX (1983), 91. 72 CG II, 198 (letter of 31 August 1834).</page><page sequence="40">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY 1820, before Beethoven's appeared, so there can be no question of imitation [Nachbildung].73 The significance of this remarkable idea-that the Symphonie fan- tastique was modeled on Beethoven's Ninth-has been obscured by the multitude of factual errors in Schumann's account. Berlioz had of course written his work in 1830, not 1820, and he was working in Paris, not in the provinces. He was, moreover, intimately familiar with all of Beethoven's symphonies, including the Ninth.74 Had Schumann known the correct (or even the approximately correct) date of Ber- lioz's first symphony, we can be reasonably sure that the nature of his review would have pursued the comparison between Berlioz and Beethoven more rigorously. There are two important points to consider here that have noth- ing to do with Schumann's errors of fact: 1) He identifies Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as the standard by which to judge all subsequent works in this genre, and he notes the failure of other composers to rise to the challenge. Berlioz was not alone in his anxiety: Schumann himself had abandoned his own 456 G-Minor Symphony of 1832-33 in an incomplete state-lacking, sig- nificantly, a finale.75 Schubert alone had been able to find another, altogether "different route," but Schumann had not yet discovered the "Great" C-Major Symphony. 2) Schumann's initial reaction to the Symphonie fantastique had been to see it as a "consequence" and "imitation" of Beethoven's Ninth. While there are broad similarities between the two sym- phonies-both take the genre beyond the realm of abstract, "abso- lute" music-the differences are far greater: the Ninth has no explicit program and no ideefixe, and the Symphoniefantastique has no chorus. But it has always been the finale of the Ninth that has established the identity of Beethoven's last symphony, and it seems likely that it was this movement Schumann had in mind when he drew the parallel with the Symphoniefantastique. Both finales feature an extended intro- duction that brings back earlier material, which in turn is ignored for 73 Schumann, "Sinfonie von H. Berlioz," p. 71. In his edition of the Symphonie fantastique, from which this translation is adapted, Cone points out these and other errors of fact in Schumann's review. 74 Although Berlioz had not heard the Ninth Symphony before writing the Sym- phonie fantastique, he had studied a copy of it and proclaimed it to represent the cul- mination of Beethoven's genius; see his essay "Biographie etrangere: Beethoven," Le Correspondant, 6 October 1829, p. 251. 75 See Gerald Abraham, "Schumann's Jugendsinfonie in G Minor," Musical Quar- terly XXXVII (1951), 45-60; andJon Finson, Robert Schumann and the Study of Orchestral Composition: The Genesis of the First Symphony, Op. 38 (Oxford, 1989), pp. 1-17.</page><page sequence="41">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE the remainder of the movement (the reminiscences in the Ninth, the ideefixe in the Symphoniefantastique); a chorale-like theme that appears well after the beginning of each movement (the "Ode to Joy" and the Dies irae); a large internal fugue; and a climactic double fugue that uses the chorale-like theme as one of its subjects. As in Harold, Ber- lioz's application of these devices creates a finale whose character and moral tone are virtually opposite to those of Beethoven's Ninth; but had Schumann known the correct date of the Symphonie fantastique, he presumably would have elaborated on these technical similarities and at the same time pointed out the unusual nature of the "imitation" at work here. What makes Schumann's initial reaction even more remarkable are the obvious parallels between the Symphonie fantastique and the Pastoral. These similarities have often been noted: the division into five movements rather than the customary four; the use of descriptive headings for each movement; and the pastoral nature of the Scene aux champs, which in fact had originally been conceived as the Symphonie fantastique's second movement, making it even more like the Scene am Bach in the Sixth Symphony. But Schumann ignored these similarities in his essay; his initial reaction had been to identify the Ninth as 457 Berlioz's primary model. The similarities between the Symphoniefantastique and Beethoven's Ninth help bring into relief other, more subtle similarities between Berlioz's first two symphonies. Both works begin with the hero alone, followed by a series of scenes in which he is juxtaposed with others, and in both instances, evil triumphs over good, with the hero suffer- ing defeat in the end. The idee fixe and the "Harold" theme both decrease in importance over the course of the work. Paul Banks has rightly pointed out that the former is "negated" step-by-step in each successive movement of the Symphonie fantastique, contributing to the work's "non-resolving overall design." As Banks observes, the finale "does not merely complete the overall process initiated in the earlier ones; it also encapsulates the whole process within itself."76 In Harold, Berlioz applies this strategy with even greater force. Still, there are important differences between Berlioz's first two symphonies. The finale of the Symphonie fantastique is an extended dream from which the musician-poet eventually awakes, in Lelio; in Harold, the nightmare of the finale is no nightmare at all. And there is a basic distinction in character between the heroes of Harold and of the Symphonie fantastique. The latter is a victim of infinite yearning, of 76 Paul Banks, "Coherence and Diversity in the Symphonie fantastique," 19th- Century Music VIII (1984), 39-40.</page><page sequence="42">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY le vague des passions; the idee fixe, accordingly, is long, chromatic, har- monically open. Harold, by contrast, is a solitary figure whose search is inward; the structure of his theme, appropriately, is characterized by rhythmic and harmonic closure (see Example i). Thus, while the idee fixe of the Symphonie fantastique bears certain structural resem- blances to the theme of the "Eroica", as Dahlhaus has pointed out (a diatonic, rhythmically square idea that continues, without any signif- icant break, in a chromatic, syncopated fashion),77 the "Harold" theme is a more or less self-contained unit, as if to symbolize the isolated, self-contained character it represents. The heroes of both works suffer, but they suffer in different ways: one is a victim of longing, the other a victim of Weltschmerz. The differences between the two heroes can also be seen in the elaboration of their respective musical ideas. After the opening "Rev- eries - Passions," the ide fixe of the Symphonie fantastique takes on the character of its environment in all four subsequent movements, whereas the "Harold" theme, as Berlioz himself observed, remains more or less unchanged throughout. The idea of presenting an open- ing theme impervious to motivic manipulation is diametrically op- 458 posed to the Beethovenian concept of symphonic form, especially as manifested in the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. The Symphonie fan- tastique, for all its novelty, does at least preserve the idea of thematic transformation in the permutations of the ideefixe. The same cannot be said of the theme that represents Harold. With its prominent use of vocal forces, Romeo et Juliette (1839) is the one symphony by Berlioz that has traditionally suggested the closest parallels with Beethoven's Ninth. At the beginning of the pref- ace to this work, Berlioz in fact called it a "symphonie avec choeurs," the very phrase commonly used to identify Beethoven's Choral Sym- phony. Yet in many ways, Romeo et Juliette is antithetical to that very work. In the Ninth, it is the vocal forces that come to the aid of the instruments; in Romeo etJuliette, the situation is precisely the opposite. Berlioz assigns the key moments of his "symphonie dramatique," in- cluding the climatic scene at the tomb, to the orchestra alone, without recourse to a sung text.78 Elsewhere in the preface to his work, he explained that If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the dramatic scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral 77 Dahlhaus, Nineteenth-Century Music, pp. 155-56. 78 See Wolfgang D6mling, Hector Berlioz: Die symphonisch-dramatischen Werke (Stutt- gart, 1979), pp. 102-03.</page><page sequence="43">BERLIOZ'S HAROLD EN ITALIE masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sud- den appearance would have damaged the composition's unity.79 This preface, because of its late date (it first appeared in the vocal score of 1858), has been interpreted as anti-Wagnerian, and to a degree it is;8o but given Berlioz's insistence on the genre of his new work as a "choral symphony," it is directed even more squarely against Beethoven's Ninth. In Romeo etJuliette, words provide the context for the instrumental movements, not vice versa. The crucial event of this work is not the choral (quasi-operatic) finale, but the instrumental scene of Romeo at the tomb of the Capulets. There is, moreover, yet another inversion of the Ninth's reminiscences in Romeo etJuliette: the Prologue's "review" of themes from subsequent movements is not a retrospective, but a premonition. One senses in all of this a certain desire on Berlioz's part to dis- tance himself from the Ninth Symphony. Given his open admiration for that work and its obvious influence on Romeo et Juliette, this atti- tude may seem at first somewhat paradoxical. But it is the very obvi- ousness of Berlioz's debt that helps explain the concomitant need to establish a critical distance. Berlioz recognized that his own "Choral 459 symphony" would be compared to Beethoven's; this, in turn, led him to seek (and, in his preface, emphasize) the "different route" he had taken in composing his own Symphonie avec choeurs. His enthusiasm for the Ninth, in other words, prompted the need for its implicit denial. There is indirect but important evidence for the extent of Ber- lioz's preoccupation with Beethoven's last symphony in Urhan's 1838 review of the Ninth, cited earlier. Urhan's description of the work includes a curious account of Beethoven's working methods: He read Shakespeare during the entire time he wrote the Symphony with Chorus. He devoted all his free time when he wasn't working to King Lear, Hamlet, and Macbeth. While reading, he took notes in a small album. Precious album, what has become of you? Oh! how I would give all the exhumed mosaics of Pompeii in order to retrieve you! Divine little book, precious confidant of the conversation of these two great geniuses!

But alas! The album is lost, and Beethoven is dead, carrying away with him the secret of this grand work.. . .81 The source of this fanciful anecdote-nothing is known of such an album-may well have been Berlioz himself. Urhan, unlike Ber- lioz, was not a regular journalist, nor do his letters reveal a compara- ble veneration for Shakespeare. And it seems reasonable to assume that Urhan would have discussed this review in advance with Berlioz, his good friend and fellow Beethoven-enthusiast.82 The idea of asso- ciating a symphony with a specific Shakespearean work or scene is in fact reminiscent of Berlioz's own Grande Fantaisie dramatique sur La Tempete (1830) and Grande Ouverture du roi Lear (1831). Shakespeare was also an acknowledged source of inspiration for the Symphonie fantastique, whose title page, in the autograph score, bears a quotation from King Lear ("Nous sommes aux dieux ce que sont les mouches / aux folatres enfans; ils nous tuent pour s'amuser").83 And although Urhan's review appeared almost a year before Berlioz began intensive work on Romeo et Juliette, we know that he had contemplated a sym- 460 phony on this particular drama for some time, perhaps even as early as 1827-28.84 If Berlioz was indeed the source of this anecdote, then he was, in essence, projecting his own state of mind for writing a Shakespearean "symphony with chorus" retrospectively onto Bee- thoven. And if it was someone other than Berlioz who fabricated this account, then its appearance in print only a year before Romeo et Juliette would have provided a still stronger justification for the com- poser's anxiety. In either case, Berlioz's desire to distance himself from the Ninth, both in the preface and in the music itself, is more understandable. 81 Urhan, review of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Le Temps, 25 January 1838, quoted in Levy, Early Performances, p. 329. 82 At the beginning of the first version of his essay on the Ninth (Revue et Gazette musicale, 4 March 1838, p. 97), Berlioz cited Urhan's review, but subsequently dropped the reference when he re-worked the essay for ATC. Urhan's correspondence from Paris includes references to Beethoven as early as i81o; he dedicated his Op. i to Beethoven and in later years arranged to have a Mass said on the anniversary of the composer's death.

Commissioned for a cere- mony honoring the victims of the July Revolution of 1830, the work cannot be directly compared to Berlioz's three previous symphonies. The exigencies of performance demanded an altogether different approach: "This time I wrote so big that even myopic people could read me," Berlioz wrote to his father two days after the work's suc- cessful premiere, "and, extraordinarily, there was not a single oppo- nent" among the critics.85 "It seemed to me that for such a work the simpler the plan the better.. ."86 What is striking in this regard is how much the final plan of the revised version resembles and even openly imitates Beethoven, at least on a superficial level. The work had originally been written without chorus and called Symphonie mili- taire, its second movement Hymne d'Adieu. For the concert version, prepared two years later in 1842, Berlioz renamed the entire work Symphoniefunebre et triomphale, added strings, changed the name of the middle movement to Oraison funebre (Berlioz's precise term for the "Eroica" as a whole), and added, in the finale, a chorus, with a text by 461 Anthoni Deschamps ("Gloire et triomphe a ces Heros!"). Here, at last, Berlioz had written his heroic symphony, consisting of a funeral march (first movement), followed by an extended instrumental reci- tative (second movement) that leads to a choral finale of glory, joy, and victory. When Berlioz writes: "The hero has cost us many tears; after these last regrets paid to his memory, the poet turns from the elegy to intone with rapture the hymn of glory," he is speaking not of his own Symphoniefunebre et triomphale, but of Beethoven's "Eroica."87 The ease with which this description could be applied to either work manifests the important links between them. The general layout of Berlioz's last symphony appears to have had its genesis in a specifically Napoleonic symphony, Le Retour de l'armee d'ltalie: Simphonie militaire en 2 parties. His initial plan for this work, conceived during his own return from Italy in 1832, was to begin with a farewell to the fallen (Adieux du haut des Alpes aux braves tombes dans les champs d'Italie), followed by a 85 CG II, 649 (letter of 30 July 1840): "Cette fois, j'ai ecrit si gros, que les miopes [sic] ont pu me lire.

Beethoven was still very much on his mind at this time: the sole extant musical jottings for this work consists of a passage that bears a strong resemblance to the finale to Beethoven's Fifth (see Example 12).88 In his Beethoven essay of 1829, Berlioz had already noted that the hero of the "Eroica" was not Napoleon the emperor, but the "Victor of Arcola."89 That Berlioz should have singled out Arcola from all of 462 Napoleon's many battles is almost certainly due to the idea of hero- ism: this battle of 1796 from the Italian Campaign, as one historian has noted, "centers on the personality of the hero" more than any other episode of the French Revolutionary Wars, and "perhaps of any wars in modern history.... Bonaparte had so thoroughly imbued [his troops] with his own will to conquer that in the end they prevailed over an enemy nearly twice their own strength."9o To Berlioz, the hero of Le Retour de l'armee d'Italie was the same hero as that of the "Eroica." But by 1834, Berlioz had recognized that he could no longer-or rather, could not yet-write such an unabashedly heroic symphony. Such a work would inevitably have been compared to the "Eroica." It would have challenged Beethoven too directly. Berlioz nevertheless returned to the idea of a heroic symphony shortly after finishing the anti-heroic Harold. In the spring of 1835, he wrote to Humbert Ferrand (Harold's dedicatee) of his hopes for com- posing a "third symphony on a vast and new plan" during the summer 88 See Holoman, Berlioz, p. 130; idem, "The Berlioz Sketchbook Recovered," 19th-Century Music VII (1984), 290-91. This idea appears alongside another that would eventually become the second theme of the Orgie de brigands. 89 Berlioz, "Biographie 6trangere: Beethoven," Le Correspondant, 11 August 1829, p. 187.

By 23 August he had begun "an immense composition" en- titled Fete musicale funebre a la memoire des hommes illustres de la France.9s The work was no longer specifically cited as a symphony, and no trace of it has survived under this title. But it seems almost certain, as Holoman argues, that one of its two movements became the funeral march of the Symphonie funebre et triomphale.92 With its strong Napoleonic associations and overt structural par- allels to Beethoven's Third and Ninth Symphonies, the Symphonie funebre et triomphale can in one sense be seen to manifest Berlioz's conquest of his anxiety about writing a heroic symphony. Stylistically, however, Berlioz's last symphony owes far too much to the tradition of French Revolutionary music for it to be considered a manifestation of apophrades, the sixth and last of Bloom's "revisionary ratios," in which the precursor's art is so fully assimilated that one might almost think it is "the later poet himself [who] had written the precursor's characteristic work."93 The openly popular style of the Symphonie fu- nebre et triomphale, its limited aesthetic demands, and its temporal subject-matter make the work more closely akin to Wellingtons Sieg than to any of Beethoven's numbered symphonies. And while the Marcia funebre of the "Eroica" owes much to the style of French Rev- 463 olutionary music,94 Berlioz is not emulating Beethoven so much as drawing on a common source. Only in the earlier concert symphonies did Berlioz seek to extend the limits of the genre along "another route" by directly confronting his precursor. And of these, it is Harold en Italie, the most anti-heroic of his symphonies, that most profoundly manifests Berlioz's indebtedness to the legacy of Beethoven.
