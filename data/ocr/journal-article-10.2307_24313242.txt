<plain_text><page sequence="1">OVULATION TIME IN PRIMATES James H. Elder Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology, Orange Park For several years there has been a lively controversy on the ques tion of periodic fertility and sterility in primates. The fact that this problem was solved long ago for other mammals may be at tributed to greater freedom for controlled observations. Because of certain conventional restrictions on the use of human subjects, much of our accurate knowledge of the problem has come from ex perimental work with monkeys and apes. According to the periodic fertility hypothesis, as it applies to those primates exhibiting menstruation, ovulation occurs once during the cycle. Unless the male germ cells are present at this time, or within a few hours, there will be no fertilization. The hypothesis excludes the possibility of additional or so-called "spontaneous" ovulation at other times in the cycle. A large amount of clinical and experi mental evidence gives much support to this hypothesis, and it is now fully accepted by many biologists. It is not the purpose of this report to argue the case for periodic sterility from data which are already available. This was done most thoroughly by Hartman " in 1936. After reading his summary one is impressed by the lack of good experimental evidence and care ful observation and recording. The present report deals with re search of the type which Hartman himself has offered as necessary for a solution of the problem. One of the primary aims in using apes and monkeys for research purposes is to obtain knowledge useful to man. Since I am about to describe results obtained with chimpanzees instead of women it will be necessary that we agree on a few fundamental points before we can accept the pertinence or validity of such evidence in its applica tion to primates in general. It is not necessary that we assume ovulation in man and ape to be governed by identical processes— this is one of the points to be demonstrated—but it is necessary that we appreciate the similarity of physiological function in the primates. 1 This report is based upon results of investigations supported by the Com mittee for Research in Problems of Sex, National Research Council, at the Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology.

One who is reluctant to admit genetic relationships of man and other primates and attempts to rationalize other anthropomorphic charac teristics of the ape is usually awed by the menstrual cycle. It should be remembered that the phenomenon of menstruation appears only in some of the higher primates—old world monkeys, anthropoid apes, and man. The length of the menstrual cycle is the same in several species. Graphic representations of 1000 cycles in rhesus monkeys and women are indistinguishable, both showing medians and modes of 28 days. As far as we have been able to discover the activity of endocrine glands, and changes in the ovary, uterus, and vagina bear the same relationship to the cycle in the dif - ferent species. There are several characteristics of the chimpanzee which make it an ideal subject for sex research. Those which make it especially suitable for ovulation studies are a cycle length of 35 days—extend ing the possibility of comparisons with other primates—and the presence of external genital swelling corresponding to the period of follicular development. Most of our knowledge of ovulation time in the chimpanzee has been obtained through the use of the controlled mating technique. The following brief description of this method, quoted from a pub lished report3 on the sexual cycle of the chimpanzee, will facilitate interpretation of the illustrations: This method consists simplj- of permitting a single, effective, sexual con tact for a limited period of time within the cycle and subsequently deter mining whether or not fertilization has occurred. Before the procedure he gins to yield positive results, however, much preliminary work is necessary. A subject may be allowed to mate only once during a cycle which means that several weeks are required for each trial. As an aid at the outset to the selection of appropriate days for mating were the records of sexual be havior, from which it was possible to make a few general predictions. For example, there were several instances of failure to mate during earlv and late phases of the cycle and when mating did occur only at these times it was, without exception, infertile. . . . The procedure originally adopted began with a series of mating opportunities using a given female at a late, probably infertile period of the cycle, and gradually advancing (usually by 1 day) the date of mating in succeeding cycles. Thus, for example, a female was used on the twenty-fifth day of a given cycle, the twenty-fourth day of the next, and so on until a fertile mating occurred. 3 Elder, J. H., and Yerkes, R. M., "The Sexual Cycle of the Chimpanzee," Auot. Rec.. Vol. 67 (1936), p. 133.</page><page sequence="3">OVULATION TIME IN PRIVATES 125 Early this year results of an extensive series of controlled matings were reported which showed that the period of fertility in the typical chimpanzee cycle was between days 16 and 20. Analysis of these data showed that the time of ovulation in a given individual was closely related to length of cycle exhibited. That is, the earliest dates of fertile matings were found in subjects with the shortest cycles, the latest dates in those with long cycles. This seemed to indicate the necessity of considering each case individually, but it was also noted that ovulation always occurred during the last few days of genital swelling, irrespective of the length or regularity of cycles. This was an important confirmation of the hypothesis that the degree of swelling reflected follicular maturation. For several years this period of genital enlargement has been referred to as the follicular phase of the cycle, because it was assumed that develop ment of follicles produced the swelling. Recently we have been able to demonstrate conclusively that the female sex hormone, estrin, is the cause of this phenomenon. When the ripened follicle bursts there is a diminution in secretion of estrin. This event is indicated externally by detumescence. The external sign is very convenient. We cannot know from ap pearances whether ovulation has occurred in a given cycle—some of them probably are sterile—but if it has we can date it approximately. Furthermore, no ovulation could occur in the chimpanzee without the prerequisite enlargement of a follicle and the estrual swelling accompanying it. Our menstrual histories show another significant relationship. In mature females detumescence appears 12 days before the subse quent menstrual period. The relative constancy of this period makes possible a generalized and yet more precise statement of ovulation time for all chimpanzees. The 15th day before menstrua tion is the time when fertility is greatest. The small deviations from this point may represent nothing more than the viability periods of sperm and ova. The foregoing statement is in exact agreement with Knaus's hypo thesis concerning ovulation time in women. The only difference is that I should prefer to make some allowance for variations until cer tain refinements in our technique of observations are accomplished. However, should anyone doubt that the conclusion is highly reliable my best answer is that it works. As we continue to enlarge our series of observations we are also applying the results practically in our breeding program. Within a iew weeks we were able to arrange for and, with the</page><page sequence="4">126 PROCEEDINGS OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES cooperation of Doctor Hartman of the Carnegie Laboratories of Embryology, accomplish the recovery of a fertilized egg just after implantation. Without a sound basis for prediction we might have wasted months or years on such a task. What is the significance of this work with apes in solving human problems? For those who are reluctant to make direct comparisons two suggestions may be offered. The results with monkeys and apes strongly indicate the desirability of more accurate and extensive recording of data relating to the sex life of an individual. Predic tions cannot be made from scanty histories ; they can and are being mane accurately from good records. It may be argued that women, because of an infinitely more com plex mode of life, show greater irregularity than other primates under the relatively uniform conditions of captivity. This may be true but it is not a sound reason for neglecting the problem of ac curate recording. Since the chimpanzee exhibits striking overt effects of the follicular hormone, estrin, it seems rather odd that no signs whatever are to be found in women. The hormone is present. It appears and dis appears as a result of the same process. And it produces internal changes which are much the same. Perhaps there is some clue which has been overlooked. Even though it is not obvious there may be a relatively simple means of detecting it. Investigation is now in progress in a few laboratories on the measurement of differences in electrical potential associated with the ovulatory process. Similar attempts are being made with chimpanzees at the Yale Laboratories (Finch, Yerkcs, Elder). There are certain technical difficulties which have led to some equi vocal results but these will be overcome eventually. The possibility of detecting ovulation by a method almost as simple as that of taking temperature or pulse readings is truly a cause for speculation on the sociological consequences apart from scientific achievement.
