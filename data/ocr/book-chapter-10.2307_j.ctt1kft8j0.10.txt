<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> F i v e A  Woman at a Well O f  t h e  m a n y  m e a n i n g s  and meta phors attached to the rites of  initiation, a central one remains to be examined: how did Christians in  Dura- Europos imagine the descent, reception, or incarnation of the  Holy Spirit? In his study “Baptismal Patterns in Early Syria,” liturgical historian  Bryan Spinks rec ords a hunch about how Syrian Christians understood  the connection between the ritual of anointing and the descent of the Holy  Spirit at initiation.1 What text or narrative would they have had in mind to  lend meaning to the ritual? Previous scholars have usually looked to the  baptismal accounts of Jesus himself, and indeed there is evidence to sup- port a notion of Christ’s baptismal “initiation” as the exemplar for Chris- tians’ initiations.2 Spinks notes, however, that the distinctive prebaptismal  anointing in Syria does not correspond to the accounts of Jesus’ baptism:  “In the Synoptic accounts of the baptism of Jesus, for all their diff erences,  the descent of the Spirit, or messianic declaration, comes  after the baptism  in  water. A better paradigm might be theological, namely, the incarnation  of Jesus and then his baptism, where the messianic Spirit hovers at concep- tion to bring forth new birth. The themes of the invocations on the oil  combine new birth and fertility, as well as cleansing and remission of sins.”3  Drawing on his vast knowledge of Syriac ritual texts, Spinks conjectures  that the analogy Christ’s incarnation : baptism :: Christians’ anointing :  baptism would better connect biblical narrative to ritual logic. Gregory the  Great also connects the incarnation to anointing when interpreting the  “oil of gladness” from Psalm 45: “To be conceived by the Holy Spirit of the  fl esh of the Virgin was itself to be anointed by the Holy Spirit.”4 Christ’s  155 </page> <page sequence="2"> 156 A  Woman at a Well incarnation was his anointing, and Christian anointing enacted, in turn,  an incarnation and new birth in the Spirit. We now follow Isseos  toward the door exiting the baptistery, look- ing again at the southern wall, where he was anointed. I argue that Spinks’s  hunch can fi nd support from the fi nal extant painting in the Dura- Europos  baptistery: the fi gure of a  woman at a well on the western part of this wall.  Despite the nearly unanimous opinion that the painting portrays the  Samaritan  Woman from the Gospel of John— known colloquially as “the   woman at the well”— I contend that the painting ought at least to be inter- preted as polysemic and ought probably to be interpreted as a portrayal of  a  diff erent, even more famous “ woman at a well”: the Virgin Mary at the  Annunciation and incarnation of Jesus. Like the pro cession of  women, this  fi gure models the ritual activity of the initiates: through a divine encoun- ter at a well of  water, she receives the illumination and incarnation of the  Holy Spirit. Challenging the Consensus: Which  Woman Is It? On the southern wall, near the baptismal font, one sees a  woman bent over  a well (plate 9 and fi g. 5.1). She is holding the rope of her  water vessel and  looking out at the viewer, or perhaps over her shoulder. She is alone. There  was space to paint another person  behind her, as plate 9 shows, but that  space is empty.5 The image has usually been regarded as depicting the  Samaritan  Woman at the Well— according to Kraeling, “interpreters have  had no doubts”— and almost no one has doubted it since. Indeed, there are  connections with baptismal ritual to warrant that identifi cation.6 The pre- text for the episode in the Gospel of John is that Jesus was  under suspi- cion of “making and baptizing more disciples than John [the Baptist]”  ( John 4:1), and so he left Judea and headed back to Galilee, passing through  Samaria.7 The baptismal allusions continue at the well of Jacob, where he  engages the  woman in a dialogue about “living  water” (ὕδωρ ζῶν), a  phrase that carries a double entendre. She thinks he is speaking about  water  that is moving and thus fresh—o ur metap hor is “ running”  water; theirs  was “living”  water— instead of stagnant  water, but he explains that he can  </page> <page sequence="3"> A  Woman at a Well 157 Fig. 5.1.

(Yale Uni- versity Art Gallery, Dura- Europos Collection) give what becomes “a spring of  water gushing up to eternal life” (4:14).  This continues Jesus’ teaching that “ water and spirit” are necessary for  eternal life (3:5). Other early Christian texts resonate with this text- image relationship.  The promotion of “living” or “ running”  water as the best  water for Chris- tian baptism is exemplifi ed in the Didache (ὕδωρ ζῶν, 7.1–2), likely of  Syrian provenance. The common interpretation of the Samaritan  woman  as a sinner in need of repentance also implies the connection of baptism  with repentance in early Chris tian ity (e.g., Mark 1:4–5). Some early Chris- tian authors, such as Tertullian and Ephrem, connect the Samaritan   Woman directly to baptism,8 and the narrative may even have had a litur- gical Sitz im Leben during the ancient catechumenate, at least as attested in  </page> <page sequence="4"> 158 A  Woman at a Well the fourth- century West.9 Finally, one other baptistery from late antiquity,  San Giovanni in Fonte (Naples), includes the Samaritan  Woman with  Jesus as part of its artistic program.10 Seeing the painting at Dura- Europos  as the Samaritan  Woman has often encouraged, therefore, an interpretation  of the baptismal ritual primarily as repentance and cleansing of sin  through living  water. We should recall, though, that  women visit wells all over the biblical  landscape. Betrothal at a well is a type- scene in the Hebrew Bible: Rebecca  and Isaac, Rachel and Jacob, Zipporah and Moses. Each meeting involves  courtship and marriage, and the Gospel of John adapts this motif or “bends  the genre,” subverting the expectation of its audience.11 What’s more, the  absence of Jesus from this painting distinguishes it from all the other  well- known repre sen ta tions of John 4, as we will see below. In other ex- amples, the Samaritan  woman stands in a posture of dialogue with Jesus,  who sits on or stands near the well. Below we analyze other features that are  formally incongruous with the Samaritan  Woman. For some of these rea- sons, Kraeling himself hesitated in his identifi cation and entertained the  possibility that the biblical account of Rebecca at the well (Gen 24) had  inspired the image in question, on the basis of Ephrem’s many allusions to  Rebecca and Laban and also the geo graph i cal proximity of Dura- Europos  to the legendary site of that event (in Harran, Roman Carrhae, northern  Mesopotamia).12 Ultimately, though, the evidence for Rebecca is weak,  and Kraeling opted for the accepted identifi cation of the painting, thereby  solidifying the consensus about John 4.  Until now, I know of only one  other scholar who has dissented from it. The Annunciation at the Well: Textual Traditions Dominic Serra has suggested, in a very brief treatment, that a noncanoni- cal tradition captured in the Protevangelium of James might better explain  the image.13 He proposes that the more prominent “ woman at the well” in  Syrian Chris tian ity was the Virgin Mary, and my own research expands  into a full argument what he fi rst noted in a short paragraph.14 According  to the Protevangelium, Mary was no mean peasant, but the beloved  </page> <page sequence="5"> A  Woman at a Well 159 dau gh ter of the wealthy Joachim and Anne. They consecrated her to the   temple, and she was chosen as one of the “pure virgins of the tribe of  David” called forth to work on weaving the veil for the  temple of the Lord.15  Through a casting of lots, she received the “scarlet” and the “pure purple”  threads to spin as her ser vice. But one day, during a break from her work,  “she took the pitcher and went forth to draw  water, and behold, a voice  said: ‘Hail, you are highly favored, the Lord is with you, blessed are you  among  women.’ And she looked around on the right and on the left to see from  where this voice could have come. Then trembling she went [to her  house?]  and put down the pitcher and took the purple and sat down on her chair  [throne?] and drew out (the thread).”16 In this narrative tradition, the initial  greeting of the angel occurs not inside, but outside; not in Mary’s home or  the  temple, but at a nearby  water source— either a well or a spring. Next,   after she was back at home spinning, “an angel of the Lord stood before her”  and this time she saw it. Only then did the angel continue with the speech  so familiar from the canonical account of the Annunciation (Luke 1:26–38). It is im por tant to note straightaway that the Protevangelium of James,  also called the “Nativity of Mary,” the “Revelation of James,” or the “Book  of James” in late antiquity, was no fringe text. It was likely composed from  oral traditions in the mid- second  century and was widely disseminated, es- pecially in the East. Manuscripts of it exist in every relevant language from  late antiquity through the medieval period: Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Arme- nian, Latin, Ethiopic, Georgian, Arabic, and Old Church Slavonic.17 As  Stephen Shoemaker has shown, texts such as this one, surviving in “almost  innumerable copies” and transmitting “among the most infl uential extra-  biblical traditions of the Christian faith,” are not properly thought of as “re- jected scriptures” or failed Gospels.18 On the contrary, “some are better  understood as an accepted part of ecclesiastical Tradition,” especially “the  Marian apocrypha of early Chris tian ity.”19 Shoemaker notes that “even an  arch- conservative such as Epiphanius cites apocryphal material as an au- thoritative part of Christian Tradition,” recounting information about  Mary’s parents drawn from the Protevangelium.20 As the narration of the  oldest extant hagiographic tales about the young Mary, the Protevangelium  was inevitably pop u lar, and this popularity was then augmented by the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 160 A  Woman at a Well rising attraction of asceticism and consecrated virginity during the third  and fourth centuries. That is to say, the text’s predominant motif is the  virginal purity of Mary. Moreover, George Zevros has argued that the oldest manuscript of  the Protevangelium of James (from the Bodmer papyri) reveals an even ear- lier layer of the narrative.21 Zevros removes the secondary “corrective”  hand from the papyrus and aims not to assimilate the fi rst hand’s version  to  later versions in the manuscript tradition. What he concludes is that this  ancient, perhaps early second- century, narrative did not include a “second  Annunciation” at Mary’s  house at all. Rather, she heard the voice while  drawing  water and then returned to the  temple, from whence she had come.  Indeed, according to Tacitus, there was an “ever- fl owing spring of  water”  there; this may or may not be the same as that which  later came to be called  the “Fountain of the Virgin,” because of “an opinion that she frequently  came hither to drink.”22 Zevros shows that the references to Mary’s “house”  are “foremost among the secondary passages which assist in harmonizing  the interpolated canonical material” from Luke with this other ancient tra- dition.23 He argues that each instance of Mary  going to her  house impedes  the normal fl ow of the narrative, which is other wise focused on her life as  a consecrated virgin in the  temple. If Mary returned to the  temple  after the  Annunciation, that would also help to explain why her seat is called by the  elevated term “throne” (θρόνος).24 Zevros’s assessment deserves serious  consideration, based as it is on papyrological evidence, a logical analy sis  of the narrative’s redactions, and the theological connection to the  temple.  Indeed, at this chapter’s end, artistic evidence will be off ered that may sup- port his theory. Other textual traditions corroborate the importance of what we call  the “Annunciation at the Well” or the “Annunciation at the Spring.” The  so- called “Gospel of Pseudo- Matthew,” which was also called “The Na- tivity of the Blessed Mary and the Infancy of the Savior,” is  later than the  Protevangelium of James and fl ourished mostly in the West. However, it  too had a great infl uence on the history of Christian art and piety. Its  recounting of the two annunciations specifi es in the fi rst one the “fountain/ spring” and eliminates the previous tradition of the angel’s initial invisi- </page> <page sequence="7"> A  Woman at a Well 161 bility: “And on the second day, while Mary was at the fountain to fi ll her  pitcher, the angel of the Lord appeared to her, saying: Blessed are you,  Mary; for in your womb you have prepared a habitation for the Lord.”25 It  also connects the notion of illumination to the incarnation as the angel con- tinues: “For, lo, the light from heaven shall come and dwell in you, and by  means of you will shine over the  whole world.”26 The following day fi nds  Mary back at home spinning and receiving the second visit from the angel. In other eastern traditions of the life of the Virgin, the Annunciation  at the Well is emphasized and even interpreted. The vari ous versions of the  “Armenian Gospel of the Infancy” narrate the Annunciation at a  water  source, one of many connections in textual and artistic traditions between  Syria and Armenia.27 Ephrem seems to presume an Annunciation at a well  during his Hymns on Nativity: “Come all you mouths, pour out and be- come a type of  water and wells of voices; let the Spirit of truth come! Let Her  sing praise in all of us to the  Father who redeemed us by His Child. Most  blessed of all is His birth!”28 Finally, the great Byzantine theologian Maxi- mus the Confessor, whose Life of the Virgin has recently been translated by  Stephen Shoemaker from the surviving manuscripts in Old Georgian,  waxes eloquent about the fi ttingness of the place of Annunciation: “the  archangel Gabriel was sent by God . . .  and he announced to the Virgin  Mary the glorious and wonderful Annunciation, ineff able and incompre- hensible, the foundation and beginning of all good things. And when, how,  and where did the Annunciation take place? The virgin was fasting and  standing in prayer near a fountain, because she conceived the fountain  of life.”29 Let us now return to ponder the fi gure at Dura- Europos. At the fi rst  Annunciation scene in the Protevangelium, Mary’s certainty of her solitude  is characterized by her looking all around in wonderment for whence the  voice could have come (πόθεν αὕτη εἴη ἡ φωνή). There is no indication  that the voice came from an angel; indeed, the voice of God—or the bat kol  of Hebrew tradition—is more likely.30 Therefore, one cogent explanation  of the vacant space  behind the  woman in the Dura- Europos image is that  it represents (or rather, does not represent) the bodiless voice of the apoc- ryphal Annunciation.31 In the story, as in the art, the Annunciation’s speaker  </page> <page sequence="8"> 162 A  Woman at a Well was invisible. From  behind Mary, on the wall as in the narrative, the ab- sence speaks. Ancient Annunciations: Artistic Comparanda With a thriving devotion to Mary already developed in the fi rst Christian  centuries, it is not surprising that she began to be portrayed artistically.  Indeed, in some locales, she came to be depicted more prominently and  frequently than Christ himself. But can most modern viewers— even fre- quent museum- goers— call to mind an image of the Annunciation to Mary  at a spring, fountain, or well? Viewers of art in the modern West can be forgiven for not imagining  the Annunciation at a well. Most of us have in mind some Re nais sance  masterpiece, such as Botticelli’s in the Uffi  zi museum (1489). Or consider  an example exhibited closer to my own home: when I take my students to the  medieval Cloisters Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we be- hold the exquisite indoor, domestic Annunciation scene of Robert Campin  (fi g. 5.2, ca. 1427–32). Though innovative in its time, it yet retains formal  features of late Byzantine and medieval iconography: Mary is seated and  reading (presumably the prophecies about her recorded in scripture); the  lines of incarnation subtly penetrate the glass of the win dow on the left side  of the painting and approach her womb; the angel Gabriel is visible in  human  form, and she will encounter him face- to- face. But a closer look at the scene,  with a  diff erent artistic trajectory in mind, shows that Campin has also re- tained a feature from the ancient tradition of the well. Like a vestigial organ,  past which the Annunciation’s artistic form has evolved, this object sits none- theless at the center of the scene. There on the  table— forgotten but not  gone— rests Mary’s old pitcher of  water, repurposed as a vase for a fl ower. The artistic traditions of the Annunciation that led from antiquity to  the Re nais sance cannot be perfectly charted, but we can collect a morphol- ogy of types from our extant sources that helps to demonstrate the options  available in late antiquity and the Byzantine era. At its basic level, the ico- nography can consist of merely a  woman and a winged angel standing  together, as on some Byzantine censers; in a context of a cycle of scenes,  </page> <page sequence="9"> A  Woman at a Well 163 Fig. 5.2.  Middle panel of the Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece), Robert  Campin and assistant, ca. 1427–32. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,  56.70b. The Cloisters Collection, 1956. www . metmuseum . org . ) that is enough to signify the Annunciation. Most types fi ll out details of  vari ous narrative traditions, and the most im por tant of these follow below,  according to my own classifi cation system.32 Before that, however, two anomalous Annunciation types from the  Roman catacombs must be briefl y summarized. In one of the oldest parts  </page> <page sequence="10"> 164 A  Woman at a Well of the catacomb of Priscilla, in the upper- right corner of an arcosolium, an  image of a mo ther holding her infant was painted.33 A male fi gure next to  her extends his arm, pointing  either at her or upwards. Modern viewers  have typically seen a par tic u lar photograph of the restored painting that  appears to show a veiled mo ther and the male fi gure pointing up at a star.  This would be Mary holding Jesus, with a fi gure,  either an angel or a  prophet (such as Balaam, Num 24:15–17), indicating the prophesied star  of the incarnation and nativity. However, scholars have recently interro- gated these identifi cations. Geri Palbry has noted that the oldest drawing  of the scene, done by Antonio Bosio, contains “no star above the head of  the   woman and the fi gure standing in front of them is clearly pointing  at them and not up into the sky.”34 Prominent catacomb explorer Josef  Wilpert, in fact, has been accused of “touching up” the painting in the  early twentieth  century, and contemporary Italian archaeologist Fabrizio  Bisconti “uncovered evidence of changes in the painting,” including a   diff erent type of paint used for part of the male fi gure and the star.35 Recent  scholars have argued, then, that this fresco may be “a poignant funerary  portrait of a dead mo ther and child.”36 A second Annunciation type, evidenced elsewhere in the catacomb  of Priscilla and also in that of Peter and Marcellinus, features a seated   woman being addressed in speech by a standing man. Regarding the bet- ter preserved example from the catacomb of Priscilla, Bosio’s drawing  shows a togate, senatorial Roman man with his arm extended in speech to  a “seated  woman veiled and looking downcast.”37 If correctly identifi ed,  this would probably be the oldest scene of the Annunciation proper, but  Bosio did not identify it as such. In recent de cades, many historians have  agreed with Bosio, since the scene lacked features to distinguish it from  other scenes of formal address.38 In a recent survey of the materials, art his- torian Elżbieta Jastrzębowska has argued that such a scene is “insuffi  - ciently specifi c,” lacking any of the indicators from Marian tradition— a   water source, a  water vessel, spinning instruments— that signify an Annun- ciation dialogue.39 In any case, even if these two catacomb paintings  were  intended as Annunciation scenes, these types did not become common- place in the artistic traditions of the Annunciation, to which we now turn. </page> <page sequence="11"> A  Woman at a Well 165 A Morphology of Annunciations 1. Aside from the disputed examples from the catacombs, the most ancient  extant type seems to be the Annunciation At the Spring. In this type, Mary  stoops down with a pitcher in order to draw  water from a spring or water- fall that fl ows out from a rock. She usually looks backward, over her shoul- der, at Gabriel who approaches from  behind. Probably the oldest example  is preserved on the sarcophagus of Adelphia (fourth  century, Syra- cuse), which is distinctive among the group in its portrayal of a bearded  divinity— presumably that of the  water source— emerging from the top of  the rock.40 Anthropomorphic divinities of rivers and  water sources  were  not uncommon in ancient or early Christian art (e.g., the Jordan River can  be depicted in  human form), but in this group the other extant examples  show only the  water or perhaps a tree sprouting nearby.41 The paradig- matic example of the group is probably that from an ivory book cover (fi fth   century, Milan), which shows Mary adorned in a dress and necklace  (fi g. 5.3).42 Another fi fth- century example occurs on the “Werden casket”  (Victoria and Albert Museum, London).43 Examples from the East include  a terracotta pilgrim token (ca. sixth  century, Monza) from Palestine, about  which more will be said below, and the Egyptian “Mary Silk” textile  (Abegg- Stiftung, Riggisberg, Switzerland), which is unique in not showing  a  water source next to Mary’s pitcher.44 Instead, the scene abuts a nativity  scene with a brick manger and a donkey.45 Finally, an Armenian manu- script illumination varies the theme by showing a kind of  water spigot or  pipe,  under which Mary holds her pitcher.46 2. The Spinning, Looking Back type bears some formal similarity to  the At the Spring type, in that Mary is other wise occupied with a domestic  task when Gabriel surprises her from  behind. But  here she is indoors and  spinning— the second Annunciation scene from noncanonical sources.  The most well- known example comes from a metal pilgrimage fl ask (sixth   century, Monza), in which Mary looks back from her work to see Gabriel,  who points up to the greeting, “Hail!” (see more below) (fi g. 5.4).47 Another  pilgrimage fl ask from Bobbio, Italy, places the basket of thread in between  Mary and the angel, similar to a scene on a well- preserved ivory pyxis (sixth  </page> <page sequence="12"> 166 A  Woman at a Well Fig. 5.3. At the Spring type of Annunciation (upper left) on ivory  diptych (detail of two Marian scenes). Milan Cathedral trea- sury. (Carlo Romussi [public  domain])  century, Cleveland), in which a seated Mary looks back over the basket at  Gabriel.48 Finally, at least four censers from Palestine or Syria display this  type in their cycle of scenes about the life of Christ.49 3. The oldest extant mosaic of the Annunciation, at Santa Maria Mag- giore (fi fth  century, Rome), shows the Spinning, Seated, Face- to- Face type.  Here, like a Roman matron, Mary sits and spins thread that comes up from  a basket next to her (fi g. 5.5).50 Another contemporaneous or possibly  earlier example can be seen on the left side of the “Pignatta” sarcophagus  (fi fth  century, Quadrarco di Braccioforte, Ravenna).51 In this seated An- nunciation type, Mary is sitting on a low stool (not a high- backed chair),  and Gabriel stands facing her, whereas the mosaic example shows Gabriel  fl ying in from above. A gold medallion found in Egypt, probably produced  in Constantinople in the sixth  century, resembles the Pignatta sarcopha- gus example in form, as does another medallion from Adana, a sixth-  century ivory now  housed in Moscow, and at least one Byzantine censer.52  A pilgrimage ampulla, or oil fl ask (Israel Museum), deemphasizes the spin- ning activity and thus serves as a segue to the next Annunciation type.53 </page> <page sequence="13"> Fig. 5.4.

Several examples of the Annunciation show an Ambiguous  Rope- to- Vessel type, which seems to have evolved from the spinning types  (thread- to- basket) but also bears resemblance to some well types below  (rope- to- well). A clear example of this is an amuletic silver armband from  sixth- or seventh- century Egypt, which shows in a locus sanctus (holy site)  cycle a vessel between Gabriel and Mary and a squiggly line coming up from  it (fi g. 5.6, photograph of Annunciation and rollout of entire armband).54  A Syrian pilgrim token shares the form, though it is too small and worn to  know for sure.55 An octagonal marriage ring (sixth to seventh  century, Con- stantinople) from the Walters Art Museum also shows Mary leaning over   toward an ambiguous vessel, while Gabriel points up at a cross or star above  (fi g. 5.7).56 This type is sometimes diffi  cult to distinguish from scenes of  Fig.  5.6.

What is crucial to note about this ambiguous type is that  later in the  iconographic tradition, the rope coming out of a central vessel will evolve  to become the stem of a fl ower coming out of a vase. Recall Mary’s  water  pitcher– cum– fl ower vase in the center of Robert Campin’s famous Annun- ciation. In fact, there are hundreds if not thousands of examples of this  feature; in anthologies of Annunciation scenes, a vase of fl owers or a small  tree is found more often than not next to Mary or in between Mary and  Gabriel.57 Often, it is only a small vase of fl owers in between them, but  many examples show a long lily plant growing up from a vase on the fl oor,  which clearly has been adapted in form from the Ambiguous Rope- to-  Vessel type (e.g., Simone Martini’s altarpiece, 1333, Uffi  zi; fi g. 5.8).58 </page> <page sequence="16"> Fig. 5.8.

Some examples show Mary not in the act of domestic work—  whether drawing  water or spinning— but sitting or standing With Spin- ning Tools, especially the distaff . An accessible example of this type can  be seen in a meticulously preserved reliquary of the true cross from the early  ninth  century (fi g. 5.9).

Other examples pre sent Mary neither at work nor holding her tools,  but instead display a Vestigial Vessel— either a  water pitcher or a thread  basket— nearby. The ivories of the Grado Chair (sixth to seventh  century),  for example, show Mary standing with nothing in her hands, but in the bot- tom corner of the scene rests her basket with distaff  sticking out of it.63 A  seventh- century wall painting in Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome is only par- tially preserved, but the vestigial basket sits similarly on the fl oor by her  feet.64 The eighth- to ninth- century silk from the Sancta Sanctorum in the  Vatican shows Mary’s basket next to her on a side  table, while one type of  Byzantine censer depicts some kind of vessel in between a standing Mary  and Gabriel.65 A variation on this type shows not a vestigial vessel but a  vestigial spring of  water: a carved wooden door from Egypt pre sents Mary  holding a book, but in the background,  behind Gabriel, fl ows a spring of   water, recalling the early tradition.66 Most interest ing for our purposes, though, is the Syriac church of Mar  Musa al- Habashi, whose triumphal arch is surrounded by an Annuncia- tion scene (introduced in chapter 4; fi g. 5.17 below). Though the wall is only  partially preserved, its type shows Mary looking back at Gabriel, with her  left hand outstretched in surprise. Because of damage to the painting, it is  not clear  whether she holds anything in her right hand, but according to  Erica Cruikshank Dodd, who published the paintings, “a  water jug in the  corner indicates that the scene takes place beside a well. The jug is deco- rated with blue and white vine scrolls.”67 It is im por tant to remember that   here, more than eight hundred years  after the paintings at Dura- Europos,  is the next preserved program of church paintings in Syria. And this church  included both a pro cession of torch- bearing virgins and an Annunciation  scene with lines of incarnation and a vestigial  water pitcher. 7. Finally, we turn to Annunciation scenes at a well. Several exam- ples of illuminated manuscripts from Syria and Armenia show the Annun- ciation At the Well, Face- to- Face. One form of this type shows an outdoor   water well stationed between Gabriel and Mary, though Mary stands par- </page> <page sequence="19"> A  Woman at a Well 173 tially inside a doorway, or just in front of a covered throne (examples at the  British Museum and Vatican Library).68 Possibly the oldest version of the  indoor-o utdoor hybrid is a sixth- century ivory pyxis, which seems to show  Mary seated  under an arcade but Gabriel fl ying  toward her over a well.69  Some types are fully outdoors, such as a beautiful example from Midyat in  Tur Abdin (fi g. 5.10; southeast Turkey/northeast Syria, 1226).70 It comes  much  later than Dura- Europos, of course, but is proximate geo graph i cally.  In terms of church paintings, an alleged Annunciation at the well from Pera  Chorio, Cyprus (1160–80) is badly damaged, but those who have seen it  Fig. 5.10.

Mary is usually holding her spinning tools in one  hand, showing surprise with the other, while the well pours forth on its own  into a pitcher, thus off ering a hybrid of the types that emphasize drawing   water and spinning thread. Thomas Mathews argues that this well is “more  than a narrative detail” and that “both well and vessel are common meta- phors of the Blessed Virgin in the hymns of the Armenian church, which  refer to her as the ‘fountain of living  water’ and the ‘golden pitcher.’ ”74 The  stunning illumination of the Annunciation in the Gladzor (Glajor) Gospels  exemplifi es this tradition (fi g. 5.11).75 Here we also see that the Ambiguous  Rope- to- Vessel type in the center has evolved in this regional tradition to  become a tree sprouting directly  behind the central  water well (cf. other  examples from Venice and Jerusalem).76 In the  fourteenth  century, the  paint ers of Glajor began showing not one but two streams of  water fl owing  from the well into a basin or the pitcher itself, “a perfectly gratuitous  detail” in the words of Mathews, and thus quite inviting of an allegorical  interpretation.77 An example from New Julfa, an Armenian enclave in Iran,  shows the two streams fl owing and Mary holding her pitcher in her left  hand.78 Never having accepted the Christological formula of Chalcedon  (451), the Armenian tradition continued to use meta phors of “mixing” to  describe how Christ had both divine and  human natures. The two- spigoted  well pouring into one receptacle (Mary’s womb) was thus an apt pictorial  icon for Armenian Christology. 8. Last, we turn to the type that most formally resembles Mary’s por- trayal at Dura- Europos, if indeed it is Mary depicted there. The At the  Well, Looking Back type is well- attested, but not very early in the extant  materials. One possi ble example from late antiquity is a censer with a unique  Annunciation type, in which Mary’s body is crouched down and looking  </page> <page sequence="21"> Fig. 5.11.

Housed in Tbilisi, Georgia, a clear photo- graph of this scene exists in Ilse Richter- Siebels’s 1990 dissertation, but it  is nonetheless diffi  cult to discern  whether it was intended as a spinning or  drawing  water type (fi g. 5.12).79 The tree growing near the vessel suggests  the outdoors (drawing  water), but there may also be part of a chair show- ing  behind Mary, which would suggest the indoors (spinning).  After this  ambiguous example, the At the Well, Looking Back type is not evidenced   until the eleventh  century and  later. Though coming centuries  later than the art of Dura- Europos, illu- minated manuscript pages of the Annunciation from Byzantine manuscripts  bear arresting formal resemblance to it. Several examples show a solitary  Fig. 5.12. At the Well, Looking Back type of Annunciation. Byzantine censer.  Tbilisi, Georgia.

It was this  image, in fact, that fi rst sparked my interest in revisiting the identifi cation of  the painting from Dura. Versions preserved in both the Vatican Library and  the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris show Mary grasping her rope, which  goes down into the well.81 This iconographic Annunciation type developed  from a tradition of illuminated manuscripts of the life of Mary. The most familiar version of this type is probably that from the well-  touristed San Marco in Venice. The western vault of the northern transept  contains twelfth- century mosaics of the life of the Virgin, and the Annunci- ation type matches those from illuminated manuscripts of the era (fi g. 5.15).82  Perhaps the grandest extant version of this scene is a mosaic from the inner  narthex of the Late Byzantine monastery at Chora in Istanbul.83 As with the  previous examples that feature a fl ying Gabriel, Mary looks over her shoul- der at the angel approaching from above,  here coming from a  diff erent panel  of the artistic program. This female fi gure can be contrasted with the por- trayal of the Samaritan  Woman in the same church, who is looking  toward  Jesus in a posture of dialogue, just as in other iconography of that scene (see  Fig. 5.13.

Finally, the Armenian tradition varies slightly, show- ing Mary standing at a two-s pigoted w ater source, looking back at a stand- ing Gabriel, with her  water pitcher up on her shoulder.84 Looking Again at Dura’s  Woman at a Well With this tour of the morphological variety for the Annunciation fresh in  mind, we return to the most ancient  woman at a well. Most viewers of the  scene at Dura-E uropos see only the features discussed so far: a  woman, a  rope, and a well. However, a close reading of the archaeological report, cou- pled with the photo in situ (see plate 9), reveals other details. Upon in- spection, one can see that the supposed absence  behind the female fi gure  is not totally  silent—it speaks a  couple of lines. That is to say, the painting  at Dura- Europos shows two lines touching the  woman’s back, lines that  grow wider with distance from her body. The lines are diffi  cult (but not  impossible) to see in the photos of the wall in situ; but more importantly,  they are included in one of the drawings in the archaeological report— the  </page> <page sequence="26"> 180 A  Woman at a Well Fig.  5.16. Tracing of   Woman at a well. Christian  building. (Yale University Art Gallery, Dura-  Europos Collection) “new tracing” done in the fi eld specifi cally “to show additional details”  (fi g. 5.16).85 The lines are not depicted, however, in the drawing most com- monly reproduced.86 In Kraeling’s text they are described simply as “un- explained.”87 But with the new interpretation of the female fi gure, in  connection with  later iconography, the lines invite a rather evident mean- ing. They represent a motion  toward the  woman’s body, as if something   were approaching her or entering her—an incarnation. As we have already seen, the iconography of the Annunciation from  the Byzantine era in the East frequently portrayed lines coming from heaven,  often with a dove included as well.88 These lines of incarnation are shown  on the next available church art from Syria—at Mar Musa al- Habashi  (fi g. 5.17)— and in illuminated Syriac manuscripts from that era.89 Virtu- </page> <page sequence="27"> A  Woman at a Well 181 Fig. 5.17. Christ Emmanuel and the Annunciation. The chapel, east pediment  over the triumphal arch. Mar Musa al- Habashi. (Erica Cruikshank Dodd) ally all Armenian illuminated manuscripts portray the lines of incarnation  as well.90 Dodd has concluded that the preponderance of examples of these  lines in Syria and Cyprus (and I would add Armenia) “reinforce the sug- gestion that the motif was rooted in the east” and traveled west  after the  Crusades.91 On the  whole, “before the eleventh  century, painting in the  churches of the Syriac communities in Moslem lands drew upon a  diff erent  tradition from that associated with Constantinople.”92 Reimagining the scene from Dura- Europos as a depiction of Annun- ciation might also help to explain another rarely mentioned aspect of the   woman’s fi gure. On her torso she has a fi ve- pointed star (see fi g. 5.16), which  Kraeling calls “unusual” and “unexplained.”93 He does not off er a com- pelling guess about the star’s symbolism, regardless of  whether the paint- ing represents Rebecca or the Samaritan  woman (the two options he  considers).94 However, with our new interpretation of the scene, this star  may signify the spark of incarnation in the body of the Virgin. Indeed, many  modern icons of the Virgin Mary still show a star on her torso; or consider  </page> <page sequence="28"> 182 A  Woman at a Well Martini’s Annunciation (see fi g. 5.8), which has a small starburst below her  right shoulder, near where the lines of incarnation meet her body. In east- ern Chris tian ity generally speaking, the meta phors of baptism, incarnation,  nativity, and illumination  were often woven together (see more below).95 In conclusion, let us consider the iconography of Rebecca at the well  (very rare), Rachel at the well (very rare), and the Samaritan  woman at the  well (relatively frequent). If my argument aims to refute, or at least unset- tle, the consensus view about this painting from Dura- Europos, it is essen- tial to mention the available artistic evidence for how these other female  fi gures  were depicted. The scene of Rebecca at the well, though not shown  often, does appear in the earliest well- preserved illuminated manuscript—  and that from Syria. The “Vienna Genesis” (early sixth  century) illuminates  the story by showing Rebecca giving a drink to Isaac’s servant Eliezer at a  wellhead, with camels in the foreground and a female personifi cation of the   water source in the background.96 A very early pre sen ta tion of Rachel meet- ing Jacob at a well occurs on the lower panel of the right side of the Brescia  Casket, a late fourth- century box with carved ivory scenes.97 Rachel with  her fl ock meets Jacob at a well with a rope- and- pulley system, and the scene  of Jacob wrestling with the angel is off  to the right. As with Rebecca’s well,   here contextual clues make plain the narrative to which the art refers. Nei- ther scene resembles the  woman at the well from Dura- Europos. Of the extant examples of the Samaritan  Woman, not one that I have  seen looks like the image from Dura- Europos. First, all of them feature a  conversation between the two fi gures: Jesus engages the  woman in a posture  of dialogue. Second, the well is often a “rope- and- pulley” type, as is shown  in ancient examples from the Roman catacombs and the baptistery at San  Giovanni in Fonte, in Naples (fi g. 5.18).98 Or, to take a more proximate  example, the Syriac Rabbula Gospels (586 CE) shows alongside its canon  tables both an Annunciation scene (in a standing spinning or rope- to- vessel  type, Mary separated across the page from Gabriel) and the Samaritan   Woman scene, where she stands next to a well, holding the rope- and-  pulley system, speaking across the well to Jesus.99 The same type of well and  posture, without much variation, is found on many other sixth- century  items: the cover of the St. Lupicin Gospels,100 ivory pyxides,101 a gold  </page> <page sequence="29"> A  Woman at a Well 183 Fig.  5.18.

Jensen) medallion,102 an ivory plaque from Egypt,103 the mosaics at San Apollinare  Nuovo (Ravenna),104 and the chair of Maximian (also in Ravenna, though   here the  woman has her back to the well).105 It is true that some examples  feature a  simple wellhead without pulley system, but all examples show the   woman in a posture of dialogue with Jesus.106 Simply stated, the only artistic  examples of a  woman at a well with distance between her and the other  fi gure— either fl ying in from  behind or above— are those of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage and Ritual Several of the artistic examples above— ampullae, terracotta tokens, and  censers— were able to spread iconography across the Mediterranean world  </page> <page sequence="30"> 184 A  Woman at a Well through the hands of pilgrims. The practice of pilgrimage was so pop u lar  that in the late fourth  century, Gregory of Nyssa penned a letter with sin- gular purpose: to persuade Christians that pilgrimage to the newly   fashionable “Holy Land” was unnecessary—a nd even unholy: “We knew  that [Christ] was made  human through the Virgin— before we saw Bethle- hem; we believed in his resurrection from the dead— before we saw his  memorial- rock; we confessed the truth of his ascension into heaven—  without having seen the Mount of Olives. We benefi ted only this much  from our traveling there, that we came to know by comparison that our own  places are far holier than those abroad. . . .  For the changing of one’s place  does not bring about any greater nearness to God.”107 Not many Christians   were persuaded. Indeed, judging by the extant evidence of the period from the re- founding of Jerusalem by Constantine to the Muslim conquest, pilgrimage  to the Holy Land was a pop u lar enterprise. E. D. Hunt has argued that pil- grimage properly so- called actually existed before Constantine, as evi- denced by Christian travelers in the second and third centuries who attested  some knowledge of sacred topography— a “tradition of the location of key  moments in the scriptural rec ord, albeit only occasionally and dimly  documented.”108 Then, following on the heels of Constantine’s mo ther  Helena’s alleged discovery of the “true cross,” a sense of Christian holiness  radiated outward from Golgotha and permeated Judea and Galilee. Soon,  ascetics from all over  were emigrating to set up hermitages and monaster- ies in this holiest of lands. Growing fl ocks of pilgrims  were not far  behind. The most famous of  these are known by their travel diaries passed down through history: the  “Bordeaux pilgrim,” the “Piacenza pilgrim,” “Peter the Deacon,” and the  preeminent one, “Egeria,” who off ers detailed accounts of Holy Week in  Jerusalem.109 Most do not give reasons for their journeys, but they  were  likely drawn by the allure of religious blessing (eulogia) from both holy  places and holy  people. In the words of Gary Vikan, “For the early Byzan- tine pilgrim, the word eulogia (Latin, benedictio) held special meaning, re- ferring to the blessing received by contact with a holy person, holy place, or  holy object, sometimes realized through the reenactment of the event that  </page> <page sequence="31"> A  Woman at a Well 185 had initially sanctifi ed the locus sanctus.”110 Pilgrims used all their senses  and “sometimes sought blessing through mimesis— action imitative of the  sacred heroes and events along his or her route.”111 A favorite example rec- ords the tradition of throwing stones at the tomb of Goliath.112 Pilgrims returned from their journeys with more than memories.  They brought back iconography and especially reverence for the cross,  which was featured prominently in the ritual encounter orchestrated by the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre.113 Considering how uncommon cruciform  imagery was before the fourth  century, it seems probable that the popular- ity of the cross was the greatest legacy of Helena and the inauguration of  religious tourism to Jerusalem. Some of the wealthier pilgrims brought back  censers that  were adorned with a locus sanctus cycle of at least four and as  many as twelve scenes; the extant examples have been helpfully cata loged  by Ilse Richter- Siebels (see fi g. 5.12).114 The Annunciation is featured on  almost all of them, and it occurs in a variety of types that originated in Pal- estine and Syria. Other common image- bearing souvenirs included oil lamps, ampul- lae, and terracotta tokens, called “seals” or “stamps” (sphragis). The latter  group was similar in concept to the modern souvenir coin from many Amer- ican tourist sites that can be stamped with an image by a machine. The  most well- known group of “image- bearing pilgrim blessings” from the Holy  Land contains fl asks and tokens  housed at Monza and Bobbio in Italy.115  More than forty of the metal fl asks with loca sancta are known, and some  are in very fi ne condition. They often feature veneration of the cross and  tomb, but some of them show a fuller cycle of holy sites. A pewter fl ask  housed in the trea sury of the Cathedral of Saint John  the Baptist (Monza), for example, includes scenes of the annunciation, vis- itation, nativity, baptism, crucifi xion,  women at the tomb, and ascension  (see fi g. 5.4).116 The Virgin Mary features in the top three scenes—in Byz- antine art, she is the orant at the ascension—a nd also the central nativity,  demonstrating her crucial role in the pilgrimage drama. The Annunciation  iconography at the upper left shows the most common Spinning, Looking  Back type, and  here Gabriel points up at the word “Hail!” (ΧΕΡΕ for Χαῖρε).  Other instances of the locus sanctus cycle show the Annunciation as the  </page> <page sequence="32"> 186 A  Woman at a Well Ambiguous Rope- to- Vessel type, with Mary and Gabriel facing one an- other. A sixth- or seventh- century marriage ring shows Mary  either spin- ning from her basket or holding a rope to a well, while Gabriel points above  at a star or dove (see fi g. 5.7). And a sixth- or seventh- century amuletic arm- band from Egypt shows a transitional Annunciation type, in which the  rope- to- vessel is close to losing its rope and becoming a Vestigial Vessel type  (see fi g. 5.6). In all these cases, Vikan argues that the appeal of “mimetic  identifi cation” explains their popularity, and in the case of the armbands,  they “delve explicitly into the world of magic by including images and  phrases other wise familiar from late antique gem amulets and from magi- cal bronze pendants.”117 Because of the heartiness of lead and pewter, the metal ampullae  were  able to stand the test of time much better than the stamped terracotta to- kens; however, the more fragile tokens  were far cheaper and easier to pro- duce, and these  were almost certainly the souvenir choice for most pilgrims,  as seems to have been the case at pop u lar pilgrimage sites of saints. More  than 250 tokens are extant, for example, from the locus sanctus of Simeon  Stylites in Syria.118 And about 100 more of these stamped tokens exist that  feature a biblical or Holy Land scene; those at Bobbio and Monza feature  scenes from none other than the Protevangelium of James.119 The meeting of Mary and Elizabeth, the mo ther of John the Baptist,  is well- known from canonical Luke and included on many locus sanctus cy- cles: the neighborhood of Ein Kerem, west of Jerusalem, remains a pilgrim  destination devoted to John the Baptist and his  family. But a token from  the Bobbio collection includes a scene  diff erent from the typical “Visita- tion” (Luke 1:39–56).120  After the birth of John the Baptist and Jesus, when  Herod seeks to kill all the children two years old and younger (Matt 2:16),  the Protevangelium rec ords a tale not found in the canonical witness: “But  Elizabeth, when she heard that John was sought for, took him and went up  into the hill- country. And she looked around to see where she could hide  him, and there was no hiding place. And Elizabeth groaned aloud and said:  ‘O mountain of God, receive me, a mo ther, with my child.’ For Elizabeth  could not go up further for fear. And immediately the mountain was rent  asunder and received her. And that mountain made a light to gleam for her;  </page> <page sequence="33"> A  Woman at a Well 187 for an angel of the Lord was with them and protected them.”121  Whether  made at Ein Kerem or elsewhere, this token clearly commemorates that event,  its legend promising a “Blessing of the Lord, from the refuge of Saint Eliza- beth.” Mo ther and child are entering into the mountainside on the right, a  soldier pursues them with sword drawn, and an angel looks down from  above. The token promised safety for travelers in general, and  women who   were pregnant or rearing infants perhaps chose these tokens specifi cally. The second token preserved (this one at Monza) shows one of the  earliest images of the At the Spring type of Annunciation (fi g.  5.19).122  Probably acquired by a pilgrim to  either Nazareth or Diocaesarea  (Sepphoris)— and beautifully preserved—it shows Mary bent, drawing   water in her pitcher from a spring near a tree and looking back over her  shoulder at Gabriel fl ying down from above. The angelic greeting “Hail,  full of grace” is printed below his fi gure (ΧΕΡΕ ΚΕΧΑΡΙΤΟΜΗΝΙ for χαῖρε  κεχαριτωμένη), and the blessing encircles the token: “Blessing of the Mo- ther of God, from the rock Boudiam(o?).”123 This token is thus among the  most locative of pilgrimage objects from the Holy Land: it names a specifi c  place commemorated as Mary’s well or spring in probably the sixth  century.  Unfortunately, all attempts to line up “Boudiam” or “Boudiamo” with a  place name in Greek, Hebrew, or Syriac have been in vain.124 Again, the  notion of amulets relating to pregnancy comes to mind, and it is probable  that a token such as this functioned as a prayerful hope for successful con- ception and delivery. In any case, it shows that the Annunciation at a  water  source was among the earliest iconographic traditions, reinforced by the  production of image- bearing tokens for pilgrims to Galilee. Corroboration of pilgrimage to a well or spring in connection to the  Annunciation comes also from the textual tradition. One of the earliest ex- tant pilgrimage narratives was written by a man (often called Antoninus)  from Piacenza (Italy), who visited Palestine about 570. Amid his many fan- tastic details, he rec ords the following about the visit to Sepphoris, which  had by then become associated with Mary’s parents, Joachim and Anne:  “We came to the borders of Galilee, to the city called Diocaesarea [Sep- phoris] in which we adored (as recounted to us) the pail and basket of blessed  Mary. In that place also was the chair where she was sitting when the angel  </page> <page sequence="34"> 188 A  Woman at a Well Fig.  5.19. Pilgrimage token showing At the  Spring type of  Annunciation. Monza. (From  André Grabar, Les Ampoules de Terre Sainte  [Paris:  C. Klincksieck, 1958], pl. XXXI. ©  Klincksieck, Paris 1957) came to her.”125 From this short description, I argue that all three aspects  of Annunciation traditions  were implied by the site: the outdoor trip to the  wellspring (“pail,” amula), the weaving back inside (“basket,” canistellum),  and the sitting indoors during the appearance of Gabriel. Whichever tra- dition a pilgrim had known upon arrival, there was something to see or  touch—it was a full- service, living museum. The Piacenza pilgrim also rec ords his participation in the timeless  tradition of pilgrim graffi  ti, for which he seems to feel ashamed: “Three  miles farther we arrived in Cana, where our Lord was at the wedding, and  we reclined upon his very couch, upon which I, unworthy that I am, wrote  the names of my parents.”126 Indeed, this pilgrim used all of his senses,  touching and tasting more items in the Holy Land than anyone  else  did. Blake Leyerle argues that he was motivated by the hope of receiving  blessings and healing from the many items handled and ingested along his  </page> <page sequence="35"> A  Woman at a Well 189 route: “From his account, the Holy Land emerges as a kind of vast phar- macopia of discrete portable objects. . . .  We perceive the extent to which  the holiness of the Holy Land had pooled into distinct locales, as well as  how the land itself had become charged with religious powers.”127 The  rocks of Mount Carmel  were said to prevent miscarriage, for example, just  as how one imagines a  woman’s visit to the Annunciation sites would call  to mind similar hopes for healthy pregnancy and childbirth.128 But  wasn’t the Piacenza pilgrim’s homage to the Annunciation hap- pening in the wrong city? Current pilgrimage to “Mary’s Well” fi nds its way  to Nazareth, of course, where the ancient wellspring is maintained by  St. Gabriel’s Orthodox Church. A nineteenth- century pilgrim remarked,  “if there be a spot throughout the Holy Land which was more particularly  honoured by the presence of Mary, we may consider this to be the place.”129  The medieval pilgrim Peter the Deacon was probably drawing on Egeria’s  fourth- century text when he wrote that “an altar” was placed in “the cave”  where Mary lived, “from which she drew  water,” while he also rec ords  “the spring from which Holy Mary used to take  water” that was “outside the  village.”130 In between Peter the Deacon and Egeria, there came a Gallic  pilgrim, Arculf, who notes the  water source in about the year 670: in his  narrative he describes two churches, one built to commemorate the spring  and another over the  house to which Gabriel came and addressed Mary.131   Water from the spring is drawn up into the church in vessels by means of  a pulley system, as from a well. Here too, then, the double tradition of the  Protevangelium of James— the well type and the indoor type of Annuncia- tion—is confi rmed by pilgrimage accounts. What is more, the two cities   were promoting their Annunciation sites at the same time: pilgrims to  Sepphoris  were still noting a “well of Mary” or “well of roses” there in the  twelfth and thirteenth centuries.132 In the end, one can draw connections between the ritual experience  of pilgrimage and that of initiation itself. Despite obvious diff erences, both  pilgrimage and initiation involve a “liminal” pro cess, in the words of Vic- tor Turner, during which participants cross a “threshold” (Latin limen) in  search of healing or renewal, temporarily lose the markers of identity from  their previous contexts, have their statuses homogenized with other  </page> <page sequence="36"> 190 A  Woman at a Well participants in “communitas,” and ultimately return with a new “axis  mundi” for their faith.133 Cynthia Hahn concurs and explains the affi  nity  between notions of “sealing” participants in both pilgrimage and ritual:  “The pilgrim is stamped or fi lled with his experience in a way parallel to the  blessing that completes the ritual of baptism, the sealing unto the Lord.”134  Christians received a sphragis at their initiations, one that marked them as  members of a fl ock and impressed upon them the image of their redeemer.  So too did pilgrims become marked or stamped by their experience, and  the blessings conferred thereby  were carried home in ampullae, tokens, and  other eulogiae from the Holy Land. A Christian neophyte was sealed as a  soldier, as a sheep, as a bride, and over time, as a pilgrim. Of Wells and Wombs In the beginning of this chapter I cited the vari ous meetings of  women at  wells in the Hebrew Bible. When Jacob, Isaac, and Moses go to wells, they  each fi nd more than  water— they fi nd wives, mothers for their sons. The  fourth evangelist plays with this tradition in the narration of Jesus’ meet- ing of the Samaritan  woman (John 4). In his article about “genre bending”  in the Gospel of John, Harold Attridge argues that the episode “evokes a  type scene, rich with sexual innuendo, of a patriarch encountering his   future bride,” but “Jesus, who appears initially in the formal position of  the suitor, quickly becomes the one to be courted and sought.”135 When  Jesus meets a  woman at a well, marriage is indeed a topic of discussion,  but erotic desire is nowhere to be found. “A story begins in eros and ends  in mission,” when the  woman becomes an evangelist on behalf of the  Messiah.136 The motif of spiritual marriage from the previous chapter thus  continues into this engagement with a  woman at a well. The third- century  author Origen connects the  woman- well- marriage traditions also to the  ritual of baptism. In his Homilies on Genesis, he writes: “Do you think  it always happens by chance that the patriarchs go to wells and obtain their  marriages at waters? . . .  You see that everywhere the mysteries are in  agreement. You see the patterns of the New and Old Testament to be har- </page> <page sequence="37"> A  Woman at a Well 191 monious. There one comes to the wells and the waters that brides may be  found; and the Church is united to Christ in the bath of  water.”137 The  heirs of the biblical traditions knew that whenever a man and a  woman  met at a  water source, a “bride may be found.” With the strength and longevity of these well traditions, one cannot  overlook the resonances in the tradition of Mary at the  water source. Un- like the Samaritan  woman, her sex life has not (yet) been interrogated; she  is a “pure virgin” of the tribe of David according to sources canonical and  noncanonical. And yet the wellspring is the place of the fi rst announcement  about her pregnancy. Beyond that motif of pregnancy at a wellspring, Syr- ian texts describe Mary’s fruitfulness— her productive  labor— also as a well- spring. In the words of Ephrem, “She is a pure spring which has never  been mingled with the fl ow of marital  union, for she received into her womb  that River of Life which had fl owed down in abundance on creation,  whereby all the dead have come to life.”138 Elsewhere, an anonymous Syr- iac hymn about Mary exalts her above the “ water from the rock” struck by  Moses: “Much more than this rock has the virgin, by giving birth, poured  forth Living Waters— a Fountain from which the thirsty land of humanity  has slaked its thirst; a draft which has fl owed from the  Father at which all  creation rejoices.”139 In a verse homily that rhapsodizes on Mary’s many  symbols, Ephrem alludes again to the “living w ater” of the Gospel of John:  “She is the fountain, whence fl owed living  water for the thirsty.”140 Jacob of Serugh continues the theme in the next  century, styling Mary  in his homilies as the “new well.” She is “the new well from which gushed  forth living  water, and without being hewn out, she generated rushing  streams to the thirsty world.”141 In this allusion to the dialogue with the  Samaritan  woman at Jacob’s well, the author calls to mind several biblical  narratives and recapitulates them through the incarnation of Jesus in  Mary’s womb. The theme of Mary as “new well” was thus “made use of very  extensively in the Syrian Church especially surrounding the feast of nativ- ity.”142 In the  later artistic traditions, one can envision the aforementioned  Annunciation types from Armenia, in which Mary and the angel stand on  two sides of a well. Armenian ritual texts celebrate her as a “fountain of  living  water” and a “golden pitcher.”143 </page> <page sequence="38"> 192 A  Woman at a Well Ritualized Pregnancy and New Birth In the classic exposition of early Syrian Christian theology, Symbols of  Church and Kingdom, Robert Murray identifi es two main aspects of the  church emphasized by Syriac authors: the church as bride and as mo ther.144  The events that correspond to those concepts are, of course, wedding/ marriage and pregnancy/birth. In the previous chapter I explored the  motifs of wedding and marriage in early Syrian ritual and theology, and I  argued for the probability that these formed a dominant symbol in the  artistic and ritual program at Dura- Europos. It remains to be seen how  pregnancy and birth— even incarnation— might also have been imagined  and ritualized in Dura- Europos. As specialists in Syrian Chris tian ity have long demonstrated, “the  Johannine language of rebirth, focused on the image of the womb, is a  central and constantly recurring theme within the Syrian baptismal  tradition. . . .  Womb imagery and the language of regeneration are by no  means lacking in the baptismal theology and liturgies of other churches,  but they do not occupy the same central position that they enjoy in the Syr- ian tradition.”145 In texts such as the Odes of Solomon and the writings of  Aphrahat, Ephrem, and Philoxenos of Mabbug, the feminine Spirit (the  noun is feminine in Semitic languages) corresponds to a maternal womb  in the rites of initiation. Even the death of Christ is brought  under the  aegis of birth imagery, when “Sheol” is imagined as “giving birth” to him  in the resurrection.146 Ritual texts enhance this “birth mysticism” and express it through  both anointing with oil and immersion in  water. As we have seen in the Acts  of Thomas (see chapter 2), the anointing can invoke the Spirit as “mo ther”  over the initiate.147 Simon Jones has used Ephrem’s seventh hymn “on vir- ginity” to draw out the motif. The oil of anointing is “the dear friend of  the Holy Spirit” that has been “sealed” on those in baptism and “is in tra- vail with them in its womb . . .  to replace the image of the former Adam,”  for “baptism is a second womb.”148 These themes appear frequently in  Ephrem’s writings and also feature in  later liturgical scripts. Sebastian  Brock’s editing of the ordines from the Antiochene tradition shows a focus  </page> <page sequence="39"> A  Woman at a Well 193 on the “spiritual womb” in initiation, drawing a special contrast between  the “womb of the  water” and the “womb of Eve.”149 Theodore of Mopsues- tia even refers to postbaptismal garments as “swaddling” clothes, using  language characteristic of physical birth, and some baptismal fonts— though  not yet discovered in Syria— “appear to have been designed to represent a   woman’s vulva.”150 In general, new birth imagery was widespread in an- cient Christian initiation, and specifi cally, the Syrian prebaptismal anoint- ing could “confer upon the candidate the necessary characteristics and  properties so that, on his entering the waters of new birth, the womb might  become impregnated.”151 The missing typological link  here is the womb of Mary, which was  understood to have overturned the corruption of Adam and Eve. Brock has  demonstrated a strong resonance between Syriac ritual texts and the An- nunciation to Mary in the Syriac Bible, since the verb aggen (“overshadow”  or “tabernacle”) describes both the action of the Holy Spirit on Mary’s  womb (Luke 1:35) and the Holy Spirit in Syriac liturgical rites of initiation  and the Eucharist.152 It became a “technical term denoting divine interven- tion” and “a special type of salvifi c activity.”153 For our purposes, it is also  suggestive to note the verb’s etymological connection to gnōnā, the Aramaic/ Syriac word for “bridal chamber” (something “covered over” or “shaded  over,” as with a chuppah).154 Ephrem further demonstrates a link between  the womb of Mary and the ritual of baptism, off ering this Marian speech-  in- character: “The Son of the Most High came and dwelt in me, and I  became his mo ther. As I gave birth to him— his second birth, so too he gave  birth to me a second time. He put on his mo ther’s robe— his body; I put on  his glory.”155 The incarnation thus doubled as Mary’s baptism. As I argued above, the lines  behind the female fi gure in the Dura-  Europos baptistery can be explained by such in-d welling incarnation of  the Spirit; in addition, Syriac texts about Mary help to interpret the star  painted on that fi gure’s chest. Fire or light often manifests the Holy Spirit,  and in the Syriac traditions of the Annunciation and incarnation, such imag- ery sparkles. Ephrem summarizes a general Syrian view: “fi re is the symbol  of the Spirit, it is a type of the Holy Spirit who is mixed in the baptismal   water so that it may be for absolution.”156 In his hymns he specifi cally  </page> <page sequence="40"> 194 A  Woman at a Well connects these themes to the Annunciation. The examples are striking to  many modern readers, since they are so  diff erent from the western tradi- tions: “Fire and Spirit are in the womb of her who bore you, see Fire and  Spirit are in the river in which you  were baptized,” Ephrem sings to  Jesus, and so too, “Fire and Spirit are in our baptismal font,” he says to  Christians.157 Mary would be justifi ably concerned when the “fi ery” angel  delivers the announcement, and a  later Syriac dialogue poem imagines  her response: “You greatly disturb me now, for if, as you say, He is all fl ame,  how will my womb not be harmed at the Fire residing there?”158 For  Ephrem, the combination of fi eriness and wateriness shows forth the par- adox: “It is a source of great amazement . . .  how a Flame dwelt in a moist  womb which did not get burnt up.”159 Beyond the dialogue with the angel, Ephrem also, in his fi nal hymn  for the feast of the Epiphany, constructs a dialogue between Mary and  the Magi, during which they mutually discover that Mary’s angel and the  Magi’s star are manifestations of the same being.160 The angelic voice and the  star are two forms of the same epiphany, that the newly conceived baby is  the anointed Son of God. Here in Dura- Europos, the unseen angel of the  Annunciation may thus be represented in the painting by the manifest star  of incarnation. The same spark of light illumines the night sky, the baptis- mal river Jordan, and the womb of Mary. The opening images of the hymn  “Blessed Is the Creator of Light” describe how “the Light settled in Mary, it  polished her mind, made bright her thought and pure her understanding,  causing her virginity to shine. The river in which he was baptized conceived  him again symbolically; the moist womb of the  water conceived him in  purity . . .  In the pure womb of the river you should recognize the dau gh ter  of man, who conceived having known no man.”161 Uniting many of the afore- mentioned motifs into one hymn, Ephrem connects the light of incarnation  with the waters of the baptismal river and the incarnational womb. Premodern Polysemy Analy sis of early Christian art has often focused on fi nding the right text—  what text does a painting, carving, or symbol represent?162 If correctly iden- </page> <page sequence="41"> A  Woman at a Well 195 tifi ed as a repre sen ta tion of the Annunciation, the painting at Dura- Europos  would be the earliest securely dateable example of that scene. The idea is  exciting and enticing— and might turn New Haven into something of a  Marian pilgrimage site! Yet one must remember that an angel- less icon of the  Annunciation would actually be unique. In all other examples, Gabriel is  pictured somewhere, occupying that empty space in the example from  Dura- Europos. The proposal that Gabriel might have featured in the up- per panel, fl ying in from above, as in  later examples of the type, remains  an argument from silence. The fact also remains that the Samaritan  Woman  features prominently in the early Christian imagination of baptism, though  much more in the West than in Syria.163 Most importantly, I would con- tend that the Protevangelium of James cannot provide the key to unlock- ing the image of Dura- Europos’s  woman at a well any more than the Gospel  of John does. Against the method of Kraeling and many other interpreters  of the baptistery, I usually hesitate to accept proposals of one- to- one cor- respondences between images and texts, as if the paintings  were allegori- cal trea sures that the right biblical text could unlock.164 This  woman at this  well may be polysemic, inviting the neophyte in the ritual space to imag- ine multiple, intertwining texts: the betrothal of Rebecca, the Samaritan   Woman, the Annunciation to Mary. It opens up the viewer to the ideas of  purity, spiritual marriage, incarnation, and new birth. The veil of image,  text, and ritual is spun with multiple threads, and it captures a surplus of  meanings. The ritual context of the paintings in the baptistery further encour- ages polysemic interpretations in most instances. Anthropologist Victor  Turner describes two of the chief properties of dominant ritual symbols to  be “condensation,” by which “many things and actions are represented in  a single formation,” and “a unifi cation of disparate signifi cata,” which are  “interconnected by virtue of their common possession of analogous quali- ties or by association in fact or thought.”165 The pro cession of  women and,  to a lesser degree, the  woman at a well are dominant, polysemic symbols  in this ritual space. Annabel Jane Wharton has argued along similar lines  (as discussed in chapter 1), concluding that some of the paintings in the bap- tistery may not have functioned as one- to- one correspondences to texts.  </page> <page sequence="42"> 196 A  Woman at a Well Ritual- centered viewing and pro cessional visuality can de- center the pri- ority of texts in interpretation. In his book Image and Text in Graeco- Roman Antiquity, Michael  Squire agrees with the polysemic school of thought and defi nes a chief  prob lem with modern western analy sis of ancient art: the critical prob lem . . .  stems from the reductive defi nition of  the image as simply a mode of communication  after the man- ner of words. It is a defi nition that descends from the theology  of Reformed Chris tian ity, with its emphasis on the invisibility  of faith and its faith in invisibility. The Lutheran apologia for  the image viewed pictures as legitimate only in so far as they  could symbolize some external verbal meaning and could be  collapsed into an expression of language. Not only is the image  deemed subservient to text, it is also treated as text—as visual  means to an avisual end.166 Images do not merely “illustrate” texts, nor do texts simply “caption”  images, but Squire identifi es a “transitive exchange . . .  a two- way inter- action,” through which “each medium enlarged the other’s f ield of ref- erence.”167 We have already seen this above in the Gospel illumination of  the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins: the late ancient homiletic  traditions about the text, coupled with prophetic intertexts, became painted  into the art. In ritual- centered viewing, we add the third component of em- bodied, pro cessional, sacred visuality to Squire’s transitive exchange.  Meaning is generated at the nexus of text, art, and ritual. Squire places the blame for our common privileging of text over  image— and both of these over ritual— squarely at the feet of the Reforma- tion, which itself was dependent on the printing press and the concomitant  logocentric revolution. He aphorizes, “One simply could not be a Prot- estant in the Graeco- Roman world.”168 Then if modernist epistemology is  a prob lem to be overcome, is postmodernist epistemology the solution?  Does postmodernity’s rejection of absolutes, grand meta- narratives, and  </page> <page sequence="43"> A  Woman at a Well 197 the myth of detached observers— coupled with its emphasis on context,  contingency, and surplus of meaning— better account for ancient phenom- ena? Most art historians would say so. In terms of hermeneutics, ancients   were closer to postmodernity than modernity, the period that increasingly  seems like the historical anomaly. Context, contingency, and surplus of meaning— even rhetorical  “play” in theological interpretation— are not postmodern fads.169 In the  fourth  century Ephrem himself was a master spinner of polysemic ritual  texts. Consider again the motif of a  woman at a well and see how Ephrem  connects the biblical betrothal scenes to baptism: “At the well Rebecca re- ceived in her ears and hands the jewels. The Spouse of Christ has put on  precious things that are from the  water: on her hand the living Body, and  in her ears the promises.”170 Elsewhere, he interprets the Samaritan  woman  as a virgin, which allows him to connect her with Mary, the archetypal  Virgin. Addressing the Samaritan  woman directly, he sings: “O, to you,   woman in whom I see a won der as great as Mary! For she from within her  womb in Bethlehem brought forth His body as a child, but you by your  mouth made him manifest as an adult in Shechem, the town of His  father’s   house hold. Blessed are you,  woman, who brought forth by your mouth light  for those in darkness.”171 In this ritual text, the spark of incarnation and  the light of evangelization are condensed into one. He continues: “Mary,  the thirsty land in Nazareth, conceived our Lord by her ear. You, too, O   woman thirsting for  water, conceived the Son by your hearing. Blessed are  your ears that drank the source that gave drink to the world. Mary planted  him in the manger, but you [planted him] in the ears of His hearers.”172 Re- becca is a baptized- married bride of Christ, and the Samaritan  woman is a  pregnant virgin like Mary, all of them incarnating the Word. If Ephrem the  Syrian  were to have seen this  woman at a well in Dura- Europos, then, might  he have seen all of these  women at once? With a  woman at a well, as with most of the extant paintings from  Dura- Europos, polysemy makes sense. But in order to destabilize the es- tablished positions about David and Goliath, the pro cession of  women, and  the  woman at the well, my arguments have needed to show forcefully the  </page> <page sequence="44"> 198 A  Woman at a Well cogency of other options. In this par tic u lar case, my role has been to spin  out the threads of Mary’s side of the story— a  viable and possibly prefera- ble interpretation of this  woman at this well. Incarnation as Salvation In my overall interpretation of the artistic and ritual program of the Dura-  Europos baptistery, these Christians emphasized salvation as victory, em- powerment, healing, refreshment, marriage, illumination, and incarnation  more than participation in a ritualized death. In early eastern Chris tian- ity, and especially before a cruciform spirituality began to radiate out from  Jerusalem’s pilgrimage center, salvation was more likely to be conceived of  through “birth mysticism” than “death mysticism.” This is not to under- mine the power of the passion and resurrection accounts, but rather to re- balance the perspective of modern western viewers looking back  after  centuries of cross- centered Chris tian ity. Stephen Shoemaker aptly summa- rizes the historian’s viewpoint: It is through God’s joining Godself to the Creation and to the   human race that both are again made  whole and restored to  God. . . .  Human nature is healed by the Immortal One’s  condescension to unite with the  human race in the Incarnation,  allowing the recreation, the recapitulation, as Irenaeus calls it,  of humankind. . . .  Far more im por tant— and constant—in  Eastern Christian soteriology is the notion of ultimate unifi ca- tion with God that is made possi ble through the act of Incar- nation, rather than any compensation due to the devil or, in the  case of Anselm [centuries  later], the satisfaction of a debt that  God must collect through the suff ering and sacrifi ce of the  Crucifi xion.173 This emphasis on incarnation and nativity— exalted forms of preg- nancy and birth— can lead back to one of the earliest extant examples of  the Annunciation: the famous fi fth- century ivory book cover from the  </page> <page sequence="45"> A  Woman at a Well 199 Milan Cathedral trea sury (see fi g.  5.3). The upper- left panel shows that  paradigmatic example of the At the Spring type of Annunciation. But what  does the upper- right panel show? Gertrud Schiller’s magisterial Iconography  of Christian Art calls it an “unidentifi ed scene.”174 In my view, this scene  is a condensation of Marian symbols and traditions that evokes virginity,  spiritual marriage, and incarnation. This second stage of the Annuncia- tion complements and elaborates on the fi rst Annunciation scene at the  spring. The hermeneutical key is the star above, to which the angel points;  as in the scene of the Magi at the center left, the star signifi es the spark of  miraculous pregnancy in the virgin.175 But instead of placing this second  Annunciation in Mary’s  house, as does the longer redaction of the Prote- vangelium of James, this scene places her in front of the  temple, as in the  reconstructed prior version, in order to call to mind her virginity.176 Both aspects of the Marian paradox— virgin bride and mo ther— were  crucial to the developing traditions about Mary, and this small ivory vi- gnette captures the mystery. The veil of the  temple, which Mary had been  called as a virgin to weave, suggests her consecrated virginity to the viewer.  And yet, the veil is pulled back somewhat. As in paintings from centuries   later, the illumination of incarnation wends its way into seemingly closed  rooms. The  temple becomes for Mary a kind of mystical bridal chamber,  where her vow of virginity is both consummated and productive of new life.  The Gospel of Philip alludes to Mary as a “bridal chamber,” as would  later  liturgical prayers in the Syriac tradition.177 One of those sings: “Blessed and  glorious is the Mo ther of God, the pure Virgin who received the Most High,  the glorious tabernacle of the divinity, the radiant place of the Shekhina  of the Maker of all, the pure  temple of the Word God, the bridal chamber  [beth gnōnā] of the heavenly Bridegroom.”178 Here, Mary’s womb is imag- ined as tabernacle,  temple, and bridal chamber in one. Through the in- carnation as a mo ther and her own baptism as a bride, it is not surprising  that Ephrem channels Mary’s paradox through her voice: “Should I call  you ‘Son,’ or should I call you ‘brother,’ or should it be ‘betrothed,’ or ‘Lord’?  You yourself give your own mo ther second birth from the baptismal  water.”179 The Gospel of Philip also viewed the incarnation in Mary as the mys- tical key for the “bridal chamber” uniting heaven and earth: “How fi tting  </page> <page sequence="46"> 200 A  Woman at a Well it is to speak of a mystery! The parent of the entirety joined with the virgin  who came down, and fi re illuminated him. On that day he revealed the great  bridal bedroom; it was for this purpose that his body came into being. On  that day he came forth from the bridal bedroom as from what is born of a  bridegroom and a bride.”180 The “fi re” of illumination incarnated in the  Virgin, and her womb became a “bridal bedroom,” from which Jesus  emerged as if born from a normal  union. The same text compares the bridal  chamber twice to the “Holy of Holies” of the  temple, and thus the allegory  of the  temple’s open veil—at the crucifi xion— can be interpreted via the nar- rative of the incarnation. The veil was “torn from top to bottom” to show  that “the upper realm was opened for us in the lower realm, so that we might  enter into the hidden realm of truth.”181 Through the incarnation, the up- per/inner realm was opened to  others: the “holy of holies was uncovered.  And the bedroom invites us in.”182 In the canonical witness,  after all, it is  not only Mary who receives God’s “spirit” as in a “ temple,” but all Chris- tians (1 Cor 3:16). Returning then to the signifi cations of this “unidentifi ed”  Marian scene: the star of incarnation fl ickers over the gabled roof of a  templelike bridal chamber, outside of which stands a virgin who herself  became a  temple and bridal chamber. The open veil “invites in” subsequent  initiates to a spiritual marriage and new birth— a marriage and an incarna- tion. Viewed through the lens of these ancient, if unfamiliar, symbols, new  meanings have also emerged for the fi ery bursts over the white structure  on Dura- Europos’s wall, the stars painted in its font’s mythic canopy, and  the spark on Mary’s breast. In the end, these ideas are not  really so foreign to modern Christians:  Christ as the light that illuminates all believers, Christ as the incarnation  continually reborn in the hearts and wombs of the faithful. Despite centu- ries of emphasis on salvation through the cross, Christian tradition has  always maintained an abiding affi  nity for salvation as illumination and in- carnation. The feast of the nativity remains the most pop u lar Christian  holiday in many locales. And it is not only Christ’s incarnation that is  celebrated. Even  today, in contexts not thought of as “mystical” or “eastern”  in spirituality, Christians proclaim and pray for the illumination and incar- nation of God into their very own selves— not in some obscure tome, but in  </page> <page sequence="47"> A  Woman at a Well 201 the heart of a beloved En glish Christmas carol. The singers of Phillips  Brooks’s “O  Little Town of Bethlehem” acclaim the “shining” of “the  everlasting Light.” Despite the “silence” of nativity, in which “no ear may  hear his coming,” “the dark night wakes, the glory breaks,” and “the dear  Christ enters in.” The ancient theme of incarnation as salvation resounds  in the fi nal stanza: O holy child of Bethlehem, Descend to us we pray; Cast out our sin, and enter in: Be born in us  today. It would have been a fi tting hymn in Dura- Europos.  Under a starry roof, at  the darkness of midnight, hearing a voice in the silence— thus proceeded  an initiation and spark of incarnation. “Be born in us  today,” the neophytes  could have said, gazing on the illuminated Mary, mo ther of their church. </page> </plain_text>
