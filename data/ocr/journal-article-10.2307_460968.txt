<plain_text><page sequence="1">RHETORIC AS DRAMA: AN APPROACH TO THE ROMANTIC ODE BY IRENE H. CHAYES DURING the reconsideration of English Romanticism that has been going on for more than a decade, repeated attention has been given to individual poems, to the myths and "systems" of individual poets, to common images and themes, but oddly not to common forms.' One of the most important of these is the ode, in which many of the best known and most often examined Romantic poems were written. Al- though today we have a better understanding of the major Romantic odes as poems, the general notion of the form remains much as it was a gen- eration ago.2 What is obviously needed is a method of reassessment that will go beyond the older exclusive and now inadequate concern with prosody, stanzaic structure, and conformity to classical models. The approach in the present study, which is offered as a tentative beginning, has been suggested in large part by an essay published several years ago by Norman Maclean, who led up to but did not carry his investigations ilnto the Romantic period.3 According to Mac- lean's thesis, in brief, the English ode in the seventeenth century was constructed as a frag- mentary "plot," with the poet's conception em- bodied in an "agent" and his "actions," as in "Alexander's Feast" by Dryden. In the eight- eenth-century ode, on the other hand, the pri- mary emphasis was on the devices of language- allegorical personification, metaphor, static descriptive imagery-as in the odes of Collins and Gray. While it is possible to question Mac- lean's distinction in particular instances, the con- cepts and terminology he borrows in light dis- guise from Aristotle's Poetics have the advantage of making the ode available to critical as well as historical discussion. In the present study, the Poetics will be drawn on more directly but in somewhat different fashion. Modifying Maclean's conception, I have chosen the terms "rhetoric" and "drama" to express a relation between lan- guage and inner structure which makes the Ro- mantic ode as distinctive as its Neoclassical and Preromantic predecessors, at the same time that it carries forward tendencies latent in both. In Maclean's essay the Neoclassical ode is characterized particularly by its rhetoric, which is the type known as "epideictic," or display ora- tory, concerned with praise or censure and di- rected mainly toward a spectator.4 But although it underwent modification, this remained the basic rhetoric of the Preromantic ode, which most typically became an oration delivered in solitude, the more formal and depersonalized as it was the more solitary. In the absence of the sense of a responsive audience, the rhetorical structure tended to unite with the pattern of an unfolding mental process-meditation, moral reflection, reverie, as in Gray's "Ode on a Dis- tant Prospect of Eton College," Joseph Warton's "Ode to Fancy," or Collins' "Ode to Evening." At the third phase, in the Romantic ode, there was a general intensification of effect: a greater subjectivity of tone and emphasis; an increase in the use of apostrophe and rhetorical amplifica- tion; an even closer association of speech with the processes of mind, which correspondingly became more complex; a subtler, more complex, and more central relation between the speaker and the ob- ject of address. It was through the last change, especially, that the ode in the hands of the Ro- mantics ceased to be merely allegorical, didactic, or descriptive, and moved to the level of drama. The term "dramatic lyric" is sometimes used, usually in reference to Metaphysical poetry, and little more may be meant than that poems given such a designation are arresting to read, with unexpected turns of thought and elliptical phras- ing or sudden exclamations that suggest a speak- ing voice. In terms of structure, however-the structure of classic Aristotelian plot-it might be shown that they are "dramatic" in much the same way as an Oedipus Rex or a Hamlet. By now, it is perhaps unnecessary to demonstrate that Plot as discussed in the Poetics is not a mere temporal or causal sequence of events but, as Aristotle's own emphasis in his summary of the Odyssey indicates (Chapter xvii), it is a control- ling structural pattern that unifies through for- mal means and is not confined to the traditional genres of tragedy and epic; in its essentials, it might even be extended to compositions in music or the dance. Plot becomes a uniiversal structural pattern largely through its key parts, Reversal (peripeleia) and Discovery, whi ch are by no 1 In slightly different form, portions of this essay were read before English 9: Wordsworth and His Contemporaries, at the annual MLA convention, Chicago, December, 1961. 2 See G.

As a reversal of intention (from the standpoint of a particular character) or a reversal in the direction of the action (from the standpoint of the specta- tor), peripeteia is not identical with a reversal of fortune or situation, according to Aristotle's prescription for tragedy;' in a "simple" Plot (Chapter x), change of fortune may take place without either peripeteia or Discovery. But in certain Metaphysical lyrics in which there is an intense concentration of effect, reversals of situa- tion, intention, and direction may be fused in one, along with Discovery, the "change from ignorance to knowledge";6 all together, they may constitute the Denouement of the highly con- densed Plot. Donne's "The Canonization," for example, seems to move toward such a Denoue- ment when in the last stanza there is a sudden shift from the lover's defiant monologue to the imagined prayer of the pilgrims. If their advice were followed ("Beg from above / A patterne of your love!"), there would be a reversal in situa- tion, intention, and direction at once, with a double turn of irony: in seeking a "hermitage" in each other, the lovers would actually have been taking an irrevocable step toward leaving human love behind and rising higher to divine love, to become "saints" in fact as well as metaphor. The whole drama takes place in the speech of the lover himself, who arrives at the threshold of his Discovery through the logic of his own conceit. In the Romantic ode, too, a pattern of dramat- ic Plot may develop within a lyric frame, with the speaker playing the role of a protagonist whose "actions" are contained in his words and who is brought to a Reversal or Discovery by what he himself says. Even more than in the Metaphysical lyric, Plot here governs not exter- nal events or relationships but a subjective, inner experience, which may verge on the mystical or visionary but almost always is concerned with a psychological attitude or state of consciousness to which other circumstances are assimilated. Donne in his dramatic lyrics draws on all the resources of language at his command, and pas- sages of rhetoric may share effects with other verbal devices. In the Romantic ode, on the other hand, the primary vehicle of drama is the pecul- iar type of rhetoric inherited from the immediate literary past and represented in the meditative soliloquy, the descriptive encomium, the lyric apostrophe. It is especially the apostrophe, which may be part of meditation or encomium, that brings together an inner state of mind and an external object and makes possible a dramatic confrontation. Plot structure in the Romantic ode is contained in the structure of rhetoric, and the complexity and completeness of the one is bound up with the subtlety and virtuosity of the other. Their concurrence in effect closes the breach between "action" and "image," which Maclean divides between the Neoclassical and Preromantic odes, respectively, for in the evolv- ing rhetorical-dramatic structure, as will be seen, action may grow out of an image and an image in turn may be the end of an action.7 In the discussions that follow, space limitations prohibit the full elaboration of argument and the detailed acknowledgment of previous criticism that would ordinarily be desirable in new read- ings of poems so well known; since the primary concern is with the common form of the ode rather than with the individual poems, perhaps no apology is necessary. The relation of this to other studies of the same odes, as I conceive it, might be expressed in terms borrowed from Aris- totle: dealing with a certain aspect and effect of overall structure or Plot, it is intended to supple- ment, not necessarily to supplant, those which I On these distinctions, see Humphry House, Aristotle's Poetics: A Course of Eight Lectures, rev. Colin Hardie (Lon- don, 1956), pp. 96-97. 6 As House points out (ibid., p. 98), Discovery is not limited to the recognition of objects or persons but "is intended to include the discovery of whole areas of circumstance, whole states of affairs, about which there was previous ignorance or mistake." 7Maclean's colleagues at the University of Chicago have sought to extend or adapt the theoretical concepts of the Poetics to cover the novel and the lyric. (See R. S. Crane, "The Concept of Plot and the Plot of Tom Jones," rev. version, in Critics and Criticism, pp. 616-647; Elder Olson, "An Outline of Poetic Theory," ibid., pp. 546-566.) It should be emphasized that the present study pretends to no such aim. The Aristotelian terms are used here solely in a pragmatic and descriptive sense, in the absence of suitable terms in our own critical vocabulary. My justification is the universality of the structural relations which in the Poetics are dis- cussed with respect to tragedy and epic; the Aristotle called upon is the practical literary critic, not the metaphysician and aesthetician. On the other hand, from an historical standpoint there is the question, which can be only acknowledged here, of how the Romantic ode as I am presenting it may have been related to the changes in the understanding of Aristotelian critical theory that occurred during the eighteenth century. (On such changes concerning the nature of tragedy and the concept of catharsis, see the summary by W. K. Wimsatt, Jr., and Cleanth Brooks, Literary Criticism: A Short History, New York, 1959, pp. 290-292.) Whether the Romantic ode writers in their practice were closer to the critics of the period just past or to Aristotle himself might suggest something of inter- est about the general relation of poetry to literary criticism.</page><page sequence="3">Irene H. Chayes 69 have been written from the standpoint of Thought, Diction, or Character.8 II Coleridge's early verse included a number of odes,9 but it was not until his composition of "Dejection: An Ode" (1802) that the Romantic ode, in the sense in which it is understood in this study, made its appearance. In contrast to the most notable of his earlier odes, "Ode to the Departing Year" (1796) and "France: An Ode" (1798), with their ceremonial invocations and depersonalized, oracular fervor, "Dejection" opens quietly, with a colloquial "Well!" that may remind a modern reader of Donne or Browning, and is anchored in both a concrete, external scene and a specific, subjective state of mind. By way of the key Romantic images of wind and Aeolian harp, which have been well discussed by critics, "outer"' and "inner" are in analogy with each other throughout the poem, balanced in the first stanza, where the speaker's state of mind is an adjunct of the scene he contemplates, and at the conclusion, in which the scene is a backdrop for his state of mind, now changed. In the stanzas between, the two sides of the analogy first are separated, for the account of the loss of "joy," and then in stanza vii are drawn together until for an instant they merge-in another, though visionary, external scene. Although the interest of critics has been mainly in the first six stanzas, from the standpoint of structure it is the seventh that is the most impor- tant-the dramatic turning-point, for which stanzas I through vi have been a preparation, somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian Com- plication. One of the most stable parts of the ode, which was revised only slightly during successive drafts, this is unlike the stanzas preceding it and the one that follows, combining a curious late echo of "sublime" (or so it might seem) with formal rhetorical address. The beginning, in the speaker's own words, is literally an apostrophe, a turning aside: "Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind, / . . . I turn from you, and listen to the wind." The storm foreseen in stanza i has now come on in earnest, and as it increases in intensity it becomes oddly anthropomorphic, divided between a torturer and a victim. The heightened wind "raves," and the Aeolian harp- or "lute," as it is called in this poem-sends forth "a scream / Of agony by torture lengthened out." (So in stanza i the milder wind before the storm was a "dull sobbing draft" which "moaned" as it raked over the strings of the lute.) The human tone continues throughout the long passage of rhetorical amplification that occupies the remainder of the stanza; the lute becomes a series of voices, and the wind that blows over it is personified. The wind alone is addressed by the speaker, and the four successive epithets he uses to characterize it as he ostensibly praises itl" make up a progression which both rhetorically and dramatically is crucially signifi- cant to the situation in the ode. At first, it is simply "thou Wind," a natural force that is out of place in the domestic world of men. "Fitter instruments," says the speaker, would be those belonging to a wild, nonhuman nature, and the images he uses recall the "nat- ural sublime" or the Salvator Rosa picturesque of half a century earlier: crags, trees, a "moun- tain-tairn," a deserted house (11. 100-103).1" In its misdirected fury the wind is seen in the second epithet as a "mad Lutanist," making "Devils' yule" among the frail garden flowers "with worse than wintry song" (11. 104-107). Here it is most hostile, a demonic not merely a natural force, threatening unseasonable death to the reviving spring vegetation-a death like that the speaker already feels in himself through his loss of joy. What is picked up next, however, is not another form of the destructiveness of the wind but the metaphor just used for its threatening activity. As a "lutanist" it is a performer of one kind, and the third epithet, "Thou Actor, perfect in all 8 Recent studies in which the major Romantic odes are analyzed more or less intensively as poems include the fol- lowing: Bernard Blackstone, The Consecrated Urn: An Inter- pretation of Keats in Terms of Growth and Form (London and New York, 1959); Harold Bloom, Shelley's Mythmaking (New Haven, 1959) and The Visionary Company: A Reading of English Romantic Poetry (New York, 1961); Graham Hough, The Romantic Poets, 2nd ed.

"Speaking generally, of the topics common to all rhetorical arguments, amplification is most suitable for epideictic speakers, whose subject is actions which are not disputed, so that all that remains to be done is to attribute beauty and importance to them." The whole passage on amplification might apply equally well to the odes discussed in secs. iII and iv of this study. 11 Cf. Collins, "Ode to Evening," 11. 33-36.</page><page sequence="4">70 Rhetoric as Drama tragic sounds," makes it a performer of another kind,'2 expressing pain rather than inflicting it. From the "tragic sounds" uttered by the actor- wind it is a short step to the creator of the sounds; in its last named role the wind becomes a "mighty Poet, e'en to frenzy bold," yielding in turn in the second half of the stanza (11. 111 ff.) to the genres of poetry itself, products of the inspired creative frenzy, which are known through further imagery of sound and movement. Tragedy is followed in even greater violence by epic: "the rushing of an host in rout, / With groans, of trampled men, with smarting wounds .... . There is a lull, "a pause of deepest silence," and theni the creative sounds are resumed, in a different genre and in the third no longer the second person, as the wind tells a "tale of less affright, / And tempered with delight." In the original verse letter to Sara Hutchinson, it is "William's Self" who "made the tender Lay,"'3 not "Otway's" as in the ode, and the "little child / Upon a lonesome wild" is of course Wordsworth's Lucy Gray, given a dramat- ic voice of her own and sent to join in the general outcry: "And now moans low in bitter grief and fear, / And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear."'14 The screaming lost child brings the stanza to an end on a heightened note, and her emergence from the address to the wind has a double signifi- cance. First, the child replaces the tortured lute as an image for the "soul" of the speaker himself. Through her his soul is "sent abroad" by the commotion of the storm, violently expelled into activity as in the opening stanza he prayed it might be, and in her "grief and fear" she ex- presses the anguish which, on his own complaint earlier in the poem (stanza ii), he has been unable even to feel. Suffering, vocal, and objectified as a child in an external scene, she is almost the exact antithesis of the immobilized, subjective, visual consciousness of the man who speaks in the pre- ceding stanzas. At the same time, the child-image is evoked by a progressive ordering and particu- larization of sensory fragments that amounts to a kind of creation; since she already belongs to a specific poem, she also brings with her the author- ity, and the promiiise, of a work of art successfully executed. The word associated with her story that jars strangely in context, "delight," gives a clue to her function in the poem. In "Kubla Khan," "delight" is an emotional state that is the necessary preliminary to creation; it is to this that the poet hopes to be moved by the song of the Abyssinian maid-who, like the wind in the ode, plays on a stringed instrument. In effect, partly seeking a similar lyric inspiration from without and partly coming on it unexpectedly during his impromptu literary survey, the poet of "Dejection" begins in his reverie to re-compose another man's poem and for the moment becomes a poet again. In both processes of recovery from the state of dejection, the necessary agent is the wind, Coleridge's variant of the pervasive Romantic archetype."5 It brings the regenerating outer and inner storm to "startle this dull pain, and make it move and live," although the speaker is immedi- ately awakened not to joy but to a different kind of pain."6 Also, and more especially, the wind is an impersonal, external embodiment of pure, dynamic energy, both destructive and creative, divine and demonic; by way of the successively humanizing epithets applied to it, it is brought down to the level of the poet and then turned in- ward, becoming a substitute for his blocked creative powers by which he vicariously begins composition again. By the end of the stanza, poet, wind, and lost child have merged into one, summing up a complex process and a crucial inner experience that is the climax of the poem. It is out of the rhetorical progression that the inner experience arises, and since during it the speaker moves from the depths of dejection to the threshold of a revival of his lost creativity, 12 Lines 104-107 have a suggestive parallel in a passage in Jacob Boehme's De Signatura Rerum. Discussing the fall of Adam in terms of a favorite image, also a lute (the usual reference is to the "signature" or form of nature in a passive state, which must be quickened into being by the divine will), Boehme calls the devil a "lutanist" and "the instrument and actor in the wrath of the eternal nature," who as Adam's tempter serves the purpose of God's anger.

His change is not the classic tragic change from good fortune to bad; that has already taken place in the past, with the loss of joy. Although it carries him to the live suffering of terror and not to renewed joy, since it does move outward in a reversal of direction that may lead to a reversal of power upon which intention depends, the visionary reversal of situation is also a dramatic peripe- teia.'7 The effect is essentially anti-tragic, mark- ing a crucial turn in what if it were completed would actually be the pattern of comedy, not in the Aristotelian but in the mediaeval and Chris- tian sense, which within a different set of values was also the Romantic sense. But Reversal does not lead to Denouement; in what remains of the poem, the initial situation is left unresolved. With its sudden drop in tone and shift back to the first person and present reality, the last stanza somewhat parallels the ending of "Ode to the Departing Year," in which apocalyp- tic vision and the rhetoric of denunciation con- clude in catharsis for the speaker."8 Coleridge may actually have had a similar effect in mind for the climax of stanza vii, for "delight," the word that links "Dejection" with "Kubla Khan," also is associated with a version of tragic catharsis that Coleridge undoubtedly knew-AMilton's paraphrase of Aristotle in his preface to Samson Agonistes; "tempered with delight" echoes Mil- ton's own phrasing.'9 But if by stanza viii the speaker's emotions have been both awakened and purged, there is no indication that he has re- gained what has been lost. It is not easy to deter- mine when a Romantic poem on the composition of poetry should itself be taken as the triumphant product of the process that has been described, but I cannot feel that in "Dejection" the speaker "demonstrates the power of imagination in the process of memorializing its failure."20 All that has taken place has been a rehearsal of the way a revival of creativity would, or might, come about; by the time the ode ends, an actual revival is still in the future and hence still in doubt. Even the rehearsal has been vicarious, by way of mem- ories of the work of other poets; in terms of Coleridge's own aesthetic, the faculty at work during the experience of the storm would be not imagination but fancy, a "mode of memory,"' which was the poet's consolation when "all mis- fortunes were but as the stuff / XVhence Fancy made me dreams of happiness" (11. 78-79). The allusion to Lucy Gray, in lines echoing Words- worth's own, and the replacement of Words- worth's name by the more remote Otway's both emphasize that the climactic image itself is bor- rowed. In the closing lines, although he has passed through an enlightening experience and been profoundly stirred at least for the moment out of the lethargy in which he began, the speaker is still immobilized, waiting for the outer storm to end and able to wish an awakening in joy only for another person, the Lady to whom the ode as a whole is addressed.22 III "Ode to the West Wind" (1819) is as distinc- tive among Shelley's odes23 as "Dejection" is among Coleridge's, and the two poems, separated by some seventeen years, are remarkably similar to each other. With the same traditional and Romantic associations as Coleridge's storm-wind, Shelley's West Wind too is a dynamic, destruc- tive, universal force that is ultimately beneficial, both "destroyer" and "preserver." As in "Dejec- tion," the might of the wind is in contrast to human weakness-the weakness of the speaker 17 There was perhaps an adumbration of the dramatic Reversal in the Romantic ode in the "sudden and abrupt transitions always specified as characteristic of Great Odes" in the Neoclassical period; see Maclean, Critics and Criti- cism, p. 435. 18 Now I recentre my immortal mind In the deep Sabbath of meek self-content; Cleans'd from the vaporous passions that bedim God's Image, sister of the Seraphim. (11. 158-161) In a revision of 1803, 1. 160 became the more specific "Cleans'd from bedimming Fear, and Anguish weak and blind" (Complete Poetical Works, i, 168). 19 "Tragedy ... therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated." To my knowl- edge, no one previously has called attention to this important parallel. Ll. 594-596 of Samson Agonistes, which have a verbal echo in stanza iII of the ode ("My genial spirits fail") are quoted in a 1797 letter to Joseph Cottle (Collected Letters, i, 319). A notebook entry for March-April 1802 (Notebooks, I, 1155) indicates Coleridge had been at least thinking about Milton's poem shortly before writing the first version of "Dejection."

House points out (Coleridge, pp. 134-135) that in the original letter version of the ode the passage on the loss of imagination follows rather than precedes what was later to be stanza vii, and the full account of joy is given at the end of the poem in reference to the joy of Sara, instead of being divided between stanzas v and viii. In his revisions, Coleridge both heightened the contrast of states of mind and altered the effects of the wind storm, turning self-analysis into drama. 13 See summary by Shuster, pp. 259-262.</page><page sequence="6">72 Rhetoric as Drama himself, who is a poet contemplating the ideal poetic powers from a subjective situation the very opposite of ideal.24 The extreme negative state that must be transcended here is not only spiritual death, despair, but actual physical death as well. The West Wind is the wind of autumn and death, and the ground metaphor of the ode, introduced in stanza i, is one that is constant in Shelley's poetry, so fundamental to his way of thinking that "metaphor" is an inadequate name for it: the working out of the seasonal cycle in nature as a continuing process of universal death and regeneration. The problem here is a more urgent version of that posed in Alastor and Adonais, as well as in "Stanzas Writ- ten in Dejection": what is the place of humanity in the grand cosmic order? If, as the familiar Shelleyan imagery implies, there is an analogy between the processes of nature and the life of man, how can the analogy be completed to save man too from extinction at physical death? The answer in "Ode to the West Wind," like Cole- ridge's approach to a resolution of the situation in "Dejection," takes the form of a dramatic recovery and reversal by way of a pattern of rhetoric. The whole poem is a single, sustained apos- trophe, which begins abruptly, without preamble or descriptive frame, is spoken directly by the poet, and throughout its interwoven tercets keeps the object of address always in the fore- ground. The first three stanzas are devoted to a formal invocation, in which the wind is charac- terized, and praised, in its role of destroyer and preserver in nature by its effects on the land vegetation, the sky, and the sea.25 In stanza iv, the speaker begins what he himself calls a prayer (1. 52), and in the course of this he uses a series of parallel imperatives that make up a progression as significant and dramatically functional as the epithets in stanza vii of "Dejection." Although each is a rhetorical command, or appeal, to the wind, amplifying its power in relation to the man addressing it, the speaker is also expressing his feelings about himself as a human being facing extinction of identity and as a Romantic poet- prophet facing frustration and defeat in his heroically conceived vocation. At first, in the "sore need" out of which he begins to speak, his wish is only to surrender to the wind's superior force, like the nonhuman objects named in the invocation: "Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!" Confessing exhaustion, pain, oppression, despair (11. 54-56), he in effect accepts death in this stanza, like the Poet at the edge of the precipice in Alastor (11. 625 ff.). The elegiac last line assimilates the man to the wind, "One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud," but by way of qualities which humanize the wind as well. The second imperative, "Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is," opens stanza v with a reminder of another archetypal image Shelley shares with Coleridge, which for Shelley usually represents the mind in its passive, receptive func- tions, or the transience of human life itself.2" The West Wind, like its counterpart in "Dejection," is conceived now as a performer, transforming man and nature alike into its own kind of art. Like the forest with its falling leaves, the speaker dying is prepared to become part of the wind's "mighty harmonies," adding "a deep, autumnal tone, / Sweet though in sadness" to its "tumult" (11. 58-61). On the basis of these lines, especially, some critics have too readily assumed that the remainder of the ode merely intensifies an identi- fication between the poet and nature. For in- stance: "This identification represents, so to speak, the unity which the poem is to win from variety. The individual is to be merged with the general; Shelley [sic] is to become the instrument through which speaks the universal voice."27 But such an interpretation overlooks the abrupt change in tone and attitude in the third impera- tive, which follows immediately (11. 61-62) and for the first time is an outright command: "Be thou, Spirit fierce, / My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!" This is by no means an identifi- cation by the speaker with the wind in which he loses his individual identity; he does not say "Let me be thee," as he would necessarily be saying if the "individual" here were indeed being "merged with the general." Like Coleridge in stanza vii of "Dejection," Shelley in the remainder of stanza v draws to- gether and fuses the two sides of the analogy that 24 Shelley's own note describing the setting in which the ode was "conceived and chiefly written" (Prometheus Un- bound, ... With Other Poems, London, 1820, p. 188) includes wind and a sunset storm like those in "Dejection." On the beginning state of mind, cf. "Stanzas Written in Dejection, Near Naples" (1818), esp. 11. 19-27. '5 Contrasting the Neoclassical and Romantic odes with respect to their rhetoric, Maclean observes (Critics and Criti- cism, p. 434) that the famous odes by Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats "are not artistic constructions designed to the end of amplifying the wonders, respectively, of immortality, wind, and nightingales." Yet to say that "Ode to the West Wind," like stanza vii of "Dejection," is first of all an en- comium of wind in the fullness of its natural and symbolic meanings is to make possible all else that may be said about it. On the nightingale, see sec. iv below. 26 Cf. "A Defence of Poetry," in Shelley's Prose, Or, The Trumpet of a Prophecy, ed. D. L. Clark (Albuquerque, N.

Chayes 73 has been developing in the invocation and the first two imperatives to the wind. The image of the fallen leaves, reintroduced in the reference to the forest (l. 58), has in Shelley a continuing association with death, not only because the leaves mark the end of a seasonal cycle but also because they can be picked up and scattered to dissolution by the destroyer wind.28 In stanza i of the ode the leaves are "pestilence-stricken multi- tudes," driven before the wind "like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing," and in the fourth impera- tive of the later sequence (11. 63-64) "withered leaves" becomes an explicit simile for the speaker's "dead thoughts," which he commands the wind to "drive" over the universe. But the whole line includes an additional idea: the "dead thoughts" are to "quicken a new birth," and this brings them also into correspondence with the "winged seeds" which in stanza i are carried by the wind to "their dark wintry bed" (l. 6) to await the coming of spring. The speaker's "words," which the wind next is commanded to "scatter" (11. 65-67), are compared in turn to "ashes and sparks"-a new image that is directly analogous to the dead leaves and winged seeds, juxtaposing end and beginning, death and re- birth, in a relation about to be affirmed for the speaker and mankind in general as well as for physical nature. In the closing lines of stanza v, the rhetorical and dramatic patterns produce a new shift. The verbs in lines 63-67, "drive" and "scatter," are still transitive, like the earlier "lift me," "make me," of the speaker's stages of weakness. Both his "thoughts" and his "words," like the lyre of the first tercet, are to be acted upon by the wind, although with a different result. At the same time, the wind is subtly reduced in power by the command that it "scatter" the poet's words, for the medium is to be the poet's own art: "by the incantation of this verse" (l. 65). In the sixth and last command of the sequence the intrusive construction of "Be thou me," which appeared between the "lyre" and "thoughts" passages, returns to mark at once the rhetorical climax of the poem and the dramatic Reversal. In stanza I, a "clarion" was to be blown by the wind of re- birth in springtime to rouse the buried seeds (11. 9-12). At the conclusion of the last stanza, we find that the autumn wind itself (not the poet) is to be the instrument of awakening, and the speaker, the man who a few lines earlier sought to be a passive lyre, is the one who will sound its call: "Be through my lips to unawakened earth / The trumpet of a prophecy!" He does not "be- come the instrument through which speaks the universal voice," for his is the voice that speaks.29 The rhetorical-dramatic progression in Shel- ley's ode, then, ends in a total inversion of the original relation between the speaker and the West Wind. As in "Dejection" but less equiv- ocally, a downward reversal of condition, or "fortune," in the past is followed by an upward reversal in direction and intention, which negates the first. The man rises from his state of prostrate surrender to join himself to the force of the wind, master it-fulfilling his boyhood ambition to "outstrip" it (11. 50-51)-and turn it into an instrument of his own. Passive becomes active and active, passive; agent and medium, per- former and performed upon, change places. The "destroyer" becomes the "preserver" by serving as the means to prophecy, and the liberating prophecy itself is both made possible by and con- tained in "the incantation of this verse," which is to say this verse, or "Ode to the West WVind."'0 Here process and product are identical, as they are not quite in "Dejection," and the composi- tion of the ode is necessary to the resolution of the speaker's situation, which is completed with the formulation of the prophecy. The actual prophecy, when it is finally given in the last line, sums up the Discovery, which the poet has been demonstrating dramatically in the course of the poem. Still addressed to the wind, which has now become a human power as well, it confirms the analogy that has been explored in the imagery of leaves and seeds, thoughts and words, by turning from both man and nature to the seasonal cycle that includes both: "O Wind, / If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?" If the force of the triumphant enthymeme is somewhat weakened by its being cast in the form of a question, the only one in the ode,3' this too has a dramatic function, I think. By his uncertainty at the moment he is affirming his victory over his own weakness and despair, the speaker is indicating that he is about to cross the metaphysical bound- ary line, represented in Alastor by the precipice on which the Poet dies, between the individual 28 Cf. Alastor, 11. 583-586. 29 Here I am in disagreement also with the special interpre- tation of Bloom, Shelley's Mythmaking, pp. 87, 89-90. The progression from leaves to seeds and thoughts to words, con- cluding in a vocal utterance, has a justification in the tradi- tion of prophecy; cf. Aeneid vi.74-76, in which Aeneas prays the Cumaean Sibyl to chant her verses instead of committing them to leaves which may be disordered by the winds. 'O As an "incantation," the poem itself replaces the "enchanter" wind saluted in the opening (1. 3). 31 In an early draft the line was declarative: "When Winter comes Spring lags not far behind." (See Verse and Prose from the Manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. Sir J. C. E. Shel- ley-Rolls and Roger Ingpen, priv. print., London, 1934, p. 58.) Cf. The Revolt of Islam ix.xxv.3685-3689.</page><page sequence="8">74 Rhetoric as Drama and universal phases of existence as Shelley con- ceived it. In "Dejection," the burden of act is placed on the ambiguous power embodied in the storm- wind; in "Ode to the West Wind," it is assumed by the speaker himself, although he starts from an even lower point than Coleridge's poet. If in "Dejection" the wind descends, or is brought down, to the level of the human, in Shelley's ode the man raises himself to a level above both the human and the mundane natural. The redeeming energy that comes in vision to Coleridge's poet is perhaps closest to the power of divine wrath, momentarily transformed and transferred to the visionary and paving the way for the operation of the human imagination. For Shelley, on the other hand, what is needed in the final extremity is the force of the moral and creative will,32 the human becoming divine, to enable the products of the imagination to survive and do their work, through which the poet himself will be reborn. In their central addresses to the symbolic winds, both odes are prayers; but rather than "secular- ized versions of an older devotional poetry, em- ployed in the examination of the soul's condition as it approaches and retreats from God,"33 I find them passionate supplications for deliverance, uttered out of the depths of spiritual crises that are not the less profound because they are con- cerned directly with the activity and functions of the artist. Like the petitioner in Donne's Holy Sonnet, "Batter my heart, three person'd God," Coleridge's poet requires salvation by assault; Shelley's in his own word "strives" with his un- equal antagonist, like Jacob of the Old Testa- ment or like the Victorian Jacob in Gerard Man- ley Hopkins' "Carrion Comfort." In both in- stances, the prayer becomes the occasion of an experience very close to mystical, but only in "Ode to the West Wind" does it have an out- come in its own terms-nothing less than a resur- rection of and through the poetic word. IV The odes of Keats written in the spring and autumn of 1819 have received relatively more critical attention than other Romantic odes, and in them at least a general dramatic quality has been recognized.34 "Ode to a Nightingale," the most complex and next to "Ode on a Grecian Urn" the most frequently discussed, is a close companion to "Dejection" and "Ode to the West Wind" in the fullness of its rhetorical-dramatic structure. The beginning situation is schemati- cally much the same as in the other two odes: the speaker in a state of passive reverie, addressing the nightingale (which like the wind is an arche- typal image) as an embodiment of the transcend- ent qualities he lacks. The relation between man and bird here might have developed in much the same way as the relation between man and wind in Coleridge and Shelley; but instead, it follows an erratic course that reflects the changing feel- ings of the speaker and the rise and fall of his inner "actions." No dialectical interaction, even no actual meeting of the two, ever occurs. In stanza i, succumbing to a "drowsy numbness" as he listens to the singing of the nightingale, he be- gins with a confident assertion of empathic iden- tification ("too happy in thy happiness"); in the last stanza, he is totally separated from the bird and its song and in effect dismisses both. Be- tween the first stanza and the last, there is a double Reversal, not upward but downward, ac- companied in each instance by a Discovery and preceded by a passage of ascending rhetoric that culminates in a visionary image. It is this pat- tern, symmetrically divided between the first and second halves of the ode, that constitutes its Plot. After the descriptive statement of stanza i, stanzas ii and iii and most of iv are given over to a series of wishes which with their insistent parallelism and mounting periodic structure take the form of an oration delivered to and about the nightingale: "O, for a draught of vintage"; "Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget"; "Away! away! for I will fly to thee." At the same time, through its obvious relation to the famous dis- course on happiness in Endymion (I.777 ff.),35 this passage of some twenty-five lines outlines a pattern of action the speaker is trying to follow. What Endymion is describing in his speech is both a scale of measurement, "a kind of Pleasure Thermometer," as Keats himself called it,36 and a 32Cf., in slightly different terms, M. T. Wilson, Shelley's Later Poetry: A Study of His Prophetic Imagination (New York, 1959), p. 299. 33 Abrams, English Romantic Poets, p. 48. 4 See W. J.

In the last named study (p. 9), "dramatic principle" is taken to be "the objective playing- out of the clash of oppositions." 36 Cf. i.826-834, in which a singing nightingale is a simile for the yearning lover.

H. E. Rollins (Cambridge, Mass., 1958), i, 218. Keats adds that the passage in Endymion "is my first Step towards the chief Attempt in the Drama-the playing of different Natures with Joy and Sorrow." The last phrase might well be a characterization of the 1819 odes.</page><page sequence="9">Irene H. Chayes 75 process, an ideal, step-by-step ascent to a su- preme degree of happiness by way of specific pleasures of increasing intensity. In "Ode to a Nightingale," the two divisions of the happiness- making process, each of which leads to its own feeling of "oneness," are translated into the two ways by which the speaker believes he can change his condition in alliance with the nightingale. In stanza ii, he calls for a "draught of vintage," not as an end in itself but as part of a complex series of mediations. Through the effects of sensory pleasure belonging to the lower reaches of the ladder of intensity, he wishes to vanish with the nightingale "into the forest dim" and thus (stanza iII) escape the "weariness, the fever, and the fret" of ordinary mortal life. In stanza iv, the mediation is simpler and the end appears to be positive pleasure, not mere escape from pain: the man seeks to rise "on the viewless wings of Poesy" to join the nightingale in a celestial scene which, by its reminder of Endymion's dreams of flight to the moon-goddess, evokes the "richer entanglements" of pleasure through love at the top of the scale. More than one critic has pointed out that the meaning the nightingale has for the speaker changes as the ode advances. The bird is present in both scenes of wish-fulfillment because what it symbolizes by its song at this point in the poem is precisely happiness-not its own "happy lot," which the speaker in the first stanza explicitly says he does not "envy," but the essence (or "finer tone") of happiness, the pure distillation of particular experiences of intense pleasure such as those he is trying to call up out of his own longing. Like the dreams of Endymion, this man's wishes are efforts at attainment. The "Poesy" he uses in his second effort is at a further remove from direct experience than the "draught of vintage," although it is less far removed from the ultimate object; it functions as Keats's version of poetic "incantation," a birdlike vehicle in its own right, carrying the aspirant in vision to within reach of the state of happiness the nightingale embodies: Already with thee! tender is the night, And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays. (11. 35-37) These lines mark the highest point to which the upward movement in the first half of the ode rises. Before the stanza is finished, in the very next line, the first Reversal occurs, suddenly changing the direction of the meditation and coinciding in classic Aristotelian manner with the first Discovery: "But here there is no light." At the height of his vision of transcendence, the speaker becomes aware of his actual position, which is in darkness, deep among "verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways." In effect, he undergoes one of the abrupt falls that appear in Keats's narrative poetry, as when Endymion is overpowered by sleep in a dream embrace with Cynthia (i.672 ff.), or the Knight at Arms in "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" is evicted from the "elfin grot" and wakes "on the cold hill's side." The point to which Keats's protagonist de- scends in stanza iv is lower than that at which he began in the first stanza, and he must grope his way back out of the darkness ("I cannot see what flowers are at my feet") by way of its "em- balmed" fragrances, the elemental stimuli of sense that come to him from the natural world (stanza v). In effect, the ode starts over in stanza vi as the speaker, listening once more to the song of the nightingale, reconsiders his own situation and now acknowledges a longing for death, the logical extension of his "drowsy numbness" of stanza i. Yet fulfillment would place him out of reach of the song with which he originally identi- fied himself: "Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain-/ To thy high requiem become a sod" (]1. 49-50).37 This is the first step toward the major Discovery in the ode, which is to come shortly. Imagining his own death and becoming aware of the unbridgeable distance between the bird and himself, the speaker in the next stanza is able to contemplate the nightingale for the first time in its own peculiar, "immortal" nature, which begins to acquire a new significance. Stanza vii is an apostrophe ("Thou wast not born for Death, immortal Bird!"), characterizing the nightingale and its song in a series of rela- tively direct statements. Although the tone is muted and the rhetoric simpler than in the first four stanzas, there is a rising progression here as in the apostrophes to the wind in "Dejection" and "Ode to the West Wind"-but with a totally opposite effect on the relation between the speaker and the object of address. The nightin- gale does not share the vulnerability and tran- sience of human beings: "No hungry generations tread thee down." Its voice is ageless and uni- versal, "heard / In ancient days by emperor and clown"; perhaps the "self-same song" the man is listening to once found its way to the Biblical Ruth-a figure of legend and hence from another realm than human history, which the nightingale nevertheless was able to reach. From having been in the first half of the ode merely an embodiment 17 On the death motif in this ode, see esp. Wasserman, Tke Finer Tone, pp. 193-197, and Pettet, On the Poetry of Keats, pp. 266-274.</page><page sequence="10">76 Rhetoric as Drama of the speaker's desire for transcendence, the nightingale has gone on to assume an increasingly dynamic and ineffable character of its own as the speaker tries to define with increasing precision the ways in which it was "not born for death."38 The climax of the address comes with the exten- sion of the power of the bird's song beyond the limits of ordinary conceptions of reality and ordinary human experience: The same that oft-times hath Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. (11. 68-70) The opening casement is Keats's image for the apocalyptic moment in Romantic poetry when all barriers and constrictions suddenly fall away, as in Blake's The Four Zoas, when with the end- ing of the Last Judgment "The Expanding Eyes of Man behold the depths of wondrous worlds" (ix.830), or the many experiences of insight and liberation in Wordsworth. Such a moment comes at the conclusion of "Ode to the West Wind" with the elevation of the poet into the universe at large as master over the force of the wind, and the famous closing lines of stanza vii of Keats's ode seem about to offer a delayed fulfillment of the yearnings that were frustrated in the earlier stanzas. The possibility of an apotheosizing flight, outward if not upward, is latent in Keats's imagery in this poem and others. The fancy, named later (stanza viii) as the presiding faculty in the encounter with the nightingale, is shown elsewhere as "winged," ready to "dart forth and cloudward soar" when the "mind's cage-door" is opened.39 But in the ode no such flight occurs. Again, as in stanza iv, a rhetorical and descriptive climax is followed immediately by a Discovery and a downward Reversal, which now decisively complete the separation of the speaker from the nightingale. At the first Re- versal, the man surrendered, or was unable to bring to consummation, an illusory vision that had its origins in longings of his own; at the second, more truly a reversal of intention, he retreats from the view of a totally unknown world, "perilous" and "forlorn," which his new understanding of the nightingale, and his own rhetoric, have opened before him. At the beginning of stanza viii, the second Reversal is marked in almost Metaphysical fashion by the double reference of one word: "Forlorn! the very word is like a bell / To toll me back from thee to my sole self!" Although the verbal ambiguity here has been noticed readily enough by critics, it has not always been recog- nized how much ambiguity and actual irony the crucial word sums up. The "faery lands"-the true world of immortality, to which the magic of the nightingale's song can open a passage more effectively than its early substitute "Poesy"-are seen as "forlorn," desolate and alien in their radical difference from the world of mortality the speaker knows, has sought to escape, and is now accepting. At the same time, he is "forlorn" in his own lonely, mortal nature which he has been un- able to transcend-by the combination of in- voluntary failure and voluntary choice an exile, like Ruth "sick for home." Longing for happi- ness, he has found himself longing for death; turning away from death, he has turned away from immortality; farthest from the state of the nightingale, he is finally closest to it, identified with it by way of a word. (There is a similar am- biguity in "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," turn- ing on an adjective and an adverb. The Knight at Arms is startled out of his dream, which takes place in a realm beyond the human, by the sight of the "pale" Kings and Princes who have been bewitched; yet when he wakes in his own world he is equally desolate, "Alone and palely loiter- ing.") Failure and choice, error and insight, are all bound up together in the relation of the speaker in the ode to the nightingale, as they are in the relation of Endymion to Cynthia or the Knight at Arms to La Belle Dame Sans Merci; ambiguity and irony hover over all three. Unlike the other two poems, however, and in keeping with the demands of the ode form, "Ode to a Nightingale" gives no point of view but the speaker's own; there is no observer, as in "La Belle Dame," to report the immediate effect of his flight from the vision of the "faery lands," and no subsequent narrative, as in Endymion, to show the ultimate consequences. In place of a resolution, there is a formal rounding-off of the situation, much as in "Dejection," with possibly a similar hint of relief after an intense inner experience. In the remainder of the ode, the speaker does not pause at his own forlornness but quickly moves out of the reverie he entered with the opening line of stanza i. Having tried to rise, fallen, and then retreated, accepting the limita- tion of his human powers he now pronounces a combined farewell and dismissal: 38 Cf. the ode "Bards of Passion and of Mirth," 11. 17-22. 39 "Fancy," ll. 5-8. The presence of fancy is another link with "Dejection." If the fancy flies out of confinement when a passage is opened for it, and the song of the nightingale has the power to open such a passage, "charming" the "magic casements," is the nightingale in its climactic role a symbol of the Romantic imagination?</page><page sequence="11">Irene H. Chayes 77 Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf. Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades. (11. 73-75) The placing and repetition of "adieu" make it apply to both fancy and the nightingale's song, which by implication now are assimilated to each other, although by the logic of the earlier stanzas they would be distinct, as means and end or agency and product; both are degraded. The fancy, whose "feigning" elsewhere ("Fancy," "Ode to Psyche") provides minor but legitimate pleasure, here only "cheats" and does so ineptly. The song is sentenced to the vanishing and sink- ing actions longed for or undergone by the man in the first half of the ode: it "fades" into the land- scape and finally is "buried deep / In the next valley-glades," out of his hearing. As the nightin- gale and its song disappear from the poem, the speaker turns from the events just past, from both change of intention and change from ignor- ance to knowledge, to the nature of the whole experience that is ending, and like his counterpart in "Ode to the West Wind" concludes with a rhe- torical question: "Was it a vision, or a waking dream? / . .. Do I wake or sleep?" "Dejection" and "Ode to the West Wind" also end on a note of uncertainty, as has been seen; yet even here Keats achieves an effect of his own. An answer to the question that ends the "Night- ingale" ode would be found not in a future that has been provided for in the text, like Shelley's spring or Coleridge's morning after the storm, but on a different level outside the poem, where the speaker would be more significant than his ques- tion and could be judged as a dramatic personage in his own right, one who has been revealed by his speech and actions, like the first-person pro- tagonist in a dramatic monologue by Browning. In the terms of the Poetics, the chief aspect of drama in "Ode to a Nightingale" finally is not Plot, in spite of the complex pattern of Reversal and Discovery, but Character (ethos), "that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of things a man chooses or avoids." V In other major Romantic odes, which means largely other odes by Keats, there are varying adumbrations of the rhetorical-dramatic struc- ture that has been traced in "Dejection," "Ode to the West Wind," and "Ode to a Nightingale." The critical inner balance tends to be upset, usually on the side of rhetoric again, as in the Preromantic ode; Plot often is reduced to Epi- sode and subordinated to Thought; when a reso- lution is approached, it is more likely to be by way of Discovery than Reversal.40 "Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recol- lections of Early Childhood," which in many respects is Wordsworth's "Dejection,"4' uses the distinctive Wordsworthian rhetoric almost as a persona, a third voice which reconciles the Blakean and Neoplatonic voices of the first half of the poem and as his "song of thanks and praise" becomes the medium for the moral reso- lution of the speaker's dilemma. The turning- point in this ode comes, once again, at the climax of a rhetorical apostrophe (stanza viii) as the speaker, addressing the Child, finds release for his own grief. (This passage, incidentally, combines both types of epideictic rhetoric: the Child is praised in his present state of "blessedness" and reproached for his grown-up games which would put an end to it.) Keats's "Ode on Melancholy," a drama of attempted recovery that fails, com- presses a miniature tragic Plot into three short stanzas. An upward Reversal, approached through the cultivation of sensory pleasure as a remedy for suicidal despair, is followed by a Re- versal downward, as pleasure itself turns to sor- row. The Thought of the ode is contained in the Discovery, by which the second Reversal is made known: "She dwells with Beauty-Beauty that must die," etc. Keats's dramatic pattern here outweighs his rhetoric in importance, as rhetoric outweighs drama in the "Immortality" ode; yet in both odes a defining relationship between speaker and object is absent. Wordsworth's speaker addresses himself to several objects in turn; but these, including the Child, gain their significance from the successive stages of the ex- perience and his inner moral evolution to which they belong, they do not determine the direction he takes. Speaking in his third voice almost as an oracle of the events in his own consciousness, he is closer to the deaf soliloquists of the Preromantic ode than to Coleridge's and Shelley's dramatic petitioners. Keats's speaker, in turn, addresses only what is presumably another aspect of him- 40 In Byron's ode "On This Day I Complete My Thirty- Sixth Year," there is a shift (from sorrow in rejected love to a resolution to act) which is rhetorical without being dra- matic, unaffected by anything that happens within the poem. This and others by Byron (summarized by Shuster, pp. 255-257) belong among the minor odes of the period. The difference between major and minor Romantic odes, wbich can be seen even in the work of the same poet, is a separate problem, more suitably considered as part of the overall history of the ode. 41 Not, I think, really an answer to it. Wordworth too echoes the Poetics, however indirectly, in the passage on "imitation" (11. 102-107).</page><page sequence="12">78 Rhetoric as Drama self, or a distant, general audience. Personified as a veiled goddess, perhaps a statue, who can be seen only by her victims, Melancholy herself is not an antagonist, an object of longing, or a pre- siding genius who in some way influences what is said and done by the person speaking, but a destination to which all his actions, taken in rela- tion to other objects, inevitably lead. On a lower level than "Ode to a Nightingale," "Ode on Indolence" is centered around an un- successful encounter in which failure and choice are mixed in another great refusal, and dramatic relevance is almost exclusively in Character. Al- though on three occasions he is visited by Love, Ambition, and Poesy, personifications of the great life incentives of the Romantic poet, whom he addresses, the speaker cannot be stirred out of his drowsing "summer-indolence" to activity of any kind. The model relation between speaker and object is inverted: he does not seek but is sought; he does not know his visitors when they first appear; and they themselves are static images, passing before him "like figures on a marble urn, / When shifted round to see the other side" (11. 5-6). At the third visit, there is a faint move toward Reversal as he belatedly identifies the departing shades and for a moment longs to follow them, like the "Nightingale" speaker, on "wings." "They faded, and, for- sooth! I wanted wings" (1. 41). In the absence of the will to act, his Discovery, which is a true recognition, leads to rejection, and he concludes by choosing to remain below the threshold of action, dismissing the bringers of challenge as the man emerging from the vision dismisses the nightingale. In "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and "Ode to Psyche," on the other hand, a third kind of encounter takes place which in its own terms is successful. In both, the speaker is an impersonal, willingly active, awakening force, like Coleridge's storm-wind or Shelley's West Wind and unlike the man in "Ode to a Nightingale"; and the object of address is also the object of action per- formed not with or through but upon it. If Coleridge's and Shelley's apostrophes function as a kind of theurgy, Keats's rhetoric in these two odes is a magical incantation employed in what amounts to an unspelling ritual. Like Endymion waking the dead lovers in the palace of Glaucus (iii.768 f.), each speaker drives toward the reanimation of a product of art-the scenes in the sculptured frieze, the sleeping lovers from Apuleius' tale of Cupid and Psyche- which itself is or might be the suspension of ac- tion frorn some past time. By amplified epithet and rhetorical question, which dissolve the boundaries between two kinds of reality and two periods in time, the person contemplating the Grecian urn is able to advance steadily from the urn as a physical object, to the scene portrayed in the frieze, and then beyond both until he has all but conjured into visible existence a scene in life out of which the sculp- tured scene might have come-the "little town" whose population has been lured into the un- changing world of art. Image is on the point of being turned back into action. In "Ode to Psyche," the speaker assumes the role of priest to Psyche and the whole ode is a prayer, devo- tional and intimate rather than challenging or supplicating. Psyche is saluted by reverent epi- thets-"O Goddess!" "O latest born and loveliest vision"; "O brightest!"-and rhetoric and vision react on each other, not to frustrate the process but to carry it forward: "I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd." This poem is one of the best examples of the fusion of process and product. The prayer promises formal worship in a "fane" which the priest-poet will build in "some untrod- den region of my mind"-where, incidentally, the fancy occupies an appropriate subordinate place (11. 59-63)-and by the closing lines the fane in effect has been built in the ode itself. The ritual of worship is identical with the reanimation and renewed union of Psyche and the winged god of love, which now has been made possible. As in the "Nightingale" ode, the climax is marked by the image of an open casement: "A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, / To let the warm Love in!" But now the casement leads inward, to bring together the divine and the human in the same mediating realm of art that is represented by the Grecian urn. In neither ode, however, is the reanimation completed. "Ode to Psyche" stops short of the consummation of Psyche's union with Cupid; the meditation in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" abruptly leaves the vision of the deserted "little town" and comes back to the urn as an entity in itself, con- cluding with a proposition in universal terms which the urn itself is made to utter. In the one instance, the priestly incantation appropriately ceases as its end is about to be realized, rhetoric giving way to "real" action. In the other, the silence and emptiness of the "real" town, when it is revealed, makes any further effort at reanima- tion useless; the inhabitants who left in sacrificial procession now have their only existence in the scene on the urn, where they are arrested forever in mid-journey. The Reversal that does take place, from life back to art and from conscious-</page><page sequence="13">Irene H. Chayes 79 ness to object, amounts to a ventriloquist's with- drawal by which the speaker allows, or compels, the urn to supplant him in his own role and hence to change its character. The "sylvan historian," which earlier told its "flowery tale" in spatial, pictorial terms, speaks finally in words, con- jured into prophecy if not into life, and with the famous aphorism on beauty and truth brings the ode to rest at last in Thought alone.42 If the Romantic ode had followed an orderly line of chronological development, the several odes last considered might have belonged to either the first historical stage or the last. It was "Ode to the West Wind," however, the purest example of the form as it has been defined in this study, that was also the latest, preceded by a few months by the odes of Keats, which vary widely among themselves; "Intimations of Immor- tality," more rhetorical than dramatic, was closely contemporaneous in its beginnings with "Dejection," the earliest ode in which the rhe- torical-dramatic structure appears and next after "West Wind" in completeness. The line of de- velopment the Romantic ode did follow was oblique, moving from poet to poet and poem to poem and approaching the common, implicit norm with varying degrees of closeness as oc- casion permitted. This, too, has its significance. It cannot be an accident that so many of the odes that have been examined here begin from a sub- jective state of weakness or depression and deal openly with failure of some kind, especially a failure of heightened creative consciousness, as a possibility, an unexpected affliction, or a painful fact of existence. In the ode, with its established Preromantic tendency to fuse the rhetoric of address with a process of mind, it was possible to make a direct moral confrontation of all that threatened the poetry-making activity from within, and to do so in a form of poetry itself. Whether or not failure was actually avoided or transcended, the final product nevertheless would be a poem, a work of art which by virtue of its very coming into being represented a victory over its subject. At the same time, as a highly subtle dramatic lyric the Romantic ode was part of a limited con- tinuity, extending back to the early seventeenth century and that "Metaphysical tradition" to which critics not lonlg ago saw everything Romantic as totally antithetical, and forward into the later nineteenth century. The name of Browning has been mentioned in this study; but, although particular odes may have been his- torical precursors of his dramatic monologue- Gray's Preromantic "Bard" was surely one- that uncertain Victorian form was not a true continuation of the Romantic ode. Browning's conception is theatrical rather than dramatic, usually leading away from the poem to some broader set of events or relationships that must be inferred from what takes place in the poem; the discoveries he provides for are more typically part of the reader's experience than the protag- onist's and serve Character rather than Plot. The subtler drama of shift, progression, and enlight- enment in the course of what is formally a rhe- torical address or a subjective meditation contin- ued instead in poems which might well have been called odes, although some may belong to no named generic category at all: Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach" or "The Buried Life"; certain of the monster sonnets of Gerard Manley Hopkins, which break out of one traditional genre to ap- proach another; or such a poem as Yeats's "Among School Children," which begins from a particularized, outer scene and concludes in a universalizing rhetorical question that just misses being an aphorism, carrying into a third literary period the particular-to-general pattern of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" and, earlier, Gray's "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College." Yet in these poems the drama of the Romantic ode merely survived, it did not develop further, and in its survival it lacked its original power. The profound impulse that had produced and sustained it had vanished from English poetry. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND College Park 4e Keats's two odes to Fanny Brawne and "To Autumn" are excluded from this discussion because there is no actual encounter between speaker and object in either instance. The implied flesh-and-blood presence of the woman in the Brawne odes draws the speaker's appeals outside the poem at the same time that it prevents him from being affected dramat- ically by what he has said. In "To Autumn," although the season is duly saluted in the second person, the speaker remains only a voice, and the encomium is hardly more than a scaffolding for imagery of description and personification which has a thematic not a dramatic significance.</page></plain_text>
