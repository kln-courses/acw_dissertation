<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY VOLUME 97, No. 2 WHOLE No. 386 ARTEMIS IN THE AGAMEMNON One of the most vexed questions of Aeschylean criticism concerns the reasons for Artemis' anger in the parodos of the Agamemnon. In spite of comparatively copious and certainly divergent scholarly opinion the problem has not yet been satis- factorily resolved. On the way to Troy the Greek expedition is confronted with a portent, two eagles rending a pregnant hare. The eagles sym- bolize the Atreidae and the hare Troy, while the foetus within the hare appears to symbolize the inhabitants human and animal of the doomed city. The portent predicts the sack of Troy, but Artemis 'bears a grudge against the winged hounds of her father which slaughter for a sacrifice the poor trembling hare with her young before the birth, and she loathes the feast of the eagles 'The Fair One, kindly though she be towards the helpless dewdrops of ravening lions and pleasant to the suckling young of all creatures that roam the field, yet consents to fulfil that which the encounter portends for this undertaking, the signs which appear favourable yet betoken disapproval." Now if we approach this in terms of what is explicit and forbear for the moment to relate it to the imagery of the im- mediate context or to that of the trilogy as a whole, we shall note that Artemis' anger is directed at the content of the portent itself and not at what it portends. She 'loathes the feast of the eagles' because she is the protectress of the young of animals. But critics have been disturbed at the suggestion that the 1 Fraenkel's translation of 135-38, 140-45, Agamemnon, Vol. I.

LAWRENCE goddess should be angry merely at the content of the portent and not at its analogue. Accordingly, they have either assumed, or employed a number of arguments to establish that Artemis is significantly angry at what the portent represents. For my part I can see no reason to be disturbed by the possibility that Artemis is angry at the content of the portent alone, even though this means that she is not angry with Agamemnon. This is because it does not necessarily follow that Agamemnon is thereby exoner- ated of guilt in the trilogy or that his guilt-the precise nature of which we have yet to determine-is unrelated to the sacrifice of his daughter, which is in turn the direct cause of his punishment through Clytemnestra's vengeance. I shall presently show that Artemis is in fact angry only at the content of the portent, or rather it will emerge on closer analysis that the motivation and psychology of Artemis are finally irrelevant, and that the inci- dent is contrived by Aeschylus in order to accommodate the mythological tradition as far as possible to the close-knit theol- ogy of the trilogy. I shall begin by surveying previous scholarship. Artemis' anger has been explained variously: 1. As directed at Agamemnon because he shot a stag and boasted of it-that is to say Aeschylus expected his audi- ence to assume the traditional account which comes to us through Proclus' epitome of the Cypria.2 2. As directed at the literal events of the portent alone and not at its analogue, a view adopted by Page, but as demonstra- tion of Aeschylus' intellectual inadequacy. 3. As directed at the eagles of the portent, and thus to the Atreidae, simply because the eagles symbolize them. 4. As directed at Agamemnon on account of some sin he will commit in the course of the sack of Troy as symbolized by the killing of the hare by the eagles. 1. The first view, that Aeschylus wants us to assume the traditional account of Artemis' anger at Agamemnon, is either 2 See Fraenkel. Vol. II. 97f.; J. J. Peradotto, 'The Omen of the Eagles and the 170oc of Agamemnon.' Phoenix 23 (1969) 237-63; 242f. 98</page><page sequence="3">ARTEMIS IN THE 'AGAMEMNON" rejected outright by critics or raised as an improbable possibili- ty. Fraenkel justly maintains: 'It must be regarded as an estab- lished and indeed a guiding principle for any interpretation of Aeschylus that the poet does not want us to take into account any feature of a tradition which he does not mention.'3 But this sound principle is violated by Lloyd-Jones who refers Artemis' anger, if not to Agamemnon's traditional sin, at least to her Trojan sympathies in the Iliad. Her 'blow against Agamemnon ... is the attempt of a pro-Trojan goddess to strike at the invaders before the invasion.'4 Peradotto, on the other hand, adhering to the principle enunciated by Fraenkel, provides sufficient refutation of Lloyd-Jones.5 Apart from the manifest dangers of relying on even the most familiar Homeric tradition in the absence of substantiation from the text, it should be clearly understood that Artemis' anger must be finally sub- sumed under the will of Zeus. That is, Artemis' reaction must be intended, foreseen or at least approved by Zeus, otherwise a cardinal event of the trilogy, Agamemnon's doom, is made dependent on a cause which bears no relation to Agamemnon's individual guilt in the sight of Zeus. Joseph Fontenrose ('Gods and Men in the Oresteia,' TAPA 102 [1971] 71-109) denies Agamemnon's guilt in the sight of Zeus. Now while I cannot hope at present to do full justice to this important discussion, a number of points should be at least suggested. While it is true that there is no explicit reference in the text to Zeus's attitude to Agamemnon, three passages are especially important: a. the reference to Agamemnon's jaQaxo:id after his deci- sion (223)-this recalls other passages in Aeschylus where di- vine causation is explicitly related to human infatuation. It seems reasonable to take it that Zeus and the Olympians are not inactive here; b. the reference to the :roi'Vxrovo; (461), the TTroilut6 Or70 (472) and the man of excessive reputation (467-68) in the first stasimon is much more concerned with Agamemnon than with Paris (Fontenrose, 75ff.), and 3Agamemnon, Vol. II, 97. 4 H. Lloyd-Jones, 'The Guilt of Agamemnon,' CQ 12 (1962) 190. 5 pp. 240f. 99</page><page sequence="4">STUART E. LAWRENCE c. the carpet scene confirms our suspicions about Agamem- non's state of mind (it is designed for us rather than for Zeus) and clearly demonstrates his delight in his reputation. This vanity cannot be reduced to a mere foible. The audience would assume that Zeus would punish such an attitude. That no di- vine reaction is registered (Fontenrose, 104) shows merely that the implications of the trampling would be obvious to any Greek in his right wits, be he mortal or immortal. 2. The second view, that Artemis is angry merely at the eagles and not at what they symbolize, is espoused by Page. 'Now this crime, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, is given by Aes- chylus the most extraordinary motive. Instead of tracing it back to the mortal's offence against divinity, or otherwise linking it to the destiny of the house of Atreus, the poet tells us in plain language that Artemis was enraged because eagles, sent by Zeus to be an encouraging portent, happened to devour a hare to- gether with its unborn young; she therefore demanded a 'second sacrifice,' the death of Iphigenia, in return for the death of the hare and its young.'6 Page has rightly insisted here on the 'plain testimony of the text,'7 which attributes Artemis' anger explicitly to the content of the portent; and indeed it must be emphasized that the sac- rifice of Iphigenia must be related to Agamemnon's guilt. That it is so related will be shown if Artemis' anger can be linked to the will of Zeus. Even if Artemis bears no grudge against Agamem- non, Zeus might use her anger at the literal events of the portent in order to place the mortal in a situation which would lead ultimately to his death; and indeed Zeus's contrivance of Agamemnon's death can be directly related to his sin. But Page denies this sin, because, he argues, the war is the will of Zeus and Agamemnon's decision is fated. Certainly the war is the will of Zeus, and the portent predicts its successful conduct. It is also true that Agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter if the expedition is to go ahead. But this is not necessarily to say that Agamemnon's decision is predetermined; it may simply be fore- seen by Zeus and thus incorporated into his plan for Troy and the House of Atreus. Page argues that Agamemnon has no real 6Aeschylus. Agamemnon. Ed. J. D. Denniston &amp; D. L.

The real, unacknowledged motivation comes to light at first dimly in the theological language of the chorus' comment on the decision (218-27) and further in the ever clearer association of Agamemnon with the sin of pride, that is to say in the odes and in the carpet scene.'0 Agamemnon's guilt is not in the choice for war, although some critics regard the war as wrong (notwithstanding the will of Zeus),1" but in his personal motives. He makes the right decision for the wrong reason, from a flawed and limited human perspective. It is Agamemnon's pride then which must be related to the will of Zeus, and Zeus's will in turn to Artemis' anger and to the sacrifice of Iphigenia. Page's analysis has the virtue of insisting on a close reading of the text in respect of Artemis' anger, but his conclusion that Aeschylus is not a coherent religious dramatist is simply non- sense. Even Fraenkel suggests that the 'power of his song' would keep us from 'idle speculation or curiosity about details,' details in fact upon which the meaning of the trilogy intimately depends.12 3. The view that Artemis hates the Atreidae because she hates the eagles which symbolize them is almost too naive to require formal refutation. On this theory the reader is referred to Fraenkel.13 It should perhaps be remarked that a similar naivete does not attach to the view that only the eagles are loathed by 8 p. xxvi. 9 See Peradotto on Page (253f.). 10 See for example the chorus' generalizations concerning those who trample in the dust the beauty of holy things (369-72), the dangers of wealth (376f.) and reputation (468-70) and their reluctance to be excessive in their praise of Agamemnon (782-89). 11 See for example Kitto, F &amp; M, p. 4: 'Aeschylus does not wish us to abdicate our commonsense, and to regard this "war for a wanton woman" as ajust one.'

This is because the portent is not merely symbolic, but is rather a real event involving real eagles and a real hare, and therefore a fit object for the goddess' anger. 4. The view that Artemis hates Agamemnon for a sin which he will commit at Troy symbolized by the portent is the most widespread among the commentators, although there is disa- greement as to the nature of this sin. Before embarking on a discussion of these critics it should be reiterated that the text does not clearly indicate the extension of Artemis' anger beyond the content of the portent. On the contrary, it states that she hates the eagles' feast and does so in her capacity as protec- tress of wild animals. How then can we be justified in leaping hence to the conclusion that she hates what is symbolized by the portent? We shall come presently to critics who appear to acknowledge this difficulty and attempt to solve it, I believe, unsuccessfully. Some take it as almost a mark of literal- mindedness to entertain the possibility that Artemis' wrath does not extend beyond the portent itself.14 At any rate, the problem must be borne in mind as we examine the various views. Hammond argues that 'the adverse wind was sent by Ar- temis, "because she loathes the feast of the eagles" (135f.), that is because she loathes the bloodshed of the war which Agamemnon and Menelaus are starting . . she is the goddess of the weak and helpless and she abominates the brutality of the impending war (140f.). Calchas, having second sight, had al- ready foreseen the reaction of Artemis to the prospect of war (135f.) . ..15 The translation of Artemis' anger from the portent to its analogue here is performed as a matter of course. The references provided by Hammond do not establish Artemis' reaction to the impending war but merely to the eagles' feast. The notion of brutality and violated innocence occurs regu- larly in the critics, particularly in the form of reference to the 'innocent' Trojans. Kitto in Greek Tragedy puts a view which, unfortunately, he implicitly retracts in Form and Meaning: that 14 Fraenkel, 97. Peradotto rightly criticizes the naive view that Artemis is angry at the Atreidae because the eagles symbolize them, but considers it 'a fatal step further' to say that Artemis is angry only with the eagles (p. 240 and Note 12). 15N. G. L. Hammond, 'Personal Freedom and its Limitations in the Oresteia,' Aeschylus (Twentieth Century Views) ed. McCall, 95f. 102</page><page sequence="7">ARTEMIS IN THE 'AGAMEMNON"' the Trojans are guilty accomplices of Paris.16 And surely this is correct. I can find no explicit reference to Trojan innocence in the Agamemnon, despite pity for the victims of war, a pity not at all inconsistent with the view that the Trojans got what they deserved. It is clear throughout that the war was planned by Zeus in accordance with a form of justice never condemned, even if in some degree superseded later in the trilogy. The references to violence involved in the sack of Troy are not disapproving, but invoked as evidence of Zeus's inevitable, relentless and precise justice.17 It is sometimes argued that because Agamemnon is a poly- ktonos he has incurred the enmity of Artemis and of the gods in general (461-74). The danger of the polyktonos is real enough, but critics have brought to bear a kind of Euripidean humanity in order to conclude that the gods object to the carnage. This interpretation is by no means obviously correct in the Greek milieu, and the context suggests that the polyktonos is synonymous with the successful military commander whose fame is thereby dangerously overblown (468f.)-hence the chorus' wish to avoid the role of sacker of cities (xnroittr6QOr, 472). Now Agamemnon's sin in the play is clearly pride which is defined by his membership of a wealthy family with a history of sin (for wealth is conducive to sin), by his sacrifice of his daughter, and by his military success which almost inevitably fosters pride in the man that wins it. That it has indeed done so in Agamemnon's case is confirmed by the carpet scene. His slaughter of innocent life is confined to the sacrifice of his daughter, and this is symptomatic of his essential sin of pride. The sacrifice provides a direct link between his sin and his death. I shall presently relate this to my interpretation of Ar- temis in the play, but for the moment I shall draw on the above observations in dealing with previous views. In Greek Tragedy Kitto argues that Artemis is moved to indignation by 'the wanton destruction of life committed by the eagles. ... The point of the comparison is the indiscriminate destruction of life that this war must bring."18 Kitto is referring 16 Greek Tragedy, 66. 17 Ag. 355-66. 18p. 66. 103</page><page sequence="8">STUART E. LAWRENCE not to the Trojans but to the Greeks. He points to the rage felt at Argos against Agamemnon: '. .. and if rage concerning the dead is visited in this way on Agamemnon, it will be the coun- terpart, on the level of ordinary reality, of the indignation felt by Artemis towards the eagles.'19 Kitto makes it clear that, in his view, Artemis hates not only the eagles' feast, but the indis- criminate slaughter.20 It must be objected, however, that the comparison suggested by Kitto is nowhere related to Artemis' anger. Certainly the Argives are angry at the loss of lives in the recovery of a wanton woman, but the war is justified on the divine level as the Dike of Zeus Xenios, as Kitto himself insists.21 The 'indiscriminate destruction of life' is pathetic but inevitable; it is not Agamemnon's significant sin, which is rather his pride. Moreover there is no link explicit or implicit between Artemis' stated anger at the eagles' feast and the destruction of the Greeks. Further, the portent itself suggests the destruction of Troy and its inhabitants, not of the Greeks, and finally there is no imagistic association between the portent scene and the ode which describes the indignation felt by the surviving relatives.22 In Form and Meaning Kitto relates the foetus of the hare to the 'innocent population of Troy.'23 Artemis is angry with Agamemnon because he is 'contemplating a war.'24 The shed- ding of his daughter's blood parallels 'the lawless bloodshed of which he will be guilty if he goes on with this war "for a wanton woman" '.25 But there is no indication in the text that Artemis is opposed to war, nor is there evidence that Agamemnon's shed- ding of Trojan (or Greek) blood was lawless. On the contrary, it was essential to the fulfilment of Zeus's plans. Certainly Agamemnon's evil motive for the expedition (personal glory) does not excuse all this loss of life, but in terms of Zeus's purpose the bloodshed is justified. Kitto suggests that 19 p. 67. 20 Ibid. 21 Agamemnon is destroyed 'for doing what Zeus ordained in the way that Zeus foresaw' (Greek Tragedy, 67). 22 Ag. 438-55. 23p. 3. 24 p. 4. 25 Ibid. 104</page><page sequence="9">ARTEMIS IN THE "AGAMEMNON" Agamemnon should have abandoned the expedition.26 On the contrary, it should be argued that the expedition was a just attempt to vindicate the law of Zeus Xenios, but that Agamem- non should have embarked upon it with pure motives, pleading the will of Zeus rather than that of his fellow commanders: a mere pretext, conscious or unconscious, for his pride. The decision itself was right, the human motive wrong. Kitto goes on to justify his isolation of the theme of 'indis- criminate slaughter' by invoking the choral passage concerned with polyktonoi. But, as remarked above, it is unsafe to assume that inhumanity is being condemned here.27 Finley too argues that Artemis is angry at Agamemnon's decision for war: 'By destroying the calm and fruitful order of peace, war commits an offense against nature, and this offense is portrayed in the eagles' devouring of the hare.-The maiden Artemis is herself the innocence of peace.'28 Finley seems to depart further from the text than Kitto. Imagery such as 'calm and fruitful order of peace' finds no echo in the text and is thus misleading. While it must be admitted that the portent at least potentially symbolizes what Finley here suggests, we are still required, in the absence of specific direction by Aeschylus, to make an unwarranted imaginative leap. But Finley, unlike Kitto or Hammond, clearly recognizes the problem that while Artemis hates the eagles, there is no explicit mention of her hatred of what they symbolize. He seeks to bridge the apparent gap between symbol and analogue by blur- ring the distinction, and attempts to justify this by means of a generalization about the mythological mind. 'Aeschylus is not saying that, because the eagles devoured the hare, Artemis held the fleet at Aulis and offered Agamemnon his terrible choice. Rather, the devouring of the hare by the eagles expresses his act of choice itself. The seeming sequence from the eagles to Iphigenia's death is less a set of causal steps than a mythological statement of implicit meaning. Agamemnon's final and decisive act of guilt was in killing his daughter, but the choice followed 26 Ibid. 27p. 4. 28 J. H. Finley, Jr., Pindar and Aeschylus, Martin Classical Lectures XIV, (Cambridge, Mass., 1955) 253. 105</page><page sequence="10">STUART E. LAWRENCE from his decision for war. .. To the logical mind Artemis' anger is rather a consequence than a cause of this terrifying cleft in nature. But to the mythological mind the goddess stands first in the sequence because the gods are inresident in our acts, reveal- ing what already is.'29 The dichotomy of logical and mythological mind, associating Aeschylus with the latter, is altogether too sharp. Certainly critics like Whallon, Peradotto and above all Lebeck30 have established a thematic association through imagery of the por- tent with the sacrifice and even the cena Thvestea-in this way the portent does indeed become a statement of implicit mean- ing. But this is a mark of the poetic mind in general, not espe- cially of the mythological. Lucas, for example, briefly enter- tains the possibility that 'Aeschylus identified, or made Artemis identify, as a modern poet might, the symbol and the object symbolized.'31 Lebeck, on the other hand, appears to follow Finley: 'The omen, spoken of as if it were the cause of anger, is rather a symbol of the cause, for the language of prophecy knows no sharp distinction between symbol and thing sym- bolized, between effect and cause.'32 Unfortunately Lebeck provides no examples to substantiate this crucial, and it seems to me, surprising generalization-surprising particularly in the light of Aeschylus' careful use of antithesis precisely in order to distinguish Artemis' attitude to the eagles from her attitude to the expedition. While it seems reasonable, nay essential, to refer to the im- plicit meanings of the portent apart from its literal meaning, that is to refer to the cena Tllvestea and the subsequent sacrifice of Iphigenia, indeed to the whole predatory morality of the first two plays, such a response in terms of imagistic association should not be allowed to overshadow or exclude the tight causal chain essential to the theology of the whole trilogy. To argue that there is no significant causal sequence from the portent through Artemis' wrath to Agamemnon's decision is to leave the dilemma facing Agamemnon causally unexplained.

Lucas, The Greek Tragic Poets, Third Edition (London 1959) p. 90. 32 Lebeck, 35. 106</page><page sequence="11">ARTEMIS IN THE "AGAMEMNON" must agree that Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice is related to his earlier decision to go to war; it is related insofar as it shows that his pride which depends on the successful conduct of the war is more important to him than his daughter's life. But Agamemnon's death is causally dependent on his dilemma which cannot be reduced, as Finley seems to attempt, to a mere imagistic or mythological reflection of his initial decision for war. While the gods of Greek religion are often 'inresident' in men's actions, not all of their intervention can be explained in this way. Agamemnon's dilemma is imposed on him by divine manipulation of outward circumstance; it is not a mere expres- sion of his psyche reflected on the divine level. Thus we find ourselves again confronted with the problem that Artemis' anger is related explicitly to the content of the portent, but not explicitly to its analogue, whatever this may turn out to be. The only way out of this impasse would seem to be in terms of associations of imagery. Whallon for example argues that Artemis reacts to the portent in terms of'her love for every kind of helpless offspring. The vocabulary in which the symbolism is couched conveys the lack of distinction between human and bestial lives: the chorus sees the Atridae as vultures bereft not of their chicks but of their nraiwov (Ag. 50), and sees Helen not as a cub but as an Tvtv (Ag. 718) of a lion.'33 Whallon then allows himself an inaccurate paraphrase of 140-43, refer- ring to Artemis' 'tender regard for the young lions and the suckling young of every kind.'34 This blurs the distinction be- tween human and animal lives in favour of Whallon's argument, while the Greek insists on animal lives: 6QbaooL darrot; ya2rEeQv EOvrTCV 7rdvrC(v r' T ayovo6/v (citofadoTOt; OriQtv opfQLxdtxao ToeQTva (141-43) While one must concede that the imagery of the trilogy as a whole induces us to see the predatory laws of nature as analog- ous to the ancient Dike worked out in the human world of the 33p. 82. 34 Ibid. 107</page><page sequence="12">STUART E. LAWRENCE first two plays, we cannot concede that this imagistic associa- tion applies to Artemis' conscious motivation, the relevance of which seems to be assumed by the majority of critics. Artemis reacts only in terms of her concern for young animal lives. Whallon too refers to Trojan innocents,35 but only Peradotto has attempted to justify the recurrent critical assumption that Aeschylus wants us to regard at least some of the Trojans as innocent. Peradotto claims that it is 'as patroness of innocent youth and fertility that Artemis recoils from the indiscriminate predation which she knows a war under the Atreidae will be.'36 Again this is not explicit in the text, and will have to be sup- ported by reference to association of imagery. Peradotto agrees with Fraenkel that the destruction of hare and foetus implies that 'Troy and all that is in the city will be completely and violently destroyed,'37 and he takes this as an 'indirect reference to young Trojan victims of the war.'38 But the young of the portent are not necessarily to be translated into the young of Troy, and the notion that all Troy will be violently destroyed does not especially single out the young. However, Peradotto draws our attention to a detail of the next choral ode (357-61). He sees in this passage, 'concentrating as it does upon the fate of the young,' an emphasis on the 'barbaric completeness of the havoc (arrj; :avacJTro7)).'39 But the Greek phrase means 'de- struction involving universal capture.' Whether or not this is barbaric must emerge from the immediate context and be refer- red to the theology of the trilogy as a whole. In the context of the ode at any rate the emotional response 'barbaric' is quite inap- propriate. The chorus begin by apostrophizing Zeus and kindly Night in favourable terms for granting Greece a successful capture of Troy. Then follows the reference to the net of de- struction from which the young could not escape. The sub- sequent verses assert Zeus's justice visited upon Paris and the Trojans whose guilt appears to be referred to their overflowing wealth (376f.). If the young are singled out as unable to escape, 35p. 83. 36 p. 247. 37 Fraenkel, Vol. II, 96; Peradotto, 247. 38 p. 247. 39 p. 248. 108</page><page sequence="13">ARTEMIS IN THE "AGAMEMNON" this emphasizes the all-inclusive nature of Zeus'sjustice; it does not supply a reason for Artemis' anger at Agamemnon or suggest that he should have spared the young. In conclusion it would seem impossible to establish explicitly or even implicitly through imagistic association Artemis' anger at the analogue of the portent. Let us then explore the possibility that she objects only to the eagles' feast. We have seen that the text seems decidedly in favour of such a view. We are told that Artemis hates the eagles' feast (138), that she is concerned for young animal life, so that she consents or approves of the fulfilment of what the portent symbolizes: rovcrwv alrel svlpo)a xedvat, &amp;e?Lta ev xarTdao/ca as DaCorara . . . (144f.) This distinction between portent and analogue is clearly made by the poet. If Artemis consents to the fulfilment of what is portended, we cannot take the liberty of interpreting this to mean that she approves of the destruction of Troy but not of the young within it. What are the implications of this view for the theology of the trilogy? Artemis places Agamemnon in a dilemma. As Peradotto declares, she does not demand the sacrifice outright, but presents Agamemnon with a real choice.40 Yet the mortal decides in favour of his pride. The result is Clytemnestra's wrath, dimly foreseen by Calchas (146-55), and finally Agamemnon's doom. In this way his death is linked with his pride. But if Artemis is an independent agent, Zeus must have in some way foreseen or provided for her reaction, otherwise his plans for the descendants of Atreus would depend on arbitrary divine intervention beyond his control. The portent comes from Zeus; Artemis reacts in terms of her sphere of interest, and Agamemnon is placed in a dilemma. Now Aeschylus is certainly not stating outright that Zeus foresees Artemis' reaction, al- though this is logically essential, as long as we are talking about conscious anthropomorphic deities. And yet the whole psychological approach to Artemis is perhaps beside the point. Let us approach the matter dramaturgically. Aeschylus 40 pp. 249ff. 109</page><page sequence="14">STUART E. LAWRENCE wishes to incorporate Agamemnon's punishment for his indi- vidual sin of pride and for his inherited guilt within Zeus's plan for the House of Atreus. In sending Agamemnon to Troy Zeus knows that he will, through his success, incur the sin of pride. Now the myth has Agamemnon killed by his wife. It also pre- sents him sacrificing his daughter to Artemis in return for favourable winds. Clearly Clytemnestra's murder of her hus- band can be motivated by the sacrifice of her daughter, and his significant sin in divine eyes, his pride, can be made the cause of his decision to sacrifice. But the myth referred Artemis' anger to an incident unrelated to the sack of Troy. In Aeschylus Agamemnon has committed no offence at the time of his di- lemma, but he will commit the sin of pride during the war. However, the choice of sacrifice will reflect this latent pride later to be swollen by military success. Accordingly, Zeus is angry at Agamemnon for his future sin of pride (which the god foresees), and so he engineers his punishment for it in advance through Artemis' reaction to the portent. Agamemnon faces a dilemma caused by Zeus and related to a future sin; he then makes a decision which the god foresees but does not predeter- mine. Artemis' anger at the literal content of the portent is employed by Zeus in order to create Agamemnon' s dilemma. Or rather it is employed by the dramatist who is not concerned finally with Artemis' psychology. Since he could not eliminate the goddess from the play without excessive violence to the myth, he was obliged to subordinate her clearly to the will of Zeus. Once we see her as functioning on the level of a dramatur- gical device and not as a metaphysical principle we shall cease to ask why she rather than Zeus is angry, or to be concerned that her anger, necessary to the superficial dramaturgy alone, is related only to the content of the portent.
