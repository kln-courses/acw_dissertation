Introduction There is a special urgency about the developing patterns of military relationships that are visible in the modern world. This urgency is expressed through a wide range of ideological and philosophical prisms. It is felt rather differently depending on geographical region. Sometimes concern is raised over highly spe- cific weapons systems. At other times there is no more than a vague sense of broad historical trends. In whatever way this urgency is understood or expressed, it has undoubtedly become one of the most pressing themes in political life in the late twen- tieth century. The most obvious concern, at least in more pro- sperous societies, arises from the deployment of nu- clear technology. The promise of final annihilation has transcended the bounds of religious eschatology to become an all too real possibility. This concern is heightened by instabilities in the geo-political and strategic relations between the superpowers. The changing configurations of global power and multiple systemic and regional crises are made even more complex by a spectacular capacity for technological innovation in weapons systems. Whatever logic there has been to the way nuclear weapons have been managed over the past few decades now appears increasingly fragile. The teasing rituals of arms con- trol negotiations and the constant resort to technolo- gical solutions for political problems do not inspire confidence. While the so-called nuclear arms race between the superpowers claims most attention, many analysts now point to a more general insidious tendency to resort to military solutions to social and political con- flict on a global scale. Military force, it is suggested, is becoming both more violent and more thoroughly integrated into different arenas of human activity. Armaments are becoming more and more lethal, even when non nuclear. More significantly, they func- tion not only as weapons, but also as commodities, as both military and economic artefacts. In his classic study On War, published in 1832, Karl von Clausewitz depicted war as "a remarkable trinity" composed of primordial violence, hatred and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; of the play of chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and of its element of subordination as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to reason alone. The first of these three aspects mainly concerns the people; the second the commander and his army; the third, the government. These three tendencies are like three different codes of law, deep-rooted in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. A theory that ignores any one of them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship between them would conflict with reality to such an extent that for this reason alone it would be totally useless (quoted in Howard 1983, p. 73). In the century and a half since that time, the social structures that allowed Clausewitz to make these distinctions have altered considerably. The phra- seology that now accompanies analysis of prepara- tions for war is likely to be dominated less by diffe- rentiations than by aggregations and hyphens, by complexes of military-industrial-bureaucratic and technological forces. This reflects the internationali- zation of production as well as changing patterns of state conflict. The processes of militarization visible in the modern world engage as much with the catego- ries of political economy as with those of strategy and geo-politics. Where the logic of interstate relations may still bear some resemblance to tendencies to already identified by Thucydides, Kautilya or Machia- velli, modern forms of militarization also have to be understood as an integral aspect of the historical development of industrialization, capitalism and modernity. Suspicions have been aired that this is leading us to a novel phase in the organization of human affairs. Terms like 'militarism', 'militarization', 'extermi- nism', 'nuclearism', and 'war system' have been used to capture and probe a new set of global determina- tions, in which military production and deployments 50</page><page sequence="2">play a central role in constituting new forms of social life. At the very least, it is possible to identify interre- lated processes at work between the so-called 'milita- ry-bureaucratic-industrial complexes', superpower arms deployments, regional arms deployments, arms transfers to less affluent states, and the use of arma- ments as an instrument of repression within states.1 It is not difficult to find indicators of the way massive resources are being channelled in military directions, suggesting that something structurally significant is going on. To take but one symbolic example, the material resources spent annually on armed forces around the globe currently exceed the total income of the poorest half of the world's people. Military forces, arms races, armaments production, and so on are not only matters of exotic hardware being deployed on behalf of conflicting "national in- terests", but also of cultural forms and discourses: of "strategies", fantasies, rhetorics, symbolic orders and languages. In fact one of the most striking aspects of our current predicament is the extraordinary gap be- tween the sophistication of the technologies of de- struction and the banality of the rhetoric, sophistry, values and "psychology" that accompanies its deploy- ment. This has led a variety of commentators to stress the particular "competence" of students in the huma- nities in this context, not only as representatives of "humanity", but as specialists in the textual and dis- cursive character of contemporary preparations for war.2 Certainly, much of the rather sparse literature on the cultural context of contemporary militarization suggests that cultural forms - ways of thinking and expressing ourselves - are increasingly conditioned by military structures. Conversely, the cultural sphere is often an important source of legitimacy for tenden- cies towards militarization. This cultural dimension is of primary concern here. More specifically, I want to explore the connection between two theoretical problematics that have gene- rally been treated in isolation. On the one hand, there is the empirical analysis of contemporary processes of militarization. On the other, there is a concern with the conceptual and theoretical coherence of our understanding of these empirical processes. Culture, I will argue, is crucial in both. An emerging body of literature has begun to delineate ways in which pro- cesses of militarization engage with, produce, and transform particular cultural forms and identities. I want to use this literature to examine some ways in which our understanding of these processes is mediat- ed at the cultural level. To grasp what is at stake here, it is only necessary to think briefly about such an apparently simple phrase as "the arms race". It is far from being a simple phrase. It resonates at many cultural levels, all the way from sporting metaphors to deeply rooted assumptions about the essentially competitive nature of human existence. And as a theoretical category it is seriously misleading. The term suggests a race to some well- defined end, in which the critical issue is the per- ceived relation between the contestants: A does something, B responds, A responds in turn, and so on. There is something to this image, but it ignores the way that recent arms deployments have been largely the result not of what the other side has done, but of the available technology, the state of the econ- omy, allocations made for defense budgets, pressure from the armed services and bureaucratic institu- tions, intra-alliance politics and Murphy's Law. This is a process in which competition between states as such plays a relatively small role.3 Mediation on examples like this, and the broader connection between cultural processes and forms of understanding that they imply is especially important given the somewhat fragile state of our knowledge about contemporary patterns of militarization. Detailed analysis abounds, yet there is considerable disagreement about even the most fundamental cate- gories. There are many blunt assertions about the way things are and what ought to be done. Yet this is an area in which it is more appropriate to admit the tenta- tive quality of what we claim to know and what we think possible. This is so in at least three important respects. First and most obviously, it is partly a matter of ina- dequate theoretical concepts and lack of research. At best we have indications of apparent trends and a variety of more or less plausible explanations of some aspects of a very complex affair. Some fundamental theoretical disputes are also of significance here, espe- cially about whether these trends are best understood as an outgrowth of the logic of the states-system, imperialism, kapitalogic or some more complex com- bination. In this context, culture enters the picture primarily in terms of the relationship between militarization and cultural production. From this direction it is pos- sible to suggest ways in which the cultural realm parti- cipates in the construction of the specific political, bureaucratic and economic structures through which a resort to military force is encouraged. It is also pos- sible to examine the broad cultural contexts in which militarization is interpreted and legitimized. Second, it is partly a matter not only of scarce con- 51</page><page sequence="3">ceptual or explanatory apparatus; we also run up against serious limits to our capacity to speak of war at all. Here the advent of nuclear weaponry is crucial. A nuclear war, it is often said, simply cannot be - at least not in any sense in which the concept of war still carries any meaning for us. Nuclear weapons under- mine our conception of what war is and under what conditions it might be legitimate. These limits are already at play in the early formulations of nuclear deterrence theory. They are expressed in Bernard Brodie's classic claim that "thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on the chief purpose must be to avert them" (Brodie 1946, p. 83). Nuclear weapons were quickly recognized as introducing a major dispropor- tionality between ends and means. Only the threat to use, not the actual use of nuclear weapons was assumed to be understandable - and then only margi- nally - as the continuation of politics by other means. Even so, while this cliché of deterrence has played a significant role in the development of declaratory policy, the counter-assertion that nuclear weapons have not really changed things much has continued to be very influential in practice. Recent controversies between deterrence and war-fighting theorists reflect a fundamental disagreement on whether the limits of our understanding of the place of war in human affairs have been reached. The suspicion that they have is re- inforced by the fact that nuclear war itself is discussed in terms of a chilling melange of instrumental techni- que, utilitarian models of rational choice, and apoca- lyptic religion - all discourses in which the moment of politics is neatly evaded. In this context, culture enters from a rather differ- ent direction. The limits on our ability to speak cohe- rently about war and the scale of our capacity for de- struction further exposes - and intensify - a number of contradictions already visible in the cultural tradi- tions of Western modernity. Here it is possible to frame the issues less in terms of specific instrumental structures than of the more general critiques of ratio- nalization, reification and bureaucratization that have been central to an understanding of political life in this century. From this direction we can see how pro- cesses of militarization impinge on a number of fun- damental values we have come to take for granted - specifically reason, democracy and security - in a way that undermines many of the categories through which political and military affairs are understood. Third, it is not clear how it is possible to enter into an effective critical engagement with the emerging trends that have been tentatively identified. While it seems obvious enough that we live in a world in which military structures have become increas- ingly dangerous - unstable, irrational, wasteful, re- pressive and inhumane - weapons continue to be produced as of there were no tomorrow. It is not only that our analytical capacity is inadequate or that the scale of our insecurity strains at the limits of our lan- guage and imagination. It is also that we seem to con- front structures that are beyond the bounds of effec- tive political action. In this context culture enters primarily in connec- tion with changes in the character and especially the location of political life. A triple movement in involved here. On the one hand there is an expansion of political reference from the state to some broader "community". In this context, culture as such is less important than cultures. Attention is drawn to the manner in which different societies respond to emerg- ing military structures in ways that reflect their loca- tion within global divisions of labour and power. On the other hand, there is a contraction of political reference. Global patterns of militarization now bear upon the most immediate and local aspects of every- day life and consciousness. In between, the conven- tional focus of political identity - the state - is in- creasingly implicated in the construction of global military structures. Indeed, the state has become the crucial point of integration between the geo-strategic and economic forces that give rise to modern forms of militarization. From this direction, therefore, culture enters as a quest for human identity. It will be quite apparent that the term culture is being used here in a variety of ways. This is intenti- onal. Culture is a multifaceted concept, bearing traces of a complex historical lineage.4 1 propose to use the scope and flexibility of the term to draw attention to the range of current research being conducted in these three contexts, and to use this research to explore how our understanding of contemporary militarization participates in a variety of cultural pro- cesses. I will then draw upon this analysis to explore two groups of problems in greater detail: the relation- ship between militarization and language or dis- course; and the relationship between militarization, culture and political practice. In both cases, it is pos- sible to see how processes of militarization enter into the very categories through which such processes are analysed and understood. All these themes converge on our understanding of the modern state. The article will therefore conclude with a reading of the cultural politics of the state in the context of contemporary forms of insecurity. It will do 52</page><page sequence="4">so by reflecting on the theme of bureaucracy intro- duced by Max Weber early in this century and by suggesting ways in which Weber's own formulation of the politics of the modern state must be challenged. 2.1. Militarization and Cultural Production The most systematic analysis of the relationship be- tween militarization and culture is currently focussed on changing patterns of cultural production in the af- fluent industrial societies. In these societies, weapons systems are among our most sophisticated artefacts. As products of modern science and technology, they reflect the character and self-identity of the society that produces them. It is therefore not surprising that weapons have become symbols, woven into a great variety of myths and fantasies. More than this, they have become cultural commodities and an instrinsic part of the process of cultural production. Several observers have begun to speak of the fetishism of the weapon, with the term "fetish" taking on both a Freudian and a Marxian interpretation. To enquire the cultural roots of this particular obsession undoubtedly raises deep issues of cultural interpretation, and in this respect the names of Marx and Freud suggest a rich vein of interpretive possibili- ties. Yet it is not necessary to invoke deep theoretical insights to see that military iconography has become very important in a wide range of modern cultural forms, from explicit military propaganda (parades, adverts, air-shows) to games, sports, toys, clothing, films, videos, science fiction, war and spy novels, and so on. Video games, for example, now simulate everything from Custers Last Stand to the most robot- ic of space wars. Such forms are not entirely new. Nei- ther can they all be analysed as simple legitimations of militaristic tendencies; here, as elsewhere, the rela- tionship between cultural forms and political life is a matter of considerable complexity and dispute. But it is possible to take seriously Robin Luckham's sugges- tion that we are witnessing the novel development of specific "armaments culture".5 Luckham's analysis is essentially synoptic, and pro- vides the currently most powerful classification of a growing and potentially rich field of research. For Luckham, the issue is not just the effect of armaments upon cultural forms, but the way in which armaments have entered into the process of cultural production and reproduction, becoming both producer and pro- duct of the manifold forms of cultural activity. Luck- ham attributes special importance to the scientific estate, the security intellectuals, security managers, and various interpreters and publicists. He also sug- gests that the relationship is institutionalized and con- trolled through four principal instruments: direct state ownership of the means of cultural production; private ownership of such means, particularly through advertising; systems of professionalization and occupational regulation; and the structure and operation of the markets for cultural commodities. Other writers have focussed their attention more spe- cifically on the defense intellectuals6, the mass media (Aubrey 1982, Chomsky &amp; Herman 1979), war litera- ture (Wagar 1982, Clark 1966, Humprey &amp; Lifton 1984), the special cultural characteristics of the nu- clear imagination (Visvanathan 1984), gender rela- tions (Enloe 1983, Easlea 1983), the science-military technology nexus (Kaldor 1982), and the complex cultural factors at work in particular societies.7 In the broadest terms this research suggests it is necessary to be highly sensitive to the way thinking about militarization occurs in a cultural milieu partly produced by the processes of militarization. This is particularly apparent in the structure of public debate on questions of war and peace, which often takes on a highly ritualistic quality. Complex technical and poli- tical issues are obscured behind clichés and slogans. Constructive dialogue is swallowed up in hardline platitudes. This is also apparent in the more rarefied sub-cultures that specialize in military matters. While military strategists and specialists in international politics often pride themselves on their hardnosed approach to the supposed realities of interstate con- flict, their portrayal of those realities is thoroughly permeated by textual and interpretive codes. Whether in terms of the structures of public debate or the specialized discourses of military elites, the rela- tionship between militarization a cultural production cannot be ignored. The major challenges here con- cern the appropriate theoretical conceptualization of cultural production, and the need for more compara- tive research in a wide range of different societies. Important as this way of approaching the subject is, however, cultural analysis can also be invoked from a number of other directions. 2.2. Militarization and the Contradictions of Modernity In addition to the way in which emerging military structures participate in cultural production and reproduction in the modern world, they also have important implications for the value systems 53</page><page sequence="5">expressed by different cultural traditions. Cultural sociology gives way to more philosophical considera- tions. Here the emphasis is less on culture as a pro- duct than as the expression of philosophical, ethical and even theological options. Take, for example, some of the cultural values of Western modernity, particularly our claim to be part of a rational, progressive and civilized society. Look- ing backwards, we see ourselves in part as a product of the Enlightenment, the promise of emancipation from myth, superstition and barbarism. This was a promise of progress made possible by reason, science and technology. Uncertainties and contradictions arise once we recognize that our deadliest weapons are also a product of scientific progress. This has also been a century of total wars and mass exterminations. The prospect of nuclear war simply underlines a fun- damental tension between the promise of scientific reason and the threat of ultimate barbarism. The structures of contemporary militarism heighten still further the suspicion that the heart of our civilization and culture is not reason but irrationality and force. This suspicion has long been a re-interated theme of political, social and cultural theory.8 It is arguably one of the major cultural themes of the twentieth century. But with nuclear weapons, the tension between Enlightenment and Despair seems to be pushed to extremes. A similar line of thinking arises out of our self- understanding as a democratic society. The move towards democratic forms of politics has undoubtedly been one of the greatest achievements of our age. Nevertheless, theories of democracy usually come in qualified forms. One classic qualification involves the tension between political democracy and economic inequality. Another involves that between political democracy and the instrumental requirements of an efficient administration. A third set concerns the way in which questions of "state" and "national security" ought to be exempt from the unruly pressures of "public opinion". Different societies have struggled to resolve these tensions in different ways. They now find that they are becoming more troublesome as a result of the dynamics of contemporary militariza- tion.9 A number of themes are significant here. Nuclear weapons in particular have been linked to a growing sense of powerlessness on the part of citizens in West- ern industrial states. The scale of the forces at work, and the complexity and technical nature of the debates about appropriate policies, lead to a funda- mental withdrawal from participation in questions of life and death, a capitulation to expertise and specia- lists. Contemporary strategic debate is spectacularly arcane. Decisions are made - or at least justified - on the basis of esoteric forms of information which only a small elite can successfully claim to know. This is one realm of modern life that has been most receptive to the lures of a purely instrumental reason. This in turn involves a high degree of centralization in deci- sion making, a centralization that is reinforced by direct connections with specific economic interests. Contemporary military structures embody both a concentration of power and an acceleration of the translation of politics into technique and administra- tion. Not only is the state increasingly impervious to democratic pressures in this way, but the state itself comes to play an increasingly important part in the structuring of civil society. The "bomb", after all, is not a single inert object safely stored in its silo. It is a complex system involving research, production, pro- cessing, reprocessing, servicing, modification, and transportation, not to mention the structures neces- sary to preserve secrecy. The state intervenes in eco- nomic policy in order to "defend the national inter- est". It enhances its ascendency over the institutions of civil society under the same pretext. Consequently, the pressures that result from processes of militariza- tion seem increasingly likely to resolve the central contradiction between state and civil society in favour of the former. This is a resolution that necessarily undermines the state's claim to legitimacy as a guarantor of liberty and democracy, at least in those societies where this liberal distinction has been histo- rically important. A third example is provided by the concept of security, for contemporary forms of militarization also throw our understanding of security into serious questions. Unlike reason or democracy, security is a neglected category of political analysis. Where reason and democracy have been the subject of sharply con- tested interpretations and even political struggles, the concept of security has had a relatively quiet history. It played an important role in classic texts (like Hobbes' Leviathan) which sought to justify the legitimacy of the state in the early-modern period. And for the most part the claim that the state is in fact able to provide security for its inhabitants has been accepted. Most political thinkers have simply assumed security to be a given, and have then gone on to discuss more elevat- ed values like justice, freedom, community, and the like. Security has become the preserve of theorists of relations between states. The assumption that secu- rity means national or state security has thereby 54</page><page sequence="6">been re-inforced. But this division between life within states and relations between states embodies a very fundamental schism between the claims of citizens of states and the claims of human beings as human beings. These claims are intrinsically in tension with each other. And, of course, with contemporary mili- tary technology, the pursuit of security by states in the name of their citizens increasingly implies the inse- curity of all human beings as human beings. State security threatens global insecurity. The more secu- rity is defined in terms of the interests of the citizens of states, the more it is undermined for the inhabitants of the planet.10 None of these contradictions is novel. They may be said to be constitutive of the cultural and political tra- ditions of Western societies for a few centuries at least. But they are contradictions. The destructive power that is incorporated into contemporary military struc- tures makes them very tense contradictions indeed. As with the concept of war itself, it is no longer clear what we are talking about if we refer to reason, demo- cracy or security in the context of our modern capac- ity for mass self-annihilation. 2.3. Militarization, Cultures and Everyday Life Nuclear weapons have a universalist finality about them. They do not discriminate among the many cul- tural divisions through which we have managed to dif- ferentiate ourselves from each other. Similarly, no matter how the specific characteristics of military pro- duction and deployments are identified and under- stood, it is not possible to ignore their global scope. Modern forms of militarization have begun to cut across political and cultural boundaries. And yet one of the more striking characteristics of contemporary life is that the clamour for nuclear disarmament re- cently prominent within Western industrial states has had little resonance within other societies. Eqbal Ahmed (1985) has phrased the point quite succinctly: Since the mid-19th century, nearly every signifi- cant trend in the West - of the right, center, and the left - has been reflected in non-Western societies. Sometimes, as in the case of nationalism, Marxism and statism, the non-Western derivations have had as great or greater impact on modern history than their Western originals. The anti-nuclear is one of the rare Western movements to have had no in- fluence in the Third World - intellectually, politi- cally, or morally. An explanation for this is to be found in its own limitations. It is, in effect, a woe- fully narrow and parochial response to a universal challenge.11 Here the cultural horizons of our understanding of militarization take on the guise of ethnocentricism. Emerging military structures may well be global in reach. Nuclear weapons may well threaten species extinction. But these things are not understood or interpreted in the same way in different societies. Ethnocentricism, the projection of parochial assump- tions as universal categories, is not just a matter of cultural relativism. It also involves relations of pow- er. In this case, the emergence of global military struc- tures and even the possibility of global war, is characterized differently depending on ones location within the international political and economic order. For some, mainly in the West, the problem is posed by specifically nuclear weapons. Hope for the future is pinned on the achievement of nuclear disarmament. For others, the most pressing concern is the role of military force in maintaining repressive regimes or structures of international hegemony. Hope for the future is then seen more in terms of enlarging the scope of human rights or national autonomy. For others still, the concern is for immediate survival. The question of peace is seen as meaningless unless framed as a matter of economic well-being. Peace is interpreted through categories of development. This is not simply a question of different cultural or philo- sophical traditions suggesting different understan- dings of what peace and security might mean, although this is an interesting consideration.12 It is more that global structures of military power affect different people in different ways, leading to contrast- ing accounts of appropriate political action. The very diversity of forms of contemporary milita- rization might be great enough to inhibit effective theoretical articulation of the general processes involved. Yet the concept of culture itself provides a crucial insight into the underlying theoretical prob- lem involved here. In the European context, the con- cept of culture took much of its meaning from its his- torical association with the Romantic reaction to the cosmopolitan claims of the Enlightenment. The parti- cularist and subjectivist sensibilities of culture opposed the universalist claims of science and reason. To think of the processes of militarization in terms of cultural differences is to engage once again with the old dialectic of universalism and pluralism embedded in the concept of culture itself. On the one hand we can see a universalization of the problematic of milita- rization and an internationalization of the armaments culture. On the other, we can see significant diffe- rences in the way these processes are interpreted and resisted. But where this dialectic has so often led to 55</page><page sequence="7">the formulation of political options in strongly either/ or terms - states or world order, nationalism or cos- mopolitanism, tradition or modernity - the key ques- tion for a critical engagement with emerging pro- cesses of militarization concerns the possibility of act- ing in a way that recognizes both the universality and the particularity of those processes. Temporal and spatial considerations are important here. Nuclear war is usually posed not only in terms of universalist finality, but also as future event; as a con- vergence of present tendencies, perhaps, but never- theless a danger located at a time still to come. Yet it is increasingly clear that the problem is not only the pos- sibility of future conflagration but also the present and ongoing consequences that militarization has for people now living. This has begun to be obvious in two ways. First, we have become aware of the central role the military sector plays in the economic life of modern societies. The old 'third man' theme about war as the engine of human progress now takes the form of 'military Keynesianism'; the production of weapons of mass production is legitimized by the promise of greater employment, not to mention pro- fits. Again, this is hardly new, but the real human cost of the processes through which military production is integrated into economic life has become a matter of increasing controversy.13 Second, we have become aware of the immediate fear, alienation and sense of helplessness engendered by present tendencies (Lif- ton &amp; Falk 1982, Lifton 1979, Kovel). The work of a number of psychologists on children's attitudes to nu- clear war is particularly instructive here. In both cases, the conventional distinction between future war and present peace dissolves. Contemporary militarization has to be understood as a process occuring in both the future and the present. Similar considerations arise in terms of spatial cate- gories. Warfare is conventionally posed as a foreign affair arising from the external relations between states. This convention is deeply rooted in the major traditions of Western social and political theory. As with security, so also with the good of life - justice, legitimacy and freedom. These things are depicted as occuring within the spatial boundaries of the state. Relations between states, by contrast are characte- rized in terms of contingency, perpetual conflict and the clash of powers. War has been understood as phe- nomenon that occurs "out there" in the space be- tween states, a space of power and opportunism, of realpolitik, original sin and the pursuit of power and security at almost any cost. Of course this has always been an exaggerated view. Relations between life within states and interaction between them has always been a more complex matter of dialectical pro- cesses, contradictions, projections and penetrations than the conventional dichotomy allows. The distinc- tion has also been blurring for a considerable time as war has become more and more 'total'. But with the kind of militarization that seems to be emerging now, it becomes even more important to stress both the temporal and spatial immediacy of preparations for war, the contraction both from then to now and from there to here. We cannot escape the fact that war is an intrinsic part of our everyday life. We live in a world, a civilization, in which the preparation for war has become embodied in everyday practice and institutio- nalized as bureaucratic routine. 3. Militarization, Language and Discourse Language is arguably the heart of any cultural proc- ess, so it is not surprising that the relationship be- tween militarization and language has recently become the subject of a growing critical literature. As one might expect, primary attention has been direct- ed to language in the context of the relationship be- tween militarization and cultural production. Here the changing rhetorics of mystification and propa- ganda have been of particular interest. But there has also been some concern with the way particular words and discourses embody, obscure and disclose some of the key cultural contradictions of Western modernity. It is also possible to see how these words and dis- courses imply a specific location for critical political practice. In all three contexts, language reflects and constitutes significant horizons within which we understand and respond to contemporary processes of militarization. Here I want to suggest briefly one way in which a sensitivity to language enables some connections to be made between the three styles of cultural analysis that I have drawn on here. Language is a medium of both communication and mystification. Therein lies much of its political power.14 At the simplest level, politics offers consider- able scope for the use and abuse of euphemisms, jar- gon, metaphors, clichés and what George Orwell called 'doublethink' and "newspeak". Some of the lin- guistic ploys that have accompanied the accumula- tion of nuclear weapons are now well known. There is a jargon of sterile technologism through which mas- sacre turns into 'collateral damage'. Other jargons de- flect our attention through allusions to theatre and sport, or the use of anthropomorphic, animal or 56</page><page sequence="8">mythical names. Some terms have gone through a complete reversal of meaning. The destabilizing MX missile has become the 'peacemaker'. Secrecy and force are justified in order to 'defend democracy'. Exhortations are made about 'peace through strength' or joining the peace movement through joining the army. More systematic research has uncovered a wide range of linguistic usages through which our under- standing of contemporary military affairs has been fil- tered. Paul Chilton, for example, has examined early attempts to describe the bombs that exploded on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Chilton 1982, 1985). Reports by eye witnesses were couched in terms of "awe-inspiring" religious images. Very soon, press reports were expressed in terms of the power of nature or the revelation of the secrets of nature. The mushroom cloud became a symbol of vast mysterious power. The whole event was quickly assimilated to natural or supernatural processes and thus located beyond human control. The language was more appropriate to the experience of scientific discovery than of mass annihilation. Metaphors have also played an important role in this context. Glenn Hook has written of how the metaphor of a "nuclear allergy" has been used to undermine resistance to nuclear weapons in Japan; the metaphor portrays a political position as an illness to be overcome by careful treat- ment (Hook 1984. See also Hook, PRIO 1984 and Hook 1986). Similarly, tendencies towards political neutralism have often been dismissed as an unfortun- ate case of "Hollanditus". Many who oppose the accu- mulation of nuclear weapons also persist in using sim- ple-minded medical metaphors. The language in which modern weapons deploy- ments are portrayed requires particularly careful exa- mination. As noted earlier, the term "arms race" is especially misleading. Similarly, the term 'deterrence' brings with it meanings and implications that both elucidate and obscure what is going on. Consider, for example, the way deterrence theory incorporates the term 'balance', as in balance of power, which can mean both preponderance (as with a bank balance) or equilibrium. This difference is crucial to the debate between deterrence and war fighting schools of nu- clear strategy. In conventional military terms, the more and bigger, the better. For classical minimum deterrence, enough is enough.15 Similar ambiguities arise from the use of terms like "modernization", or the depiction of strategic deployments quantitatively rather than qualitatively. The prevalence of "nukespeak", as such usages have come to be called, does not exhaust the impor- tance of language in this context. Indeed, as some of the terms already mentioned may suggest, what is important here is less the linguistic characteristics of particular words or the propagandists intentions of specific usages than the discourses about military affairs in which particular words and intentions parti- cipate. Two terms with very deep historical and cul- tural roots are particularly suggestive here: the 'ene- my' and 'peace'. The concept of the 'enemy' invokes a very complex theme within Western culture concerning 'the Other'. This theme comes in many forms, from the dialectical logic of master and slave to the projections of psychoa- nalysis. In its crudest forms, a manicheism prevails; we have truth, reason and God, they have supersti- tion, barbarism and the devil. This theme is familiar enough in many of our categorizations of the so-called insane, in the social construction of gender, and in relations between the West and the rest whether this has been the Ottoman Empire, the Soviet Union, or the Third World.16 It has been particularly pro- nounced in the recent rhetoric of the Cold War. The wider implications invoked by references to an enemy are closely related to the highly problematic nature of the concept of peace. Here problems arise from false distinctions between war and peace in an era in which preparations for war are an increasingly important aspect of peace-time activity. Problems also arise from definitions of peace as the mere absence of war, or from attempts to reconcile peace with other cherished values like 'justice'. But perhaps most significantly, our commonest understandings of the meaning of peace in Western societies embody conceptions of universalism that reflect a culturally specific philosophical tradition. Most obviously, peace has been associated with claims to unity, with universalist claims about the priority of order over conflict. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant is sym- bolic in this respect. With Kant, the possibility of peace is explicitly linked to the realization of uni- versal reason. This connection in turn grows out of a commonly perceived philosophical tradition that goes back to classical Greece. In fact, the conceptual opposition between war and peace reflects a wider philosophical discourse in which the moment of unity or identity is linked with the good, the true and the beautiful. Diversity and difference are then treated as the inferior negations of these privileged values. And, of course, whether one understands this cultural tradition in terms of the rise of secular rationalism, or of the convergence of rationalism with religious 57</page><page sequence="9">monotheism, the postulation of a single moment of unity, identity and truth allows for a sharp distinction between those who can and those who cannot claim to have access to it. A concept of peace that is firmly attached to extreme universalism easily permits a rapid slide into a manichean world of friend and foe. In short, to examine terms like enemy or peace is to recognize the depth and complexity of the broader discourses in which specific linguistic meanings are constituted. Manipulative rhetoric and propaganda become less important than the capacity of such dis- courses to generate and limit our understanding of the way the world is, and even to specify the options avail- able for the world to become. Something like Michel Foucault's (1979, 1978) analysis of the discourses through which our understanding of madness and sexuality have been constituted, is therefore called for here. The examples of the terms "enemy" and "peace" also suggest that the starting point for any such analy- sis must be the way our understanding of modern military affairs is caught up in a culturally and histori- cally specific discourse dominated by a sharply dicho- tomized account of the relationship between the prin- ciple of identity or unity and the principle of differ- ence or pluralism. I have argued elsewhere that it is precisely this account that informs the most influ- ential modern theories of international politics (Walk- er (forthcoming), Walker 1984a, 1984b. See also Ash- ley). More specifically, it underlies both the contrast between political realists and political idealists, and between forms of political realism informed by a sense of history and change (Machiavelli) and those informed by a structuralist account of inter-state rela- tions (Hobbes). This account has predisposed ana- lyses of change in international politics to pose possi- bilities for the future as either a tragic continuation of the same old game of power and war or a historic leap towards a universalist global community. It is not immediately obvious that this either/or choice is war- ranted by the historical evidence or by the indicators of current trends available to us. Nevertheless, this formulation continues to have a powerful grip on con- temporary thinking about international politics. It informs both textbooks and policy prescriptions. And it is clearly visible in public debate between "hawks" and "doves" on military issues, at least in the North American context. A critical assessment of these pre- dispositions is essential. These discourses constitute one of the most power- ful expressions of the connection between culture, broadly conceived, and emerging processes of milita- rization. On one level, they can be understood as par- ticipating in the processes of cultural production. They generate popular images and meanings as well as inform the interpretive codes of specific research communities. On another level, they reflect, and ob- scure, deep tensions within the dominant cultural tra- ditions of Western modernity. Our thinking about the nature of war and the possibilities of peace, for example, is frequently structured by an underlying tension between the philosophical principles of iden- tity and difference. It is not difficult to show that the limits to our understanding of reason, democracy, and security are implicated in similar tension. On a third level, they reproduce assumptions about the location of human identity and political action. Where modern forms of militarization demand great- er and greater attention to their impact on both global structures and the local activities of everyday life, these discourses reproduce a vision of politics as either the presence or absence of the state. Unfortu- nately, while the state has long been the form of politi- cal community that has been able to claim legitimacy and obligation precisely because of this capacity to provide security for its citizens, contemporary forms of militarization have begun to turn the state into a primary source of insecurity. It is in terms of the theory of the modern state, therefore, that the connec- tion between culture and insecurity must be estab- lished most clearly. 4. Insecurity and Political Practice The discussion so far has surveyed a number of ways our understanding of contemporary forms of militarization is caught up in the complex webs of our inherited cultural assumptions, ongoing cultural practices, as well as our linguistic usages and discur- sive structures. The relationship between militariza- tion and cultural processes is felt all the way from the slippery rhetorics of militaristic propaganda to the philosophical assumptions that inform attempts to comprehend militarization within more systematic theoretical categories. I have argued that in addition to the more obvious connections between militariza- tion and cultural production it is necessary to exam- ine how contemporary forms of militarization inten- sify still further some major tensions within the cul- tural traditions of modernity that have been proble- matic in political life for most of this century. They also put into question our capacity to resolve these tensions within the political structures of the modern 58</page><page sequence="10">state and states-system. At each level, it is possible to specify possible implications for political practice. The implications of the connection between milita- rization and cultural production are perhaps the most straightforward, at least in principle. They suggest the need for a cultural politics of resistance, and the dele- gitimization of militarization through cultural activi- ties. This can involve satire and ridicule, as in the case of, say, Dr. Strangelove, or attempts to emphasize the sheer horror of war, as in the genre that goes back at least to Tolstoy's War and Peace. It requires skill in the decoding and démystification of rhetorics, and the clarification of the hard realities - both military and economic - behind the cultural forms. At a second level, militarization can be linked both to the tensions within the cultural traditions of West- ern modernity and to the sophisticated discursive structures about war and peace that have arisen within these cultural traditions. On the one hand, this suggests the need for a cultural politics aimed at unco- vering these tensions. That we live in a society that claims Enlightenment but advances barbarism, that claims democracy but enhances the secret state, that claims security but accumulates the power of mutual suicide, are fundamental points that demand constant exposure. On the other hand, there is the need for a cultural politics aimed at defusing the dominant dis- courses about war and peace. In the Western context these discourses reflect a heritage of Western rational- ism. Consequently, the critique of militarization ine- vitably becomes trapped in the familiar logic of iden- tity versus difference, order versus conflict, universa- list community versus pluralist conflict. This logic issues in the co-optation of dissent and the continued legitimation of present practices. Hence the crucial importance of refusing any simple dichotomization of the claims of identity and difference.17 Where militari- zation is often justified by the claim that human socie- ties are different, and therefore inevitably in conflict, and where opposition to militarization coalesces on propositions about the essential unity of human existence, it now seems necessary to stress the claims of both unity and diversity as a starting point for any formulation of more peaceful possibilities. Both levels lead on to the third, and it is here that the most important issues arise. In this context, the relation between culture and militarization appears as a reconstruction of the horizons of human identity. On the one hand this is felt as an expansion, a recogni- tion of the global structures in which we all partici- pate, whether we wish it or not. On the other it is felt as a contraction, a fusion of the most global structures with the minutest activities of everyday life. Yet this occurs at precisely the same time that the currently most powerful focus of human identity - the state - is becoming ever more powerful. In the more prosper- ous societies, processes of militarization seem to be enhancing the power of the state at the same time that the state is less and less able to justify its claims on human identity. In less prosperous societies, the state retains legitimacy in part because of its role in resist- ing more powerful states. It does so by entering fur- ther and further into the structures of militarization that render human security in general increasingly problematic. Perhaps the sharpest way of posing these connec- tions between culture, insecurity and the state is in terms of the broad problematic announced by the term "bureaucracy". It is here that many of the themes raised so far begin to come together. In the context of cultural production, questions of war and peace now engage very large bureaucratic institutions. Where it is tempting to analyse modern weapons deployments through general theories about the logic of deterrence or the determinations of technological innovation, it is often much more ins- tructive to enquire into the detailed analysis of the bureaucratic routines and rivalries that mediate spe- cific decisions.18 One of the most interesting issues here concerns the way modern military-bureaucratic structures reach out into a very broad sector of the intelligentsia. In the American case, for example, we can point to the symbolic early case of the Rand Corporation, the development of deterrence theory by ex-economists, and the proliferation of research institutions and uni- versity research projects dependent on defense fund- ing. Conversely, modern American social theory con- tinues to reflect an understanding of social life through metaphors and models stimulated by mili- tary research, as with cybernetics, game theory, opera- tions research and systems analysis. Here it is possible to analyse the relationship between particular bureaucratic institutions and the more general pro- cesses of cultural production and reproduction. It is also possible to examine the specific way in which policy is constituted through particular discursive structures. But the problematic of bureaucracy is not only a matter of administration or the institutional apparatus of the modern state. It is also a theme concerning the trajectory of politics in the twentieth century. As announced by Weber, this theme is double-edged. Rationalization has become the defining characterist- 59</page><page sequence="11">ic of Western culture and socio-economic life. Yet ironically, rationalization, particularly as manifested in bureaucratization and industrialization, produced more efficient ways of realizing specific goals only by neglecting the fundamental values which guide human conduct. In this context, contemporary patterns of militari- zation appear as a particularly depressing footnote to the theme of the iron-cage. Whether as the fate of Western civilization or as the peculiar technological domination characteristic of capitalism, the bureau- cratization of mass murder confirms a grand philo- sophy of history. It is, of course, a philosophy of his- tory that has long been troubled by the problem of political practice. Weber's own formulation is the most troubling of all. For Weber, the escape from the snares of rationalization is provided by the nonrati- onal and quasi-existential commitments of indivi- duals in a world of inevitable conflict, whether be- tween individuals or nation-states. It is an appeal that serves to resolve the paradoxes of Weber's own moral universe but which merely amplifies the contradic- tions in his own cultural heritage.19 History as rationa- lization issue in a politics of the irrational assertion of power. In the late twentieth century, power politics offers little escape from rationalization. It promises only its probable completion. The connection between bureaucracy and the state occurs both as institution and as philosophy of his- tory. To invoke the name of Weber is in both cases to portray the connection in the most pessimistic way. No theory of the processes of militarization can avoid an account of the participation of state bureaucracies in both the strategic and economic aspects of modern processes of militarization. And it is at the level of the state that the contradiction between Enlightenment and Despair occurs as the abandonment of reason in favour of irrational power in its most dangerous form. It is also in relation to the state, whether as labyrin- thine institution or as national power, that the ideolo- gical role of cultural forms is strongest and the coun- ter-hegemonic potential of cultural politics seems weakest. A less pessimistic conclusion emerges from the third reading of the connection between culture, inse- curity and the state. Here the crucial point is that the patterns of contemporary militarization suggest that the state no longer has a monopoly on the provision of security. The state itself is viewed increasingly as a source of insecurity. And this insecurity is now felt acutely both in terms of the grandest of global struc- tures and of the minutiae of everyday life in local communities. It is precisely these two contexts that are excluded in favour of the state by the discursive traditions that have dominated thinking about mat- ters of war and peace. They have been treated as mutually exclusive realms, as political analogues of the philosophical principles of identity and differ- ence. The state has continued to monopolize the terrain of security precisely because it has been possible to appeal to abstractions like national interest - abstrac- tions that reify both the moment of difference be- tween communities and the moment of identity within communities. Whatever layers of complexity are added to this basic reification by the specific cha- racteristic of cultural production in particular socie- ties, it is this connection between security and the state that has become increasingly vulnerable. That insecurity is now felt both locally and globally is not only a danger; it is also an opportunity for redefining security in ways that stress both its local immediacy and global reach, thereby undermining the legitimacy of contemporary processes of militarization at the core. In the context of the contradictions of Western modernity, the recognition that insecurity is felt both locally and globally acts so as to undermine the very discourses in which those contradictions have long been embedded. The tension between Enlighten- ment and Despair is itself a form of the reified opposi- tion between identity and difference. Weber is symp- tomatic in this respect. The conventional progressi- vist view of history is deprived of its capacity to attain some universal truth. Meaning and value are denied the possibility of any universalizing integration and are then distributed to the relativism of pluralistic and irrational decisions. Because identity is denied, differ- ence is embraced. The impossibility of their reconci- liation then takes the form of the tragic view of history that has guided so many appeals to realpolitik in this century. Contemporary forms of insecurity suggest that all this is based quite simply on a false bifurca- tion. In fact, we have common insecurity which mani- fests itself in quite different ways. It is a matter of us and them. In this context, therefore, there is consider- able space for deconstructing and reconstructing the discourses and traditions that reproduce a view of security as us or them. The recognition that insecurity manifests itself simultaneously in both global and local forms is of particular significance for the cultural politics of human community. Historically, the state has been the political form through which the projects of secu- 60</page><page sequence="12">rity and of human community have converged. The paradigm of this convergence has been the nation- state. Contemporary forms of insecurity put this convergence into question. If those who claim to be realists are right in suggesting that human communi- ties are in the end rooted in the search for security, then we should expect an increasing concentration of political activity at both the local and global levels. The interesting question that then arises concerns neither the priority of the one over the other, nor the necessity of resolving the claims of unity and identity with those of particularity and difference in an eternal reification of the state; but rather the way in which political space is likely to be disarticulated into a variety of different levels both above and below the state. The relations between culture and insecurity thus appear in the form of cultural production, in the form of discursive articulation, and in the form of political practice. In the last case, the key moment now involves the exploration of new forms of political community and identification, and of the possible connections between them. If there is to be a space for creative politics in the face of the kinds of structural determinations that induce the bureaucratization of mass murder, it is these connections between com- munities responding to different forms of a shared insecurity that will have to be explored and encour- aged.
