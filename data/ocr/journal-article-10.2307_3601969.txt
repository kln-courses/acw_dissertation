AUGUSTIN GLUCKSTADT</page><page sequence="3">PREFACE This volume contains a selection of the Late Geometric and Protoattic pottery, including all the figured pottery, found in the Excavations of the Athenian Agora before 1960, as well as a sampling of contemporary imported pottery. The Submycenaean, Protogeometric, Early and Middle Geometric pottery which precedes it will be published separately by Evelyn L. Smithson. Conventionally, all the Geometric material should have been treated together, but the pottery itself seemed to speak in favor of taking the Late Geometric phase with the Protoattic. The argument is as follows. The mass of the pottery of the 11th through the 7th centuries was made within a fundamentally conservative craft tradition against which all in- novations, revivals and survivals must be viewed to be appreciated. The more these products of mere craftsmanship are studied in all their detail, the more they appear to evolve slowly and imperceptibly, like generations of natural creatures; that is to say, the period styles and tech- niques cannot be sharply marked off one from another. One event alone provides a clear-cut inception of a period: the appearance of a painter of sufficient personal distinction to enliven the whole craft. Such a painter did appear in the middle of the 8th century. This was the Dipylon Painter who brought to the fore that full figure style which was developed in Protoattic to become the distinguishing feature of classical vase painting. Once he had come on the scene, a lively crowd of easily distinguishable Late Geometric painters immediately followed. Hence his floruit, the earlier phase of Late Geometric, seemed the proper prelude to the Protoattic period, while the careful, conservatively anonymous Middle Geometric pottery that immediately preceded the products of his activity appeared as the last of a purely geometric tradition. The Agora deposits mirror this division in their relative volumes; the amount of Middle Geometric is small and groups illustrating the transition to Late Geometric are rare, while there is a sudden plethora of Late Geometric groups. The lower terminus for this volume, the third quarter of the 7th century when the Protoattic semi black-figure technique turns into full black-figure style, was fixed in accord with current practice; the division is supported by the appearance of classical black wares toward the end of the 7th century. The precise divisions were settled in discussion with Mary Zelia Philippides, Lucy Talcott and Brian A. Sparkes who are working on this later Agora material. Most of this study was written in 1958-1959, while I was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, on leave from St. John's College in Annapolis. I am most grateful to Professor Homer A. Thompson, Director of the Athenian Agora Excavations, for the opportunity to do this work, and for his patient and interested support of it, and to Lucy Talcott for all kinds of invaluable help. All of the photography for this volume was done by Alison Frantz; the watercolors and the ink drawings of Nos. 339, 401, 426 and 577 are by Piet de Jong and the topographical drawings are by John Travlos. Warm thanks for years of fruitful collaboration go to my colleagues in the field, Evelyn L. Smithson and Jean M. Davison. ATHENS EVA T. H.

There is something, and often something of special interest, for every quarter century, but one would not wish to write a general history of the pottery from it alone. Indeed, that is not the purpose of a volume devoted to excavation material, and the following sketch is therefore not about the Late Geometric and Protoattic Periods, but about such pieces of pottery of these periods as happen to have been found in the Athenian Agora Excavations.' It will seem that this pottery in part fits into the generally known corpus of pottery of those periods, in part has its own special character; just enough background material to make this clear will be introduced. The familiar arrangement of the discussion of pottery under the aspects of shape and painting is retained here. Shape is usually taken first, for it is, in fact, first, both because no pot can be painted before it has been made, and also because the painting must accommodate itself to the shape; yet there is much more to be said about the painting; hence the very unequal lengths of these sections. SHAPES The condition in which the Agora pottery was found has allowed a convenient division of the presentation into Plates 1 to 13, on which are illustrated whole pots with minor decoration, and Plates 14 to 41, which show fragments decorated with ornaments or figures. This condition of the Agora pottery is easily accounted for; most of the whole pottery comes from house wells into which the simple utility pottery had dropped during use or had been thrown when and where it broke, while the fragments of fine pottery which stood in sanctuaries or cemeteries had to travel farther before they came to rest in a deposit and are therefore much more scattered. Plates 1 to 132 have been set up to tell their own story as clearly as possible. The pots have all been selected from published and dated groups, except that a few unpublished parallels have been added. Variants have been avoided with a good conscience, for these appear in the detailed group publication. As far as possible each quarter century is represented by one pot. In the Catalogue a summary of the development of each shape precedes the descriptions of the individual pieces, so that only general remarks appear here. Not all shapes make equally good series. Some shapes show no development at all, namely those which are foreign to the Athenian potter and which are simply copied from some non- Attic or non-pottery prototype. Such are the Subgeometric aryballoi (P1. 4, 65-71) and the cup with the angular shoulder (P1. 10, 188). Furthermore very insignificant shapes, like the Subgeometric oinochoai (P1.4,57-64) and the banded jugs (P1. 5, 87-90), show no development. Other shapes are produced only in variants, as it were. These are for the most part pots not in daily use but made for special purposes, such as funerals and other rituals. Among them are the pyxides (P1. 15),a egg-shaped kraters (P1. 5) and kantharoi (Pls. 10, 30). 1 For previously published material of these periods see Brann, Burr and Young in Abbreviations and Bibliography. References to Agora material to be published in other volumes of the Agora series are made by inventory numbers which may be found in the concordance of each volume. 2 The arrangement of shapes is the conventional one: first closed shapes, then open shapes; within these major divisions vessels of standard size and with two handles are put first, i. e. amphorae, hydriai, oinochoai, bowls, plates, skyphoi, cups; last of all come the coarse ware and imports. 3 For these there is the additional explanation of their basketry origin, see p. 14. I</page><page sequence="12">2 INTRODUCTION The shapes most profitable for illustrating a development or formulating its principles are those which were serviceable and much in use, such as storage jars (P1. 2), spouted bowls (P1. 6), skyphoi (P1. 8), cups (P1. 10) and cooking ware (Pls. 11, 12) which change slowly but steadily, further, those which are made in rivalry with a lively and distinctive foreign series, like the kotylai (P1. 9). Cups (P1. 10) give a singularly good picture of a smoothly changing series of proportions; first their height grows progressively greater in relation to their diameter, and then the trend is reversed. Other shapes, like the spouted bowls (P1. 6), have a similar history, but because of the difference in the absolute sizes of the bowls the development is less obvious. A clear evolution in general proportions through the late 8th and early 7th century emerges from a survey of these series. In the mid-8th century, the period of the Dipylon Master, pots were produced in proportions which appeal immediately as standard and well balanced. For instance, the Sub-Dipylon amphora 2 (P1. 1), the cup 177 (P1. 10), the amphoriskos 250 (P1. 15), the skyphos 135 (P1. 8), the kotyle 153 (P1. 9), all have a relation of height to greatest diameter or, in the case of the open shapes, of greatest diameter to height, of 1:1.4-1.8. (This is in the vicinity of the "golden section" i. e., the proportion in which a smaller dimension has to a greater the ratio which the greater has to their sum, which is, in numbers, approximately 1:1.6.) In the latter part of the century the diversity characteristic of Late Geometric decoration is echoed in the shapes. Suddenly all is variety; examples are the amphorae (P1. 1) and the oinochoai (P1. 4) which come with bases of many different sizes, the skyphoi (PI. 8), and the cups, partic- ularly those of Phaleron style (P1. 10). Soon a trend toward depth and slimness appears, which prevails completely over these experiments at the turn of the century and lasts well into the 7th century. In the amphorae this elongation had begun before the middle of the 8th century (6, 7, P1. 1, represent it in the third quarter), but it now reaches an extreme in amphorae like 12 (P1. 1) in which the neck to body relation is almost 1:1 and which is more than twice as high as it is wide; these are consequently often referred to as loutrophoroi. In addition, kotylai (P1. 9, 155-156), spouted bowls (P1. 6, 98), Subgeometric skyphoi and cups (Pls. 8, 137-138; 10, 181-183) clearly show this attenuation which is in keeping with the taste for the strained and mannered observable in the figure painting of the time. It is characteristic of the 7th century that the shape and painting style are strikingly related, not that the painting is particularly designed for the shape, but rather the spirit is the same, for instance in the case of the Pair Painter and the Kynosarges Painter.4 Perhaps some craftsmen learned both to throw pots and also to paint them. Whether this trend is inspired by the Protocorinthian kotyle series on whose similar development from broad and low to steep and thin rest whole chronologies,5 or whether it is a purely Attic phenomenon, is not clear. One would suspect the latter, as a proper complement to the precious quality of contemporary painting. As the 7th century passes its midpoint, a return to more standard proportions may be observed; the best examples are the amphora 19 (P1. 2), the spouted bowl 100 (P1. 6) and the cup 184 (P1. 10). This balance coincides with the highpoint of 7th century painting in Middle Protoattic, but it is only a passing phase on the way to new excesses, namely those of the low-slung broad pots of the later 7th century B.C. Again spouted bowls, skyphoi and cups (Pls. 6,101; 8, 134, 140-142; 10,186-188) best display the change. All these pots have a diame- ter which is close to double their height. Particularly the metallic-looking cups like 186 (P1. 10) have a remarkable similarity in size, enough to show that while the potters of the period did not work with a measuring stick or a template, they nevertheless had certain sizes and pro- portions clearly in mind as desirable. Analogous excesses in painting can be seen in the Attic magnification of Protocorinthian style. * See pp. 24-26. 5 See p. 5.</page><page sequence="13">SHAPES 3 It is worth noting that the two extremes of steep and squat fall into the beginning and end respectively of Protoattic; so also do the two periods when the potters were expecially sus- ceptible to the influence of metalwork; see the metallic skyphoi and Phaleron cups of the late 8th century (Pls. 8, 143-146; 9, 150-152; 10, 189-193) and their later 7th century counter- parts (Pls. 8, 134, 147-148; 10, 186-188). The difference between the two series is that the late 8th century examples are merely copied from metal shapes, while those of the late 7th century suggest metal by their fabric as well as their shapes. To go from proportions to contours: the Agora has no whole large pots of the best Geometric period; the reconstruction of the Dipylon amphora 1 on Plate 1 is taken from the amphora Athens N.M. 804 and demonstrates once again the difference between the taut contours of the mid-8th and the more lax and more varied lines of the later 8th century B.C. Kahane pointed out that the contours of the parts of earlier Geometric pots complement each other so that the concave curve of the neck is repeated in the convexity of the body.6 In the Late Geometric and earliest Protoattic periods the neck curve is usually much weaker than that of the body and sometimes the neck is actually slightly conical with a broad base and a narrow top so that the neck and the body are equalized at the joint; this can best be seen in the oinochoai (P1. 4, 52-54). On the amphora 10 (P1. 1) the cone shape of the neck is emphasized by the concentric triangles in the neck panel. Plates (P1. 7, 115-116) show a similar loss of articulation. This liking for flaccid contours results, appropriately, in the invention of the neckless olpe shape (Pl. 5, 82-86). In the 7th century two opposite lines of development appear. One shows itself in the drying out and shriveling up of the Subgeometric trailers of the Geometric shape repertoire. Thus the Subgeometric skyphoi (P1. 8) are actually smaller than Geometric skyphoi, besides losing all counter curves. Just when the Subgeometric shapes have reached a low point the new black-glaze technique saves them; their dryness is turned into metallic crispness, and their plain-painted schemes profit from the use of the fine new glaze. This can again be seen in the skyphoi as well as in the cups and the little oinochoai (Pls. 8, 142; 10, 186; 4, 63, 70). The other line is the Protoattic trend proper. It appears most clearly in the fine ware amphorae and storage jars (P1. 2) and in the spouted bowls (P1. 6). It moves away from the Geometric, that is, away from regularly curved and "constructed" shapes to plant-like and "organic" shapes. Typical Protoattic pots look, in fact, like beets; see especially the amphora 24 (P1. 2), the standed krater 95 (P1. 5), the spouted bowl 100 (P1. 6). It is in this unrefined earthiness that they differ from their Mycenaean predecessors, while they resemble them in their plant-like contours and high centers of gravity. A 7th century invention in this spirit is the neckless or one-piece amphora (P1. 2, 21-22). Both this amphora and its counterpart, the olpe, are the very shapes which become the bearers of that Protoattic invention which is most important to black-figure composition, namely the picture panel (578, P1. 37; 544, P1. 33).7 It is not hard to see why the need for so forcible a way of delimiting the decoration as the picture panel would first be felt in painting a shape of one curve, especially since Protoattic painters, in clear distinction from their Mycenaean prede- cessors, generally prefer to follow Geometric principles in putting decoration on a pot, i. e., the zones of decoration have a clear relation to the parts of the pot, and their main direction (apart from the natural lines of plants and figures used in them) is that of the two axes of the pot. Last of all, a word about the handmade, unpainted cooking ware and water pots (Pls. 11, 12).8 Here the effect of technique on taste is plain to see; before the 8th century the cooking jugs and jars are heavy and ungainly, but sometime during that century the potters acquired the trick of building pots which were thin-walled, yet sizable. The pottery immediately assumed 6 A.J.A., XLIV, 1940, p. 471. 7 See p. 26. 8 See p. 29 for the fabric. 1*</page><page sequence="14">4 INTRODUCTION more capacious, even contours, crisply finished rims and feet, and tauter rolled handles instead of band handles. These larger pots were suitable for use as well-dippers, and so bails and pourers-kadoi, hydriai, oinochoai-were now made of this fabric. Their simple, full, unbroken lines were, of course, more the result of a favorable combination of fabric and function than of deliberate craft; still, no pots more properly pots were ever made, and an argument for some endemic Attic sense of form might well begin by referring to this ubiquitous early coarse ware which owes nothing to either wheel or brush. The potters who made fine ware seem to have appreciated this, for they patterned some of their leading shapes on the water pots. For instance, the one-piece amphora which first occurs with Subgeometric decoration and later becomes the characteristic black-figure amphora has the kados (P1. 11, 195-202) as a likely prototype. In the 6th century, with the increasing refinement of the cooking ware, there are several more obvious borrowings of this kind. A fairly detailed description of shape development naturally produces questions of a fun- damental kind. In particular, how do "trends," "developments," "series" of objects which are neither biologically nor mechanically nor logically related come about at all? These phenomena can of course be explained in part as the result of habit and inertia on the part of the potters and their apprentices: a master set a norm, then varied it a little in the interests of elegance or piquancy; the apprentices attempted to preserve the trick and overdid it. When the varia- tion became excessive the trend was reversed if the shape was indispensable, or the shape was abandoned. Still, neither the norms, nor the graph-like regularity of some shape developments, nor the genesis of a successful line is explained in this way; even a hypothetical explanation is lacking.9 A similar question concerns the relative speeds of development of the different aspects of style; it is, for instance, a curious fact that black-figure painting begins earlier than the plain black ware, that the painting style is fully established before the shape repertoire has become fixed; in this volume the plain ware lines run regularly through the last quarter of the 7th century while the figured pottery stops at ca. 620 B.C. A good illustration of this discrepancy is the spouted bowl 101 (P1. 6) which, though itself still belonging to the pre-black ware series, has a parallel which bears full black-figure decoration.'0 Perhaps the Agora series will prove useful when the problem of the morphology of artifacts is studied.

Cook in his two funda- mental articles." As Cook's delineations of periods and painters can be filled in with new detail, his sequences and time allotments are again and again confirmed. A list of dates so confidently set forth in such detail requires, however, some explanation of the method by which it was built up. Our dates are, as it were, strung along the path of time on a very few primary supports, which occur where, in some usually far from straightforward way, certain pots in a series can be connected with dated historical events. Luckily such a support exists in one of the most crucial periods, namely in the transition from Late Geometric to Early Protoattic. Pottery of these styles is found in conjunction with Protocorinthian and this, in turn, is found in western Greek colonies for which Thucydides gives founding dates. In the complicated associations by which actual dates for actual pots are derived, one fact must be taken on faith-that in each case the im- ported pottery found on a dated western site includes some of the earliest. Dunbabin has reviewed all the evidence and has shown that pottery dates so derived are fairly fixed, give or take a quarter century, and that they can in principle never come closer unless new and more direct evidence is found.12 The Protocorinthian shape most relevant for dating Agora groups is, in the unlucky absence of aryballoi from 8th century deposits, the kotyle. Kotylai have been found at Cumae and Syracuse which have fairly well fixed foundation dates, and similar kotylai or their Attic copies occur in Agora groups (P1. 9). The kotylai have a clear and consistent development. A Late Geometric low, round-walled skyphos of the kind copied by 153, and dated at ca. 740 B.C. by its context, is the predecessor. The Protocorinthian kotyle series proper begins in this spirit with fairly rounded walls and becomes progressively more straight-sided; a kotyle from Cumae 11 Protoattic: B.S.A., XXXV, 1934-35, pp. 165-219. Late Geometric: B.S.A., XLII, 1947, pp. 139-155. More details and more bibliography are given in the introductions to Brann E-H and I-R. 12 T. J.

Help may also come from Asia Minor, especially Gordion.</page><page sequence="16">6 INTRODUCTION is among the earliest of the series and is dated ca. 725 in accordance with a foundation date of ca. 750 B.C. Others more advanced in the same direction may be dated into the last quarter of the 8th century ;a13 the Protocorinthian 155 corresponds in stage to these latter and is dated accordingly. (In these reckonings no provision need be made for a lag between Attic copy and Corinthian prototype, for the Agora groups in which both are found together show that they keep even pace.) None of the chronological systems in use'4 diverge more from each other than Dunbabin's latitude of a quarter century either way. This means that a more detailed dating rests entirely on opinions concerning the speed of development of Attic pottery, according to which smaller stages between the dated points d'appui can be paced out. When early pottery was only known by period styles, this was a highly subjective procedure and tended to give the longest time to the liveliest periods, since the different competing styles were all strung out in sequence. Now that different painter personalities and workshop ways can be distinguished, a much more accurate estimate of the pace of development is possible. The numbers in the date chart are shorthand expressions for just such feeling about pace. Especially in the 8th century they should all be prefaced by "within a quarter century either way." From the 7th century on the penumbra of uncertainty shrinks. This is because the next main support in our chronology is much more direct and much less unsteady; it is the dating of the earliest Panathenaic amphorae to the reorganization of the Panathenaia in 566 B.C. In the pacing of development external evidence sometimes corroborates the impressions gained from style. So, for instance, R. S. Young's opinion that the Late Geometric development was very quick and that the pottery from the Late Geometric cemetery could not cover more than two generations was confirmed by the anthropological analysis of the skeletons.5 So also a later dating of Middle Geometric which resulted in putting the Dipylon style around 750 B.C. and which seemed advisable for stylistic reasons is supported by a later dating of Proto- geometric which is based on quite different considerations.6 The best guarantee for the chart is, however, that it yields a plausible painter sequence which corresponds with the development of the concurrent local plain ware and the contemporary imported pottery. It is, oddly enough, in Late Protoattic that the stylistic history of the 7th century is most vague," while in the middle quarters of the century the case is clearer. The masters at work in the mid 7th century are distinct and few and their products are not so subtle or so various as to obscure the clear line. Furthermore, securely dated Corinthian imports are found together with pieces by known Middle Protoattic masters. To select a few cases of central importance: 1) an aryballos dated to the middle of the second quarter of the 7th century was found with the Kerameikos Mug Group.'s 2) a running dog aryballos (Brann S 19) of the kind dated by Payne to a little before 6501' was found with work of the Ram Jug Painter (540-541, P1. 33), middle period. Since it is here held that the Kerameikos Mug Group may be by the Early Ram Jug Painter, this association is particularly welcome for it serves to confirm the closer dating of the Protoattic middle period where considerations of Attic style alone had already placed it. 3) Protocorinthian pottery which points, all in all, to ca. 640 B.C.20 was found with Kyno- sarges work. 13 See Corinth, VII, i, nos. 107, 123, which respectively precede and follow Johansen, V.S., pls.

Anz., LVIII, 1943, col. 418, figs. 44ff.</page><page sequence="17">DATING 7 But sometime in the late third quarter of the 7th century Attic painters ended the even develop- ment of their outline style by outright adoption of Protocorinthian types of figure and ornament. These Late Protoattic works can not, nevertheless, be exactly matched with their Proto- corinthian sources, for the Attic renditions have the spirit of new conceptions. Furthermore, early Attic sculpture complicates the picture by providing alluring comparisons, so that the pottery falls heir to all the difficulties attending the dating of the sculpture.21 These circum- stances explain why no single piece of Late Protoattic can be neatly fitted into a framework. On the chart the Woman Amphora (578, P1. 37) has been put ca. 630 as against Diepolder's 620 B.C. to express its nearness to the outline painting of the mid-century. The fragment by the Woman Painter (581, P1. 37), who is Beazley's first black-figure painter, has been dated to 625 B.C. as being by one of the earliest Attic successors to the techniques of the Proto- corinthian period. 625 B.C. would therefore seem to be the most reasonable terminal date for Protoattic. The dates of the sparingly decorated or undecorated pottery which contributes the clearest shape sequences come from the closed deposits in which the individual pots were found. These deposits are published separately in detail with an explanation of their dating.2 A brief further note on the use made of such deposits seems necessary. Agora deposits which are useful for dating because they were at some particular time sealed off from contamination are of two sorts: first, groups of offerings placed in graves, and second, accumulations of pottery in well-shafts. In the Agora hardly any of these groups had any stratigraphical relation to each other.23 The difference between the two kinds of groups is this: the pots in a grave were purposely assembled in antiquity and are thus likely to be all of the same date, often even from the same workshop, from the shelves of which they had been bought especially for the funeral. A well filling, on the other hand, would be likely to be collected from local trash heaps, and so would, at the very time of dumping, consist of a gradual and random accumulation of great variety, including both household pots and scraps of fine ware. The major work which dealt with amazing success with the definition of styles of the Geo- metric period, namely Kahane's,24 was based on grave groups only, for no wells were available at the time. There is, however, a double danger in characterizing the whole pottery product of a time by the single-stranded sequence of small groups. First, since in theory at least the firm linking of successive groups depends on each group having some earliest and some latest pots, which must be paralleled by the respective latest and earliest pots of the group before and the group after, there is a natural tendency to make small and rather similar groups cover a good deal of time. But the facts of manufacture suggest a different picture; for the sake of economy large lots of pots, painted by different hands, were fired together. These were then put on the potter's stock shelves and the mourning family selected its offerings just before the funeral, only occasionally adding an heirloom.25 Secondly, speculation on the basis of small groups or single pots is apt to result in emphasis on Periods or Tendencies which are thought to be expressed by isolated items, but which when seen against a background of bulk appear as some workshop's specialty or as a potter's private knack. Here the well groups provide the necessary 21 See E. B. Harrison, Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, p. 303. Many of the above-mentioned difficulties will disappear with the publication of the Vari pottery by S. Karouzou. 22 See in the Bibliography under Brann, Burr and Young. The provenience of those pieces in the Catalogue of this book which come from closed deposits is noted after the inventory number, so that the reader may consult the description and date of its context in the Deposit Summary. pp. 125-131. 23 A general description of the graves and wells themselves, i. e., how they were made and filled, is included in the Topo- graphical Indications, pp. 107-108, 111-113. 24 A.J.A., XLIV, 1940, pp. 464-482. 25 See Hampe, Grabfund, pp. 46, 72.</page><page sequence="18">8 INTRODUCTION balance. They are large and variegated, yet the contents can usually be shown to be con- temporary, that is to say of the same conventional quarter century; some of the pots can be linked with dated series, so that the rest of the plain pottery in the same group can be safely dated by association. Furthermore, some early and late stragglers are usually distinguishable, so that a particular well can be put in a series with earlier and later groups. And since the span of time covered by such groups is likely to be a long one, it becomes much harder to mistake and reverse the time sequence. In addition cross references from shape to sequences of painting style can often be made; they prove the sequences to run parallel and to corroborate each other. Here are a few examples of cross references which are not so involved as most: 1) The Phaleron jug 52 (P1. 4) can be dated to ca. 700 by comparison with similar examples from Phaleron graves containing Protocorinthian; also it is from the Oxford Workshop, dated to ca. 700 on stylistic grounds. 2) The spouted bowl 101 (P1. 6) can be dated to the last quarter of the 7th century by its context; also it duplicates the shape of the Nessos painter's Harpies bowl which is dated similarly on stylistic grounds. 3) The Attic kotyle 512 (P1. 31) has the shape and ray-height of kotylai from contexts of the third quarter of the 7th century, and it also comes from a workshop thought on stylistic grounds to be functioning at that time. 4) At various points the Attic kotylai which, as illustrated on Plate 9, keep even pace both in dec- oration and shape with their Corinthian prototypes (P1. 9, 155-158) supply excellent check- points with the non-Attic series. Thus the well groups give at the same time both a broad and a detailed basis for dating.

This is due to the work J. M. Cook, Hampe, Kahane, Kunze, Nottbohm and lately J. M. Davison, to mention only those who were interested specifically in discovering workshops and masters.29 This kind of effort is successful in doing the pottery justice because it is based on the simple but important proposition that people and not periods produce pots and that even in pre-archaic times there were individual craftsmen, a fact to which Hesiod's KEpaPEVOS KEpalPEi KOTrEl bears witness.30 The references in the Geometric part of the list of attributions are mostly to Davison, "Geometric Workshops," because that study contains both pictures and a full bibliography.

Coldstream commented on such lists that the best test would be to try them on a collection of excavation pottery-if they were made up mainly according to the facts, much of the pottery should be assignable, and conversely many of the painters and shops should be represented. When tried on the Agora pottery, the lists have proved to be mainly right. The Protoattic part of the lists needs no such apology, for although it took nearly fifty years from the time when Boehlau first recognized the period until Cook, Eilmann and Gebauer almost simultaneously distinguished several generations of painters,31 the main oeuvres are now generally accepted. It was really to be expected that the Agora pottery would fit well into the general picture, for it comes, after all, from the center of production. As a matter of fact, several of the painters we know must have had their shops, or at least an outlet, in the Agora area itself; for instance the Workshops of Athens 894 and Athens 897 supplied the neighborhood with sets of funeral pottery and well-dippers, and the Sub-Dipylon shop sold its large but somewhat low-grade grave markers in this area. For the 7th century we even know the exact location of the fabricants of a group of knickknack pottery decorated with a great deal of applied red.32 The Pair Painter (P1. 36) as well was probably a local man, for none of his pots have been found outside the Agora. LATE GEOMETRIC POTTERY Attic Late Geometric pottery bears the first full-fledged Hellenic figure decoration, and it is. probably not wrong to say that the Dipylon Master was responsible for it. Some of the figured pottery called Middle Geometric is indeed earlier than his work, though there is much reason to think it nearly contemporary,33 but even if he does not introduce figure decoration he first constructs truly "Geometric," that is to say canonical, figures and tableaux. The main painters that follow are all his heirs. The Agora has scraps from this master's hand (= 245, Pls. 1, 14) which are part of the disiecta membra of a grave amphora like Athens 803 and 804.** Only tiny bits of the prothesis and of the chariot procession are preserved, but even so the ornaments which he has perfected, 27Fauvel on seeing Dipylon pots in 1813, quoted in F.

Furthermore there is the fragment of the neck of a similar Dipylon amphora (246, P1. 14) which comes from a more elaborate amphora than the two whole pots, Athens 803 and 804, neither of which has panel decoration on the neck. The panel motif, a wheel flanked by rearing serpents, begs for interpretation, but in vain. There are many such wheels on Geometric pots (at the Agora 128, 246, 269, 287, 320) mostly on pottery of the Dipylon period. Earlier, in Middle Geometric, concentric circles with central crosses were standard panel-filler (296, 297), while afterwards the Late Geometric followers make a more cursory ornament of the meticulous Dipylon wheel (P1. 17). It seems to be generally agreed that the wheel represents the sun disk.35 It is often attended by birds as the inhabitants of the heavens, but rarely by snakes who are guardians of the underworld. Whether the Dipylon Painter intended the complementary forces of life and death with this motif, and what efficacy he expected it to have when painted on the pot, is not, of course, revealed when the general origin of the motif is determined. It is true that Dipylon ornament has an air of being more readily interpretable than the work of earlier or later painters, but whether this is because the painters of the Dipylon period were better versed in such lore or simply because they painted more carefully is not to be determined. In the Protoattic period, on account of the painter's predi- lection for sports and improvisations, the distinction between ornament and symbol becomes even more vague. Thus the type of the double animal which is derived from the two animals flanking the sun36 seems to occur on an Early Protoattic neck of the delicate style, (426, P1. 26). Yet this charming double doe has the air of a Jeu d'esprit, a push me-pull you. The facing ducks on 549 (P1. 34) have also been interpreted as solar birds, though again they do not look in the least hieratic. Perhaps the case of some very accomplished modern Geometric painters, the Pueblo Indians, is applicable: some of their painters do not know what they are painting though they are quite sure how they must do it, while others can give the meaning of every part of their design, even though it turn out to be a fine fictional account made up for the inquiring archaeologist.37 The fragmentary condition of 246 draws one's attention to the detail in a way seldom possible with whole pieces and allows one to admire a craftsmanship equally flawless over five feet or five inches; it is, of course, characteristic of this painter that his art is his craft. It takes just one century before another man wields a brush like that, the Middle Protoattic Ram Jug Painter who inherits this tradition which can be traced back to the Dipylon Master via the Early Pro- toattic Analatos Painter, the Late Geometric painter of Athens 894 and the Sub-Dipylon Hand. The Dipylon Master is the first painter to give evidence of the orientalizing influence that touched Athens in the 8th century.38 One imagines that he took his kneeling goats from such easily brought and easily lost curios as oriental sealstones.39 A small work, an oinochoe with a doe in the neck panel (249, P1. 14), shows Dipylon con- ventions and therefore probably comes from his workshop. A number of similar pieces are known.ao The group of grave offerings from the Late Geometric cemetery, shown on Plate 15, is the richest one of the Dipylon period known to date. It is from a woman's grave, and since it was among the oldest in the burial plot, it may well belong to the wife of the patriarch of the 35 See A.J.A., XLIV, 1940, pp. 443-456.

Some of the pots in it, e. g. the miniature grave marker (250, P1. 15) copied from black amphorae of severer style,41 look earlier than those of the Dipylon master, while other pots again look later, like the skyphoi which are close to the Late Geometric; the grave is certainly well advanced over the Middle Geometric graves,42 and is at most a shade earlier than 750 B.C. Its furniture may well be imagined to come largely from one workshop, though this figureless pottery made to be sold in sets represents the still anonymous element in Geometric. On Plate 16 are represented some of the craft features of Geometric pottery. The oinochoe neck and the krater fragments (270, 285) show incision in the Late Geometric period. The circles on the neck may well have been made by such a tool as was used in bronze or ivory working.43 The incised lines on the krater were made to separate the banding which a careless painter had run together. It is likely that just such little tricks, the use of some handy tool from a craft like ivory or metal working where incision was traditional to make an ornament or to correct careless painting, prepared potters to accept incision in figure painting; 44 the purely decorative use of incision on coarse ware was, of course, in full swing in 8th century Athens (P1. 40). The small pot 271,made by pressing clay into a finely woven basket, illustrates the connection of pottery of the Geometric period with basketry.45 The knob 272 comes from a Middle Geo- metric pyxis lid. It is illustrated together with a knob of turned wood to show how closely it simulates the appearance of the latter and how much it looks like the kind of knob a basket might have. H. A. Thompson has shown that the pyxis shape itself and also its Geometric decoration originate in basket work;46 he points out especially the many Geometric designs which arise naturally in plektonic technique: running friezes of zigzags and maeanders,47 checkerboards,48 and radial designs on the bottoms of the vessel.49 A proof of basket prototypes for some of the most important Geometric shapes and motifs is more important than it might at first seem to the appreciation and the history of the pottery.50 To begin with, it explains an uneasiness felt by many writers about the relation of the decor- ation to the pot itself. For it has been noted that the Geometric pot has, as it were, two envelopes to its volume, its clay wall and its ornamental cover, but this is, of course, exactly what is one and the same thing in a basket; the problem of adjusting these two elements to each other was not so much presented to the potters and painters by their potter's craft as imported to it by them from basketry. The Middle Geometric pyxides most clearly of all shapes show basketry origin in both their shape and their decoration,51 and it is possible that at the time they were made baskets were on 41 Like A.J.A., XLIV, 1940, p. 476, pl.

Hampe, Friihe griechische Sagenbilder in B6otien, Athens, 1936, pl. 30, top right. 44 Note, too, that the earliest full-fledged incision in both Corinth and Athens is outline incision, intended to sharpen the outline of painted silhouettes (e. g. Payne, PK Vasen, pls. 9-11, Ktibler, Alt. Mal., pls. 41-43). 45 Baskets are also copied at this time without being actually used to make the pot, (e. g. CVA Munich 3, pl. 121, 2-4). 46 In a study summarized in A.J.A., L, 1946, p. 286, and on file at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey. The analysis is given validity by the fact that the basketry products of various peoples are considered. A similar study is L. W.

Robinson, St. Louis, 1953, Vol. II, pp. 1 ff. 4 Because the design must be worked all round at once. 48 Formed from the crossing of warp and woof of different colors. 49 This effect arises from the crossing at the bottom of the warps around which the woof is planted and which are then turned up for the sides, see 268 (P1. 15). 50 The importance of the technique in forming style was first thoroughly treated by G. Semper, Der Stil, Munich, 1878; see especially Vol. II, 1879, pp. 33ff. 51 Signs of it are evident from Late Protogeometric on, e. g.

This might partly account for the comparative rarity of Middle Geometric pottery. The rest of Plate 16 shows fragments of Geometric kraters. The progression 273, 282, 286 leads from late Middle through Late Geometric. 273 is one of the most delicately varied bits of the period extant, an example of Middle Geometric miniature style used on a large pot. 282 has the same decoration as the kantharos 173 (P1. 10); both are of the third quarter of the 8th century and illustrate the occasional reappearance of Mycenaean decoration on Late Geo- metric pottery which begins contemporaneously with the first orientalizing signs. 286 has a typical Late Geometric circle motif but also decoration reminiscent of Protogeometric;52 Proto- geometric archaizing is quite frequent at this time, see 37, 72, and 152. The Sub-Dipylon Workshop is represented on Plate 17. This workshop was so named because, while its chief hand is very close to the Dipylon master, the workshop uses his types and his mannerisms with all the slackness of Late Geometric painters. 287 is by the Sub-Dipylon Hand himself; its prototype is a master amphora like 246. 289 and some similar sherds show the degeneration of circle-in-panel amphorae in this shop. The neck 303 is a more creditable example of the shop's work on which the typological similarity of the Sub-Dipylon stallions with those of the Dipylon master53 can be seen-note especially the strongly arched chest-and also the falling off in quality. The oinochoe 304 is the piece of Agora Geometric most often illustrated, not indeed for its beauty-it is from the Sub-Dipylon Workshop-but on account of its intriguing construction and its narrative frieze. The curious crossed hollow tubes which were passed through the body (Fig. 2) remain unexplained; the frieze has been plausibly interpreted as a rendition of an episode from Iliad XI, namely Nestor's triple combat with the Actorione-Molione who were Siamese twins.54 They appear united behind a square shield (detail, P1. 17) fighting off a single warrior, Hector. What Sub-Dipylon painting loses in discipline, it gains in narrative power. Even if the interpretation of 304 and of the workshop's Theban krater as illustrating the Rape of Helen55 remains mere conjecture, in short, even if these scenes are not identifiable, they are still distinctly particular as against the wholly undifferentiated funeral scenes and chariot parades of the Dipylon Painter.56 Only two other Late Geometric picture scenes come from the Agora. One is a near-Protoattic sherd (311, P1. 18) showing a man who lifts a little boy with long locks by his calf while a peplos figure raises her arms and another man comes running; this may well be the moment described in the Little Iliad when Neoptolemos seized Astyanax "from the bosom of the fair- haired nurse, and taking him by the foot, cast him from the tower." The other is a somewhat doubtful cattle-rustling scene on an oinochoe panel (340, P1. 20): a helmeted warrior appears to be running off with a cow while another throws a stone at him. A crowd of Late Geometric hands, each with its own mannerisms, is represented among the Agora finds. The Knickerbocker Workshop (332, 334-335, P1. 19) produces thick, close tapestry- 52 Desborough, Protogeometric Pottery, pl. 3, bottom right. 58 E. g. CVA Louvre II, III H b, pl. 1. 54 See R. Hampe, Friihe griechische Sagenbilder, pp. 87-88. The interpretation of Geometric pictures from literature remains, of course, conjectural no matter how much circumstantial evidence is adduced; that lies in the very nature of Geometric genre painting; see Hanfmann, A.J.A., LXI, 1957, pp. 71-72; also Webster, B.S.A., L, 1955, pp. 38-50; Kirk, B.S.A., XLIV, 1949, p. 149. " See Davison, "Geometric Workshops," p. 67, fig. 98, for the attribution to the Sub-Dipylon Workshop; Hampe, op. cit., pp. 78-79 for the interpretation. 56 Two rather different ways of describing this crucial change: Beazley, Dev., p. 4; KiUbler, Alt. Mal., p. 8. What weight must, in accounting for it, be given to internal stylistic development, outside influence and new ways of seeing, and how, indeed, these terms are to be precisely understood remains quite open. This is where the truly interesting art-historical problem begins.</page><page sequence="26">16 INTRODUCTION like decoration; the painter makes one fairly feel the nap of the tapestry on the surface of the pot;". . . a surface which was all design and no field, one might perhaps say a texture, was his objective."'7 An earlier group (325-331, 333) of the mid-8th century gives more the impression of engraving and is indeed fluted in imitation of metal work. Other painters are recognizable by the funny little animals they make their trademarks (P1. 18):58 a hybrid goat (321) standing on pudgy hind legs and crouching on stick-like forelegs is in the Hirschfeld manner; some long-necked does (307) are reminiscent of the Knickerbocker Workshop; two shark-mouthed lions with loop ears (316) are by the Lion Painter. A goggle- eyed horse (324, P1. 43) belongs to the Benaki Painter while another (322) is closely related; the heads of a rearing horse team (315) are from the Workshop of Athens 894. The Vulture Painter is conspicuously absent; a frog (369) is adespoton. One Late Geometric Workshop predominates, that of Amphora Athens 894.59 Amphora 336 (Pls. 1, 12 and 19) from a funeral pyre is a good example of the products of this shop. The painting is even laxer and the figures even livelier than on 304. This workshop makes smaller pots, frieze for frieze, than its predecessor, and succeeds in compressing the looseness charac- teristic of all Late Geometric drawing into a mobile dumpiness. Its liveliness expresses itself in a pleasure in variety; though the vase is small there are two figure zones of different content and scale on each side of the neck (detail, P1. 19) beside the chariot frieze of yet an- other scale (detail, P1. 19) on the body; each zone is separated by several bands of different ornament, and plastic snakes are draped over the neck, the handles and the shoulder. The neck panels have highly circumstantial vignettes of a prothesis. The three-man procession on the back is discussed below.60 The other neck panel, probably thought of as the front, contains the prothesis. At the left a large woman tears her hair, another on a smaller scale stands on a stool at the head of the bier, tearing her hair with one hand while touching the corpse with the other, and a third woman writhes below the bier. The bier has big bolsters, and a checkered pall is draped "over" it, almost like yet another ornamental zone; at its ends and over the dead man hang wreaths. Checkerboard, crisscrossing or zigzagging cover the figures and little worm lines crawl over the field. This whole scene is 8 cm. wide. The other pots from the pyre61 were made in the same shop and show a variety of shape equal to that seen in the painting. A standed saucer (337) marks the introduction of the runner- tondo into Greek painting. A pair of miniature standed cauldrons (338 is one of these) which are copied from metal prototypes and which have plastic birds and snakes on their rims, when considered together with the many other plastic objects from the group, give rise to some speculation concerning the influence of the coroplast on the painter. Geometric painting always lags in naturalism behind the contemporary plastic art, such as impressed gold bands, ivories and bronzes.62 This is true also of terracottas, for plastic horses appear regularly on pyxis lids before they are common in painting, while some animals, such as stags, bull heads and even frogs,63 occur in plastic form before they are painted at all. Furthermore, a remarkable kind of terracotta sculpture made in the earlier Geometric period 57 From the English typescript of Payne, PK Vasen, quoted in Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, p. 313. 58 See Davison, "Geometric Workshops," passim, for these. 59 bid., pp. 41-45, figs. 33-39. o60 P. 112. 61 Young XII. 62 For the lag in gold bands see Ohly, Goldbleche, p. 105; for the Dipylon ivories Hampe, Frilhe griechische Sagenbilder, pp. 36-38, pls. 31-32 (i. e. though found with Late Geometric pottery they must be compared to Early Protoattic painting); for the bronzes, Willemsen, Ath. Mitt., LXIX-LXX, 1954-1955, pp. 15-32, Beil. 1-18 (the bronzes he discusses are schematic- ally close enough to Geometric vase figures to be proved Geometric, yet they had hitherto been dated much later because of their modelling). 63 Stag vase: Matz, Gesch. Gr. Kunst, pl. 23; bull head on pyxis lid: CVA Athens 1, p. 1, 9, the prototypes are bull protomes on bronze cauldrons; frogs, also on pyxis lids: Kerameikos, unpublished; 869 has a painted frog some half century later.</page><page sequence="27">LATE GEOMETRIC POTTERY 17 survives in three pairs of plastic boots and two leg-shaped handles of bowls.64 These boots are close to nature, but they are not mere copies of leather originals, nor mere clay shoes. They are, rather, subtle renditions of shod feet showing the beginnings of that counterplay of body and cover which is admired later in Greek sculpture. The legs with full calves and hose-like decoration show a similar quality. These potters were fairly advanced coroplasts who could, where they were not bound by tradition, see quite ungeometrically. The lag of painting behind plastic art is not, after all, very surprising. Painters were more tradition-bound not only because they had a craft tradition probably lacking for clay modelling, but also because their medium is in fact further removed from life since it lacks the third dimension. The potters in their second capacity as coroplasts were therefore likely to have had an encouraging effect on the painters, who, in working for them, became used to renditions in the round and to new subjects. The main painters are, in fact, known to have worked for potters who copied bronze vessels and decorated them with plastic figures ;65 338 is a sample of this cooperation. The Painter of Amphora Athens 897 ran an industrious but unimaginative shop contemporary with that of Athens 894. He is represented by an amphora (11, P1. 1) which is all zone-dividing ornament and by an olpe (83, P1. 7). There are also some workshop products like 84 = 359 (Pls. 7, 21) which has a rabbit chase (P1. 43); some of these seem to be distinguishable as by one hand, which is called the Stathatou Hand (341, 343, 360, P1. 21).66 This shop was very prolific; in fact its output comes near to mass production. It specialized in water bailers (neckless banded pitchers which it sent as far as Italy67) with coursing hounds and grazing does, all dashed on by practiced hands. Plate 21 also shows various other coursing hounds, a motif well suited to the cursory Late Geometric style. On 346 a wave band has been converted into a hound, thus merging the two favorite Subgeometric motifs. Plates 18 and 21 together demonstrate the decline of an old Geometric motif into its degenerate Subgeometric state, namely the bird-in-panel ornament, especially as it occurs on oinochoai necks (362-366). Like many other Geometric ornaments and decorative schemes, it is carried into the 7th century in this low form. A group of little pots and terracottas (367-368, P1. 21; 271, P1. 16) were probably made on the side in some potter's shop and adorned with the same apprentice's scribble. Curiously, 368 was a grave offering in the same child's burial as the flawless Dipylon work 319, thus showing that the latter can be contemporary with Subgeometric. The shoulders of spouted bowls (see P1. 6 for complete bowls) make fine fields for animals and especially for ships; presumably the thought of the liquid within called them to mind. The largest one is 339 (P1. 20) which has a vignette of a herd of long-horned bulls on the back, a display of this form of wealth which had become unusual since the Mycenaean period. The horns, un- like the crescent-shaped frontal views of the few other Late Geometric representations, are shown in true side view.68 The horses and the coursing hound under the spout are close to those of the Workshop of Athens 897. 370 is a fragment from a bowl of similar style. The ship kraters (P1. 22) are all Early Protoattic. One shows an empty ship with its oarlocks; the other ships have marines on board who sit sheltered behind their shields leaving the oars unmanned (383), or double as rowers (382); these latter figures are shown in awkward but obvious three-quarter 64 Boots: Hesperia, XVIII, 1949, p. 287, pl. 70, 22-23; legs: Burr 6. 65 See Hampe, Grab/und, pp. 45ff. for the Workshops of Athens 894 and the Analatos Painter; for the 7th century see the Kerameikos polychrome group, Arch.

In the 7th century ships disappear almost entirely from Attic pottery.69 Early Protoattic too is the warrior-and-chariot bowl 301 (Pls. 17, 43); it belongs to the slapdash school of reaction against Geometric sobriety.70 EARLY PROTOATTIC PAINTING The Workshop of Athens 894 is the main Late Geometric workshop; the Analatos Painter (P1. 23) is the first and the main Early Protoattic painter, and he was trained in the workshop of Athens 894.71 This is perhaps the place to inquire how and in what form Attic painters came to take up the "orientalizing" style. Payne wrote: "The new style did not come to Greece as an idea: it was a lesson learnt from imported works."72 This is true in a special way for the Athenians, to whom the style came not indeed as an idea, but not quite as an object lesson either, since they probably received a very modest share of the imported treasures.73 The new motifs must have come to them largely at second hand, through Corinth, for fairly accurate, that is direct, renditions of oriental prototypes in painting are rare.74 All this makes it very unlikely that the Athenian painter could have had any clear intention of orientalizing, that is of conjuring up either oriental shapes or meanings. The Protoattic spirit probably owes very little to the Orient; one in- dication of this is the curious fact that in the 8th century, when Athens was more in touch with the East than any other mainland city,75 her painters did their most consummate geo- metric work, while their breakaway to natural forms came at a time of incipient provincialism, late in that century. The imported oriental motifs did not so much shape as meet the new taste for patterned growth and stylized violence; there would have been some sort of Protoattic style even without them. In fact, even those few creatures which were not, like men, horses and birds, plainly indigenous both to Attic nature and to Attic art already appear in the Attic repertoire well within Geometric times, and they have but weak orientalizing antecedents at the very outset.76 This is true, for instance, of lions; once they appear, they have a connected Attic history. The Geometric lions (316, P1. 18) are simply a number of lion-indices collected in a sil- houette-teeth and tongue, claws, tail-curl. Later lions usually raise one front paw; this convention has its origin in early lion-and-prey groups (385, P1. 23, perhaps 401, Pl. 43),77 which show the lion swiping at his victim. In the course of Late Geometric the lions' contours fill out (374-375, P1. 22), and in Early Protoattic they are recognizably feline (400-401, P1. 23; 550, P1. 34). In this period their heads are usually reserved, which allows the painter to add some stylized natural features such as dots for the roots of whiskers and feline ears, though every painter varies these a little for each pot.7 What these lions looked like in the round is 69 See Kirk, B.S.A., XLIV, 1949, p. 120. The inference that the Attic navy had come to grief is not altogether far-fetched, for, unlike creatures, artifacts are painted only if they play a part in daily life. 70 Cf. the Hymettos amphora, CVA Berlin 1, pls. 43-44, where even the shape is affected. 71 See Davison, "Geometric Workshops," p. 45. 72 English typescript of PK Vasen, in Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, p. 313. 73 Nothing oriental of the late 8th or 7th centuries has been found at the Agora, and little anywhere else in Attica, though the Early Protoattic cauldrons in Mainz may have been partly copied from imports; see Hampe, Grabfund, p. 48.

At the turn to Middle Protoattic, the so-called panther type, a frontal-faced lion, is taken over from Protocorinthian (461, P1. 28). The Middle Protoattic lions (Pls. 33-34) are close to Cycladic types which are best suited to Attic outline painting; toward the end of the period Protocorinthian types come in (565, P1. 35; 576, P1. 37) together with the black-figure technique. Mythical creatures are not so common nor so various on Attic as on Corinthian vases. Centaurs appear in Late Geometric and are in point of style indigenous (487-488, P1. 29); the Agora may possess a fragment of an Early Protoattic battle of centaurs (433, P1. 26). Early Protoattic painters otherwise confine themselves mainly to sphinxes (P1. 26), presenting various and garbled versions of the oriental prototypes79 which they use and abuse so as to merge them into the Attic background. Winged horses are more rarely seen; 489 (P1. 29) is among the earliest. The importance of Mycenaean revivals may, on the other hand, have to be re-emphasized.80s The Athenians certainly often came across Mycenaean antiquities,8' so there would have been no lack of models. Certain common Late Geometric shapes like the spouted bowls and low cups (98 ff., P1. 6; 186 ff., P1. 10) are distinctly reminiscent of Mycenaean shapes; besides, Mycenaean motifs sometimes show themselves strikingly in details of vase painting,82 and even in the overall decoration as on 173 and 282 which have vertical as opposed to Geometric horizontal banding. The Analatos Painter (P1. 23) must then be thought of as a Geometric painter with advantages, namely, sufficient but not overwhelming outside stimulation and a tradition which had begun to move. He has adapted the two distinguishing features of Protoattic style, orientalizing plant ornament (396) and partial outline painting (390, 398-400), but he also retains the old filling ornament and full silhouette figures, often on the same pot. For his animals too he has both a Geometric and an advanced type, especially for his horses (Geometric: 387-389; advanced: 396-397). In spite of this bilingual vocabulary, his personal style is unmistakable. His figures are no longer the oddly powerful little puppets set in an atmosphere thick with fill ornament found on Athens 894, but trim, smoothly moving creatures from whose contours the fill orna- ment is carefully kept away. While he takes the first steps toward a more natural rendition of the bodies by glossing Geometric over-articulation,83 he brings faces closer to nature by more differentiations; whereas the profiles on amphora 336 (P1. 19) consist of a bulbous forehead and a lantern-jaw, the charioteer on his 390 has a little nose and a mouth in addition, and each horse opens its mouth just to show that it has one. At the same time he has something fine- drawn and spidery, especially in his horses (396), which marks him as a Geometric mannerist in part; furthermore he often still uses the firm and even Geometric paint rather than the weak but colorful Protoattic.84 A late phase can be distinguished in the work of the Analatos Painter.85 It is represented in the Agora by some near-miniature fragments (398-399), rather repetitive lions (400-401, 550, 79 See Kunze, Bronzereliefs, pp. 248ff. for Attic adaptations of oriental types. so80 J.

A sphinx fragment (535, P1. 33) shows that he painted into the earliest phase of the Black and White style. Some very delicate painting (hydria 384, P1. 22; egg-shaped kraters 498-499, P1. 31) must be the work of someone very close to the Analatos Painter; the hydria has a neck frieze close to that of the Analatos hydria and an Analatan horse in the panel beneath the vertical handle, though the human profiles and details of ornament differ. More will be said below of this delicate style. There are also crude followers (414-415, P1. 24; 448, P1. 27). Of these the charg- ing rider type on the oinochoe goes back to the Analatos, Painter's teacher;86 the amphora simply abuses Analatan types while the sherd blows up its natural size. Another contemporary work in contrast with the delicate hydria is a heavy, boldly colored hydria neck 416 (P1. 25). It is one of those artless works in which it is hard to tell whether the effect is intended, but it looks as if the women were raising their faces in song. The neck is close to the Mesogeia Painter's work. The Mesogeia Painter (P1. 26, top) is a lesser contemporary of the Analatos Painter. They have some things in common; for instance both paint on an early form of bell-krater (391-393, P1. 23; 420-421, P1. 26), both use a fine brush, and both like knitted ornament, the Analatos Painter lattices (393-395) and the Mesogeia Painter netting. But the Mesogeia Painter is at once more wooden and more outre with his fool's cap helmets (418), round sphinxes' heads (422) and Pinocchio faces (321). The transition from Early to Middle Protoattic is characterized by extremes; among these are extremes of size and what seem almost intentional disparities of style. Striking contrasts of contemporary delicate and crude works have been noted above for Early Protoattic but now there is actually a forking of the main styles in this sense. The painters of the delicate style study outline painting on a petite scale (P1. 26, lower half), while the painters of the Wild Style (411-413, P1. 24; 470, P1. 28; 490, P1. 29), show a slapdash exuberance and mobility that comes from being rid of Geometric discipline without having to wrestle with a delicate new technique; instead they splash on copious white and sometimes red paint (410). The Black and White style expresses this same mood. It too appears already in Early Proto- attic (416, 421) and it is used mostly to heighten the effect of outline painting. This reaction to the Geometric silhouette is peculiarly Attic, for in Corinth and Crete white is used for line drawing or for detail. It is perhaps not pure accident that the style is represented in the Agora only by small scraps (450, P1. 27; 468, P1. 28), for its products may have been made mostly in a branch workshop on Aegina.87 The only larger piece found in the Agora must be one of the last of the plastic snake hydriai with choruses (417, P1. 25). Its ornament is borrowed from Proto- corinthian ;8 the incision comes to a few misplaced scratches, and the figures are drawn bumpkin- faced, with an awkward attempt to render the bosoms in side view. And yet the clear com- position of three women between two tendril bushes, uncluttered by fill ornament, and the bold countercoloring save the piece; it is young rather than crude. On Plate 28 are fragments from very large pots representing the transition from Early to Middle Protoattic. Several of these sherds show the soft, chalky fabric and the light, almost pastel-colored paint which distinguishes Protoattic from Geometric finds. Most of them have parts of the weird apparitions which result when painters are no longer content with essentials and not yet adept at details; e. g. 456 has a fierce open-mouthed head with a helmet of which even the noseguard is drawn; 458 shows great warriors with wispy beards and decorated shields, and 460 has the hairy leg of a huge beast. The Painter of the New York Nessos Amphora is typical of this weird phase and scraps in his style are easily recognizable (461, 463, 465-466). 86 Cauldron, Athens 810, Hampe, Grabfund, p. 53, fig. 36, workshop of Athens 894. 87 Ktibler, Alt.

Both are the heirs of the Late Geometric Vulture Painter89 who is himself strongly under the influence of the Cycladic Linear Group. Their older colleague is the Analatos Painter, with whom they occasionally worked and who influenced their styles. The N Painter loves cocks. His appear to be the earliest in Athens and though he may have got the idea of using them from Early Protocorinthian, the type is his own. Both the cocks and his little ibexes are delicately drawn in partial outline. He, like the other Early Protoattic painters, uses in his later work the color alternations which develop into the Black and White style (437). The Passas Painter's work is close to his, but more scraggly. For the Painter of the Kerameikos Mug Group (439-440, P1. 26; 537, P1. 33) the delicate style has become a near-miniature style. Both his ornament and his figures have clearly Analatan antecedents; he even paints an Analatan mourning woman on the ceremonial gown of one of his own mourners.90 Since he links the Analatos to the Ram Jug Painter, he will be mentioned again with the latter. 1MIDDLE AND LATE PROTOATTIC PAINTING Plates 29-32 illustrate Protoattic varia, mostly of the middle period. There are Protoattic birds (P1. 29): swans (478, 480), a pelican (479), ducks (549, P1. 34), and various others, long- necked and crested, of huge and tiny size. Nothing brings home better the painters' new eye for nature than a comparison of this aviary with the dreary, schematic birds of Late Geometric (P1. 21). The swan fragment 478 comes from the cylindrical stand of a large lustral basin which was perhaps supported by plastic women of whom only one pair of feet remains. A splendid marble basin of this date found at Isthmia has such an arrangement.91 The olpe 492 (P1. 30) is a delightful oddity of the beginning Middle Protoattic style. The band on the body is a very primer of Protoattic improvisation, for it contains not one composition, but a collection of ornaments capriciously conceived but lovingly drawn: two labyrinthine maeanders, one with an entrance and the other closed off, a bush of drooping rosette flowers, a "tree of life" composed of tiers of lotus buds with a finial, and a pair of prancing, neighing horses. The whole is an Attic improvisation on Island style, particularly Cretan, but the eminently Protoattic shape of the olpe (which was in fact used as a well-dipper) shows that it is not an import; it merely reiterates the close connection of the delicate style with the Islands. "Island influence" will be alluded to here and there and needs to be explained. The classi- fication and dating of Island wares has not been completed;92 as a result noticeable similarities with Attic products might indicate influence in either direction. At two junctures, however, there is in Protoattic something which looks new and of which the Islands have more; in those cases one must be permitted to speak of Island influence. The first such period occurs in Early Protoattic in its "delicate" aspect with its small-scale outline technique and high-rumped horses with twisted outline manes; these features recall the Linear Island group. The priority for a very distinctive way of rendering horses' heads spread out like a hand of cards as on 492, which is found both in Athens and on the Islands (P1. 30), is unclear.93 The other impetus comes into evidence in high and late Middle Protoattic. The most obvious borrowings at that time are the outline protomes, and it is natural to connect these with the 89 See Davison, "Geometric Workshops," p. 53, figs. 65-68. Hampe, Grabfund, p. 46.

The Ram Jug Painter, for instance, paints such outline protomes (544, P1. 33); his floral units too (543) have a Cycladic flavor. The Polyphemos Painter likes Cycladic ornaments such as tongues (P1. 35). The Kynosarges Painter affects a high-legged winged horse of Cycladic breed94 on his name-amphora and "stuffs" the petals of his floral ornament in Cycladic fashion. An analogous Cycladic feature is the outlining of silhouettes to achieve an illusion of depth, as on the Analatan lion 400 (P1. 23) and the dog 563 (P1. 35). The Pair Painter, finally, copies his spirals (P1. 36) from that very "Melian" school which is held in such low esteem by archaeologists.95 After him, Corinth prevails. Plate 30, bottom, illustrates a selection from a votive deposit discarded from some shrine on the north slope of the Areopagus. Besides the goddess plaque (493) there are three main kinds of objects: emblazoned hoplite shields complete on the inside with a central hand-grip for the arm and another at the edge for the fingers,96 terracottas, mostly of horses and groups of horses with white piping and colored paint, and kantharoi (494-497). These last have crude standard Middle Protoattic ornament, though the shape seems to have been devoted to ceremonial use, for the large volume of drinking vessels from wells includes few kantharoi.97 The terracottas are mentioned here only to point out that their white piping and polychrome technique is used on a special kind of contemporary grave pottery found in the Kerameikos98 but hardly at all at the Agora where there were no grand burials at this time; the griffin-head comes from such a pot. The plaque (493) is a very conspectus of newly learned features-applied plastic work, fine figure painting on white ground and three-color polychromy. The reason for the mixture of painting and plastic technique must lie in the nature of the icon. A goddess, especially one flanked by beasts, must make her epiphany9" frontally, but a frontal view is natural only to the coroplast; the painter prefers profiles.'oo The combination of techniques solves the problem of painting such a goddess. Plates 31 and 32 show a variety of little bowls, stands and panels, typical Protoattic small works. From these a group done in a distinct small-work manner can be picked out (510, 512, 529); other examples of the style are known. The pots have many red bands painted directly on the clay ground, zones of scribbled ornament, and occasionally little animals. Of these the kotyle 512, a little comedy of errors, illustrates the prankish, lesser Protoattic mood with an improvised floral ornament, some dogs doing leapfrog and a hare with ears like a panache jumping the hindmost hound. This gay pottery covered with paint of polychrome tones probably sold well and at popular prices; the workshop may have been in the Agora.101 The skyphos (511) which announces that it belongs to ... ylos and which must have been com- missioned by him shows similar spirit; the customary rays at the bottom have been turned into frothing waves through which some fish swim. Later, when open cups are used for drinking, the fish are painted inside, into the wine-dark sea. In the same spirit, only so much the more droll for being so big, are the round-eyed ducks with their spiral doppel-gaengers on the krater 549 (P1. 34). 9 Matz, Gesch. Gr. Kunst., pls. 171, 174. 05 So Cook, op. cit., pp. 113-114, but see now the fine Bellerophon plate from Thasos, B.C.H., LXXXIV, 1960-1961, pp. 347-386. This "Melian" influence seems to have been the last to reach Athens. Kardara, A.J.A., LIX, 1955, p. 53, supposes the influence to have gone from rather than to Athens, and that both schools together influenced later Rhodian pottery. 96 See Lorimer in B.S.A., XLII, 1947, pp. 91-92 on the evidence these Agora shields provide on the newly introduced hoplite organization. 0 The number, variety and size of drinking cups in Greek well deposits make one wonder. 98 See Hampe, Grabfund, pp. 49-50, figs. 30, 31. 99 See in the Catalogue, under 493. 100oo A Cretan Goddess of Birds on an urn is done in the same composite technique, Hesperia, XIV, 1945, pl.

The bold, clean ornament of bowl 506 stands out as Ram Jug work. The acme of Protoattic style falls in the middle of the 7th century. Attic outline painting, which is then at its height, is more than an interlude between the two silhouette techniques of the 8th and 6th century style; it might rather be said that outline painting is to Geometric what red-figure is to black-figure, a change of lighting from behind to full front which puts the figures in the spotlight and gives them body. Consequently Middle Protoattic sometimes comes closer to flesh and blood than the more sophisticated black-figure. The Painter of the Kerameikos Mug Group (439-440, P1. 26; 537, P1. 33) is among the earliest painters in this style. His work has been taken for that of the Ram Jug Painter,103 and he may be that man in his youth. He works in miniature (439, P1. 26) and in detail; his faces are fussy and complicated because he is struggling with true renditions (537, P1. 33); his ornament is inherited from Early Protoattic, but with the tendency toward budding and proliferating which comes to a head with the Kynosarges Painter (567, P1. 35). It is not unthink- able that this finicky worker who devotedly draws little things while his contemporaries are spreading themselves later becomes the surest of them. Two leading Middle Protoattic Painters are known to us, the Ram Jug Painter and the Polyphemos Painter. Fragments by both (Pls. 33 and 35) and nearly complete works by the former (543-544) have been found at the Agora. To choose between them is a matter of merest preference. The Polyphemos Painter has an easy familiarity with the awesome abetted by a very graphic imagination, but the more sedate Ram Jug Painter acquires in his later years the ability to paint faces such as one might not mind seeing in life. They have, in fact, the beginnings of loveliness (543); the painter knows it and sometimes puts a flower fillet on the forehead as a sign. Neither painter has ever heard that pot-painting is a minor art. Especially the Polyphe- mos Painter, who uses the whole pot as a picture area and paints with much white color, would have come into his own in wall-painting ;o104 his pot-painting is sometimes more amazing than appropriate. The Ram Jug Painter is very restrained in his use of white, preferring the natural clay ground to appear in his outline designs. By way of contrast he matches outline designs with correspondingly incised silhouettes, as in the case of the sphinxes' wings of the oinochoe 543, thus showing himself master of both techniques. These standing, lean creatures with their long, thoroughbred faces, light shirt fronts and stiff, pointed wings belong as much to Athens as to the Ram Jug Painter; their Corinthianizing counterpart is a sitting silhouette with sicklewing (557, P1. 84). (He himself has done a more old-fashioned sphinx on the fragment 539, P1. 33.) Selfcontained florals are rarely painted in Protoattic, and so the unit between the sphinxes of 543 is freshly composed from the painter's most tried and true ornaments. The oinochoe is in all respects among his most distinguished works. On a smaller scale he does perfect silhouettes (541); the big sturdy lotus flower appears also with variations on his Chiron Amphora; it is 102 E. g. D6los, XVII, pl. 25. 103 By Cook, B.S.A., XXXV, 1934-1935, p. 189. 104 In fact, however, he was probably unaffected by murals, see M. Robertson, Greek Painting, Geneva, 1959, pp. 44ff.</page><page sequence="34">24 INTRODUCTION taken from the Analatos Painter, who first copies it from the attachments of metal bowls.105 The Ram Jug Painter shows whose heir he is with several other Analatan motifs and usages, such as dotting, "stuffed" rosettes and the guilloche-and-rosette motif.106 Like all Protoattic painters the Ram Jug Painter likes confrontations, but he also paints single figures, one figure, or, better yet, one half-figure to a pot; here is the final defeat of the Geometric frieze. In line with this he perfects the picture panel with the lion protome (544) and incidentally creates a long-lived black-figure type,107 the panel olpe with a great apotropaic eye in the back, of which 544 is the earliest. The protome within the panel is perhaps too little lion and too much line scheme, and it must be a late work; the tiny lions 542 are earlier and livelier. The Analatos Painter shows a similar decline in his old age (e. g. 550, P1. 34); perhaps it takes youth to paint Protoattic. The Ram Jug Painter shows some signs of having learned abroad about such things as Cycladic outline protomes and the use of brown paint,'s08 but one likes to think of him as an Athenian, albeit a traveler. The Polyphemos Painter (P1. 35, top), on the other hand, was an Aeginetan, or at least he worked in Aegina.109 There is a suspicion that his antecedents are not to be sought among the finer exponents of Attic painting but rather in the neigh- borhood of the Mesogeia Painter (a very striking example of borrowing is the pomegranate ornament on the neck of the Eleusis Amphoran0 which has its model in 422, a, P1. 26) by way of the Aeginetan Black and White school."' The Polyphemos Painter's people have the sloping foreheads, long noses and receding chins of Islanders,"i2 and from the Islands he seems to have borrowed his hanging tongue ornament (558, 561) and perhaps others of the wealth of little ornaments with which he embroiders the field. Like his rival, he can work in both the outline and the incision technique (e. g. 560 and 562). The Agora possesses only animals by him. They are large and aggressive; the mule (562) and the horse (559) show their teeth, and the white cock (560) pecks away viciously; of all the Agora fragments this last is closest to the Eleusis Amphora, which seems to belong to a later and freer phase of his work. (Work of his earlier phase, to which the other Agora fragments belong, went under the name of "Horse Painter,"113 before the Eleusis Amphora was found.) Almost all his creatures open their mouths and show their teeth. It is the expression of his delight in the amazing and the fierce. The Kynosarges Painter (P1. 35 bottom) works just after the best period. He stretches and strains the Middle Protoattic tradition so that it is clear that not much of the same kind can come afterwards. This is most evident in his fill ornament, which is all elaboration and ex- crescence. Timid buds sometimes sprout from Ram Jug ornament (553), and there is something of a first spring about them, but the Kynosarges growths look merely over-stimulated. The shapes of the pottery made in his shop are similarly over-strained."4 In the same vein he insists on painting large pots with a tiny brush. 564 comes from the neck of such a pot; the white foot toeing the ground is so similar to that of the wrestlers on the Kynosarges amphora,"5 that 564 may have been its double. In contrast, the earlier Protoargive wrestlers (649, P1. 41) are, 105 Jacobsthal, Greek Pins, illustr. 218ff. This motif is also favored by the Polyphemos Painter, but not as a large-scale panel picture. 106 See for the Analatos painter's motifs, Ktibler, Alt.

Argive painters are in other ways more adept at scenes of struggle since they know how to paint overlapping of limbs."6 The Kynosarges Painter prefers sharp faces (566) with high-bridged beaked noses, almost as if in reaction to the rounded profiles of his predecessors. (His younger contemporary, the Woman Painter, has a similar turn for the dour.) The miniature kantharos (567) has just the right format for the painter's finicky ornament with its little branching scrolls and tongues strung up in a row; the Black and White palmettes on 569 are the prototype on which these elaborate. A sketchy work from his shop (568) illustrates the incipient "stuffing" of all petals which puts an end to Black and White alternation. The Pair Painter's work (P1. 36) has been put together from Agora finds. His technique is on the brink of black-figure, his motifs Cycladic, the discipline of his composition almost Geometric, but his spirit is Protoattic; he might be called the last of the Middle Protoattic painters. He likes friendly pairs of protomes: horses crossing forelegs, facing men,"'7 or single foreparts; there are fourteen to be counted on his three amphorae. The pots cannot stand close inspection; the paint is blotchy on pale ground and the incised lines lack sureness, but his overall composition is a model of clarity. On amphorae of Geometric balance of shape he paints a collar of petals at the shoulder, a ray-calyx at the bottom and a strong spiral belt or protomes over the widest part; the neck has a panel window. Shape and painting are so similar in feeling that one can easily imagine that potter and painter were one. The fill ornament is discreet. The silhouette protomes have a wide-eyed and jolly look. For the men (574) the painter reverts to outline technique. His sense of order is a symptom that Protoattic is now ready to receive the impact of the precise Protocorinthian style. Since "Protoattic" is the name of a style while "black-figure" describes a technique (though one characteristic of 6th century style), either name might be given to much of 7th century painting, literally speaking even from Early Protoattic on. Which term one prefers depends on what one is looking for, whether the end of orientalizing or the beginning of archaic vase painting. Here Late Protoattic is used of the "Earliest Black-figure" pottery which falls in style between the Kynosarges and the Nessos Painter (P1. 37). The latter is excluded because he is "in possession of a settled technique and a settled style,"'11s that is, he is past Protoattic. The Woman Painter is the first of Beazley's black-figure painters.119 A fragment with a swan from the Agora (581) is by him; the rosette, the polychrome technique using both the ordinary purplish red and a second cherry red, and the neatly determined incision are taken from Late Protocorinthian pottery. He is among the first to Corinthianize carefully and consciously with that turn to the grand that marks earliest black-figure. The squarish jagged profile of the thallophoros (579) is close to those of his women."12 Some polychrome lotus fragments (583) also show ornament of this period. One wonders whether the Attic painters would have accepted the return of the silhouette if it had not been for the gay new palette that came with it. The Cycladic protomes in neck panels are received into Protoattic painting at the time of the Protomel21 and the Pair Painter (P1. 36). Two valued goods appear in the picture windows; horses and women. Whereas in Middle Protoattic outline and silhouette were mixed on the same pot and in the same figure, their use is now specialized-the horses are black-figured, the women in outline technique; in this way the beast's hide is distinguished from the lady's white skin. The facing protomes of 588 show how much more boldly painters have learned to use 116 See Robertson, Greek Painting, pp. 43ff. 117 They are rubbing noses or kissing. This may be the earliest erotic scene in Attic painting. 118 Beazley, Dev., p. 12. 119 J. D.

One characteristic of early incision (554, 557, P1. 34) remains, namely the redundant outlining of the silhouettes which is the counterpart of brush outlining.122 The women (589) have the high busts and long bobs of their Cycladic prototypes. The picture panel on the shoulder of an amphora comes into its own after the neck panel. Earlier Subgeometric belly amphorae had simple ornaments in their shoulder panels (21, P1. 2; 514, P1. 32), while large scale metope decoration goes back to Late Geometric oinochoai (340, P1. 20); but the coalescence of these into one of the principal black-figure genres, viz. the picture window on the shoulder of a large black belly-amphora, begins with 578 (P1. 37). As for the protomes, they come into Protoattic painting at first merely as little diversions,123 but these new large women protomes carry an implication which arises from the protome form itself, i. e., the urbane notion that the head matters most. The face of 578 has been compared to early Attic marble sculpture; the painter indeed seems to refer to another, frontal view if the little line at the corner of the mouth may be taken as the crease of an archaic smile.'24 But the stronger connection is with the best time of Middle Protoattic outline painting; the broad sure brush and the florid profile with its fleshy nose and almond eye recall the Ram Jug Painter, who might have been this man's master. The facial lines of the woman amphora next in time are peaked in comparison. The last figured piece in this volume is the ugly but complete siren neck (590, P1. 38). Its actual date is probably not much earlier than Early Black-figure, but its animal types and its technique are so uncertain that it may be safely called Late Protoattic. The rim moulding (P1. 42) is undeveloped, the paint blotchy and weak, and the incision unpractised. The way the sphinx's wings are buckled on is paralleled on Middle Protoattic birds; the inner markings of the horse, which is rammed squarely into its panel prison, are imperfectly learned from Proto- corinthian; the ornament is Late Protoattic, that is, a mixture of new Protocorinthian motifs such as bud rosettes with familiar Protoattic fillers like spiral hooks and swastikas. Compared with a product of the perfected outline style (578) the work seems gauche; but in other hands this is the style of the future. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES, INNOVATIONS AND IMPORTS Several minor decorative techniques, all very old, are represented among the Agora finds. There is a Light on Dark technique (Pl. 39) which is used as an alternate to the dreary Subgeometric scheme of reserved bands (591). Anything more ambitious than yellowish white linear decoration is rare, though squirming octopuses occur on the neck of early one-piece amphorae (592-593). Two large all-glazed pots (95, P1. 5; 100, P1. 6) of the third quarter of the 7th century, decorated with white linear patterns and of distinctively Protoattic shape, were clearly made by the same potter; these might be thought of as semi-black ware, i. e., the first beginnings of classical black ware. The Light on Dark technique is commonly thought of as Cretan,126 but if it was not a revival from the Mycenaean, it came to Athens through Corinth, for the earliest signs of it appear on oinochoai made in imitation of Corinthian Light on Dark oinochoai.127 122 It is normal in Protocorinthian black-figure. 123 See Jahrb., II, 1887, p. 46, fig. 7. Cauldron attachments must have suggested half-figures to the painters in the first place. 124 This line is however a convention on Cycladic protomes. A more precise comparison with the early kouroi seems futile, if only because they are themselves not easily serialized; see E. B. Harrison, Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pp. 802-304. 125 See Diepolder in Festschrift fur Carl Weickert, Berlin, 1955, p. 119, figs. 5-8. 126 See Hesperia, XIV, 1945, p. 6. 127 Brann N 8, N 9. Light on Dark technique is plentiful on Attic Mycenaean.</page><page sequence="37">SPECIAL TECHNIQUES AND IMPORTS 27 Incision is the most primitive sort of decoration;128 in fact, when used on unpainted clay ground, it must be very easy to do. It is used in Athens on the coarse household ware (198-199, P1. 11; P1. 40). The simple patterns are always the same, wavy zigzag and dash lines which are usually made with a forked straw so as to give the breadth of a painted line. These patterns are always put on the same parts of the pot, namely on rim, shoulder and handle. If there is a nipple, a swastika is sometimes centered on it. As the cooking ware shapes grow more refined this decoration is omitted; this happens in the 7th century, and marks the civilizing of "Bauern- keramik" in Greek times. It is perhaps not mere coincidence that black-figure incision technique begins when coarse ware incision ceases, though one would hardly claim that putting zigzags on cooking pots is training for engraving sphinxes' wings. Finally, there are the various stamped and impressed techniques used to decorate pithoi (P1. 40). Fine, full-scale, decorated pithoi were probably not made in Athens much before the 6th century B.C. The two scraps 605-606 must be imports. The Attic pithos decoration is rather simple-minded; it is often no more than an imitation of the ropes which were and still are often tied around the neck of pithoi to help in handling them. It is sometimes made by pressing a real rope into the clay (608) but more often by applying rolls of clay. In addition circular punches and incision are used. There is evidence that in the Protoattic period, as in the Protogeometric period, there was a special interest in improving paints. The evidence for both periods is alike, namely trial pieces (633-635, P1. 40).129 Such trial pieces were, of course, used at every firing in any period, but it is perhaps not wholly accidental that the large lots from the Agora are of these key periods; a certain standard was evidently desired-we know the results in the firm black or brown paints of later Protogeometric and earlier Geometric pottery and in the sheen of Classical black ware. The trial pieces themselves are scraps of pottery, usually bottoms of cups, with holes cut into them before firing and covered with spashes of paint. They were put into the kiln and withdrawn with hooks at intervals to test the progress of firing.130 These trial pieces must come from the dump of a potter's workshop; some unfinished rejects (628-632, P1. 40) come from the same deposit. There is a suspicion that this very shop was the first to indulge in the use of applied red paint, which is the main survival of Protoattic polychromy into black-figure; a number of small works with a lavish application of red (510, 512, 529, Pls. 31-32) and a lump of yellow ochre (MC 1056, Well R 17:5) of the sort used in making colored paints were found in deposits associated with the shop. The date of the establishment is the second quarter of the 7th century, just the time when red paint begins to be used regularly. There are traces of a renewed interest in the amenities of ordinary life in the 7th century (Pls. 39-40). Among the new conveniences are babies' commodes (600-603), well heads (604), cooking stands, cooking plates, braziers (623-627) and lamps,.13A Even if these seem mean tokens by which to gauge a renaissance, it is at least a fact that no one seems to have thought of them in the Dark Ages. The pottery imports too bear witness to a more diverse new life. Roughly speaking, in the 8th century the Athenians exported pottery,'a2 in the 7th they imported it. Consequently they were conservative teachers in the former, innovating learners in the latter period. Pottery of the following fabrics has been found in Agora deposits beginning in the last quarter of the 8th century (Pls. 13 and 41): Corinthian (155-158, P1. 9; 238, 240-243, 636-648), Argive (231-235, 649-651), Chian (225-227, 230, 244, 653-656), Rhodian (657), East Greek (228-229), 128 See Kerameikos, V, 1, p. 139. 129 The Protogeometric trial pieces come from Well L 11:1. On trial pieces see A. Winter, "Die Technik des griechischen Topfers in ihren Grundlagen," Technische Beitrage zur Archdologie, Mainz, 1959, p. 33. 130o For a short account of Greek pottery making, see Cook, Greek Painted Pottery, pp. 242-252. 131 Brann F 57-58. 132 See Kerameikos, V, 1, pp. 283ff.</page><page sequence="38">28 INTRODUCTION Etruscan (659), Egyptian (236-237, doubtful). There is more Corinthian pottery than all the other imported fabrics combined. A first herald of this flood of imports is the coarse ware storage jar (242,P1.13) of the second quarter of the 8th century; from the last quarter on almost every well group contains fairly large amounts of Protocorinthian and Early Corinthian pottery, usually about one-tenth of the whole lot. The proportion falls off sharply in the 6th century.133 The imported pottery comes largely in open shapes such as kotylai (P1. 9) which are unsuitable as containers and cannot have been bought for the sake of their contents; the heavy mortars and kraters (240, 243) must also have been brought in as pottery products. The aryballoi, both those of fine Corinthian ware (238) and those of so-called Argive monochrome fabric (231, 233), may have contained Corinthian unguents. The rest of the imports-Chian chalices, Rhodian bird bowls, Etruscan kantharoi, Chian wine jars-are no more proof of direct trade with the places where they were made than the Attic Geometric exports prove organized Attic trade in the 8th century.ll Probably Corinth, Athens' main source of imports, and Aegina, Athens' only major 7th century market,'35 served as convenient emporia for these Eastern rarities. If there had been, for instance, direct trade routes to the east, why was no Cycladic or Cretan pottery to speak of ever picked up on the way? The absence of this neighboring pottery (only 658 and perhaps the stamped pithos fragments 605, 606 from the Agora) is the more surprising in view of the strong Cycladic influence on Protoattic; the explanation must be that the potters and not the pottery traveled.136 The evidence that Athens became temporarily parochial in the 7th century'37 also implies that she carried on no direct trade. Her oil, the only extensive export item of the period, which was sent abroad in jars which are the forerunners of the Panathenaic amphorae (P1. 2),138s must then have been carried by Corinthian merchantmen. A final ar- gument against much commercial enterprise in 7th century Athens arises from the very nature of the Attic pottery. It was made by a few painters with very personal styles in fairly small amounts. Its development is comfortably capricious and shows no signs of the routine which follows commercial intentions139-it is unjaded. 133 See J. L. Benson, Die Geschichte der korinthischen Vasen, Basel, 1953, pp. 100ff. for the shift of the pottery export market from Corinth to Athens. 134 Dunbabin, Greeks and Eastern Neighbours, pp. 21-22 observes that Geometric exports were probably not trade-ware but the personal belongings of private travellers. See also C. Roebuck, lonian Trade and Colonization, New York, 1959, pp. 79-80. 3s5 This leaves out of account the towns within the Attic synoecism such as Eleusis. For Attic and other imports in Aegina see Kraiker, Aigina, passim. x136 Schweitzer, RBm. Mitt., LXII, 1955, p. 105, has found evidence of a travelling Attic painter, the painter of the Aristo- nothos krater.

APPEARANCE OF FABRICS ATTIC FINE WARE (wheelmade): Most of the pottery here published is made of Attic clay. This clay is conventionally described as pinkish buff in color; actually it varies from a pale whitish buff to a deep orange and red. It contains a few specks of silvery mica, but not much. The fabric of the Dipylon period is commonly firm and sturdy-walled. From Late Geometric through the mid 7th century there is a noticeable softening so that the pottery is often chalky with no firm surface. In the third quarter of the 7th century much thin- walled, hard pottery, which is noticeably deeper in color, is made, clearly with the intention of imitating the feel of metal. At the end of the century much of the pottery approximates the firm orange color seen on Attic black-figure vases. ATTIC COOKING WARE (handmade): Another variety of Attic fabric is little levigated, highly micaceous and leather brown to red in color. It is used primarily for cooking ware and often shows signs of burning, but many other kitchen and courtyard shapes are also made of it, particularly water dippers. Its special qualities are its lightness, a much-reduced porosity and resistance to heat. It is not easily distinguishable from the cooking fabrics of other sites. This pottery is shaped by hand without the aid of the wheel. ATTIC PITHOS FABRIC: Pithoi and very large basins are made of a fabric which is in the main like that of the cooking ware except that it is much thicker and heavier and has a gray core. Sometimes it originally contained a binder of straw; almost always there are very large impurities. It is often brick red to scarlet in color. This pottery also is built by hand.</page><page sequence="40">30 CATALOGUE: AMPHORAE, DECORATED CORINTHIAN FINE WARE: The Protocorinthian wheelmade pottery is made of very fine, firm, yellowish buff clay which is almost without mica. During the 7th century the fabric becomes softer and paler. CORINTHIAN COARSE WARE: Corinthian coarse ware is distinguishable from Attic pithos fabric and is used for a much greater variety of shapes. It is pale buff to tan in color, with large, dark sometimes reddish grits. Often it has a gray core and a fine light slip. Some Attic tubs copy this fabric, but they contain the remains of a great deal of straw binder. ARGIVE MONOCHROME: This fabric is extremely fine and well levigated, buff colored, and sometimes polished or pared. Some of it is more gritty and colorless; this was probably produced in Attica. EAST GREEK, PARTICULARLY CHIAN: East Greek fabric is most easily recognizable from the decoration and the glaze which is often grayish blue and weak. Chian coarse ware, however, has a scarlet tinge with a gray core, and much golden mica; there is usually a surfacing of white clay. POTTERY BY SHAPE AMPHORAE: DECORATED (Pls. 1-2). Though there are many amphorae of the later 8th and 7th centuries from the Agora, they do not fall into a consistent series. An inspection of the rim profiles (P1. 42) shows that all the types of the 6th century are already incipient but that there is no uniformity of scale. The following facts, however, do emerge: The Late Geometric rim is usually merely thickened and rounded outside (Brann I 1, 289); a real torus is achieved only by the Dipylon amphorae (246); the later of these are weaker (289). In Latest Geometric and Early Protoattic some sort of profiling is the rule, though it consists of nothing more than putting a slant on the thickened rim (4, 344, 384) or of undercutting (454). In Middle Protoattic this same profiling is made crisper (19) and experimentally elaborated (557). In Late Protoattic this develops into a pseudo-collar (586) and finally into a real collar (578) of the kind standard in 6th century amphorae (P 23476). But the scheme is by no means set; some Late Protoattic rims have a simple flare with thickening (18). As for the shape of the body, the general trend is as follows: the belly-handled amphorae end with the Dipylon series (1). The small neck amphorae of the second and third quarters of the 8th century are sometimes curiously slender and elongated (6, 7), but the large ones (2) have that perfect egg-shape with the well-proportioned cylindrical neck which defines Geometric balance. Late in the second quarter (8, 3) and in the last quarter of the century (9ff.) all sorts of variations and proportions obtain, as is to be ex- pected in a period of innovation. The hyper-slender amphora (12) survives since it is congenial to the tendency toward the finely drawn of the Early Proto- attic painters, even where the painter himself works crudely (13). There are few amphorae of the first half of the 7th century in the Agora; the scraps (454, Pls. 28, 42) show a counter tendency to huge format which is also consonant with a counter school in painting (e. g. J.H.S., XXXII, 1912, pl. XI, the New York Nessos amphora). These amphorae pre- serve the Geometric egg-and-cylinder scheme, but have narrower bases and a higher center of gravity. In the middle quarters of the 7th century this shape has developed into the characteristic Protoattic form: a beet-like body and a neck with a corresponding concavity (20). At the same time the Geometric un- botanical shape survives (19). The 7th century is the time of innovations, which are, however, not all immediately exploited, e. g. the all-glazed black ware amphora (16), and most im- portant, the one-piece belly amphora, which is first made with Subgeometric decor (21, 22) but which later on becomes the chief black-figure amphora (e. g. Hesperia, VII, 1938, p. 367, figs. 1ff., by the Nessos Painter). 1 (-= 245) Amphora fragments, Dipylon. Pls. 1 (Restoration), 14. P 10664. Well, B 14:5.

STORAGE JARS (Pls. 2, 42). This amphora type with a glazed body, an 2O0 marking on the neck, and an echinus-shaped rim has been found throughout the Mediterranean, but is shown to be Attic by the frequency with which it appears in groups found in Attica, by the occurrence of Attic miniatures and by the representation of such an amphora on the Attic Frangois Vase. In it Attic oil, and probably wine as well, was stored and also exported. The series begins in the later 8th century B.C. (23, 25), when the body is long, the foot and the neck are cylindrical, and the rim is set off by a well- marked ridge. After that the trend is toward a more bulb-shaped body (24) with a high shoulder, a more flaring foot, and a thinner and more flaring rim with a less clearly marked ridge (28). Except for a few later stragglers (P 14691) this series ceases at the end</page><page sequence="43">CATALOGUE: STORAGE JARS 38 of the 7th century, after which there appears an amphora type without neck markings and with a torus rim (Young II 1).

J.H.S., LXXI, 1951, pl. 39, a. Latest 7th century B.C. BANDED WARE (PIs. 3 and 5). After a long life among the fine ware shapes the banded amphorae become utility ware and by the second half of the 8th century B.C. they are no longer used for burial but exclusively in wells as water pots or in storage and hauling (see the miniature cart with six such amphorae from Euboea, B.S.A., LII, 1957, pl. 3). Besides the normal neck amphorae (15, 29, 34), variants, evidently all contemporary, occur: a rim- handled neckless pot (30, 31), a neckless pot with the handles attached below the rim (32). In the 7th cen- tury banded jugs are substituted for banded am- phorae for use at the well, and the latter are rarer. Two examples of the second half of the 7th century (35, 34) show that both the neck amphora and the pot without offset neck are at that time still made, though they cease in the 6th century. These later pots follow the general trend in having fuller bodies and more flaring feet. Some time early in the 7th century a banded round-mouthed jug comes into favor in place of the banded amphorae. A late Geometric close-banded jug (87) seems to be the more dignified forerunner. In the 7th century the decoration of the jugs appears fairly uniform, with widely spaced banding and a wavy line on the shoulder (88). The shape is also much the same throughout the century except that the later examples are a little more squat (90). Late in the 7th century these jugs are replaced by a jug with cylindrical neck based on a metal model (Brann H 50). Main references: amphorae, Brann L 6; jugs, Brann F 43. 29 Banded amphora. P1. 3.

BANDED AND CEREMONIAL HYDRIAI (PI. 3). It is not clear whether the banded hydriai are survivals or revivals of their Protogeometric proto- type. Two from the Kerameikos (Kerameikos, V, 1, pl. 50) are of the first half of the 8th century, two from the Agora (Brann I 4 and 37) are of the middle or third quarter; 39 is probably late 8th century.</page><page sequence="45">CATALOGUE: LARGE OINOCHOAI 35 On 37 details of Protogeometric decoration are in- tentionally copied, as if to indicate that these are old-fashioned pots. Banded hydriai apparently dis- appear in the 7th century, probably being supplanted by the newly invented cooking ware hydriai like 218. In the Islands such ware continues to be made and imported into Athens (see under 226). Very different looking are the ceremonial hydriai which are one of the main shapes of Late Geometric (Young XI 7) and Early Protoattic (384, 416, 417). Whereas the banded kind is clearly of the size to be a water pot (39, Brann I 4, N 6 come from wells; the others were used as burial pots), these figured hydriai are far too small and frail to have been used for hauling water. They are almost always decorated with plastic snakes around the rim, and follow in shape the elongated amphorae of the Late Geometric (12) and Early Protoattic (13) period. 37 Banded hydria. P1. 3.

Late Geometric neck oinochoai show a great deal of variety in the shape of the body; roughly three kinds can be distinguished: first, oinochoai of what might be called the standard shape (since it has the longest continuous history) with deep egg-shaped body (45). These are rarer in the Late Geometric period than before but reappear in the 7th century; see below. Secondly, a rather squat shape, probably under the influence of Middle Geometric squat oinochoai like Hesperia, V, 1936, p. 32, fig. 31. These appear in all gradations of squatness at the same time; they are the most numerous Late Geometric shape (46-50). Thirdly, well-dippers, also with deep body but a wider neck than the foregoing (80, 87); these are modelled on Corinthian Geometric banded oinochoai. Late in the 8th and in the first part of the 7th century a deep oinochoe type of small format with conical neck is popular; the type is called "Phaleron" since many were found there (52). From this time on, the olpe is much preferred and very few large oinochoai are made; an example of the mid 7th century (53) has a narrower base and a more conical neck than the Geometric deep oinochoai. Another, of the third quarter, is ill-articulated and careless (54). From then on neck oinochoai are made only in small sizes (e. g. 71); the shape dies out in the late 7th cen- tury B.C. 45 Oinochoe, Late Geometric. P1. 4. P 4772. Grave, G 12:8. Young XX 7.

Third quarter of the 7th century B.C. SUBGEOMETRIC OINOCHOAI (P1. 4). Like all Subgeometric pottery series the small neckless oinochoe, really a small-sized olpe, begins within the Late Geometric period (57) and acquires the usual Subgeometric scheme late in the 8th century B.C. (58). It lasts through the 7th century but with no very clear trend in the shape (note, for in- stance, the great difference between 59 and 60, from the same deposit) except that it tends to become slimmer, and a single reserved band is used instead of a banded zone. Some time around the middle of the century, probably under East Greek influence, a round- mouthed jug, also with a Subgeometric scheme, is introduced (63). This passes into the black ware repertoire (69) to become very popular in the 6th century B.C. 57 Small neckless oinochoe, Late Geometric. P1. 4. P 4970. Grave, G 12:14. Young IX, 17.

Round-bodied, round-mouthed, flat-bottomed aryballoi appear from the late 8th (65) through the late 7th (68) century and show no regular develop- ment. They are interesting because they are a Sub- geometric either adaptation of a Cretan type or holdover of the earliest Protocorinthian round ary- ballos which disappeared in favor of the ovoid shape in the late 8th century B.C. (Payne, NC, pp. 5-7, pl. 1, 1-3); either is possible. 65 Aryballos, Subgeometric. P1. 4. P 25791. Grave, Q 17:6. Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 416, no. 4, pl. 92. H. 0.09 m. Cf.

Payne (NC, p. 6) points out that the round aryballos here copied is originally a Cretan shape (e. g. Hesperia, XIV, 1945, pls. XVII-XIX), that it is remarkably static in Crete, and that it changes only after its introduction to Corinth in the later 8th century B.C. The Attic Subgeometric copies are also without development and may therefore be more directly dependent on Crete than on Corinth, especially since Cretan contemporary examples exist, e. g. Brock, Fortetsa, pl. 98, De'los, XV, pl. LII, A 12, perhaps rather Attic (?). The shape behaves in the same way. however, also at Ithaca, B.S.A., XLVIII, 1953, pl. 59, no. 1047.

H. 0.167 m.; diam. 0.16 m. Over a hundred years separate this wide-necked trefoil jug from its Geometric counterpart 80 (401 is a link between them). It is another hundred years before this shape, sometimes called chous, becomes a standard part of the black ware repertoire, though it does occur somewhat earlier as a black-figure shape (e. g. Karouzou, The Amasis Painter, p. 33, no. 89, shape III). This later type has a narrower neck than 81. Late 7th century B.C. OLPAI (Pls. 5, 7). The olpe, the least articulated of all shapes made for pouring, was invented at Athens in the late 8th century B.C., apparently by the workshop of the amphora Athens 897 and was used at first primarily as a well-dipper (82, 83, 84). During the 7th century olpai are still found in wells but bear some of the most advanced and inter- esting decoration of an Protoattic shape (85,492,544). The Protoattic examples differ in having a somewhat wider trefoil rim and in having acquired a disk foot. Late in the century the foot has a sharp flare and the shape is altogether more sinuous and slim. Olpai are a major fine ware shape in black-figure with a stand- ard decor of a panel in front and an eye in back; the earliest of these is our 544, of the third quarter of the 7th century B.C. A small round-mouthed olpe which gains great currency in the 6th century is first represented by 629, of the third quarter of the 7th century.

Last quarter of the 7th century B.C. STANDED KRATERS (P1. 5). The series of kraters is very incomplete in the Agora. Of the great Dipylon kraters only disiecta membra appear (P1. 16). There is one complete Late Geometric krater (92) of small size, and the remains of the ribbed foot of a rather larger one (93); these merely show the decline of this monumental form. In the 7th century fenestration is substituted for rib- bing (95); however, a fragment of an unusually heavy standed bowl of unknown shape shows just a plain cylinder (96). The most distinctive shape of the 7th century, the egg-shaped krater (95, 549), though it</page><page sequence="52">42 CATALOGUE: BOWLS AND KRATERS WITHOUT STANDS looks as characteristically Protoattic as 92 looks Geometric, is nevertheless directly evolved out of the latter type by deepening the body in favor of the stand; it is possible that the Cretan pithos (Brock, Fortelsa, pls. 79ff.) suggested this development. This egg-shaped krater is a precursor in shape of the classical lebes gamikos (Richter and Milne, Shapes and Names, p. 11, fig. 72), but the krater itself dis- appears in the last quarter of the 7th century B.C. BOWLS AND KRATERS WITHOUT STANDS (P1. 6). A number of cauldron-shaped bowls, mostly showing Corinthian influence, were found (97, 103, 104). Of these 103 shows particularly the in- fluence of Corinthian metal working. 104 is inter- esting as a first example, not indeed of the true column krater which occurs some 75 years earlier (487), but of a subsidiary form without handles, evidently at home in Corinth and recurring for hun- dreds of years in Athens.

It is possible that the stand is not Attic, for besides the white surfacing it shows specks of golden mica. In that case it must be East Greek and must come from a big krater of the type represented by the krateriskoi, Ath. Mitt., LXXII, 1957, p. 45, Beil. 65, from Samos.

The conversion of birds into squiggles takes place also on Proto- corinthian kotylai from which the decoration is borrowed. Shape like Young C 96. Late 8th century B.C. SPOUTED BOWLS (P1. 6). This shape is a revival of a Mycenaean type (B.S.A., XLII, 1947, p. 39, fig. 16 B). Those of the third quarter of the 8th century are rather low and broad (Hampe, Sagenbilder, pl. 22, 33). Thereafter the trend is reversed. The earliest whole example is 98, a very deep bowl of the last quarter of the 8th century. After that date the shape develops straightforwardly: it becomes lower and broader with a higher shoulder; the handles rise up over the rim; the foot increases in flare. The latest examples (101, 103) are accordingly the lowest ones, echinus-shaped with long-arched handles. The drawn-in rim and the spouts of these bowls are more appropriate to wine mixing and pouring than to washing. Standed bowls with spouts like those found at Menidi may sometimes have served as containers of wash water, i. e. louteria (H. Kenner, "Das Luterion im Kult," Jahresh., XXIX, 1935, pp. 125ff.) but there is no evidence at all that the ordinary spouted bowl was a louterion; on the con- trary, Amyx (Hesperia, XXVII, 1958, pp. 222-228) has shown that the shape of that name was a broad, open-standed bowl. Our bowls were probably usually used as kraters, though function and shape are fluid enough in the 7th century to allow for their occasional use as more elegant wash basins.

BowLs WITH RETURN HANDLES (Pls. 6, 7). The large Geometric plate with return handles attached at the rim (105) gives rise to a bowl shape with flaring sides and flat rim, with either two handles (110) or one (112). The examples of the second half of the 7th century often have Corinthianizing poly- chrome decoration and the contours are crisper, almost metallic looking (111); in particular a mould- ing which the better Late Geometric plates have at the handle zone (114) now reappears. The shape, therefore, originates in Attica, but becomes stand- ardized as the "lidless lekanis" under Early Corin- thian influence in the later 7th century B.C.

Late 7th century B.C. PLATES (P1. 7).

The series 117, 118 (last quarter of the 8th cen- tury B.C.), 119 (mid 7th century B.C.), P 12687 (late 7th century B.C.) shows the corresponding decline in the decoration from the full scale Late Geometric to the meager banding with a wavy line at the rim characteristic of the semi-black ware plates of the late 7th century. 113 Plate, Late Geometric.

Aside from various large bowls like 224 and 100 which may have been used for washing, two types of standard utility banded bowl exist. The first goes back to the late 8th century B.C. (Brann 0 11). It has a characteristically rounded rim, in the earlier ones simply convex on the outside (121, 120, first half of the 7th century B.C.); later on the rim is bent out, rounded on top and convex beneath (122, second quarter of the 7th century B.C.). The handles are rolled and horizontal (P 13336 con- tinues the type in the 6th century). The second kind does not appear until the third quarter of the 7th century B.C. (123). It is a low broad bowl with a wide flat overhanging rim and heavy rolled handles set vertically on the rim in a flat arc. 124 is of the same deposit as 123 and cannot be much later, but it shows the only consistent trend of change observable in these bowls: the foot flares much more. Of the 6th century: P 13119. This bowl type appears to be derived from a popular metal type and occurs both earlier and later in many fabrics, Mycenaean, Corinthian, Chian, Etruscan; see under Brann H 18. For Mycenaean metal bowls of this kind see Karo, Schachtgrdber von Mykenai, Munich, 1930, pl. CLIX. 120 Fragment of basin, Protoattic. Pl. 7. P 14211. Well, S 19:7.

In the middle of the 8th century the Geometric skyphos still has a well-marked disk foot, a rounded</page><page sequence="57">CATALOGUE: SKYPHOI 47 body and a straight, offset rim (125). The tendency in the third quarter (126, 127, also those from Young, Grave XVII, pl. 2) is toward a looser and sometimes deeper shape; the foot begins to wither away. The maeander disappears as the standard shoulder deco- ration; besides the popular panel decoration a broad reserved zone with little or no ornament is often used. For the last quarter of the 8th century (129, 130, 131) our evidence is particularly plentiful because of the closing at this time of so many wells, all of which were filled with rubbish containing many skyphoi (see Brann, I-R, pl. 7). At this time skyphoi no longer have feet, and the rim is hardly set off from the body. Furthermore, the contours and especially the deco- ration show great variety, including all the earlier schemes in a degenerate form, with bird metopes (130), false fluting (Brann O 19) and solid glaze (129) among the most popular. For the first half of the 7th century we have evidence only of Subgeometric skyphoi (q. v.). The fish skyphos (132) of the middle of the century proves that the full-sized Late Geometric type has survived. It has now re-acquired a full body, an offset rim and a ring foot. The shape can be traced in the third quarter with Subgeometric decor (133); the foot is narrower and the rim more flaring. In the last quarter of the century (134) the shape is well on the way to the black ware cups of komast shape (P 17837), thus showing that this foremost 6th century Attic cup has an Attic ancestry.

Corinth, Hesperia, XVII, 1948, pl. 80, D 34-35; Samos, Ath. Mitt., LXXII, 1957, Beil. 72. The Attic one seems however to have enough of an ancestry at home to be called in- digenous. Last quarter of the 7th century B.C. SUBGEOMETRIC SKYPHOI (P1. 8). The Subgeometric skyphoi develop straight- forwardly. They have their origin in a deep variant (135) of the ordinary late Geometric skyphos of the third quarter of the 8th century B.C. Later in the century they are usually painted all over (136, 137) with a well offset, flaring rim. Afterwards the tendency is toward a deeper body with a wider, more flaring rim but one less clearly offset. Some time in the late 8th or early 7th century the Subgeometric characteristic of a reserved handle zone is introduced (138, 139); this scheme is retained into the 6th century. Again sometime about the middle of the 7th century a reverse in the shape-trend takes place: the body becomes broader and the rim and handles shrink (140-142). The latest 7th century examples show a shiny black glaze and simplified contours, handles with next to no loop and hardly any rim. The shape continues in the 6th century (P 3621).

This bell-shaped Phaleron type is reminiscent enough of a Mycenaean shape (B.S.A., XLII, 1947, pp. 34-35, fig. 14 A) to have a metal prototype similar to those suggested for the Mycenaean type (ibid., p. 63), though we have no actual examples.

This cup is interesting on two counts, first because it is a survival from a Protogeometric shape (Des- borough, Protogeometric Pottery, pp. 102ff., pl. 12). More such cups were found in a Middle Geometric context (P 3681-P 3682), so it is safe to think of this cup as a direct survival. Secondly, it is likely that the shape survived because metal cups of this general shape were current; Polyphemos on the neck of the Eleusis amphora (Mylonas, Eleusis Amphora, pl. 7) is holding one clearly marked as metal by the return handles. It is hard to say whether these handles are intended to be vertical or horizontal; however bronze cups of both types exist. See Payne, Perachora, pl. 58, 1 and 2. The predecessor shape in Mycenaean times also exists in metal; see the gold cups, Arch. Anz., LV, 1940, p. 218, fig. 52, also B.S.A., XXXIX, 1938-1939, pl. 26, where a gold cup and its clay counterpart are shown. The connecting features are the conical foot and the offset rim. 7th century B.C. KOTYLAI, CORINTHIAN AND CORINTHIANIZING (P1. 9). The kotyle is the most characteristic of Proto- corinthian shapes and it may be taken for granted that when it occurs in the Attic fabric it is copied. Fortunately a nearly complete series of Corinthian imports of the type which served as models has been found at the Agora to illustrate this fact; only for the two earlier stages (153-154) are the Corinthian proto- 4</page><page sequence="60">50 CATALOGUE: KOTYLAI, CORINTHIAN AND CORINTHIANIZING types absent. The development of the kotyle is fairly consistent, and since both the Corinthian originals and their imitations are found in deposits of the same date, it is certain that the lag between the original and the copy is minimal. The broad shapes with rounded walls (153,154) are the earliest. They just precede in shape a kotyle from the oldest known grave at Cumae (Mon. Ant., XIII, 1903, p.274, fig. 58) which has become pivotal in dating of 8th and 7th century pottery since it has been given the absolute date of 725 B.c. by a very reasonable combination of literary and archaeological evidence (Byvanck, Mnemosyne, IV, 1936-1937, p. 223). Next in the series come our Corinthian 155 and Attic 159 which are deep and have fairly straight sides and are glazed at the bottom with bands above; these are of the late 8th century B.C. Long rays are substituted for the glaze in the first half of the 7th century B.C. (Corinthian 156; Attic, 160). Toward the middle and in the third quarter of the 7th century solid glaze is in turn substituted for the bands (Corinthian, 157; Attic, 161); the shape-trend continues to be toward a deeper body with a narrow base and straight flaring sides. At some time in the third quarter this trend is reversed; the Early Corinthian kotylai grow lower and broader with rounded sides and the rays become correspondingly shorter (Corinthian, 158; Attic, 162). For most of these stages there is a regular and also a double sized type (163-168). Besides the canonical series of copies the Attic potter invents variations to suit his more mobile temperament, such as 165. On the whole, the exact copies are not as nicely done as genuine Protoattic ware, showing that, for the most part, copying was perfunctory work for the Attic craftsmen, although especially in the later examples a salutary Corinthian influence on his technique, especially in the appear- ance of true black glaze, is visible. In the 6th century kotylai become a fully Attic possession (P 5866). Bibliography in Kerameikos, V, 1, p. 72 and note 104. 153 Kotyle, Attic copy of Earliest Protocorinthian. P1. 9. P 15029.

Since 153 is lower and broader than these, it may be a little earlier, which would make it the earliest in Athens; this is, however, by no means sure.

Last quarter of the 7th century B.C. KANTHAROI (Pls. 10, 30). The kantharos with high-swung handle comes into the Geometric repertoire in the second quarter of the 8th century B.C. (169). Finds of Minyan goblets made in Athens at the time (Young B 22-24) may be possible sources of this type; it is also reminiscent of Mycenaean goblet types with high-swung handles (e. g. Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 74, 14 or H. Bossert, The Art of Ancient Crete, London, 1937, fig. 150). A Mycenaean source seems more likely and the reasons for this are explained under 169, the earliest kantharos from the Agora, where the late dating of the other early kantharoi such as Keramneikos, V, 1, pl. 85, inv. 258 is discussed. All the earlier kantharoi have a short upright rim not strongly marked off from the body. They are rather wide and full-shouldered compared to the later ones. In the third and beginning of the last quarter some kantharoi have higher rims than the early examples (170), which are, however, not much set off from the shoulder except by means of decoration; others have no rims at all, but have a drawn-in effect (174, 173) much like a tulip flower. The shape tends toward a deeper, less articulated bowl with the handle loop less upright and more flaring away from the body. The very Latest Geo- metric kantharoi (175) conserve much of the shape and decoration of the earliest ones in spite of the changes noted. This gives the impression that the kantharos is at once a static and an irregular shape, i. e. an erratic by-line. 4*</page><page sequence="62">52 CATALOGUE: ONE-HANDLED CUPS This impression is confirmed by the Protoattic 7th century kantharoi. They do not occur much in household deposits, but seem to have been used mostly as votives (494-497). They are all deeper than the Geometric examples, but aside from that, they have all conceivable shapes: convex, concave, tulip- shaped and high-rimmed. Little, unpainted votives are numerous (176).

Cf. also CVA Mann- heim 1, pl. 5, 1. At the same period (i. e. the third quarter of the 8th century) a variant with an even higher rim exists (OVA Munich 3, pl. 120, 1), which is interesting because it is far closer to a kantharos shape belonging to Lausitz pottery which MilojSi6 suggests influenced the Attic pottery of this date (Arch. Anz., LXIII-LXIV, 1948-49, pl. 31, fig. 4, 1); at the same time it must be pointed out that this form is strictly secondary in Attica. Ca. 725 B.C. 171 Kantharos, Late Geometric. P1. 10. P 4775.

Late 7th century B.C. ONE-HANDLED CUPs (P1. 10). Geometric and Subgeometric, semi-black ware. The cup series has a plain line of development. The Geometric cups of the middle of the 8th century are fairly wide, with a full shoulder and a short rim (177). Thereafter they become deeper, have less of a shoul- der, and the rim begins to turn out (178). In the first half of the 7th century the cups have Subgeometric decor, are very deep in relation to their diameter and have a wide and very flaring rim (181). This trend culminates in the second quarter of the 7th century (183); thereafter it is reversed. In the third quarter of the 7th century cups are again lower and wider, the rim is shorter and well set off from the shoulder, and there is now a disk foot (184). The cups look in- creasingly as if copied from metal models, the fabric being thin and firm and the glaze firm, glossy and approaching classical black glaze (186). The last sur-</page><page sequence="63">CATALOGUE: PHALERON CUPS 53 vivals of the series (which does not continue into the 6th century as a line) are as low and broad as Mycen- aean metal cups (187). Contemporary with this last metallic phase is a cup with angled shoulder (188), evidently a bona fide copy from a metal prototype made exclusively in the second half of the 7th cen- tury s.c.

This group of small, usually decorated, cups is named after the Phaleron Cemetery where they were found in large number (A.J.A., XLVI, 1942, p. 46). The preferred shape is a flaring calyx (193) though cups with offset rim or rounded sides (191, 190) are also made. The commonest decoration is a wavy line around the body; sometimes the painting is more elaborate (192, 193), sometimes it is entirely lacking (189). It is almost always Late Geometric or Early Protoattic, thus showing that the bulk of these cups belong to the late 8th and early 7th century B.C. 177 Cup, Late Geometric. P1. 10. P 4982.

See p. 29 for the fabric. Though they have a long early history, in the second half of the 8th century the amphorae became both more shapely and more common. It was prob- ably at this time that they ceased to be used for cooking and began to be used for drawing water; for this latter purpose they were called kadoi in antiquity (Hesperia, XXVII, 1958, pp. 186-190). The examples of the later 8th century (195) have thin walls, a long body and band handles with a rather flat loop. All kadoi have the neck and the shoulder in one curve. Some variants in use in the late 8th or earlier 7th century are spouted (198, 199); these sometimes have incised decoration like cooking jugs. In the 7th century (200-202) the trend is toward a more visibly articulated ring foot, rolled handles arching out from the body contour, a more rounded body and a more flaring and more crisply finished rim. The same trend continues in the 6th century (P 18347). Main references: Brann, E-H, pp. 316-317, also Brann N 17. 195 Kados. P1. 11. P 23659. Well, Q 8:9. Brann N 17. H. 0.305 m.; diam. 0.215 m.

The deep jug, burnt down the front where it has stood on the edge of the hearth, is the principal shape made of cooking ware fabric. In the second half of the 8th century the jugs lose their former heaviness of fabric and their baggy shape to assume a more definite neck-shoulder curve and a fairly pointed body with small standing surface (203). At the same time large-sized jugs of similar shape are made; these usually have incised ornament and nipples on the shoulder (204). The jugs retain a band handle till after the middle of the 7th century (206). Towards the end of the century the rolled handle is used (208). Also toward the end of the century a round-bottomed shape is introduced (210) which prevails in the 6th century (P 18532). Main references: Brann E-H, p.317, Brann F 49ff., L 45.

This pot was found in the same deposit as the deep jug 209, and so must represent the time when the round bottomed pots were first introduced and used alongside the deeper jugs. The cause for their ap- pearance is very likely the increased use of cooking rings and braziers like 211 on which a round bottomed pot could be set securely, whereas before the jugs had to be propped against the curbing of the hearth. The round-bottomed shape existed in Corinthian Geometric (A.J.A., XXXV, 1931, p. 414, fig. 8), but there is no evidence for it in Athens during the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.

Though found 4.10 m. down in the well, the basin, which was wedged upright in the well shaft, may have been used as a makeshift well head. The weathering and pitting probably mark the height to which the basin was above ground in this use. A similar large basin was found in a Geometric well at Knossos just above the use level, B.S.A., LV, 1960, p. 159. Also in Well R 17:5 the well head 604 was found low in the well just above the use level; the presumption is therefore that well heads were broken up and thrown in as soon as wells went out of use.

The various im- ported wares are only sporadically represented, so that a summary of shapes need be given only for Argive monochrome ware, which occurs regularly in Agora groups. The fabric of Argive monochrome ware is beige to buff in color, smooth to the touch and light. Great quantities of the ware are found in the Argolis and at Corinth, and these places were undoubtedly the cen- ters of production, though similar ware seems to have been made locally at Athens. It is hard to distinguish actual imports from the local product; presumably the coarser and less yellow the fabric, the greater the likelihood of Attic origin. The predominant shape in Attica is the oinochoe which comes in three variants: trefoil-mouthed, wide-necked with a spherical body (235); round- mouthed, narrow-necked, same body (231, 233); squat-bottomed (232). All of these can be contempo- rary (as for instance those in Keranmcikos, V, 1, pl. 156, bottom row) nor do the shapes change much with time (cf. 231 and 233, a hundred years apart).

There is certainly nothing surprising in 7th century imports from Egypt; presumably perfume would be sent in them; C. H. E. Haspels, Attic Black-figured Lekythoi, Paris, 1936, p. 126, refers to jugs bearing names of perfumes; one of these, also a handleless aryballos, bears the name of the Egyptian perfume Kypros. An Egyptian metal vase, another possible import, seems to be depicted on the neck of a Theran amphora, Ath. Mitt., XXVIII, 1903, Beil. V, 2: cf. W. S. Smith, Ancient Egypt, Boston, 1952, p. 151, fig. 92, made between 751-656 B.C. It should be noted, however, that the Agora pots resemble lydions, except that they are footless; cf.

Ohly, Goldbleche, p. 116 points out the similarity between such Dipylon does and those on the goldbands as a proof that the latter were indigenous to Attica. Just after 750 B.c. GRAVE GROUP (PI. 15). Nos. 250-269 are from a woman's grave in the Geometric Cemetery (G 12:17 Young XVII); this is the richest grave found in the Agora area and is among the earliest in the cemetery. The contents were made at the time when the Dipylon Master painted. Most of them clearly come from one work- shop. They should be dated about or shortly after 750 B.C. The metal objects including bronze and iron fibulae are not shown here, but can be seen in Young, fig.. 73. No contemporary graves of quite this richness and uniform level of workmanship from the Kerameikos exist, but comparable single items are cited in ad- dition to Young's references. The grave illustrates the remarkable variety of shape, size and decoration of the pyxides of this period. The pyxis shape is not one with a very clear development. Actually only two stages can be clearly distinguished; that of Middle Geometric Grave I 18:1 (Hesperia XVII, 1948, p. 158, pl. 41, 1) where they are small, with zigzags, maeander, and dots running around the body, and usually have their bottoms unpainted, and that of this grave, where they have all dimensions from miniature to out-size, where panel decoration prevails and where the bottoms are often decorated. Note, however, that pyxides like 253, 254 are scarcely distinguishable from their earlier counterparts. Third quarter of the 8th century B.C. 250 Amphoriskos. P1. 15. P 5052. Grave, G 12:17.

A basket of the sort which might be used to make such bowls is here shown. It is much coarser than that used for the Geometric bowl; such fine baskets are not made in modern Greece, but are imported from' Japan.

The little wooden knob illustrated here was turned on a lathe, and shows how close to woodworking certain features of Middle Geometric are. That pyxis knobs may have originated in turned woodwork was observed by Jacobsthal, Greek Pins, p. 40. Observations complementary to this are con- tained in H. A. Thompson's unpublished article on the origin of Geometric pottery in basketry (Sum- mary in A.J.A., L, 1946, p. 286; on file at the In- stitute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey). There it is shown that the pyxis shape is at home in basketwork (and, it might be pointed out, the fact that in pottery it has had no regular shape develop- ment nor a recognizable function shows it to be alien to that medium). Attention is drawn particularly to the radial design on the bottom of pyxides (e. g. 268) as being a rendering of the radiating staves which are used in plaiting the basket bottom. Other Geo- metric ornament is also particularly reminiscent of basketry, such as checkerboard pattern, maeanders, and all sorts of running Geometrio friezes. These ornaments in basketry and its pottery counterparts are beautifully illustrated in W. von Wersin and W. Muiller-Graf, Das elementare Ornament und seine Gesetzlichkeit, Ravensburg, 1940, pls. 64ff.; (for Attic baskets see Hesperia, XXVII, 1958, pp. 264-275, pl. 51). It should be noted that H. A. Thompson's obser- vations hold best in regard to Middle Geometric; by Late Geometric times the Geometric manner had become a school of ceramic thought. To return to the knob, if the pyxides were origin- ally baskets, their handles were probably made of wood, hence the similarity to woodwork.

The persistence of tondo schemes is illustrated by R.

Such copies were evidently made more in Crete than in Athens, e. g. Hesperia, XIV, 1945, pl. XI, 2; Annuario, XXXIII-XXXIV, 1955-1956, p. 235, fig. 28, both with griffins; also the terracotta shield-bosses, Kunze, Bronzereliefs, pl. 52, a, b, lions. See also under the griffin protome Burr 330; Arch. Anz., XLVIII, 1933, p. 274, fig. 9. The lions are undoubtedly Attic, exact plastic versions of those on the Analatos krater, OVA Munich 3, pl. 130. Though no Attic lion cauldrons are known, the cauldron- headed gorgons of the Polyphemos Amphora (My- lonas, Eleusis Amphora, pl. B) give a good idea of what these looked like.

The ornament in the top zone is a component of one used by the Polyphemos Painter, Mylonas, Eleusis Amphora, p. 35, fig. 17, no. 5, p. 36 (interpreted as a pomegranate). This is a nice detail to confirm a Mesogeia-Polyphemos Painter line of development to parallel the Analatos-Ram Jug Painter connection.

A small group by some other, careless followers of the Vulture Painter: CVA Vienna 1, pl. 3, 3-4, a standed bowl; CVA Cambridge 2,111 H, pl. XV, 9, a jug; Kiibler, Alt. Mal., p. 7, fig. 2, a kotyle, close; see also under 431. These Attic ibexes have apparently no direct relation to the popular Rhodian wild goats which are not only a different species but appear later (W. Schie- ring, Werkstaitte der orientalisierenden Keramik auf Rhodos, Berlin, 1957, p. 43); furthermore the Attic animals are ibexes, the Rhodian are goats (see E. D. Van Buren, The Fauna of Ancient Mesopotamia as Represented in Art, Rome, 1939, pp. 49ff., figs. 51-52). It is hard to decide whether these 7th century walking ibexes are directly descended in Attica from the Geometric "ramass6" goat so popular with the Dipylon Master and the Hirschfeld Painter or are the result of the orientalizing movement; the latter seems more likely since there are no Geometric walking</page><page sequence="91">CATALOGUE: POTTERY BY PAINTING STYLES 81 goats.

On body, left to right, three pairs of motifs: two labyrinth-like maeander patterns, dotted; a rosette tree with black and white petals and a tree of life in outline with black lotus finial; a pair of prancing horses with open mouths, manes and tails in outline. Four lines and broad band on base. Black glaze, very worn. For the olpe shape, see p. 40. The horses are in gallop, cf. 410, Hesperia, XIV, 1945, pl. V, 1, Cretan hydria. Heads spread out, as it were, on the neck occur on the New York Nessos Amphora, J.H.S., XXXII, 1912, pl. XII and 440 (horses of this type, both Cycladic and Attic, are illustrated in A.J.A., LIX, 1955, pl. 32). The long locks of the mane are prevalent early in Cycladic (e.g. Ddlos, XVII, passim and the delicate little horses B.S.A., XLIV, 1949, pp. 19-21, pl. 8, 4-5), and probably come from there. The breast strap becomes usual in Middle Protoattic. The "tree of life" occurs in similar versions on Proto- corinthian and Cretan pots, e.g. Kunze, Bronzereliefs, p. 149, Beil. 3, e; Brock, Fortetsa, pl. 64, 1. The bud ends and the finial are apparently irises, see M. M6bius on Minoan plant life, Jahrb., XLVIII, 1933, p. 11, fig. 5, F. As for the palmette tree, such trees with long shoots are found on Phoenician ivories, see C. Decamps de Mertzenfeld, Ivoires phe'niciens, Paris, 1954, pl. CXIX, no. 1059, from Assur. Ours is very much Atticized. The step maeander: high maeanders are used in Attic Geometric, e.g. CVA University of California 1, III H, pl. II. Ours is a late and variant version, actually a high maeander sequence up-ended. Such maeander systems are especially popular on the islands, see Ath. Mitt., LXIII, 1933, p. 99, fig. 41, from Samos. The dotted strands occur on Corinthian and Island pottery; they have their origin in a metal fillet ornament, see Ohly, Goldbleche, pl. 17. The labyrinth ornament is a trompe d'oeil, con- sisting of one strand going up on the left and coming down on the right and overlapping in the center so as to form swastikas (similar swastikas occur in Etruscan work, see A. Akerstr6m, Der geometrische Stil in Italien, Lund, 1943, p. 142, figs. 50-51, no really obvious connection with Attic ornament). The system is not quite a labyrinth (for a real contempo- rary labyrinth see K. Kerenyi, Labyrinth-Studien, Zurich, 1950, pp. 34-35, 46, fig. 11) but merely a labyrinthine ornament, for which see R. Eilmann, Labyrinthos, Athens, 1931, pp. 38ff. (early maeander systems). It is amazing that so fine a piece should be so hard to assign to a workshop. In general there is Island influence, and what amounts to the same thing, a connection with the delicate style of Early</page><page sequence="97">CATALOGUE: POTTERY BY PAINTING STYLES 87 Protoattic and the miniature style for which see p. 21.

The following refer- ences (except the first) appeared after the Burr article: I.L.N., Sept. 3, 1932, p. 345 in color, the blue appears a little too green. E. Kunze, "Zeusbilder in Olympia," Antike und Abendland, II, 1946, p. 99, considers it certain that the figure on the plaque is a goddess rather than an adorant, the gesture one of epiphany, i.e. how the revealed god appears to men. H. L. Lorimer, Homer and the Monuments, London, 1950, p. 398. E. Bielefeld, "G6tterstatuen auf attischen Vasenbildern," Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Ernst Moritz Arndt-Universitlit Greifswald, IV, 1954-1955, p. 387, note 48, b; provenience citation should read "Agora Museum, from the Areopagus region." A strikingly close parallel to the profile view of the Goddess is the Ram Jug sherd, B.S.A., XXXV, 1934-1935, pl. 55, b. A head jug from Kameiros, J.H.S., LXVIII, 1948, p. 17, pl. XII, a, b, of the same date as the plaque illustrates the close con- nection of the Middle Protoattic high style with the East Greek manner. The head vase in Payne, NC, pl. 47, 4-5, on the other hand, shows the fundamental difference between the Attic and contemporary Corinthian faces; to contrast the front view, cf. the detail of the Chigi Vase in Ath. Mitt., XLIV, 1919, pl. V, 21. Typologically the plaque head belongs to the Middle Daedalic style in which the hair is divided vertically, see R. J. H., Jenkins, Dedalica, Cambridge, 1936. The style of the whole plaque would be that of the Ram Jug Painter at his acme, and before the more developed plastic Kerameikos pots, Arch. Anz., XLVIII, 1933, pp. 271-274, figs. 6-10. The name of the goddess remains unknown. The fact that shields were evidently offered to her gives no clue to her identity; for similar votives come from, to give only some mainland examples, Eleusis and the dromos of the tomb at Menidi (Jahrb., XIV, 1899, pp. 118ff.); in and from the temple of Hera at Tiryns (Lorimer, Homer and the Monuments, p. 170, pls. IX, X). The snakes do not help, for these may ac- company a potnia theron as on the Boeotian pinax (Jahrb., III, 1888, illustrated on p. 357), or Athena (M. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion, Lund, 1950, pp. 496ff.) or some old chthonic goddess. Nor do other con- temporary representations help, for the only well attested goddess in 7th century Attic vase painting is the Athena with a spear on the Eleusis amphora, who may be a representation of a 7th century statue (E.

It shows strong outside influence; it is in fact a pastiche and a travesty of the Protocorinthian and East Greek typology. The rim ornament is that used on Proto- corinthian kotylai (see under 525) where hare and hound chases are frequent enough. The dogs, how- ever, approximate the boar-shaped East Greek type, e. g.

Similar lotus ornament occurs again on the Nessos amphora, CVA Berlin 1, pl. 5, 1-2, and even closer, on the neck of 543 (= 53). The Polyphemos Painter uses ornament typologically close, but much more slender. It is apparently copied from the plastic decoration on orientalizing metal bowls, see Jacobs- thal, Greek Pins, p. 47, ills. 209-218. The dotted triangles are typical of the Ram Jug Painter's orna- ment; the smooth emphatic figure of the bird shows his hand. Birds do not appear much on his recognized works; only 'APX. 'Eq., 1952, pp. 150-151, figs. 12, 14.

By the Ram Jug Painter (for whose work see 'ApX. 'Eq)., 1952, p. 166) and one of his finest works. Cf. especially the faces of the Ram Jug in Kraiker, Aigina, pls. 44-45. The floral ornament, one of the few self-contained ones in Protoattic, is composed of favorite elements among the Ram Jug Painter's ornaments: the sword-shaped multi-foil, the stuffed palmette (CVA Berlin 1, pl. 17, 1; Kraiker, Aigina, pl. 41, 586), the tongue-spandrel. As is to be expected in this painter, the floral motif is closer to Cycladic (e. g. De'los, XVII, pl. XII, b) than to Protocorinthian systems which are, at least until the Corinthian period, rather meagre since the preferred ornament runs to delicate friezes on the one hand and bold loop- and-tendril growths on the other (see Johansen, V.S., pp. 115ff.). The sphinxes' wings are of the Attic and Island rather than the Corinthian variety, i. e., pointed and with striations rather than sickle shaped and with tongue-shaped feathers. The left one is in black-figure, the right one in outline technique, and this illustrates the Ram Jug Painter's position at the acme of Protoattic with both the Corinthian and the Island techniques at his command. The long, strong- chinned faces are comparable to those of the Kera- meikos terracotta sphinxes, Arch. Anz., XLVIII, 1933, p. 271, figs. 6, 7. Other Ram Jug sphinxes, earlier: 539; 'APX.

Bull., 1942-1943, pp. 81ff., figs. 4-5, which is contemporary. Since the curve of the fragment indicates that it is from the bottom of the neck, the interpretation of the figure becomes an interesting matter. It could be merely a protome, but much speaks for it being a bearded siren, the earliest in Athens before 590: the squatness of the figure, the rounded chest, the long hair. The black-figure bearded sirens, CVA Athens 2, III H g, pl. 15, 2-3, show how all these features apply. Unfortunately the earliest sirens elsewhere are not good parallels (E. Kunze, "Sirenen," Ath., Mitt., LVII, 1932, p. 126). For early bearded sirens see E. Buschor, Musen des Jenseits, 1944, pls. 21ff., figs. 7-11. The dipinto remains un- explained.

(Not illustrated: fragment of collar rim, fragment with woman's curled bob.) Diepolder, who publishes the piece in the Weickert Festschrift, thinks it may well be a very early work of the Nessos Painter and that it belongs to the school of outline painting represented in the preceding gen- eration by the Ram Jug Painter (ibid., p. 118, figs. 5-7). He considers it to be contemporary with k</page><page sequence="108">98 CATALOGUE: POTTERY BY PAINTING STYLES the Kerameikos rider amphora (ibid., p. 115, fig. 3) and the New York Kouros, and dates it ca. 620 B.C., but the ascription is not easy to support, and the date seems a little too late. The next succeeding woman amphora is that in CVA Munich 1, pls. 1, 2. The achievement represented by the fragment is the introduction of the picture panel on a monumental scale; S. Karouzou, The Amasis Painter, Oxford, 1956, Appendix 1, p. 42, points out that it was prob- ably the Ram Jug Painter who introduced this device into Athens and the Nessos Painter who first applied it to the one-piece amphora; ornament panels, how- ever, occur on such amphorae before him, see 514, 21.

Black glaze, very worn. Although this neck exhibits a full incision tech- nique, it shows enough early features to be presented here as the last Protoattic piece. Its rolled rim is early; black-figure amphorae have collar rims (Kiubler, Alt. Mal., p. 80, figs. 84-85). Its figures do not show any standardized typology. The bearded sphinx (for an earlier one see 577) does not have the standard scheme, i. e. one wing in front, one behind for which see B.S.A., XXXV, 1934-1935, pl. 60, but has both wings buckled on in front. This is an earlier scheme to be seen on Middle Protoattic flying birds; see Mylonas, Eleusis Amphora, pl. 10. The horse's belly incision is not quite intelligible; its lumbering gait is reminiscent of Early Protoattic horses. The "Knickerbocker" leg as well as a hook-and-blob ornament occur on the Kynosarges amphora, CVA Athens 2, pls. 3-4. The fragment, CVA Berlin 1, pl. 48, 2, is of the same awkward style.

The use of yellow-white paint on a dark background is popular in Geometric Corinth (Hesperia, XVII, 1948, pls. LXXIII-LXXIV), and in Crete (Brock, Fortetsa, passim).

E. Klein, Child Life in Greek Art, New York, 1932, frontispiece). The objects are basically standed bowls, with a hole cut into the side of the bowl for the baby's legs. In the bottom of the bowl is another large round hole. In the side of the stand are smaller holes, no doubt to facilitate lifting. Others: Brann F 18, H 16.

Cooking stands are old and ubiquitous appliances, e. g. Archaeology, VIII, 1955, p. 165, fig. 4, Yugo- slavian Bronze Age; E. Gjerstad, Early Rome, I, Lund, 1953, p. 47, figs. 26-28, p. 94; both of these have a perforated standing surface rather than a flanged supporting rim. They do not, however, seem to have been used in Athens before the 7th century. A whole 7th century example: 211; 6th century, Hesperia, XXV, 1956, pl. 17, b, stand and round- bottomed pot.

This leg must come from such a pot.

Misfired. 633-635 are trial pieces from the same group as the potter's refuse 628-632. Such pieces were pre- pared from unfired defective pots. A hole was cut in the side and a sampling of glaze was put on the fragment. A batch was then put in the kiln and single trial pieces were withdrawn with a hook at different times from a special opening. Thus the progress of the firing could be tested without opening the kiln. A similar but larger collection was found in the Proto- geometric Well L 11:1, q. v. for a discussion.

The evidence consists for the most part of the pottery published in this volume. For the general topography of early Athens see I. Travlos, lTTooboSIKl 'ET ,i&amp;ts rv 'AelvGv Athens, 1960, pp. 19ff. WELLS The numerous wells and their copious fillings are a unique contribution of the Agora area to pre-archaic archaeology.

Section through a typical Well appears as a roughly round pit or funnel containing a fill of crumbled bedrock and field stones.

Real curbing does not occur</page><page sequence="118">108 TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: WELLS in the early wells. The pottery at the top is accordingly sparse. Lower down, the shaft is usually well preserved. It has a diameter of 1 m.-1.50 m., which is just enough to allow a man to move. Sometimes there are footholds on the sides. The depth ranges from 3 m. to 21 m. (the latter depth occurs on the Kolonos Agoraios), but it is usually between 4 m. and 7 m. Through most of its depth the shaft is normally filled with uniform, that is to say unstratified, fill which evidently had been dumped all at the same time when the well was abandoned, obviously to prevent people from falling in. Much of the most interesting pottery, especially the sherds of fine figured pottery, comes from this dumped fill. It was very probably carted from near-by rubbish heaps or swept together from local debris. It contains, therefore, the disiecta membra of the furnishings of the neighborhood pantries, kitchens, courtyards, burial plots and sanc- tuaries, but from the latter two there are only the most fragmentary remains. In particular, pyxides, the grave pottery par excellence, are almost totally absent. Below this dumped fill, at the bottom of the well, lies the use fill. If the well was a good one, with plentiful water and firm shaft walls, it was used for a long time. This, then, is evident from the copious accumulation of mud and often complete water jars which had fallen in, perhaps because they had been knocked over the curbing or shattered against the side of the shaft when let down, or because the well rope had broken. This well ware is usually simply banded, see pp. 34-35. Sometimes the well head is found on top of this use filling; evidently it had been knocked apart and dropped into the shaft as the first step in putting the well out of commission, The well head consisted of the top of a pithos or the upper part of a basin (e. g. 223) until the third quarter of the 7th century; at that date drum-shaped well heads were invented (604). Both the location and the date of the closing of the Late Geometric and Protoattic wells are of interest. They are indicated on the Deposit Map, Plate 45. The wells are scattered over the whole area with a special concentration beneath the center of the later Agora. The existence of a well presumably indicates the existence of a house which it served, so it is reasonable to assume that the Agora area was rather thickly populated in the late 8th and 7th centuries B.C. An unusually large number of wells were closed in the late 8th century (Brann, Wells I-R). The reason for this is unknown. A natural explanation would be that the level of the water table dropped in a time of drought and that the wells failed. A more hazardous one would be to connect the closing with some war or invasion such as was responsible for the filling of wells during the Persian wars (Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, p. 52; XXIV, 1955, p. 62). This is not entirely out of the question, for it is clear that Athens suffered some setback at the time which resulted in the loss of her navy and in a temporary provincialization of her trade and industry.Dunbabin (B.S.A., XXXVII, 1936-1937, pp. 83ff.) ascribes this 7th century decline to a war with Aegina. The evidence from the wells indicates that poor people lived in the Agora area in the 8th and 7th century, for as the close spacing of the wells shows that plots were small, so their contents show that the houses were not splendidly furnished; especially the pots of Sub- geometric style (see p. 17) are clearly poor man's goods. The evidence of the local cemetery plots (see below) supports this; the area south of the Eridanos could not compete in magnificence with the nobles' burial plots such as are known at the Kerameikos and Anargyros (see Arch. Anz., LV, 1940, pp. 175f.) and Anavyssos. The latest of all the wells in what was later the central open Agora area proper (M 11:3, Brann Well H) was closed ca. 600 B.C.; thereafter no new wells were sunk here and the area was cleared of private dwellings to serve as the official market place of Athens. The descent of the Agora from the Areopagus-Acropolis saddle (Travlos, op. cit., pl. 1) to the more easily accessible level land marked the spreading of the city area and the commercial recovery of Athens which can be seen also in the appearance of the newly perfected black-figure ware all over the Mediterranean (Bailey, J.H.S., LX, 1940, pp. 60ff.).</page><page sequence="119">TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: HOUSES 109 HoUSES While sealed wells are fairly indestructible, the houses they served have not survived. In fact, the only structural remains earlier than 600 B.C. are vestiges of two houses, one of the 8th, the other of the 7th century B.C. The Geometric house was published in detail by D. Burr in Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 542-640. It lies in H 17 at the north foot of the Areopagus. Some stretches of the curved wall built of small untrimmed stones could be restored to form the asymmetrically elliptical house plan (11 m. x 5 m.), oriented east and west, shown in Figure 8.

Geometric House at North Foot of Areopagus away from the hill, was more solidly built. Parts of the floor of hard-packed earth and remains of stone erections, probably benches, against the walls were preserved. A burnt area near the center indicated the position of a hearth.' The house must have been part of a complex, for another house wall, in use contemporaneously with the oval house, ran up to it at the south- eastern end (Wall AA on p. 544, fig. 2). Against its western side, as it had been left when the house was abandoned, stood 40 (Burr 37), datable to the early third quarter of the 8th century B.C. The most characteristic pieces from the fill over the floors and the fallen house walls (Burr 28-96, for a selection of these see 290-291, 314, 637) are of the late third quarter of the 8th century B.C., though there are many earlier scraps (see Deposit Summary, H 17:4).2 1 Add to the references in Burr: Geometric house models, Payne, Perachora, pp. 34-51 (with a note on the construction of primitive houses); Cretan Geometric house model, B.S.A., XLIX, 1954, p. 221, fig. 5; Geometric houses in Siphnos, B.S.A., XLIV, 1949, pp. 6ff.; Geometric hut model, 867. None of these are elliptical, but the Perachora models are apsidal, and the hut models are round in plan. 2 The excavational evidence and our Geometric dating corroborate each other nicely. D. Burr, dating 40 according to the early chronology then current to the early 8th century, observed that this left a gap of almost a hundred years between the desertion of the house and its destruction. She thought this unlikely and suspected the pottery chronology of being faulty. The chronology has since been corrected on independent stylistic grounds.</page><page sequence="120">110 TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: WORKSHOPS The house was therefore abandoned in the third quarter of the 8th century and was shortly thereafter in ruins.3 The house of the 7th century is published in Hesperia Supplement IV, p. 3, Building A. It was a long narrow structure running roughly east-west and fronting a street on the south, as shown in Figure 9. It shared its west wall as a party wall with the Late Geometric Cemetery THOLO0 SA KILN "000" 0, o 104 45 20 I- _ _ _.... ... . L ':":_ i. _ - Fig. 9. 7th Century House and Tholos Cemetery (Geometric) (see below). It consisted of a complex of closed rooms and court yards, lightly built of field stones bedded in clay, though the best preserved room, the rectangular one at the southwest, had a rather more massive front wall which served as retaining wall against the street as well as roof support; this room had a packed earth floor. The foundations of the house were set in an accumulation which yielded pottery of ca. 700 B.C. (H 12:8, here 341-342), and this must be when the house was built. In the house was a kiln (see below) which was abandoned along with the house; sherds from its destruction filling (H 12:17, here 164, 398, 554) are datable to the second and third quarters of the 7th century B.C. Houses shown by the pottery from below their floors to have been built in the late 7th or early 6th century B.C. were found beneath the South Road which runs along the lower slopes of the Areopagus up to this day (Hesperia, XXV, 1956, p. 48, pl. 12 b, c). These were destroyed in the enlargement of the Agora which took place in the second half of the 6th century B.C. WORKSHOPS The existence of workshops which were attached to the humble dwellings in the Agora area can be inferred from the composition of some of the deposits and is corroborated by the finding of an actual kiln in the 7th century house; a plan of the kiln is given in Hesperia, Supplement IV, p. 6, fig. 5. A potter's workshop deposit (S 17:2) and a well (R 17:5, Brann Well S) probably belonging to that shop were found on the opposite side of the Agora area in S - R 17. The deposit con- 3 Its date of erection is more difficult to fix, except that it is probably before 800 B.c. An Early Geometric child's grave was found under the floor level of the house (H 17:2). Unfortunately the pottery from within the floor of the house (ibid. A, p. 555, fig. 12) is not distinguishable in date from that of the grave, and though it is likely that the grave was there before the house it is not certain that it was not sunk through the house floor, which was disturbed in this area.</page><page sequence="121">TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: SANCTUARIES 111 tained trial pieces (633-635) and pottery refuse (628-632) and numerous little terracottas; the well had in it a great many tools such as pounders and scrapers, and lumps of red ochre such as was used in making the added red on Attic pottery. Scrapers, grinders, mortars, basins, loomweights, etc. are of course found in most of the wells but are probably merely signs of home industry. SANCTUARIES The existence of sanctuaries may likewise be inferred from the deposits. In particular the Votive Deposit found close to the Geometric house (Burr 97ff., P1. 30) is evidence of a local shrine of which it is the refuse. Although an icon of its deity has survived (493)4 and although it is clear that she was a chthonic goddess, we know neither her name nor the precise location of her shrine. A similar votive deposit was found on the slopes below the Eleusinion (T 19:3, T 20:2), and another beneath the north central part of the Agora (Hesperia, XXVII, 1958, pp. 148-153). Some, perhaps all, of these deposits may derive from cults of the dead established in connection with the early tombs in the area. CEMETERIES Numerous grave plots, perhaps amounting to a continuous cemetery, lined the upper east to west road which traversed the northern slopes of the Areopagus (see Deposit Map, P1. 45). Most of these were earlier than 750 B.C. and will be discussed by E. L. Smithson. Much of the early admixture of pottery in the fill over the Geometric house must have come from these plots. The richest Geometric complex found in the Agora area is the Late Geometric grave precinct to the south of the classical Tholos. Since it is presented in detail in Hesperia, Supplement II, only the briefest summary will be given here. The burial ground was a terrace at the south- eastern side of Kolonos Agoraios (Fig. 9) supported by a retaining wall of the Geometric period built of untrimmed blocks of limestone. The Geometric date of the wall is assured by the fact that the burnt remains of a funeral pyre made in the precinct about 725 B.C. (G 12:19, Young Grave XII, represented here by 336-338) had been thrown over the wall on to the street below; since this material lay against the wall, the wall must be earlier. Twenty burials were found in this terrace (G 12:1-5, 7-19, 24-25; F 12:1; F-G 12:3) ranging in date from ca. 750 to ca. 700; the earliest grave, which was also the richest, is G 12:17 (Young, Grave XVII, here P1. 15); the latest is G 12:4 (Young, Grave IV, represented by 344). These dates will be found to be earlier by a quarter century than those proposed by Young; this is consonant with the chronology followed throughout this book and explained on pp. 4-8. Though the area of the cemetery seems to have been respected throughout the 7th century, it fell into disuse early, while the adjoining house was still flourishing. Two child burials were made in the precinct in the early 6th century (G 12:18, 1, Young Graves I, II), but there is no sign of any other use after 700 B.C. The graves in the cemetery were laid out more with a view to economy of space than in accordance with any fixed rule of orientation. One row of graves radiated out from Kolonos Agoraios; another was laid across the ends of the first. The fact that adult and child burials were mixed and that the precinct was tightly filled up suggested that it was a family burial plot. This was corroborated by J. L. Angel's analysis of the skeletal remains which revealed a striking uniformity of physical type which could best be explained by blood relationship (Hesperia, Supplement II, pp. 236-246). 4 E. Kunze, "Zeusbilder in Olympia," Antike und Abendland, II, 1946, p. 99, is certain that the figure on the plaque is a goddess making a gesture of epiphany rather than an adorant.</page><page sequence="122">112 TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: CEMETERIES The plot yielded much evidence for funeral and burial customs which is discussed in Hesperia, Supplement II, pp. 18-20 and in the Deposit Summary. Briefly, there were two kinds of burials: children's urn burials and adult inhumations. Small children were buried in pithoi, amphorae and hydriai. If the neck was too narrow for insertion of the body, part of the wall of the pot was cut out for the purpose and later replaced. The children were laid in a bent position on their sides with knees drawn up; and the urn was placed in a pit without any particular orientation. Offerings of pots and sometimes food were placed in the urn which was then closed with a stone or a small suitable pot. Sometimes more offerings of pots were placed outside; there were a number of pits in which coarse ware jugs, which may have contained liquid offerings of milk and honey, stood upright outside the urns. After the urn and all offerings had been deposited the pit was filled with earth. The adult inhumations were shaft burials, similar to those found at the Dipylon. Rectangular shafts ca. 2.00 x 0.50 m. were sunk into the terrace. The body was laid out on the floor, generally on its back with arms at the sides and legs straight; then the offerings were put in place-in the women's graves wherever there was room, in the men's graves over the feet; drinking vessels and weapons were characteristic for the men, pyxides and jewelry for women. It is noteworthy that the two richest graves, G 12:17 and G 12:9 (Young Graves XVII, XVIII) were women's burials. After the offerings had been put in, the graves were filled with earth and covered with slabs of green shale laid across the width of the shafts. These covers rested on ledges about 0.50 m. below the surface of the terrace; the shaft floor was again 0.50 m. below them. Unless there were wooden markers, there seem to have been no grave monuments at all, in contrast to the great pots put over graves in the Kerameikos.5 There was evidence also of the funerary rites practised in this cemetery. Some of the graves contained thick layers of ash with bits of animal bones, also burnt pots which sometimes joined fragments of pots found in similar burnt deposits outside the grave. Evidently a funeral banquet was prepared and eaten close by the grave while it was yet open. Two pyre deposits (G 12:24 and G 12:19; Young Graves XI, XII) contained what was clearly ritual pottery, particularly an amphora on the neck of which the funeral ritual is depicted (336): men carrying objects for use at the funeral, namely a wreath for the dead, a knife for the sacrifice or a sword for the dead man6 and a thymiaterion for burning incense. Other vases from the pyres may have contained oil, wine and perfume as is reported in Iliad XXIII, 166ff. to have been used in Patroklos' funeral. A second burial area is the Archaic Cemetery on the west slope of the Areopagus published in Hesperia, XX, 1951, pp. 69-134. Its peribolos wall dates from the 6th century B.C., but there were earlier burials in the plot, of which a very few were preserved in situ (ibid., pp. 77-78, B 21:10, 23, 2). There were also many little plots and single graves scattered throughout the Agora area. Their publication is completed in Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 402-416; see also the Deposit Map, Plate 45. Some of these were set down among the wells that attest habitation, and were quickly forgotten. Such must have been the case with the Late Geometric grave N 11:1 which had been sunk into the mouth of a Late Geometric well (N 11:5) which in turn contained the remains of a Late Geometric grave. 1 For a lucid summary of the Kerameikos cemeteries see G. Karo, An Attic Cemetery, Philadelphia, 1943, pp. 9-12. He points out that the graves found in the German excavations are actually those of the poorer people; the great pots came from the Greek excavations near the Dipylon Gate. 6 The latter is perhaps the more likely explanation, for swords were offered along with --wreaths, see the Benaki amphora, B.S.A., XLII, 1947, pl. 19, and the very similar fragment, Graef, Akropolis Vasen, pl. 10, 295. For biblio- graphy on prothesis scenes see H. Marwitz, "Ein attisch-geometrischer Krater in New York," Antike Kunst, IV, 1961, pp. 89-47.</page><page sequence="123">TOPOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS: ROADS 113 This same grave N 11:1 is also the latest found in the central Agora area. After the late 8th century burials were evidently no longer made here, not it would seem on account of any interdict against sepulturae intra urbem, for burials were made in the Archaic Cemetery through- out the 6th century, but because this quarter had become too crowded to afford room for the dead (Hesperia, XX, 1951, pp. 131ff.). The cemetery of the rich at this time was in the Kera- meikos; see Karo, An Attic Cemetery, pp. 13-16, pls. 13, 14a, and Kerameikos, VI, 1, pp. 95 ff. The sequence of grave plots bears witness to the expansion of the city. The process seems to have been in the nature of a linkage of different early settlements rather than a fanning out from the hub of the Acropolis. The Areopagus plots are mostly earlier than 750 B.C. After 750 one family at least had chosen a burial plot farther to the north, namely, the proprietors of the Late Geometric Cemetery. At the same time the families who had buried in the Kera- meikos and presumably lived near the Eridanos expanded their burial space to the south and east and one may suppose that their living quarters expanded in the same direction (Kera- meikos, V, 1, pp. 4-5). Other outlying settlements like those at Nea Ionia or on Tourkovouni, in Kynosarges and on the south slope of the Acropolis must have moved in a similar way. By the 7th century the central Agora area was a solid dwelling quarter and the main burial plots preserved to us lie in the north, in the Outer Kerameikos (Kerameikos, VI, 1, passim). ROADS The roads of the Geometric period can be traced by the graves that presumably lined the roadside in this period as in later times (see Deposit Map, P1. 45) and by patches of road metal that are preserved. The mapping of the roads is aided by the fact that traffic is very conservative, and a good path, once established, continues in use, often into modern times. Such road lines are marked out by graves especially on the slopes of the Areopagus and near the crossroads at the southwest entrance into the Agora (Graves E 19:1, 2, 3; Hesperia, XVIII, 1949, pp. 275-280). Road metal containing early sherds has been found in these places: on the South Road along the lower slopes of the Areopagus (Hesperia, XXV, 1956, p. 47); along the terrace wall of the Geometric Cemetery and the 7th century house (F-G 12:1, Hesperia, Supplement II, pp. 8ff., fig. 2; H 12:9, I 9:1, Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 5; Hesperia, Supplement IV, p. 106). These deposits come from the road which ran along the base of Kolonos Agoraios, see Plate 45; from streets in the pass between the Pnyx and the Areopagus (Hesperia, XX, 1951, pp. 69, 145, 150, 161; also Hesperia, XVIII, 1949, pp. 275-276); from a path ascending the north slope of the Areopagus over the ruins of the Geometric house (Hesperia, II, 1933, p. 550).</page><page sequence="124">CONCORDANCE The published pottery of the late 8th and 7th centuries is listed here by inventory number; the main publication reference follows.

The presence of ochre, of trial pieces (633-635) and of lumps of burnt clay suggest that both cuttings contained refuse from a near-by work- shop. This was probably the same establishment to which the well R 17:5 belonged. Second half of 7th century B.C. 78, 103, 109, 512, 529, 548, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635. S 18:1 Well; Brann Well L, Hesperia, XXX, 1961, pp. 117-125. Depth 8.90 m. Use fill distinguishable but not pure. Later 8th century B.C. 9, 30, 39, 43, 136, 144, 204, 299, 307, 476, 619. S 19:7 Well. Depth 10.50 min. (shaft preserved from 4 min.); diam. 0.97 min.; at 8.50 m. sand and mud; water level 8 min.; use filling at 7 min.: 196, 198, 218, 492, P 12290, P 14210, late 8th to second quarter 7th century B.c. Upper part of shaft filled with pure collapsed bedrock; the collapse of the well formed a pit which was filled with uniform dumped material, including a Submycenaean lekythos nearly complete (P 14212) and P 12173, P 14211-4, T 1915, first half of 7th century B.C. 88, 120, 196, 198, 218, 492. S 21:2 Well; first quarter into second quarter of the 6th century B.C. T 19:1 Well; second half of 6th century B.C. 277. T 19:3 Pit or well; Howland, Greek Lamps, p. 245. Pocket in the side of a Turkish pit in the area of the Eleusinion. No stratification. No water. To judge by the votive terracottas (T 1499-1503) this was a votive deposit, perhaps to be associated with another dis- turbed one farther south (T 20:2). 55 is earlier than the rest of the deposit. Later 8th to mid 7th cen- turies B.C.; mostly early Protoattic. 17, 26, 55, 61, 96, 106, 119, 139, 159, 163, 182, 194, 199, 301,310, 346, 384, 403, 416, 485, 517, 520, 559, 614, 616, 623. T 20:2 Circular cuttings in bedrock. Mixed fill (Gray Minyan to Byzantine) but dominance of terra- cotta figurines (T 1459-1461) makes it likely that this was a votive deposit. See T 19:3. 546.
