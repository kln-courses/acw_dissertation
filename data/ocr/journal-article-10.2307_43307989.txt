Only . . . recognition . . . what haunts the heart will, when it is found, leap foremost, blinding the eye and leaving the main of Life in darkness." ( Titus Groan, 136-7)1 The been British regarded writer as eclectic, Mervyn noncanonical Peake's Titus fantasies; books have it is hard long been regarded as eclectic, noncanonical fantasies; it is hard to find them on the shelves of bookstores, and they appear to be a minority taste. Part of this is due to their straddling of many modes - fantasy, bildungsroman, postmodernist novel, Gothic novel. Nowhere is their richness clearer than in Peake's treat- ment of his central theme - one crucial to him as artist and writer - that of the relativity of perception. Peake himself had personally experienced its relativity; he was born in China in 1911, into the family of a missionary doc- tor, and, for the first eleven years of his life witnessed the jux- taposition of the ordered life of the missionary compound and the teeming, alien world outside it. Then he went to Britain, l I am indebted to the Mythopoeic Society of America, at whose eighteenth convention I gave a version of this paper, for permission to publish it here.

Vol. 1, No. 2 13</page><page sequence="2">14 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS with the experience of a world most others had not known in his mind and memories, and lived there for the rest of his life. It is possible to see the story of Titus, the young Earl of Gormen- ghast Castle, whose birth, accession to the Earldom and growth in the ritual-centered Castle environment he chronicles in loving detail (including the young man's later rejection of that nurturing but personally crushing environment and travels to a world closer to our own post-World War II one), as a transmu- tation of Peake's own life-pattern. On the one hand, Peake is a "straight" fantasist. His creation of the world of Gormenghast is a search for the true equivalents to the perceptions of "one's own world in a style germane to its substance . . . with its native forms and denizens that never were before, yet have their roots in one's experience" (Draw- ings, p. 11). On the other, he is a novelist in the tradition of Dick- ens, using characters as embodiments of his theme of perception's relativity, describing the animate in inanimate terms and vice-versa. Here, for example, is the description of Mr. Flay, the ruling Earl's valet: His black suit, patched on the elbows and near the collar with a greasy sepia-colored cloth, fitted him badly but belonged to him as inevitably as the head of a tortoise emerging from its shell or the vulture's from a rubble of feathers belong to that reptile or that bird. His head, parchment-colored and bony, was indigenous to that greasy fabric. It stuck out from the top window of its high black building as though it had known no other residence (pp. 39-40). The reader's mind is made to move back and forth between the animal, the human, and the inanimate, stimulated to cocreate the images as Peake hurtles from the animate to the architec- tural artifact. He piles conceit on conceit, in a fashion both ver- bally and imagistically associative (and, at the same time, cerebrally controlled), and stretches the reader's concept of the character being described. The process of reading Peake is that of looking in the directions in which he guides the reader, and making the vital mental connections in such a way as to be ex- posed to his perceptions while bringing in one's own. As Rosa González puts it, "Peake expects the reader to actively engage his/her imagination through direct visualization and the sug-</page><page sequence="3">MERVYN PEAKE: THE RELATIVITY OF PERCEPTION 15 gestion of aspects of character in symbolic form, and the asso- ciative cluster of images to derive particular characteristics."2 To act as a guide to the reader, while at the same time em- phasizing the relativity of perception, appears to be paradoxi- cal. Peake manages it by at once allowing the reader to add the dimension of comprehension to what he is describing and leav- ing "the spectator no option but to see what you liked; the curves, or the jagged nesses; the outline shape, or the shadowy patterns, the sense of movement or stillness, the contrastings of flatness with solidity, dark with light, smooth with rough - whatever it may have been . . . your choice; give him none" (Writings &amp; Drawings , p. 55). Envisage, for example, the follow- ing description of Barquentine, the Castle's Master of Ritual, metamorphic even to the point of destroying the boundary be- tween self and other: Something of the wasp, and something of the scraggy bird of prey there was about this Barquentine. There was something of the gale-twisted thorn tree also, and something of the gnome in his blistered face. The eyes, horribly liquid, shot their malice through veils of water. They seemed to be brimming ... as though old, cracked, sandy saucers were filled so full of topaz- colored tea as to be swollen at their centers . . . the crutch, an- cient, filthy and hard as iron, was the man himself. ... It grew from him like a diseased the nerveless limb - an extra limb . . . more eloquent of spleen than any word, than any language ( Gor - menghast, p. 159). Do we not surrender the mind to the rhythm of the words as well as to the extra-verbal clues, the shape-shifting wordpaint- ing (not to mention the visual impact of the crutch on the mind's eye, so reminiscent of Dickens)? Here we are in the omniscient narrator's confidence, a privileged position; sometimes we are inside the brains of particular characters in any given scene, sometimes watching them omnisciently. The metamorphic fluid- ity of Peake's descriptions, as evinced above, the blending of the familiar and the strange often purely through the effects of con- junction, and the powerfully visual quality of Peake's writing expand the confines of the created worlds of Gormenghast and 2 I am indebted to Professor Maria Cerezo for her translation of González' dissertation abstract; this excerpt comes from Chapter Three.</page><page sequence="4">16 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS Titus Alone, creating a particular kind of fantasy firmly rooted in the primary world (to use Tolkien's phrase). But perception in the novels is not just confined to vivid paint- erly writing, although that, to my mind, is one thing that makes Peake a richly rewarding author to read; it is tripartite in its rel- ativity - of self (including the potential for self-delusion), of others (those who form the communities in which Titus, the young Earl, finds himself), and of the world around the character. Peake uses characters in various ways to convey this, the most developed of whom are Titus and Steerpike, his upstart rival. Let us look briefly at examples of each kind of perception. In the chapter "Near and Far" in Titus Groan, describing Steerpike 's climb over the roofscapes of Gormenghast after his escape from incarceration at the hands of Flay, the very sequence is significant. Steerpike, "straining his eyes, could make out an irregularity and presumed that there must have been a window" (p. 138); he pushes himself to see the details and then makes the mental leap necessary to construct the scene. As readers, we are sometimes hard-pressed to keep up, particularly when the perspective, though centered here in Steerpike, switches to extreme objectification. This is the Castle Poet as seen by Steerpike from his vantage point. It was a long head. It was a wedge, a sliver, a grotesque slice in which it seemed the features had been forced to stake their claims, and it appeared that they had done so in a great hurry and with no attempt to form any kind of symmetrical pattern for their mutual advan- tage. The nose had evidently been the first upon the scene and had spread itself down the entire length of the wedge, beginning among the grey stubble of the hair and ending among the grey stubble of the beard, and spreading on both sides with a ruthless disregard for the eyes and mouth which found precarious pur- chase. The mouth was forced by the lie of the terrain left to it, to slant at an angle which gave to its right-hand side an expression of grim amusement and to its left, which dipped downwards across the chin, a remorseless twist. It was forced by not only the unfriendly monopoly of the nose, but also by the tapering character of the head to be a short mouth; but it was obvious by its very nature, that under normal conditions it would have covered twice the area. The eyes in whose expression might be read the unending grudge they bore against the nose were as</page><page sequence="5">MERVYN PEAKE: THE RELATIVITY OF PERCEPTION 1 7 small as marbles and peered out between the grey grass of the hair. This head, set at a long incline upon a neck as wry as a turtle's, cut across the narrow vertical black strip of the window (p. 139). We are being guided with a judicious mixture of the piling on of visual images, details and scale, and humorous conjecture as to how the face has become the way it is; thus we see the head as Steerpike sees it - first the overall picture and then a gradual accumulation of details and presumptions (or should one say re- construction?!). By Titus Alone, Peake is using a kind of cartoonist's short- hand. Here is the description of the people at the upper-class Cusp-Canines' party at which Titus is for a time an uninvited guest, an unseen eye: . . . even from the first glimpse, it appeared as much like a gathering of creatures, of birds and beasts and flowers, as a gathering of humans. They were all there. The giraffe-men and the hippopotamus-men. The serpent-ladies and the heron-ladies. The aspens and the oaks: the thistles and the ferns - the beetles and the moths - the crocodiles and the parrots: the tigers and the lambs: vultures with pearls around their necks and bison in tails. But this was only for a flash, for as Titus, drawing a deep breath, stared again, the distortions, the extremes, appeared to crumble, to slip away from the surge of heads below him, and he was again among his own species (p.38). This satirical vision is only temporary, but it serve as a start- lingly zoomorphic interlude that is at once depersonalizing and detailed. The reversals of perspective in the examples quoted are part of Peake's invitation to explore. Nothing is quite what it seems, depending on the angle of mind or eye, and the element of sur- prise is always a possibility, even if it is predominantly mediated through the often obvious third-person narrator. The self is the reference point when contemplating the other and the outside world. Sometimes Peake allows a more direct access to the characters' perceptions of the world. This is particularly evident in the fluid ego-boundaries of the young Titus, who, when ex- ploring the outer reaches of the castle, becomes afraid of losing</page><page sequence="6">18 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS his identity to it: "... a sense of terror jerked him to his feet again. It seemed that he had begun to be absorbed into the stone. He must be on his feet. He must keep moving. ... He began to whisper the words ["I have lost my way"] so that he would hear them, but not the castle" ( Gormenghast , p. 181). This fear of be- coming the Castle as opposed to being its symbol adds to the reader's awareness of Titus' growing sense of his personal in- dividuality in contrast to his dynastic role. When he is out in the forest, he sees the trees as anthropomorphic personifications, and later he describes them in terms of the architecture of Gor- menghast, his personal reference point: "What brooded within those high and leafy walls? Those green and sunny walls? What of the inner shadows? What of the acorn'd terraces, and the hol- low aisles of leaves?" ( Gormenghast , p. 103). One of the most associative and powerful mappings of the growing perceptions of the young child about his world in Peake's writing is in Chapter 14 of Gormenghast; unfortunately the passage is too long to quote here. But it traces the growing significance of objects as stimuli to the imagination, and the variety of ways in which objects can be viewed, turning into a vivid, quasihypnotic meditation on color. In a related example of the relativity of perception in Titus Groan, Peake shows Steerpike exploring Titus' sister Fuschia's private attic. It is after he has climbed the roofscapes, and he is exhausted. He sees a book illustration. ... it was to Steerpike in his unusual physical state as though that picture were the world, and that he, in some shadowy adja- cent province, were glimpsing the reality. He was the ghost, the purple-and-grey page was truth and actual fact. Below him stood three men . . . their eyes gazed out beyond the page and beyond the reach of Steerpike, and on and on beyond the hill of Gormenghast and the Twisted Woods . . . Equally real to the boy at that moment were the grey-black simple letters that made up the words and the meaning of the verses on the opposite side of the page. The uncompromising visual starkness of all that lay on the table had for a moment caused him to forget his hunger, and although uninterested in poetiy or pictures, Steerpike, in spite of himself, read with a curiously slow and deliberate concentration. . . . Everything was</page><page sequence="7">MERVYN PEAKE: THE RELATIVITY OF PERCEPTION 19 equally important because all had become so real now where all had been so blurred" (pp. 149-50). It is through a mixture of scale, angle, and extensive detail that Peake aids the mind's eye of the reader. Flawed though his use of the third person narrator is - in that in the omniscient and third person, narrative voices become virtually indistin- guishable - he gives his readers a sense of the world around and the people in that world. The dramatic effects of scale, texture, chiaroscuro, the play- ing in Sternean fashion with time sequence, in Dickensian man- ner with animate and inanimate, have all been noted elsewhere, and they are perhaps the most easily apprehensible of Peake's devices to highlight his central theme.3 But one element that is not often looked at is the relativity of self-perception in these novels - and Peake does not shirk it in his examination of the issues of identity and maturity through the characters of Steer- pike and Titus. Titus and Steerpike are both opposites and twins. Where Steerpike sees himself as cerebral in all that he does, with his love reserved for well-made articles, not people, Titus is the moody young child, uncaring of the consequences of his actions, impulsive, emotional, and eager to break the Castle taboos. They both rebel against the weight of tradition and dynasty that shapes the actions of the Castle community - Steerpike as an angry young rebel with no hierarchical leverage except what he can achieve by making himself over as people in the Castle wish to see him, and Titus as the rightful dynastic heir oppressed by the weight of tradition and afraid of the total submersion of his private identity in his public role. Linked by their rebellion, they express it in different ways: Steerpike becomes the arch-symbol of authority after an arduous climb up the social ladder, using Fuschia, the Castle Doctor, and then the position of Master of Ritual to gain prestige and power; Titus becomes the fractious, rebellious child, driven by dreams of anonymity and regulation- less freedom. 3 See Batchelor, Manlove, Little, and Favier for critical and biographical details. 4 One provocative exception is Bruce Hunt's fine article.</page><page sequence="8">20 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS This changes as the novels progress, and the two are drawn into inexorable conflict - over Steerpike's pursuit of Titus' sis- ter. Titus' rebellion is against the ritual Steerpike represents, and the nefarious methods Steerpike uses, such as murder, to consolidate his power - something Titus senses. Their final con- flict is inevitable in terms of the patterning of the novels, and can be seen archetypally as well as individually; in fact, Steer- pike the cerebral lives out the archetypal, while Titus tries to become his own self-made person. Initially Steerpike takes great care to cover his tracks, behave obsequiously where necessary, and lay complex plots (such as burning the library, by which he hopes to establish himself firmly as rescuer and hero in the minds of the Castle commu- nity as well as destroying one of the main props of the sanity of Titus' father, the Earl). He becomes more careless, however, as time goes on. Having learned many of the secrets of the Castle ritual from Barquentine the old Master of Ritual, he tries to murder the latter in sadistic fashion, and the attempt literally backfires. Barquentine, acting in his capacity as a living embodi- ment of the Castle, sets Steerpike ablaze too, and, though dying, nearly costs the traitor his life. Finally Steerpike is witnessed at the scene of his murder of Titus' aunts; at that time he loses his mental clarity, under great stress since his near-death, and becomes subsumed into something more arche typal: . . . Steerpike was by no means mad in any accepted sense for every now and then he would repeat a number of high stepping paces as though to perfect them. It was as though he were identi- fying himself with some archetypal warrior, or fiend. A fiend, which although it had no sense of humor, had a ghastly gaiety - a kind of lethal lightness that struck at the veiy heart of the hu- manities . . . He was in the posture of some earthish dancer, but he soon tired of this strange display.. He had given himself up to it for those few moments, in the way that an artist can be the ig- norant agent of something far greater and deeper than his con- scious mind could even understand ( Gormenghast , pp. 381-2). This is the character who has hitherto been an exact imitator. After he realizes that he has an audience: His future was ruptured. His years of self-advancement and in- tricate planning were as though they had never been. A red cloud filled his head. His body shuddered with a kind of lust ... for an</page><page sequence="9">MERVYN PEAKE: THE RELATIVITY OF PERCEPTION 21 unbridled evil. Alone, loveless, vital, diabolic - a creature for whom compromise was no longer necessary, and intrigue was a dead letter. If it was no longer possible for him to wear, one day, the legitimate crown of Gormenghast, there was still the dark and terrible domain - the subterranean labyrinth (pp. 385-6). He becomes literally a demon figure, with his burned face, and his mind altered: He lived now among the abstractions. Something had altered. It was his mind. His brain was the same, but his mind was differ- ent. He was no longer a criminal because he chose to be. He had no longer the choice. His mind was engaged in a warfare of the gods. His mind paced outwards over no-man's-land, over the fields of the slain, paced to the rhythm of the blood's red bugles. To be alone and evil! To be a god at bay. What was more abso- lute? (p. 444). Finally, as he and Titus are fighting on the roof in the flooded ivy, his depersonalization is complete - "a thing with eyes like beads of blood, and forehead like a ball of lard - a thing whose mouth, thin as a thread, was opening [to] the high-pitched over- weening cry of a fighting cock ... he had swung full circle" (p. 498). He is killed, as he loses the only moment he has to kill Titus. In his book, In The Circles of Fear and Desire , Patrick Day de- scribes the protagonists of Gothic fantasy thus: . . . the male protagonists of the Gothic fantasy transform the heroic romance archetype and the Faustian tragic hero into an essentially pathetic character, self-blinded, duplicitous, a mon- strous parody of the identity he attempts to assert, which is re- ally no identity at all (p. 102). Both Titus and Steerpike are on a downward spiral towards a loss of identity; in trying to find themselves they lose them- selves, Steerpike completely, and Titus partially. Titus, for his part, fulfills his dynastic obligations grudgingly from the beginning, as Peake would have us believe. Peake shows him alternately furious at his lack of anonymity, despite the attempt to school him with ordinary boys, and brooding on his domain. His love-hate is developed early, and when, escap- ing from yet another ritual, he catches a glimpse of his bastard foster sister, the Thing, an embodiment of his vision of freedom</page><page sequence="10">22 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS to whom he becomes completely enthralled in an adolescent fashion, he starts to ponder a means of escape - "If he should leave the Castle! ... He was unable to hazard a guess as to what such a thought implied ..." ( Gormenghast , pp. 401-2). Part of this is in direct reaction to this involvement in the hunt for Steerpike and his witnessing of "an underworld of which he had had no conception" (p. 382). But part of it stems from the stimulus of the Thing and her flouting of the rules. He witnesses her death, is told of that of his sister Fuschia, and, with these links to the Castle broken, determines to kill Steer- pike for his blighting effect on both Fuschia and himself - not because it is his dynastic duty. His mother is aware of his emotional treachery to the dynasty, but, try as she might to pre- vent him from fulfilling his personal aim, she cannot: "... he was no one's figurehead. He was only himself. Someone who might have been a fish of the water, a star, or a leaf or a stone ... a heart in abody that swam through space and time" (p. 487). Although his action is interpreted as would be expected by the Castle community (Earl as Savior-figure), he himself is a self- deluded romantic, craving a different environment and adven- ture, and imagining that he is mentally and emotionally free of Gormenghast: Out of nowhere, and suddenly, the uprush of his rebellion. . . . [He was] a traitor if they like, but a man who had torn away the brambles from his clothes, the ivy from his limbs, the bindweed from his brain ... he was sure that he was free (p. 467). He leaves on his quest for new worlds, convinced that he can do without the Castle. What he does not realize is that his whole perception of him- self is bound up in the Castle; his lordly manners do not receive an appreciative reception in the futuristic world of Titus Alone, where he is seen as mad, diagnosed as having delusions of gran- deur - displaced and virtually a beggar. He is nostalgic, compar- ing things in the new world to the one he has left, consumed by his own inner vision and doubting his sense of his own identity, both public and private, fiercely. The more it is questioned, the more he doubts it, consumed with guilt for his abdication as Earl and yet filled with a sense of adventure even in his terrible dis- placement:</page><page sequence="11">MERVYN PEAKE: THE RELATIVITY OF PERCEPTION 23 Behind him, whenever he stood, or slept, were the legions of Gor- menghast . . . tier upon cloudy tier, with the owls calling through the rain, and the ringing of the rust-red bells ( Titus Alone, p. 189). The romantic in him cannot shake off Gormenghast, no matter how hard he tries, and he needs to synthesize the different facets of his sense of himself and move on. This happens in extremis, after he has unwittingly divulged his Gormenghast self in delirium to Cheeta, daughter of a scien- tist who runs a death factory. She is looking for difference in her life, as he is, and is interested in him for this reason. When he refuses her, Cheeta, in her way as autocratic as he, arranges for a vast parody of Gormenghast in a distant location with the in- tent of driving him insane. She demonically mimics the commu- nity he has revealed to her to the extent that his capacity to distinguish between fact and fantasy is seriously impaired: Knowing that all this was a kind of a cruel charade did not seem to help, for in the inmost haunts of the imagination he felt the impact (p. 237). He needs a situation this strenuous to fight free of his roman- tic notions about himself and Gormenghast, in part through the arrival on the scene and resultant death of his mentor and father-figure, Muzzlehatch, who has always believed in his san- ity and the reality of Gormenghast's existence. Titus is finally able to perceive Gormenghast as "all he had lost; all he had searched for. The concrete FACT of it. The proof of his own san- ity and love" (p. 262). It is at this later point, physically on the outskirts of the Castle, that he realizes that he has internalized it and with it his sense of himself as a person in his own right. Thus it is that he can leave again - "All that he sought was jos- tling within himself. He had grown up" (p. 263.). So for Titus there is synthesis, as his perceptions have come full circle, his illusions have been stripped away, and he can make a clear-sighted choice. But for the reader the questions can only remain. Is this ending a denial of all that has gone before, as Colin Manlove argues? How do we see Titus now? Has Peake conveyed Titus' growth convincingly? What of the picture of the world portrayed in Titus Alone ? Are Peake's perceptions of our age too judgmental, with his focus on high technology used for</page><page sequence="12">24 JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS predominantly evil purposes, his echoes of the Holocaust, and his answer in Titus' choice that neither the nostalgic past nor the frightening future is the answer? In keeping with his co-creative emphasis throughout, he places the responsibility for tackling these issues firmly on the reader's shoulders. As he puts it when writing of Gormenghast Castle ( Gormenghast , p. 263), "the colors were devilish or an- gelical according the color of the mind that watched them." Per- ception is, after all, relative to the one doing the perceiving. REFERENCES Batchelor, John. Mervyn Peake : A Biographical and Critical Study. London: Duckworth, 1974. Day, William Patrick.
