The author begins by a critique of the traditional teleology ac- cording to which the universe is the product of a consciously pur- posive Mind. In sucessive chapters of Part I he argues that such beliefs arose as primitive anthropomorphisms and can not be de-</page><page sequence="2">242 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fended in terms of pre-determination, nor of the view that the uni- verse is an organism, nor of hylozoism. They are untenable because the inorganic and the organic are too much opposed to one another, because there is too much needless variety of organic forms, too much "chance in human affairs, " too many "follies in history, " and too much illusion in our so-called knowledge. Moreover, the course of evolution, instead of strengthening the argument for a purposive Mind, weakens it by showing so many delays, makeshifts, and blun- ders along the way. What is needed, according to Mr. Noble (pp. 140-155), is an emancipation from anthropomorphism and psychism, and an inter- pretation of nature in accordance with the three principles of the "relational method"-(1) likeness, which I might paraphrase as "detection of essential analogies"; (2) derivation, or search for fundamental or universal characters; and (3) universality, or inter- related explanations. Employing these principles in Part II Mr. Noble finds throughout the cosmos the workings of a power system, with everywhere a progressive subordination of unit to system, so that entities are fundamentally not self-sourced, or absolute, but system-sourced, or systemically related. With a profusion of ex- amples drawn from inorganic, organic, social, esthetic, and even (p. 483) epistemological processes, it is argued that there is an ever recur- ring tendency, ultimately traceable to the power system, to reduce differential stress to equalized stress (p. 189). This reduction is a mark of self-maintenance, which is the primordial function of the cosmos as accessible to us (p. 203). The cosmic self-maintenance sets up enduring forms which "mimic conscious design" (p. 211), and which, since they are enduring, symmetrical, harmonious (p. 215) and economical of energy or effort (pp. 389 if.), are teleological. They all give evidence of an intelligence which has no necessary con- nection with consciousness, or even with organisms, but which is rooted in the very nature of power, and is to be regarded as pur- posive (p. 155). In Part III this general view is applied to problems of biology. Holding that ways to an end need not be distinguished here from means to an end (cf. p. 345), Mr. Noble replies to mechanism with the statement that the organism, with pre-conscious purposiveness, is the real artificer of the organs (p. 349). Heredity is said to re- sult from a time-and-space order imposed by a system upon indi- viduals (p. 372 f.). Natural selection, even if it accounts for the survival of the fittest, does not account for the production of the fittest (p. 423). Part IV deals with problems of epistemology, which on the whole are subordinated to those of metaphysics. Causal successions go in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 243 classes for minds because causal action goes in classes for nature (p. 459). Knowledge mirrors only those features of power which are illumined for it by organic end (p. 468), but nevertheless it is correspondence with reality which enables ideas to work (p. 473). The indispensable precondition of freedom is the definiteness which power must have if it is to be power at all (p. 487). A few suggestions in the general field of philosophy of religion are included in Part V, where the attempt is made (pp. 541 ff.) to show that the chief ideas of science and religion are fundamentally alike, since both have been concerned with the infinite, the unknow- able, immanence, and monistic explanations, and both have mani- fested humility toward the universe. Regarding the problem of an impersonal object of religious worship, the author notes that for any individual the vast yield of the historic past and even of the present human social order is predominantly not personal but impersonal (p. 535). The book gives evidence of amazingly wide reading and varied human interests. The style is unusually vivid and fluent, although it must be added at once that a good many light words and altogether too many antiquated quotations are swept along in the current. The critique of traditional views is in some respects remarkable; it is doubtful if even Von Hartmann in all his gloom ever thought to criticize the universe because of the isthmus of Panama (p. 93), or the human trunk with its complement of arms and legs (p. 107 f.). But Mr. Noble fails, I think, to allow sufficiently for the fact that in general such strictures upon the nature of things are old problems for the theologians, and can be met by more than one theistic doctrine. I welcome particularly the repeated statements (e.g., pp. 134, 214, 326, 520, and chapters 36 and 38) that various structures and processes throughout the cosmos exhibit significant resemblances; the well-taken point that science can not hope to elucidate the or- ganism from the organism alone, but must think of it in cosmic terms (p. 132); and the admirable insistence that "anthropomorphism apart, we are rationally entitled to find in the universe the funda- mental characters of our own being " (p. 326). When it comes to a question of the book's general constructive contribution, I think it must be said to suffer from three serious de- fects. In the first place, Mr. Noble's theories about the ether and power units, while probably not entirely vitiated by the theory of relativity, at any rate need translation into the language of that theory before they can command any scientific notice worth men- tioning. Secondly, I think there are grave questions raised by what I would call his undiscriminating use of the word "purposive. " To</page><page sequence="4">244 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY be sure, no one has any copyright on this word nor, unfortunately, on any other; but when a writer who is so anxious to avoid anthro- pomorphism and the personalistic views has called the economical self-maintenance of the cosmic entities teleological, that ought to be enough. I can not see that Mr. Noble adds anything by calling them also purposive, except the unavoidable suggestion of courting the views which he has repudiated. L. J. Henderson, whose important works in this field Mr. Noble does not mention, makes just the kind of distinction ' which is here lacking. Dewey's distinction between natural ends and ends-in-view,2 or, in extremity, J. Arthur Thom- son's distinction between purposiveness and purposefulness,$ would help clear up the confusion which is likely to beset readers who look to Mr. Noble for guidance in what the jacket of the book describes as "the disputed no-man 's-land between science and religion." Another misleading use of a word is that of "subjectivism" in chapter 49, where "psychomorphism" or "animism"x would be clearer. Finally, it may be questioned whether this long treatise, while meaning to keep a straight course, does not end by traversing its own starting-point in the opposite direction. If the universe viewed as a contrivance is as poor a job as Mr. Noble with incisive rhetoric de- clares, in Part I, how does it become so worthy of our confidence when viewed later as a self-maintaining system of distributed stresses? We still have the isthmus of Panama, and the same old arms and legs. Surely arguments from the limitations of our knowl- edge, which are urged against the traditional views in chapter 12 and on the side of Mr. Noble's view in chapter 43, are common property, and can be used by any one in support of anything.
