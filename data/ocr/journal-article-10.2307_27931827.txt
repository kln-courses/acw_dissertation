<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Decorated Chalice from Tell eh'Or?meIKinneret By Gabriele Fa?beck Dedicated to the memory of Prof Dr. Volkmar Fritz In the summer of 1999, during the 10 th season of excavations directed by Volkmar Fritz at Tell el-'Or?me/Kinneret (200791.252859 Palestine Grid) a decorated clay chalice (find no. 9595/1) was uncovered (cf. fig. 1; Taf. I)1. Tell el-cOr?me, settled from the Chalcolithic through the Ottoman periods, witnessed its greatest extension in the Early Iron Age when a large city developed on the natural hill. In the 1 lth/early 10th century "[t]he city became one of the most important regional centers of northern Palestine, possibly replacing Hazor, the dominating site of the area in the Bronze Ages, in this function" (Pakkala/M?NGER/Zan GENBERG 2004, 17). Recent excavations unearthed significant parts of the domestic quarters of that city2. The remarkably well-preserved dwelling units were built down the natural hill slope and extend all the way down to the shore of the lake (cf. fig. 2). They form the immediate find context for the vessel under consideration here. Fig. 1. Petalled chalice (find no. 9595/1), late 11th century b.c.e., from Area R, L. 6143 (drawing: Marina Zeltser, Jerusalem). 1 A preliminary discussion of this vessel can be found in FASSBECK/M?NGER/R?HL 2003, 47-49. 2 The excavations are now being continued by the Kinneret Regional Project in cooperation of the universities of Helsinki, Mainz, and Bern.

The Archaeological Context of the Find The chalice was found shattered in L. 6143 in Area R and could not fully be retrieved; parts of the foot, bowl and the ornamentation are missing. L. 6143 is part of what the excavators consider to be a dwelling unit of local Stratum 1 which corresponds to Kinneret Stratum V. This stratum, following the traditional chronology, has been dated to the late 11th century b.c.e.3. The dwelling unit under consideration consists of six rooms complete with a court yard (fig. 3; Taf. 2) and thus conforms to the well-known courtyard type4. The unit is built along the tell's slope and has three terraces: the lowest of the building's three levels com prises two rooms, the middle terrace one room with the courtyard, while the highest level has three rooms, of which the one to the extreme east has not been excavated completely. L. 6143 denotes the middle room of the uppermost level, measuring 2.00 x 2.25 m. The walls conform with the typical technique of a stone fundament and mud brick superstructure. L. 6143 was particularly rich in pottery, yielding large sherds of four Iron Age I cooking pots, a storage jar, and a pilgrim flask decorated with concentric circles. The vessels had obviously been pressed against the southern wall at some point and were found in destruction debris on the room's floor. Only one of these vessels was restorable in its entirety. The chalice was the sole object found in the middle of the room, shattered and incomplete like the other vessels. Immediately to the east of this heap of smashed vessels, in the south eastern corner of the room, an installation was unearthed consisting of three large basalt stones, each about 30 cm high, with smoothed surfaces and set in a triangle 5. At the bottom of these stones ash inclusions could be discerned and this level accords well with the find level of the pottery. 2. The Appearance of the Chalice The chalice is unique among the finds from the Iron Age city of Kinneret in regard to its size, shape, and decoration. It was wheel-made in one piece. The color of the clay is yellowish (10 YR 7/6) with many black and few white grits. The same color categorization applies to the core, which was fired at a medium to high temperature. The vessel measures 23 cm in height and the foot's diameter is 10.5cm. The bowl with its flaring rim is shallow and small in relation to the foot, with a height of only 6 cm and a diameter of 18 cm. The foot is hollow and conical, tapering towards the top. Its slender shape gives the chalice a somewhat elegant appearance. This feature stands in marked contrast to the rather squat shape of the common Iron Age chalice which is dominated by a comparatively large bowl on a short foot (amiran 1969, pi. 68). All other examples of chalices found in Kinneret match the common types of Early Iron Age chalices (Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004, 19 fig. 9 ). Immediately underneath the bowl, the upper part of the foot is decorated with a plastic application of 3 Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004, 19. For an alternative dating see m?nger 2003. 4 Only one of many examples of Early Iron Age Kinneret, cf. Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004, 17. 5 While the possible function of the basalt stone installation still presents an enigma, one might compare a find from Lapp's excavations at Taanach (Lapp 1964, 37). Lapp reports on the find of four stone drums from his cultic structure: "Also associated with the burned debris in Room 1 were four stone drums [...]. They were entirely rough-hewn, and their ends were slightly convex. There are no smooth spots to indicate that they were used for grinding, and it is tempting to suggest a cultic usage although there seems to be no parallel". ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="5">A Decorated Chalice from Tell el-'Oreme I Y?nnevei 19 leaves which are arranged as a garland. Except for one leaf which broke in antiquity, the garland is complete with six of the original seven rather erect standing leaves. This motif is repeated around the upper part of the bowl. Here the clay petals are significantly bigger and heavier; thus making the bowl appear larger than it actually is. The bowl along with its applications was badly broken but most of the sherds were retrieved, only one of the upper register's petals is missing, making an original total of thirteen leaves. The chalice was originally decorated with a slip and paint, remains of which are clearly visible. The whole vessel was covered with a thick cream-colored slip which was also applied to the inside of the bowl; however, only a few traces of the slip, and even less of its original color, are discernible here. Instead, blackened spots of slip and other black discoloring found only on the inside suggest that substances were burned in the chalice. The slip is extraordi narily thick on the upper register of leaves but less thick and less well preserved on the rest of the vessel. Some additional painting was applied on the slip of which only very little has survived. What is clear from the sparse remains is a double line of thin concentric circles executed in black color both around the underside of the upper register of petals (thus located out of sight) and around the lower part of the foot just above the base. There may have been more of the same circular decoration between the rim and the base of the upper leaf garland but this is hard to establish in its state of preservation. From what remains of the painting no other colors or patterns can be perceived. Judging from the remnants, the vessel documents a rather modest choice out of the artistic palette available to Early Iron Age potters6. 3. Function of the Chalice and Evidence for a House Cult in the Iron Age I City The chalice's most outstanding feature is its petal d?cor. Together with the evidence of burning on the inside of the bowl this raises the question of the chalice's function. The most likely explanation seems to be its assignment to cultic purposes for the burning of substances, hence it falls into the group of vessels which are commonly classified as "incense burners"7. Such classification may be considered difficult since the archaeological context in which the chalice was uncovered is not cultic per se but clearly domestic. On the other hand, this does not rule out the possibility that the vessel was indeed used for cultic purposes, albeit within a domestic cult for which evidence exists from Iron Age sites in Israel and Jordan (Negbi 1993; van der Toorn 1996, 245-246; Daviau 2001; Nakhai 2001, 161-200 passim). The chal ice under consideration here is not the sole object found in Early Iron Age Kinneret that attests to cultic activities in a domestic context8. 6 For a brief overview of the types of painted decorations common in that time period cf. Mazar 1980, 95. In general, Mazar notes that "[d]uring the Iron Age I, painted decoration became very com mon". 7 Granted, this classification is often of little value since many of the vessels thus grouped together do not display any traces of the burning of substances. As has been suggested in the literature, similarly shaped vessels may have been used in cultic contexts for a variety of purposes, cf. the discussion in Mazar 1980, 95-96; principally critical of the categorization of such vessels as burners cf. Zwi ckel 1990, 153-154. 8 Fassbeck/M?nger/R?hl 2003; Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004, 22-23. ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="6">20 Gabriele Fa?beck 4. Comparable Objects from Other Sites The type of leaf decoration found on the Kinneret chalice is not confined to similar vessels allegedly used in cultic contexts. In fact, "[t]he leaf-capital is a common and popular motif decorating a wide variety of ancient artifacts, such as candelabra, thymiateria, and furniture as well as ornamenting architecture" (Hachlili 1985, 36). The distribution of the motif and the question of where it ultimately originates has already received some attention by scholars (Niemeyer/Schub art 1965, 78-81; Merhav 1980, 105; Stern 1980, 97-98; Hachlili 1985; Fritz 1992, 39-40; Franz 1998-99, 87-89; Singer-Avitz 2002, 139). This broader issue will not be of interest here. Instead, I intend to discuss some objects which allow for immediate comparison: clay and metal vessels, from the Iron Age I and II periods which were probably used for cultic purposes9. Apart from artistic depictions of such vessels with foliate d?cor10, a number of objects from excavations provide parallels for certain features of the Kinneret chalice. The following analysis presents specimen which will serve to establish the typological context of the vessel from Kinneret. 4. 1. Two-Part Stands with Bell-Shaped Pedestals and a Varying Number of Petal Garlands 11 The Chicago Oriental Institute's excavations at Megiddo unearthed a vessel (P 6056), which has been identified as an offering or incense stand12. The stand originates from the well preserved Stratum VI, which was terminated by a thorough destruction. The excavators dated this stratum to the Early Iron Age period (1200-1100) l\ but in a reassessment of the evi dence by Harrison (2004, 12) it has now been identified as a Late Iron Age I stratum (11th century)14. The stand was recovered, together with other cult vessels, from a context which the excavators characterized as "probably residential buildings" (loud 1948, 105),5. Fresh reconsiderations of the find context have drawn attention to the possibility that metal work shops were integrated in the domestic architecture and that the recovered cult objects might have been used in that settingI6. The stand has survived complete in two parts, the pedestal of 9 Related, if somewhat remotely and not discussed here, are candelabra from Phoenicia, Cyprus and Greece, dating to the 8th through 5 th centuries b.c.e. which Hachlili (1985) introduces in connection with a petalled candelabrum from the Hecht Museum of Haifa University. 10 Hachlili (1985) provides a short overview as does Franz 1998-99, 101-102; especially prominent vessels with foliate d?cor on the Lachish reliefs in the palace of Nineveh (ussishkin 1982, 84 85.107). 11 For a discussion more generally of conical cult stands cf. Mazar 1980, 93-96. 12 May 1935, pl. XX 6056; Loud 1948, pl. 145 no. 14; Harrison 2004, pl. 22. Some more bowls, respectively fragments thereof, with leaf decoration, have appeared in Megiddo (Lamon/Shipton 1939, pi. 38, unclassified no. 1 [assigned to Stratum V, 2nd half 11th century b.c.e.]; May 1935, pi. XIX 5803.4787; Loud 1948, pi. 80 no. 8; Finkelstein/Zimhoni/Kafri 2000, fig. 11.9 no. 8). Of those, the two listed by May are particularly noteworthy since they display remnants of painted decoration (concentric circles executed in light red [P 5803] and red, black and white [4787] respec tively) inside the bowl. For 5803 May (1935, pl. XIX) notes discoloring by fire on the inside and considers its use as a lamp. 13 Loud 1948, 5; May 1935, 2. 14 Defense of this date in response to Finkelstein's low chronology ibidem. lsCf. Mazar 1980, 94: "It is interesting to note that some of these stands [scilicet including the one discussed above] were found in Area C-C, at the southern part of the mound, which was a common dwelling area. This shows that the stands were used in house cults in addition to their use in the temple". ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="7">A Decorated Chalice from Tell el-'OremelKinneret 21 which is bell-shaped and fenestrated and thus parallels stands from other excavations 17. The vessel features two registers of leaf ornamentation, one surrounding the pedestal's upper part, the other decorating the bowl. Red lines decorate the leaves (May 1935, pl. XX). There is evidence of combustion inside the bowl but its nature is not conclusive l8, therefore the vessel's use as incense burner cannot be established with certainty. Two more examples come from an undisputed cultic context, namely from two temples at Beth-Shean which are part of the post-Egyptian Early Iron Age Stratum V of that site19. The two examples in question were part of a greater number of cultic stands, some cylindrical or bell-shaped, others in the form of multi-storied houses, all from the same context. Only the bell-shaped pedestals have been recovered from either stand, one stand is from the so-called northern temple, the other from the southern temple (rowe 1940, pl. XIV no. 1, pi. LVIII A no. 1-3, pl. XVI no. 1, pi. LX A no. 1-2; cf. Amiran 1969, 305.345). Both pedestals feature loop handles and are fenestrated with a number of snakes and birds applied in relief20. In addition, a register of protruding leaves is applied to both pedestals' uppermost parts (where the handles emerge from the vessels' bodies). Of the other similarly-shaped pedestals recov ered from the Stratum V temples, none possesses similar leaf decoration, it therefore follows that the leaves were not in any way integral to the function of this kind of cult vessel. The next example in this category originates from Tel c?m?l (Levy/Edelstein 1972, fig. 16 no. 6-7), a few kilometers west of Beth-Shean, and is dated to the early 10 th century b.c.e. (Stratum IV). It was discovered in an architectural context which the excavators interpret as being related to fabric production (levy/edelstein 1972, 332.338-339), although they consider the evidence for the room's function inconclusive. The vessel consists of a separate fenestrated pedestal and a bowl. The bowl is decorated with a pattern of circles executed in white paint and has four leaves of plastic application protruding from its underside and set across from each other. The leaves are decorated with vertical lines of white paint. The bell-shaped pedestal is embellished with a pattern of horizontal and vertical lines21. 16 Harrison 2004, 19-20: "Overall, the architectural remains in Area CC attest unambiguously to the domestic character of this part of the settlement. [.. .] Indeed, the wealth of pottery, metal (partic ularly bronze), and other material cultural remains recovered from the floors of the fragmentary buildings uncovered in Area CC is striking. These remains preserve a remarkable mix of ceramic traditions, evidence of cultic activity, as well as textile and (possibly) metal production". Cf. Nakhai 2001, 172-173. 17 See discussion below; cf. further DeVries 1975, 2-22; Mazar 1980, 93-96. 18 May 1935 comments on the photo of the stand pl. XX: "evidence of discoloration by fire in bowl, perhaps accidental". Paice 2004, 61 confirms the description but does not speculate as to the origin of the discoloration. 19 Second half 1 Ph/beginning 10th century b.c.e.: Mazar 1993, 221. 20 Snake-and-bird decoration is found on other stands from the same find context, too, cf. the brief discussion in Mazar 1980, 93. 21 As a related specimen which cuts across the classification of vessels with petal ornament proposed here, one may mention a one-part chalice-like vessel with a bell-shaped and fenestrated foot from the antiquities market (Amiran/Perrot 1972). The vessel features a circle of "conical knobs" (Ami ran /Perrot 1972, 56) which bear resemblance to the well attested leaf garlands on other vessels. Amiran and Perrot group the object with cult vessels from other sites dating to the Iron Age I period and mention black stains in the bowl which probably derive from the burning of substances (Amiran/Perrot 1972, 60). For this type of vessel (conical foot with attached bowl) cf. the dis cussion in Mazar 1980, 94. ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="8">22 Gabriele Fa?beck Another example with a double occurrence of the leaf application, is a find from Taanach (rast 1978, 36 fig. 54). In this case, both garlands are fixed to what appears to be the pedestal (no accompanying bowl is recorded). The vessel was recovered in a cistern (L. 69), which probably was part of a neighboring building, identified as a cultic structure (rast 1978, 23). The pottery assemblage found in the cistern is dated to Taanach Period IIB, /. e. the 10 th century b.c.e. The object, characterized as an offering stand by the excavators, is "cy lindrical with a smaller diameter toward the top" (rast 1978, 36). It is noteworthy for its double line of petal d?cor (the upper one of which is only rudimentarily preserved) along with two handles fixed to the lower part of the vessel (Rast 1978, 179). The stand is hollow and Rast presumes that the stand was originally used in combination with a bowl. He determines the use of these vessels with removable tops rather as libation vessels than incense burners (Rast 1978, 36). A final example from Lachish is a bowl (Reg. no. 564/1; aharoni 1975, pi. 4322 no. 1), discovered among an assemblage of cultic vessels in what the excavator Aharoni identified as a sanctuary room and assigned to Stratum V of the 10 th century (aharoni 1975, 12). The identification of the architectural remains as a room dating to Stratum V has recently been seriously challenged by ussishkin (2003) upon a reexamination of the plan and photographs which Aharoni provided. It now appears that the architectural features belong to various stratigraphie phases and that the cultic vessels were placed in a pit (not identified as such by the excavator) of Stratum IV (9th/early 8th century b.c.e. according to ussishkin 2003, 211), deposited after the sanctuary to which they belonged was abandoned. The bowl in question must have been associated with a pedestal ('stand' in Aharoni's nomenclature), but from the find context it is unclear as to which of the recovered 'stands' it belongs (aharoni 1975, 26 fig. 6). The Lachish bowl features a leaf ornament which in this case is attached to the underside of the bowl. The bowl's interior shows traces of burning and accordingly is clas sified as "incense-burner" by aharoni (1975, 26). Two of the stands from Lachish are fenestrated like the examples from Megiddo and display the same bulbous shape, however, they have no leaf d?cor. The specimens discussed in this paragraph, spaced out over the Iron Age I and Early Iron Age II periods, vary with regard to the number of leaf registers, and the registers' position on the vessels. No standard prototype is discernible; the exact execution of the leaf ornamenta tion seems to have been subject to the taste of the artist and therefore had no standardized symbolic denotation22. Two-part vessels with leaf decoration are archaeologically attested in strictly cultic as well as industrial and domestic architectural contexts, both of the latter are known to have served small-scale worship purposes. 4. 2. Two-Part Stands with Chalice-Like Shape The find of an 'incense burner' with leaf decoration is also recorded from Aharoni's ex cavations of the Iron Age II fortress in Arad (aharoni 1971, 36 fig. 52; singer-Avitz 2002, fig. 13.24). Until recently this example was poorly published, now herzog (2002) and Singer-Avitz (2002) in their interim report have provided some more detailed information. The originally red-slipped chalice-like cult vessel was discovered in the Israelite fortress's sanctuary, in an enclosure west of the sacrificial altar (herzog 1997, 175), "surrounded by "Comparable are the findings of Franz (1998-99, 84) with regard to metal thymiateria. ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="9">A Decorated Chalice from Tell el-c O reme /Kinneret 23 bones" (Herzog 2002, 58). Aharoni attributed the temple to Yahweh worship, the vessel would thus have been used within the Israelite Yahwistic cult23. Based on personal obser vation, the inside of the bowl shows several dark spots which might account for its classi fication as incense burner, however, nothing is recorded in the relevant literature24. The vessel was found alongside the Stratum X altar and has been dated with this phase of the altar, i.e., according to the revised stratigraphy of the fortress, mid 8th century B.C.E. (Herzog 2002, 14). Thus, the Arad specimen is significantly later than the chalice from Kinneret. The vessel was manufactured in two pieces with the bowl meant to be placed on top of the pedestal (HERZOG 2002, 58; SlNGER-AviTZ 2002, 138). The pedestal is decorated with two raised rings above its base and a garland of leaves surrounding the uppermost surviving portion. The bowl features as many as two registers of pendent leaves: one at its underside, the other with much smaller leaves forming its rim. Within this category, note should be made of an example from the middle fortress25 of Kadesh Barnea on the Sinai peninsula, assigned by the excavator to the 8 th/7 th century B.C.E. What appears to be a pedestal with a double leaf d?cor was published, one garland forming the top of the pedestal, the other surrounding its middle (COHEN 1983, 18 fig. 12). The pedestal displays a general resemblance to the Arad sanctuary chalice. No further information on the find context of this vessel has been pub lished 26, therefore it is impossible to infer anything about its original use or even determine whether this is indeed a pedestal that once would have held a bowl. Similar examples of two-part cult stands have recently been recovered in a hoard of cult vessels from an Edomite shrine of the late 7th/early 6th century B.C.E. Husb (CO HEN /ISRAEL 1996), one of these (depicted ibidem xi, upper right) displays a general resem blance to the Arad example. The excavators describe the d?cor accurately as "projecting triangles" (COHEN / ISRAEL 1996, 114), however, the similarity with the frequently encoun tered petal d?cor is striking. Husb has yielded a large variety of cult objects with trian gle/leaf d?cor including multiple part stands of anthropomorphic design and two-part stands with high, variously shaped pedestals. A last example to be included in this discussion was described by Sellin from his excavations at Taanach and not fully understood at the time. It may have been composed of two parts rather than one, although the evidence from the excavation report is somewhat ambiguous. The drawing published presents the vessel in what is an upside down position but was at the time considered the correct position, as the excavator explains: "Dasselbe [scilicet 23 For usage possibly in the context of the cult of Asherah see the discussion below (4.3.) on Ekron and Tell es-S?f?. 24 Despite this fact, both, Herzog (2002, 58) and Singer-Avitz (2002, 138) adopt Aharoni's ter minology and refer to the object as an incense burner. 25 Stratigraphy as established by Cohen and published in various places: Cohen 1981a; 1981b; 1983; 1985; the distinction between an "upper" and "middle" fortress has lately been challenged by Us sishkin 1995 who allows only for one fortress with four different settlement phases, extending from the 8lh (or beginning of the 7 th) century b.c.e. to its destruction in the first half of the 6th century b.c.e. 26 For his upper fortress Cohen (1980, 236) reports a remarkable yet enigmatic find constellation of a paved room with a round mud-brick installation which contained significant amounts of ashes. Animal bones and various pottery vessels, among them what Cohen terms an "incense-burner" were found in its vicinity. No depiction of this incense-burner is available and it could only be identical with the petal-decorated stand discussed above if this stand's assignment to the pottery assemblage of the middle fortress were by mistake.

In dieser waren drei Abzugs l?cher, so da? man sofort an ein R?ucherinstrument denken mu?te" (SELLIN 1904, 66 and fig. 81). The bowl ("Untersatz") is decorated with one register of drooping leaves at its underside, the pedestal is plain and undecorated except for small rectangular fenestrations ("Abzugs l?cher"). Vessels in this category, as far as their find context is recorded, are exclusively docu mented in architectural units devoted solely to cultic activities. However, since the examples are few and far between and the documentation incomplete, no further conclusions should be drawn from this observation. 4. 3. One-Part Stands with Chalice Shape Yadin's excavations at Hazor have unearthed from the upper city's Stratum XI a large vessel, which the excavators identified as an incense stand. Dated to the 11th century b.c.e., the one-part chalice-like stand measures between 45 and 60 cm27. Its foot is hollow and fenes trated, stylistically reminding more of two-part stands than of the chalice type under con sideration in this paragraph. It rests on a surprisingly small base which stands in marked contrast both to the vessel's height and to its broad bowl. The vessel's molded decoration, especially the row of projecting knobs immediately underneath the bowl's rim reminds of the petal type decoration, but it is very stylized and cannot confidently be classified as such. The archaeological context for the find is the small Israelite settlement on top of the ruins of the preceding Canaanite city, and, more immediately, a structure which the excavators interpreted as a cultic area on the basis of a unique ensemble of finds. This ensemble consisted of various pottery stands and a cache of bronze objects, including figurines (Ben-Tor [ed.] 1989, 81; cf. Yadin/Ben-Tor 1993, 602). The vessel from Hazor forms no particularly close parallel to the Kinneret specimen, but is interesting in that Hazor was a neighboring settlement and the stand derives from the same time period, /. e. 11th century b.c.e. Recent excavations at Rehov have unearthed the complete foot and a small fragment from the bowl of a petalled chalice (Mazar, personal communication 2005)28. The Rehov speci men is considerably taller than the find from Kinneret, originally measuring approximately 35 cm. It displays only one corolla of petals around the upper part of the foot underneath its joint with the bowl; the surviving bowl fragment is softly carinated with an everted rim and has no petal decoration. The vessel features elaborate painted decoration of geometric and floral design executed in red, white and yellow. The chalice was found in the destruction debris of Stratum V which the excavators associate with Shishak's campaign and thus date to the 10 th century b.c.e. The find context, as is the case in Kinneret, was a domestic building unit which yielded more evidence for cultic activity. Thus, the Rehov vessel provides an interesting parallel to our Kinneret chalice both with regard to its date and its find context. 27Yadin et al. 1961, pl. CCIV no. 1. The scales provided on pl. CCIV and pl. CCCXLV do not accurately match. Pl. CCIV offers the drawing of a 9cm high vessel along with a scale on which 1.5cm corresponds to 10cm in reality; pi. CCCXLV presents the photo of an also 9cm high vessel with the comment that it is depicted in an approximate 1:5 scale. 28 The following information has not yet been published and was generously shared with me by Prof. Amihai Mazar; Nava Panitz-Cohen provided me with all details.

Like the fragmented vessel from Rehov, the Tell es-S?fi chalice displays only one register of protruding leaves decorating the upper part of its foot. The chalice is of excellent workmanship and significantly taller than our example from Kinneret. However, like the find from Kinneret, the one from Tell es-S?ft is wheel-made and fashioned in one piece. Earlier scholarship attributed the vessel to the late 11th/early 10th centuries b.ce. (Stern 1980, 96; DeVries 1987, 31). If so, it would even provide a good chronological parallel. Unfortunately, nothing is published about the find context. However, in light of the finds from the recent excavations of Tell es-S?ft directed by Aren Maeir on behalf of Bar-Ilan University, one has to doubt this date. The excavations since 2001 have brought to light a number of decorated chalices and fragments thereof which are nearly identical with the one discussed here. All these finds are safely dated to Temporary Stratum 4, i.e. the late 9th/early 8th centuries b.ce. (Maeir 2003; Maeir/Shai 2006, 358). Like their counterparts from Kinneret and Rehov, the chalice from the Israel Museum as well as two new examples from Maeir's excavations which have been recovered completely, display a tall and elegant foot; the leaf garland is applied to the foot's upper part, still leaving some space before it widens to form the bowl. The shape of the bowl differs from the Kinneret chalice. In each case, the bowls are fashioned with relatively straight sides and are comparatively deep, but like their Kinneret counterpart they also end in a flaring rim. It is noteworthy that neither of the vessels from Tell es-S?ft, in difference to the find from Kin neret, shows traces of burning inside the bowl (maeir, personal communication 2005). In the case of the chalice from the Israel Museum, the bottom of the bowl was pierced during manufacture. Therefore, its function (and that of the other examples) most likely differed from that of the Kinneret chalice. Like the Kinneret chalice, the vessels from Tell es-S?ft were covered with a white slip on which additional painting was applied (Maeir /Shai 2006, 362). In the case of the chalice from the Israel Museum, the painted decoration consists of a few horizontal lines marking off the base from the foot of the vessel, again around the part of the foot over which the petals droop and, finally, between petal garland and bowl. The chalice displays a pattern of diagonal lines on the lower part of the foot and the bowl, as well as a pattern of triangles which decorate the vessel's foot. One of the newly found complete chalices displays an even more intricate combination of horizontal lines, lozenges, checkerboard patterns, triangles and more. The singularity of the artistic patterns within the Southern Levant has been noted by Maeir and Shai who suggest "that the painted decoration on the chalices derives from a defined stylistic domain (the Philistine Bichrome pottery with its Aegean origins), and was used on vessels with a clear functional and symbolic significance" (Maeir/Shai 2006, 363). Three more chalices from Tell es-S?ft, varying in height between 25 and 35 cm, display the applied, drooping petals. They now belong to the Dayan Collection and are attributed to the 10th/9th century b.ce. (Ornan 1986, 104-105). In the meantime they have been sup plemented by two new fragmentary finds from Temporary Stratum 4 of Maeir's excavations (Maeir/Shai 2006, 360), which help to correct these vessels' suggested dates as well. All three examples conform to the above-described typical carefully executed shape of the Tell es-S?ft petalled chalices, featuring straight-sided bowls with a flaring rim and a slender foot, 29 The vessel is now located in the Israel Museum (Reg. no. 63-447); cf.

However, one rather curious feature marks an exception. In this group of vessels the base is elaborated to form a fenestrated socle, which appears to imitate a tripod base. Tripod bases are rather untypical of clay works but are known from stone and metal vessels. This observation has prompted Ornan to suggest that the chalices were modeled after more expensive metal vessels (ornan 1986, 104). Maeir characterizes the find context of the chalices that came to light in his excavations as rather non-cultic but not domestic either (Maeir, personal communication 2005). At the present state of investigation the context appears to be that of storage or production areas, in some ways comparable to the finds of cultic implements in the Philistine city of Ekron to which we will now turn. The Ekron excavations produced 26 decorated chalices, six of them with petal decoration. Only the feet of these vessels with petal application have survived; no bowls were retrieved. This type of vessel seems to have been in use at Ekron for an extended time: one was from the 10th/9th century b.c.e. (Stratum III), one from the first half of the 8th century b.c.e. (Stratum IIB), three from the last third of the 7 th century b.c.e. (Stratum IB), and one was found in a secondary context, in a Bedouin burial (GlTlN, personal communication 2005). The three chalices with petal decoration from the 7 th century were found in the elite zone, Field IV (GlTlN 1993, 254); and those from the 10th/9 th, the first half of the 8 th centuries b.c.e., and from the Bedouin burial were found on the Northeast Acropolis, Field I (GlTlN, personal communication 2005). Cultic activity in the elite zone is amply attested by Temple Complex 650 and the buildings of the Temple Auxiliary Complex, complete with their cultic objects (most notably four-horned incense altars as well as decorated chalices) and dedicatory inscrip tions31. Cultic activity may also be attested in the industrial zone by finds of four-horned altars (GlTlN 2002, 113), and chalices with elaborate painted decoration (GlTlN 1993, 253). It is notable that none of the chalices comes from what traditionally has been defined as a cultic context, with one possible exception, that is, the chalice found alongside a number of cultic inscriptions in the elite zone (GlTlN, personal communication 2005). However, GlTlN (2002) argues that the presence of the four-horned altars in industrial and domestic contexts defines sacred spaces in their own right, either public or private in character. Chalices found along side those altars "played a role in the religious practice that was related to both industry and private worship" (GlTIN 1993, 254). The chalices with leaf decoration of which one unpainted fragment has so far been published (GlTlN 1993, 253 fig. 5b) were linked by GlTlN to the Asherah cult with its prominent tree symbolism, the tall foot representing a tree trunk to which the petals are applied to signify branches (GlTIN 1993, 254; Hestrin 1987, 220-223). Since inscriptional references to the goddess were found in the same archaeological contexts at Ekron, this conclusion seems warranted. Maeir and Shai concur with Gitin's interpretation for their group of chalices with petal d?cor. Unfortunately, the find context of the chalice at Kinneret does not provide any corroborating evidence which would allow the vessel to be assigned to a specific cult. 30 Only one of the fragments from Maeir's excavations displays a row of petal decoration, bowls have not been recovered (Maeir/Shai 2006, fig. 6:4-5, 7:6-7). 31 Including the Ekron royal dedicatory inscription, cf.

Recent excavations of the favissa from a Philistine temple at Yavn? have unearthed scores of cult stands among which petalled chalices are also repre sented. The analysis and publication of these abundant materials is underway 32. Finally, some stone specimens should briefly be mentioned in this category of one-part cult stands. A second cult stand from Tel ?m?l (Levy/Edelstein 1972, 339 pl. XXI no. 1; fig. 6.16/8), even though its general shape differs from the other vessels under review, does display some similarities. Like the vessel discussed earlier from the same site, it dates from the second half of the 10th century b.c.e. (Stratum III) and was discovered within a basin in a building of unidentified function. It is carved out of limestone, fenestrated, with a tripod base (which the excavators describe as zoomorphic) and a comparatively very small and shallow bowl. The upper part of the foot shows a double register of "d?cor foliac?" (Levy/Edelstein 1972, 339). The petals are highly stylized, their tips look as if cut off, which gives the petals a square appearance. A stone stand from Megiddo, Stratum VA (loud 1948, pi. 254 no. 4), with a similarly stylized leaf decoration around the stand may be compared to this. Another famous example was found at schumacher's excavations of Megiddo (schu macher 1908, 126-128 fig. 190)33, in what the excavator termed a "von [. . .] sechs Mas seben umgrenzte[r] Raum[. ..]" (schumacher 1908, 126) and attributed to his sixth stratum (corresponding to the Oriental Institute Expedition's Stratum III, i.e. 780-650 b.c.e., cf. Harrison 2004, 13)34. Schumacher recorded the vessel (plus a fragment of an identical vessel) as a "R?uchergef?? aus grauem, weichem Kalkstein", originally measuring ca. 60cm, with a colorfully painted double garland of pendent leaves at the top of the foot, topped by a relatively small and shallow bowl35. 32 For an initial overview cf. Kletter/Ziffer/Zwickel forthc. 33 Cf. Watzinger 1929, 40.79; May 1935, 21 fig. 6. 34 However, Watzinger (1929, 80) assigned the vessels to the older "palace" structure. 35 The above collected evidence is flanked by many fragmentary finds of which the following may be mentioned: 1. Fragments of chalices with leaf d?cor. Fragments of chalices' feet with leaf d?cor are numerous. The most famous example is certainly the one recorded by Macalister from his Gezer excava tions (Macalister 1912 II, 337 fig. 460). The excavator assumes that the stand has lost "at the top the cup with probably an upper row of lotus leaves" (Macalister 1912 II, 336), but whether or not the cup indeed featured an additional row of petals of course is speculative. In any event, the Gezer example is described as being "covered with a cream-coloured wash, on which the coloured decoration was applied" (Macalister 1912 II, 336), a description which reminds of the decoration of the Kinneret specimen, even if, in the latter case, the painting seems to be less elaborate. The German excavations of Megiddo under schumacher brought two fragmentary stands to light (Schumacher 1908, 73 fig. 97; Watzinger 1929, 36.39 [fig. 37J.48) which both feature a single garland of leaves around the stem. According to Watzinger, both originate from the "Schicht ?ber der 'Nordburg'" and therefore are to be dated to the Iron Age. Another early account of two bowl fragments with petal decoration which were understood as remains of chalices comes from Lamon's and Shipton's report on the excavation of Megiddo, Strata I-V (Lamon/Shipton 1939 pi. 33 no. 15.17.63, chalice types no. 15.17). If the assumption that the bowl fragments indeed once belonged to such vessels were correct (which given the remaining fragments is by no means certain), these decorated bowls would form close parallels to the find from Kinneret. The fragments were assigned to the 11th century b.c.e., Stratum V (Lamon/ Shipton 1939, 170; note however that no. 15 was a surface find). Both specimens feature additional painted decoration, executed in circles on the bowls' outside and, in one case (pi. 33 no. 15) also the inside. A further find from the same stratum (Lamon/Shipton 1939, pi. 38, ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="14">28 Gabriele Fa?beck 4. 4. Metal Thymiateria Already in 1980 Stern pointed to the relationship between clay chalices with petal d?cor and metal thymiateria which are mostly known from the 8 th century b.c.e. onwards and originate mainly from the region of the Phoenician colonies in Spain and Portugal (Stern 1980, 98). While Assyrian and Canaanite traditions of craftsmanship seem to be responsible for the development of the form, at a later stage Phoenician merchants mediated this type of vessel to the west36. Indeed, it is in these metal works that we rediscover the slender and elegant forms that the decorated clay chalices display and it becomes obvious that the chalice from Kinneret has part in an artistic tradition of cultic vessels that extended from Assyria into the Levant and later, mediated by the Phoenicians, into the western parts of the Mediterranean. This obser vation accords well with other finds of fine ware from Kinneret Stratum V, especially of early Phoenician style jugs. Relations with the coast were obviously conducted in the Early Iron Age, either directly in the form of trade contacts (import of wares) or indirectly via general cultural influence (Pakkala/M?nger/Zangenberg 2004, 20-22). Recently, franz (1998-99) has provided a concise discussion of 99 known metal thy miateria which attest to the wide variety of shapes found in these vessels and the longevity of this type of object (from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age down to the Roman era)37. From Franz' classification of thymiateria according to the shape of their bowls, feet, petal registers, etc. emerges a type of thymiaterion relevant to our study which is distinguished by a unclassified, no. 3) is a fragment that resembles a chalice foot with two rows of (now damaged) petal decoration attached to its upper end. The lower part of this fragment also displays two circles as painted decoration. Further examples are recorded from: a. Beth-Shemesh (Grant 1932, pl. XXXVI no. 30), the dating of which is not clear from the publication, but the fragment certainly reminds of other examples from the Iron Age period. b. QatnalTell el-Misrife in the Orontes Valley of Syria - here two fragmentary chalice feet were recovered, both with traces of painting (du Mesnil du Buisson 1928, pl. LXXXIII fig. 5; pl. LXXXIV Cer. 89.90). The publication describes them as coming from "deux grands vases" and dates them "du commencement de l'?ge du fer" (du Mesnil du Buisson 1928, 298). Cer. 90 is especially interesting for its double garland of leaf d?cor. According to the drawing pi. LXXXIV, this fragment has an additional leaf d?cor at the bottom, with the very unusual and somewhat questionable feature of these leaves pointing upward rather than drooping (possibly the illustrator misunderstood the composite photograph rendered on pi. LXXXIII). c. Tell Kazel in Syria (Gubel 1995, 120-121 fig. 1 a). Of interest here is an 8th century b.c.e. "fragment of a red washed petal bowl, the petals of which alternate in vivid red, black and white colours" (Gubel 1995, 121). Gubel opts for the reconstruction of an incense bowl from this fragment. 2. Fragments of leaf d?cor. Mention should be made of two fragments, recorded from the excava tions at Samaria (Crowfoot 1957, fig. 25 no. 10.11), one consisting of two petals and thought to be originally part of a censer by the excavators, the other being possibly a "stem of miniature censer" with leaf decoration. They were assigned to Period VI, i.e. the 8th century b.c.e. Yadin's excavation at Hazor has yielded a fragment with petal d?cor which was originally considered to be part of a jug rim. Only two leaves are preserved ( Yadin et al. 1960, pl. CXV 12). The fragment originates from Stratum 3 which was assigned by the excavators to the Middle Bronce Age II. A p?trographie analysis recently carried out on this sherd has proved its Canaanite origin as opposed to the Cretan provenance assumed earlier (dothan/zuckerman/goren 2000). Two more small fragments which in the excavators' estimate once formed part of pedestals are listed among the inventory from the Southern Temple of Stratum V in Beth-Shean (Rowe 1940, pl. XVIII no. 6.13). 36 Niemeyer/Schub art 1965, 80; Stern 1980, 97-98; cf. further Zwickel 1990, 140. 37 For an older overview cf. Blazquez 1975.

Franz includes seven examples in this category 38. In addition, Franz (1998-99, 82 fig. 12) cites another specimen closely related stylistically with conical foot, fixed bowl and two drooping leaf registers around the foot known from a tomb at Palaepaphos, Cyprus and dated to the 2 nd half of the 11th century b.ce. This vessel is the oldest of its kind of metal and for chronological reasons is of immediate interest for the Kinneret chalice. We may assume that metal and clay vessels, both most probably used in ritual contexts, existed parallel at least since the Early Iron Age in the eastern Mediterranean. It is, however, hard to determine whether the clay vessels imitate the metal ones or vice versa. While Franz (1998-99, 86) suggests that "the bronze examples [. ..] try to imitate a form originating in clay or limestone" given that "the fixed incense bowls show less filigree" compared to other types of metal thymiateria, the opposite can also be and has been (Watzinger 1929, 40; Ornan 1986, 104) maintained on the basis of the impression that the unusually elegant shape of one-part clay chalices with petal decoration and conical foot imitates in cheaper material the more precious metal variant. Following Franz' analysis, there is a notable chronological gap in the distribution of petalled metal thymiateria with conical foot and fixed bowl. Apart from the 11th century b.ce. example from Palaepaphos, vessels of this type are next known only from the end of the 8th century b.ce.39, and geographically confined to the Iberian Peninsula. This gap in the metal vessels' distribution is certainly not mirrored by the decorated clay chalices in the Levant, given that relevant specimens are attested from the late 11th century b.ce. (Kinneret), 10th century b.ce. (Rehov), and 10th through 7th centuries b.ce. (Ekron, Tell es-S?fi). From the distribution of currently known metal thymiateria on the one hand, one-part decorated clay chalices on the other, it seems that the clay chalices are predominantly represented in the Levantine inland whereas metal thymiateria are not known in this region (with the exception of the late 5 th century b.ce. thymiaterion from the vicinity of Shechem discussed by Stern [1980]). One example of a Phoenician metal thymiaterion from Cerro del Pe??n, of the province of M?laga, Spain will be singled out here since it presents a particularly interesting parallel to the Kinneret chalice. The Spanish thymiaterion, however, dates much later, to the 8 th or 7 th century b.ce. (NlEMEYER/schubart 1965, 83)40. With a comparable height (18.5cm), this thymiaterion, too, features a conical foot surrounded by a garland of drooping petals and supplemented by a fixed bowl. While there is no disagreement among commentators in interpreting the foot's decoration as a ring of pendent leaves, there are differing understand ings of the bowl's shape. Stern referred to its decoration as "patterns of elongated leaves" (1980, 98). While Franz' (1998-99, 79-80) reference in this context to "rosette bowls" comes close to Stern's interpretation, Niemeyer/Schubart (1965, 75) speak of a "flache Schale mit geripptem Boden" instead which would have its closest parallels in Assyrian bowls of the same era41. Hachmann/Penner (1999, 122) in their discussion of bowls from 38 Franz 1998-99, 85-86: two from Tamassos, one each from C?stulo, Cerro del Pe??n, Shechem, one from the Collection de Clerq in the Louvre, one from the Walters Art Gallery. 39 Franz 1998-99, 99, with the problem that most of the thymiateria in this category are not from securely dated contexts. 40 The thymiaterion has repeatedly been discussed: Niemeyer/Schubart 1965; Hestrin/ Stern 1973; Stern 1980; Franz 1998-99 passim; Hachmann/Penner 1999, 123. 41 This type of bowl most probably originated in 8 th century b.c.e. Assyria and was subsequently exported to the west, cf. Hestrin /Stern 1973, 154. ZDPV 124 (2008) 1</page><page sequence="16">30 Gabriele Fa?beck the Iron Age cemetery of K?mid el-L?z also address this form of decoration as "dicht neben einander stehende[. . .] Rippen" which can "unterschiedlich ausgebildet sein [...]: mandel f?rmig, kugelf?rmig oder oval". While Assyrian bowls may not always strictly imitate floral designs ("leaves"), but often rather abstract geometrical patterns ("Rippen"), the thymiaterion from Cerro del Pe??n seems to emphasize the floral aspect. It therefore comes very close to the Kinneret chalice's petal decoration of the bowl. The find from Kinneret can yield additional support for Stern's interpretation of the d?cor of the bowl from Cerro del Pe??n as a garland of leaves since it demonstrates that a double corolla of petals distributed around foot and bowl was known in the decoration of chalices already early on. If this interpretation is tenable, then the 8 th century b.c.e. Phoenician thymiaterion is the only vessel known to this author that combines all decisive formal features as found in the decorated chalice from Kinneret: conical foot, fixed bowl, one garland of leaf decoration around the upper part of the foot, another one embellishing the bowl42. 5. Conclusion The excavations at Tell el-cOr?melKinneret have provided the to-date earliest example of a one-part chalice with petal d?cor on a conical foot in either clay or metal. The chalice provides the earliest parallel in clay to the widely distributed metal thymiateria of the same shape which are known only from the Iron Age II onwards. The close connection between vessels fashioned in these two materials cannot be denied. Since generally metal thymiateria seem to have been known in the 11th century b.c.e. already, as attested by the thymiaterion from Palaepaphos, and assuming that clay vessels imitate more expensive metal objects, a good case can now be made for the existence of thymiateria with conical foot, fixed bowl and petal decoration already in the Early Iron Age. It is possible that the specific shape of a metal thymiaterion with petal decoration around both bowl and foot also goes back to that early time, if the Kinneret chalice indeed copies contemporary metal examples. Whether the dec orated chalice from Kinneret was fashioned there or imported has yet to be determined. Given that its artistic execution is not overly sophisticated (certainly much less than the later paral 42 Other thymiateria which are usually discussed in this context only display one garland of leaves surrounding their feet. This applies to the two similarly designed objects, one from the collection de Clerq (Niemeyer/ Schub art 1965, 82), the other a find from a tomb near Shechem (Stern 1980, 95). It is also true for a chalice-like bronze stand, now in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore which Stern (1980, 96.98) discusses, and which is usually assigned to 7 th century b.c.e. Spain. This latter thymiaterion parallels closely the chalices from Tell es-S?f? with which it shares the conical foot, the leaf decoration surrounding the foot's upper part, and the straight-sided bowl with (in this case) a straight rim forming a right angle to the sides of the bowl. Two more objects which are similarly fashioned are depicted by Blazquez (1975, 264 fig. 10, pl. XCIV fig. 94A; pl. XCIX fig. 99B). Furthermore, a metal thymiaterion with tripod stand and double leaf d?cor around the stand, now in the Museo Arqueol?gico Nacional, Madrid (Blazquez 1975, pl. CI fig. 101 A) and another one, also with tripod stand, but displaying a triple leaf garland and two flat bowls arranged one above the other (Blazquez 1975, pl. CLI fig. 151C) are related. Finally, a miniature clay stand from Cyprus, now in the Cyprus Museum, should be mentioned which evidently imitates thymiateria of the type found in Shechem. It features a small, sharply carinated bowl and a leaf relief around the stand. The object is especially interesting in that it provides further evidence for the close relationship between metal and clay stands.

This, of course, would imply that the local artist was familiar with the relevant vessel forms of metal craftsmanship. The chalice's domestic find context is not surprising in light of the later finds from Rehov, Ekron and Tell es-S?fv, instead this seems to be the ordinary. Promising research remains to be done on the exact function of this kind of cult vessel and on the question of which deities' rituals required such cultic paraphernalia.
