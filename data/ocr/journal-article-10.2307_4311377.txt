Aspects of architecture and the phenomenol- ogy of urban construction will be discussed within a broader thematic inquiry on Qajar Isfahan in two parts. The first discusses the various historical images of the city while the second will focus on the major trends of Qajar architecture in Isfahan within this context.' Research on Qajar art and architecture in Isfahan has been largely guided by an inquest on the former Safavid capital as a center of high politics and culture. This narrow focus accounts for historiographical and interpretational lacunae in the study of Qajar architecture in Isfahan. The following discussion hence is a first exploration of the city's architectural structures and one that frequently raises more questions than answers. While there are several exhaustive invento- ries of the city's historical buildings, ultimate answers will require more fleld research on Qajar archaeological and architectural remains. Rather than insisting on the uninventive topos of Qajar destruction of Safa- vid architectural iconography, the challenge is to trace and explain the process of urban and architectural change and transformation in the nineteenth century. This paper endeavors to identify the socio-cultural context and provide an etiol- ogy of repair and destruction rather than an art-historical analysis of specific buildings or conclusive answers to the problems raised by Qajar architecture in Isfahan. It aims instead at a critical discussion of common conceptions and topoi of Isfahan's nineteenth-century morphology, based on understanding the most central cultural and historical premises of Qajar Isfahan. Because of the strong dialectic or interdependence between Persian and European accounts of Qajar Isfahan, the question of sources is a recurring ele- ment of this debate. Europeans have left a vast body of descriptions of Oriental cities and their testimonials are often the only accessible sources. In the case of Isfahan in particular, it is almost impossible to avoid European accounts and with them the dilemma of Orientalist stereotypes and personal biases.

Chardin, for example, is quoted by all the available published Persian accounts, Malcolm's narrative was well known in Isfahan, and Curzon has been read by almost all European and Persian authors writing after publication of his voluminous Persia and the Persian Question.2 Typically nineteenth-century descriptions of Isfahan are notoriously brief. Travelogues, as well as unofficial diplomatic and political reports, characteristically summarized Isfahan in a few paragraphs with reference to the comprehensive ac- counts of earlier works, especially that of Chardin.3 Although almost every nine- teenth-century traveler makes some mention of Isfahan, its appearance as well as its internal urban structure of the time remains elusive. In the 1850s the British consul Keith Edward Abbot wrote several reports about Persian cities. His journal from Isfahan was the shortest of his comprehensive accounts and in no way compares with the detail and information of his more interesting descriptions from the Cas- pian coast, Azerbaijan or even Yazd. Typical of the explanations advanced by nineteenth century observers of Isfahan, Abbot, who considered it one of Persia's most interesting cities, justifled his brief treatment by the fact that Isfahan had already been described exhaustively and therefore was considered so well known that even a comprehensive report could contribute nothing new. The limited scope and detail of nineteenth-century descriptions of Isfahan were consistently excused with this very argument, although Isfahan remained the second city and the leading center of Shicite theology within the borders of Persia. Politically it was an extremely complex-and in commercial terms, international-urban center. 2. Muhammad Mahdi Arbab, for example, refers extensively to Chardin and Kaempfer, i.e. see his Nisf-i jahan ft tacrif al-Isfahdn (Tehran, 1340/1961 and 1368/1989, 178-79), as well as contemporary European accounts, like Malcolm (ibid., 135-36, 180). He mentions a foreign travel account of more than a thousand bayts, that somebody had shown him, (ibid., 136-37). Other authors writing about Isfahan, like Husayn ibn Muhammad Ibrahim Tahvildar Isfahani, Jughr4ftyd-yi Isfahn, Jughraftyal-yi tabtcT va insanr va amar-i asnauf-i she1hr (Tehran, 1342/1963), have extensive references to Chardin and some mention of Kaempfer and other Europeans. 3. There is a clear line of continuity in themes and images in European accounts from the Venetian travelers of the 15th century (who had read the Greek accounts of pre- modem Persia) to those of the nineteenth century. Descriptions of Isfahan by European traders and explorers of the sixteenth and seventeenth century had a lasting impact on European as well as Persian perspectives on nineteenth century Isfahan. The growing political interest of England and France in Persia in the nineteenth century was paralleled by the intensive reprinting and republishing of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century travel and country descriptions by writers on earlier missions, like the physician and explorer Kaempfer (who was in Isfahan in 1684-85), Pietro della Valle (in Isfahan in 1619), Thomas Herbert (there in 1628), Sir John Chardin (there in the 1660s and 1670s), John Fryer (1677), and numerous others. Nineteenth-century travel accounts and histories absorbed the themes and perspectives of their sources, heavily relying on these earlier works for their own descriptions of Isfahan.</page><page sequence="3">Face of the Seven Spheres 329 References to the descriptions of earlier travelers and the city's Safavid grandeur have something anachronistic and appear often as threadbare apology to cover the difficulty of exploring the city in the face of its closed and sometimes hostile reception of inquisitive foreign agents or emissaries of the central govenment.4 Europeans were able to describe the city's surface, providing a phenomenology of the external, but usually had little access to what was behind the facades and high walls. Narratives and pictorial representations were often nostalgic or inordinately negative and most writers relied uncritically on the prevailing stereotypes. Based on these sources, the lasting image of the Qajar city and our understanding of it are superficial, or at best, incomplete. Aiming to write the ultimate country report on the Persia of his time, George Curzon was the first to make a detailed investigation of the city. His assertive and authoritative style of writing, his encyclopedic coverage of the country's geography, politics, people, and art, as well as his own interest in Mughal art and architecture, and the inside information which he obtained through the British Foreign Office, made his two-volume Persia and the Persian Question one of the most influential and, for Isfahan, most consequential accounts of Qajar Persia. A staunch supporter of late Victorian imperialism, viceroy of India from 1898-1905, and foreign secretary from 1917-1924, Curzon visited Isfahan in search of the Safavid city and with an unambiguously imperialist outlook on Persian history. Because of its status as bygone capital and its legendary imperial splendor, Curzon harbored a passionate interest in Isfahan. Most European travelers cut short their accounts when describing Isfahan, usually referring the reader to Jean Chardin's comprehensive yet anachronistic treatment (already two centuries old). Curzon, who had good connections to British officials in Persia and was driven by a strong personal interest, had less hesitation than most of his contemporaries about exploring, judging, and re-evaluating Isfahan. His account of the city thus was more comprehensive and critical than that of any other contemporary work and it made his opinions about Isfahan the most influential of the time. Curzon was engrossed by and reiterated the prevailing impressions of Qajar Isfahan's decadence and decay, and by doing so he promoted and permanently reinforced that topos. His uncompromisingly negative and disdainful verdicts about the city in the late 1880s, combined with his late-Victorian imperial aesthetics, profoundly influenced the image which Europeans as well as Persians themselves held of the city. The oxymoronic condition of the traditional-old and the modem-new, the glorious and the debased, the legendary and the real city, was inseparably attached to all aspects of Isfahan. Europeans as well as Persians of the nineteenth century continued to associate Isfahan with its image at the heyday of the Safavid empire. Approaching Isfahan with this kind of historicism, travel books, newspapers, and magazines painted an evocative picture of Safavid imperial magnificence which reinforced the aura of cultural decay and political decline of the Qajar city. 4.

Their accounts remained generally focused on the urban surface where Safavid eminence continued to loom over Isfahan. It was Safavid Isfahan which remained the standard of comparison for the city they encountered.5 This discrepancy between the imaginary and the real city was usually expressed with a great deal of pathos. Descriptions by late nineteenth-century visitors reveal an intense degree of nostalgia for the architectural and political achievements of CAbbas the Great, an unconcealed reverence for the Safavids in general, and a concomitant disdain for the Qajars. "European images of the Oriental city were dominated by a sense of decay, retrogression and death," summarized one scholar of European views of Middle Eastern cities. "For most Europeans," he stated, "ithe Oriental city was a barbaric, hysterical, and violent place," which was described in "picturesque, and usually condescending," terms, as a place "in a permanent state of Dantesque pandemonium."6 Virtually every European traveler who came through Persia visited Isfahan and the countless descriptions they produced depicted the city in these or similar terms. Like many other Middle Eastern cities, Isfahan was seen as a lamentable remnant of its former imperial greatness, a relic of imperial power and symbol of decline and decay. "Under the depressing influence," of the events following the Afghan siege, commented Curzon in 1891, "Isfahan has fallen from its high estate, and now in perpetual sackcloth and ashes-no inapt metaphor to apply to the present appearances of the town-bewails an irrecoverable past."7 Although occasionally daring to contradict Curzon (for example in her description of Julfa) the missionary and traveler Isabella Bird, also expressed the prevailing European sentiment and joined in the regret over what was considered the cheap Europeanizing transformation of the form and mastery of classical Persian art and craftsmanship. This despite the fact that the Europeanization and modemization of politics, industry, commerce, and society, at least rhetorically, were promoted as not only desirable but indispensable. Bird was impressed by the splendor of the Tehran residence of the foreign minister Mushir al-Dawla and the palaces of the NaDib al-Saltana (the governor of Tehran, minister of war, and third son of Nasir al-Din Shah) and Mascud Mirza Zill al-Sultan (governor of Isfahan and son of Nasir al-Din Shah), but she found the European furniture, modern colors, and decorative accessories then fashionable among the ruling elite ugly and unpleasant.

Eastern civilization is doomed, and the transition period is not beautiful, whatever the outcome may be."8 Most authors insinuated the innate relationship between aesthetics and politics, which Bird expressed in explicit terms, a relationship which was considered an obvious fact in the case of Isfahan. The paradigm of Qajar decay and decline has been influential in shaping negative and unenthusiastic attitudes, images, and approaches to post-Safavid Isfahan to the extent that, in a metaphorical sense, the city has almost "ceased" to exist. Increasingly critical revisionist studies have discussed images and por- trayals of Middle Eastern cities in the nineteenth century within the paradigm of Edward Said's Orientalism. Yet, despite the prevailing notion of the significance of conurbation and urbanism in Iranian history, there are few comprehensive historical studies of Iranian cities, which is one reason why nineteenth-century depictions still govern our understanding of cities such as Isfahan. While the high Islamic art and the palatial architecture of Safavid Isfahan have traditionally received a significant amount of interest and research, the period following the 1722 collapse of the Safavid state has, almost axiomati- cally, been considered an era of decline and disintegration in artistic as well as political and social terms. Isfahan's form, its architectural matrix, and the com- plex process of urban change during the Qajar period, have hardly been studied, neither in political, commercial, cultural, nor artistic terms, despite the city's enduring political and cultural importance. The difficulty of tracing the evolution of the architectural structure and urban morphemics of Isfahan is further compounded by the fact that there are hardly any accounts about its buildings and urban environment in the 18th century. This makes it even more difficult to analyze Qajar Isfahan in a coherent historical sequence and outside its overwhelming Safavid semiotics. Hence, despite the gap of a century and its impact, the first mapping of Isfahan's architecture and morphology remains dependent on a discussion and the lasting influence of the Safavid city. Although there are distinct political, cultural, and artistic characteristics of Qajar Isfahan, developments and changes did not follow a linear or necessarily consistent trajectory, but often contradictory patterns of decline and growth appeared. For the architectural topography there are distinguishable trends of preservation and new construction, yet these were dependent on circumstantial economic conditions, the inclinations of the urban nobility, as well as the authority and mood of the governor. This inquiry presupposes that the city, its iconography, and its architecture formed part of a historically continuous process, as well as a component and a product of a socio-political system and thus an expression of power, prestige, and wealth. The discussion of architecture in the second part of this study, hence, pays considerable attention to personalities and patronage, trends, and self-images. 8.

While this criticism may be justified, it ought to be asked how much this was motivated by autocratic calculation or practical economic considerations. Even though numerous historical buildings were demolished at his orders, it is difficult, on the basis of available sources, to trace the precise demolition of specific buildings, the motives for their destruction, and the circumstances under which they were destroyed. Many of the buildings seem to have been khJulisa property, controlled by the crown, and may not have been the Zill's direct responsibility. A critical inquiry into demolition and ownership, again, raises more questions than answers. To blame the Zill al-Sultan for the lamentable destruction of Safavid buildings is persuasive but simplistic.9 It belies the complex process of urban change, private motives, internal city politics, Isfahan's relations to the court, as well as plain financial interest. The Zill al-Sultan was governor of Isfahan for more than thirty years. His appointment to the governorship of Isfahan had been both banishment and reward and was also the expression of Nasir al-Din Shah's personal and political ambivalence about Mascud Mirza's aspirations and political claims as eldest son. Appointing Zilla al-Sultan to Isfahan distanced him from the center of power; at the same time Isfahan, the former capital, famous for a tradition of intractable antagonism to the central government's suzerainty and for an independently-minded elite, was probably one of the most precarious and important governorships of the "Guarded Domains" (mamalik-i mahrusa). This ambivalence between royal ambitions and provincial rulership decisively determined the Zill al-Sultan's attitude towards Isfahan's architecture. His authoritarian rule of the city, his systematic acquisition of additional governorships by which he garnered command over almost half of the country's territory, together with his outstanding military force, was proof of his mastery of politics and his vast ambition. The Zill al-Sultan was the only governor with no prior relationship to the indigenous elite who was able to make himself leader of the elite and turn Isfahan into his own domain. Caught between his own 9. This is a charge brought against the Zill al-Sultan by, among others, Sayyid Yahya Dawlatabadi, who when visiting his native Isfahan in 1337/1918-19 sardonically commented on the appearance of the of the city, explicitly condemning Zill al-Sultan for having systematically pursued the destruction of Safavid buildings. (See Dawlatabadi, Hayat-i Ya.hy 4: 12.) The supposed numbers of the buildings destroyed by the Zill's authority differ drastically. Arbab, or his editor Manuchihr Sutudeh, claims he destroyed 23 ancient buildings in one fell swoop. (See Muhammad Mahdi Arbab, Nisf-i jah4n, 36, n. 1.) Mihrabadi mentions seventy buildings and, citing Ansari and cAli Janab, lists the Hazar Jarib; the Namakdan; the Bagh-i Farrashkhanah north of the Chihil Sutun, torn down in 1896-97; the Bagh-i Darughah, which was acquired by a nephew of the Zill; the Bagh-i Darughah-i Daftar, which went to the son of Aqa Najafi and was eventually sold piece by piece; the Bagh-i Tavuskhanah, which was given to Mirza Hadi Khan, a servant of Zill al-Sultan and was sold several times, part of it being eventually replaced by the Madrasa-i Sitarah-i Subh and another building. (See Asiir-i mill, 21, 81, 36112, 675.) Bamdad lists 28 gardens and buildings by name.

In the 1870s and 1880s, during the early years of his governorship, the Zill al-Sultan sponsored extensive renovations of Safavid palatial buildings and the bazaar. By systematically building up his military power with new barracks and parade grounds he influenced the appearance of the city. After his fall from power in 1888 with his dismissal from all of his governorships except that of Isfahan, palatial buildings and other structures were increasingly neglected and from the 1890s onwards, demolished or sold off. Major land and other real estate transactions were undertaken during and after the Constitutional Revolution. If the Zill al-Sultan harbored any feelings of revenge or even deliberate intent in the neglect of the Safavid buildings, it had little to do with the Safavids, whose royal power had been defunct for nearly two centunes. There may have been an element of spite directed at his father, Nasir al-Din Shah, and perhaps even at the British, who had extolled Isfahan as the epitome of Safavid political and cultural achievement and whom he increasingly resented for their ambivalent positions and their failure to support him. Most importantly however, there was money to be made by the sale of gardens and buildings and not only by the Zill al-Sultan. Historical Premises The vital stages of Isfahan's history are relevant not only to placing Qajar Isfahan into a meaningful context, but also to comprehending the Isfahanis' keen awareness of the history and lasting significance of their city. This self-understanding was essential to the morphological and the urban-architectural semiotics of the nineteenth-century city. Isfahan has been an important urban center since its origins as a military camp during Sasanid rule.10 Its strategic economic and political situation, agricultural advantages, and abundant supply of water provided dependable conditions for its development into an influential metropolis and determined the recurrence of historical cycles of prosperity and decline and repeated rise and fall as imperial or provincial capital. In the tenth and early eleventh century, Isfahan was the headquarters of the Buyids. Despite turmoil in the political leadership, the Buyid administration presided over a period of prosperity for Isfahan. Among other things, Rukn al- Dawla fortified the city with a wall and the large fortress of Tabarak was built, as were numerous outstanding official and private buildings, baths, liveries, parks, and gardens." During Buyid times, Isfahan was the largest and most dynamic 10. See A. T. Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire (Chicago and London, 1970), 20, 226 and Ernst E. Herzfeld, Archeological History of Iran (London, 1935), 12, 46, 53. 11. The fortress of Tabarak was built during the governorships of Mu'ayyid al-Dawla and Fakhr al-Dawla Daylami in 976-77. Under Ilkhanid rule it was also used as a prison. It was destroyed by Shah CAbbas, when the citizens of Isfahan pettioned him in protest against the extortions of Ahmad Beg Girampa, the commander of the fort.

Tughril Beg, cAla al- Dawla's rival and successor, recognizing the city's strategic and environmental advantages, moved his capital from Rayy to Isfahan and spent there the last twelve years of his reign and considerable sums on construction projects in the city and its immediate environs.12 By the tenth century Isfahan had evolved into a thriving commercial metropolis at the center of the trade routes between East and West and was extolled as "the second Baghdad."13 It achieved more political importance when adopted as capital by the Saljuqs in the eleventh century. The borders which outlined the domains of the Great Saljuqs placed Isfahan at the core of their empire's territories.14 Its economic prosperity and life as cultural and intellectual center was Ganjfnah-i dsdr-i tdrikht-yi Isfahan, (Tehran, 1350/1971) 37-40 and, Iskandar Beg Munshi, Thrikh-i Clam-ard-yi CAbbdsi, ed.

Such comparisons were underscored by stories about the cAbbasid caliph al-Mansur's alleged idea of making Isfahan his capital. 14. Under the rule of Malik Shah (1072-92), Saljuq Isfahan reached its cultural and political zenith and emerged as one of the chief centers of Sunni theology in the Islamic world. This was also a period of architectural activity. Malik Shah's vizier Nizam al-Mulk (1018-92) established the famous theological madrasa, the Nizamiyya, in the Dardasht quarter. Numerous official and private buildings and mosques were built, including the masjid-i jdmic and the Saljuq maydan. Tha Saljuqs also built large royal gardens like Baghat- i Chaharganah (Fourfold Gardens) outside the city, Bagh-i Bakr, Bagh-i Karan, Bayt al-Ma' (Water House), Bagh-i Ahmad Sayyah, Bagh-i Dasht-i Gur (Garden of the Plain of the</page><page sequence="9">Face of the Seven Spheres 335 closely tied to the presence of the Saljuq court and government. There are many eulogizing verses and descriptions of Isfahan's extraordinary climate and excellent water. It was frequently likened to a beauty mark on the face of the earth and Sacd al-Din Haravi wrote, The likewise of the uppermost paradise is Isfahan, Isfahan There is no city like it from Kairuan to Kairuan.15 and Khaqani Shirvani claimed Fatimid and Ayyubid Cairo was nothing compared to Isfahan. "al-Qahira is the sacrifice to the sovereign of Isfahan," he wrote.16 Many of the emblems by which Isfahan was known as an outstanding city-its geographical advantages, fertility, beauty, sophistication, and tradition as leading world center of learning, culture, and trade, all of which were the hallmarks of Safavid Isfahan and still survived into the nineteenth century-seem to have roots in its position as Saljuq capital (and perhaps even as Buyid center). Isfahan's fortunes deteriorated after Malik Shah's death in 1092, but were reconstituted for a brief period under Muhammad b. Malik Shah from 500/1106-07 until his death in 511/1118 when the Saljuq empire disintegrated into separate sultanates. Because of its ecological advantages and its strategic commercial location, Isfahan outlived the drastic political changes and the recurring epidemics and famines, which resulted in cataclysmic demographic and economic changes over the following two centuries, and endured as a natural urban center on the western Iranian plateau. The city survived the Mongol conquest of the 1240s largely undamaged, although its position under Mongol suzerainty was tenuous at best.'7 By the late fifteenth century the Venetian patrician, Ambrogio Contarini (1429-99), who traveled to Persia in 1474-75, felt it "appeared to be a very convenient city," surrounded by a wall and "abounding with all kinds of provisions," which were provided by fertile mountains. His companion, Josafa Barbaro, described the houses in the villages and the city as agreeable and found the city populous, with many a rich inhabitant, a great many noticeable antiquities, good clear water, and an outstanding bazaar.'8 Modem historical memory undoubtedly identifies Isfahan's greatest epoch with Safavid rule, when it was re-created as the empire's capital. It was conquered and forced to recognize Safavid suzerainty by Ismacil in 1502, who along with his Onager), as well as the forts Qalca-i Shahr, and Qalca-i Diz Kuh. See: E. G.

In the seventeenth century, at the height of the Safavid territorial extent, the empire replicated the geo-political pattern of the Saljuqs, again placing Isfahan at the center of the empire's crossroads. By moving his court and the seat of government from Qazvin to Isfahan in 1006/1598,19 Shah CAbbas recognized Isfahan's geographical advantages and commercial importance. The monumental layout of his city and its architectural appearance, consisting of his and his successors' palaces, mosques, bazaars, and gardens determined Isfahan's lasting physical and architectural profile. During the Afghan interlude, following the end of Safavid rule in 1722, allegedly some 20,000 people were kiWled in fighting and random atrocities, while about four times as many inhabitants fell victim to starvation and concomitant epidemics.27 The population was further diminished by refugees who sought safety in India and the Ottoman empire from the threats of political bedlam, social insecurity, massacres, hunger, and disease. With the capitulation of the Safavids, Isfahan, like the rest of the empire, fell victim to the political turmoil of a decade of intermittent civil war. Despite the economic and political upheavals, the city remained the country's political center until it lost its status as royal residence and political capital when Nadir Shah seized the tirone in 1736 and moved his headquarters to Mashhad, the provincial capital of Khurasan. About three decades later, Karim Khan Zand established his court in Shiraz. In 1785, Aqa Muhammmad Khan, founder of the Qajar dynasty, in a well- thought-out military and strategic move, chose Tehran as his capital. His intent was both to reject Shiraz, the capital of the Zand dynasty where he spent the early part of his life as hostage and to forestall being absorbed by the enduring shadow of Safavid kingship at Isfahan. An essential factor in the evaluation of the prosperity and juxtaposition of Safavid and Qajar Isfahan has always been the size of the population. The drastic decline of its population from its supposedly flourishing state during the heyday of Safavid rule has often been conveniently cited as proof for the limp shape and decadence of the Qajar city. The fluctuation in the number of inhabitants during the nineteenth century is critical not only with regard to the city's rise and fall but also for a sensible evaluation of its morphological and architectural change. Although the demographic changes following the fall of the Safavids were fundamental to the politcal and economic profile of the city in the nineteenth century, the documentary basis of population figures for both Safavid and Qajar Isfahan is extremely weak and the numbers that are available are highly 19. The motives and timing of the move have been extensively discussed. Ansari, Tartkh-i Isfahan, 189 says the decision was made in 1005/1596-97 but the development of the city as capital took place over the period 998-1008/1589-1600. Stephen Blake recently re-opened the debate; see S. Blake, Half the World: the Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590-1722 (Costa Mesa, CA, 1999), a review of the work appearing in this issue. 20.

Nonetheless, population figures continue to be measured according to the large, yet unproven and probably unrealistic numbers of the seventeenth century.2' The size of the population during the nineteenth century appears to have remained more or less constant, ranging between seventy and eighty thousand souls.22 With the rise of Tehran as Qajar capital, the urban status, political importance, and metropolitan image of Isfahan inevitably faded, even though the title as well as the tenor of the city's epithet nisf-ijahMin (half the world) survived and at times was used with deliberate calculation. Although never an autonomous city-state like a medieval or Renaissance European city, because of its wealth and agricultural self- sufficiency nineteenth-century Isfahan asserted itself as a semi-autonomous polity with a tradition of defiance of the royal government's authority. It was dominated and led by a strong merchant class and an extremely powerful and independent ulema, inspired by an indigenous historical self-confidence and pride. Isfahan had been a theological center at least since Buyid times; during Saljuq rule it was dominated by the Shaficite and Hanbalite schools of law and was the abode of a large number of scholars of the Islamic sciences, as well as poets, writers, and physicians. Almost five centuries later the Safavid's systematic patronage of Shicite ulema revived Isfahan's tradition of theological learning and scholarship. While the dense net of madrasas, scholars, and students was weakened during the brief periods of Afghan rule, Nadir Shah's regime, and the civil war of the eighteenth century when the vaqfs and landed properties were dissipated and many of the leading ulema emigrated to the Shicite shrine cities (catabMt) in Ottoman Iraq, Isfahan never completely lost its role as theological center. In the early 1 800s it was revived as the principal center of Shicite learning in Persia with close scholarly and social ties to the catabiat. Also reviving a historical precedent, it rebuilt itself as one of the most important centers of commerce, claiming the country's largest bazaar by 1910. The city's commercial revival, which was largely propelled by the opium boom of the 1860s, as well as the restoration of its religious leadership and the hierocracy's consequent ideological and political reassertion were visibly reflected in its morphology and architecture. Legacy of the Safavid City Several of the images (and perhaps even the epithets) which imply Isfahan's greatness and which are largely associated with Safavid Isfahan date back at least to Saljuq times. Some of these were adopted and perhaps deliberately harnessed and revived by the Safavids. The topography of the post-Saljuq city was devised by 21. The decisive number remains Chardin's claim of 600,000 inhabitants in the mid- seventeenth century.

The fact that the bridge, which connects the lower and upper Chahar Bagh was built by and carries the name of Allahvirdi Khan, the commander in chief (sipahsill4r), who was second only to the shah in military command, is both an obvious tribute to its builder, and contains an unmistakable reference to the territorial and hegemonic connotation of the city's design. The semiotics of the location and the architecture imply political and cultural as well as religious hegemony. Under the religious patronage of the Safavids, Isfahan developed into the foremost center of Shicite theology and orthodoxy in the Islamic world. Shah CAbbas and his successors intended to assert this in architectu- ral terms as well. With the building of the Masjid-i Shah he aimed to surpass both the Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and the Kacba in Mecca, two of the holiest places in the domains of Islam.25 This also indicates Isfahan's self-perception of being at 23.

Isfahan had decisive geo-strategic advantages. It was closer to the eastern borders and the Persian Gulf than Qazvin or Tabriz and it was still close enough to the western frontiers, which were occupied by Ottoman troops. Hafez Farmayan stresses the origin and trdition of Isfahan as an old Iranian city, pointing to the fact that choosing Isfahan as capital was also a sign of the Iranization of cAbbas I's regime. F. Hafez Farmayan, The Beginnings of Modernization in Iran: The Policies and Refomis of Shah CAbbas 1, 1587-1629 (Salt Lake City), 1969. The motives and time of cAbbas I's decision to make Isfahan his capital has been extensively discussed. 25. Munshi: Tanrkh, 831. Notions of space, territory, and the theoretical system behind Safavid rulership were unified and exposed in the quadripartite formation of the city's topographic design, royal gardens and architecture. The quadripartite delineation of Safavid Isfahan denoted the hierarchical order of the cosmos, mapping the position of the world and the shah within it. The city was at once the creation and the reflection of the king's domain. 'Abbas I's conception of Isfahan perpetuated the function of garden as an allegorical and symbolic political order on multiple levels. It centered in the intemal space of palace courtyards and from there expanded to the level of the walled palace and government gardens of the Bagh-i Naqsh-i Jahan, to the next level of the city with its axial center from where it extended to the level of the province, and after that to the expanse of the empire's domains. This pattern can be seen to perpetuate itself beyond the teritory of the empire, encompassing the globe and reaching from there to the metaphysical world of the universe-to the seven spheres of heaven, and ultimately to the 'arsh, the throne or seat of God. An excellent</page><page sequence="13">Face of the Seven Spheres 339 the center of the world, a view still prevalent in the early twentieth century. The physical as well as cultural-historical legacy of the Safavid city cast a lasting shadow on Isfahan's morphology, its architectural and its political idiom. Although subject to a continual process of change, nineteenth-century Isfahan never was able to bridge the gap between the architectural corporeaity of the Safavids and the city's relentless, large scale modernization and expansion under twentieth-century Pahlavi rule. In spite of important additions to the city's sacral buildings and the construction of a few, mostly private, secular buildings, Qajar Isfahan fell short of creating a lasting, independent, 2physical profile and invariably remained overshadowed by its Safavid visage. While the city no longer carried the grandeur of the seventeenth century and certain quarters as well as many Safavid buildings deteriorated, its essential Safavid character maintained a pervasive presence. Until the massive restructuring of urban modernization in the late 1920s the old Saljuq center and distinctive Safavid palaces and mosques and the myriad gardens and trees determined the city's profile. Aside from the most cardinal urban features such as the bazaar, caravansaries, large mosques, and administrative buildings, the dominant theme of Isfahan's external and internal structure was the motif of the chahar biigh (literally, four gardens). Next to the bazaar and the mosques, the Hasht Bihisht, the Chahar Bagh Avenue, cAbbasabad or Hazar Jarib, and the Bagh- i Naqsh-i Jahan, being the most renowned of the large garden parks, survived as the most characteristic visual and structural attributes of the city.27 Although the political and social premises changed, the topographic and architectural structure of the city's plan outlasted the Safavids. It survived the Afghan siege and the city's loss of status as the seat of government and continued to dominate its morphology, its materialist expression of power, as well as its self- perception throughout the nineteenth century. The successors to the Safavids and their provincial administrators inherited this physical and architectural order. The semiotics of Isfahan's physical urban structure remained an homage to Safavid kingship; its historical memory and collective psychology were shaped by Safavid cultural and political achievements. The lasting and pervasive architectural presence and the symbolism and iconography of Safavid notions of kingship and power had a direct political significance, for they raised the highly sensitive question of Qajar legitimacy at the levels of both provincial and central visualization of this structure is the diagram of J.

At the same time it is difficult to trace the continued use of Safavid buildings; and, both in terms of architectural and urban development, the nineteenth-century city was not static, but adopted its own face, shape and aura, ambition and style, dtrust forward by the conflicting goals of traditionalism. conservatism, and modernization. Except for the 'Imarat-i Sadr, which was built at the beginning of the nineteenth century in the garden of the Chihil Sutun; the garden Chahar Bagh-i Chinarsu or Bagh-i Naw on the south side of the Zayandah Rud; the newly styled garden Bagh-i 'Imarat-i Haft Dast-i Khaqani28 and the Bagh-i Bihisht-i Baran, the latter two built or added to an older structure during Fath CAli Shah's reign and both decaying over the course of the nineteenth century; the Zill al-Sultan's palace garden Bagh-i Naw29 as well as a few smaller private residences, the prominent palace gardens of Isfahan were essentially the legacy of Safavid rule, as was the entire city's plan, in which the theme of chaihair bagh and the principle of "garden" (in the Timurid sense as the place of royal residence and headquarters) remained essential exponents of the city's intemal rationale. Although reduced to the status of provincial capital, and decimated and dilapidated, Qajar provincial government and urban life took place within this physical framework. Hajji Muhammad Husayn Khan and later his son CAbd al-Husayn Khan, the beglarbegis of Isfahan, continued to use the Safavid government buildings. Manuchihr Khan Muctamid al-Dawla made the Ima-i Khurshid in the northwestem comer of the Bagh-i Hasht Bihisht his private residence. The Zill al- Sultan, before building the Bagh-i Naw at the turn of the century, had his residence and government divan mosdy in the Safavid Chihil Sutun. Almost illustrating the dichotomous division between the state and the ulema, his chief political rival and antagonist Aqa Najafi, preceded by his father, Shaykh Muhammad Baqir, had his domain in the great Safavid mosque, the Masjid-i Shah. Heading the revolutionary council after the Zill al-Sultan's dismissal in 1907, the Aqayan-i Masjid-i Shah moved the political offices again to the Chihil Sutun. Urban Allegories: from the Dar al-Saltana to the Qubbat al-Islam 28. See: Abu'l-Qasim RafiCi Mihrabadi, Asiir-i millY-yi sfah&amp;n (Tehran, 1352/1973), 81- 82. To what extent this is an extension of the Safavid Haft Dast, is unclear from Mihrabadi's reference. 29. Bagh-i Naw ("New Garden") was a favored name for the gardens built by the Qajars, to contrast them with the gardens of the Safavids and Zands, many of which carmed more portentous, traditional names. The adjective naw carried the deliberate insinuation of a thing contemporaneous, new, and progressive. It indicated reform and implied a departr from un-modem conventions. It was also an expression of self-definiton with a conscious emphasis on the contemporary. The Qajars employed both naw and jadrd as a means for deliberately placing themselves in a new era. It was also partly a rhetorical attempt to equalize the unsolvable tension between traditionalism and the need to advance in a rapidly modemizing world.</page><page sequence="15">Face of the Seven Spheres 341 People in nineteenth-century Persia related to cities almost as anthropomorphic beings with idiosyncratic characteristics, as places of consubstantiality providing protection, community, structure, and identity to the individual. Cities were often described with an element of intimacy and admiration. Large cities carried the aura of sovereignty and personality, suggested by titular epithets. The most important Qajar cities carried (and many still carry) titles, a common practice throughout the Middle East, with an essentially representational element but often allegorical, implying a connotational, cultural, and political meaning, as well as status, rank, pride, and function.30 In the late eleventh century, when Malik Shah made Isfahan his capital, he gave it the pretentious title "Dar al-Khilafa," (Abode of the Caliphate).3' After becoming the Safavid capital in the late sixteenth century, Isfahan held the regal title "Dar al-Saltana," (Abode of Royalty or Kingship), which was also held by Tabriz and Qazvin, the earlier Safavid capitals. As the shah's residence, probably before being chosen as capital city by cAbbas I, Isfahan was also referred to as "Maqarr-i Saltana," distinguishing it as the shah's residence. "Dar al-Saltana," however, was a lasting indication of royalty and a title which continued to be invoked in Qajar Isfahan even though it had lost its status as capital.32 The Qajars also bestowed this title on Tehran, but the epithet's Safavid origin continued to associate it with Isfahan.33 The abiding identity as royal city weighed heaviest in Isfahan, whose citizens continued to revel in their town's lasting patina of royalty and always felt a certain resentment and disdain for Tehran, which they viewed as an urban imposter and parvenu. Among the images used by nineteenth-century Isfahanis to express their sentiments about the city and province's status, its geography, and productivity, as well as their own self-perception was an allegorical camel. In this image, Tehran, which was one of the chief markets for Isfahan's goods, was viewed as the load on the camel's back of Isfahan, a burden it was forced to carry. Visualizing the hump- backed camel on the map requires a great deal of imagination, but more important than any physical resemblance to a real camel is the implicit self-definition, 30. Kirmanshah was known by the epithet "Dar al-Dawla" (Abode of Government); Burujird as "Dar al-Surue' (Abode of Happiness); the title of Yazd was "Dar al-cIbad.a' (Abode of Worship). Shiraz, held the title "Dar al-Mulk" (Abode of Sovereignty), and also, for its safeguarding the tombs of Sacdi and Hafiz, the title "Dar al-CIlmrn (Abode of Learning), an epithet Isfahan, as the center of Shici theology, would have liked to claim as well. 31. See TCankh-i Guzida or Select History of Hamd'ulla Mustawfi-i Qazwini, Compiled in A.H. 730 (A.D. 1330), ed. Edward Granville Browne (Leiden and London, 1910), 449.

In order to distinguish Tehran fiom Isfahan as the residence of the shah and the first city, as well as in political competition with the Ottoman capital Istanbul as seat of the caliphate, Tehran, which under Fath CAli Shah also held the title "Dar al-Islam," later received the title "Dar al-Khilafa," introduced by the Qa'im Maqam, as well as a third competing title, "Dar al-Nasiri," which it later held under Nasir al-Din Shah's rule.</page><page sequence="16">342 Walcher expressed in this comparison to a beast of burden whose breath and bones kept the country going, served as the essential lifeline of long-distance communication supplying the rest of the country, yet was more noble than a mule, and whose every body part was an invaluable contribution to human subsistence.34 Despite its loss of status as the royal capital, Isfahan retained a great deal of self-esteem and perhaps vanity from its importance and resplendence as the Safavid capital, the abiding allegory of Isfahan as a paradisial garden, as chosen place with special benison and divine benediction. The latter was a concept dating back to Buyid and Saljuq times, when Isfahan was considered the "navel of Iraq."35 The late Saljuq poet Jamal al-Din Isfahani asked euphorically, "Have you seen Isfahan, that city like Paradise; that holy cypress, that soul nourishing Eden. That palace of the nation and that throne of government; That face of the seven spheres, that eye of the seven lands."36 This qasrda alluded to Isfahan's central position in the world and the universe, which was revived by the Safavids and survived into Qajar times. The city was always proud of the exceptional fecundity of its earth, river, and climate. The fertile environment was compared with the opulence of paradise, whose plains "are all saffron and whose mountains are all honey, and in each of whose houses is a fountain of sweet, pure water." Although really situated in the third clime, Isfahan was construed as the center of the fourth clime, which in Ptolemaic cosmology was the best of the earth's seven astrological zones, each of which was presided over by a planet.37 The definition of the geographic location of Isfahan in this world system has been used to explain its fertility and prosperity. The location has played an important role in justifying its eminence as a city and the attribution to it of such paradisiacal qualities as khuld-i barin or khuld-i paykar (the uppermost level of paradise). Shah cAbbas I was conscious of this ascription of qualities and deliberately built the city to compete with the world. Isfahan was the center of the province and the midpoint of the Safavid empire. The city's epithet 34. Ansari, Tarrkh-i Isfahan, 94-96. Also see Carl Ritter, Die Erdkunde von Asien (Berlin, 1840), 6: 24. 35. A definition used by Abu Hatim of Sistan, see E. G.

An anecdote regarding the favorable climate of Isfahan recounted how an Isfahan merchant was asked by the Grand Mughal in Delhi what he considered the most beautiful place on earth. The merchant, not daring to say Isfahan, answered "my house." Prompted for clarification by the puzzled Mughal, he explained that the fourth, that is the middle of the seven climes, was the best; in it Iraq was the most beautiful province and Isfahan the first city in the province of Iraq, the quarter of Sacadatabad not far fiom Julfa was the most beautiful of the city's quarters and his house the best house in it.

Although these metaphors seem tenuous after the Afsharids, Zands, and Qajars had abandoned the city as capital, Isfahanis continued to assert their pride in this urban self-image. Muhammad Hashim Asaf known as Rustam al-Hukama, chronicler and native of Isfahan, left no doubt that when Aqa Muhammad Khan Qajar conquered Isfahan, despite almost a century of civil war, the city was still viewed as paradise.38 Along with the political and commercial changes of the late nineteenth century, especially the victory over the British Tobacco Regie in 1892 and the elite's attempt to revive Isfahan's textile industry in the late 1890's, the clerical and merchant nobility contrived and touted a new image for the city, stressing Isfahan's commercial, religious, and industrial importance. While keeping the traditional titles, Isfahan was now proclaimed the "Qubbat al-Islam," (Cupola of Islam), and "Dar al-Sanayic," (Abode of Industries). The title "Qubbat al-Islam" was a tribute to Isfahan's Shicite orthodoxy and piety, a reassertion of the ulema's own importance and their aspirations for the ideological authority of Islam. Among Europeans Isfahan had the image of "one of the most Mussulman cities in the world." Fearing the influence of the ulema in Isfahan, Europeans always felt intimidated by the religious fervor and "fanaticism" of the city.39 The Arabic word qubba meaning both cupola and tent also carries the connotation of navel-navel of the heavens-which makes it the religious counterpart to the secular, i.e. geographical and political navel of Iraq.40 The epithet "Dar al-Sanayic" indicated the continued irnportance of Isfahan's traditional craftsmanship, evoked its former importance in the textile industry, and expressed the new industrial assertiveness of the city's merchants and ulema in competition with European manufacturers. Both of these trends found expression in architecture, and account for the large number of new mosques and the lesser known but often ostentatious private residences of the merchant nobility. Gardens, Palaces, and Mosques Qajar theories of state and government were based on ancient Persian principles of kingship, but were weighted against Safavid contentions of metaphysical and theologically founded legitimacy.

Evoking this decline, European topoi of the decadent Orient, cliches like the "Sick Man of Europe" (for the Ottoman Empire), the "Eastern and Persian Questions," and popular Orientalist and imperialist ideas of the Orient's former greatness and its contemporary decline contributed greatly to the image of nineteenth-century Isfahan, which had become the reification of Persia's lost power and Qajar political and cultural degeneration. The juxtaposition of former magnificence and contemporary cultural syncretism, especially with regard to architecture and art, as well as a stark emphasis on the dialectic of fertility and decay were themes which were inexorably attached to late nineteenth-century Isfahan, to a large extent shaped by the copious, widely available, and popular European travel accounts. Contrapuntal descriptions of blooming orchards and gardens and architectural and cultural decay were almost universal in accounts about Isfahan. European writers deliberately juxtaposed their initial enchantment and enthusiasm at the first panorama of Isfahan with their fervent disappointment at the broken-down appearance of the real city. From a distance Isfahan seemed like a green jungle, or "one large garden;"4' countless travelers burst into panegyrics at the cityscape on the horizon, describing it as "embossomed in a forest of gardens and vineyards,"42 and hailing the majestic and captivating "profusion of gardens and the domes and towers of mosques and palaces, rearing their heads from amidst verdant groves of poplars, sycamores, and cypresses of the most noble size."43 "The valleys and plains for many miles around Ispahan, are adorned with villages and plantations; and the first view which the traveler has on coming from Shirauz, of this great metropolis, is from an eminence, about five miles from the city, when it bursts at once Son his sight, and is, perhaps, one of the grandest prospects in the universe.'

Sir John Malcolm remembered that "nothing can exceed in beauty and fertility, the country in the vicinity of Isfahan, and the first appearance of that city is very imposing. All that is noble meets the eye, the groves, avenues, and spreading orchards, with which it abounds, concealing the ruins of this once famed capital."45 An American business traveler, who arrived after nightfall at a caravansary outside the town described how in the morning the city had risen magnificently in front of them, "as if from some magician's wand." But, in the city "everywhere the eye detected poverty and ruin, showing the greatness of its fall," the majority of the population, seemingly "living in abject poverty and shiftlessness."'46 "A nearer view," of Isfahan, wrote Malcolm, "dispels the illusion." Nevertheless, he was captivated by the city, feeling that still much remained of "wealth, if not of splendor, and were I so disposed, I might write a volume on its beautiful environs; its palaces, splendid even in decay, its college, with massy gates of silver, its magnificent bridges, its baths, its arched bazaars, its fountains, its far famed river Zindeh-rood, and the gardens on its banks, shaded with lofty sycamores, and filled with every flower and fruit of the temperate zone."47 Both the disintegration and the continued fascination remained a topos, reiterated by hundreds of travel and news writers throughout the century. By the late nineteenth century, many of the great Safavid palaces deteriorated through neglect and disregard. A myriad of buildings was unused, abandoned and disintegrating. Because the city and villages expanded toward the west, that is the first access to water, along the eastern rim innumerable villages had been abandoned and fallen into ruins. The most prominent and persistent theme of the nineteenth century was the dialectic between growth and decay, and the tension between traditionalism and modernism in political, social, as well as architectural terms. Isfahan had to recreate itself and synthesize the historical with the contemporary or modem both in political as well as artistic and architectural terms.

Despite corrosion, the architectural landscape of Isfahan survived as topographic and political memoir of the domain of cAbbas I and his heirs, which created both a certain uneasiness and a continued challenge to Qajar iconography; to some extent it was even an expression of the Qajars' persisting difficulty in asserting their suzerainty over the city. The historical context of Isfahan, combined with the city's physiognomy, in which the legacy of Safavid supremacy remained acutely present, made it difficult for the political successors to arrange themselves in the confines of the old and proud capital. In the early nineteenth century a number of palaces were built, but in spatial as well as political terms there was little room for ostentatious Qajar palaces in Isfahan. Nineteenth-century palatial architecture and gardens shaped the new capital Tehran, and more as well as larger Qajar gardens were built in Shiraz and Tabriz than in Isfahan.48 The tides of splendor and boom, followed by devastation and decay, were a recurring theme in Isfahan's annals. By the late nineteenth century, however, the paradigm of decline has become identified with the irreversible state of the zeitgeist and time; the decay and disintegration of Qajar Isfahan was emphasized and expounded to the point of negating the fact that the city was alive and transforming under Qajar rule. One essential aspect in the discussion of nineteenth-century Qajar approaches to the Safavid city and Qajar architecture is the fact that Isfahan was no longer the capital, with inevitable consequences for its architecture, such that many Safavid palaces, no longer used by the city's ruling elite, had lost their purpose. Architecture was created and used in a socio-political context, which determined the scope of new construction, function, style, and form. Natural deterioration and socio-economic change also required new constructions for changed purposes. The simplistic topoi of the city's nineteenth century decline, naive Europeanizing Qajar kitsch, and architectural un-inventiveness, thus, ought to be reconsidered on their own terms. Construction and architectural aspiration in nineteenth-century Isfahan were inseparably tied to the state of the city's overall prosperity, the affluence and beneficence of the city's leading patricians, the relationship of the Tehran court to the city and, to some extent, the self-image and prestige in which the city 48. Among the Qajar gardens in Shiraz were the Bagh-i Naw owned by Husayn CAli Mirza Farmanfarma, governor of Fars for forty years and eldest son of Fath CAli Shah; the Bagh-i Hasht Bihisht and the Bagh-i CAfifabad or Gulshan, both owned by Mirza CAli Muhammad Khan, the Qavam al-Mulk; and the Divankhanah and the Naranjistan also owned by the Qavam-Shirazi family. A number of older Shiraz gardens were renovated during Qajar times, among them the Bagh-i Iram and the Takht-i Qajar known by that name since the coronation of Aqa Muhammad Shah and later simply as Bagh-i Takht The Sacdiya, too, until renovation in 1952, had a Qajar-style pavilion. Whereas extensive research has been done on Islamic gardens through various epochs, very little has been published about Qajar gardens. See e.g. Donald Wilber, Persian Gardens, Muhammad-Nasir Fursat Shirazi, Asir-i cAjam, (Bombay 1313/1895), and Mahdi Khansari, M. Riza Moghtader, and Minouch Yavari, The Persian Garden: Echoes of Paradise, (Washington D.C., 1998).</page><page sequence="21">Face of the Seven Spheres 347 perceived itself at various times during Qajar rule. There was an apparent trend of change and progression between the early and late nineteenth century and early Qajar Isfahan felt obviously closer to its time-honored urban importance and Safavid past. The most active period of new construction in Isfahan took place during Fath cAli Shah's reign in the early nineteenth century. The Guarded Domain's political consolidation inaugurated a period of renewed self-confidence. For Isfahan this meant restoring its former glory as well as making a contemporary imprint on the city's physiognomy. (to be continued)</page></plain_text>
