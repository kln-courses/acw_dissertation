Ihursday afternoon, May 13th ; Sir George Birdwood, K.C.I.E., C.S.I. , M.D., LL.D., in the chair. The Chairman, in opening the meeting, said : - It is superfluous to introduce the reader of the paper to the distinguished audience assembled in this historic room,- not only to 1 е;ч h in read his paper, but to greet himself wiih the heartiest welcome, - his name being a household word among all of us who are interested in the inspiring current history of India, as that of one of the two select Indian gentlemen - the other being the Nawab Imad al Mulk, of the Hyderabad Peerage, Syed Hossain Bilgrami, C.S.I. - appointed by His Majesty the King Emperor, to be the first Hindu and Muslim members, respectively, of the Council of the Secre- tary of State for India, Lord Morley of Black- burn. Mr. Krishna Govinda Gupta was chosen from the Indian Civil Service, wherein he long ago earned the enviable reputation he holds among his colleagues, - than which no man can possibly acquile any higher honour for himself; for there is no surer guarantee of a man's real intellectual and moral superiority, and official and personal worth, than to have thus approved himself a creditable and accept- able member of the most capable and efficient, and the wisest and the most beneficent organisation for imperial rule the world has ever known. At the same time a place in our " Council of the Indies," as they would style it in Spain, confers on Mr. Krishna Govinda Gupta a distinction of its own, and assures him an abiding niche in this sovereign island's temple of official fames ; and our pleasure in his having won his way into what is in reality an extension of the Imperial Cabinet is beyond any common pleasure, and is indeed the predominating sentiment that has gathered us together to-day to do him all the honours in our power. With these words of unfeigned and fervent welcome- facing the East after the ritual of Fairy Land, which still includes India - I respectfully commit the meeting to the commanding spell of Mr. Krishna Govinda Gupta's discoursive charm. The paper read was : - SOME PHASES OF HINDUISM. By Krishna Govinda Gupta (Member of Council of India). Introduction. The population of India is 294 millions ; and by religions it includes over 207 million Hindus (70 per cent, of the total), nearly 62$ million Mussulmans (21 per cent.), about g£ million Buddhists (3 per cent.), nearly all in Burma, leaving 6 per cent, for all other re- ligions, including nearly two million Christians (two-thirds of whom are in Madras and Tra- vancore), nearly 2¿ million Sikhs, over million Jains, 94,000 Parsees, and over millions described as Animists. These figures bring into prominent relief the important position occupied by the Hindus among the peoples of India, an importance which is based not merely on their numerical superiority, but also on their material and intellectual pro- gress. Hinduism Defined. At the outset one is met with the difficulty that there are few words so undefined or so incapable of precise definition as the word Hindu, although most people have an idea, more or less vague, of what it refers to. A Hindu may be said to be one who professes a particular form of faith known as Hinduism, though this brings us no nearer to a right understanding of either term. The word Hindu did not originate with the people who are now designated by that name. The earliest Aryan settlers and their de- scendants through many centuries never called themselves " Hindus" or their re- ligion Hinduism. The word is of com- paratively recent origin, and was first intro- duced probably by the Persians, and it is not difficult to see how it came into general use. The great river Indus, which, in a manner, forms the north-western boundary of India, and which every traveller from the West has to cross, is described in Sanskrit literature as "Sindhu." Philologists will tell us that the letters s and h are interchangeable, and in- stances of pronouncing s as h are numerous in colloquial Bengali at the present day. Later visitors from the West who came as immigrants or as invaders, when crossing the mighty Indus, not unnaturally named after it the people inhabiting the country on the other side of the river. It is particularly the case with Mohammedan writers, and the name has also found currency in Europe, and has since been adopted by the Hindus themselves. Of the four great religions- Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam- which represent the living faiths of the world at the present day, Hinduism is the oldest, and, unlike the three others, it has not a historical origin, nor does it recognise a single prophet. Moreover, unlike Christianity and Islam,</page><page sequence="2">June 4, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 583 Hinduism has no one single book which is believed to emanate from the Deity and there- fore to be infallible, though the Vedas, the sacred books of the Hindus, are regarded with great veneration, and there is a tendency to claim for them a divine origin. No Books of History. Hinduism has not been incorrectly repre- sented as the most comprehensive and elastic of the world's great religions, and this characteristic is the natural outcome of its growth and development through many centuries. The Hindus possess no his- tory in the ordinary acceptation of the term ; no one has yet been able to com- pile a connected account of the Hindu period, say from 2000 B.c. to 1000 A.D., for the obvious reason that the Hindus never had any true historians among them ; and in this respect they widely differed from the Greeks and Romans on the one hand and the more modern followers of Islam on the other. This absence of historical instinct, this indis- position to put on record past and current events, has been ascribed to the essential spirituality of the Hindu mind, which looked upon earthly life as a mere drop in the great ocean of existence, and the wordly achievements of individuals or races as being of minor importance altogether. However, whatever may be the reason, the fact remains that the Hindus have no books of history. There are indeed coins, copper plates, rock inscriptions, archaeological remains, genea- logical tables, legendary and other materials from which fragmentary accounts of Hindu rulers and emperors have been prepared especially with the help of such contemporary records as have been left by Greek writers and Chinese travellers. While we thus deplore the absence of a systematic account of the political growth of the nation, we have reason to be thankful for the great wealth of religious, tradi- tional, scientific, philosophical, and literary works which has been handed down to us, and from which one can form a fairly clear notion of the .spiritual development of the people and of their manners, customs, and social organisation from the earliest times to the present day. In thus forming a picture of Hindu civilisation we are greatly indebted to the critical labours of Western scholars, which have enabled us to divide the whole period into distinct epochs, each covering several centuries and each marked by certain well- defined features. Aryan Immigration Vedas. Without trespassing on any specially con- tentious ground it may be observed that the southern branch of the great Indo-European race poured in a mighty stream into the fertile plains of the Punjab, where the first Aryan settlement took place not later than 2000 B.c. and probably many centuries earlier. The Aryans came as conquerors and had to wrest the land from the indigenous occu- pants of the soil, the process being a comparatively easy one owing to the greatly inferior civilisation and physique of their opponents. The Aryans of those days worshipped the elements - such as fire, wind, sun, dawn, &amp;c. Each patriarch was also the family priest and the sacred fire was kept alive in every considerable Aryan dwelling. The period was one of wars and conquests against the aborigines, and in the Vedic hymns the Aryans make triumphant references to their successes and implore their gods to make them all powerful against the barbarians. The expansion of such a virile race was only a question of time, and the Aryan settlements rapidly extended to the valleys of the Jumna and the Ganges, and in course of centuries the whole of the fertile plains of northern India was occupied, and offshoots of them pene- trated from time to time to central and south- ern India, until the greater part of the Penin- sula was more or less leavened with the spirit of Aryan civilisation. With the political growth and expansion of the Aryans, their religious beliefs and practices also underwent marked changes. The Vedic period was followed by the second epoch, in which there was an immense development of forms and rituals on the one hand, and on the other attempts wrere made - sometimes suc- cessfully - to peer through the elemental deities and to grasp the idea of a Supreme Being who was above the elements and whose spirit per- vaded the creation. The Upanishads, which were composed during this period, when divested of their pantheistic garb, went as near as possible to the conception of a supreme Providence - one without a second - all-powerful, all-merciful, and absolutely pure and benevolent. It should be remembered that the Upanishads came into being more than 1000 years B.c. The third period wit- nesses the substitution of the simple faith of the Vedas, and of the more sublime concep- tion of the Upanishads by an elaborate and complex system of ritual and sacrifice on the one hand, and the growth of a critical and</page><page sequence="3">584 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. june 4, 1909. philosophic spirit as a protest against cere- monious observances on the other. The most notable event of this period is the birth, in the sixth century before Christ, of Sakya Muni or Gautama Buddha, whose religion of love and benevolence became in the next or fourth period, commencing with the reign of the great Asoka, in the third century before Christ, the dominant faith not only of India, but of the greater portion of South-Eastern Asia. Buddhism.- Introduction of Image Worship. Up to this time, that is, for some 2000 years, the religion of the Aryans was free from idolatry or image worship, and temples, shrines, and places of pilgrimage were practi- cally unknown. Although Buddhism was a protest against class distinctions and sacer- dotal supremacy, yet it may be said to be directly responsible for the introduction of images for the purpose of worship, and from the fact that there are no pre- Buddhistic temples to be met with in any part of India, it may be inferred that Buddhism greatly fostered, if it did not introduce, the erection of temples for enshrining images, a practice which must have received a considerable im- petus from the close contact into which the people of India were about this time brought with the Greeks through the conquests of Alexander the Great, and the intimate inter- course maintained with his successors by the princes of India. In course of time, Buddhism lost much of its pristine purity and simplicity, and received superstitious and idolatrous accretions- so much so that to this latter-day Buddhism may be traced the growth of Tantric worship, which is the worst and the most revolting form of the latest phase of Hinduism. The fifth and last epoch, which may be said to commence about 500 A.D., is marked by the steady de- cline of Buddhism, and the revival of Hinduism in a form in which image worship was the main feature. Priestly imagination ran riot, and the Hindu pantheon was filled with innu- merable gods and goddesses, even trees, rocks, hills and rivers being requisitioned for the purpose, and it is more than probable that it was during this period that a great stimulus was given to the reception of the aboriginal tribes within the fold of Hinduism, their rude and uncouth deities being assigned places, though subordinate ones, in the mythology of their more powerful neighbours. It is interest- ing to note that notwithstanding the low social status assigned to these tribes in the Hindu social body, they have always shown much eagerness to be admitted into it, although such admission meant the discarding of some of their best customs, such as adult marriage, absence of caste restrictions, &amp;c. Later Hinduism. Buddhism marks the dividing line between ancient and modern Hinduism, and one cannot help feeling regret that the great movement in- augurated by Sakya Muni to free earlier Hin- duism from priestly domination, and to intro- duce a purer and more philosophic religion, should, after a long career of success, eventually end in the re-ascendency of Hinduism, but in forms and under conditions which were infinitely worse than those of the earlier faith. The orthodox Hinduism of the present day is, there- fore, not the Hinduism of the pre-Buddhistic period, but the debased form which rose on the ashes of Buddhism, and which adopted and amplified its system of image worship, and magnified the importance of shrines and pilgrimages. It seeks inspiration, not from the Vedas, with their simple nature worship, nor from the Upanishads, with their lofty spiritual ideals, but from the more recent Puranas, with their extravagant legendary tales, and from the more dubious works known as the Tantras. Elasticity of Hinduism. The above brief retrospect of the growth of modern Hinduism enables one to realise how it has come to be so comprehensive and shown such capacity for absorption. Octopus-like, Hinduism has swallowed up and assimilated the various cults and faiths that have from time to time appeared on the soil of India. The religion of Gautama Buddha differed in all its essentials from the Aryan faiths which preceded it, and which it very nearly sup- planted, and yet at the end of a thousand years Buddhism had disappeared completely from the land of its birth, and Buddha had become one of the many Hindu incarnations, so much so that a knowledge of that wonderful movement was revived in India in recent times only by the studies and researches of Western scholars. The savage hosts of Sakas, Scy- thians, Huns, and others, who from time to time burst upon the Indian continent with irre- sistible force achieved but transient triumph, for no sooner were they settled in the country than they bowed to the superior Aryan civilisa- tion, and were content to be received in the</page><page sequence="4">June 4, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 585 Hindu fold, and become part and parcel of the Hindu social organisation. Even the Greek settlers in the Punjab formed no exception to this general rule. Coming to more modern times, the only two faiths that have successfully resisted this absorbing process are Islam and Christianity, for the main reason that fresh preachers and adherents have continued to come to maintain their connection with the parent bodies. Yet in Southern India, where Catholic Christianity has made the most progress, caste is often recognised by the Indian converts, and it is conceivable that under old conditions Christ would have been given a place in the Hindu pantheon and his followers admitted as a sect of Hindus. Kabir, in the fifteenth century, headed a movement to bring about reconciliâtion between Hinduism and Islam, and the great Emperor Akbar entertained hopes of introducing a common religion for all his subjects. It may be remarked that Hindus in many parts of India show the greatest veneration for Mohammedan ýzrs, or saints, and eagerly undertake pilgrimages to, and make offerings at, their shrines. In the domain of logic, theology, and philo- sophy Hindu writers occupy an unique position, and excel in all schools of thought, their magnificent works being the admiration of the learned of all nations. It will thus be under- stood how Hinduism contains tenets, beliefs, and practices, one or other of which will satisfy all spiritual needs - from the loftiest form of pure monotheism- through various stages of pantheism, nature worship, atheism, philoso- phic scepticism - down to the grossest and most debased forms of idolatry. Hinduism, which is tolerant almost to excess, has seldom exhibited any missionary zeal ; it has, by a rigid system of caste distinctions and other restrictive methods, discouraged every form of direct conversion, and while it is constantly liable to loss of adherents by the proselytising activities of more aggressive faiths it cannot freely admit within its ranks converts from other religions. In these cir- cumstances the reason why the number of Hindus does not show any decline in the aggregate is that Hinduism has from time to time received large accessions from animistic races. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the growth of Hinduism has not kept pace with that of its powerful rival, Islam, which not only carries out a vigorous campaign of proselytism, but offers the tempting gift of social equality to its followers. Anthropomorphism. All kinds of idolatry aim more or less at representing the Deity in the form of man and ascribing to Him human affections and pas- sions, but anthropomorphism has nowhere been carried out to such systematic lengths as in modern Hinduism, and the worship of the various gods and goddesses that are enshrined in the innumerable temples mainly takes the form of offering to them food and services such as are enjoyed by princes and other people of affluence. The best illustration of this will be found in the ritual of the great temple of Jagga- nath, at Puri, on the coast of Orissa. There the domestic service of the idols is performed by 64 sets of servants, each complement hav- ing its duties assigned to it to the minutest detail, and nothing being omitted from the time of getting up in the morning to going to bed again at midnight - the mid-day siesta in- cluded. Cooked viands and light refreshments are served up at regular intervals, music and dancing being provided at the principal meals. The consecrated food is then partaken of by the pilgrims and other devotees, many of whom never eat any other. The temple kit- chen is so arranged that it can easily supply a meal for 50,000 people, and more, if necessary. There is ample provision of costly dresses and jewellery suited to different occasions and different seasons. The car festival represents the annual outing to the garden house. The extreme humanity of Hjndu religion is evidenced by the fact that the food served to the gods is wholly vegetarian, -and meat and fish form no part of it. No sacrifice of animals is permitted, and it has now come to be re- recognised that the loss of life which at times attends the car festival is not due to the blood-thirstiness of Jagganath, or a fanatical impulse of self-immolation on the part of the devotees, but is the result of pure accident. There is, however, one exception. The worship of a certain deity representing the active female principle of the universe is never complete without the shedding of blood, and she has even to plead guilty to a hankering for human sacrifice. It is not surprising that this dread mother, as her votaries call her, used to be invoked by the Thugs before they started on their nefarious expeditions, and is even now looked upon as the protectress of robbers, assassins, and other perpetrators of foul deeds. Main Features of Modern Hinduism. It would be a difficult task indeed to state</page><page sequence="5">586 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. June 4, i9o9. clearly what the orthodox Hinduism of the present day is. A few facts can, however, be predicated of it. It is mainly and substantially idolatrous, and image worship, in which anthropomorphism plays an important part, is its principal feature. It has many cults, many sects, each having its special gods and goddesses, but all combine to venerate the entire Hindu pantheon. It is non-congregational, that is to say, in Hindu temples there is no joint worship in the sense that there is service in a Christian church or Moslem mosque. The actual wor- ship in the temples is performed daily at stated hours by the priests - often with closed doors, accompanied by offerings of fruit, flowers, and cooked food. The votaries go in singly or in batches, simply to do obeisance to the idols and afterwards partake of the holy food. At home the orthodox Hindu after his morning bath and before he has broken his fast, daily worships his special deity, usually symbo- lised in a simple form, such as the Ungarn of the Saivas, or the small round stone of the Vaishnavas, the worship consisting of the offer of flowers and incense, and the recitation of certain formulae in Sanskrit. The Hindu has always been keenly alive to the beauties of nature, and every romantic spot, every towering peak, has for him a hallowed association which lifts him in a tribute of thankfulness to the Great Giver. In modern Hinduism the greatest import- ance is attached to pilgrimage, and in no country are there so many famous shrines as in India. Some of the large rivers are invested with great sanctity, the holy Ganges occupy- ing the foremost place in this respect, and bathing on particular days, marked by the conjunction of certain planets and in particular localities, is supposed to bring such excep- tional merit that, on these rare occasions, the gatherings are immense. The people in such cases will undergo any sacrifice or put up with any hardship or inconvenience to perform the pilgrimage. As in other countries, women form by far the largest number of pilgrims, for they are not only more subject to religious in- fluences than men, but in India a pilgrimage affords them the only chance of breaking through the seclusion of the zenana and seeing something of the outside world. Railways and steamers have done much to make pilgrimage easy and comfortable, but even in those days . when there were no such conveniences, and ' when the roads were mere tracks and were in- ] fested with robbers and highwaymen, it is j surprising what vast numbers visited the various shrines. In pursuance of the idea of a common reverence for all the deities the various sacred places receive attention, not only from their own adherents but from all other Hindus. Hindu Society Patriarchal. Ancestor- worship. Like that of most ancient peoples the social organisation of the Aryans was based on the patriarchal system, and the head of the family was always looked up to and regarded with respect and reverence. Veneration for the living led up to the worship of the dead, and ancestor-worship has been a prominent trait of Hinduism from the earliest times. Not only are elaborate funeral ceremonies performed at death and a few days afterwards, but оЪзедшев, in which libations to the manes form the chief feature, continue to be regularly performed for several generations, and also on every festive occasion as birth, marriage, &amp;c. No one is so well qualified to perform this duty as a male de- scendant, and it thus became a primary neces- sity with a Hindu father to have a son. This obligation was considered so paramount that, failing legitimate issue, various devices were adopted to supply the deficiency. In Manu no less than twelve kinds of sons are men- tioned, but at the present time only two of them are recognised, viz. (i), legitimately be- gotten, and (2) adopted. When adoption is decided on there is a formal transfer on the one side and formal acceptance on the other, accompanied by a solemn ritual, in which, in the presence of assemble-d relations and friends, the adopted son is made to lose his own patronymic and assume that of his adoptive parent. Henceforth he ceases to belong to the family of his natural father and is com- pletely grafted on to that of his adoption. The duty of making offerings to the manes was considered of such importance that the law of inheritance was based on the capacity for undertaking this function ; and whether a person can succeed to another's estate as his heir depends in a chief measure on his eligi- bility to perform the funeral rites. To this general rule the Nairs on the coast of Malabar in Southern India furnish the only exception. Among them it is the sister's son that succeeds, as the community does not observe the ordinary marriage customs. This rule of succession is in force in the princely houses of Cochin and Travancore, whose chiefs are Nairs.</page><page sequence="6">June 4,1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 587 Joint Family System. As a corollary of the patriarchal system, joint families have prevailed in Hindu house- holds from the earliest times, and are still to be largely met with in spite of the action of modern disintegrating influences. The system has its defects as also its merits. It certainly cramps and retards individual growth and de- velopment, and impairs the sense of personal responsibility and self-reliance. On the other hand, it teaches altruism and other virtues, and fosters love and affection for one's rela- tions. So long as there is a single bread- winner in the family all the members are cared for, while provision is made for all those, such as widows and orphans, who are unable to earn a living ; and anyone who out of selfishness fails to discharge this duty is strongly reprobated by his neighbours. It is thus that poor-laws and workhouses are un- known in India. It is no uncommon spectacle to see a man toiling and striving to support kinsmen who in this country would have no claim on him. Honouring Guests. A bright feature of Hinduism is the welcome extended to guests - not merely those who have been bidden to the house, but abso- lute strangers who may happen to seek food and shelter. Until quite recently hotels and hostelries were unknown in India, and even now they are found only in the larger centres of population. Rest-houses and serais were to be met with occasionally, but only along the main roads. In most places there was no accommodation for travellers, who had, there- fore, to rely upon the hospitality of the people of the localities through which they had to pass, and they did not rely in vain, for in every village of any importance there were one or two well-to-do people who kept open houses, where wayfarers of every description found food and shelter free at all hours of the day and night. There are many pious Hindus, both men and women, who would not break their own fasts until they have entertained some stray arrivals, for they believe in the Hindu aphorism, " A guest embodies all the divinities." Hindu Caste System : its Growth and Development. The one special characteristic which distin- guishes Hinduism from all other religions is its caste system. Class distinctions are familiar to all communities. Every society is divided into sections, the members of which group themselves according to certain common ties and interests based mainly on birth, culture and wealth. But there is no insurmountable barrier between the classes, which are con- stantly liable to loss and gain, and there certainly is no restriction as to food and drink. Caste, as understood by the Hindus, is, how- ever, of a very different kind. It is based solely on birth, and a Brahman however poor, how- ever ignorant, will rank higher than one of a lower caste who may be his superior in wealth and education. Then, again, in no other com- munity are there any restrictions of food and drink, but a Hindu belonging to a higher caste may not touch food prepared by one of a lower caste. A Brahman is, therefore, always' sought after for service as cook, for all other castes will eat food prepared by him and this goes on with every descending grade. There are also restrictions regarding drink, but they are not so severe as in the case of cooked food. The various castes and sub-castes are endo- gamous and no one may marry out of his caste, though within the caste a certain amount of exogamy is maintained by prohibiting marriage- alliances between families supposed to be descended from a common ancestor. The1 castes thus form, as it were, so many water- tight compartments without any communica- ting doors. In all civilised communities certain distinc- tions are observed for social purposes, but they are not rigid or stereotyped, and they can be, and are often, got over. No embargo is placed on food or drink, nor is there any prohibition of inter-marriage. But nowhere else in the world can anything be found at all resembling the Hindu caste system. Yet it was not always so rigid or exclusive. It is beyond doubt that the Aryan immigrants who crossed the Indus and occupied the Panjab were not divided into* separate castes. They formed one solid com- munity, held together by the strongest tie of common interest, and actuated by the common desire to triumph over the aboriginal tribes that opposed their progress and settlement. In those pre-historic times the patriarch of each family offered libations to the elemental gods, accompanied by hymns, very often of his own composition, at the sacred fire which was kindled and maintained in every house. He also fought battles against the common enemy, and in times of peace tended his flocks and cultivated his lands. In course of time, the Aryans grew and prospered, and spread out in different direc-</page><page sequence="7">588 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. $w 4, 1909. tions. The simple libations to the gods were replaced by elaborate ritual and sacrifice, and it became necessary for certain families to undertake the sole direction of all religious observances, and they thus formed the nucleus of a priestly class, which, by a slow process of evolution, hardened into the highest or Brah- manical caste. In the same way, the duty of fighting and governing came to be monopo- lised by others, noted for their capacity and bodily vigour, and these gradually crystallized into the kshatriya , or military caste ; and last of all, the great body of the people, the real workers - scribes, artisans, mechanics, and husbandmen formed into the third class - the vais ays. Outside the Aryan circle, were the despised aborigines, whom the new comers vanquished, and reduced to astate of serfdom, and they were the sudras, whose main occupa- tion was domestic service. The three highest castes were dwija , or twice-born, their initia- tion at an early age into the Aryan fold by a solemn ceremony, when they first took the sacred thread, being regarded as their second birth. For many centuries they enjoyed certain privileges in common, and marriage was per- mitted, not only among persons of the same caste, but men of a higher caste took brides from any of the lower castes ; and the restric- tions regarding food and drink were far less strict. The Aryans, like their modern representa- tives in Europe, were proud of their fair colour ; and it is interesting to note that the Sanskrit word for caste is varna , which liter- ally means colour, signifying that originally there were only two castes, viz., the white Aryans, and the aboriginal tribes of darker hue - a distinction which has manifested itself in another form at the present day, so truly does history repeat itself, and a just nemesis overtake all arrogance. Comparison with Medieval Europe. The phase of Aryan society, with its three- fold division into priests, soldiers, and workers, may not inaptly be compared with what existed in mediaeval Europe, where there were at the top the powerful body of priests and monks - the recognised exponents of religion and learning, next to them the barons and feudal lords, whose sole occupation was that of arms, and last of all, the great body of workers, who were looked down upon by the other two classes. But in Europe, the class distinctions never got stereotyped into the rigidity of Aryan castes in India. The vow of celibacy which, in Europe, the priest had to take, made the formation of a hereditary sacerdotal caste im- possible, and the military also continued to be recruited from the more daring and ambitious among the civil population. In India, the simplicity of the old caste system which at the beginning recognised only three Aryan classes and one non-Aryan, gradually disappeared, giving place to a more complex and elaborate social organisation in which the various guilds and professions were constituted into distinct castes, separated by many restrictions as regards marriage, food, and drink, and all exclusive and self-contained. The process was facilitated by the peculiar position of the Aryans in India. The country was surrounded by all but impassable barriers, which prevented active intercourse with the world outside, and within the conquerors •formed a select body jealous of their race and descent, and yet not quite suc- cessful in preventing the admixture of non-Aryan blood. There are many theories as to the origin of caste in India, but the one put forth here does not appear to be unreasonable - viz., that caste was the outcome of two factors, occupation and birth. While among the pure-blooded Aryans caste was almost entirely the product of varying occupations, many of the lower castes represent aboriginal tribes received into the Aryan community, and profession does not necessarily constitute a factor in their formation. As has already been remarked, popular Hinduism does not recognise converts, and no one can be a Hindu who has not been born such. But it is not necessary to subscribe to any particular form of faith or belief; all that is necessary in order that one may remain in the Hindu social pale is not to marry outside one's caste or sub- caste - a condition which admits of no exception. Certain rules regarding food, and drink must also be observed, though they are now frequently broken, especially in the large cities, without involving any serious penalty. It is likewise incumbent to have certain forms of ritual performed by priests on the occasion of birth, marriage, and death, and in the case of the highest castes, also on the occasion of assuming the sacred thread. Early Marriage. The practice of early marriage is largely prevalent among Hindus, and every effort is made, especially among the higher castes,</page><page sequence="8">June 4, код. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 589 to marry a girl before the age of' puberty. Taking the whole population in India, only one-third of the total number of females are unmarried, and of these three-quarters are under the age of ten, and seven-tenths of the remainder under fifteen. In India 78 per cent, of the females between 15 and 45 are married compared with 47 per cent, in England. Much is said of the woes of Hindu widows. But so far as the community at large is con- cerned the complaint is very much exagge- rated. It being a cardinal duty with a Hindu father to marry every one of his daughters, it stands to reason that he should object to the re-marriage of widows, which would reduce the number of eligible bridegrooms. Besides, the sufferings of a widow are perhaps no greater than those of a spinster, and the proportion of widows is no larger than that of spinsters in this country, the fact being that a considerable portion of women in every country must remain without the society of husbands, whether as widows or spinsters. Though it may be conceded that a widow, in India as elsewhere, has every right to re-marry, and that no obstacle should be thrown in her way, yet the question of the re-marriage of widows is of minor importance to the community, and there is a tendency to magnify individual cases of hardship. Position of Hindu Women. There exists a good deal of misconception regarding the position of women in India. It is asserted that they are immured within the walls of the zenana, where they spend their time in idleness and inanity. No picture could be further from the truth. The seclusion of women is foreign to Hindu traditions, and no trace of it can be found in early Sanskrit litera- ture ; on the contrary, there are numerous instances proving the absence of any such practice. The custom was no doubt intro- duced by the Mohammedans and spread during periods of anarchy and unsettled government ; it was always confined to the higher classes. As regards the masses constituting the bulk of the population, the women in most parts of India are as free as in Europe. Even among the better classes the zenana system is lax with the Hindus in Madras and Bombay ; but whether their movements are restricted or not, the Hindu ladies exercise an influence in family affairs which is far greater than is known here. The oldest lady in the family is looked up to with respect and veneration by all the mem- bers, both male and female, and nothing of any importance is done without consulting her or obtaining her consenÇ. If she happens to be a woman of strong character, as she not unfrequently. is, she exercises undisputed sway within her little world ; and such cases are within the knowledge of every Hindu. The ladies also lead active and useful lives. They usually do all the cooking, and are most in- dustrious in the management of their household affairs. They are devoted to children, but want of education stands in the way of their making full use of their opportunities, especially of looking after the upbringing of the little ones and exercising that healthy home influence over them which is such a bright feature in the best English families. Rkascendancy of Hinduism. Reference has already been made to the gradual growth of priestly supremacy and hardening of caste distinctions, and to efforts made by Buddhism to combat both. In the great religion which Gautama founded there is no room for Brahman s, for he preached the brotherhood of man ; but after several centuries of prosperity, Buddhism began to decline. The intellectual superiority of the Brahman finally asserted itself again, and Hinduism once more raised its head and existed side by side with Buddhism until in the eighth century a Brahman of marvellous intelligence - by name Sankaracharya - appeared, who in the course of a short life (he died at the age of32), dealt a death blow to Buddhism and effected the complete revival of Hinduism. It was not, however, the virile faith of the early Aryans, but a debased form of superstition which was indicative of national degradation ; and when later the victorious followers of Islam poured in from the West they found an enemy enervated by an unwholesome faith, and divided against itself by the most pernicious system of caste that the world had ever known. The political power of the Hindus crumbled to pieces, and the country fell an easy prey to the Mohammedan sword. Reforming Movements. Attempts in the same direction - viz., to break through caste and superstition - have been made from time to time from the early period of Mohammedan rule, the presence of a powerful religion that abhorred idolatry and recognised the equality of man, doubtless acting as a great incentive. Rámánuja, who belonged to Southern India and lived in the</page><page sequence="9">590 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. June 4, 1900. twelfth century, preached the unity of God, the only way to salvation, according to him, being love of God. A few generations later a follower of his- Rámánanda - inculcated the same noble doctrine in Northern India. Kabir, who was a disciple of Rámánanda, made it the great mission of his life to unite Hindus and Mohammedans. " The city of the Hindu God/' said he, "is in the east (Benares) ; the city of the Mohammedan God is in the west (Mecca), but search your hearts and there you will find the God of both Hindu and Moham- medan." Nának, who was born in the latter part of the fifteenth century, had a similar object in view, and almost contempo- raneous with him was Chaitanya, who in Bengal preached the gospel of divine love with conspicuous success. All these reformers agreed in discounting sacerdotal supremacy and abjuring caste, Among Chaitanya' s adherents were converts from Islam, who freely joined in their love- feasts. Chaitanya spent many years in Orissa and ended his life under the shadow of the temple at Puri, and it is an interesting fact that though caste is closely guarded through- out India, a considerable amount of laxity is to this day permitted within the precincts of the city of Jagganath, where a Brahman un- hesitatingly partakes of holy food from the hands of one much lower than himself, whose touch would be pollution outside of this sacred spot. Brahma Samaj and Arya Samaj. Coming to more recent times, the nineteenth century is marked by two notable movements striving for a purer faith. Bengal witnessed the birth of Brahmaism, which is theism pure- and simple, and is not to be confounded with Brahmanism ; and several years later the Arya Samaj appeared in the Punjab. Both these niovements are the outcome of the con- tact of the East and the West. The British supremacy in India began in Bengal with Clive' s victory at Plassey, in 1757, and before many decades were over, the effects of the study of English literature became manifest in unsettling the minds of the people, and shaking their faith in the religion of their ancestors, and at one time it appeared probable that the efforts of a band of able and zealous mission- aries would be crowned with success, and that Christianity would claim many high-class con- verts. It was at this juncture, when the minds of the Hindus were in a state of apprehension, that a man arose who was pre-eminent in thought, culture and attainments, and who turned the tide of unbelief towards an alto- gether different direction. This man was Raja Ram Mohan Ray. He was born in 1774, and early gave indications of great capacity. He was well versed in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, English, Hebrew, and other languages, and was at the outset inspired by a careful study of the Upanishads; and his first impulse was to revive the sublime doctrines of those writings. But he was also greatly in- fluenced by a study of the Koran and the Bible, and Brahmaism as founded by him, and as it has remained ever since, was an eclective faith, taking what was best in the other reli- gions, and freely borrowing from them. It has thus assimilated the severe mono- theism of the Koran, the fatherhood of God, and the brotherhood of man, and all the sublime morality that the Bible teaches, and the personal communion and spiritual elevation which are to be learnt from the Upanishads. On the other hand, it differs from all the other religions by refusing to accept any book as sacred in the sense of being a direct revelation from God, or to recog- nise any mediator or prophet through whom alone salvation is to be attained. Conscience, intuition, and divine inspiration as the result of intense communion with God are held to be the only guides in the path of religion. The founder of Brahmaism was not only a great religious reformer, but was also a pioneer in all social reforms, and he actively helped Lord William Bentinck in putting down suttee or the burning of widows and other evil prac- tices. I may remark in passing that the Raja was the first Indian of any note to cross the seas, for he came to England in 1831 and was present in the House of Commons when the debate on the first Reform Bill took place. His sad death in the following year was deeply mourned and his cremated remains lie buried in Stapleton-grove Cemetery, Bristol. The impulse given to social reform by the Raja has been well-sustained by his followers, who have always taken a lead- ing part in all social movements, such as abolition of caste and early marriage, promotion of re-marriage of widows, edu- cation of women and doing away with their seclusion, and the uplifting of the lower classes, besides taking a share in all philanthropic measures, such as famine relief, &amp;c. ; and it may be said that in proportion to their number the Brahmas have done much in</page><page sequence="10">J«neb i goo. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 591 all these respects. After the Raja the two great men who did most to spread Brahmaism were Debendranath Tagore, and Keshab Chandra Sen. The reception given to the latter when he visited England in 1870 must be within the recollection of some of us present here. Branches of the Brahma Samaj are now established in all parts of India, and its adherents number some of the most cultured and influential men. The Arya Samaj owes its origin to Daya- nand Sarasvati. It regards the Vedas as inspired and the only direct revelation from God, and aims at purging Hinduism of its accretions and restoring the simpler faith of ancient times. In common with Brahmaism, it discards caste and idolatry, permits the re- marriage of widows, allows conversion from other faiths, encourages adult marriage of both sexes, and fosters education, but it lacks -the eclectic character of Brahmaism, and its attitude towards other religions is not always friendly or tolerant. It has taken deep root in the Panjab, where it carries on an active and successful propaganda, and is rapidly extending in the neighbouring provinces, though elsewhere, e.g., in Madras, Bombay, and Bengal, it is yet practically unknown. Time will not permit me to refer to other movements each of which claims many fol- lowers, such as the ecstatic and fervid piety of Ramkrishna Paramhansa, vedantism of which Swami Vivekanand was such an able ex- ponent, and theosophy, which is the product of the Western mind upon an Eastern basis, and which has been eagerly adopted by those Hindus who were unwilling to break away from the orthodox fold, but were yet glad to find in the new cult some satisfaction for their higher cravings. People in this country hear only of political unrest and of its various manifestations. They take little heed of the great religious upheaval that has overtaken the Hindu world and of the various agencies that are at work for bringing about spiritual reform. From the earliest times the Hindu mind has been specially prone to religious emotions, and a Hindu above all is spiritual. His everyday life is mixed up with religion and his care is more for the next world than for this. Hinduism is pass- ing through a crisis which may well be de- scribed as severe, and it remains to be seen how far its powers of adaptation and assimi- lation, which have stood in such good stead in tthe past, will come again to its help, and in -what form it will ultimately emerge. Evils of the Caste System. The greatest bulwark of Hinduism is caste, and the various castes have been kept intact by restrictions of food and marriage. It is a matter for common observation that the restrictions of food are being gradually re- laxed, so much so, that in the large cities like Calcutta, they have nearly lost all their force. I remember the time »when a breach of the sumptuary rules entailed the severest penalties, including social ostracism. But we have now the satisfaction of witnessing the practical disappearance of the old dis- abilities. Railways and steamers have come in to the aid of English education in relaxing the restrictions on food, and men who have been on a visit to foreign countries are re- admitted to caste with or without purificatory ceremonies. I am aware that among the masses, and even among the educated classes in some parts of the country, the caste rules are still strictly observed. But a great and perceptible breach has been made, and it is daily widening ; the future is thus full of hope. The rules regarding endogamy are, how- ever, strictly observed, except among those like the Brahmas and Arya Samaj ists, who openly encourage intermarriage ; but even among the orthodox people something in the same direction is being done, by permitting marriages between subdivisions of the same caste. Of all the evils that afflict Hindu society, the caste system is one of the worst. In the pecu- liar circumstances of the settlement and deve- lopment of the Aryans in India, tlie growth of the caste system was perhaps inevitable. It may have had its uses at one time in making each caste particularly zealous in maintaining its own pre-eminence, and thus prompting a Brahman to excel in learning, a kishetrya in warfare, and a vaisya in his particular craft. But there can be no doubt that the rigid form which it ultimately assumed, and in which it has continued for centuries, has done much to stifle the healthy growth of the nation, and instead of making for unity and cohesion, has fomented dissensions among the various classes, fostered pride and arrogance on the one side and sepvility and resentment oh the other, raised difficulties in the way of free social intercourse, thrown obstacles in the path of travel, caused physical deterioration, and been one of the main factors of the de- generation of a once great race. Admitting that in past times the system served some useful purpose- there is no denying the fact</page><page sequence="11">59 2 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. June 4,1909. that at present it has not a single redeeming feature - and if the Hindu is again to lift his head and take part in the great work of nation building, he must revert to his original Aryan type and demolish the barriers that divide the community. Education is no longer the monopoly of the privileged few, and the learned professions are now ppen to all classes. The great masses are beginning to pulsate with the common pride of humanity, and refuse to accept the doctrine that birth and not capacity should decide one's status and rank. But instead of boldly disowning caste, the depressed classes at times strive for a higher position in the social framework by trying to prove their supposed identity with some recognised superior caste. Such attempts only lead to collision with other classes and intensify existing estrangements without bringing any corresponding advantage to their authors. Evils of Early Marriage. Another canker which eats into the vitals of Hindu society is early marriage. It is diffi- cult to trace the origin of this pernicious custom, for the Aryan settlers certainly did not practise it. In the Rigveda the god of marriage is entreated to "go to some other maiden who is still in her father's house and has attained the signs 0f.the3.ge of marriagè," and again to " go to an unmarried maiden whose person is well developed." Even much later, Kalidasa, the Hindu Shakespeare, who flourished in the sixth century after Christ, describes the heroine of his immortal drama "Sakuntala" as having attained the bloom of her youthful loveliness, when she meets her lover. ' ' Svayambara, ' ' the choice by a princess of a husband from several suitors in open assembly, was a recognised custom in royal houses. The practice of early marriage was of slow growth, beginning perhaps with the natural anxiety of a comparatively small com- munity of strangers fighting their way against powerful enemies, and in urgent need of popu- lation to open up the country to have children as early as possible ; and later, when troublous times came, parents were doubtless anxious to provide their daughters with partners who would also be their protectors as soon as prac- ticable. But whatever the reason, the un- natural custom has become universal among the higher classes. Its evil effects upon the community are but too apparent. It has been the main factor in the physical deterioration of the race and in stunting the growth and de- velopment of individuals of both sexes. Girls who should be in the playground or at school are carried off to lead unhealthy lives in seclu- sion and undertake the responsibilites of a mother when they are yet unable to take care of themselves. Education in the proper sense of the word is thus impossible for girls belong- ing to orthodox families, as they have to leave school before they have had time to acquire the rudiments of learning. The young man is no less handicapped. He becomes burdened with the cares of a family before he has finished his education. He is not free to go about and seek a suitable career but must accept anything that may come in his way to meet his immediate necessities. But the worst effects fall upon the issue of such child-marriages, and they come to this World weighted among other disadvantages with an enfeebled constitution. The sufferings of child - widows are well known. They, along with widows of maturer years, are subjected to hardships and disa- bilities, which makes their budding lives miser- able ; but there could not be child- widows if there were no ehild-marriages. The stoppage of child-marriage would at once make child- widows impossible. It is a hopeful sign that the people are beginning to realise the evils of this unnatural custom, and the difficulty of securing eligible bridegrooms is raising the marrying age of girls. The young men are learning to resist the importunities of their parents for early wedlock. Progress so far has been slow, but there is hope of acceleration as time proceeds. Conclusion. A deep esoteric meaning is claimed for every symbol of image-worship ; and expounders and apologists have not been wanting who have tried to lift the veil and give a glimpse of the underlying spirituality. Skilful and deft hands have woven many a charming and plausible tale round what, to ordinary minds, appears only commonplace. But those who are behind the scenes know only too well how the sub- stance has been forgotten in the form, and how the overgrown husk has taken the place of the kernel. Ever since the advent of the Aryans, upwards of 4,000 years ago, India has been the land of religion. Of the four greatest faiths that the world has known India has been the birth- place of two. From earliest times and long before the dawn of civilisation in the West, the best intellects of India have striven to un-</page><page sequence="12">June 4, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 593 ravel the mystery of. life, to distinguish between mind and matter, and to solve the problem of the future state. In their achievements in the domain of philosophy they anticipated the loftiest conceptions of European thinkers. No higher or purer ideal of the Supreme Being has ever been inculcated than in the Upani- shads, and some of the most sublime truths that the world has ever known, are to be found in the immortal Gita. The Aryan sages have shown that by intense subjec- tive concentration they are able to perform deeds which, to the uninitiated, appear to be supernatural. In their earnest endeavour to prepare for the hereafter they have shown the greatest contempt for things mundane, and spiritual eminence has always been honoured beyond anything else. Regard for truth and honour was at one time so great that the hero of one of the two great epics went into long voluntary exile in order to satisfy a gambling debt, and that of the other gave up the throne and repaired to the forest in order to enable his father to keep his vow. The laws of war were marked by a humanity which is unknown in any other country. The descendants of such a spiritual race cannot drift into scepticism or irreligion, and it is to be hoped that the un- settling of beliefs caused by contact with the West will only be temporary, and that in future the religion of the Hindus will be purged of all superstitious excrescences, and contain not only what is best in their own ancient faith, but also such precious gifts as the other noble creeds have to offer, and that exclusiveness will give place to a wider sympathy and a truer recog- nition of the brotherhood of man. DISCUSSION. The Chairman (Sir George Bird wood) said his observations on Mr. Gupta's lecture, with which he found himself in almost complete agreement, should not be discoursive but discursive. It was the tradi- tional duty of the Chairman on such occasions to make something of a set speech by way of encouraging others to take part in the discussions on the papeis read ; but there was very little room for any formal criticism of Mr. Gupta's admirably methodised, and loftily inspired, and eloquently expressed discourse, and as he wished to invite Sir Arundel Arundel and Sir Steuart Ba)ley respectively to move and second the vote of thanks to Mr. Krishna Govinda Gupta, he desired, at that late hour, to stand as little in their way as possible, and '&amp; ould confine his re- marks on the paper for the most part to a few supple- mentary statements. The word hindu meant, among the Iranian Aryas, liver; and their geographi- cal denomination Hapta - Hindu, "seven rivers " country, referred to the region about Herat, with its actual or imputed " sacred seven " rivers. Among the Indian Aryas, who invented the Sanskrit, i.e. ''Per- fected" Indo-European language, the letter "h" changing to 4&lt; s," they spoke of " the Sapta-Sindhu," referring this form of the denomination to the noiťb- western marches of India, where the Sanskrit word for " river" yet survives in the name of the pro- vince oř Sind; and the Indus, and "five" rivers of the Punjab [" Five- waters "] and the mystic Saras- vati, make up the "sacred seven" of this ]n4o- European 4&lt; Sapta-Sindhu." The form Hidliu , re- ferring to India, occurs on the tomb of Darius Hystaspes at Persepolis, and the foim Hodu , also meaning India, in the 4 'Book of Esther" I. 1, and viii. 9. The modern Persians continue to use the form Hindu for the people of India, and Hindu- stan for India, meaning northern India especially : and the Muslims have universally followed their locution. The Greeks dropped the aspirate, and the Latins, and modern Europeans, adopting their spelling always speak of the ** Indus," and "India:" and we apply the latter term to all India from the Himala&gt; a to Cape Comorin ; call- ing Southern India the Deccan, or the Carnatic, and inclining to restrict the term Hindustan to North- ern India. The correct name for India among the educated Hindus is Bharata ; and among the Budd- hists [Jainas, &amp;c.] Jambudvipa [4&lt; the Myrtle- tree (Sizygium Jambolanum)-land "]. Buddhism was internationalised, humanised, Hinduism, the result of the great commerce that began to spring up about 1000 B.C. between India and Assyria and Baby- lonia and Egypt ; and undoubtedly it was the Greeks who inspired the Buddhists with the impulse to re- present the Buddha, and the minor Buddhistic saints, in pictorial, and particularly graven imagery ; and it is no more idolatry in any obnoxious sense than express- ing the Godhead, and His powers, in literal or nominal portraiture and personation. The Arab arch, as be had repeatedly tbeie Said, was obviously sug- gested by the line over the head and the shoulders of the seated statue of Buddha in the niche wherein it 1vas enshrined. He had great doubts of the racial purity of the Brahmans of Bengal and Southern India ; or any- where outside Western India, and the limits of iiArya varta " in Hindustan ; and he strongly suspected that the Brahmans, of Guzerat, and about Ratnagheii in the Southern Concan, and the Jainas of Guzerat, and elsewhere, and the Rajputs, represent the purest Aryan " colour " [varna'] or caste, now left in India ; and was inclined to hold the Guzerat Brahmans to be the " bluest blood " of them all. He could not accept the opinion that the success of the Muslim con- querors of Hindustan was due to the idolatry of the Hindus ; in his opinion it was due to the absurd rivalries of the Rajput pi inces among themselves, and their sporting delight [after the manner of true Englishmen] in neglecting to prepare properly for war,</page><page sequence="13">5&lt;н JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. June 4f i9og. and then having a desperate uphill fight for victory - or defeat !* He felt, indeed, that throughout his paper, the learned and able author carried his condemnation of idolatry a little too far. It was not their religion that degraded people, but people who degraded their religion ; just as it is not ale and wine that disgrace men, but the silly men, who disgrace wine and ale. In regard to caste, - for all its evils,- if abolished, India would be once again reduced to chaos ; and would never be able to support her un- employed, and pension off her poor at seventy ! In regard to its social tyrannies, to this day - anyhow to his day, 1854-70 - no Muslim might ride on horseback in some of the Hindu Native States of "Western India. The author had said nothing of the tenets of Hinduism, and rightly ; but the belief in transmigration was very widely spread among all classes of Hindus, and with the most salutary results ; and as it was a belief that could be largely justified by some of the current tentative theories of scientists, he would have been interested in hearing Mr. Gupta's views on the subject. Devout Hindus had a strong sense of its reality. Like the Earl of Buchan, Walter Scott's " Prince of Bores,'' although he was by no means a bore to ordinary people, quite ingenuously, habitually identified himself with his forefathers, saying such things as : - " Well, when / was with George I. one day, &amp;c." " When they were considering the execution of Charles I., / raised the strongest objection to it." For police purposes, the Chair- man continued, the tenet is to be strongly recom- mended. When I was riding up Matheran Hill some fifty years ago on a miserable tattoo [pony], it broke down when one-third up the hill, with only an hour to abrupt nightfall. I was at my wit's end what to do, when there came riding * The Hindu princes, through the whole thousand years anterior to the re-vindication of Aryan supremacy, under the aegis of the Honourable East India Companj', in India, were also liable to suffer greatly, especially in their conflicts with the Muslims, from the " peace at any price " counsels of any Brahmanical minister, who happened to gain an undue ascendancy over them ; as is in one instance pertinently em- phasised in the history of Hindu art. A Hindu prince of Southern India had always been most successful in repelling the predatory attacks of his neighbours ; but yielding, in his old age, to the advice of a pious Brahman, he disbanded his troops of all arms, substituting for them an equally nume- rous army of bronze figurines, which he was told would be just as successful against his enemies, and without any shedding of blood. The inevitable end came in his speedy subjugation, with more bloodshed than ever, and the scattering of his Lilliputian infantry, cavalry, foot artillery, horse artillery, camelry, and elephantry throughout India, where these inimitable little bronzes, perfect in their artistic mimicry of the whole gamut of military swagger in man and beast, are the most delightful prizes the European and American lovers of such treasures may to this very day chance upon in some unexpected European "godown," or remote bazaar. I have illustrated several of them in my "Industrial Arts of India," published by the Science and Art Department, and a few of them were happily acquired for the Victoria and Albert Museum (not Bombay), South Kensington. - G. B. down the hill a wealthy Settia of Bombay, pre- viously personally unknown to me, superbly mounted, with two or three runners with him. I had to act quickly, and I stopped and respectfully saluted him, appealing to him : - " Settjee Sahib % do swop horses ? " Dumbfounded by the highwayman -like supplication, he cried out : - " What ? Why ?" I replied " Because yours is a good horse and mine a bad one ; mine has two-thirds of the journey yet to do, and all up hill ; yours has only the last third of your jouiney to do, and all down hill ; and if you take my horse you will be taking it home, and if you give me your horse I shall be taking it home ! You will not be inconvenienced, and I shall be greatly con veni enced." He stood unmoved, and then I added: - "In the new birth what will be your doom if this tattoo on reaching my door drops dead ? " Before I could well finish my sentence he was off his horse, and assisting me up on it. I am happy to add, in extenuation of my youthful villainy that this was the beginning of a life-long friendship, and that before many years had passed I was able to render this " friend in need " some great personal services. I could tell several similar stories of the salutary influences of a faith in transmigration, stories in which it was not I who was, as here, " the villain of the piece." The climax of feeling, thought, and expression is reached in the concluding paragraph, of Mr. Gupta's paper, and the difficulty is to dwell on it without being too deeply moved, and I will, there- fore, express my own convictions and conclusions on the supreme problems of human nature to which it refers by quoting, or rather rendering from memory, the passage in " The Confessions of St. Augustine," where describing the moving scene of his mother cushioned up on her reading couch by the window at Ostia, overlooking the bright red, white, and yellow flowered garden below, with the blue floor of the Mediterranean stretching southward to Carthage, serenely awaiting her near death, and communing sweetly with her sainted son on the things that were past and those that were to come, until by degrees their thoughts travelled beyond the bounds of this world, even into the very heaven of heavens, and beyond their own individualities into the universal " Self-Sense," that is the life of all that is, and was, and shall be, the Eternal Wisdom, he adds : - " When the tumult of the heart is hushed, and hushed all images of earth, and sea, and air, and all the dreams of imaginary revelations, and all symbols, thoughts, and whatever else exists only in transition, and we are awake only in Him that abideth everlastingly, the Word that called all things out of nothing,- Is not this to enter into the joy of thy Maker ?" It is in such passages, to be found in so many of the writings of the Christian Fathers, and of the Greek and Latin philosophers and moralists, of the Hindu sages and religious revivalists, of the Muslim metaphysicians and theologians, and above all, in the Upanishads [" Upper" or " Superior teachings," or the esoteric doctrines of the Brah-</page><page sequence="14">SW4, 190Q. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 595 mana, or ceremonial and ritualistic rubrics of the Vedas] of the Hindus, referred to by Mr. Krishna Govinda Gupta, - it is here that we find the synthesis of all religions in the common Father- hood of God, and brotherhood of man, and learn that they are all equally partial and transient in their creeds, dogmas, rituals, mythologies, tenets, and even precepts, and all equally determinate and enduring in the spiritual realities, their doctrines, disciplines, ceremonies, and other means of grace, connote, and more or less imperfectly adumbrate. It is as well for our own serenity not to delay realising this until there arises from our hearts the bitter cry wrung from St. Augustine's - " Sero Te amavi." It is from this stand- point that I regard Hinduism, Puranic, and Vedic equally, and have always advised every Hindu, de- voted to his family, and his ancestral religion, - in the saying of Lady Jane Scott: - "Haud ye fast to the past, '- so long as it holds to you; or, in the words of Pope : - " Be not the first by whom the new is tried, Nor yet the last to lay the old aside." There is no salvation outside that rule for the great, and spiritually, and intellectually and aesthetically truly glorious, historical race of Brahmanical Hindus. Sir Arundel Arundel, K.C.S.I., in proposing a vote of thanks to the author for his admirable, interesting and comprehensive paper, said that he wished cordially to re-echo the sentiments of ap- preciation which the Chairman had expressed concerning Mr. Gupta and his promotion to the high office which he held as Member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. Mr. Gupta had a distinguished career in the Civil Service, and he had now been promoted to a still more distinguished position. He had no doubt Mr. Gupta would be the forerunner of many wise advisers in that council who would aid in making the government of India better and more contented. He (Sir Arundel) had been fortunate in that during the last three or four months of his residence in India he was chairman of a committee which Lord Minto appointed out of his council to consider the sub- ject of reforms. In that committee the ideas and proposals which Lord Minto brought forward were considered ; and he thought those present might congratulate themselves that Mr. Gupta was one of the first fruits of the reforms which had recently been carried out by Lord Minto and Lord Morley. The Chairman said it was very puzzling to know why Buddhism had vanished out of India after its marvellous career of about a thousand years. He would like to mention a local legend in a part of India where he was resident. It was that a dispute arose as to which was the true religion, the Hindu or the Buddhist ; and it was decided that the sacred Books of both religions should be floated in the river, and that whichever went up- stream should be considered the right religion, and the one that went down-stream the wrong one, and that the professors of the wrong religion were to be exterminated. The experiment was made, when, it was said, the Brahminical books went up-stream, and the others down - stream, and, therefore, the Buddhist priests were exterminated, and so that little theological difficulty was settled. For many years before he left India there were constant complaints amongst Hindus that the respect for parents was diminishing, that the young men, educated in the universities, were losing reverence for their religion, which was being disintegrated, and that they had practically no guide in its place. About two years ago, a number of enlightened Hindu gentlemen of means, who felt the drawbacks which Mr. Gupta mentioned, determined, under the guidance of Mrs. Besant, that they would form a Hindu College at Benares, where they would endeavour, by proper and sound teaching, to bring the boys and young men who fell under their influence into a better frame of mind, morally, intellectually, and religiously. It might be surprising to many, as it was to him, to find that the Hindu religion was there being systematically taught. He had the elementary and advanced text- books, and they showed the great difference there was between the young men of India and those of this country, for the latter, unless they showed an unique tendency towards metaphysics, would not be able to under- tand the subject. Sir Steijart Colvin Bayley, K.C.S.I., C.I.E , in seconding the vote of thanks, which he had to do very briefly on account of having to leave immediately, said it gave him especial pleasure to do so as he had the honour of being a collaborator with the author in the Govern-' ment of Bengal. He would have much liked to discuss some portions of the paper, but even if he had not to leave it would have been too late. But he agreed in the main with all it contained, and he expressed his appreciation of the opportunity of seconding the vote of thanks. Mr. R. A. L. Moore said the author remarked that out of the 294 millions of people in India, about 207 millions were Hindus, and he would like to know whether in that figure was included the millions of outcasts, the so-called untouchable classes, such as the pariahs. Among the Western hill-tribes there were some strànge gods which he scarcely thought the orthodox Hindu would recognise, such as the tiger god, and1 the lady who was the goddess of the stomach-ache, which trouble she was supposed tö be able to cure. The vote of thanks was carried unanimously. Mr. Gupta thanked the meeting for il s indulgent appreciation of his paper. What Sir Arundel Arundel said about the college at Benares was a supplement to his own remarks on the subject. One knew the great</page><page sequence="15">596 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS June 4, i9oq. value of the work which that college was doing. He was not able off-hand to give the numbers of the different persuasions, but he did not include in the 207,000,000 pf Hindus the people many of whom went under the heading of animists ; these were six or seven millions, and they were separate from Hindus. It would be difficult for anybody to try to differentiate between the different classes which came under the name Hindu, but they all recognised certain things which were common in Hinduism, and lhe mere fact that one class was not touched by another did not necessarily exclude it from the pale of Hinduism ; they observed certain forms, and worshipped certain gods. He did not say that all the animistic gods had been absorbed in Hinduism, but that it was a pro- cess which was going on. Some of the gods included in the Hindu Pantheon came from aboriginal sources. He did not doubt that in course of time others would be swept in.</page></plain_text>
