<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADAM'S WOMB (AUGUSTINE, CONFESSIONS 13.28) AND THE SALTY SEA a quo [sc. Deo] si non esset lapsus Adam , non dijfunderetur ex utero eius salsugo maris , genus humanum profunde curiosum et procellose tumidum et instabilite r fluidum1 This paper begins with a puzzle, a passage of Confessions 13 which has left commentators baffled. How can Adam have a uterus? Gibb and Montgomery, in 1927, gave the problem a name; O'Donnell, in 1992, opted for citing their comment with a quiet gloss of his own utero G-M (understatement): 'A remarkable example of catachresis. It is to be explained, no doubt, by the fact that "Adam" is used generically rather than personally.'2 'Catachresis' is a grammarian's term for extended or transferred use of language. Cicero explains it in the Orator : translata [sc. verba] dico, ut saepe iam, quae per similitudinem ab alia re aut suavitatis aut inopiae causa transferuntur; immutata, in quibus pro verbo proprio subicitur aliud quod idem significet sumptum ex re aliqua consequenti. quod quamquam transferendo fit, tarnen alio modo transtulit cum dixit Ennius 'arce et urbe orba sum', alio modo [si pro patria arcem dixisset, et] 'horridam Africam terribili tremere tumultu' [cum dicit pro Afris immutate Africam]: hanc hypallagen rhetores, quia quasi summutantur verba pro verbis, metonymian grammatici vocant, quod nomina transferuntur; Aristoteles autem translationi et haec ipsa subiungit et abusionem, quam catachresin vocat, ut cum minutum dicimus animum pro parvo; et abutimur verbis propinquis, si opus est vel quod delectat vel quod decet. iam cum fluxerunt continuo plures translationes, alia plane fit oratio; itaque genus hoc Graeci appellant allegorian : nomine recte, genere melius ille qui ista omnia translationes vocat.3 Quintilian adds a further distinction: abusio est ubi nomen defuit, tralatio ubi aliud fuit; nam poetae soient abusive etiam in iis rebus quibus nomina sua sunt vicinis potius uti, quod rarum in prosa est.4</page><page sequence="2">90 E. G. CLARK Neither suggests that catachresis , or its Latin equivalent abusio, implies abuse of language: it is one form of metaphor. One obvious use for catachresis in Quintilian's sense is in theology, when people try to express a partial understanding of God for which there are no words.5 But Augustine is talking about Adam, and in prose, and there was no lack of words to describe the origin of the human race. The use of the term 'catachresis' is not itself the problem, but it helpfully labels the problem: can Augustine's language here be satisfactorily explained in Cicero's terms as abutimur verbis propinquis, si opus est vel quod delectat vel quod decetl Why is he saying it like this? Augustine presents Adam as having a uterus, from which flows the salt sea-water which is the turbulent human race. This is disconcerting chiefly because people think of Adam as male, and of the uterus as the womb, which is a defining characteristic of femaleness. It is also disconcerting to think of the human race as fluid shed from the uterus; waters break before a birth, but the offspring itself represented as fluid suggests, if anything, miscarriage. A fourth-century audience might have been less immediately disconcerted by a reference to Adam's uterus, uterus is now a technical word for 'womb', but Latin does not have a word which means always and only 'womb'.6 uterus , like Greek gastēr , could also mean 'belly', the abdominal cavity in general. That is its meaning consistently in the first-century medical writer Celsus, who uses vulva for 'womb' ; but vulva is also used as a general term for the female genitalia.7 Jurists standardly used venter (again like gastēr) for the pregnant womb. Fourth-century medical writers, including Augustine's friend Vindicianus, kept the phrase in utero , but preferred matrix for 'womb'; and matrix , which had earlier meant 'a breeding animal', is the only word for 'womb' used in Latin versions of Oribasius (physician to the emperor Julian), who collected his material from a range of medical texts. But Augustine's choice of words is affected not only by colloquial, technical or literary Latin, but by the Latin Bible, and this is an even more complicated matter. The various pre- Vulgate Latin versions of the Bible, known collectively as the Vetus Latina , have to be reconstructed from citations in authors who may well not have verified their references, or who, like Augustine, adapt citations and merge them with their own language.8 These versions may reflect Latin usage over at least two centuries, but they also reflect the concern of their authors to convey as closely as possible the sense of the Greek text from which they were working, and that sense included variations of language.9 Where the Greek text had mētra the Vetus Latina probably had vulva' where the Greek had gastēr or koilia the Vetus Latina had uterus.10 The balance alters in the Vulgate OT, which makes more extensive use of uterus than of vulva , and has matrix only in Fourth Esdras; but this too is complicated.11 Jerome worked from Hebrew texts, but tried to respect the traditional versions based on the Greek text; he held that Bible translation should use the language spoken by ordinary people, not that of the literary élite; he was sometimes literal, but he also liked to vary words where the Hebrew repeats a word, and he was not worried about consistency.</page><page sequence="3">ADAM' S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 9 1 One distinguished scholar concludes that whatever he said about it, he 'translated very much as he happened himself to feel at any particular moment'.12 Despite these complexities, Augustine's preference is quite clear. He hardly ever uses matrix , and then not literally of the womb. He uses vulva in a few Biblical citations and discussions of these. There is one other notable use of vulva in his work, but here the sense 'womb' may not predominate. Augustine is writing against Vincentius Victor, who had argued that the soul is corporeal and even conformed to the shape of the body, but nevertheless is the likeness of a body, not actually a body: does it then, Augustine asks, have sexual characteristics? sed tarnen si secundum tuam opinionem et corpus est anima et vivum corpus est et habet mammas protumidas et propendulas et non habet barbam et habet vulvam et genitalia, quae habent feminae corporis membra, et non est femina ... 13 But Augustine's preferred word for 'womb' is uterus. 14 He uses it not only in Biblical citation, but also when discussing the virginal conception of Jesus; in metaphors; and simply as the word for 'womb', for instance when he refers to the birth of twins as a counter-example for astrology. Augustine, then, did mean Adam's womb, and that must have been startling. But perhaps it should not be: perhaps it is a theological or linguistic mistake to think of Adam as male. Gibb and Montgomery suggested, reasonably enough, that Augustine is using 'Adam' generically, that is, as the name of the first, representative, human being, not of the first specifically male human. In City of God, about twenty years after the Confessions , Augustine says 'masculum et feminam fecit illos et benedixit illos et cognominavit nomen illorum Adam' , unde non ambigitur sic appellatam fuisse feminam Evam proprio nomine, ut tarnen Adam, quod interpretatur homo, nomen esset amborum.15 Eve herself, he says in another passage, was made not as Adam was, but from Adam, so that this one human being should be the source of all the human race: quando ne ipsam quidem feminam copulandam viro sicut ipsum creare illi placuit, sed ex ipso, ut omnino ex homine uno diffunderetur genus humanum.16 Augustine made increasing use of the idea, derived from Paul, that all human beings not only are children of Adam but were present in Adam, thereby sharing in sin and death.17 He used it especially in his first response to Simplicianus, which he finished in 396, the year before he began (and, as many scholars think, completed) the Confessions .18 Ambrose had a neatly phrased version, which Augustine sometimes borrowed, in his commentary on Luke: fuit enimAdam et in ilio fuimus omnes ; peccavit Adam et in ilio omnes peccaverunt.]9 Sin, Augustine added, is like gout, which people</page><page sequence="4">92 E. G. CLARK acquire in their ancestors.20 In Confessions 10, Augustine observes that happiness, the beata vita , is a concept that makes sense to human beings: in his terms, they have it in their memory, as part of their mental furniture. Have they therefore experienced the beata vita , whether individually or in ilio homine qui primus peccavit , in quo et omnes mortui sumus et de quo omnes cum miseria nati sumus ?21 But being 'born from the first human', or even 'born from Adam', is not as discon- certing as being born from Adam's womb. A generic human can be described only by omitting all reference to sexual characteristics. Ambrose manages a non-specific description in his Hexaemeron , when he expounds the glories of God's creation. There is a tense moment when he asks 'What shall I say of the genitals, which from the veins in the region of the neck, through the kidneys and loins, receive the generating seed designed for the function and satisfaction of procreation?'22 But the question is rhetorical: he continues 'What of the duty of the feet?', and it becomes clear that his interest is in veins, not in reproduction. Even 'seed' in his account is not decisive for maleness, because some medical writers, including Galen, thought that women also produce seed.23 They saw a structural similarity in male and female reproductive systems, testes corresponding to ovaries, Fallopian tubes to vasa deferentia , uterus to penis. But there is an insuperable difference: the male system goes outward, the female inward, and on this Ambrose does not commit himself. So Adam's womb confronts the reader with a question about the sex of the first human. This may sound like a problem which would occur only to a twentieth-century feminist, but it was there in the fourth century, and Augustine was not the only one who tried to deal with it. Basil of Caesarea thought a woman might complain that Genesis 1.27 is irrelevant to her, because anthrõpos has a masculine article. This does not mean, he says, that God made only male humans, for Scripture immediately rules out this possibility by adding 'male and female He created them'.24 Quite how many people heard ho anthrõpos as masculine is another question: perhaps, like most present-day women students learning Greek or Latin, they did not notice that the prevailing word-forms are masculine. In City of God Augustine discusses the chastity of rape victims, with special reference to the Gothic sack of Rome in 411, and uses masculine word-forms to discuss what appears to be a specifically feminine problem. But this may be because he wants to focus attention on the moral problem, not on the physical experience; his language is indirect, full of passives and periphrases.25 Anthrõpos and homo can be used genetically, but in practice Greek and Latin authors assume that they mean the normative, i.e. male, human being. (Augustine does also comment that Scripture can use vir to mean homo , as in beatus vir qui timet Dominum , since women who fear the Lord are also blessed.)26 The Graeco-Roman cultural assumption that the male is normative was reinforced by the second creation- narrative in Genesis (2.18-25). Here Adam has no partner, so God puts him to sleep and forms Eve from his rib. Modern feminist exegesis argues that the masculine language is misleading: the original adam , created male and female (Genesis 1.27), cannot be classified as male or as female, and Genesis 2 is a different, overtly</page><page sequence="5">ADAM'S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 93 patriarchal version of the creation-story, in which Eve is made from and for Adam. Fourth-century exegesis, whether of Plato or of Genesis, worked to resolve apparent contradictions in the sacred text. So Genesis 2 was read as a fuller exposition of the brief statement in 1.27, or, as Augustine put it in his Literal interpretation of Genesis, as the unfolding in time of God's timeless act of creation. Adam, then, was taken to be the primary, representative, generic human being, a male in whom the female was implicit. It was difficult to decide whether creation as male and female implies bodies from the outset, or whether there could be a spiritual distinction which was later given physical expression.27 Does a generic human being have a uterus, because femaleness is implicit in it? In Literal interpretation Augustine ruled out the suggestion that there was one human being with the characteristics of both sexes: rursus ne quisquam arbitraretur ita factum, ut in hornině singulari uterque sexus exprimeretur, sicut interdum nascuntur, quos androgynos vocant, ostendit se singulárem numerum propter coniunctionis unitatem posuisse et quod de viro mulier facta est, sicut postea manifestabitur, cum id, quod hie breviter dictum est, diligentius coeperit explicari; et ideo plurálem numerum continuo subiecit dicens: fecit eos et benedixit eos.28 Julian of Eclanum later claimed (or so Augustine said) that Augustine had forgotten this point, indeed that Augustine could not count: he had said, more dramatically than Ambrose, omnes ille unus fuerunt, whereas Adam and Eve were two. But ideo dixi 'omnes ille unus fuerunt' quia et illi duo, masculus et femina, non iam duo erant, sed una caro, et ego de omnibus genitis dixi, quoniam, quando peccatum est, omnes ille unus fuerunt; nondum quippe inde fuerat ullus in matrem seminatione transfusus, et utique filii a viris transfunduntur in feminas.29 So at the time of sin there was one living creature, one flesh, male and female as yet undivided by their awareness of each other as sexual beings; all people were that one, masculine, being, for no child had yet been begotten. Again, the reply to Julian is much later than the Confessions , and Augustine had gone on thinking and responding to questions.30 But Augustine's phrasing in reply to Julian raises a question which applies also to Confessions 13: why, when the human race appears, does it come from Adam's womb, and not from Adam's seed? The reference to Adam' s uterus is odd enough in terms of general assumptions about Adam. It is even odder in terms of Augustine's own anthropology (in the technical theological sense: his account of what it is to be human). Julian had asked his question about omnes ille unus fuerunt because he thought that Augustine put the blame for sin upon Adam, and after Adam on men - that is, males. In human sexual reproduction, a child cannot be conceived unless its father is temporarily overcome by desire in orgasm. Augustine, notoriously, came to the conclusion that sin is sexually transmitted</page><page sequence="6">94 E. G. CLARK in vitiated seed, which has been infected by the concupiscence, the desire to dominate and possess, of the parents.31 The evil of lust, he argued, is still present even when procreation within marriage makes a good use of lust, and even though the desire for marriage, concupiscentia nuptiarum , is not itself sinful.32 As Julian pointed out, this theory puts most of the blame on the man. Augustine could have accepted the opinions, still current in fourth-century medical thought, that females also produce seed in a kind of ejaculation triggered by desire,33 or that they do not conceive unless they also experience desire,34 but he does not say so; the most he does is to allude to the 'contagion' and 'contamination' of the womb and the process of birth, leaving it unclear whether he means the general messiness or some kind of sexual pollution. (Probably he would have agreed with Porphyry that human birth is an unclean experience, full of blood and bile and things even more inappropriate.)35 In his Unfinished work against Julian he explicitly interprets Romans 5.12, 'sin entered the world through one man' , to mean that sin entered precisely through male semen, which is the motive force of generation: ideo dixit [Paulus] 'per unum' quia sicut humani exemplum peccati coepit a femina, sic generado coepit a viro; conceptionem quippe, quae ad feminam pertinet, seminatio, quae ad virum pertinent, nullo dubitante praecedit.36 That was written twenty years after the Confessions , and Augustine had been checking up on medical theory, but there is no reason to think he had not previously shared the general belief that the male initiates reproduction. The human race, then, might be expected to pour not from the uterus but from the loins of Adam, as contaminated seminal fluid. Another passage of the Unfinished work against Julian makes the point, invoking a Scriptural reference to the tribe of Levi in the loins of Abraham: 'omnes ille unus fuerunt' quos fuerat seminatus, id est generaturus Adam; ex ilio ergo uno principaliter erant tracturi nascentes originale peccatum, qui genuit; ilia autem, qua coniuncta duo fuerunt, quod excepit concepit peperitque posterior, quamvis peccaverit prior, unde et sancta scriptura in lumbis patris Abraham dicit fuisse filios Levi.37 Modern interpreters of the Confessions reach for this image. Chadwick' s admirable translation renders uterus in 13.28 as 'loins', where others smooth over the problem: Pine-Coffin and Sheed have 'from him', and Labriolle 'de son sein'. Bonner explains Augustine's belief that 'the whole of humanity was seminally present in Adam's loins at the time of the Fall'.38 But Augustine was extremely sensitive to the choice and the associations of words. He uses uterus to mean 'womb'; he juxtaposes this specifically female organ with the name of a representative human who, when the question arises, is male; and the juxtaposition forces the question on the reader's notice. The argument</page><page sequence="7">ADAM'S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 95 of Gibb and Montgomery suggests that if Adam is a generic human, that human has female just as much as male characteristics. A reference to Adam's womb would, then, be analogous to the modern tactic of calling God 'she' on the grounds that 'she' is just as appropriate as 'he' (since God is not constrained by gender), or of referring to readers as 'she' on the grounds that women are half the human race. But the choice of 'she' is not indifferent: it is provocation and reminder, because people are familiar with the generic, i.e. unspecific, use of 'he'. Augustine rejects the interpretation that Adam is androgyne. What, then, is his purpose in forcing upon the reader's awareness the womb of Adam? 2 Augustine would not believe that Scripture said things which meant nothing in particular; even omissions require comment, quid igiturdicam, lumen meum , Veritas? quia vacat hoc , quia inanité r ita dictum est?39 The rest of this paper relies on the assumption that Augustine too does not use words inaniter. It seeks to interpret the words and imagery of one brief and puzzling text from Confessions by using Augustine's own exegetical technique, that is, by relating them to the words and imagery of Scripture and his own explorations of Scripture. If Adam had not fallen, Augustine says, the human race non dijfunderetur ex utero eius. Like other Latin writers, Augustine uses ex utero fundere as one of a range of expressions for 'to give birth': it suggests 'to bring forth' rather than the effort of childbirth, for which parturire or, more strongly, eniti is appropriate.40 The compound dijfundere , which Augustine uses in City of God to emphasise that Adam is the common source of all humanity,41 here links the birth of the human race with one of the central images of Confessions : water flowing out and away, spilling out of a container or over the banks of a river, to be contaminated with dirt or lost in the sands, or to swell into a raging torrent of custom or of passion.42 The human race born from Adam's womb is instabiliter fluidum , and water provides, for Augustine, an image of formlessness, dissipation and multiplicity, in the life of human beings and also in the universe. This imagery draws on the Neoplatonist concept of 'emanation' - outflowing - which provides some kind of answer to the question how multiplicity could ever come into being from the unity of the One. 'Emanation' is a modern, and not entirely satis- factory, label, and does not translate any one expression from the philosophical vocabulary. Plotinus offered a range of metaphors, including the diffusion of light and the 'outflow' or 'overflow' of being, to suggest how the One generates everything that is, but is not thereby diminished. Augustine develops the imagery of water spilling over as an expression of the overflow of being from the One into the many particular things which flow away into alienation from the One.43 Throughout book 13 of the Confessions , he relates 'overflow' to the chaos, darkness and flux out of which God brought the created world.</page><page sequence="8">96 E. G. CLARK defluxit angelus, defluxit anima hominis et indicaverunt abyssum universae spiritalis creaturae in profundo tenebroso, nisi dixisses ab initio 'fiat lux'.44 Opposed to this flux and dissipation is continentia , which has a much wider meaning than specifically sexual continence or the more general 'self-restraint'. 45 Augustine exploits the literal sense of continentia as 'containing' and 'holding together'. In the programmatic opening chapters of the Confessions , God continet everything, which would otherwise disperse and fragment into nothingness. In book 13, continentia makes it possible for the earth to produce 'living souls', for earth, from which God (in Genesis 2) formed Adam, is formless until it is given shape by God. This shaping takes place both in creation, when dry land is separated from the surrounding waters, and in the re-creation of the individual human being through the waters of baptism.46 Without continentia there is chaos, both in the universe and in the individual. Describing his individual development, at the beginning of book 2, Augustine links diffluere and ejfundere with the profusion of metaphors which express his adolescence: untended plants running to leaf but not to seed, darkness and fog, itching and scabs, and amidst it all iactabar et ejfundebar et dijfluebam et ebulliebam perfornicationes meas , so that finally defluxi abs te ego et erravi, deus meus, nimis devius ab stabilitāte tua in adulescentia, et f actus sum mihi regio egestatis .47 The solution is found in book 10, after many references to diffusion and dissipation: per continentiam quippe conligimur et redigimur in unum, a quo in multa defluximusA 8 Augustine's concern with spilling over and continentia has been interpreted as a particularly male anxiety about seminal emission, reinforced, no doubt, by nine years as a Manichee trying to avoid procreation, and perhaps also by his experience of sexual continence, which, as he acknowledges in Confessions 10, did not end either memories or emissions.49 Augustine argues in On the good of marriage, which he wrote in 401, that emission, like menstruation, is a natural phenomenon and not a manifestation of sin; the Old Testament requires purification for it because its formlessness is an image of sin (just as formlessness and dissipation is in Confessions 13). More rigorous ascetics held that emissions reveal a body which is still sexual, and thus show that perfect chastity has not been achieved, though according to John Cassian it can be (and that within six months, by a combination of rigorous fasting and the right mental attitude).50 But the imagery of continentia could also be invoked for the successful pregnancy of the uterus which holds its contents secure until it is time to bring them forth, fundere: thus amulets and spells represent a womb shut tight, not against conception but against the loss of offspring not yet formed.51 When the uterus of Adam brings forth the human race, insta- biliter fluidum like salt sea-water, this is a failure of continentia , not a full-term delivery. The image of the uterus as a container of fluid, specifically of sea- water, may well have been prompted by a psalm-text which Augustine does not cite here: verbo Domini caeli firmati sunt et spiritu oris eius omnis virtus eorum</page><page sequence="9">ADAM'S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 97 congregans sicut in utrem aquas maris ponens in thesauris abyssos.52 God gathers the waters of the sea sicut in utrem , as if into a skin bag for carrying water, and uter suggests uterus , the more so because of other Old Testament texts in which God has a uterus and gives birth from it. Thus Isaiah has God calling to Israel, qui portamini a meo utero qui gestamini a mea vulva.53 Augustine, of course, forcefully rejected any anthropomorphic suggestion that God literally has a uterus, or any other bodily part, which might be replicated in a human being made in God's image. The Psalmist represents God saying ex utero ante luciferum genui te, but Augustine comments quid est, ex utero? deus habuit uterum? putabimus deum per membra corporalia esse dispositum? absit!54 Similarly, in the book of Job, on which Augustine was commenting at the time of writing the Confessions or soon after, God asks Job quis est pluviae pater, vel qui genuit stillas roris? de cuius utero egressa est glacies, et gelu de cáelo quis genuit?55 and Augustine interprets uterus not literally, but as a metaphor for secretum.56 But although he avoids the literal interpretation, he can allow the metaphorical use to enrich his own language. He takes particular pleasure in physical metaphors, borrowed from Hebrew poetry, which perhaps revive a metaphor long dead in Latin.57 The Confessions are very rich in Biblical quotation and adaptation, but Augustine does not always cite passages which underlie his text, or complete a quotation even though all of it is important; he assumes a reader who shares his awareness. The psalm in which God gathers the sea sicut in utrem was in his mind because psalms always were in his mind and part of his daily worship, ever since they made their extraordinary impact on him when he was deciding to go forward for baptism,58 and this psalm presented itself because he was thinking about God's creation of the world and the separation of the sea and the dry land. His use of a psalm in Confessions can often be illuminated from the immense collection of his Enarrationes in Psalmos, expositions of the Psalms in sermon form or commentary. This applies even when the enarratio belongs to a different period of his work, for, like so many of us, he tended to make the same points in different works, sometimes in very similar words.59 He says about congregans sicut in utrem</page><page sequence="10">98 E. G. CLARK quia ergo modo salsa maris aqua, quae remansit, in christianos saevire non audet, occultum autem murmur rodit in se, et intra mortalem pellem fremit conclusa salsugo, videte quid sequitur: congregans sicut in utrem aquas maris.60 Here again is salsugo used of the sea. It is a rare word both for Augustine and in the Vulgate. He borrows it from the book of Job, where it refers to the salt desert in which the wild ass lives; in Notes on Job he explains the wild ass as the few who have escaped the yoke of worldly cares and passions, and who live in the salsugo so that their soul (like the dry land in Confessions 13) may cry to God sitivit in te anima mea.6] Neither salt desert nor salt sea has water fit to drink, but the sea is restless and menacing as well as barren. In the enarratio , the salsugo maris is kept within bounds, whereas in Confessions 13 it pours out, but in both it is an image for the turbulence of human nature; in the enarratio the 'skin bag' in which the sea-water is held is not the uterus, but the 'mortal skin' which delimits a human being. The 'salt sea' is an image of humanity not only because of its restless surge, but because it is bitter water. Again Augustine's explanation of a psalm- verse, [Deus] qui conturbas profundum maris , sonum fluctuum eius , is helpful: mare enim in figura dicitur saeculum hoc, salsitate amarum, procellis turbulentum, ubi homines cupiditatibus perversis et pravis facti sunt velut pisces in vicem se devorantes, attendite mare malum, mare amarum, fluctibus saevum, attendite qualibus hominibus plenum sit.62 These are not Augustinián leaps of exegesis, but familiar images of people devouring each other like fishes in the stormy sea of life.63 Augustine developed them in Confessions by linking the word-play mare malum , mare amarum with another word from the Psalms, amaricantes : quis congregavit amaricantes in societatem unam? idem namque illis finis est temporalis et terrenae felicitatis, propter quam faciunt omnia, quamvis innu- merabili varietāte curarum fluctuent, quis, domine, nisi tu, qui dixisti ut congre- garentur aquae in congregationem unam et apparet arida sitiens tibi, quoniam tuum est mare et tu fecisti illud, et aridam terram manus tuae formaverunt. neque enim amaritudo voluntatum sed congregatio aquarum vocatur mare, tu enim coherces etiam malas cupiditates animarum et Agis limites, quousque progredi sinantur aquae ut in se comminuantur fluctus earum, atque ita facis mare ordine imperii tui super omnia, at animas sitientes tibi et apparentes tibi alio fine distinctas a societate maris occulto et dulci fonte inrigas, ut et terra det fructum suum.64 Bitterness, in Confessions , is separation from the sweetness of God,65 and the amar- icantes are separated from God and each other by their desires. Only God can gather</page><page sequence="11">ADAM' S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 99 them together like the sea, setting limits to the swelling waves of their desires, and allowing the dry land, thirsty for God, to emerge from the bitter waters. The book of Job again supplies an unstated intertext: qui conclusit ostiis mare, quando erumpebat quasi de vulva procedens? cum ponerem nubem vestimentum eius, et caligine illud quasi pannis infantiae obvolverem? circumdedi illud terminis meis, et posui vectem et ostia, et dixi, Usque hue venies, et non procedes amplius, et hic confringes tumentes fluctus tuus.66 The sea which bursts as if from the womb, which is told to check its swelling waves, contributed to the salsugo maris , genus humanum . . . procellose tumidum which pours from the womb of Adam. The first characteristic Augustine gives to the salsugo maris , genus humanum is that it is profunde curiosum. Whereas profunde continues the image of the abyss, curiosum imports another range of Augustine's concerns. The stormy swell of desire which makes the human race procellose tumidum , and the unstable flux of physical existence which makes it instabiliter fluidum, are preceded by the chaotic restlessness of the human mind. Human curiositas, according to Augustine, is dissatisfied and spec- ulative, seeking to see and to know even when that knowledge will damage it, and disregarding clear instructions from God.67 Since Adam fell away from God, humans have lived in an unstable world and have had no certain knowledge. Earlier in book 13, Augustine draws an analogy between the firmament of heaven and the authority of Scripture. This analogy, like Adam's uterus, rests on verbal echoes in Scripture, and is also concerned with skin, but here the important word is pellis. When Adam and Eve fell and became mortal, sinful beings, God clothed them in tunics of skin (the mortalis pellis which, in Augustine's exposition of Psalm 32, enclosed the murmuring sea). A psalm supplies Augustine with the image that the heaven sicut pellis extenditur super nos, and he combines it with an apocalyptic text from Isaiah, caelum plicabitur ut liberi A book - as he need not say - is a skin, a parchment (for Isaiah, a scroll not a codex). So human beings beneath the firmament must look up to read God's book which is stretched over them, but the angels above the firmament do not need to look up, for they read God directly, without the sequence of time and syllables which fragments human reading.69 Humans, in the multiple physical realm which results from the fall away from God, have a text set in authority over them, and also have a multiplicity of signs and interpretations. These signs include the 'creeping things of living souls' and the great whales brought forth by the sea, which, interpreted figuratively, are sacraments and wonders moving through the waters of physical existence; and birds, which are messengers flying and calling over the earth.70</page><page sequence="12">100 E.G.CLARK Adam's womb, and the salty sea of humanity, are set in this context of figurative interpretation. If Adam had not fallen, the human race would not have not flowed from his womb, and so there would have been no need for God's agents to operate corpo- raliter et sensibiliter.1] But they do, and it is precisely in these multiple corporeal signs that we find multiple significance. Why is it, Augustine asks, that in Genesis 1 the command 'increase and multiply' is given to the fishes and birds brought forth by the sea, and to human beings, but is not given to the animals brought forth from the dry land? This omission must mean something: it cannot be said inaniter. Augustine suggests that we find increase and multiplicity in all kinds of things, physical and spiritual, and he lists all the categories of creation, and the figurative interpretations, he has so far discussed in book 13. But there are only two categories in which we find multiple interpretations of one thing: the signs which are given corporeal expression, that is, the creatures generated from the waters of physical existence, and intellectual concepts, which are produced by fertile human reason. Multiplicity, then, is both the problem and its solution (just as sexual awareness was both the punishment and damage-limitation for mortality). Book 13 of the Confessions gathers up the themes and the imagery of all that has gone wrong before: food that does not satisfy, fragmentation in time and over the multiplicity of created things, faulty reading of texts, the soul tormented and scarred by desire as the body is by illness, the bitter stormy sea. In book 1 3, the world, the body and the text are brought into harmony, and each can be read as an image of the other.72 The heavens are stretched out like a skin, which is also a parchment, a text of Scripture; the bitter sea-water, gathered into a skin bag which holds waters, is an image of humanity; the human body can be interpreted like a text, and the right exegesis of the text of Genesis explains what it is to be a human being in relation to God. novi enim multipliciter significan per corpus, quod uno modo mente intelligitur, et multipliciter mente intellegi, quod uno modo per corpus significatur.73 Multiple interpretations of the world, the body and the text can lead to the serenity of the Sabbath rest after the multiplicity of creation is complete, and that is Augustine's final prayer in the Confessions. Recent work on Augustine has often welcomed him as a precursor of postmodernism who allows multiple readings of a text to displace its human author. But whereas multiple readings of Augustine - profunde curiosae , procellose tumidae , instabiliter fluidae - may offer plurality, disruption and imper- mance, Augustine's readings, and Augustinián readings of Augustine's text, offer a return through multiplicity to the One from whom multiplicity derives. This paper began with a puzzle and ended with an illustration of how Augustine works. Almost any text from the Confessions would also lead the reader to a range of themes within the Confessions and interconnections with other works of Augustine and with the books Augustine read, especially but not exclusively the Bible. Students of Augustine often say that there is no satisfactory treatment of his style, especially in</page><page sequence="13">ADAM'S WOMB AND THE SALTY SEA 101 the Confessions ; but he works as other Latin authors do, by word-play and metaphor, and by allusion to other texts which may be only briefly evoked or may have to be remembered by the reader. He takes these techniques unusually far, partly for the sheer pleasure of words, but mostly because he believes they do something more important than enhance the reader's pleasure in complex reading: they demand attentive reading of a text - not the Confessions , but the Bible - which shapes the world as a whole, not just its own world. His style is difficult to discuss because it expresses what he is: a man educated in classical rhetoric, impressed by Platonist philosophy, who has trained himself to think with the words of a text which comes from Hebrew through Greek to Latin, and which he has to expound both to people for whom its language is natural and to people for whom it is alien. So the Latin words he uses have extra resonances within the Christian language-community,74 and his metaphors have the startlingly physical intensity of Hebrew poetry. His intertexts are rarely classical and are often multiple, because of the principles of exegesis he derived both from his classical education and from his theological reflection: divinely inspired texts do not express contradictions, and their meaning is to be explored by comparisons and associations with other parts of the text. The same principles can be applied to Augustine, though it is some years since they have been applied in the belief (not shared by Augustine) that Augustinián doctrine must be consistent over time. Gibb and Montgomery were right about Adam's womb: it is, indeed, a remarkable example of catachresis, of words 'transferred' both for the sheer pleasure, quod delectat , and because Augustine thought it necessary, quod opus est , to convey what he wanted to say. Much unpacking and importing has been needed to expound a small section of text. I hope to have unpacked what was there and to have imported material that Augustine had in mind, but (as he knew) human reading is time-bound and imperfect. UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL E. G. CLARK NOTES 1. Aug. Conf. 13.20.28 (CCL 27: 257). I note at once, and with admiration, Prof. E. J. Kenney's suggested emendation (in discussion) from eius to Euae. This would remove many of the problems discussed in the first part of the paper, but neither manuscripts nor editors (and there are many of both) offer support, and the text, according to its most recent editor, is 'generally sound' (J. J. O'Donnell, Augustine, Confessions I (1992) lvi). I have, therefore, kept to the generally accepted reading. 2. O'Donnell (n.l) III 388, citing J. Gibb and W. Montgomery, The Confessions of Augustine (1927) ad loc. O'Donnell does not engage in detailed analysis of this passage, but it is a pleasure to acknowledge his help, both through his commentary and in discussion. 3. Cic. Orator 92-4 ( OCT ed.

The discussion which follows is indebted to J. N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (1982) 100-9, and J. André, Le vocabulaire latin de l'anatomie (1991) 188-93, especially for the usage of fourth-century medical writers. Adams notes that uterus does not survive into any Romance language as the word for 'womb'. 7. Celsus 4.1 uses uterus for abdominal cavity (4) and vulva for womb (1 1-12): sub corde atque pulmone traversům ex valida membrana saeptum est , quod praecordiis uterum divisit. For the vocabulary of Celsus, see further D. Langslow, 'The development of Latin medical terminology: some working hypotheses' , PCPS 37 (1991) 106-30. OLD has a remarkable definition of vulva : (1) the womb, (2) the female sexual organ. Read 'organs'? 8. The task is being carried out by the monks of Beuron in Ve tus Latina: Die Reste der lateinischen Bibel (1951- ). 9. It is often argued that the passio of the Scillitan martyrs (who died in 1 80) contains the earliest reference to Latin versions of the Bible: but this depends on the assumption that these North African martyrs knew Latin but not Greek. See further F. Ruggiero, Atti dei martiri Scilitani (1991) 1 10, and on the date of the earliest Latin versions T. D. Barnes, Tertullian: a historical and literary study (1985) 276-8. Augustine comments on the concerns of the early translators in De doctrina Christiana 2.13.19 (CCL 32: 44-5). 10. Adams (n.6) 105 cites Gen. 29.31, 30.22; Lk 2.23 as examples of vulva for mētra , and Gen. 25.22-3, 38.24 and 27; Lk 1.31, 41, 44, as examples of uterus for gastēr or koilia. Similarly, Greek versions of the Bible reflected variations in Hebrew vocabulary: I am indebted to my colleague Alan Millard for advice on this point. 1 1 .
