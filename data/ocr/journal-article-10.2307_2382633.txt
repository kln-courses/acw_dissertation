<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meaning of Kami Chapter IH* Kami Considered as Mana By D. C. Holtom, Yokohama. In the preceding sections of our study we have examined the philological references of the word kami, and although the hypothetical nature of the outcome has been such as to induce a large amount of caut- ion into any attempt to build very hopefully on this form of research, we have nevertheless been able to establish a certain degree of direction by noting the most important etymological conclusions arrived at by Japan- ese investigators. Although we have had to forego any clear expectat- ion of being able to decide what kami denotes when reduced to its literal verbal elements, we are, at the same time, whatever the original word- roots may mean, prepared to look for a primitive psychological matrix in reactions of awe and mystery in the presence of the unknown and uncon- trolled. This tentative position has been made more affirmative by our examination of expositions of content made by representative Japanese writers, as exhibited in the historical usages of the term. The direction in which the researches of these men point us is again towards the study of an ancient and universally human emotional response to the awesome, out of which has grown the sentiment which modern man comprehends in the terms holy and sacred. We must now pass on to the attempt to make a more detailed clarification of this position. The critical apparatus and technique of investigation made use of by western students in exploring the roots of the early religious life of man have been referred to in a previous paragraph, and now in the interests of explication, the conclusion to which the historical and literary evidence that is to be set forth below leads us must be anticipated sufficiently to make possible an understanding of the unifying point of view from which the entire field must be surveyed. Over against this position there may be those who might wish to maintain that, if the various meanings of kami arrived at as the result of critical investigation are so disparate and * See chapters I and II, Mon. Nipp., III, p. 1 ss. and 392 ss.</page><page sequence="2">26 D. C. Holtom 352 unrelated that unity appears impossible, then the thesis to be employed here becomes altogether gratuitous. At first sight such an objection may seem plausible. The diversity appears to be discouragingly complete. Mysterious animals, thunder and lightning, mountains, trees and waters, implements of magic, spirits and demons, evil powers as well as good, objects that repel by their awfulness over against those that attract by their kindliness and beauty, the souls of the dead, powverful members of human society in this world, and finally a vast host of legitimate gods and goddesses that have been born out of man's feeling of dependence on beneficent and mighty agencies in nature-all of these strangely varied objects of experience are kami. It is apparent at the outset that it is futile to approach the study from the point of view of the contemporary occid- ental idea of god. The fact that objects and events which must be classified outside of the proper modern definition of deity are numerous among the kami makes it necessary to look for an original complex of ex- perience beneath the kami-idea, or the kami-emotion, that is broader and more fundamental than the idea of god. We are not dealing here with a conception that can be exclusively equated in its primary significance with the notion of god as formulated in present-day western theology or even as the deposit of the study of the history of religions, but rather with a more fundamental emotion out of which the gods themselves have grown. The truth lies in the direction of following out the implications contained in the profound observation by Otto already noted-a line of study that Otto himself does not undertake, since he is soon back on the well worn track of western doctrine and its attempted vindication-namely, the truth that the representations of spirits, souls, gods and goddesses in the Japan- ese overworld are simply modes of interpreting a precedent experience or emotion to which they are subsidiary, that conceptions of personalized spirits and gods are forms that indicate a rationalization of religion, not the original springs of religion itself. It can be asserted with emphasis that the various religious usages of kami in the ancient Shinto literature can be unified, but not with the ordinary thought-forms of contemporary theology. If we are going to deal adequately with the data we must resort to a category of classificat- ion that properly recognizes the unique psychological characteristics of pre-literate men, and if possible one which was used by these men them- selves and which has been adopted by modern students of social origins. Such a category exists and has been widely employed in recent anthro- pological literature. It is the term mana. In what follows, the attempt will be made to show that the Japanese term kami belongs to the mana</page><page sequence="3">353 The Meaning of Kami 27 type of religious classification, that kami is in fact the Japanese expression for mana. This necessitates a preliminary outline of the meaning of the latter term. Mana has been explained so frequently and so carefully by recent writers on anthropology and the history of religions that only certain of the salient aspects of usage and meaning need come up for review here. The term was introduced to the western world by R. H. Codrington in his work on the Melanesians published in 1891 and was first employed as a general category for the study of religious origins by R. R. Marett a few years later. In introducing the term, Codrington says: The word is common I believe to the whole Pacific, and people have tried very hard to describe what it is in different regions. I think I know what our people mean by it, and that meaning seems to me to cover all that I hear about it elsewhere. It is a power or influence, not physical, and in a way supernatural; but it shows itself in physical force, or in any kind of power or excellence which a man possesses. This mana is not fixed in anything, and can be conveyed in almost anything; but spirits, whether disembodied souls or supernatural beings, have it and can impart it, though it may act through the medium of water, or a stone, or a bone.') Again, he describes mana as: A force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control.2` In fuller exposition he writes: If a man has been successful in fighting, it has not been his natural strength of arm, quickness of eye, or readiness of resource that has won success; he has certainly got the mania of a spirit of some deceased warrior to empower him, con- veyed in an amulet of stone round his neck, or a tuft of leaves in his belt, in a tooth hung upon a finger of his bow hand, or in the form of words with which he brings supernatural assistance to his side. If a man's pigs multiply, and his gardens are productive, it is not because he is industrious and looks after his property, but because of the stones full of mana for pigs and yams which he possesses. Of course a yam naturally grows when planted, that is well known, but it will not grow very large unless mana be brought to bear upon it, a net will not catch many fish, nor an arrow inflict a mortal wound.3) A brief reference to the wider usage in Oceanic languages may serve to give further clarity to the above citations.

With this outline of original and derivative meanings before us we may follow Marett with full approval when he says that mana in its prim- ary sense is the wonder-working power with which extraordinary men, objects, or events may be charged. In further exposition this author describes mana as an all-pervasive occult force, manifesting itself here, there and everywhere in most momentary experiences with strange cir- cumstances, as well as in recurrent or in constantly manifested events that baffle the intelligence and stir the emotions. Mana sanctifies, and at the same time reveals, the " divine right " of the aristocratic class to rule; it is the authority behind the taboo wherewith the inviolable right of the governing class is enforced. It appears in the majesty and power of priests, medicine-men, chiefs, and kings and can be transmitted by 4) Tregear, Edward, Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary, p. 203. Wel- lington, N. Z., 1891. 5) Tregear, op. cit.</page><page sequence="5">355 The Meaning of Kami 29 means of all objects that have been in contact with these personages. It is the " strong heart " or " uplift " acquired in the discipline of ascetic abstinence or inner contemplation, and, again, it is the mysterious activity set in motion by ritual. As the awful power lurking in the occult, it may appear as a divine beneficence or as a diabolical malevolence; it may give rise to good gods or to evil demons. Mana is thus the root-idea both of religion and of black magic.6) The simple perusal of the data just set forth makes the psychologic- al motivation of the mana symbol (concept) almost immediately self- evident An event, object, or person that possesses mana, or one that is in and of itself mana, has first of all by virtue of some manifestation of power, excellence, strangeness, weirdness, or perhaps even of over-power- ing loveliness, stimulated emotions of admiration, wonder, reverence, awe, fear, expansion, or caution in the breast of the beholder, and thus thrown the attention into extraordinary activity. In our attempt to un- derstand this matter we must never lose sight of the fact that all of the interpretative terms just introduced are a part of a form of analysis that has been imposed on the original situation by the requirements of our modern thinking. Pre-literate man is not thus introspective and analy- tical. In the presence of an extraordinary circumstance wherein he finds mana to reside he feels an unwanted emotion, and the fact of the exist- ence of the emotion becomes the spontaneously engendered ground on wlhich a corresponding cause of the emotion is projected into the out- ward circumstance. He possesses no adequate psychological instruments wherewith to analyze his feelings, but he strongly senses the presence of a power that has come out from the object which has thrown him into awareness. This power has strangely smitten him, and the emotion thus vividly sensed is the secure ground on which the objective existence of mana is arrived at. It is there because it is strangely felt. It is thus experienced unreflectively as an occult power that has passed from an outside event or object or person into the human recipient. It is not the result of speculation on experience-no evidence of a primitive notion of pantheism-it is immediately given as an inevitable emotional datum in the stimulating experience itself. " Mana " says Marett, " thus implies a religious experience that is primarily of the perceptual order, a frame of mind in which the sacred is simply 'sensed '."') This apprehension is 6) Marett, R.

EIoltom 356 not first given through the intellect, but rather through a powerful stimu- lation of the emotions. The objects that induce the mana-feeling may seem strangely diverse and uncorrelated when approached from the point of view of the categor- ies of modern thought, but they are all, nevertheless, intimately bound together in the possession of a power to strike sharply into the human heart. The originat events are all extraordinary, new, mysterious, un- canny, terrifying, " lovely," majestic, overwhelming, full of power, or of unusual significance; that is, not controllable within the range of the technique of the ordinary folkways. The unique object of experience, whether thunder, lightning, storm, miraculous sword, stone of odd shape, uncanny animal, efficacious medicine, healer of sickness, worker of witch- craft, skilful hunter, swift runner, great chief, or mighty sovereign- whatever it may be-emanates a strange power and induces an unusual emotional response. This response is the "religious thrill." The attention is thrown into a special activity ; a "watch-out " attitude is induced which perhaps originally had its vocal registration merely in an exclamation or cry. The emotion is found to repeat itself in contact with a multitude of different objects or events that externally appear to have no connection whatsoever. Nevertheless the uniformity of the emotion becomes the ground on which a belief is reached of the existence of a mysterious agency operating as an outgoing power in all the various objects that have stimulated the emotion itself. This is mana, or, to use the Japanese term for the same thing, it is kami. Since there is no place for the unique, power-bearing object, event or person in the ordinary, well known, everyday world, it is put in a mysterious, " over-head," super-ordinary world; it is surrounded with taboos that register the feel- ings of the unapproachability or " awfulness " of the " sacred " object, and treated with a special ritualistic technique. By the ordinary prin- ciples of magic the wonder-working power of this original object may be transmitted in anything that has been brought into contact with it or which imitates it in form or function. Contact between ordinary human beings and all objects or persons that mediate this occult power must be safe- guarded with correct precautionary ceremony, and these precautionary activities become sacred customs and rituals. This accounts for the al- most exclusive predominance of a ritualistic, taboo-respecting procedure in all early religions over doctrinal elaboration, and gives point to Marett's penetrating remark that the mana-taboo formula which underlies all early ritual is a manifestation of " a phase of the religious life in which the need of coming into contact with the mysteries of life is satisfied mainly</page><page sequence="7">357 The Meaning of Kami 31 by ritual action, running ahead of articulate and reasoned doctrine, but none the less powerfully moving."8) With this introductory material as a background we may return our attention to the Japanese field and undertake the identification of the na- ture of certain of the most significant objects, events and personages that the early Japanese people included in the kami-category. We turn first to certain pertinent aspects of early Japanese magic. Implements of Magic 1. Road Kami.-Barrier stones and phallic emblems. We begin this part of the discussion by introducing the " staff " of the old Japanese Sky Father, Izanagi-no-Kami. The study of this appar- ently incidental piece of personal equipment opens an unexpected gate- way to the understanding of early Japanese folkways and beliefs regarding kami. The staff appears in the early literature (Nihongi) in connection with the account of the flight of Izanagi-no-Kami from the Land of Death where he had gone in search of his lost mate, Izanami-no-Kami. Frustrat- ed in his attempt to bring back his wife to the world of the living, he flees from her presence, pursued by the Eight Thunders of Yomi. He holds back these malignant powers by first casting down in their path the fruit of the peach tree and then his staff. Then Izanagi flung down his staff, saying; " The thunders may not come be- yond this." It (the staff) was called Funado-no-Kami (" Pass-not-Place-Kami"), and was originally called Kunado-no-Oji (" Come-not-Place-Great-Ancestor ").9) That this kami has phallic significance may be inferred from an exam- ination of the meanings of the titles just given in connection with what the objects originally signified in ancient Japanese belief and ritual. The evidence supports the conclusion that the myth concerning Izanagi's staff rested on an early and widespread practice of erecting phallic images by the wayside and at road crossings as magical means of warding off pestilence and other forms of evil. We here meet with an old belief that the wayside phallus was a wonder-working kami and glimpses of an early mythological fancy that called it the staff of Izanagi. In support of these remarks we must make a further examination of some of the related data. Funado-no-Kami, given above as one of the two names applied to Izanagi's staff in the Nihongi account is variously written. It appears 8) Marett op. cit. 9) Aston, W. G., Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 30. London, 1924.</page><page sequence="8">32 D. C. Holtom 358 in a mixed phonetic-ideographic combination as: P iT meaning, Pass- not-Place-Kami--ftfu (phonetic) for funa, a negative verbal form signify- ing, to pass not; )f do, place; and TiO kami. The whole stands for an ob- struction of some sort set against the ingress of evil. The name is again written, a / tit and read as aboVe, Funado-no-Kami.'0) It meart according to the sense of the ideograms, Crossroads-Kami- K given the value of funa, to pass not, but commonly read chimata, cross- way, branch, or futamata, forked (cf. mata, groin, crotch, forks). The title Chimata-no-Kami is well known as an ancient name for a phallic Kami. The fact that mata signifies groin, thigh, crotch, or fork may possibly point to the original association which, under the operation of the principles of imitative magic, made the human Crotch-Kami also a Road-Forks-Kami. Yamakawa Uichi in his dictionary of Shinto deities includes Funado- no-Kami, the name here given to Izanagi's staff, under his discussion of Barrier-Kami (Sae-no-Kami),1') or stones set up by the wayside and at crossroads to ward off the powers of evil. He explains Sae-no-Kami thus: They are Kami set up as obstructions at crossroads to stop and hold back evil. They include the three Kami: Yachimata-HikoI2) (" Eight-Crossroads- Prince "), Yachimata-HimeW3) (" Eight-Crossroads-Princess "), and Funado. In the Wamyosho,14) Sae-no-Kami is read Ddsojini5) (" Road-Ancestor-Kami ")..6) The verbal element ya of Yachimata literally means eight, as given in the translation. It stands merely for a large number and here designates a place where various roads meet, probably -in most cases not more than two. The Shinto Encyclopaedia (Shinto Daijiten) explains the two Chimata-Kami as follows: Yachimata-Hiko-no-Kami and Yachimata-Hime-no-Kami are Husband-and- Wife-Kani. They are Kami set on roads to keep back devils, demons, and evil spirits [moryo, that is, malicious spirits or ghosts haunting mountains, waters, 10) Yamakawa, Uichi, JJI?, Jingi Jiten fi$TfiJT;.

In ancient times these two Kami along with Kutnado-no-Kami [same as Funado-no-Kami] were worshipped in the Festival of the Road-Kami, carried out at the four boundaries of the capital.'7) D&amp;sojin, or Road-Ancestor-Kami, the name given above as the equi- valent of Sae-no-Kami, is still in wide use among the Japanese people as the ordinary popular title of a phallic Kami. A longer title for Izanagi's staff appears in the Kojiki in the account of certain purification rites carried out by Izanagi after his return from the Under World: Therefore the Great-Deity-the-Male-Who-Invites [Izanagi-no-Okami] said: "t Nay! I have come to a hideous and polluted land,-That I have! So I will perform the purification of my august person." So he went out to a plain (covered with) ahagi at a small river-mouth near Tachibana in Himuka in (the island of) Tsukushi and purified and cleansed himself. So the name of the Kami that was born from the august staff which he threw down was the Kami, Thrust-erect- Come-- o-Place-Kami [Tsuki-tatsu-Funado-no-Kamils)].19) The significance of the name of this Kami is explained for us again in the Shinto Encyclopaedia: In the beliefs of the Nihongi and the Kojikai this Kami is assimilated to an identity with Kunado-no-Kami [same as Funado-no-Kami], Chimata-no-Kami, and Sae-no-Kami [i.e., to the protective function of a waysi e or crossroads phallus- D.C.H.] . . . The meaning of the title is that of Pass-not-Place,20) and expresses a tradition which set up objects and believed that Kami existed in these barrier places that could not be passed over.2") "Thrust-erect," or " Pierce-erect," in the title of this Kami has been taken to indicate the manner in which Izanagi set his staff in the sand."2 We must believe, however, that the story at this point is founded on pre- existing ceremonial practice and suggest that " thrust-erect " refers to the manner in which the original objects were erected by the roadside, that is, that it has ithyphallic associations. The examination of the alternate title of the staff of Izanagi that appears in the passage from the Nihongi cited at the beginning of this sect- ion confirms the conclusions just arrived at. Aston has rendered this name in the form of Kunado-no-Oji,'3) and understands it to mean " Come- 17) Shinto Daijiten, Vol. III, p. 367. 18) FJi$. 19) Chamberlain, Kojiki, pp. 46-47.

Holtom 360 not-Great-Place-Elder" (or " Ancestor "). He correctly interprets Kunado as having essentially the same significance as funado, that is, the former as meaning " come-not-place," the latter, as " pass-not-place." He is perplexed as to functions, however. In a note by Aston published in the 1932 edition of Chamberlain's translation of the Kojiki, in connec- tion with the incident of the erection of Izanagi's staff at the time of his purification from the contamination of the Land of Death, he raises the question as to whether the account reflects an- old practice of setting up a post to warn people not to approach too closely to a spot where a Iharai (purification ceremony) was being performed.24) We can answer this question by calling attention again to the beliefs and ceremonial usages that lie behind the myth. We repeat once more the conclusion that the story of the staff of Izanagi reflects a practice that survived in certain areas of Japan even into modern times of setting up phallic images by way- sides and at crossroads as magical barriers against the incoming of demonic powers and other forms of evil. The fact that the staff myth has this ceremonial reference is made plain for Old Shinto in the norito used in the ancient Festival of the Road- Kami (Michiae-no-Matsuri) of the Engishiki. The portion of the text which introduces the kunado name of Izanagi's staff reads: We announce before the sovereign Kami which block the great-eight-roads like multitudinous rock masses, and calling the names of Yachimata-Hiko, Yachi- mata-Hime, and Kunado, we humbly fulfill our words of praise. Keep us from meeting face to face and from having contact with things that come with violence and assault form the Root Country, the Bottom Country. If they come from be- low, guard the below; if they come from above, guard the above. Guard with a guard by day and a guard by night.25) This passage gives us the same trinity that we have already had brought to our attention: The Husband-and-Wife-Kami (Yachimata- Hiko and Yachimata-Hime), and Kunado, or Izanagi's staff. The evid- ence here supports the inference that they were originally rocks or stones and is conclusive that they were set up not to protect sacred spots from human defilement but rather to protect men against the incoming of mysterious evil. This interpretation is made more definite when we make further study of the Kojiki account of certain barrier stones that were set up by Izanagi to block the progress of demonic powers emerging from the Lowver 24) Chamberlain, Kojiki, ibid. 25) Kokushi Taikei, , Bk. 26, p. 171.</page><page sequence="11">361 The Meaning of Kami 35 World. These stones were included among the Kami and are so named in the record. After the thunder demons had been turnied back, the lost wife, now transformed into an enraged fury, takes up the chase: Last of all his younger sister, Her Augustness the Princess-Who-Invites [Izanami-no-Mikoto] came out herself in pursuit. So he drew a thousand-draught rock, and (with it) blocked up the Even Pass of Hades. . . . Again the rock with which he blocked up the Pass of Hades is called the Great-Kami-of-the-Road- Turning-back (Chi-gaeshi-no-Okami26)), and again it is called the Blocking-Great- Kami-of-the-Road-Turning (Sayari-Masu- Yomido-no-OkaMni2V)).28) The Kami of the " Road-Turning-back," or the same object under another name, the " Blocking Kami of the Door to the Lower World," is merely another name for the phallic Kami, Kunado or the staff of Iza- nagi, by whose wonder-working power pestilence was prevented from entering the world of living men. At least the two Kami, if originally separable, were early assimilated to an identical form. The myth of blocking the way to Hell with large stones merely repeats the theme of the casting down of Izanagi's staff. Behind both stories lies the ancient Japanese practice of setting up phallic emblems as the guardians of roads and crossings. We may be sure that the actual folk-usage gave rise to the myth and not vice versa. Support for this position, derived from the writings of Japanese authorities, confirms that evidence that appears in the passage from the Engishiki that we have already noted. In the course of their discuss- ion of Sae-no-Kami, or Barrier-Kami, given in the Shint6 Encyclopaedia, the authors say: The Chi-gaeshi-no-Kami [Kami-of-the-Road-Turning-back], or, under another name, the Sayari-Masu- Yomido-no-Okami [the Karni Who Blocks the Door to Hell] is a Ksami which resides along roads and is symbolized by large stones. He possesses the power to ward off evil spirits. Kunado-no-Kami [Izanagi's staff], which appears in the ancient literature, also possesses the same kind of divine power, and accordingly the two Kami at some time became merged into one.29) The above explanation should be qualified at one point. There is nothing in the early records to justify the conclusion that these Kami were originally regarded merely as symbols. Both Izanagi's staff and the barrier stones are explicitly named as being Kami in and of themselves. Interpretations which make them shintai (" god-bodies "), or dwelling 27) ti-,t 28) Chamberlain, Kojiki, pp. 46-47. 29) Shint5 Daijiten, Vol. II, p. 93.</page><page sequence="12">36 D. C. Holtom 362 places of the Kami, or which regard them as symbols of the divine pres- ence, must be regarded as of a later date. The point just noted must be pressed further and the actual phallic significance of these road-protecting, barrier Kami more specifically clarif- ied. Dr. Kato Genchi may be cited as authority for the statement that all the Barrier-Kami noted above have phallic meaning. He speaks of Sae-no-Kami, the inclusive name of this kind of Kami, or magical object, as\ " a phallic god that appears in the Kojiki and the Nihongi."30) Elsewhere he observes that Sae-no-Kami, Funado-no-Kami, D3sojin, Yachimata- Hzko, and Yachimnata-Himne must each one be understood as " a veritable Japanese Priapos."'31) This conclusion is supported when we connect the material thus far presented, particularly that concerning Izanagi's staff, with the Kojiki and Nihongi account of the "jewel-spear of Heaven " presented to Izanagi- no-Kami and his wife by the Celestial Deities when the former pair were sent down from Takama-ga-Hara to " make, consolidate, and give birth to " the Japanese islands. They thrust down with this spear and stirred about with it in the ocean and the drippings from its end were fertilized into an island.32) The significance of this spear may be taken as essent- ially the same as that of Izanagi's staff. Hirata states that the shape of the jewel-spear was that of a phallus.33) Sato Nobuhiro, a writer of the Tokugawa period, cited by Kato, says: The Ame-zo-Nuboko, or Heavenly-Jewel-Spear, which the Ancestral Deities in Heaven bestowed upon Izanagi and Izanami had the shape of a phallus, so that the divine couple got a suggestion through it and were overjoyed in their nuptial union, begetting different gods successively.34) Dr. Kato's entire discussion should be consulted for numerous liter- ary references to the erection of phallic emblems by roadsides and at cross- ways. The practice has survived in isolated districts right up into con- temporary times. Aston says that, travelling from Utsunomiya to Nikka in 1871, he found the road lined at intervals with groups of phalli.3;) Kato gives more recent examples. Although this latter author does not 30) Kato, Genchi, " A Study of the Development of Religious Ideas among the Japanese People as Illustrated by Japanese Phallicism," Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Second Series, Supplement to Vol. I, Dec., 1924, p. 6. 31) A Study of Shinto: The Religion of the Japanese Nation, p. 31.

On their functional side they bring fertility to field and family, ward off the evils of demonic powers and malignant diseases, protect travelers, bring feliCity to married life and promote the happiness and union of lovers. All this is of one piece with the picture of the meaning of the "staff " of the Sky Father which we have been trying to sketch. The Kami of the Evening Oracle " of the Manyoshu, sought in divination rites by lovers at the beginning of night that they might be brought into happy union, and before whom " staffs " were set up, was no other than -the phallic barrier Kami, Funado, that is to say, the staff of Izanagi.36) The " staffs " in this case were made of wood, just as are most of the phallic emblems that can still be diocovered even today at certain of the remote rural shrines. We must summarize witn a brief word the discussion thus far. The oly reasonable hypothesis on which the data which we have just presented can be coherently explained must be one that makes primary room for the assertion that the early Japanese people, thrown into emotions of myst- ery and awe in the presence of the unknown operations of sex and its strange fertility-giving attributes made emblems of the sex organs and employed them as magical protective agencies at crossroads and waysides. In the basic human experience they were the mysterious source of life and thereby functionally endowed, as were no other objects, to preserve and promote vitality, and drive back the dread powers thatconstantly pressed upon man from the abode of disease and death. They gave kami-names to these objects first of all, because they were filled with a wonder-working power. 2. Peaches. Called kami because of magical significance. Connection with female sex magic. The above study may be supplemented by noting the significance of certain peaches which Izanagi also cast down as a barrier against the oncoming of the demonic powers that chased him out of the Lower World. The term which we have under investigation as our central theme appears in the form of kamrt, or in an adjectival relationship, in the title given to these peaches. In the citation given below Chamberlain translates it by the word " divine." This must be understood to mean the possession of the quality of " sacredness," or wonder-working power, in the sense of mana. 36) Satow, Ernest, "Ancient Japanese Rituals," Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Reprints, Vol. II, Dec., 1927, p. 67.</page><page sequence="14">38 D. C. Holtom 364 The story is again that of Izanagi fleeing from the Land of Death,. pursued by the eight thunders: And as they still pursued, he took, on reaching the base of the Even Pass of Hades, three peaches that were growing at its base, and waited and smote (his pursuers therewith), so that they all fled back. Then Izanagi-no-Mikoto announc-- ed to the peaches: " Like as ye have helped me, so must ye help all living people in the Central Land of Reed-plains whell they shall fall into troublcus circum- stances and be harassed "-and he gave (to the peaches) the designatio of Their-Augustnesses-Great-Divirre-Fruit [O-Kamu-dzu-Mi-no-Mikoto37)].38) The Nihongi account of the same event gives definite expression to the idea that a magical usage of peaches in the ancient Japanese folkways lies back of this myth of the smiting of the powers of evil. Then the thunders all arose and pursued him. Now by the roadside there grew a large peach tree at the foot of which Izanagi-no-I likoto concealed himself. He accordingly took its fruit and flung it to the thunders, upon which the thund- ers all ran away. This was the origin of the practice of keeping off evil spirits by means of peaches.39) Evidence of Chinese influence on early Japanese culture has been found in this story. Chinese folkways also attributed magical qualities to peaches. Aston mentions a mythical Chinese being called Si Wang Mu who possessed a peach tree the fruit of which conferred immlortality on man.4' Kato notes a similar magical significance in the indigenous Japoanese practice. He cites from the Nihon Shoki Sanso4l) (" Comment- ary on the Nihongi ") by the fifteenth century scholar, Ichijo Kaneyoshi,42) a passage which included in part quotations from other writers, as fol- lows: Peaches are used to drive aw,vay devils.... Devils dislike the branches of the peach tree (growing on) the east and the south and run away from them. This is a means of getting rid of sickness. . . . If, on the day of the hare of the early part of the third month, one gathers peaches (growing on) the south and hangs them above the door, devils will not enter.43) Although this was written many centuries after the Nihongi and Kojiki, there is good ground for inferring a continuity of magical practice 37) Written phonetically: , for 7 38) Chamberlain, Kojiki, pp. 43-44. 39) Aston, Nihongi, p. 30. 40) Op. cit., note 1. 41) H iI2 PiL. 42) =UQ. 43) Kato Genchi ; Shinto no Shziky3 Hattatsushi teki Kenkyu7 gIIPMiD0 MA&amp;--PrjIFPLI ("The Study of the Historical Development of Shinto as a Religion"), p. 143.

In both the Izanagi story and the fifteenth century account the wonder-working power of the peach was believed to operate in the same direction, that is, the repulsion of demonic evil and sickness from the homes of living men. As we shall have occasion to point out below, the explanation of the magic- al efficacy of the peach probably lies in the same field of phallic associat- ion as does the staff of Izanagi. Survivals of the old notions of the talis- manic potency of the peach exist in contemporary Japan. In the cere- mony of the exorcism of devils performed at numerous shrines in the present, the stones of peaches and small particles made from the branches of the peach tree are scattered about in order to drive out demonlic evil. Staves of peach-wood were once used for the same purpose. The answer to the question as to the actual genetic connlection of peaches with magical process probably lies along the lines already suggested. The peach stands for the kteis, and the mysterious powers attributed to it lie in its appropriateness in female sex representation. Like the phallus it bears within itself the marvelous resources of life, health and vigor and hence is a mighty prophylactic against the demonic powers that bring sickness and misfortune. In the Chinese legenrd mentioned above, the magical peach tree that produced the fruit of immortality be- longed to a woman. Momotaro, the " Peach-child " of Japanese legend, was born from a peach that split open. Momo may mean either peach or thigh. We pass on to the examination of certain other magical objects of early Shinto. 3. Magical scarfs, mirrors, swords, and jewvels. The Eight Great Kami of Idzushi. The discussion may well begin with the introduction of the "Eight Great Kami of Idzushi."44) These were certain implements of magic, called O-Kami, which, according to the Kojiki and the Niliongi, were carried from Korea to Japan by Ama-no-Hiboko, a prince of Silla, in the year twenty-seven B. C., following the traditional reckoning. They are described in the Kojiki as follows: So the things which Ama-no-Hiboko brought over here, and which were called the " precious treasures," were: two strings of pearls [beads] ; likewise a wave-shaking scarf, a wave-cutting-scarf, a wind-shaking scarf, and a wind-cut- ting scarf; likewise a mirror of the offing and a mirror of the shore;-eight articles in all.4D) 44) - -Atr . 45) Chamberlain, Kojiki, 316.</page><page sequence="16">40 D. C. Holtom 366 The text of the Kojiki adds as a note to the above the remark: "These are the Eight Great Kami of Idzushi."46) Idzushi is the name of a district, at present included in Hyogo prefecture. A shrine dating from an in- definite antiquity, and now accorded the rank of a national shrine of middle grade (Kokuhei Chfisha), provides shelter for the eight treasures. The Scarfs Altogether they include two strings of beads, two mirrors and four scarfs.47) They are objects such as were necessary to insure the safe passage of the waters between Korea and Japan. Chamberlain calls attention to the magical character of the scarfs when he explains them as : " a scarf to raise the wind and a scarf to still the wind." Shinto sources describe the " scarf "48) as an ornamental cloth worn anciently on the heads of women and hanging down over the shoulders to the breasts.49) It may be more than mere conjecture to suggest that its magical potency was an impartation from the mysterious quality of the female hair, but this of course is uncertain. The fact that it appears frequently in the early liter- ature as a wonder-working agency is assured. One or two examples may be noted. The Kojiki relates the story of the visit of O-Kuni-Nushi-no-Kami, the god of Idzumo, to Susa-no-Wo-no-Kami, the storm god, in the " Ne- ther-Distant-Land " and his marriage to the daughter of the latter deity. Susa-no- Wo-no-Kami made his unwelcome son-in-law sleep in the snake- house: Hereupon his [O-Kuni-Nushi's] wife, Her Augustness the Forward-Princess, gave her husband a snake scarf, saying: " When the snakes are about to bite thee, drive them away by waving this scarf thrice." So, on his doing as she had instructed, the snakes became quiet, so that he came forth after calm slumbers. Agaia on the night vf the next day [the Impetuous-Male-Deity-Susa-no-Wo-no- Kami] put him into the centipede and wasp-house; but as she gave him a centipede and wasp-scarf, and instructed him as before, he came forth calmly.50) 46) lltEK `;P.-L-JiiFp-1Tt.

In another account of the same, the Nihongi lists: three gems, two swords, a " sun-mirror," a spear, and a himorogi-eight objects, the same in number as the " Eight Kami " of the Kojiki but differing considerably in nature.

The text says: These are: one mirror of the offing, one mirror of the shore, one eight-hand- span sword, one life-giving jewel, one health-giving jewel, one life-restoring jewel, one road-warding jewel, one, snake-scarf, one bee-scarf, and one scarf of manifold efficacy. The Gods of Heaven taught that if these ten treasures are shaken back and forth and words " one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten " are uttered, they will heal anyone who is in physical pain and restore life to the dead.52) These two citations help to place in perspective the background of ancient Japanese magic against which we can estimate the significance of the Eight Great Kami of Idzushi. They all were kami because from them issued an occult power. Dr. Kato Genchi adds his authority to the view that they were first called kami because of the mysterious and magical potency with which they were thought to have been endowed. He says: The fact that the Kojiki gives the title of " The Eight Great Kami of Idzushi" to these eight objects indicates that marvelous and mysterious power was believed to exist in such things, and if we go back to origins, we see that each of these ob- jects was a kind of wvonderful fetish.53) This conclusion is substantiated by an examination of the two other objects included in the original group of Idzushi treasures. There are two mirrors and two strings of jewels or beads. Mirrors and strings of magatama, or " curved jewels," together with sacred swords, make up the well known triad of the most potent and most highly exalted magical ob- jects known to ancient Japanese rites. The Mlirror. The two Idzushi mirrors were Kami. This is by no means unique in early Shint6. The Nihongi and the Kojiki preserve ac- counts of the famous story of the retirement of the Sun Goddess to the Rock-cave of Heaven and her enticement therefrom in an elaborate cere- mony that included as its central element the holding of a mirror before the cave entrance. The story reflects primitive rites for restoring the darkened sun after some sort of obscuration, perhaps by storm clouds, 51) E, The Chronicle of Old Events.

This mirror, which later passed into the possess- ion of the Royal Ancestors, became one of the three regalia emblems. Handed on for a long period in the direct personal oversight of successive generations of Emperors, it was eventually enshrined at the Grand Im- perial Shrine of Ise and is today the most deeply venerated of all the material objects of Shinto. Its replica is employed in the enthronement ceremonies of new sovereigns. The Kojiki says explicitly that the original mirror used in the sun- restoring ceremony was kami. The participants in the rites before the cave are depicted as rejoicing and making merry because the mirror which they had in their possession was " a Kami more illustrious " even than the Sun Goddess herself.54) The idea that the regalia mirror was once be- lieved to possess magical protective powers in regard to the person of the ruler is expressly stated in the Kogoshuii. This document in speaking of the replicas of the mirror and the sword which were made for the im- mediate possession of the Emperor after the originals had been given perma- nent shelter in specially constructed shrines, says regarding the replicas: The new mirror and sword are the identical emblems which the Imbe familyk5) offer to the Emperor as the divine insignia at his enthronement cere- mony, which protect the legitimate sovereign against hostile evil powers.56) Other sources attribute a kami-nature to mirrors. The Dai jingu- Sankeiki57) (" Diary of a Pilgrimage to the Grand Shrine of Ise ") by Tsfikai58) mentions a sanctuary called the Koasama Shrine where two mirrors were worshipped as Kami. The author says: These two mirrors are special Kani. . . . These mirrors are Kami that exert a ceaseless miraculous power.59) The kami-force resident in mirrors manifested itself in their strange power to drive away the demons of disease and misfortune. No demon, however invisible to the ordinary sight of man and no matter how success- fully disguised, could conceal himself from the all-seeing eye of the mir- ror. The mirror was a devil-revealer. It had power, also, to abstract the very soul of demonic powers and thus accomplish their destruction.

It says: In Kuji Gun six ri to the northwest, at Higashi Yama of Kawa Uchi villaae, there is a mirror rock. In ancient times evil spirits existed here; and when they gathered near and sported about and saw the mirror they would straightway flee. In common usage it is said " The sickened demon perishes in front of a mirror."60) Kato cites a passage from the Chinese writer H6bokushi61) in which the statement is made that in ancient times all persons entering mountains for religious seclusion62) carried nine inch mirrors on their backs between their shoulders in order to prevent demons from drawing too near to them. The fact of the existence of this practice and its underlying ideas undoubt- edly furnishes the explanation of the elevation of mirrors on ships when undertaking dangerous voyages. In such cases the mirror was a passage- charm. It is from this point of view that we are to understand the mean- ing of the " mirror of the offing " and the " mirror of the shore " which Ama-no-Hiboko brought over from Korea.63) The Nihongi says that a great mirror was hung upon the ship of Prince Yamato-Takeru-no-Mikoto when he undertook a hazardous expedition against the Ainu in 110 A.D.64) The rational interpretation of the magical kami-power of the mirror is to be sought in the mystery that the reflected image presented to pre- scientific man. When he saw his own face and form in the depths of still water or within the surface of a mirror he had no other explanation of the marvel than to conclude that somehow his own spirit had been strangely abstracted frorm his body. We may infer that this substratum of ancient folklore underlies the Nihongi story of the peculiar sanctity of the mirror which was conferred on the offspring of the Sun Goddess when the former was sent down from Takamna-ga-Hara to take possession of the territory that was to become the Japanese Empire: At this time Amaterasu-Omi-Kami took in her hand the precious mirror, and, giving it to Ame-no-Oshiho-MUimi-no-Mikbto, uttered a prayer, saying:-" My child, when thou lookest upon this mirror, let it be as if thou wert looking on me. Let it be with thee on thy couch and in thy hall, and let it be to thee a holy mirror."63) 60) Ibid., p. 126. 61) [jtTF--. Flourished about 280 A.

Holtom 370 When this commission failed to achieve the desired ends, the Imperial Grandson, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, was dispatched with the solemn charge: Regard this mirror exactly as if it were our August Spirit and reve- rence it as if worshipping before US.66) In summary of this section we may draw the conclusion that the mir- ror was included in the kami-world of the ancient Japanese people because, by the direct evidence of their senses, it possessed a miraculous potency to draw souls and spirits into itself and preserve them there. It was pre- eminently an instrument that was strangely endowed with occult power, and therefore kami. Jewels and Strings of Beads. Included in the Idzushi Kami were also two strings of beads. Even more illustrious treasures than these, however, are found in the kami-beads that were given by Izanagi to the Sun Goddess when he conferred on her dominion over Takama-ga-Hara. The Kojiki account of this transaction reflects a very ancient rite by which authority was transferred from ruler to ruler, certified by visible insignia, and protected by a super-human power. At the climnax of their creative activities the Sky Father and the Earth M1other, Izanagi and Izanami, brought into being the storm god, the moon god, and the goddess of the sun. The Kojiki continues: At this time His Augustness the Male-Who-Invited (Izanagi-no-Mikoto) greatly rejoiced, saying: " I begetting child after child, have at my final begetting gotten three illustrious children," (with which words) at once jinglingly taking off and shaking the jewel-string forming his august necklace, he bestowed it on the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity (Amaterasu-Omikamni), saying: " Do Thine Augustness rule the Plain-of-High-Heaven (Takama-ga-Hara)." With this charge he bestowed it on her. Now the name of his august necklace was the August- Storehouse-Shelf-Kami (AMikura-Tana-no-Kami).67) This necklace is plainly nothing other than a string of the magatama or " curved jewvels " so well known to early Japanese culture. They were made of various substances such as agate, jasper, chalcedony, topaz, ameth3Tst, jade, amber, pagodite, serpentine, steatite talc, baked clay, fossil wood, porcelain, glass, and even rarely of copper and gold or copper and silver. Their morphological and magical prototype has been found in the claws of the tiger and the bear, perhaps in a moon representation. Some of the early magatama strangely resemble the crescent moon in shape. Magatama were worn about the neck by the people of old Japan partly 66) Chamberlain, Kojiki, p. 131. 67) Op. cit., p. 51.

In the Kojiki account which we have just examined they were, as already indicated, also the certification of the right to rule.68) Attention has already been called to the magical powers of the four jewels of tama which Nigi-Hayahi sent down from Takama-ga-Hara in the care of his son. One of these preserved life, one guarded health, one turned back the demons of disease and pestilence that sought entrance to the habitations of men over the roads, and one possessed the extraord- inary power of restoring life to the dead. We are probably not wrong in inferring that the two strings of beads among the Idzushi Kami origin- ally had similar mysterious functions. The Nihongi mentions two mirac- ulous tama, one called a " tide-flowing-jewel," the other, a " tide-ebbing- jewel." The former when shaken over the ocean would cause the tide to flow in, the other, to flow out.69) In the Kojiki we find the story of a red jewel that was miraculously transformed into a beautiful maiden. This jewel wvas " deified " at an ancient shrine and worshipped under the name of Akaru-Hime, " Radi- ant-Princess.' '70) The explanation of the extraordinary power that was attributed to jewels has already been suggested. They were filled with kami-force and utilized as the potent agencies of sympathetic magic because they stood for the claws of wild animals or else the crescent moon with its strange capacity to increase in size day by day. In ancient Korea the claws of the tiger were worn as charms. As will be seen below, the Japan- ese who came in contact with the tiger of Korea called it kami. The female medium of the Liichui Islands still wears magatama about her neck. Swords and Spears. The Kojiki list of the Eight Great Kami of Idzu- shi does not include swords. The Nihongi account does, however. This document says in one place that among the eight Kami was one sword; in another place, two.71) Again, it mentions a " short sword called Idzushi"72) and attributes to it the miraculous power of disappearing spontaneously: 68) Japanese authorities understand the name of the magatama given to the Sun Goddess by her father to signify that they were kept by the Sun Goddess in her storehouse on a high shelf where they would be safe (Shinto Daijiten, III, p. 288). This interpretation follows the meaning of the ideograms with which the name is written. Taking these in the order in which they appear in the title, they stand for: an honorific, storehouse, board or shelf, to raise up, the genetive particle, and kami. 69) Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 94. 70) Chamberlain, Kojiki, pp. 313-315. 71) Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, pp. 168-169. 72) Ibid., p. 185.</page><page sequence="22">46 D. C. Holtom 372 Afterwards the Idzushi short sword wZnt of its own accord to the Island of Ahaji, where the people of the island considered it a Kami and erected for the short sword a shrine, in which it is worshipped until this day [record for the year 59 A.D.]. -) Like the ancient Greeks and Germans, as well as people elsewhere, the early Japanese " deified " their swords and gave them kami-names. The sword which subdued the savage deities of Kumano was called Thrust-Strike-Kami (Sashi-Futsu-no-Kami).74) The marvelous sword of the Sky Father with which he killed a Drought Child is called Majestic- Point-Blade-Extended-Kami (Itsu-no- Wo-Habari-no-Kami). A variant title is Ame-no-Wo-Habari-no-Kami the (Point-Blade-Extended-Kami- of-Heaven).75) Sanctuaries were dedicated to famous swords, where they wvere en- shrined as Kami. The great shrine of Atsuta in the province of Owari shelters the marvelous regalia sword which according to legend was taken from the tail of a storm-serpent by Susa-no-Wo, the storm god. Many stories are told of the occult power that resided in this sword. One of the Nihongi versions (record for 110 A.D.) of the struggle between Prince Yamato-Takeru-no-Mikoto and a band of brigands on the Suruga moor states that in the fight the sword miraculously wielded itself and mowed away the herbage about the Prince and thus saved his life by pre- venting a fire that had been kindled against him from reaching his per- son.76) The sword cursed the Emperor Temmu and brought an incurable disease upon him.77) The Nihongi record for 668 A.D. says that in this year the Buddhist priest Dokyo stole the sword from the Atsuta shrine and attempted to escape with it to Korea, but the supernatural power of the sword so perplexed him with storm while on his way that he was forced to abandon his evil scheme, turn back, and deliver himself up for execution.78) Explanation of the attribution of a kami-nature to swords is probably not referable to a single cause. It is not difficult to understand how a sword that has saved life, destroyed enemies, and performed other mar- velous deeds, or one that is very pld, tends to be regarded as a living be- ing, full of strange, protective power, and therefore kami. It becomes the very " soul " of the warrior and is thus spoken of in Japanese literature. 73) Ibid., p. 186. 74) Chamberlain, Kojiki, p. 135. 75) Ibid., pp. 34, 100. 76) Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 205. 77) Ibid., Vol. II, p. 377. 78) Ibid., Vol. II, p. 204.</page><page sequence="23">373 The Meaning of Kami 47 In addition, the Japanese tradition preserves a knowledge of an early associ- ation between certain marvelous swords and lightning. The wondrous sword, called Majestic-Point-Blade-Extended-Kami with which Izanagi killed the Drought Child is, by the best of evidence, nothing other than the lightning that flashed terribly in the sky. The Kojiki represents this sword as the father of the thunder god, Take-Mikadzuchi-no-Wo-no-Kami -the Fierce-Thunder-Male-Kami.79) From the same sword were born other Kami of " swift-fire " and storm. One of the Nihongi variant accounts states that from the body of the slain Drought Child came thunder and rain.80) The connection of the episode with a thunder storm is obvious. This depiction of lightning as a terrible sword is something more than mere metaphore. The Nihongi says that the fire that falls from heaven enters into " rocks, trees, and herbage."81) The extraction of this heaven-fire by the friction of wood or by striking stones together was visible evidence that they had been impregnated with lightning. A weapon made from flint carried this marvelous power, and the suggest- ion is made for what it is worth that this early association is one of the contributing factors in creating the idea that there was a kami-power re- sident in swords. The Idzushi sword with which this section of the discussion began was made of stone.82) Each of the two lists which the Nihongi gives of the Idzushi mentions a spear. It is probable that these weapons also were made of stone.83) At the Oyamato Shrine of the modern Hyogo Prefecture and at the Mishima Shrine of the Province of Iyo in Shikoku the local Kami were believed to have their residence in spears. In the latter case the spear itself was called Koko-Gami, or Spear-Kami. Kato in his study of early Japanese fetishism states that these spears were deified and worshipped as shintai, or Kami-objects. He says, " These were not merely marvelous objects that were possessed of kami-power, but they had passed beyond the borders of fetishism and were elevated to the ranks of gods."84) Animals The Wolf. Fearful and uncanny animals were called kami. The ordinary word for wolf, in common use in the modern Japanese language is still okami, and although this expression now has its own distinct ideo- 79) Ibid., Vol. I, p. 17. 80) Ibid., Vol. I, p. 20. 81) Ibid., Vol. I, p. 29. 82) Ibid., Vol. I, pp. 168, 169, 185. 83) Ibid., Vol. I, 168, note 3. 84) Kato, Genchi, ShintJ no Shakyo Hattatsushi teki Kenkya, p. 131.</page><page sequence="24">48 D.

Holtom 374 gram,85) it is evidently nothing other than " Great Kami,"86) and may not without good reason be understood to have had its origin in emotions of weirdness and fear which were stimulated in the breasts of the early ancestors when they came into contact with this creature. The Nihongi in its record for the year 539 A.D. mentions two mountain wolves that were called Awesome Kami (Kashikoki Kami).87) A passage of the Yamato Fudoki says: In ancient times in the land of Asuka there was an old wolf that had eaten many people. The peasants of the district feared it and called it the Great- Mouthed-Kami (Oguchi-no-Kami).88) In the Manyoshui the wolf is called Great-Mouthed-True-Kami (Oguchi-Magami),89) or the Kami with the wide open mouth. The mes- senger of the mountain shrine of Mimine in Musashino is the wolf. These animals are said to have been numerous in the mountain in ancient times. In this case the wolf has now taken on a protective function over the af- fairs of men and is depicted with wide open mouth on lintel charms that guard the entrances of homes against evil and sickness. The Tiger. The ancient Japanese people became acquainted with the tiger through cultural and military contacts with Korea. These go back to a remote period in the historical and legendary records. Japan- ese in Korea were subjected.to much danger and injury by this animal and learned to dread it. The tiger appears in the Manyoshui and was regarded as kami. This document mentions " the tiger of Korea which was called kami."90) The Nihongi tells the story of a man named Kashi- wade-no-Omi who, while in Korea, tracked down a tiger that had carried off one of his children. On coming close the lair of this dread creature, the hunter cried out: " Thou art a fearful Kami."91) Serpents. The serpent was likewise kami. In the Hitachi Fudoki these animals are called Yat&amp;no-Kami,92) which Japanese authorities de- clare to be a corruption of Yatsu-no-Kami,93) meaning Kami-of-Dales.

If anyone casts a glance on them, as he sometimes does, it will be the ruin of his family, and his posterity will cease to succeed.94) The problem was solved by establishing a clear boundary between the fields of man and the domain of the Snake-Kami and erecting a shrine for their worship. The owner of the rice fields addresses the serpents with the prayer: " I beseech you to bring no curse on us nor bear any grudge against us." In the notes that accompany their English edition of the Hitachi Fudoki, recently published, Kono Shozo and Sakai Atsuhara remark: The snake is called Kami here because objectively it is the thing to be feared in a dale. The word Kami by the way, designates anything that is awful, irre- spective of the shape or appearance of the object.9S) In tne Nihongi, Susa-no-Wo-no-Mikoto addressed the serpent that devoured the Maidens of Aki with the words: "Thou art an Awful Kami."96) The same book introduces us to the Kami of Mimoro Moun- tain, which took the form of a great serpent. " Its thunder rolled, and its eyeballs flamed." After capture it was let loose again on the mountain and given the name Ikadzuchi-Thunder.97) The Kami of Mount Ibuki in Afumi that blocked the road of Prince Yamato-Takeru-no-Mikoto, likewise took on the form of a great serpent.95) White Animals Various kinds of white animals are regarded as supernatural portents, good omens, or as messengers of the gods, and are sometimes called kami. The Japanese practice in this respect finds a parallel in the meaning of the Malay term kramat which in one part of its manifold content included animals that exhibited albinism. In both fields it is undoubtedly true that the psychological origin of the usage must be referred to the extra- ordinary aspect of white animals by which feelings of weirdness and awe, and thus ideas of unique significance, were stimulated in the beholders.99) 94) Hitachi Fudoki, edited with notes by Kono Shoz6 and translated into English. by Sakai Atsuhara, Cultural Nippon, Vol. VIII, No. 3, Oct., 1940, p. 141. 95) Ibid. 96) jf4jr, Cf.

Other Objects and Events of Nature Thunder The ordinary word for thunder in the Japanese language is kaminari, that is, kami-sound. A haminariyoke is a charm against lightning. Kami- nari ni utarete shinu means to be struck dead by lightning. The thunder god was sometimes called Taka-tsu-Kami, or Kami-on-High, and to be struck by lightning was a curse or calamity visited on man by this god.'07) The most well-known designation for the thunder god is Take-Maka- Dzuchi-no-Wo-no-Kami, which probably means Fierce-Awful-Hammer- Male-Kami. Mountains anzd Other Phenomena The Manyoshii speaks of Mount Fuji as kami. A well known pass- age from this collection of poems reads,: Ayashiku mo imasu Kami ka mo; Yamato no kuni no shizume to mo imasu Kami ka mo; Taka to nareru yama ka mo.1"8S This may be rendered: Oh mountain that sittest an awe inspiring Kami; . .. . . . .... * . . . . .*.* * * .***- ** *. * 8. . *. . . . .. *... * . . Oh thou Kami that sittest as the guardian of the Yamato Land Oh precious mountain, thou. In his commentary on this stanza Tanaka Jigohei says that M\ount Fuji is here spoken of as a Kami because she is continuously breathing out smoke and because of the loveliness of her form.11"9) In other words, the sense of mystery and the expansive emotion stimulated by the mani- festation of overpowering beauty were projected into the external world to become the grounds on which the presence of a kami-activity in the mountain was affirmed. The Manyoshui speaks of Mount Mimuro, mentioned above in connection wit hserpent-kami, as Kami-Oka (" Kami-Hill "). It was also 107) Cf.

[Tsugita Jun --A:MM, Mlany5shk Shinko fXZXXM,-- New Exposition of the Manyoshui "-pp. 112-113, Toky6, 1926]. The wind that blows from the sacred shrine of WVatarahi [Grand Shrine of Ise] is Kamu-Kaze or Kan-Kaze (" Kami-Wind "). [Idid., pp. 77, 140, 146]. The words of the Shinto priest which had power to effect the safe passage of the ships in the Bay of Sumi are called Kamu-Goto or Kan-Goto (" Kami-Words ") [Manyoshu, No. 4243]. In his recently published study of the " Concept of Kami in the Maiiay5shli," Dr. Hisamatsu Sen-ichi makes the following statements which are pertinent to the general import of our study: In cases where the word kami is combined with such words as yama (moun- tain), shnma (island), oka (hill), saki (cape, headland), etc., wve can perceive the mentw&gt;l attitude of the people who looked upon the mountains, islands, or capes as kamni. People often thought of some old or large trees as kami; hence the words, kam-ki (god-tree) and kam-sugi (god-cedar). As is seen in the Fudoki )iE? M, this idea is a manifestation of people's belief with regard to huge trees. In the Izinno Fudoki IB!R?_ the wvord kam-yu TOM'i, (god-hot-spring) is found, the name being given in recognition of the miraculous efficacy of a hot-spring. It is per- ceivable that they felt a divine power in strong or miraculous things. [Cultural Nippon, Vol. VIII, No. 4, Winter Number, Dec., 1940, p. 44]. The above discussion supplies us with data on which we may venture an interpretation of the original psychological motivation of the various material objects, or shiintail'-'&lt;(" god-bodies "), that are preserved as sacred relics in the inner sanctuaries of all Shint6 shrines. Each shrine houses at least one such object; generally there are as many in each place as the number of deities locally worshipped. The early and purely Japanese designation for such an object is kamu-sane or kan-zane, " kami-seed," or " kami-kernel." The name covers a wide variety of form and sub- stance : mirrors, swvords, spears, jewels (magatama), old scrolls, sacred texts, stones, sometimes phallic emblems or human hair, old iron pots used for making salt (Shiogama Shrine), purification wvands; weapons, articles of clothing, or other intimate personal possessions of great and powerful men; and sometimes natural objects like mountains (Omiwa Shrine), trees, and hot-springs (Yudono in Yamagata Prefecture). In the case of large natural phenomena like mountains, the object itself is the original shrine and later a special sanctuary is dedicated to its spirit or god. The list just given is only partial, but taken into consideration with the material that we have already passed in review, may suffice to, 110) fira. Cf. Shinto Daijiten, Vol. II, p. 276.</page><page sequence="29">379 The Meaning of Kami 53 warrant the observation that all such objects probably received their ini- tial selection and dedication because of mysterious, wonder-working kami- power resident in them. They became " god-bodies " because they were filled with mana. The weapons and clothing of the great warrior have ab- sorbed his peculiar power and, by the laws of contact magic, can transfer that power to others. Mountains, trees, mirrors, swords, jewels, phallic emblems, etc., are all impregnated with mysterious kami-force. Sub- sequent ages have interpreted these " god-bodies " as symbols of the Kami or as great treasures handed down out of the remote past, but originally they are implements of magic or sources of occult power. Legitimate Deities The study of the meaning of kami finds its most extensive and at the same time most difficult field of research in the vast array of legitimate deities which Old Shinto presents in overwhelmingly complicated pro- portions. Adequate exploration of the origin, history and function of each one of the gods and goddesses of the early literature would mean years of investigation and even then could yield only tentative results in numerous cases. The original and correct meanings of the names of many of the gods and goddesses listed in the Kojiki, Nihongi, Kujiki, Kogoshzui, and Engishiki are lost beyond recovery; their functions are often unstated or obscure; the documents just named are frequently irreconcil- able with each other and sometimes internal confusion exists in one and the same writing. Under the circumstances, the task of compiling the history of the Japanese gods takes on truly herculean proportions. For- tunately even an approximation to such an accomplishment is not essent- ial to the purposes of the present essay. We are interested in trying to make clear to ourselves the general meaning of kami, not in the specialized history of all the gods and goddesses. It may be counted sufficient to our needs if we can lay before our minds major classes and trends in mean- ing, and the process whereby the more diffuse and primitive sense of kami as an awesome occult power became individualized in superhuman beings that are invested with will and moral character. This means that legitimate deities in early Shinto, as elsewhere, are conceived of as beneficent superhuman beings that exercise power over nature and man. In general, these beings in their early forms, are de- finitized and personalized aspects of the natural world which somehow have been brought into close intimacy with man. They are specialized manifestations of good will resident in the mysterious outside world; and on them man feels himself dependent for well-being and towards them he senses a profound gratitude. ' Superhuman " here means above and</page><page sequence="30">54 D. C. Holtom 380 beyond the resources of ordinary human control and contact. The pro- cedures of common daily living cannot be relied upon to break through the taboo of that which is emotionally sensed as " holy." Superhuman, then, finds its objective reference in those phases of experience which are mysterious and awesome, filled with dangerous and extraordinary power that can only be approached and appropriated to the meeting of human need through the special technique of religious rite and ceremony. The question that is raised for us here theni is : Flow has the original kami-idea of awesome, occult power become individualized and identified with the good will of a personal god ? In answer, it may be said that manifestly before this specialized relationship or emotionally founded interpretation can be established there must be a recurrent impression of goodness in some definite phase of early experience. This sense of the goodness and beneficence of some of the powers of the early environment arises as the inevitable and spontaneous projection of human gratitude in the presence of the adversities and vicissitudes in a perilous struggle for existence. It is the registration of the measure of the sense of relief and security that has been achieved in a world filled with danger, want and frustration. After the struggle with beast and man, cold and storm, de- monic power and sickness, have come healing, shelter and protection; after the famine, food. Kindly and mysterious forces have driven away the pestilence, restored health, shielded against danger, broken the drought, caused the plant to grow and set forth food and drink. Some good power, some mighty friend who looks after man in his need, must have helped him; and just as the M1elanesian believed that his victory in battle, the fertility of his fields and domestic animals, the swiftness of the canoe that carried him to safety, or the skill of the weapon that averted death, were due to mana, so early man in general, in his deep emotional expansion of relief at deliverance turned in gratitude to agencies outside himself and built up his majestic world of supernatural friends."1) Marett is undoubtedly correct, however, when he suggests that ante- cedent to this sense of superhuman goodness on which early man felt himself dependent, was the sense of mysterious power: " the notion of the divine power would seem to be historically prior to that of the divine goodness, whether displayed as justice or love."i12) Thunder, lightning, the storm, the sea, the earthquake, as well as the mountain, the river, the sun, the moon, the earth and the sky, were all Kami in old Shinto, and the very nature of these original experiences themselves is such as to war- I 111) Cf. Haydon, A. Eustace, Man's Search for the Good Life, pp. 164-165. 112) Marett. R. R., Art. " Mana," op. cit., p. 771.</page><page sequence="31">381 The Meaning of Kami 55 rant the conclusion that primary in these kami-classifications must have been the sense of great and mysterious power. The lightning flashing in the sky, the thunder rolling in the clouds, the storm roaring through the air, the sea raging on the shore or moving, mysteriously in the tides, the stream flowing strangely on its course-all of these and many similar events were first of all manifestations of mysterious divine power. But this appearance of power does not in and of itself make a legitimate god. It may make a demon or devil as well. The early Japanese appeased various fear-inspiring Kami that were believed to have power to inflict curses and evil, but these are not true gods. It is only when the man- kami relationship has in it the possibility of dependency for goodness that the true god emerges. In addition, this manifestation must be localized in a distinct object or phenomenon, and human association therewith must have been sufficiently recurrent and constant to make possible the growth of the sense of dependability and permanency in the relationship. It remains to bring these general remarks into more direct contact with the early Japanese god-world. It will be recalled that in an earlier portion of the discussion the opin- ion of Dr. Saeki Ariyoshi regarding the method by which the nature of the deities of early Shinto might best be elucidated was introduCed. He says that the "Registry of Shinto Shrines" (the Shimmyocho) of the Engishiki should be consulted in order to ascertain the shrines that were honored when this document was compiled. This would furnish the student with the names of the official shrines that flourished in the first part of the tenth century A.D., and reference to other historical material would show that large numbers of these had their origins in a much earlier period. In some cases the names of deities worshipped in the Engishiki ceremonies are listed in the Shimmy5cho ; in most instances, however, only the shrines are given. The task of determining the names of the deity or deities honored at any given shrine is facilitated greatly by the publication of an indispensable work intitled " A Survey of the Shrines " (JiUja Daikan),'13) issued since Dr. Saeki wrote his study of kami. This new work gives the names of all important Shinto shrines, the deities to which they are dedicated, and historical notes necessary to promoting the investigation. The proportion of the opportunity here open to the stud- ent is suggested by the fact that the Shimmyocho of the Engishiki lists 3,132 officially recognized shrines that would require examination. Dr. Saeki further suggests that, having ascertained the names of the deities 113) j1- M,: Tokyo 1936.</page><page sequence="32">56 D. C. Holtom 382 recognized in the Engishiki registry, the early classics like the Kojiki and the N\ihongi should be consulted for the traditions that existed regarding the Kami, and at the same time the rituals of the Engishiki should be studied for the beliefs that were current regarding them. To explore the details of the wide field here laid before us and formulate the results of such re- search in a manner that could be presented to the Western world would, in and of itself, constitute practically a life work for any one man. A preliminary examination of this material, even though presented as a few cups of water out of a great ocean, yet may make possible the securing of data which, while severely limited, are believed to be sufficiently repre- sentative to satisfy the purposes of the present study. When we remember that the Engishiki rituals were used, in part at least, for ceremonies conducted at all the official shrines, it will be seen that a full list of the deities worshipped must exhaust the register of im- portant enshrinements. We must content ourselves with a very much less ambitious program than this. The most significant deities propitiated or mentioned in the -rituals or honored at the shrines of the Shimmy6cho catalogue included: all of the ancestors of the reigning Emperor, parti- cularly the Great Ancestress, Amaterasu-Omikami, Yamato-Takeru-no- Mikoto (81-113 A.D.), the most famous warrior-hero of ancient Japan, Chuiai Tenno (192-200 A.D.) and Nintoku Tenno (313-399 A.D.); the Food Goddess of the Outer Shrine of Ise, worshipped there and elsewhere in numerous shrines under many names; the two Kami of creation and growth mentioned in the opening paragraph of the Kojiki; the gods of thunder and of lightning, personified as the patron divinities of warriors; the fire god; the irrigation Kami who " sit at the water-divide," that is, the place where water was distributed to the rice fields; timber gods " who sit at the entrances to the mountains " and who provide the materials for human habitations; the gods that preside over arable land; wind gods that ruled the fate of the standing grain; the Great God of Idzumo, who is perhaps an amalgamation of a very ancient god of the soil and a dimly remembered culture hero; the guardian Kami of localities; the Barrier- Kami who kept away pestilence and other forms of demonic evil; and various household Kami that presided over gateways, home entrances, courtyards, wells, the hearth and its utensils. To these we may add the deities of rain, the moon, the storm, mountains, sea, sky and earth. This summary, brief as it is, must be considered sufficient for our needs. Japanese writers with almost complete unanimity divide the pan- theon into two great divisions: man-gods and nature-gods. Non-Japan- ese writers commonly follow in the same way.114) Shinto is thus some- 114) For example, see Aston, Shint: The Way of the Gods, pp. 121-199.</page><page sequence="33">383 The Meaning of Kami 57 times defined as an amalgamation of ancestor worship and nature wor- ship. It will be recalled that Dr. Saeki in drawing conclusions regarding the early Kami, founded on his study of the early texts, reiterates this classification and declares that in the total ancient god-world ancestral deities were most numerous, but that nature deities were also worshipped. In the summary of outstanding legitimate Kami that has been outlined above these two main divisions are implied. Some of the Kami honored in the Enigishiki rituals were plainly authentic ancestors of the race, and in particular the great ancestors of the reigning Sovereign. Others are plainly nature deities. The question that Dr. Saeki raises regarding the relative proportion of these two kinds of Kami in early Shinto is one of peculiar difficulty, but cannot now be investigated methodically. Suffice it to say here that the farther back we go in tracing the genesis of the members of the very early Shinto god-world, the more clearly evident it becomes that we are entering ever more deeply into a region in which the relative preponderance that must be given to nature worship constantly increases. Shint6 is no exception to the general rule that the gods in their earliest forms are aspects of nature that have been brought into friendly relations with man and characterized in anthropomorphic terms.l5l) This is not to minimize a further important factor, however. From the point of view of the psychological reactions of pre-scientific man, there is always a mana-element in an extraordinary person. Power, majesty, unusual skill, shrewdness, wisdom, and strength are supernatural endowments. In the Japanese culture these " superior " men are Kami. Not all men are Kami, or possess kami-power however, but only those who by their manifestation of marvelous power or " virtue " stimulate emotions of wonder and awe in those who come into contact with them. In this respect extraordinary men do not differ from the extraordinary phenomena of nature. From both alike emanate super-ordinary, myst- erious influences. We are thus dealing here not with a duality of nature- worship and man-worship, but with a single over-world of marvelous, extraordinary power manifested in certain men and certain objects and events. This immediately gives unity to the so-called two-fold aspects of the religious life of the ancient Japanese people. The Old Shinto religious life does not find its source in two distinct streams that have flowed into one. The reverse process has taken place; a single stream of kami-power, manifested in various events, objects and personages that are spontaneously unified by the " sacred " emotions which they evoke, 115) Cf. Haydon, op. cit.</page><page sequence="34">58 D. C. Holtom 384 has been later interpreted as two-fold. Furthermore, it is inevitable that the early Japanese in their attempts to give rational formulation to the undifferentiated man-nature content of the kami-world, should set up kinship relations between the various elements therein and thus account for the presence of the human elements in terms of the most obvious and intimate of their own association experiences, that is, the genealogical. Nature forces thus become human ancestors. rThe people who created the traditions of the early Japanese literature did not invent or consciously construct their tendency to find ancestors among the nature Kami. As they emerged from an even more remote cultural stage, they found themselves already in possession of an over- world of man-nature Kami, inseparably concatenated witnin itself as the projection of instinctive emotional reactions to the manifestation of myst- erious power. This fundamental psychotogical characteristic of man has had profound influence on the social and political evolution of all ancient societies, notably so in Japan. It has made possible the stabili- zation of government on the foundations of divine right and inviolable authority, and as long as capacities for faith and belief survive in the people, it must continue to be the chief bulwark of the state. Eminent and powerful members of society are immediately and spontaneously elevated to the kami-status, surrounded with taboo, and sanctified with intense emotions of awe. Membership in the mighty kami-society thus becomes the authorization of the right to rule. This is the primary truth that Marett has in mind when he says-as already cited-that mana stands for the divine right of the aristocratic class to wield authority and to enforce religious prohibitions; the sanction behind the taboo being the mana of the governing class."'16) This fundamental observation probably states the most prominent characteristic of so-called early Japanese " ancestor worship," and assists us in understanding how nature gods can become human ancestors. To this underlying tendency and fact of the early social life, created and made possible by the very nature of the emotions themselves, may be added a speculative tendency. That is to say, relationships in and with the god-world are elaborated partially as an attempt to account for origins. Great personages among the Kami, regardless of whether or not they were originally nature forces, are magnified as the founders of families and the heads of genealogies. This satisfied the speculative desire to discover adequate beginnings and at the same time enhanced the sense of prestige. But this did not in and of 116) Op. cit., p. 770.</page><page sequence="35">385 The Meaning of Kami 59 itself create the tendency to discover human ancestors among the nature Kami. For the roots of this tendency we must look-as attempted above -to more profound depths of human nature. An examination of the names of the Kami throws a certain amount of light on the process by which the original kami-emotion has projectedt itself into the creation of definite superhuman beings. In general, these names are attributive modifiers that indicate main characteristics or out- standing properties or forms of activity; in other words, brief statements of the primary functions or the modes of expression that impressed the early Japanese people in their relations with specific embodiments of wonder-working, mysterious power. In numerous cases the name is merely a brief description of the object or agency in which the kami-power is localized. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the underlying idea that is being expressed in the divine title is not that of a pantheistic, all-pervading world-force or spirit-essence manifesting itself in some particular embodiment or activity. It is rather the expression of a spon- taneous emotional response tQ some particular object or event that has stimulated in an outstanding way the feeling of mystery, awe, majesty or power. It has stirred the " religious thrill," thrown the attention into unusual activity and thus become a manifestation of mana or kamni. This emotion when associated with definite phenomena upon which man be- lieves himself dependent for benefits to human life inevitably creates the god. In the case of outstanding phenomena of nature the Kami is first the object or the activity itself and then later a personalized spirit which rules the object and dwells therein, or which controls the manifestation. A few examples may assist in giving greater definiteness to these remarks. Two wind deities are found in early Shinto and are specialized into male and female after the human pattern. Originally they were undoubtedly one and the same, as the Nihongi in fact indicates."'7) They are Shina-tsu-Hiko-no-Kami and Shina-tsu-Hime-no-Kami. Shina is " long-breath," tsu is the generic particle, hiko is " male " or " prince," hime is "female " or " princess," no is again a generic particle. We have then: "Long-breath-Prince-Kami "and " Long-breath-Princess-Kami" as the meaning of the names of these two deities. In the Niliongi the wind is the breath of the Sky Father, Izanagi-no-Kami, which drives away the morning mists."'8) The wind itself is the original Kami. An attempt to identify the mysterious power of the moving air, which is the breath of the universe, obviously has created these titles. The storm god is Take- 117) Aston, NTihongi, Vol. I, p. 22. 118) Ibid.</page><page sequence="36">60 D. C. Holtom 386 Haya-Susa-no-Wo-no-Kami, "The Fierce-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Kami." The might of stormy wind and rain is here described in terms of the viol- ence of a strong man. Dr. Kato Genchi says that this deity is " simply the deification of the rainstorm.""19) The moon god is Tsuki- Yomi-no- Kami, " The Kami with Dominion over Night." One of the well-known deities of growth, fertility and creative power is Taka-Mimusubi-no-Kami, " The High-August-Producing-Kami." The goddess of food has many names: Toyo-Uke-Hime-no-Kami, " Abundant-Food-Princess-Kami;" -Ogetsu-Hime-no-Kami, " Great-Food-Princess-Kami;" Miketsu-no-Kami, "August-Food-Kami;" Uke-no-Mitama-no-Kami, "Food-August- Spirit- -Kami;" and Uke-Mochi-no-Kami, " Food-Possessing-Kami." The sea god is O-Wata-tsu-Mi-no-Kami, " The Great-Ocean-Possessor- Kami or " The Great-Ocean-Body-Kami." The mountain god is 0- Yama-tsu-Mi-no-Kami, " The Great-Mountain-Possessor-Kami " or " The Great-Mountain-Body-Kami." One of the rain gods is Taka-O- Kami-no-Kami, " Fierce-Great-Divine-Kami;" and sometimes simply 0-Kami, " Great-Kami," that is, the well-known, mighty Kami of rain. This last-named form of title is something of an exception to the general rule, however. These few examples are palpably insufficient when measured against the great and complicated array of gods and goddesses that exists in the early pantheon. Few as they are, however, they may suffice to indicate a fact that could be demonstrated at length: the word Kami as the title of a deity cannot properly stand alone in the common usage of Old Shinto. It must be accompanied by an attributive modifier that indicates function. The god is always a particular kind of kami, that is, a specialized manifest- ation of occult power. This fact supports the conclusion that underly- ing the early Japanese god-idea is a projected emotion that is essentially the same as that found in the concept of mana. As has already been pointed out, however, the perception of myste- rious power, while originally calling into existence the conviction that kami-force is present in the inciting experience, does not thereby, in and of itself, create a legitimate god. For this to come to pass there must be added the notion of a providential function operative in the experience. To be worshipped as a god, the kami-power must be construed as in some way an aid to man in meeting the problems of the struggle for existence. Again it is impossible to examine in detail the deities of early Japan- ese belief with the object of determining in what way each Kami was a friend to man. The benefits conferred by the Kami of Old Shinto are 119) Kogoshuii, p. 55, note 4.</page><page sequence="37">387 The Meaning of Kami 61 many and varied and they differ with different deities. We must content ourselves here, however, with an attempt to summarize them for the en- tire field. In a few cases in what follows, the nature of the benevolent activity of particular deities is pointed out, in the hope of giving greater definiteness to the discussion. Examination of the rituals of the Engishiki shows that, in general, the deities of early Shint6 have functions as follows. They bestow eternity and changelessness on the Imperial reign, frustrate enemies and bring prosperity and peace to the land. They grant wide and unified territories to the Sovereign and authenticate and sanctify his right to rule. They give direction and " tranquility " to the departments of the government and to all the counsellors of the Emperor. They inspire loyal and faith- ful service on the part of the princes, officials and people. They protect dwellings against decay, pollutions and night alarms. They control the crops, averting " bad winds and rough waters " according to the merits of man. They also control the rain and the irrigation waters, and are pro- pitiated against both the over-supply of flood and the under-supply of drought. They " rule over food," germinating the seeds and prospering the labors of man with abundant harvests. Thus they give meat and drink to the Sovereign and the nation. They supply the timbers and the other construction materials used in the dwellings of the Ruler and the people. They protect the roads and gateways leading to human habitat- ions aoainst the incoming of demons and pestilence. They carry off and avert defilement and correct the faults and errors of men. For all these benefits the Kami are propitiated with offerings and besought with words of supplication. It is possible within the limits of the present discussion to supple- ment this general summary of the benevolent activities of gods and godd- esses with more specific data in a single direction only. At the very be- ginning of the Shimmyocho of the Engishiki are listed the names of eight Kami that were worshipped in a sanctuary in the ancient Department of Shint6 (Jingikan) as the special protective deities of the Emperor. Their primary significance in Shint6 belief and ritual are thus assured. Their names are introduced in the course of the paragraphs given below. In addition to their function as guardians of the Imperial Person, special attention should be given to the manner in which they are utilized to give rationality and unity to cosmic speculation, and cogency to the system of thought by which the Absolute finds special manifestation in the activities of the Sovereign. The following is translated from the Shint6 Ency- clopaedia:</page><page sequence="38">62 D. C. Holtom 388 The Eight Kami These are the eight Kami that are enshrined in the Imperial Court for the protection of the person of the Emperor. Their worship originated long ago in the Age of the Gods and has continued onward to the reign of the present Em- peror. In the beginning, on the occasion of the descent of the Imperial Grand- son, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, a divine edict was promulgated by Taka-Mimusubi-no- Mikoto declaring: " We will set up the Himorogi-of-Heaven and a Rock-barrier of Heaven wherein to practice religious worship on behalf of my descendants. Do ye, Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto and Futodama-no-Mikoto, take with you the Himo- rogi-of-IHeaven and go down to the Central Land of Reed-Plains. Moreover, ye will there practice religious worship on behalf of my descendants." Then the Imperial Grandson with these two Kami in his train descended (onto the land of Japan). That is to say, Taka-Mimusubi-no-Mikoto in his own person worshipped the deities on behalf of the Imperial Grandson, and the two Kami who followed the Imperial Grandson brought with them the Himorogi and descended upon this land. The beginnings lie in their performance of worship as commanded. After this when Jimmu Tenno ascended the Throne at the Palace of Kashi- wabara, a Himorogi was set up and worship was performed in accordance with the earlier divine command. The eight Kami are: Kami-Musubi-no-Kami [Sacred-Creator-Kami] Taka-Mimusubi-no-Kami [High-August-Creator-Kami] Tama-Tsume-Musubi-no-Kami [Soul-Detaining-Creator-Kami] Iku-Musubi-no-Kami [Life-Giving-Creator-Kami] Taru-Musubi-no-Kami [Health-Giving-Creator-Kami] Omiya-Me-no-Kami [Great-Shrine-Female-Kami] Miketsu-no-Kami [August-Food-Kami] Koto-Shiro-Nushi-no-Kami [Thing-Rule-Master-Kami] (The readings of the names of the Eight Kami are according to the Engishiki). The manifestation of the divine power of these eight Kami includes creation in the natural world, life, the protection of the Royal Court, food and drink, and the guarding of the Imperial Family. Collectively they protect the Imperial Person and give long life to the Emperor. For this reason they were served by ritualists of the Imperial Court. The following interpretation exists regarding the divine power of these Kami The two Kami, Taka-Mimusubi and Kami-Musubi are the names under which Ame-no-Minaka-Nushi-no-Kami [the Absolute God, the Great Life of the Universe] is manifested in the universe. Taka-Mimusubi is the spiritual power that expresses masculine and positive expansion. Kami-Musubi is the spiritual power that expresses feminine and negative concentration. Expansion is active manifestation; concentration is returning to origin. Active manifestation and returning to origin [i.e., centrifugal and centripetal forces]-these are the funda- mental activities of Taka-Mimusubi and Kami-Musubi. Centered in Ame-no- Minaka-Nushi-no-Kami, Taka-Mimusubi operates with a lively extension of his</page><page sequence="39">389 The Meaning of Kami 63 spirit in all directions, while Kami-Musubi operates with a force that is the exact equivalent of this power of extension, in withdrawal to origins. By means of the ceaseless activity of these two Kami all things in the universe are brought into exist- ence and developed. These two Kami are not two, but one. Again, when we examine the divine names of these two Kami, it is seen that if we take away the ta of Taka-Mimusubi, both names become Kami-Musubi; and if we further take away the ka, both become Mi-Musubi. This Mi-Musubi has two meanings. (1) The first is " Soul " (Mi-Musubil20)), meaning the gener- ating and combining of spirit, a bringing to birth and developing. (2) The second is " Three Spirits " (Mi-Musubil2l)), that is, Iku-Musubi, the Life-giving Spirit, Taru-Musubi, the Strength-giving Spirit, and Tama-Tsume-Musubi, the Soul- detaining Spirit. As a matter of fact, however, these two meanings merge into one. That which Spirit has generated, united, brought into being, and developed, are the Three Spirits. Taka-Mimusubi, on the one hand, and Iku-Musubi, Taru- Musubi and Tama-Tsume-Musubi, on the other, have thus the relation of the inner and outer aspects of a single whole. Iku-Musubi means, creation and development; Taru-Musubi expresses com- pletion and arrangement; Tama-Tsume-Musubi indicates unification and govern- ment. All things in the universe, both spirit and matter, are brought into exist- ence by the activities of these Three Spirits; and behind the manifestation of these Three Spirits is always the activity of the Two Spirits, Taka-Mimusubi and Kami- Musubi. The operations of expansion and concentration, of development and contraction, of positive and negative forces, are forms of activity of these Two Spirits; and hereby the operation of the Three Spirits is brought into being; and because of the activity of the Three Spirits, the operation of the Two Spirits exists. Thus the Three Spirits and the Two Spirits are but two aspects of a single whole. The Two Spirits represent the undulatory power of Spirit.l22) The Three Spirits represent the particularized spiritual power of " Soul."1123) This then is spirit and soul. It manifests itself as time, space, spirit, substance, subjectivity, objectivity, cause, effect, and is the ultimate source of the universe. The fmiya124) of Omiya-Me indicates the consciousnessof the Emperor where- by he regards the nation as his shrine.125) Me has the meaning of " bud "126) [i.e., source, center, power o&amp; germination and development]. In regard to all things whatsoever the center of concentration is the bud. Therefore Omiya-Me indi- cates the consciousness of the Emperor in which he looks on the entire national territory as his own shrine and himself as the most important concentration point of the state. The meaning [of Omiya-Me] originates in this [consciousness of the Emperor]. When we look at this activity from the reverse side it is nothing 120) p 121) =iQ. 122) m. 123) Q. 124) 7- 125) Palace or shrine " Great Dwelling." 126) V.</page><page sequence="40">64 D. C. Holtom 390 other that Iku-Tama [i.e., the function of creation and development]. Miketsu is the manifestation of the objective activity of Taru-Tama [i.e., the function of completion and arrangement]. Omiketsu-no-kami has the meaning of the Great Deity of Food. The Emperor looks on the entire country as his Great Shrine, and regards all the food produced throughout the whole country as his own food. At the same time he himself immediately becomes the Great- Food-Kami and bestows food on all the people of the nation. This is the con- sciousness of the Emperor [that is indicated in the idea of Miketsu]. Koto-Shiro-Nushi again signifies the consciousness of the Emperor. The Emperor is an enshrinement and has the whole country as his shrine. He receives everything that grows in the land as his own food and with this food he bestows sustenance on the people of the nation. At the same time there is signified here the consciousness of the Emperor in which he knows all things completely-the things of heaven and the things of earth, the things of this world and the things of the world beyond death, as well as the consciousness in which he rules over the national territority in tranquility. That is to say, he possesses the consciousness of Tama-Musubi [i.e., the function of unification and government]. As given above there are thus Eight Kami, but when we regard the matter from the point of view of the divi ie natures, they become three. That is, Mi- Musubi and Taka-Mimusubi are one Kami; Iku-Musubi, Taru-Musubi, and Tama- Musubi are one Kami; and Omiya-Me, Omiketsu, and Koto-Shiro-Nushi are one Kami. The fact that in ancient times there were only three torii at the Eight- Kami-Shrine [Hasshin Den] is probably owing to this. Furthermore these three Kami as a matter of fact unite in one Kami in the person of Ame-no-Minaka- Nushi-no-Kami. Evil Kami. Not all of the personalized Kami that pass before us in bewildering procession in the pages of the literature of early Shinto are beneficent gods and goddesses. As has already been suggested some are evil and demonic. Before we move on to the conclusion of the whole matter, this aspect of kami should be examined briefly. Motoori Norinaga in speaking of the meaning of " superiority " as a concept for the unification of the diverse content of the term kami said: " Eminence does not here refer to the superiority of nobility, goodness, or meritorious deeds. Evil and mysterious things, if they are extraordin- ary and dreadful, are called kami." Chief among the evil powers of the early Japanese world-view are two malicious beings which are given mythological origin in a story of their birth from the washed-off filth which Izanagi contracted in his journey to Hades. The Kojiki says that the names of the pair were Mysterious-Kami-of-Eighty-Evils (Yaso-Maga- tsu-Bi-no-Kami)127) and Mysterious-Kami-of-Great-Evils (O-Maga-tsu- 127) AtfiffiEJ I. Also written /-tigtE IR H f</page><page sequence="41">391 The Meaning of Kami 65 Bi-no-Kami).'28) The two may be taken as variant names for one and the same underlying experience. The myth of their origin is undoubtedly a rationalization of a pre-existing and wide-spread belief current in the ancient Japanese folkways. The Malignant Kami are the projection of a primitive fear of disease and pestilence which came to man as a myster- ious visitation out of Hell, the abode of death. Regarding this matter, Dr. Kato says: Sickness, particularly pestilence, to the simple-minded people of ancient Japan, was a calamity inflicted upon them through evil influences of unseen pow- ers. It was imagined as being sent by the Evil Deity, O-Maga-tsu-Bi, the Japan- ese Ahriman. People must be careful of being cleared of it. Thus they had in consequence the great purification ceremony.129) Further Japanese authority confirms this opinion: The Kami is thus named [Mysterious-Kami-of Evil] because the source of all the fiendishness and wickedness of the world arises in the activity of the mysterious spirit of Maga-tsu-Hi-no-Kami.130) Other evil Kami of lesser degree appear here and there in the literat- ure. The Nihongi in its chronicle for the year 110 A.D. says that the mountains of the " eastern savages " are inhabited by " malignant Kami," and couples them with malicious demons that beset the highways and bar the roads.l31) In immediate connection the same evil powers are called violent Kami."132) Conclusions need not be long drawn out. They have already been anticipated and even partially stated in what has gone before. A term that infolds in its varied content the phallus, the kteis; magic scarfs, mirr- ors, swords, spears, and jewels; awe-inspiring animals like the wolf, the tiger, and the serpent; mountains and seas; evil and demonic agencies; spirits; the souls of the dead; majestic and powerful personages among the living ; and a great host of legitimate gods and goddesses-such a term cannot be translated with an approximation to accuracy by the Englishword "god "oreven by "deity." Kami in its original setting and genesis is the projection of an emotion that was aroused by a multitude of widely differing events in the primitive environment, and as has been 128) 17t El Firi*. Also written R EIl 3.The ShintoDaijiten, vol.III,p.365and vol. I, p. 248 explains the meaning of the elements of these two names thus: maga in the sense of wazawai, " evil," or " misfortune ;" yaso, " eighty ," that is, " many; " o, " great, " that is the excessiveness of the evil; hi, " mysterious spirit." 129) Kato, Genchi, A Study of Shinto: The Religion of the Japanese Nation, p. 114.. 130) Shinto Daijiten, Vol. III, p. 365. 131) Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, p. 203. 132) Ibid., p. 204.</page><page sequence="42">66 D. C. Holtom 392 reiterated in the course of the preceding discussion, the intensity and uniqueness of this emotion are the grounds on which an adequate cause of the emotion is inferred to exist in the stimulating object or person or event. Modern man in his effort to analyze and account for this funda- mental fact of the inner life of his pre-scientific brothers, describes the emotion variously as a feeling of awe, strangeness, incomprehensibility, weirdness, horror, demonic dread, or religious dread; as the sense of the eerie, or of the mysterium tremendum ; of that which is " numinous," or giving rise to pre-rational sense of the holy; as the sense of Scheu and of that which is monosugoi; as an awareness of the presence of majesty or of occult power; and, again, as the feeling of the strange fascination and "loveliness " that lay in experiences that made primitive man, at the same time, tremble with dread. All this is modern terminology and catalogu- ing. Pre-literate man believed that in all the different events that evoked the emotions thus described, his own spirit was being played upon by the power of mana, and this was his single unifying concept. This is the primitive psychology that called the Japanese term kami into existence. Kami, like mana, is fundamentally a word that distin- guishes between a " holy " or " sacred " world of separate events, believ- ed to be filled with mysterious power, and under certain conditions with benevolence. This over-world could be controlled safely only with the methods either of magic or religious ritual and prayer. Below this was a profane world of everyday things that could be freely approached and handled with the ordinary methods of the folkways. Through the com- pelling influence of this deep-going human characteristic, man, in the course of the moral evolution of the centuries, has built up his higher work of loyalty and love, and this has refined his existence as has no other force in all history. At the same time it has partitioned human experi- ence into a supernatural world over against a natural world, and this dual- ism has haunted and confused man's thinking like an evil spirit out of the past, from ancient days even to the present. If we are to seek an adequate translation of kami in the generic sense of mysterious power, or of Kami as a deification, we must make use of a descriptive phrase. A kami-object is a holy or sacred object; a kami- person is a holy or sacred person. A deity is not properly designated when merely called Kami. Correct regard for the historical Japanese usage requires the attachment of a descriptive element indicating some primary function or characteristic. Otherwise the tendency is for the meaning to revert to the original generic sense. Usage which attempts to indicate the object of Christian faith merely with the word Kami is</page><page sequence="43">393 The Mean'ng of Kami 67 open to serious question. The Roman Catholic practice of employing a separate and totally distinct title for the supreme object of their worship affords a much more rational and historically valid solution of the problem. We cannot close the discussion without taking time to point out that the character of the religious experience that we discover in the study of the meaning of kami is much more meaningful in human evolution than the idea of gods and goddesses. The latter come and go in a cycle of life and death that parallels the mortality of man himself; but without a sacr- ed world to challenge his utmost dedications man would cease to be truly man. We mnay accept with confidence the opinion of S6derblom when he says: Holi ness is the great work in religion; it is even more essential than the no- tion of God. Real religion may exist without a definite conception of divinity, but there is no real religion without a distinction between holy and profane.133) While we may accept this statement as setting forth a profound truth, we must, at the same time, be prepared to admit that the grounds on which holiness, or kami-nature, is attributed to various significant events in Japanese experience vary greatly with the changing cultural levels in the historical development. This is manifestly true. The modern educ- ated Japanese finds nothing of the feeling of the holy in the fear of the wolf or in the magic of the phallus. He finds his sacred world in the values of moral living. He discovers his holy, kami-relationships, in the highest interests and supreme personages of his state and social life, in the deep emotions that they call forth, and in his participation in the power- ful sentiments and habits that are associated with true and tried tradition. Nevertheless the old survives even in the present and mingles with the new in forming the ideas and practices that are associated with the sacred. Thus various and sometimes uncongenial elements of belief and feeling enter into the making of the basis on which the existence of the sacred is affirmed: magical efficacy; the emanation of mysterious virtue from the great and mighty; a superior guardian power over human affairs on the part of the spirits of the dead; the transcendent, super- rational authority of the gods, and human accountability thereto; sense of social approval and of personal emotional expansion arising out of dedication to the highest interests of the common life; satisfaction over -participation in the approved sentiments and habits; pride in the racial 133) Art.

Holtom 394 achievement; conviction of a great national destiny and of the supreme worth of the causes that demand loyalty and obedience; and sense of majesty and exaltation in the presence of the great personages of the national life and in the contemplation of the unique characteristics of the all-powerful state. These are some of the elements that stimulate the conviction on the part of the contemporary Japanese that a sacred, kami-quality inheres in their personal and national experience. Not all of these elements are reconcilable the one with the other; probably not all can be rationally justified. Indeed, one of the major problems of the Japanese people-as of other peoples elsewhere-lies in the direction of the progressive refine- ment and deepening of the content of the sacred. This refinement must retain the exceptional national capacity for faith and loyalty and at the same time provide a content that is logically reconcilable with what the. best intelligence of the nation knows to be true and abiding.</page></plain_text>
