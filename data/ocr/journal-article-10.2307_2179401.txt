<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dialogues on Metaphysics and on Religion. By NICHOLAS MALEBRANCHE. Translated by MORRIS GINSBERG, M.A., with a Preface by Professor G. DAWES HICKS. New York, The Macmillan Company, I923. PP. 374. Mr. Ginsberg has performed a genuine service in presenting us with this lucid translation of this very lucid author. The works of Malebranche, and this systematic exposition of his philosophy in particular, are of interest, not only from the point of view of the history of Cartesianism and Platonism, but from the constructive standpoint as well. From the latter standpoint, Malebranche's epistemology will be of chief interest at the present time, with his meta- physics in the second place and his 'Calvinistic' theology lagging consider- ably behind. Malebranche is chiefly known in the histories of philosophy as the propounder of the system of occasionalism, but I should argue that his chief interest from the contemporary standpoint is in the field of the theory of knowledge. The significance of occasionalism is sometimes over-rated. It did not arise so much from a critical attitude towards the concept of causality as from a reckless emphasis on the omnipotence of God. Mr. Ginsberg urges against Novaro, the author of a valuable German thesis on Malebranche, that he (Novaro) "entirely ignored the immense difference that really sub- sists between Hume and Malebranche in regard to causality. Malebranche does not, in truth, deny a necessary connection between cause and effect. He</page><page sequence="2">2I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. simply insists that such necessary connection is to be found only between one unique cause, namely, God, and its effects. . . . It is true that Malebranche himself admits that the divine power is inexplicable; but throughout he takes refuge in the thought of God's omnipotence and insists that between the will of God and its effects there must be a necessary connection, since God's volitions are bound to be efficacious" (p. 56). Mr. Ginsberg's remark ought to set at rest those ever-recurrent attempts to connect Hume and Malebranche. Malebranche had no thought of discarding the conceptions either of causality or of substance, a fact which may be counted either to his credit or his dis- credit according to one's convictions. His connection with Hume is rather that they both belonged in the same world of ideas, in the same clear 'ration- alistic' atmosphere which is the strength of the philosophy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. The present Dialogues strike me as especially valuable as reading-matter for students who are trying to think their way to clarity on the fundamental problems of epistemology and metaphysics. The first six of the fourteen dialogues, in particular, contain much valuable epistemological matter which is so clearly and pictorially expressed that the beginning student is sure to be fascinated. These dialogues will no doubt be used along with the works of Berkeley and Hume by way of introduction to epistemology and no doubt Malebranche will come to stand to many a student as the outstanding example of the awful consequences of committing some epistemological fallacy, such as "representative perceptionism" or "hypostatization of concepts." The fact is that one can get a very intelligible theory of knowledge from Male- branche by substituting for the emotional and religious term, God, the purely epistemological term, Universal Reason. That we see all things in God means that we see all things with the aid of Universal Reason the content of which consists of certain eternal ideas. These eternal ideas or essences underlie and determine the world of concrete existence. Their existence is more cer- tain than is the existence of particular objects. " It is much easier to prove the reality of ideas, or if I may use your terms, the reality of this other world filled with the beauties of intelligence than to prove the existence of the material world. . . . Ideas have an eternal and necessary existence, but the corporeal world exists only because it pleased God to create it. So in order to see the intelligible world, it is sufficient to consult reason which contains the ideas, or the eternal and necessary intelligible essences, and this can be accomplished by all minds that are rational, or are united to the infinite reason. But in order to see the material world, or rather to judge that this world exists, since this world is invisible in itself, it is necessary that God should reveal it to us, for we cannot see his arbitrary volitions in the necessary Reason. Now God reveals the existence of his creations in two ways, by the authority of the sacred writings and by means of the senses" (p. 75). The position of Male- branche is thus very similar to that of another more worldly Platonist, Mr. Santayana. In both cases belief in the outer world is a matter of faith, in the one case of Christian faith, in the other case of animal faith.</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 2I3 Malebranche's clear differentiation between the psychic, the physical and the ideal reminds one of the way in which that very clear and painstaking writer, Edmund Husserl, draws the same distinction. Malebranche is akin to Husserl also in the matter of logical absolutism. Man "knows nothing ex- cept by the light of reason, by which I mean the universal Reason, which enlightens all minds by the intelligible ideas which it reveals to them in its ever-luminous substance. . . . It is the Divine Word which enlightens us by means of the intelligible ideas which it contains. For there are not two or more wisdoms, two or more universal reasons. Truth is immutable, necessary, eternal, the same in time and in eternity, the same in us and in strangers, the same in heaven and in hell. The eternal Word speaks the same language to all nations, to the Chinese and Tartars as to the French and Spaniards; and if they are not all equally enlightened, it is because they are not equally attentive, it is because they confuse, in varied degrees, the particular impulses of their self-love with the general responses of inner truth. Twice two are four for all peoples. All understand the voice of truth which bids us not to do to others that which we do not wish to be done to ourselves' (p. ioi). One may well ask whether there is not a residuum of truth in this strict logical abolutism which our pragmatists and psychologizers have failed to grasp. Malebranche takes his stand on the necessary truths of mathematics and ethics and makes it clear that such truths, at least, have an eternal validity which is entirely independent of our mental processes. Students of metaphysics and theology will also find much of interest. Among the points clearly set forth one finds the distinction of mind and body, in which Malebranche closely follows Descartes, a clear statement of the Onto- logical Argument in its most radical and thought-provoking form, the system of occasionalism applied not only to the relation of mind and body but to causation in general, the attributes of God, the distinction between intelligible extension and the divine immensity, a purification of the idea of God of anthropomorphic conceptions-"God is neither good, compassionate, nor patient in the vulgar sense of these terms. These attributes as they are or- dinarily understood are unworthy of the infinitely perfect being" (p. 32I),-a discussion of the question as to why the infinitely perfect being created a world of finite and imperfect beings, a theory of evil on the basis of the generality of the decrees of Providence, discussion of the relation between the divine will and divine reason (divine will is based on divine reason and not vice versa as Descartes taught), and of the simplicity and fecundity of the ways of God in contrast to the indefinitely large number of his creations. Certain special theological questions are also discussed from the austere Augustinian stand- point which caused Malebranche to be suspected of Jansenism during his life time. With regard to the translation itself, I find nothing to criticize. A new translation of the Recherche de la ve'rite' would also be of value, especially con- sidering the strong interest in epistemology which is characteristic of the times. The Traite de Morale ought to be translated also, not only because it is one</page><page sequence="4">214 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. of the first (if not the first) modern treatises on ethics, but also because there are ideas in it of permanent worth. The times seem propitious for a revival of interest in the rationalistic philosophy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and someone who would continue the work of Mr. Ginsberg would be rendering a real service. The only deficiency I observe in the present work, and it is not a serious one, is the absence of a bibliography. The student taking up the study of Malebranche ought to be reminded that there are certain valu- able works on him in the French language; I recall the works of Joly and of Olle-Laprune as well as that splendid number of the Revue de mettaphysique et de morale (in volume XXIII) in honor of Malebranche. I presume, however, that Mr. Ginsberg proceeded on the logical assumption that those who had to rely on a translation would not be interested in further literature in a language which they, presumably, did not understand. But his very useful book will be utilized by many who could read the original, especially in view of the present notorious lack of a good French edition of this or of any other of the works of this eminent French philosopher.
