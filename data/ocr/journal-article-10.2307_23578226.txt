<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 69, 4 (1988) 713-740 Ν Ο Τ A E On Some Recent Christological Literature The present review-article on recent Christological literature does not claim to include ali that has been written on the subject during the last two or three years. The selection has been quite naturai, those works only being included which have been recently sent for review by the Gregorianum. The books included have been published between 1986 and 1988. This, however, does not mean that ali are originai publications dating from then. Some are recent translations into English of books published in another language at an earlier date. Even so, it was thought worthwhile to make of them a joint presentation which would allow for a more synthetic approach. The material reviewed here will thus be divided into four sections: Biblical Christology; Traditional Christol ology; Systematic Christology; and Liberation Christology. It is hoped that, inspite of the fragmentary character of this Note a general picture will emerge of the present direction of Christological studies, and a clear idea will be formed of some prominent Christological themes. 1. Biblical Christology In his Introduction to Messianic Exegesis, D. Juel, Associate Professor of New Testament at Lutheran North-western Theological Seminary, St Paul, Minnesota, states the thesis of his book' as follows: "The beginnings of Christian reflection can be traced to interpretations of Israel's Scriptures, and the major focus of that scriptural interpretation was Jesus, the crucified and risen Messiah" (ρ. 1). He thus makes his own the thesis defended by his teacher N.A. Dahl in The Crucified Messiah, according to which the confession of Jesus as Messiah is primary in early Christianity; Juel attempts to corroborate the thesis by studying the development of Christological interpretation of the Scriptures. The book aims, therefore, at showing the precedence of the Christological interpretation 1 Donald Juel, Messianic Exegesis. Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1988; cm 22=14,5, pp. XII+193.</page><page sequence="2">714 JACQUES DUPUIS, S I. of Old Testament Messianic texts in the building of New Testament Christology. "If it can be demonstrated that the confession of Jesus as Messiah-King provides the major focal point of exegetical tradition, it will lend greater plausibility to Dahl's proposai and may offer some suggestions for further work both on New Testament Christology and on the reconstruction of early Christian interpreta tion, paralleling work on Jewish exegetical tradition" (pp. 2-3). The importance of the thesis need not be stressed, least of ali in the context of the present Jewish-Christian dialogue. For, besides the fact that often among contemporary Christologists the Christological title receiving most attention is not that of Messiah, but of prophet, this is also the title favoured by the Jewish-Christian dialogue in preference to that of Messiah upon which differences between the two traditions are acute. If, however, the evolution of Christology cannot be understood without appreciating the place of exegesis, neither can early Christian exegesis be understood without reference to the way people read the Bible in the Jewish world before Christ and during the first century. "The greatest difference between early Christian exegesis and other forms of Jewish scriptural interpretation is the impact made by Jesus" (p. 57). But, to show the impact Jesus made on the interpretative tradition and how the scriptural heritage influenced the shape of Christology, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between Jewish and Christian interpretation, avoiding the danger of imposing anticipated Christological meaning on Old Testament texts. Juel reviews successively the Christian Messianic interpretation of 2 Sam 7, of the Psalms, of the Servant of Second Isaiah, and of Dan 7. The investigation shows that, convinced that Jesus was the promised Messiah, Christians undertook the task of reflecting on the Gospel of his death and resurrection in the light of the aforesaid scriptural texts; those texts thus played a criticai role in the develop ment of Christian exegesis and of New Testament Christology. Juel concludes as follows: "the confession of Jesus as the crucified and risen King of the Jews stands at the beginning of Christological reflection and interpretation of the Scriptures — at least the reflection and interpretation that form the substructure of New Testament Christianity" (p. 171); it is its point of departure, its presupposition, if not its content (p. 177). In his Loci Communes of 1521, Ph. Melanchthon wrote: "This is to know Christ, to know his benefits". Against the scholastic theologians he held that to know Christ is not a matter of perceiving "his natures and the mode of his incarnation", nor of becoming acquainted with the historical and earthly Jesus; one can know Christ only in light of his redemptive work. Melanchthon, from whom A.J. Hultgren borrows the title of a recent book2, echoed the Reforma tion prò nobis character of the Christ-event, especially of the death on the cross, that is, the soteriological perspective detached from which speculation on the 2 Arland J.

Hultgren belongs to the Lutheran tradition; his book centres on redemption in Jesus Christ in the New Testament — 'redemption' being used broadly as a convenient shorthand for the work of God in Christ or Christ's own work. Two basic questions guide the discussion: How do the New Testament writers portray Christ in his redemptive work? And what are the benefits which he brings and which would not otherwise be available to humanity? Having rapidly examined the New Testament data which seem to place the redemptive work of Christ in the future of the parousia (such as the maranatha formula), the author begins his search for the origins of redemptive Christology in the light of the cross and resurrection. After discussing various opinions (Perrin, Schillebeeckx, Hengel), he himself concludes that at a first stage of New Testament soteriology the cross and the resurrection were considered the redemptive event (with the stress on the resurrection), while at a second stage death and resurrection represent two scenes in one dramatic act, the death by itself being seen as atonig. More precisely Hultgren distinguishes four main types of redemptive Christology in the New Testament; these, he notes, come to expression at different times without strict chronological sequence among them. Each represents a distinct way of conceiving the mystery of redemption, each with different emphases. Among the four main types two are "theopractic" and two "Christopractic". They are as follows: 1. Redemption accomplished in Christ's death and resurrection; this theopractic type comes to expression in Paul and in Mark. 2. Redemption confirmed through Christ: this type also is theopractic, Christ being shown as obedient to God, but his will and that of God being more intertwined. The emphasis is on Christ's power in his resurrected state, God confirming his promises through Christ's ministry, death and resurrection. This type is represented by Matthew and Luke-Acts. 3. Redemp tion won by Christ: this resolutely Christopractic type marks a decisive shift. Christ comes from above to redeem and, his work accomplished, returns to God's glory. He offers himself as sacrifice, reconciling ali things to God. The redemptive value of the cross is brought out; yet the emphasis falls upon the resurrection and the heavenly reign. This type of soteriology is expressed in Colossians, Ephesians, the Pastoral Epistles, 1 Peter, Hebrews, and Revelation. 4. Redemption mediated by Christ: this type too is Christopractic, Christ actually mediating salvation, laying down his life on his own accord and having the power to take it up again. This type is found in John and the Epistles of John. Having identified the four types of redemptive Christology and rapidly described them, Hultgren in a second pari of the book investigates each of them distinctly and at length. We cannot here follow him through this complex investigation; some general observations must suffice. Hultgren rightly observes that the oldest formulas of redemptive Christology of which traces are found in the epistles of Paul and the discourses of Acts, are theopractic, Jesus being the object of God's action: "The theopractic emphasis is precisely what one might expect at the outset of the Christian movement, for that would have been in</page><page sequence="4">716 JACQUES DUPUIS, S I. keeping with its monotheistic heritage from Judaism" (p. 64). Later, comment ing on the third type Hultgren stresses the universal scope of salvation in Christ which, however, the various authors representing this third type understand differently: Christ is thought of as a universal figure, the source of salvation for ali humanity.... But how far does that scope reach beyond the limits of proclamation in history? Here there is a division among the writers. In the case of 1 Peter and Hebrews there is silence; the limitations are set, by implication, at the circumfer ence of proclamation; further, the disobedient are judged (1 Peter), and the apostates have excluded themselves (Hebrews). But in the case of the other writers there are no implied limits to the scope of final salvation; no part of humanity is left unaffected by the benefits of Christ, who gave himself for ali (p. 141). The picture appears different in the fourth type represented by John's Gospel and Letters. The salvific mediation of Christ, founded in his cross and resurrection, takes place where and when people believe in the Son; thus it is contingent upon the faith of individuai persons. "The redemptive Christology of the fourth type, which states more clearly than any other that salvation is mediated by Christ solely to those who believe in him, is the most exclusive of ali" (p. 163). In the Gospel, the world — those who have not heard and those who have not believed — are considered lost. However, in John's Letters, those who are excluded are the secessionist Christians, and, while the gift of eternai life continues to be spoken of as a possession of believers in the present, the futurity of salvation is brought out more strongly than in the Gospel; Christ's benefits remain universal in scope (pp. 159-160). An important third part of the book examines the "basic questions" raised by the four types of redempitive Christology studied earlier, assesses the four types, and asks what challenges New Testament soteriology sets for us today. In this context, the problem of the universal scope of redemption is again raised. That it reaches out to ali humanity is not universally found in ali the types and the attendant writings: Mark, Matthew, Luke, 1 Peter, Hebrews are silent as to the salvation of those who have not heard the Gospel, while in John those who have not heard or not believed are lost (p. 179). Since the four types cannot be harmonised, it is necessary to come to terms with their points of disagreement. This, says Hultgren, implies thinking out a redemptive Christology for our time, one that will be responsive to both the New Testament and our present circumstances. Each of the New Testament types is a particular facet, or angle of vision; each has its specific goal. Each can contribute its share to the building up of a soteriological theory for today. Such soteriology should stress the common elements running through the four types, specially the unity of cross and resurrection as the event in which redemption is achieved and the new age inaugurated. Hultgren goes on to profess the theological priority of the first type, "because it provides a way of expressing redemptive Christology which coheres most consistently with the canon and the historical ministry of Jesus of</page><page sequence="5">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 717 Nazareth" (p. 189). There remains, however, the fact that in the context of a world-view which is quite apart from that of the New Testament, the redemptive Christology of the New Testament raises challenges for Christian thought and action today. With regard to universalism and exclusivism, Hultgren notes that "it is possible, on the basis of the New Testament, to assert the particularism of the Christian Gospel — that in Jesus Christ God has redeemed humanity — without drawing consequences of exclusivism from it" (p. 201). As for the difference between the traditions, "In the final analysis it is necessary to come to terms with the two traditions, recognise that they are finally not compatible, and subject the whole matter to theological critique informed by the canonical sources" (p. 202). The "heart of the matter" to be discerned critically is: "What is it, in light of the common claims and the competing claims of the New Testament, that one can say about Christ as the one in whom God has acted for the redemption of humanity?" And Hultgren's answer: "Whatever else is said, it should begin with the claim that in the crucified and risen Christ God has reconciled the world to himself — totally and unconditionally — and that the Gospel, and the Good News, declares that it is so" (p. 206). Who are the poor in the New Testament? Are they the economically poor and the other oppressed and marginalized sections of society? Or can the term be spiritualized simply to stand for openness to God? The question is not new. In his magisterial study on the Beatitutes Jacques Dupont, an outstanding biblical scholar of our time, lent much support to the first view; others, for instance W.E. Pilgrim in Good News to the Poor (Minneapolis, 1981), opt for the other. "This book", we are told in the Preface of the volume under review here3, "originated in a realization that there is contradiction between the Bible and the interpretation of it by those of us involved in First-World Churches and biblical scholarship... [It] is also the result of a realization of how unjust it is to deprive the poor of their Gospel by interpreting it in such a way that it becomes our promise, a promise to the wealthy" (p.v.). Since its first publication in German in 1978 as Jesus von Nazareth — Hoffnung der Armen, the book has been followed by a companion volume edited by Willy Schottroff and Wolfgang Stegemann, already available in English under the title The God of the Lowly (Maryknoll, New York, Orbis Books, 1984). Both volumes intend to articulate a First-World interpretation of the Old and New Testament along the lines of liberation theology. The authors are convinced that "for centuries, our biblical interpretation has made the poor objects of our solicitude, and those texts which declare that the poor are 'first' and that they are the ones to whom 'the reign of God belongs' have been spiritualized — 'lifted' to a symbolic level" (p. vi).

For the Bible "takes sides". Thus, the authors' historical criticism of the biblical texts resolutely takes into account the socio-historical setting, as they seek to discover the attitudes of the earliest Christian communities towards the poor. Sceptical as to whether it is possible to recover the actual words of Jesus, the two New Testament professors from the Universities of Mainz and Heidelberg look at the Gospels as a produci of the historical "Jesus movement"; the most important stages of that movement from a literary point of view are: the earliest Jesus tradition; the sayings-source (Q); the Gospel of Mark; the Gospel of Luke; the Gospel of Mathew (p. 5). In the earliest Jesus traditions, as exemplified among other passages by the first three beatitudes (in the Lukan form), the parable of the rich man and Lazarus and the accusation that Jesus was a friend of tax collectors and sinners, they find the centrai theme to be an eschatological reversai of the fortunes of the rich and the poor by which Jesus becomes the hope of the destitute. Poverty in the beatitudes is to be understood as an economie and social condìtion, not as an ethical or religious attitude. This is not to say that God is not also the God of the rich, but it means that God's promise of a glorious future kingdom must first be realized in those whose actual existence is most remote from the promise of a life without want and suffering. "In adopting this outlook, the Jesus movement was making an enormous religious claim. It was asserting that God is on the side of those worst off in the present world. It was claiming that God takes the part of the poor and the tax collectors, simply because they are poor, deprived and despised" (p. 36). If this was the convinction of the Jesus movement at the time of the earliest tradition, what happened after? The "wandering prophets" of the sayings-source (Q), as they can be retrieved from the sayings and parables, adopted a quite different attitude. The poor refer now to the disciples; it is they whom Jesus calls blessed. The centrai perspective is no longer that of an eschatological reversai, but the freedom from anxiety and trust in God that must characterise the disciples. As for the rich, what is now emphasised is the distance which separates them from God. Next we come to the picture of the poor in the Gospel of Luke. We are told that to a much greater extent than Matthew and Mark, Luke transmits traditional material in which the problem created by the social distinction of poor and rich plays a part. Luke has been called "very much a socialist thinker", or, as some preferred to put it to avoid politicai overtones, he is "the evangelist of the poor" (p. 67). By following Jesus, his disciples have become poor; this voluntary poverty to which they are specially called as disciples is the source of their blessedness. The praise of the poor in Jesus' Sermon on the Plain applies therefore only to the disciples. The story of the rich man also shows that in Luke's eyes a complete renunciation of possessions is an indispensable compo nent in following Jesus as a disciple. "The Lucan Jesus praises neither poverty as</page><page sequence="7">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 719 such nor individuale who are unwillingly condemned to poverty. In Luke's view poverty as a consequence of the voluntary renunciation of possessions is a price that must unconditionally be paid for following Jesus as a disciple" (p. 78). Luke is in fact referring to the disciples who followed Jesus during his earthly life; by doing so they received a share in the basileia of God, already present in Jesus. But, by the same token, Luke is very much also the "evangelist of the rich", in the sense of stressing the need for them to be converted to a life in keeping with the social message of Jesus; no other Gospel has so much to say about the cali which Jesus addresses to the rich to repent and renounce material goods in favour of the economically weaker. Luke looks for an equal distribution of wealth in the Christian community. The book sums up his outlook as follows: Luke "is far from offering a politicai program for a comprehensive redistribution of property throughout society. He does, however, have a program, but it is for the Christian community. In his picture of the first Christian community in Jerusalem he formulates his own utopian vision of a Christian community characterised by material and social equity" (p. 117). From Christology theological reflection is often moving in recent years to theo-logy, that is to God as he is manifested and revealed in Jesus Christ. W. Kasper, Ch. Duquoc, J.P. Mackey, B. Forte, H. Kting, J. Moltmann are just a few among recent Christologists who from Christology proper have moved on to the God of Jesus and to the Trinity. The "difference" which the God of Jesus makes must, however, be established on solid biblical evidence. To this end Le Dieu de Jésus of Jacques Schlosser4 will be of great assistance to theologians. The professor of Strasbourg had previously published Le règne de Dieu dans les dits de Jésus (Gabalda, Etudes Bibliques, 1980). The present work is more accessible, but not less exegetically acute. The author explicitly acknowledges his debt to and dependence upon many previous studies. But his work, while bringing their results together, has the added merit of completing and sharpen ing their findings on disputed issues. This is not to say that the study provides us with a complete picture of the Christian God; it rather concentrates on some particular, but important features which, the continuity with the Old Testament notwithstanding, point to the "difference" of the God of Jesus who disturbs us in our received ideas. It is the theo-logy of the historical, prepaschal Jesus, unencombered by added interpretation, which Schlosser seeks to discover. To retrieve it from our present documents, a rigorous sifting of the logia is required. While being conscious of the limits of the historico-critical method, Schlosser believes that it must make an indispensable contribution. In his view, the two-source theory remains even today the most operative. He thus distinguishes in the Gospel data four different strata: the Markan tradition, Q (the tradition common to Mt-Lk), 4 Jacques Schlosser, Le Dieu de Jesus. Etude exégétique (Lectio Divina, 129).

The criteria which regulate the sifting of the logia are, however, not easy to handle: not ali exegetes will agree to deny the historicity of the logion on the lack of knowledge of the Son in Mk 13:32, or of those in Mt on the fatherhood of God (pp. 157-175). Also open to discussion is the general evaluation of the Gospel of John as a rereading which "offers no access to the preaching of Jesus" (p. 17) and which, conse quently, needs to be entirely left out of consideration in an effort to retrieve the theo-logical logia of Jesus. While the fourth gospel needs to be treated with special criticai care, theo-logical logia with dose antecedents in the earlier gospels are not lacking in it. The first part of the book, entitled "Approches", reviews the designations of God by Jesus and draws the main lines of the portrait of Jesus' God. Jesus unhesitatingly uses the generic term 'God', being thereby faithful to the practice of the Old Testament and in touch with that of contemporary Judaism; unlike the latter, however, he hardly uses the term 'Kyrios'. Jesus accents God's faithfulness and reliability rather than the divine sovereignty. He thus inherited an essential trait of Old Testament theo-logy: "God manifests himself in history, by his action" (p. 27) — a trait which will be further stressed by the postpaschal community in the light of the Easter event. Typical of Jesus seems to be his designation of God as Father. Significant is also his emphasis on the present action of God through his own ministry: his own praxis is the "concrete form of the divine action" (p. 69). He awaits God's decisive intervention in favour of the poor and marginalized of society. The second part, entitled "Le Dieu Pére", is the book's centrai core. After recalling the relevant data of the Old Testament and ancient Judaism, the author studies critically the synoptic logia where Jesus himself refers to God as Father. A special chapter is devoted to Abba, a term which Jesus alone seems to have used in his time while invoking God in prayer (Mk 14: 36). Concerning the antecedents of the designation of God as Father, Schlosser concludes that, even while the fundamental traits of the divine fatherhood are outlined in the Old Testament, yet this designation of God is not yet centrai in ancient Judaism. It becomes so with the practice of Jesus, though it needs to be noted that Jesus emphasises God's fatherhood towards those who follow him as disciples. Corning to Abba and Mk 14: 36, Schlosser recalls first the thesis of J. Jeremias (which has gone through various stages in response to his critics): Abba represents the ipsissima vox lesu and expresses the unique familiarity with which Jesus addressed God in prayer. Reconsidering the extant data, specially some Aramaeic texts which have recently come to the fore (G. Vermes and others), Schlosser Comes to the following conclusione: while the use of Abba as a designation of God is not altogether unknown outside Jesus, his invocation of God by that term, with the familiarity involved, remains proper to him. Jesus' familiarity with God, expressed in the term Abba, connotes trust and obedience, commitment and respect. Yet, "Sa pointe pour la théo-logie de Jésus ne parait pas résider dans l'immédiateté avec laquelle Jésus se situe par rapport à Dieu,</page><page sequence="9">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 721 c'est-à-dire dans la perception de Dieu comme tout proche, directement accessible. Nous touchons là à l'originalité de Jésus" (p. 207). Jesus' Abba remains thus a centrai element of Jesus' theo-logy, and an important foundation for the Church's post-Easter Christological reflection. Under the heading "Un Dieu déconcertant", the third part of the hook contains two studies: the first, on the parable of the labourers in the vineyard (Mt 20:1-15); the other, on the love of enemies (Mt 5:44ff). Schlosser brings out their theological significance: the first reveals a God who outdoes human justice through his infinite bounty; the other puts the stress on God's disturbing love for the wicked. Jesus, Schlosser concludes, borrowing from Ch. Duquoc, is the "prophet of a God different from the God commonly received" (Dieu différent, Paris, Cerf, 1978, p. 12). Conscious of not having given a full picture of the God of Jesus in the New Testament — this would have required among other things a more complete treatment of the parables — Schlosser highlights in conclusion the intimate relationship between Jesus' eschatology and his theo-logy. Rather than affirm ing the priority of one over the other, the deep unity of both in Jesus' mind needs to be emphasised. Jesus understood the eschatological reign of God, present in him, as the anticipated irruption of God's decisive saving action in the world. But the God, who was so breaking through to the world of men, was the Father of infinite kindness and mercy. God's fatherhood and his reign on earth were thus inseparable for Jesus himself. 2. Traditional Chrìstology A. Grilimeier's reputation as the authority on the history of Chrìstology in the early centuries of Christianity has long been established. In 1951, for the 15th centenary of the Council of Chalcedon, he contributed the opening study to the monumentai 3-volume commemorative work on the Council, which he co-edited with H. Bacht, under the title Das Konkil von Chalkedon: Geschichte und Gegenwart (Wiirzburg, 1951-1954). Grilimeier's contribution (voi. I, pp. 5-202) studied the development in theology and language which eventually led to the crystallisation in the Chalcedonian formula of the Christological dogma. This seminai work, revised and expanded over the years, was published in English under the title Christ in Christian Tradition (Mowbray, 1965). Again expanded, it went one year later into another edition in English under the same title, but this time with the addition "Volume One" (Mowbray, 1975), which promised well for further develepments. At the same time, Grillmeier published Mit Ihm und in Ihm (Freiburg, 1975), a thick volume of 700 pages with mastery contributions to patristic Chrìstology, post-Chalcedonian developments, the reception of the Council, the application of modem hermeneutics to early Chrìstology, and other related topics. Finally, Jesus der Christus im Glauben der Kirche. Band 2/1: Das Konzil von Chalkedon, Rezeption und Widerspruch (451-518) was published by Herder in 1986. The same appears now in English</page><page sequence="10">722 JACQUES DUPUIS, S I. translation5. Though in the English edition the subtitle extends to the entire period covered by both parts of Volume II, the period covered in this Part I and the material it contains coincide exactly with those ot the German edition. The subtitle of the volume, "Reception and Contradiction", indicates well the eventful period and tortuous history which the Christological dogma knew after the Chalcedonian definition. This, as Grillmeier shows, was partly due to the politicai intrigues of popes and emperors alike, who vied for authority over the Church, partly to the dearth of theologians of high calibre which characte rised the period following the demise of Leo the Great. Grillmeier explores the power-struggles and controversies, and more importantly studies the key documents which marked post-Chalcedonian Christology as it moved from the second half of the fifth century into the sixth. Chalcedon, while it is undoubtedly the most decivise landmark in the elaboration of the Christological dogma, is also the first Council in the history of the Church to have led to, or unwittingly resulted in, a breach between the Christian Churches. Already in his preface to the volume Grillmeier points to its ecumenical relevance for today (p. vi). "Reception" of a Council, as we have come to know better both from recent studies and concrete experience, can be a long and painful process. Chalcedon was a case in point. Yet, the separation it brought about between Christian Churches notwithstanding, Grillmeier can claim that "despite ali the differences, conditioned as they are culturally and intellectually, the great regions of the orbis christologicus, whether Eastern or Western, are one in their faith in Christ, especially on the basis of baptismal kerygma and the every-day faith of the Churches" (pp. v-vi). This assessment is dramatically confirmed by the joint declarations and common professions of faith made by recent popes and the representatives of post-Chalcedonian Churches separated from Rome, such as the Coptic Church of Egypt, the Armenian Church, and the Jacobite Church. Such common professions of faith deliberately bypassed the controverted terminology of Chalcedon, in particular the expression "in two natures" which to the parties concerned seemed to contradict the doctrine of Ephesus and of Cyril of Alexandria. Instances of such recent ecumenical gestures worth recording are: the common profession of faith of Pope Paul VI and Shenouda II, Patriarch of Alexandria of the Egyptians (10 May 1973) (AAS 65 [1973] 299-301), which had been preceded by the joint declaration of the same pope with Ignatius Jacob III, patriarch of Antioch of the Syrians (27 october 1971) (AAS 63 [1971] 814); more recently stili, the joint declaration of Pope John Paul II and Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch (23 June 1984) (Enchiridion Vaticanum, Voi. 9, pp. 838-847).

It is not possible to follow here ali the meanders of the eventful, often tragic, sometimes sad story, so vividly and masterfully retold by Grillmeier. An important episode of it, put in high relief by the author, is the Edict of Emperor Zeno, called Henoticon (482). It was devised by the emperor as a possible basis for communion between Antioch-Constantinople and Alexandria; to this end it deliberately avoided the controversial Chalcedonian terminology of two natures. But, however dogmatically acceptable the solution might have been, neither the anti-Chalcedonians nor Pope Hormisdas could declare their agree ment with it. "The actual interpretation of the document by the estranged parties made any attempt at mediation impossible. In the last resort the whole discussion again ended up in the direct recognition or rejection of Chalcedon" (p. 315). The West placed the Henoticon on a par with monophysitism, the pope defending Chalcedon and Leo the Great against the reproach of Nestorianism levelled at them by the East. Grillmeier comments: "Obviously the time was not yet ripe to analyse the theological language used by both sides in their formulas, to define the concepts and to contrast what was really meant with the linguistic and conceptual expression, so that in that way trae disagreement and genuine agreement could be established" (p. 329). He adds: "... ecclesiastical authority and the theologians lacked the insight or the ability to look sufficiently behind language and formulas and to judge from that vantage point whether there was mutuai disagreement or consensus" (p. 330). "The representatives of the two traditions in what was substantially the one faith in the incarnation of God in Christ had already become so estranged that they could discover in each other only what was opposed, no longer what they had in common" (p. 333). This is not to say that Chalcedon could in fact have been dispensed with. As Grillmeier finally observes: For the Church Chalcedon had a mission that could not be surrendered. The Alexandrian picture of Christ expressed by Cyril, especially when it was intensified by taking over the mia physis language, needed Constant correction. For this picture of Christ was top-heavy, since it was conceived too one-sidedly from above.... The principle of the hegemony of the Logos dominated the presentation of Christ's humanity in such a way that an adequate appreciation of the 'earthly' Jesus in his human, adult mental life, in his knowing and willing and in his freedon was not possible. According to this theological conception ali spiritual movement in Christ flows from above downwards. In spite of the fundamental recognition of the human soul in Christ..., this Christology... was in a disquieting manner already on the way to monenergism and monothelitism" (p. 336). Here it is seen that, viewed in its historical context which was the refutation of monophysitism, the Chalcedonian formula, at least in its intention, was meeting, more than is usually recognised, the preoccupation of much recent Christology, that is, to do justice to the fulness of humanity in Jesus Christ.</page><page sequence="12">724 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. Following Part I on the "Reception and Contradiction" that followed Chalcedon, Part II of Volume II of Grillmeier's masterly and voluminous work will take up the theological issues of the Chalcedonian restoration and focus on the Second Council of Constantinople (553). As the present book is a part volume, it ends without an index; this will be found at the end of Part II, stili to be published. Volume III will hopefully deal with the period from the death of Gregory the Great (604) to about 800. In 1981 J.B. Carol, a Franciscan, published a first book on the vexing problem of the motive of the Incarnation, which has divided Thomists from Scotists over the centuries. That book, entitled The Absolute Primacy and Predestination of Jesus and His Virgin Mother (Chicago, III", 1981), as the author acknowledges today, "suffered from some serious limitations which appreciably diminished its value and thus clamored for a more balanced and adequate presentation" (ρ. 1). Hence the new volume now under review6. The author warns from the outset that the question is badly put whenever considerations of hypothetical world orders set in, as when it is asked whether or not, had man not sinned, the Son of God would have become incarnate. He defends St Thomas, and (mostly) Scotus, against the charge of having raised such abstract, hypothe tical questions. For them the question is not whether the Incarnation would or would not have taken place in a world order different from the concrete one in which we live. Rather, it is: What is, according to God's mind, the meaning of Christ in the present order of reality? He writes: "The question then should be formulated as follows: Whether in the present world order (the only one willed by God) the Word's Incarnation depended or not on the sin of our first parent. Or, rephrased somewhat differently: Whether or not Christ and His Blessed Mother were efficaciously predestined to existence with logicai priority to ali others" (p. 4). To accuse St Thomas or Scotus of anthropomorphism in their way of thinking about God because of the signa rationis they posit in him, is a baseless accusation; for they know well that in God there is neither "before" nor "after" in the chronological sense, the signa rationis being but "logicai moments which we attribute to God in order to express in human fashion the causai order existing in one, simple, indivisible divine decree of predestination" (p. 4). The question disputed between Thomists and Scotists is then: Is the divine pian concerning the present world order "hamartocentric" or "Christocentric"? The book is divided into two parts. In Part I the author states the Thomistic thesis and the grounds on which it rests, adding a century-by-century dossier in which are recorded the various authors who have held it over the centuries. In Part II (which occupies the bulk of the volume), the Scotistic thesis is set forth, 6 Juniper Β. Carol, O.F.M., Why Jesus Chrìst? Thomistic, Scotistic and Conciliatory Perspectives.

The intermediate opinions propounded by Suarez, Molina, and Rocca-Roschini, based on God's scientia media, are briefly mentioned in an Appendix and dismissed as unsatisfactory. Between the Thomistic and Scotistic positions Carol's sympathy goes clearly to the latter. And rightly, as far as it goes. The Thomistic position is briefly summarised (pp. 118-119), while the résumé of the Scotistic position fills, together with some concluding observations, an entire chapter (pp. 464-479). Among recent exponents of the Scotistic view Carol stresses the contribution made by "such intellectually robust thinkers" as Bonnefoy and Marshner. Against the Thomistic view that some passages of the New Testament, such as John 3: 16, clearly assign as finality to the Incarnation the redemption of humankind, the answer is that this is said affirmative, non exclusive, as is made clear by the Christological hymns in the Pauline Letters, such as Col 1: 15-20, where primacy is assigned to Christ, in accordance with God's pian, not only in the order of redemption but of creation as well. Carol considers that ali those theologians who state that Christ is intended by God as redeemer but do not explicitly add that he is only so intended, can legitimately be set on the side of Scotus; the case is similar to the formula "from the Father only" which defined Photius' separatisi view of the procession in God of the Holy Spirit. Having completed his lengthy dossier, mostly of Scotistic defenders — most of whom are only briefly recorded for sake of brevity — Carol observes: "Our synopsis yields a total of 1,486 authors. Of these, 307 have been categorised as Thomists, and 1,179 have been placed in the Scotist camp. The latter group is made up not only of Franciscans (530 authors), but also of members of various Religious Families (Jesuits, Benedictines, Carmelites, Mercedarians, etc.) and of the diocesan clergy, with several lay writers added. Non-Franciscan "Scotists" number 649. This significant fact should lay to rest the claim frequently made in some circles to the effect that the Scotistic theory is held only by Franciscans 'and a few others'" (pp. 467-468). He adds: "We should not, of course, indulge in the numbers game". But it is difficult to dispel the impression that this is just what the book is doing. Carol is probably right in dismissing as unsatisfactory the conciliatory theories or intermediate opinions which attempt to combine the two opinions in the hope of bringing out a conciliatory theory acceptable to both. But he seems unaware of the real possibility of overcoming the dilemma by transcending the problematic which pervades the entire debate. This would consist in squarely recognising, to begin with, that the Incarnation of the Word is not necessary on any account, but free on the part of God: it is so in the order of creation, as well as of self-communication, and even of salvation. What God seeks then in the Incarnation of his Son among men is neither merely to give nor merely to forgive — gift, self-gift and forgiveness can be conferred by God upon men without Christ. Rather, it is the immanence of his self-gift and pardon, their deepest</page><page sequence="14">726 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. possible insertion into the concrete, historical, reality of humankind. In Jesus Christ God has chosen to become God-for-men in a human fashion. This, as it could be shown, represents what is, in the last analysis, the meaning of Jesus Christ in God's pian for humankind; it also seems to make it possible to transcend a debate which otherwise rests on an inadequate basis. 3. Systematic Christology First published in 1982, the "Essay in Christology" of M. Serenthà has recently gone through a second, updated and revised edition7. It deliberately departs from the outdated methodology of pre-Vatican II text-books where Christology and soteriology were neatly distinguished, the first treating succes sively the two natures in Christ and their unity, the second centring on the atoning death on the cross and leaving little room for the resurrection. Now that the primacy of the history of salvation has been recovered, a new methodology has set in which insists on uniting once again Christology proper and soteriology; stress is being laid on the concrete historical dimension of the salvific event in Jesus Christ, which culminates in Easter. The new perspective marks a return to the biblical approach where the focusing centre is not the unity of divinity and humanity in Jesus Christ, but rather the continuity between the pre-Easter, earthly Jesus and the post-Easter, glorified Christ. The resurrection appears then as the superabundant fulfilment of the life and work of Jesus, the completion of the Incarnation. Serenthà bases his genetic method on Vatican II's Decree on Priestly Formation (OT, 16); hence his treatment's three parts: biblical, historical, and systematic. This genetic method, as is well known, after the Council has largely replaced the "dogmatic" one. But — it must also be added — it tends today to be in turn replaced by an inductive method and a hermeneutical approach to theology. In view of this, the perspective of the present work will appear to some already somewhat outdated. Central to the author's concern is the significance of the historical and of the historicity of the Christ-event. Thus, reviewing at the end of the historical part the recent Christological renewal (pp. 298-306), he devotes a section to Christologies within the framework of the problematic of history. Commenting earlier on the Christological developments of German Enlightenment philo sophers, he had adverted to the "problem of Lessing" and the questions raised by it: "the question is how can a concrete historical event, given its particular and contingent character, become a decisive point of reference for the inter pretation of ali reality" (p. 297). That which to Schelling appeared inconceivable is what Christian faith affirms of the Christ-event. In such a context, what Christology needs to show is the decisive value and universal significance, in the 7 Mario Serenthà, Gesù Cristo ieri, oggi e sempre.

It is not possible to follow in details ali the points developed in the hook, nor even its general structure; a few observations must suffice. Characteristical ly, Serenthà begins his treatment of biblical Christology with the "primitive professions of faith" as witnessed to by some passages from Paul's early epistles, but also — somewhat strangely — from the deutero-Pauline letters (!), to proceed next to the early apostolic kerygma, then back to the "Old Testament Perspectives", and again forward to the Christology of the Synoptics characte rised by the tension betweeri the earthly Jesus and the glorified Christ, foliowed in turn by the "Pauline" and "Johannine" Christologies. This complex structure allows the author to stress, on the one hand, that at the centre of the faith of the apostolic community stands an event, the climax of the history of salvation in which it is inserted, and on the other, the personal identity and hence the real continuity between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith, the eschatological transformation of Jesus' humanity brought about by the resurrection notwith standing. Between the message of Jesus and the message about Jesus, there is no rupture of continuity; nor is there a break in the New Testament between theology and economy, ontological Christology and soteriological or functional Cristology. Everywhere, moreover, the concrete history of Jesus is at the centre, even where the preexistence is affirmed. In the historical part, Serenthà shows that in the first centuries the perspective of the Fathers remains historical-salvific, again without a break between soteriology and Christology. However, while the ontological precisions introduced in the 4th and 5th centuries are legitimate developments, the historical dimension progressively recedes to the background, the theology becoming gradually isolated from the economy of salvation. The Chalcedonian formula witnesses to this tendency: its reading, more static than historical, consecrates the supremacy of metaphysics over functionality. Gradually, the concrete, real story of Jesus is overshadowed by formai ontological questions. In this context, the systematic part represents an effort — partly successful — to return to the economic-salvific perspective. The consideration of the mysteria carnis Christi, however brief, is a sign of this recovery. So is the discussion of the "absolute historicity" of the Christ-event (p. 407): ali dehistor icising attitude must be overcome radically (p. 410). The man Jesus, in his concrete human history, is the fulness of God's self-disclosure; hence the decisive significance of this particular historical event. The Christological titles, applied to Jesus by the apostolic Church, lead to the question of his personal identity beyond the titles. Ali merely functional interpretation, falling short of ontological affirmation, would therefore be reductive: being and acting, metaphysics and history, ontology and function are inseparable realities. The third chapter of the systematic part ends where the dogmatic method referred to ealier started: the only-begotten Son; trae man; and the mystery of the unity of Jesus Christ. The recent discussion of this last point is limited to a brief</page><page sequence="16">728 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. exposition of K. Rahner, P. Schoonenberg, H. Kiing and others. As for liberation Christologists, they figure nowhere in the book, except for a passing reference in a note (p. 307, note 18). H. Kiing published his magisterial book on the theological and Christologic ai thought of Hegel, entitled Menschwerdung Gottes, as early as 1970, that is four years before Christ Sein (1974) and eight years before Existiert Gotti (1978). The book, however, has only been made available in English in 19878. The jacket of the present edition welcomes Kiing's important work as represent ing the "theological foundations" of the two later books just mentioned. The subtitle of the work, "An Introduction to Hegel's Theological Thought as Prolegomena to a Future Christology", leaves no doubt about Kiing's own intention in the matter. This is made even clearer by the title of the eighth and last chapter of the book, "Prolegomena to a Future Christology", in which Kiing enters into a constructive criticism with Hegel regarding the foundations of a Christology of the future. Corning as it does after Kiing's own Christological works, the present review may dispense with a lengthy exposition of Hegel's theology and Christology, examining instead Kiing's dialogue with Hegel and suggesting what impact this dialogue has made on Kiing's later Christological writing. Kiing sums up clearly Hegel's fundamental concern when he writes: His concern, in which specifically theo-logical factors intersect with Christolo gical ones, is the dynamic unity of the living Godhead. The living God is for him the one who moves, changes and undergoes a history, who does not rigidly remain what he is, but becomes what he is. And he is the God who does not stubbornly remain within himself in a lofty posture of splendid isolation above the world, but comes out of himself and externalises himself in the beginning of the world, a movement which comes to a climax when God himself becomes man. According to Hegel, this God is the true, the Christian God (p. 433). Hegel's God, then, whom he identifies with the Christian God, is God becoming history, God in a process of becoming, of which the Incarnation is the supreme illustration. Thereby, two centrai issues of modem theology are raised: the historical side of God, and the historical humanity of Jesus. God's unchangeableness and immunity from suffering, traditionally borrowed by Christian theologians from Greek metaphysics, are put into question, as well as the two-natures model of Chalcedonian Christology. Is Hegel's philosophy Christian or not? Kiing refers to the specially severe critique of Eschenmayer (p. 419) and notes that, notwithstanding a recent tendency towards a less negative appraisal, scholars generally continue to 8 Hans KOng, The Incamation of God.

He himself, however, shares that criticism only to an extent. "What is at stake ... is Hegel's understanding of 'absolute Spirit'.... The basic issue can be posed at each of the countless stages of Hegel's dialectic of the Spirit.... It can be expressed ... as the question of the identity and non-identity of finite and infinite Spirit, God and man (world(K's italics) (p. 420). Kiing is of opinion that a renewed critical constructive dialogue with Hegel should result in formulating new questions — and perhaps answers — for Christology, without surrendering the specifically theological starting-point which is the Christian message. The provenance of Hegel's thought is, in fact, ambiguous; though not exclusively, it also draws on the Christian message. Nor is it easy to discover whether the impulses governing his thought, specially in Christology, are of Greek or Christian origin. Yet, Kiing notes, the same ambiguity is also found in the Christian Christological tradition. Hence, criticai reflection must be directed towards both, in view of a better understanding of each. The differences between Hegel's Christology and that of the originai Christian message ought not to be blurred: the ìrrevocable differ ence betwen God and man cannot be overlooked; nor can the free character as grace of every God-world occurrence. On the other hand, what is genuinely Christian in Hegel's starting-point must be recognised, as well as the possibility of holding fast to his essential insights while abandoning his system of identity in the sense of a monism of the Spirit. In fact, at the level of religion Hegel himself, for ali his unmistakable emphasis on unity, strongly maintained that there is an ultimate difference. Regarding the historicity of God, it would surely be irresponsible to challenge in Hegel's thought the possibility of divine becoming, self externalisation and suffering, while at the same time presupposing it in our own Christology. The Church's remoulding of the Greek philosophical concept of God, required by the biblical statements, often remained insufficient; the tension reached breaking-point on the question of the unity of Jesus with God. Similarly, the impassibility sometimes attributed to Christ, was a prolongation of the God of Greek metaphysics. The Christian message, however, affirms that God freely suffers in his Son, out of the fulness of his love. Nor must Father and Son be separated with respect to suffering. In sum, against the aloofeness of the God of philosophy, the God of Christian revelation identifies himself with man, while remaining God. He enters human history, not because this is rendered necessary by the dialectics of the Idea, but freely and for man's sake. In the humiliation of the Son, God does not reveal his lowliness, but his majesty. While for Greek metaphysics the Incarnation contradicts divinity, not so with the living God of the Bible for whom no loss of self is implied. Yet, the Incarnation being the self-externalisation of God, the Immutable in himself becomes subject to change. Should then God's transcendence, immutability and unchangeability be subjected to a thoroughgoing reinterpretation? Precisely because God is fulness devoid of want and immutable perfection, he can freely and out of grace enter into worldly change without surrendering his immutable divine perfection. The</page><page sequence="18">730 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. Christian message thus brings about a "sublation" of the metaphysical concept of God. According to Kiing, the dialectical dynamism of Hegel's concept of God is better suited to express what must be stated by a Christology thought through to the end, than is the Greek metaphysical concept of God — even while Hegel's monism of Spirit, with its ontic and noetic compulsion, which is the foundation of his system, is unacceptable. Hegel can help theology to avoid either cheaply and superficially harmonizing the 'God of the Fathers and of Jesus Christ' with the 'God of the philosophers', or else simply dissociating the two. The very possibility of a future Christology depends on the historicity of God — a concept emphasised by Hegel, even though in his system it needs the corrective of the biblical message. Coming to the historicity of Jesus, we note that the problem of the historicity of God leads to that of the historicity of Jesus. The first was initiated by Hegel's philosophy; the other, started by D.F. Strauss — who combined both — became one of the great, stili unresolved issues, of theology in the 19th and 20th centuries. Would it not be possible, Kiing asks, to start from the historicity and the historical facticity of Jesus, from his historical word, behaviour and fate, to understand how the reality of God is encountered in him? It seems appropriate to eschew a Christology organised speculatively and dogmatically from above in favour of one worked out historically from below. If there is 'no going back on Hegel' regarding the historicity of God, there is 'no going back on Strauss' regarding the historicity of Jesus. The post-Bultmannians have shown that, despite ali the difficulties, inference from the kerygma to the historical Jesus is possible, justified and necessary. Christology can therefore, in the reverse direction, follow the path from the history of Jesus to the Church's faith. The 'from above' approach has today become inaccessible and unfeasible for many; both the perceptions of modem exegesis and the modem understanding of history, the world and existence, urge a Christology 'from below'. The basic, primal and centrai datum of Christology is Jesus Christ himself, both the earthly, crucified Jesus and the risen Christ of the Church's kerygma. Wherever one of these constitutive data is lacking, Christology is impossible. A future Christolo gy must, moreover, differ from the customary scholastic and neo-scholastic Christologies in that it must be meta-dogmatic: conscious of the historical conditioning of dogma, it will eschew the method that starts from dogma in a deductive manner; rather it will take its point of departure from the historical Jesus in whom God spoke and acted in history. These last observations clearly prepare the way for Christ Sein, unmistak ably a Christology from below — with as its point of departure a historico-critical study of the earthly, historical Jesus. This is not the place to recali the criticism which has been levelled at that book for fading to reach up adequately from functionality to an ontological Christology — a failure only partially made good by the short Christological section of Existiert Goti? What must rather be asked is how Hegel's philosophy of the historicity of God which undoubtedly proceeds 'from above' can be seen as having paved the way for Kiing's later Christology</page><page sequence="19">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 731 'from below'. The preface to the present edition of Menschwerdung Gottes best provides the answer: "Hegel's modem philosophical-cum-speculative Christolo gy was not a genuine solution to the historico-critical questions concerning the person of Jesus Christ posed by the New Testament. This is why the Tiibingen figure of D.F. Strauss had to be contrasted with Hegel as an antithesis. He it was who, in a decisive way, connected the question of the historicality of God in the Hegelian speculative sense with the question of the historicality of Jesus in the historico-critical sense" (p. xi). Kiing adds: Beginnig with Jesus' proclamation, Jesus' conduct, and Jesus' fate, and pushing forward to the question of Jesus' significance, The Incarnation of God strove on a historico-critical basis to produce a 'Christology from below' which was then worked out in greater detail and placed before the public four years later in On Being a Christian.... Nevertheless, in the final analysis Hegel was spiritual godfather to On Being a Christian. For the intention of this book was precisely not to play off the 'God of Israel and Jesus' in a naive, biblicist manner against the 'God of the philosophers', but, on the contrary, to be on the lookout for dialectical connecting links. It entered a plea for the 'sublation', in the best Hegelian sense of the word, of the 'God of the philosophers' in the 'God of Israel and Jesus'" (p. xi). T. Sheehan's recent book on Christology9 bears the significant subtitle "How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity". Its thoroughly dubious starting point is the crisis which grows out of an alleged fact — "now freely admitted by both Protestant and Catholic theologians and exegetes" — that, "as far as can be discerned from the available historical data, Jesus of Nazareth did not think he was divine, did not assert any of the messianic claims that the New Testament attributes to him, and went to his death without intending to found a religion called 'Christianity'. That is, the theological crisis has to do with the prima facie discrepancy between what Jesus of Nazareth apparently thought he was (a special but very human prophet) and what mainline Christian believers now take him to be (the divine Son of God, consubstantial with the Father and the Holy Spirit)" (p. 5). Sheehan professes to follow the historico-critical method and to adopt the view-point of the historian — not of the believer; this, however, does not prevent him from avowedly using the scientific results of biblical scholarship "as data for my own theories" (p. 9). The result is a highly subjective misconstrual of the message of Jesus and of the origin of Christian faith — a case of looking into a well to see one's own reflection staring at one. That from Harnack's liberal interpretation through Bultmann and the post Bultmannians a complete circle has been made and the confidence recovered that the continuity can be shown between Jesus' own implicit Christology and the explicit Christology of the New Testament, does not disturb the author. For, what difference does it make? "Jesus' opinion of himself would have no binding power on anyone else, and so would make no real difference for faith" (p. 26). 9 Thomas Sheehan, The First Corning.

On such premises, his goal is "to contribute to the shaping of a postmodern and postliberal interpretation of the meaning of Jesus" (p. 27), by proposing his own understanding of the content of the Kingdom preached by him, of his resurrec tion, and of the development of the first Christologies. Amidst the explosion of apocalyptic hopes and the proliferation of eschato logical figures, Jesus' preaching of the Kingdom meant the intimate and immediate presence of God as a loving Father (pp. 59-60). The Reign of God, or "incarnation of God" refers to the "entirely human orientation of the Father", to his "incarnate presence" in and as neighbour (p. 61); charity fulfils the law, because it is the presence of God (p. 63); God's forgiveness is his self communicating incarnation (p. 66). Jesus is the locus, never the focus of the eschatological event (p. 76); ali Christological interpretation of his message is an extrapolation made after his death (p. 77). Before he died, "Jesus may have had intimations of being the long-awaited 'eschatological prophet'" and his disciples, even during his life-time, may have thought him to be so (p. 82); there is, however, disagreement whether he instituted a new liturgy in his farewell meal (p. 83). Given the fact that the Gospel accounts of Easter are myth and legend rather than historical accounts, what actually happened after the crucifixion? Sheehan's reconstruction of the events is based on an "ecstatic vision" of Peter who allegedly saw Jesus appointed Son of Man and destined to return in glory to usher in God's Kingdom (p. 105). Peter's vision is in terms of exaltation glorification; resurrection is a later interpretation (p. 108) coined in apocalyptic language where the term means "being definitively saved by God" (p. 112). The alleged appearances (p. 114) would better be termed revelations (p. 117). In every event, "when we search for the origins of Christianity, we find not an event that happened to Jesus after he died ("resurrection"), ... but only apocalyptic interpretations of an experience of Jesus that Simon and others claimed to have had" (p. 118). Peter passed from faith to doubt and loss of faith ("Denial"), and again to faith (p. 121). In fact, his failure was not in denying Jesus, but in believing too much in him, and placing him in the place of God and his Kingdom (p. 124). "Simon continued his denial of Jesus by creating Christianity.... He identified the man with a Kingdom that was not present but stili to come.... Henceforth, preaching the Kingdom of God-with-man meant preaching Jesus as the one to come.... 'Jesus' became a code word for the imminence of the eschaton.... Simon ... identified (the) future with the Jesus who he believed was soon to return" (pp. 125-126). Christianity is thus built on a mistake: it turned into apocalyptic eschatology the message of urgency and immediacy of Jesus the prophet. "Jesus' message, which had started as an invitation to live God's future in the present, devolved into a dogma about what had happened in the past. What began as a challenge to work God's mercy in the world was reduced to an apocalyptic myth" (p. 162). What then is the meaning of Easter? Sheehan distinguishes three positions: traditional, moderate, and liberal; his own inter pretation claims, while drawing from ali three, to go also beyond them (p. 165),</page><page sequence="21">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 733 by showing "that the Easter legends are not about the 'resurrection'; that they proclaim the fundamental datum of faith to be the absolute absence of Jesus; and that they show the futility of searching for Jesus at ali" (p. 166). From its Easter foundations upward, Christianity is caught in a hermeneutical circle, the problem lying in the insistence that ultimate meaning is bound up with Jesus. "The only way out of that problem is to surrender Jesus: to leave him dead and to see that the meaning of Jesus is that Jesus himself no longer matters" (p. 171). "The historical fact of the complete absence of Jesus does have religious significance: it means the end of religion" (p. 173). What remains is to seek meaning as he showed us to do, but without him. In the last part of the book Sheehan reconstitutes the process of 'diviniza tion' of Jesus which began after his death. According to him, as mentioned above, it is likely that, before he died, Jesus had come to believe he was the long-awaited eschatological prophet (pp. 177-178). The process of divinization took place by way of identification with the Kingdom which he had preached. Sheehan distinguishes three stages: the apocalyptic future (the Son of Man who will judge); the heavenly present (the reigning Lord and Christ); the Christolo gical past (the divine Son of God). The three stages correspond to the three cultural contexts encountered by Christian preaching: Jewish, Greek Jewish, and Greek. Between every two steps there is a "qualitative leap": first toward a Christology which remains adoptionist, then towards one which is incarnational and ontological. The conclusion is that the Christian interpretation of Jesus as Saviour is a distortion of his message in three major ways: the Kingdom of God became hypostatised in him; his own radicai sense of time was abandoned; religion of which Jesus had proclaimed the end was reconstituted. Christianity, Sheehan concedes, was one possible interpretation of Jesus; not, however, the only one, and arguably not the best one. To rediscover the Kingdom, we must not cling to Jesus as absolute law, but rather recover the question that Jesus was. Sheehan proposes to understand the message of the Kingdom without Christ and without Jesus. "Jesus is ultimately dispensable" (p. 224). He must be taken at his word. That means: living God's eschatological future in and as the worldly task of human liberation. "The decision is whether or not Christianity can dissolve itself in order to become what it is about" (p. 226)! Thus ends Sheehan's reinterpretation of Jesus, allegedly based on historical judgments which the author proffers in apodictic language, while at the same time professing that he often diverts from evidence to his own theories. The book is a strange mixture of false scholarship (renowned exegetes are often invoked in favour of minimising conclusions) and personal fantasy. As such it need not be refuted. Much of it is, in fact, reminiscent of things heard and refuted before, though Sheehan offers his own brand. The chief weaknesses of the work are his nontheistic interpretation of Jesus' message, its failure to appreciate Jesus' personal significance for his own preaching, its underestimat ion of the importance of Jesus' identification as the eschatological prophet, and his fanciful reconstruction of the Easter experience. These failures suffice by</page><page sequence="22">734 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. themselves to account for the complete break of continuity which Sheehan, in contradiction to present biblical scholarship, professes with such assurance between the Jesus of history and the Christ of Christian faith. 4. Liberation Chrìstology In 1976 Jon Sobrino wrote a first book on Chrìstology, made available in English translation under the title Chrìstology at the Croosroads: A Latin American Approach (London, SCM Press, 1978). Its title notwithstanding, it has been noted that this book remained to a considerable extent dependent on European Chrìstology, that of J. Motmann in particular. A South American colleague of the author suggested changing its subtitle to "A European Approach for Latin Americans" (J. Segundo, The Historical Jesus of the Synoptics, Maryknoll, Orbis Books, 1985, p. 190, n. 2). In spite of this, the book met with reactions and questions were addressed to its author. These had to do primarily with Sobrino's insistence on returning to the prepaschal Jesus to look for meaning in a liberation context; with the way he based the divinity of Christ (and the hypostatic union of his humanity to the Son) on his intimate relationship with the Father; with the question of Jesus' growth in Messianic and filial consciousness; with the interpretation and value of the Christological dogma of Chalcedon; etc. The present volume10, first published in Spanish in 1982, gathers various articies on Christological subjects, written by the author in the more recent years. The first part, made up of two chapters, is the most important. It is intended as a response to the reactions provoked by the first volume. Its purpose is to clarify reasonable doubts, to enrich and deepen Latin American Chrìstolo gy "through a more explicit referrai to Church tradition and dogma", while at the same time enriching the Christological tradition of the Church through Latin American Christology's contribution (p. 3, English edition). The first chapter is significantly entitled "The Truth about Jesus Christ" — with clear reference, it would seem, to Pope John Paul II's inaugurai address at the Puebla conference (1979). It treats, successively, the new situation in Christological reflection; the figure of Jesus Christ in Latin American Chrìstology; Jesus Christ true God; Jesus Christ, true human being; the mystery of Jesus Christ; faith in Jesus Christ. Lack of space makes it impossible to show how Sobrino succeeds in answering his critics. A quotation must suffice: The insistence of this (liberation) Chrìstology on the historical Jesus is not reductionistic and does not degenerate into a mere description of Jesus, such as lu Jon Sobrino, Jesus en Amérique Latine.

Rather it shows the emphasis of liberation Christology on the notion that in Jesus there has appeared both God's descent to human beings and the manner of human being's access to God. From a starting point in Jesus — out of his life, death, and resurrection — the Christology of liberation claims to show how the understanding of the human bcing, ■ the understanding of God, and the understanding of their mutuai relationship, can be 'Christianized' (p. 16, English edition). For further elaboration on Sobrino's elucidations, we may refer to J. Alfaro, "Analisis del libro 'Jesus en America Latina' de Jon Sobrino", Estudios ecclesiàsticos 59 (1984) 237-254; the same author also contributes a Foreword to the English edition (pp. ix-xiii). We may note a more definite Latin American accent in the second book — though the influence of European Christology, of Moltmann in particular, is stili perceptible throughout the volume. The volume's second and third parts treat of special topics, many of which were already touched upon in the previous book. We have thus: Jesus and the Kingdom of God; the epiphany of the God of life in Jesus of Nazareth; following Jesus as discernment; Jesus' relationship with the poor and outcast; "The risen one is the one who was crucified"; a crucified poeple's faith in the Son of God. The first book has shown the centrality in Sobrino's approach of the sequela Christi or discipleship, as the Christian praxis which is at the root of liberation Christology; the theme recurs here. It had also emphatically stressed that "salvation history is salvation in history", meaning that return to the prepaschal historical Jesus is the necessary foundation of Christology. This principle underscores the way in which Sobrino now conceives the progressive unfolding of Jesus' own revelation and of his followers' perception of his trae identity. This incomplete account suffices to indicate what Sobrino's second volume on Christology offers; it may perhaps be said that, while adopting the Latin American approach, Sobrino at the same time serves as a bridge with European Christology. This by itself is a worthwhile service, lest a break in communication between the different Christologies should result in mutuai estrangement. Leonardo Boff has to his credit several Christological writings, some of which have been gathered together in the Spanish edition under the title Jesucristo y la liberación del Hombre (Madrid, Cristiandad, 1981, pp. 670). The best known among these is probably Jesuscristo, liberador (1978) which for a long time has been available in several languages. However, in the opinion of J.L. Segundo who ranks among the most representative Latin American Christologists, this early work of Boff "suffers from the fact that it was his first work completed after his theological studies in Europe". In other words, it is not fully representative of a liberation Christological approach. The same writer goes on to observe: "I would say that the work most truly representative of a Latin American Christology is Boff s later work, Passión de Cristo (1981)" (J.L. Segundo, The Historical Jesus of the Synoptics, Maryknoll, New York, Orbis Books, 1985, p. 190, n. 2). It is this later work of L. Boff, recently published in</page><page sequence="24">736 JACQUES DUPUIS, S.I. English translation, which is under review here". This is not the place to substantiate Segundo's assessment or to show how the Latin American perspec tive has developed in Boff s Christological writing. Suffice it to indicate that this perspective — already evident in the title and subtitle — clearly stands out in the present volume. By exploring Jesus' Messianic consciousness, his attitude in the face of death, and the meaning he gives to his cross in assimilation of the will of God, Boff intends to help discover a meaning in the passion of those who suffer today in the world. He is aware of reading and understanding the Scriptures from the particular Sitz im Leben of an experience of oppression and a project of liberation. He does not claim his to be the only possible reading, but insists that no reading of Scripture can contend to be neutral. He professes that his interest in detecting the religio-political reasons that led to Jesus' trial and death "does not militate against a religious, transcendent meaning of the passion and death of the Lord, but only seeks to supply the dimension constituted by the historical, politicai mediations... of that religious, transcendent meaning" (p. 7). "My own approach is intended to be of assistance to readers who desire to sound the depths of the humanity of Jesus Christ, that they may find there a greater God and a nearer God, and that thereby they may feel themselves called to follow and imitate the same road and way of life that Jesus trod and lived" (p. 26). To this end, Boff seeks to discover Jesus' historical project and liberating praxis which ultimately is rooted in his new experience of God as Father. He further shows how this liberating praxis unavoidably led to his trial and violent death on the cross. Jesus became gradually aware of his coming end; his total and blind surrender to God in the face of death is part of the radicai fact of the Incarnation as God's "humanization to the hilt", as the complete and total divine emptying in the sense of Phil 2 (p. 52). To the question: What meaning did Jesus ascribe to his death?, Boff answers; "the one he ascribed to his life", that is, service to others (p. 63). Exegetes are not at one in thinking that he explicitly thought of it in terms of redemption. For Boff, Jesus' whole life is redemptive: "his death is redemptive only in its identity as part of his life"; it represented the apex of his pro-existence; he lived it as surrender to God and human beings, whom he loved to the end. But, it is Jesus' resurrection that revealed the ultimate meaning of his death; it showed that living for truth and justice is not meaningless and senseless, that the oppressed have a life reserved for them, the life that is being manifested in Jesus Christ through his resurrection. Boff next analyses the successive interpretations of Christ's death by the primitive Christian communities; death as the prophets' common destiny, death of the suffering servant, death as expiation and sacrifice. He subjects to "criticai analysis" three common representations by later theology of Christ's salvific " Leonardo Boff, Passion of Chrìst, Passion of the World.

Whatever their merit, these repre sentations tend to situate the redemption in the past: "Redemption enjoys no relationship with mediations in the present" (p. 89). In other words: how action for human liberation can be identified with Jesus' redemption, is not shown. Yet, for Boff what matters is to show Jesus' solidarity with suffering humanity, from which will flow the significance today of suffering for the sake of human liberation in union with Jesus. While stressing the solidarity of the dying Jesus with suffering humankind, he strongly disagrees with Moltmann's—and, to an extent, with Urs von Balthasar's—concepì of the Father's rejection of his Son and of his dramatic will of his Son's death. To posit such a loveless God in no way helps to enhance God's solidarity with human suffering. We must, indeed, move from the idea of an apathetic God to a pathetic God, who can suffer, for a God who cannot suffer cannot free us; yet, if God died, it is in obliquo, in the humanity of his Son. If God, as Moltmann would have it, were suffering in himself, there would be no way to overcome suffering, and no hope for suffering humanity : "If God were cross, then Jesus' redemption, Jesus' solidarity with the crucified of the world, would be meaningless. In order to suffer, God must assume the other-than-God" (p. 115). The cross, in fact, is sin and rejection of God out of man's freedom, but also freely assumed by God's Son in solidarity with and love for the crucified of history. "The cross is hatred destroyed by a love that takes up the cross and the hatred. This is liberation" (p. 116). It will be seen from this incomplete account that Boff has been faithful to the project he set himself in this book. Questions, no doubt, can be asked since, as Boff himself admits, his own reading of the Scriptures is not neutral. Perhaps one of the main questions would concern the meaning which Jesus himself attributed to his death, as it can be retrieved through criticai exegesis from the last supper narratives. Segundo is not the first liberation Christologist to write on the Christology of the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius of Loyola. In his Cristologia desde América Latina (1976) (English translation: Christology at the Crossroads, London, SCM Press, 1978), Jon Sobrino devoted a long appendix to the same topic. He concluded: "In exploring the Christ of the Ignatian Exercises, we must take cognizance of the limitations imposed by the mentality of Loyola's own age. We must carefully distinguish between his explicit affirmations and his implicit ones, for his most authentic intuitions are often to be found in the latter" (pp. 422-423, English edition). As will be seen here below, this conclusion may be looked upon as the basic guideline for Segundo's more elaborate treatment and thoroughgoing critique. The present book12 is Volume IV of J.L. Segundo's English Series "Jesus of 12 Juan Luis Segundo, The Christ of the Ignatian Exercises. Edited and translated from the Spanish b'y John Drury (Jesus of Nazareth Yesterday and Today, Voi. IV).

Nazareth Yesterday and Today", originally published in Spanish in three volumes under the general title El Hombre de hoy ante Jesus de Nazaret (1982). The connection between the various volumes is somewhat loose: the first, Faith and Ideologies, resumes and deepens the methodological questions already taken up in the author's previous Liberation of Theology, the second, entitled The Historical Jesus of the Synoptics shows the need to interpret the historical Jesus in a politicai key (which does not exclude the religious) (cf. Gregorianum 67 [1986] 551-552); the third, The Humanist Christology of Paul demonstrated through a study of Rom 1-9 that with Paul the interpretation of Jesus shifts to an anthropological key. The two added volumes mean to further show from concrete examples that different historical and cultural contexts have produced and continue to produce different interpretations of the same Christ, to each of which the appropriate key of reading must be applied. Hence the present volume on the Christ of Ignatius, which in turn will be followed by a last one entitled An Evolutionary Approach to Jesus of Nazareth. For a correct interpretation, the Christology of Ignatius needs therefore to be read against the background of the historico-cultural and religious context of Ignatius. The first thing which Segundo considers important to recali is the kind of monopoly which after the Council of Chalcedon a post-Chalcedonian Christological model has had for centuries. To this is to be attributed the fact that Ignatius' Christology remains very much a Christology from above, which takes its starting point in the person of the Son who became man, with the attendant risk of overshadowing the true human history of the man Jesus: post-Chalcedonian Christologies indulged in an "ahistorical" reading of Jesus (p. 39). Segundo further notes the conspicuous absence of Christological references in the "Principle and Foundation": praise and reverence are due to the Creator; even service does not refer to a divine historical pian in Jesus Christ, but expresses the obedience due to God's commandments without Christological reference. This "Christological vacuum" is not limited to a few words and expressions; "it is the overall structure of the Exercises, in its mechanisms and key moments, that manifests a theology which is consistent in this respect" (p. 50). Segundo defines what he means by this "Christological vacuum": It means "that theological elements, which should have been thoroughly and radically affected by Christology, were not affected by it at ali and remained unchanged" (p. 135, note 61). He then proceeds to substantiate this affirmation in many ways. In the Exercises Christology remains separate from the Trinity on the one hand, and from anthropology on the other. "Indifference" has no Christological content; when in the third degree of humility it turns into "preference", the undergirding Christology of the imitation of Christ bears the mark of Ignatius' time with the attendant contempi for the world. As to the ultimate criterion for the choice of a way of life, it too lacks explicit reference to any historical pian revealed in and through Christ. To a great extent the God of the Exercises is the God of the philosophers; even in the Final "Contemplation to Obtain Love", God is viewed</page><page sequence="27">ON SOME RECENT CHRISTOLOGICAL LITERATURE 739 solely as Creator. No doubt, the meditation of the "Kingdom of Christ" obtains a centrai place; but even here the reference is not to the historical Jesus through whom God's reign breaks through to human history, but to the exercise of kingship by the eternai King. Christ is not made to attract through the human historical project of the man Jesus, but through the divine strategy of the risen Lord. Even Jesus' cross is seen as having value in itself, not in relation to Jesus' human project faithfulness to which made it unavoidable. The Christology of the Exercises is thus not without ambiguity; it needs demythologising. This notwithstanding, it also contains precious threads, often remaining implicit, which if developed could become their most positive Christological data. These concern what Segundo regards as first steps in the "conversion of a static test Christology into a dynamic project Christology" (p. 114). He contends that there are relatively clear signs of such transformation in the later experience and writings of Ignatius as founder of the Society of Jesus. Thus he writes: As we move farther away from the epoch of the Exercises in the life of Ignatius Loyola, we find that the criteria for choosing that are given in the Exercises no longer govern the historical interpretation demanded by his task vis-à-vis the Society of Jesus. Ignatius now hears Jesus speaking to him from a place he had disregarded earlier: from the very history he was obliged to live; and in a world to be changed, the importance of which was being revealed to him more and more. Or, to put it more accurately, Ignatius tries to hear Jesus speaking to him from within history even when his theology fails to provide him with the mediations needed to decipher that historical key (p. 124). In fine, then, to continue today to make their traditional impact, the Exercises need to undergo a deep transformation; substantially, this would consist in a clear return to the Jesus of history and his historical project. The Christology from above of St Ignatius' time converted the conflict-ridden project of Jesus into an atemporal demonstration of the values that God wanted to impress upon us through his Son's accomplishment of our redemption. Segundo concludes; "Without a profound transformation of content and method the Ignatian Exercises... constitute a spirituality based on a Christology which today seems incomplete and incorrect, or, at the very least, opposed to clear-cut points in the theology of Vatican II and, in so far as Latin America specifically is concerned, the Medellin documents" (p. 111). This criticai evaluation will be challenged by many, unaware, perhaps, of how deeply Ignatius — like every man and theologian — was conditioned by his own time and culture. Others, more scholarly-minded, will question the foundations of Segundo's criticai appraisal, specially the alleged "Christological vacuum" of the Exercises; they will ask whether Segundo has taken note of the important studies made on the terminology of the Exercises (H. Rahner, and others) which have shown that in Ignatius' mind Christ is often present in the</page><page sequence="28">740 JACQUES DUPUIS, S I. Exercises where otherwise he would go unsuspected. Yet, if criticai remarks are called for, it remains true that in view of the cultural gap between Ignatius' time and Christology and our own, a reinterpretation of his fundamental experience and of his basic insights is called for, in order that the Spiritual Exercises may remain what their author meant them to be.
