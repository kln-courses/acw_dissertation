<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fragments of Redemption: Reading William Gaddis' JR GREGORY COMNES In JR the expression "agape agape" does more than entitle character Jack Gibbs's unfinished work; it underscores the conditions that frame the basic question William Gaddis' second novel poses to both its characters and readers, "what's worth doing": how the recovery of meaning and value is possible, at what cost and by what means, within the morally bankrupt and socially entropic landscape the novel presents.' Answering this question is difficult, especially when one realizes that Gaddis gives no warrant for belief in conventional aesthetic solutions. The plot line of JR consists of a conflict between two subtexts-finance and art. In the corporate world of JR, where all monetary worth exists on paper, the shadow of paper instruments has so obscured traditional value structures that depreciation has become the touchstone of worth. Gaddis is not simply offering commonplace moralizing about the evils of money, however, since the distorted relationship between means and ends in JR is not only monetary but aesthetic. Artists talk incessantly about projects that would redeem their world from venality, but these same artists fail to produce anything worth doing, anything that would confer credibility upon their intentions. Gaddis not only critiques conventional aesthetic solutions within the novel; he sets this critique in a narrative form that dramatizes it. What the novel says about art is mirrored by how the novel says it, issuing forth a "form" that intractably resists conventional aesthetic means of interpretation. JR makes no concessions to fictional continuity; its linguistic patterns never assume narrative coherence because the conventions used to signify such patterns are absent. The novel is 726 161</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE pages of unmediated dialogue: there are no chapters, no paragraphs, and very few complete sentences. Its prevailing mark of punctuation- the ellipsis-emphasizes the absence of explicit interchange, as unidentified speakers are inevitably interrupted by other voices competing for the same space on the page. BecauseJR neither describes locale nor provides discursive transitions, scenes are not set in the novel; they occur, while the identification of topics, never mind their relative significance, is left totally to the reader. As it does through the content, the form of JR continuously reminds its readers that they will be frustrated so long as they rely on conventional aesthetic means of recovering meaning from it. Because JR offers so little in the way of structural coherence and narrative line, one can sympathize with George Steiner's complaint that "this unreadable book will humiliate, confound, and mock the reader"-sympathize, but not agree.2 In contrast to Steiner's premise that the unconventional narrative mocks the reader, I would argue that Gaddis creates his "unreadable" text to instruct the reader, to teach him through unconventional narrative how to understand in an unconven- tional way "what's worth doing." In JR both the method and the message of this instruction emerge through the oblique allusions the novel makes to Walter Benjamin. In his reflections on culture and tradition Benjamin mirrored Gaddis' belief that in a society dominated by capitalistic institutions the power of art to redeem worth had eroded: the secular cult of beauty and the authenticity of the cultic art work to present it were irrelevant in a world Benjamin saw as a "phantasmagoria" of historicism and the bland culture of progress, a deceptively connected superstructure of "worth" built on the debris and rubble of traditional cultural value.3 But while Benjamin renounced what he called the "auratic" nature of art, its status as a unique work that could present truth apart from the state and society, he did not reject the role of the artist.4 Embedded in the ruins of modern culture were "thought fragments" of truth that survived the perils of progress. In this context the role of the author became that of an "archaeologist of ruins," one whose task was to excavate these fragments, "to wrest the elements of a work from their false context and to reconstruct them in a new one in such a way that the original hidden truth of the work is revealed."5 Benjamin described this procedure as "politicizing aesthetics," a procedure that did not involve the contem- plative artist reassembling value outside society, but the collaborative artist exploiting society's means of production, subverting false 162</page><page sequence="3">READING WILLIAM GADDIS' JR structures by illuminating truth through fragments which themselves remained unconnected, ever open to new possibilities of disclosure. In Benjamin's modern world of commodity fetishism, worth no longer exists in the inherent value of the aesthetic object, since the object itself is described by Benjamin as not "in truth."6 Instead, aesthetic "worth" becomes synonymous with and contingent upon the responsible action of the artist who recovers and displays these fragments: "what's worth doing" becomes in large part the doing itself. To convey this idea to its reader, JR does not preach Benjamin's ideology; instead Gaddis moves the reader from abstract to concrete understanding of this unconventional aesthetic by requiring him to "politicize the aesthetics" of the novel: to use this view as the means of recovering narrative meaning. Because JR molds its language to reflect Benjamin's phantasmagoric world of depreciated value within which are embedded fragments of truth, the reader discovers this method as he works out the linguistic perplexities he encounters, attesting to its tenets by actively engaging in the novel to excavate meaning from it. Reading JR leaves little doubt that any excavation of worth requires diligent spadework; almost every contextual and structural occurrence in the book is littered with the debris of depreciated and distorted values, both financial and artistic. Throughout JR the distortion of worth by financial community is symbolized by paper money, a symbol present from the opening lines of the novel: -Money . . .? in a voice that rustled. -Paper, yes. -and we'd never seen it. Paper money. -We never saw paper money till we came east. -It looked so strange the first time we saw it. - Lifeless. -You couldn't believe it was worth a thing. (p.l) These lines suggest two attitudes toward what historians refer to as "the paper money complex."7 The first attitude acknowledges an important point in the debate about the relative worth of coined versus paper money, specifically that paper money was only a symbol, counted for nothing as a commodity, and was thus rightly judged to be the "worthless" material Edward Bast's aunts deem it to be.8 In the traditional economic system of commodity exchange, two types of money, paper and gold, are clearly disassociated, and it is only the imagination of the capitalist that turns paper "sign" into a valuable substance.9 163</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE The transference of money's power from the realm of commodity to the realm of the capitalist's imagination is reinforced in the lines' allusion to a modern version of Wagner's The Rhinegold, one in which commercial paper has replaced the ring of the Nibelungs as the source of societal regeneration. To understand this second allusion, the reader must recall that the opening bars of The Rhinegold consist of a prolonged E-flat in the lower orchestral register, a sound, Wagner told Liszt, which embraces "The beginning and end of the world."10 The source of the E-flat and Wagner's concept of how that tonic might manifest itself in future generations are most revealing to the present discussion of the status of paper money in JR. Wagner's account of his mental state when the inspiration for the E-flat motif came to him is as follows: I suddenly experienced a feeling as if I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. Its rustling [italics mine] noise soon presented itself as the musical sound of the E-flat major chord ceaselessly rocking away in broken figures; these broken figures showed themselves as melodic passages of increasing movement, but the pure E-flat major triad never changed and seemed to wish to give the element in which I stand infinite significance." Later in life Wagner addressed another power that he also felt to be protean in its manifestations: Though much that is ingenious and admirable has been thought, said, and written concerning the invention of money, and of its value as an all-powerful cultural force, nevertheless the curse to which it has always been subject in song and story should be weighed against its praises. There gold appears as the demonic throttler of mankind's innocence; so too, our greatest poet [Goethe] has the invention of paper money take place as a devil's trick. The chilling picture of the spectral ruler of the world might well be completed by the fateful ring of the Nibelung as a stock portfolio.12 In JR's world the fundamental "rustling chord" Wagner describes is now the rustling voice of paper money described by Bast's aunt; paper money, as Wagner predicted, has become the new "Ring." Similar references to a Wagnerian landscape transformed into a capitalistic Valhalla appear throughoutJR, Wagner's theme of the consequences of renouncing spiritual love for power functioning as the scaffolding for the events in the novel. However, in contrast to Wagner's conception of greed as a privation of love, a privation that is doomed to failure, the greed in JR is Manichaean in its manifestations and appears to have thus avoided the Gotterdammerung, the fate that Wagner predicted for a world bereft of love. To this extent, the Ring motif in JR is less Wagner's 164</page><page sequence="5">READING WILLIAM GADDIS'JR and more G. B. Shaw's. As Shaw pointed out in The Perfect Wagnerite, he considered the catastrophic close of Wagner's Ring an "operatic anachronism."13 In contrast, Shaw's modernized scenario has Alberich rethink his threat to dethrone Wotan. Instead, Alberich marries into the best Valhalla families and restores his self-respect by succeeding on such a grand scale that he is transformed into a "Krupp of Essen or Carnegie of Homestead," the type of capitalist that Shaw believed would save Europe.14 In sum, the ideological significance of the opening lines of the novel combines the tendency of paper money to distort man's natural understanding of the relationship between symbol and value with the idea of a capitalistic Alberich who succeeds in a world without love to suggest that in this novel the world of finance has transcended the conventional demands and limits of society. InJR, economic rights are anterior and independent of social ones, the symbol no longer needing justification before a moral tribunal. Capitalists who see things "from a corporate level" (p. 23) do not confuse monetary and moral purpose, a point brought home by the repeated allusions to excrement in the novel. The fact that most business deals in JR are conducted in or near toilets and that the prototypical tycoon JR has for his leitmotiv the phrase "Holy Shit" quite deliberately points to Freud's notion of the fetishistic connection between money and feces. With a backward glance to Gaddis' punning point in The Recognitions that reality is Recktall Brown, Gaddis uses money as "Holy Shit" to remind the reader that corporate success involves accepting the pathological and destructive nature of money and acting on it, disregarding any attempt to justify the activity of making money in any moral sense. Free of any sense of social obligation that would involve restriction or sacrifice to a higher good, the corporate world dissolves moral principles into a choice of expediencies. This is the world bereft of love, the world in which moral belief is absent and economic "shitting" is the only operant force. To be sure, the consequences of these perverted values are horrific and absurd: the use of radioactive cobalt to make "improved" heads for beer (p. 435), recycling of condoms as flutes in pianos (p. 532), and selling of toy weapons to an African revolutionary army that results in its annihilation (p. 709). The corporate world is pathological and destructive, Gaddis shows us, because it has totally separated itself from any moral "commodity" that might restrict its growth. Despite its corrupt nature, however, JR's corporate sensibility is a palpable source of power in contemporary society, and to restore any sense of human 165</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE value or higher purpose to this society, it becomes clear that this moral bankruptcy must be confronted. In JR the task of confronting the perversions of corporate America is given to the artist; however, he is not up to the task. To depict the failure of art, Gaddis continues to draw from the Ring, cataloging individual artists as failed, reduced versions of Norse gods. The musician Edward Bast is a bast(ard) and so an embodiment of both Siegmund and Siegfried; but instead of doing battle with the forces of darkness, Edward is depicted as a slave of corporate business, managing JR's affairs while at the same time wasting his musical talent on "Zebra Music" promotional films. Tom Eigen, an author who has written a book much like The Recognitions, is now creatively impotent, a "writer who's run out of agape" (p. 282), presumably a reference to the love that could restore the ring, while fellow writer Jack Gibbs's constant refrain "God damned" serves as Gaddis' comment on the debased spiritual condition of JR's capitalistic Valhalla. The characterizations of artistic failure are later codified by what Gibbs calls the "tiirschluss [shut door] syndrome beginning to see the doors closing all sad words of tongue or pen to see the same God damned doors Schramm saw closing . ." (p. 493). Schramm, a painter who commits suicide, becomes the focus of Gaddis' attacks on the sensibility of any artist who gives into the "tiirschluss syndrome," a setting in of a "paralysis of will" (p. 492). As Gibbs describes Schramm's fate: Problem what happened he always woke up the same person that went to bed the night before only way he knew it these God damned words going through his head, go to bed know he'd wake up the same God damned person finally couldn't take it anymore, same God damned words waiting for him only thing to do get rid of the God damned container for the thing contained, God damned words come around next morning God damned container smashed on the sidewalk no place for them to.... (p. 283) The deficiency Schramm exhibits is the same inability to act that Eigen experienced, a condition where he "-finally found everything around him getting so God damned real he couldn't see straight long enough to write a sentence" (p. 492). Instead, Schramm, Eigen, and the rest of the artists in JR fall victim to searching for something worth doing, something that forever eludes each of them and ultimately destroys Schramm. As Gibbs tells Eigen later in the novel, Schramm's problem wasn't sexual impotence; it was spiritual impotence: "-Christ look, can't you see it wasn't any of that? It was whether what he was trying to 166</page><page sequence="7">READING WILLIAM GADDIS' JR do was worth doing even if he couldn't do it? Whether anything was worth writing even if he couldn't write it? Hopping around trying to redeem the whole God damned thing" (p. 621). Schramm's penchant for redemption echoes that of Wyatt Gwyon, the protagonist of The Recognitions. However, in JR, Thoreau's doctrine of simplifying that was espoused in The Recognitions is no longer tenable as a means of salvation in the corporate world; instead the doctrine has been reduced to a slogan of the slithery lawyer Crawley, one who reduces Thoreau's idea to facile advice: "And one word of advice, clear your head and get down to one thing. Hello . . .? Yes simplify Mister Bast. Simplify" (p. 449). Instead of simplifying their world, however, the artists in JR are adept only at creating chaos. Unable to combat the venalities of the corporate world, the artists in JR perceive themselves to be in an entropic state, a condition in which order, as Gibbs lectures his students, is but a convenient fiction, "simply a thin, perilous state we try to impose on the basic reality of chaos ... (p. 20). The notion of order as a "perilous condition" is further reinforced when Gibbs complains about how impossible it is to communicate with his ex-wife, a complaint that in fact defines what communication theory calls "informational entropy": "whole God damned problem listen whole God damned problem read Wiener on communication, more complicated the message more God damned chance for errors" (p. 483).15 The chaotic, entropic world of the artist is concretized by the description of the Ninety-sixth Street flat, an enclave, a haven where these artists retreat, ostensibly to create. The reality of the flat, however, is chaos. Crates of "Mazola #24"-the detritus of one of JR's corporations-sully and obscure the artists' texts. All the manuscripts in the flat-Bast's music, Gibbs's and Eigen's writing-are in states of disrepair. As Gibbs describes this chaos, "there's too God damned much entropy going on" (p. 287). Jack Gibbs should know, since he gives voice to the clearest expression of how impotent artists are in the face of the depreciation of order. Believing that he has leukemia, Gibbs argues that his cancer extends to language, specifically his book, which remains unfinished after sixteen years of work. As Gibbs describes it, "-it's like living with an invalid real God damned terminal case, keep hoping he'll pick up his bed and walk like the good book says" (p. 248). Four hundred pages later, however, the reader of JR realizes that Gibbs's book will remain both an invalid and in-valid, incapable of providing an antidote to the toxins of corporate America. In so describing his work, Gibbs enacts his preciously romantic 167</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE belief that art cannot flourish in the midst of a chaotic, entropic society. As Gibbs quotes from his book, "all art depends upon exquisite and delicate sensibility and such constant turmoil must be ultimately destructive" (p. 289). The true reason for this destruction, however, is not the delicate and exquisite nature of art so much as it is the failure of artists in JR to recognize that there can be no art until someone makes it, whatever may be the obstacle. The artists intellectualize and complain about the depreciation evident in society, yet keep themselves paralyzed by waiting for "something worth doing" to motivate them. JR does not confine itself to exposing the weakness of art, however, for while it leaves its characters trapped in a conceptual cul-de-sac, the novel also shows the reader the way out. If JR forces the reader to realize that conventional wisdom about the efficacy of art is inadequate, the novel also presents him with unconventional wisdom by providing the reader with the means to change his role from conceptual analyst to experiential participant, a role that teaches him that it is his own collaboration that imparts significance to the text. The first clue is provided by Jack Gibbs's unfinished work entitled ". .. something agape I think it was . . ." (p. 282), or as the reader later discovers, "agape agape" (p. 604). Gibbs's book "about random patterns and mechaniza- tion" (p. 147) is not a novel but "more of a book about order and disorder more of a social history of mechanization and the arts, the destructive element . . ." (p. 244). Gibbs identifies this element as the problem of eliminating failure; democracy's promise, reviving a term used in The Recognitions, is "to banish failure to inherent vice" (p. 571): "shoot the God damned piano that's what it's about just told you, player piano play by itself get to shoot the pianist just read it God damn it says it right here, here where the invention was eliminating the very possibility of failure as a condition for success" (p. 604). To the careful reader, Gibbs's statements suggest several points. Gibbs acknowledges that the theme of his book is explicitly related to Oscar Wilde's notion of the relationship of democracy, technology, and art. Paraphrasing Wilde, Gibbs ironically notes that the "frail human element [which] still abounded even in the arts" was usurped by the "saving grace" of the machine: "deliverance was at hand, born of the beasts with two backs called arts and sciences whose rambunctious coupling came crashing the jealous enclosures of class, taste, and talent, to open the arts to Americans for democratic action and leave history to bunk" (p. 289). The thematic concerns of the agency of the artist and the influence of technology on art also allude, in an oblique way, to two 168</page><page sequence="9">READING WILLIAM GADDIS'JR works more pertinent to the themes of random patterns and mechanization in the arts, Walter Benjamin's essays "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" and "The Destructive Character."16 The connection is far greater than merely a similarity in phrasing between these titles and what Gibbs's book is about, however, for Gaddis uses Benjamin in JR to teach readers how failure can function as the necessary precondition for "success," specifically for the recovery of an understanding of "what's worth doing" in JR. Benjamin's status is enigmatic: he is a Marxist critic whose theories, as Christopher Norris describes them, "are rife with contradiction and paradox but freed from the narrowing rationalist dogma" of "enlightened" Marxist thinking, which Benjamin saw drawing a too facile equation between knowledge and progress.17 Instead Benjamin formulated a fitful kind of Marxism incorporating a "catastrophist" philosophy of history, one where beliefs are kept alive precisely by renouncing progress and history. The present world, Benjamin argues, is lost to truth, for history is always written by the oppressors of true enlightenment. In modernity Benjamin saw the oppressor as capitalism, "a natural phenomenon with which a new dreaming sleep came over Europe and with it a reactivation of mythical forces," in this instance the forces of technology, commodity fetishism, and the distorted social relationships they generated.18 Like the younger Marx's, Benjamin's aim was "waking the world from its dream about itself." However, what is needed to change this situation is not simply a worker's revolution, as conventional Marxism holds, but a total revolution, a revolution of consciousness. These tendencies crystallize in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," where Benjamin discussed the impact of technological changes and social transformations on aesthetic percep- tion and the modes of aesthetic production. In modern society Benjamin identified reality as artifice: an amalgam of commodities and architectural construction made possible by industrialization. Benjamin stressed that this artifice was Nature, a concrete realization (in concrete) of society's dream rather than simply a reified expression of that dream. In an industrialized world of commodity production art, too, has become a commodity with what Benjamin termed "exhibition" value, the "shock of the new" that was the province of mass-produced art. The socioeconomic realities of the twentieth century had demonstrated to Benjamin the bankruptcy of the aesthetic approach as a means of ideological intervention: the power of money and capitalism being far too pervasive to be transformed by any intellectual love of beauty. But if 169</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE the emergence of the "exhibition" value of art led to a crisis in aesthetic perception, it also left open the possibility for emancipation: freeing art from the realm of shopworn ideas and cathartic experiences to one of critical cultural argument. In such a climate, the task of the artist became not to represent the artifice that had become reality, but to expose to people how and why artifice had become reality. Benjamin described this as the movement from "aestheticizing politics" (raising the mundane to art, for Benjamin the essence of fascism) to what he termed "politicizing aesthetics," reviving art in the twentieth century by acknowledging its status as a product, then integrating the means of production with human concerns through collaborative activity.19 As Benjamin writes: A writer's production must have the character of a model: it must be able to instruct other writers in their production and secondly, it must be able to place an improved apparatus at their disposal. This apparatus will be better the more consumers it brings into contact with the production process-in short the more readers or spectators it turns into collaborators.20 Benjamin's concept of a collaborator, an active agent of transformation, is reinforced when one considers Benjamin's distinction between the nature of knowledge and the nature of truth, a distinction made manifest in terms of how the reader must transform the material presented to him. Knowledge, Benjamin believed, was amenable to systematic statement and theory, a style that required no active participation by the reader. Truth, in contrast, rejected a sequence of ordered presentation, requiring instead a disjunctive, fragmented style with which the reader, as Benjamin wrote, "must stop and restart with every sentence."21 Benjamin called the technique of presenting the truth in this manner plumpes denken, or "crude thought," the utilization of "thought fragments" whose power was "not the strength to preserve but to cleanse, to tear out of context, to destroy the 'illusion of history.' "22 Benjamin made extensive use of "thought fragments," particularly quotations, but not as conventional illustrations for a text. Instead his intention was to create a text made up entirely of fragments, an intention Theodore Adorno described as "the attempt to abandon all apparent construction and to leave its [the text's] significance to emerge solely out of the shock-like montage of the material."23 The intent, as Benjamin made clear, was to disrupt: "Quotations in my works are like robbers by the roadside who make an armed attack and relieve the idler of his convictions."24 Benjamin also stressed the necessary obliquity of these fragments, stating that "the value of fragments of thought is all 170</page><page sequence="11">READING WILLIAM GADDIS' JR the greater the less their direct relationship to the underlying idea."25 The key to understanding does not lie with that which is immediately given, but instead in being able "to read what was never written."26 The reader breaks into the "discontinuous structure of the world to reveal from behind the piles of refuse ... small material particles that indicate what is essential."27 This approach, as Benjamin describes it in "The Destructive Character," requires that one break up the world and its "wish-symbols." But, "he reduces what exists to ruins, not in order to create ruins, but in order to find the way that leads through them."28 To understand this approach more clearly, consider Benjamin's use of the "thought fragment" technique in his Theses on the Philosophy of History, a sequence of eighteen aphoristic statements that, while nominally pessimistic, can also be read as redemptive parables, what Adorno called Benjamin's goal of presenting "the paradox of the possibility of the impossible."29 The Theses critiques belief in any historical system-including Marxist historical materialism-that equates the goal of history with the end of time. In rejecting teleology as a basis for understanding, however, Benjamin also affirms the messianic belief in the illumination of truth in the moment, an illumination provided by the fragments that compose the Theses, wherein theory suddenly stops "in a configuration pregnant with tensions."30 In such fragmentary configurations one sees the chance, as Benjamin describes it throughout the Theses, to "blast" a specific moment of truth from the otherwise banal and homogeneous course of history. The same concern with fragments also seems to inform Gibbs's writing. Apart from his citations from Wilde, Gibbs exhibits a fascination with epigraphs. Listed on page 486 of JR and reproduced below, the thematic link among these epigraphs parallels Benjamin's focus on the dual themes of human desolation and utopian ideals. Gibbs describes the quotations as "mere trash," but Gaddis' purpose of turning the reader into a Benjamin-like collaborator is nonetheless strengthened by their presence. Gibbs asks Amy, "-what are there about a dozen?" (p. 487), but in fact there are eighteen, the same number as in Benjamin's Theses. (Although nineteen are listed inJR, the fourteenth duplicates the second. Note also that the numbers in brackets and "&lt;" marks on the copy of page 486 [reproduced below] are mine, not Gaddis'.) The point is not to compare the two sets of thought fragments directly, but rather to note the possibility of recognizing in JR the same formal and thematic concerns found in Benjamin. Quotations in JR more directly related to Benjamin's concept of thought fragments are found on page 587, also reproduced here. 171</page><page sequence="12">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE JR tII $wsw" rtvt n&amp;wu Jciie L *JC&lt; &amp;-t4Asia wwj idfeafwf ec ' re", ( RSe wy e -canYtiiIn u ti eusrse(wsv us, .( ? ft, e"J,, ,a ll u w, ,t, k .p.a ,,,. .,,,'.D , Tof ,siulr, Au arfs to k S MA'r, sw '!Ti}r ^ ^'Jf tm4t'&lt;6pjrair.syat?Unllt t(i1i$v (l.M.tsTOru) 11. ?'untE: that .....k as error t.e traw(atioi r-1 S tm^W - eoqrowit au "A 4ffw4t tAing wtic Ja w uMrrAerz (ttZMIIOWAv ?)

Art is certainly understood to have "exhibition" value in JR, a value expressed by Major Hyde when he tells Gibbs where art comes from: -Get it? Art? You get it where you get anything you buy it ... don't try and tell me in this day and age there isn't enough around for everybody great art, pictures music books who's heard all the great music there is you? You read all the great books there are? seen all these great pictures? records of any symphony you want reproductions you can get them that are almost perfect, the greatest books ever written you can get them at the drugstore. (p. 48) In Hyde's corporate world of perverted values art has become a commodity of "drugstore masterpieces," part of what Gibbs describes as the "God damned Protestant ethic [a reference to Weber's "capitalist spirit"] can't escape it have to redeem it" (p. 477). The means of redemption, as Gibbs tells Amy, requires the type of change Benjamin advocated, a change of contexts: "-I mean sometimes there are situations that just don't seem to have a solution in their own context do you, do you see what I mean? And the only way to, the only thing to do is step in and change the whole context" (p. 496). While Gibbs cannot act on his own advice, his remarks provide important clues to the reader. Since JR exhibits the distorted structures and bankrupt values of capitalism described by Benjamin and since the novel resists conventional aesthetic interpretation, the task of the reader is to "blast" from the "bunk" of the novel's encrusted contexts of false value fragments that illuminate an understanding of worth heretofore hidden. In this context JR's allusions to Hermann Broch's Sleepwalkers are revealing (pp. 629, 724). Like Benjamin, Broch believed the role of art was to reveal the means by which man could recover a sense of value in a fragmented world.31 By radically revising narrative style to mirror discoveries in the new physics, Broch created what he called "epistemological novels," works in which the active participation of the reader in constructing meaning became the primary issue.32 Jack Gibbs gives voice to this idea when he states "don't bring a God damned thing to it can't take a God damned thing from it don't know something look it up" (p. 605). Ironically, the fact that Jack Gibbs has been reading the 174</page><page sequence="15">READING WILLIAM GADDIS' JR same page of the Sleepwalkers for two hours suggests that he is unable to take his own advice, that he cannot take the responsibility of active participation of narrative construction Broch required. In reading the "epistemological novel" JR, the reader faces the same dilemma: either participate in the construction of the text's meaning, or else be condemned to endlessly read JR's "same page" of verbal noise. The allusion to Broch underscores what the allusions to Benjamin point out. Rather than try to "aestheticize" the paper money world of the novel, as the artists of the novel try and fail to do, the reader can "politicize" aesthetics, take art into the world of action by carefully considering oblique allusions-indirect and therefore more valuable-as possible sources for illuminating "what's worth doing" in JR. Examined carefully, JR yields a series of intricate connections concerning fragments in the complementary context Benjamin accords them, connections that aid the reader in the understanding and experience of "politicizing aesthetics." For example, early in JR there is an expressed concern over an inscription engraved in the front of Gibbs's school. The inscription resists translation, although Gibbs drops some hints to the reader that it might be from Empedocles: "-I think it's a fragment from the second generation of his cosmology, maybe even from his first" (p. 45). The reference to Empedocles seems to satisfy most characters in the novel. Later, however, the reader finds that it was Schepperman the painter who engraved it, an engraving Gibbs describes as one of Schepperman's attempts to make a statement that people could see: "-Schepperman God damned statements still got one of his God damned statements carved in stone over the God damned front door, God damned school board find it's Karl Marx" (p. 409). Disguised by little "curlicues" added to the letters (p. 457), the statement is indeed a fragment, but not from Empedocles. Turning back to the fragments on page 20, if the reader shifts his perspective, he can recognize the obscured letters of "from each according to ..." The implications are complex and fascinating. By first providing a supposed reference to Empedocles, himself a believer in destruction as the precondition for meaning (actual fragments of Empedocles' Fragments appear on pages 45, 161, and 406), Gaddis nudges the reader into discovering the real significance of the quotations. The reference to Marxism (from each according to his ability to each according to his need) reminds the reader that systems opposing JR's capitalistic money game can exist. More importantly, however, the reference reinforces the significance of Walter Benjamin's "messianic transcience," his vitalist revision of Marxist materialism 175</page><page sequence="16">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE which in the context of reading JR means actively engaging the novel's verbal "means of production," taking on fragments such as Schepper- man's, fragments that the reader himself must "wrench" into a previously undisclosed context that confers meaning. This technique is particularly useful when applied to the subject of entropy, which as previously mentioned appears to symbolize a predetermined state of inevitable chaos that permeates both the lives of the artists in the novel and the reader's attempts to structure them. In so viewing such chaos, however, Gibbs, Eigen, and the nonattentive reader miss Gaddis' covert message that entropy is not determined, a function of the cosmos, but is instead a result of choices man himself makes about the possibility of order. Two fragments from JR corroborate this interpretation of entropy's function in the novel. First, the name Jack Gibbs must be a reference to Josiah Willard Gibbs, the nineteenth-century American physicist/chemist so beloved and so misunderstood by Henry Adams.33 Jack Gibbs's negative interpretation of entropy, while in line with Adams' idea of the heat death of the universe, is at odds with Willard Gibbs's own pronounce- ments on the subject. Specifically, when Willard Gibbs established probability as a fundamental concept of physics, he was not reducing the concept of significant ordered action to the "perilous condition," Jack Gibbs tells his class. Instead, Willard Gibbs revised the relationship between order and disorder, suggesting that "the impossibility of an uncompensated decrease of entropy seems to be reduced to improba- bility," that irreversibility of increasing disorder was not a given.34 The clearest explanation of Gibbs's ideas was put forth by scientist E. T. Jaynes. Noting the usefulness of Gibbs's formulations, Jaynes declared "that even at the purely phenomenological level, entropy is an anthropomorphic concept. For it is a proposition, not of the physical system, but of the particular experiments you or I choose to perform on it."35 Willard Gibbs provided the insight that entropy is not an independent entity threatening man's existence but an anthropomor- phic tool, one that offers answers, especially in the application of thermodynamics to chemistry, unforeseen in antecedent theories. The second fragment concerns the reader's willingness to take seriously Jack Gibbs's suggestion to "read Wiener on communication" (p. 483). "Wiener" is a reference to Norbert Wiener, pioneer in the field of cybernetics, or the theory of codes and their discernment within a state of informational entropy.36 When Jack Gibbs complains about the possibility of increased error in complicated messages, he underscores the relationship between complexity and unpredictability in communi- 176</page><page sequence="17">READING WILLIAM GADDIS'JR cation. What Jack Gibbs leaves out is the other side of the coin of information theory: the more recognizable the message the more banal and predictable it is, in effect replacing error with emptiness. More importantly, Jack Gibbs fails to consider what information theory proposes as the way out of this dilemma, the human mind, a point Wiener stresses throughout his work. Through the intermediary of past experience a priori knowledge is available about the message and its symbols. This knowledge generates feedback, something that both reduces the uncertainty of the message and allows new and unexpected interpretations to take place. As did Willard Gibbs, Wiener sees entropy not simply as an outside force acting on man but as one that includes man as an agent who endeavors to interfere with the natural random order of events. Wiener goes on to equate information and value as what he calls "negative entropy," the motive force in the relationship of man to his environment, for in seeking order and knowledge man is continually trying to establish an otherwise improbable congruence between human ideas and natural events. Because of the possibility of what he called "local enclaves of order," Wiener felt that the randomness associated with entropy was a privation, an Augustinean "organic incompleteness" rather than the "positive malicious evil of the Manichaeans": the Augustinean devil, which is not a power in itself, but the measure of our own weakness, may require our full resources to uncover, but when we have uncovered it, we have in a certain sense exorcised it, and it will not alter its policy on a matter already decided with the mere intention of confounding us further.37 In presenting entropy as a "thought fragment" which, when placed in a new context, can be understood as something other than an indication of absolute disorder, Gaddis is asking the reader to go beyond the confines of the deterministic action within the text, to stretch the reader's "ability" to meet his "need" and redeem an implausible order within an otherwise entropic novel. In sum, Gaddis' use of Benjamin in both the form and content of JR first provides the sense that art is bankrupt so long as it stands apart from the socioeconomic realities of the world. Second, Benjamin's theory provides a vision of the reader as a collaborator, one who pieces together the fragments of artistic insight in order to circumvent conventional and distorted wisdom about the very possibility of order. One should not assume that the novel simply replicates a messianic Marxism, however, for Benjamin's "thought fragments" technique ap- 177</page><page sequence="18">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE plies as well to another source of establishing worth buried under the debris of JR's corporate world. Returning again to Jack Gibbs's book as a source for fragments, the careful reader recalls Gibbs's comment to Amy that the book is "-About a lot of things it's can't say what a book's about before it's done that's what any book worth reading's about, prob- lem solving" (p. 499). To solve the "problem" of establishing coherent meaning within JR, the reader must examine another "thing" discussed in Gibbs's book, the concept "as another mother country throwback had it, [that] all art does constantly aspire to the condition of music" (p. 289). This reference to Walter Pater's concept of the position of music as the highest art form, together with the opening sentence of Gibbs's book, "Music is free to all" (p. 203), suggest that the reader take Gibbs's ideas about random patterns and relate them to the musical references inJR. In so doing, one finds that it is not true, as one critic put it, that "there is no music in JR"; the problem is to discern its tonic and overtones amidst the cacophony the novel presents.38 The problem is solved if one returns to the Wagnerian fundamental tonic of E-flat, considering it not in its transfigured monetary form that opens the novel, but in its original state which can effect a kind of Keatsian "negative capability" in an audience. As Bast tells Amy, "No not asking them making them, like that E-flat chord that opens The Rhinegold goes on and on for a hundred and thirty-six bars until the idea that everything's happening under water is more real than sitting in a hot plush seat with tight shoes on" (p. 111). The means by which one understands the potential transforma- tional power of music as represented by the E-flat tonic is the confusion between Wagner and Mozart in JR. As a result of the confusion of instructional tapes at JR's school, the reader hears characters mentioning "Mozart's Ring" ("Mozart's Rhinegold" [p. 29]; "Mozart's, ah, Ring, is it?" [p. 39]). At first, this confusion seems only to confirm the chaotic and worthless instruction taking place at the school. Investigated more carefully, however, this confusion between the two composers reveals an important linkage concerning how to recover meaning within a chaotic landscape, the concept of agape. In Mozart, His Character His Work, Alfred Einstein notes that Mozart's last opera, The Magic Flute, was written in the same E-flat key Wagner used in the Ring.39 By itself, this fact is not extraordinary, since on the surface there seems to be little similarity between Mozart's innocuous libretto about the fortunes of Tamino and Wagner's cosmic myths. However, Einstein goes on to say that E-flat is the Masonic key and that The Magic Flute was designed by Mozart as a tribute to the 178</page><page sequence="19">READING WILLIAM GADDIS'JR ethical tenets of Free Masonry, specifically the concern with the alleviation of man's fear of death by teaching him the selfless, cosmic principle of agape.40 To overcome the fear of personal extinction that underlies the fear of death, the Masons taught that man should neither deny death nor try to escape its consequences. Instead, one must embark upon a chthonic journey to hell itself, shedding personal concern in order to reach the intellectual illumination that death is nothing to fear because individual identity is not important. This recognition leads one to the condition of agape, a selfless acceptance of the worthlessness of individuality which paradoxically frees one for the experience of living life, not by amassing wealth or holding power, but by giving, by caring for others more than for oneself. One can now understand the concept of "Mozart's Ring" in a new way, as an oblique allusion to the concept of agape. Already conspicuous by its repeated mention in such an otherwise loveless book, agape can now be understood as Gaddis' specific alternative to the greed and inaction present within the novel. With a backward glance at the "Holy Shit" of money, the reader is better able to understand Gaddis' frequent reference to a letter written by Mozart in which he says that "believing and shitting are two very different things" (p. 42). Mozart recognized the necessity of the "shit" of money, as Gaddis reminds us through numerous references to the composer's money problems (pp. 40-42). However, as the letter of Mozart reminds us, belief is a different state, a way of achieving the higher truth dramatized by Mozart's music, so long as one clearly separates belief from greed and the worship of money. Gaddis does not confine this oblique allusion to Mozart and his work. Within the novel, the reader now has a better understanding of why Gaddis made James, Bast's uncle and a "genius" composer according to the otherwise cynical Gibbs (p. 117), a member of the Masonic order (pp. 11, 62). Genius, music, and agape are equated throughout JR. If one explores carefully, one finds that Wagner, the composer mentioned most often in JR, shifted his spiritual allegiance from Feuerbachian Eros to Schopenhauerian agape, a belief quite similar to Mozart's: namely, that one reaches illumination through a journey wherein one confronts and lets go of his individuality on the way to a higher state of consciousness.41 Beethoven, an ardent admirer of The Magic Flute, likewise practiced the fundamental tenet of Free Masonry, a belief that informs Gibbs's use of a quotation from the deaf composer that "the better of us keep one another in mind" (p. 290).42 Even Gibbs's "gloomy" philosopher Empedocles posited agape as the 179</page><page sequence="20">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE principle that musically transforms the strife, the Benjamin-like fragments of the world, into order.43 What the oblique allusions to agape share is a cosmic vision. Suffering, randomness, and chaos are the unavoidable conditions of life that can neither be controlled by money nor refined out of existence by art. However, by living according to the selfless principle of agape, one can transform this chaos. The world is entropic, but in the way Willard Gibbs rather than Jack Gibbs suggested: a random system in which order is improbable but not impossible. Faced with the shut door, the tiirschluss syndrome, the reader now has the key to open it. Armed with this knowledge the reader can now better understand Jack Gibbs's comment that his fellow failed artist Thomas Eigen ("self" in German) had "run out of agape." As Rhoda reminds Bast, Schramm's suicide was not a result of despair. Like the other artists inJR, Schramm could not use his aesthetic gift as a means of redemption because he could not get away from his ego: "none of you trust anybody you're all scared shitless of it [passion and intimacy] aren't you, I mean he's so hung up on this book he's scared to lose this lousy opinion of himself that's why none of you can . . ." (p. 606). Gibbs interrupts at this point, but Gaddis' point is made nevertheless. By focusing on the self, Schramm and the other artists in JR ironically perpetuate the very tendency of contemporary society to "eliminate failure as the precondition for success" that Gibbs finds so abhorrent. As long as artists remain concerned with avoiding the "failure" of self-destruction, none of them can reach the state of agape, the only state by which the chaos of society can be successfully transformed. The allusions to agape in JR provide another means for the reader to become a collaborator, assembling the fragments that refer to agape to transform the apparent narrative chaos of JR into meaning. The ethical tenet that emerges from JR is, as Edward reminds the reader, in the doing: "I mean until a performer hears what I hear and can make other people hear what he hears it's just trash" (p. 724). The crux, of course, is to play this music in the no-deposit-no-return world of JR, where the possibility of failure to do anything is great. To insure that any recovery of meaning is contingent upon action the reader takes, JR does not totally separate "good" music and "bad" money. The recurring image of the pianola, the "refurbished" larynx of the dead singer (p. 288), together with the graphic equation made between the JR corporate logo, the dollar sign, and the musical clef (p. 536), suggest that money and music can be connected in the corporate world's attempt to "get the God damned artist out of the arts once and 180</page><page sequence="21">READING WILLIAM GADDIS'JR for all" (p. 288). The pathology of greed, the "shit," as Gaddis reminds us, can be left in the piano (p. 142). What does separate the two subjects, what keeps agape from becoming agape, is man acting, striving to transform fragments into meaning. William Gaddis, JR (New York: Knopf, 1976).
