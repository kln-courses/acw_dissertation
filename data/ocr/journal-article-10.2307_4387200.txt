<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Greek Philosophy. Part I, Thales to Plato. By John Burnet. London: Macmillan Company (1914). Pages x + 360. $2.50. This excellent work is divided into three books. Of these, the first, in six chapters, deals with the world, the second, in five chapters, with knowledge and con- duct, the third, in six chapters, with Plato. To these is added, in an Appendix, a table of Plato's family, adapted from Kirchner's Prosopographia to the con- clusions reached by the author in the present work, English and Greek Indices conclude the volume. In the Preface the author states that the volume was interrupted in its preparation and belated by his work on the Lexicon Platonicum; that he has been obliged "to deal with certain parts of the subject in a form which does not admit of detailed argument and still less of controversy"; that for the first book greater detail is made unnecessary by the second edition of his Early Greek Philosophy, but that certain parts of the third book embody baldly-stated conclusions which the author hopes to discuss in later works. He declares that his chief aim for the present "has been to assist students who wish to acquire a first-hand knowledge of what Plato actually says in the dialogues of his ma- turity".</page><page sequence="2">92 THE CLASSICALtWEEKLY The author has "not thought it well to present Greek names in a Latin dress". But the practice of writing "Theaitetos" as the name of the philosopher in Athens and "Theaetetils" as the name of the dialogue does not satisfy our taste for uniformity. The possible failure to identify Herakleitos when his name is written Heraclitus seems trivial as a reason for using the former spelling. It is worth while to note the author's idea of the nature of philosophical research and writing. In his mind the history of philosophy as such is impossible. Yet there are certain external matters, such as the times and the contemporaries of a philosopher, which are knowable and important. There are also the under- lying data of Greek science and mathematics, which are reasonably determinable and essential. And there is the purgative function of history. Misconceptions, warped and biased judgments, unfounded dogma and prejudice must be cleared away. Philosophy is not mythology; nor is it positive science. It is related to both. Philosophy begins with the Greeks because rational science begins with the Greeks. Egyptian science and Babylonian science were not really rational science, as is shown by the fact that Greek science in some aspects remained at a very primitive stage for two or three generations after the contribution which Egypt and Babylon had to make in this line came to Hellas. Babylonian astronomy doubtless attained its highest development under Greek influence. The sober, critical, discriminating judgment of the Greeks in distinguishing scientific observations and erroneous inferences is rightly recognized. Philosophy, therefore, undertakes to answer the question What is real? In this appears also the advancement of positive science. But the problem of reality involves man's relation to that reality and this goes beyond the realm of pure science. There is here an act of faith, a belief, even among the Greek philosophers, that reality is divine, and that the human soul must make contact with it. In fact the religious instinct prompted investigation. To know reality, and to communicate that knowledge was the burning zeal of these early Greeks. Following the customary path of the historian of philosophy the author deals with the search of the early Ionians for ultimate matter, and gives a brief analysis of the contribution to the solution of the problem made by Thales, Anaximander, and Anaxime- nes. Considerable agitation has arisen over the use of the term #0TSs as applied to the material substrate of things. In the present volume the author claims (page 27), that the word was used by.the Greeks in the sense of original matter; he cites Plato, Laws 89I C, and Aristotle, Met. 4.4, I014b i6, in proof that 06o,at was not understood to mean primarily 'growth', but 'substance', and ends by saying that to his mind "the fact that the atomists called the atoms Oka is con- clusive". This has been called in question by Pro- fessor Heidell, who states that "Professor Bumet . . . in a private communication to the author virtually retracted the statements in question". It is safe to say, therefore, that whether or not 06ouai primarily means 'to grow', 0itto is not claimed to convey to us the idea of elemental substance. The author next reviews the agencies which caused the overthrow of the Ionian civilization, which was thoroughly secular in its character. He finds these agencies in Homer's human hierachy of heaven, and in Hesiod's gods, which were ofily personifications of natural phenomena or of human passions. A commer- cial aristocracy replaced the feudal society of Homer. The reaction against Homeric polytheism set in when men felt a real need of worship. The influence of Delos continued. But times were ripe for the worship of such gods as Demeter and Dionysus, two gods scarcely known to Homer. The Orphic revival was- the response of men's hearts to the changed order of things. Thus the orphic religion appealed to men by a revelation made through sacred books, and was established in organiza- tions not on the basis of blood but of fraternity. Such ideas as that of the immortality of the soul, of heaven and hell, of redemption and purification were demand- ing and receiving recognition. This spirit of enlighten- ment is especially noticeable in Xenophanes. He represents the reaction against the effeminate refine- ment, the pessimism and the frivolity of his age. There was a corresponding change in dress, and also in architecture. Xenophanes led the revolt against Homer's anthropomorphic polytheism. He reduced the gods to meteorological phenomena, mostly clouds. The world is the one, the only god. This is pantheism. But Xenophanes was not a true scientist. His views of the world were antiquated. 'Even if a man should chance to say the complete truth', said he, 'he cannot know that it is the complete truth' (fr. 34). Thus Xenophanes antedates Epicurus. But neither in poly theism or pantheism on the one hand, nor in enlightened scepticism on the other lay the promise of the future. That promise was in the work of Pythagoras, who first attempted to unite science and religion. So little is known with certainty about Pythagoras that it has ever been difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of his theory or his merit. It has been con- ceded generally that the doctrines of the early Pytha- gorean school can safely be ascribed to Pythagoras him- self. The author's statement (37, footnote), that Aris- totle never attributes any doctrine to Pythagoras him- self is not strictly true, although it appears that only one direct reference is made by Aristotle to Pythagoras. This is the statement (Mag.Mor. i.i.6), that Pytha- goras was the first to undertake to deal with virtue, but he did it in a wrong way, since he referred virtues to numbers, and so did not adopt a proper method for the investigation of virtues. That Pythagoras of Samos was likely influenced by the philosophy of Miletus and that the worship of Apollo as instanced in the Cretan rites lay at the foundation of Pythagorean mysticism may be accepted as true.

The number theory which is characteristic of the Pythagoreans has ever had great difficulty of acceptance. Aristotle found it so. To conceive of numbers as both the form and the substance of things seems a thing apart from our world. The fundamental doctrine seems to be that both in the realm of numbers and in the realm of the universe the unity which was first formed became the moving cause by which through limitation (rb iripas) infinity of num- bers on the one hand and infinity of universal substance on the other were brought into finite relations2. The author rightly notices the fact that in aligning man with the universe the early Pythagoreans saw the correspon- dence between the two parts of man's being, body and spirit, and the substance and form of the orderly uni- verse; that they considered the two great arts, medicine and music, the means by which respectively the body and the soul are purged from impurities; that these two arts also are based on numerical relations, and that in this sense health as well as harmony is an attunement. Heraclitus and Parmenides are passed with brief comment. By far the most interesting part of Heracli- tus's doctrine is that of the soul. While the author does not go so far, it is quite plain that the human soul, which in reality is a form of aip, corresponds in its nature to the varying conditions of the air, which near the earth is dense and heavy, while upwards toward the sun it becomes ethereal. With this interpretation the doc- trine of the 'moist soul' and the 'dry soul' is understand- able3. With Professor Burnet's statement that Par- menides wrote later than Heraclitus and in conscious opposition to him many will not agree. The words "for whom it is and is not the same" may, as Professor Shorey points out (American Joumal of Philology, 21. 2I2 ff.), refer to Heracitus, but this does not prove that they must refer to him. Zeller, Pre-Socratic Philosophy 2. I I I, concludes that Parmenides was not acquainted with the doctrine of Heraclitus, or took no account of it in his philosophical system. The Parmenilean doctrine 'Being is' is an answer to the fundamental question 'What is reality?', just as the Heraclitean doctrine 'All is flux' is an answer to that same question. The question is older than either of these philosophers. Professor Bumet has done admirably in his treatment of the pluralists in their effort to solve the dilemma of Parmenides-the problem of becoming. Empe- docles thought it could be done by increasing the num- ber of the elements. It is common to suppose that the four 'roots' of Empedocles's doctrine are motionless, lifeless things until the advent of love and strife into the world. It may be a question, however, whether these latter are not introduced to cause qualitative changes only, while the four elements possess a certain amount of motion and self-directed action by which like comes to like4. This, to-be sure, would result only in quantita- tive change, whereas the entrance of love and strife produces qualitative change. Anaxagoras's solution of the problem led him to posit xp5,.ara, by which he meant, says Mr. Bumet, that the original mass was infinitely divisible, and that the smallest division would still 'contain all things' and would be like the whole. Yet, withal, each particle had not the same equal amount of 'all things' in itself. Thus things are named from the preponderating elements composing them. That this is the "very opposite of the doctrine of ele- ments" does not fully appear when one considers the alleged claim of Anaxagoras that snow is black as well as white, but it is called white because the white so far exceeds the black". Applied to the elements, this would mean that particles of bone, for instance, include all other substances in minute form, but that bone so far predominates that the whole is known as bone. And even so considered, virtually the whole mass, great or small, is bone, since there is not a sufficient amount of other substance to be detected. The distinction is theoretical and academic rather than practical and essential. The author rightly shows that ioos, the moving power of Anaxagoras's system, is not incorporeal in its nature. In the chapter on the Eleatics and Pythagoreans Pro- fessor Burnet well sets forth the theory of limits as pro- pounded by Zeno. All these arguments, as he shows, involve a necessary recourse to infinities either as points in space or in time, in essential connection with finite measurements of space and time. This is fatal in prac- tice. That an oncoming train will never overtake a loiterer on the track in front of it because, in sooth, it must first traverse half the distance to him, then half of the remaining distance, and so on, ad infinitum, theoretically works out with mathematical precision and with beautiful logic, but ends in practical disaster for the one who so reckons. That the later Pytha- goreans modified the original doctrine of numbers 2For some time it has been the reviewer's belief that Parnenides's poem is largely taken up with either a refutation or an acceptance of Pythagoreanism.

I. 2; 404h8) certainly understood Empedocles to call his elements souls (oroT0eLCa). For the objection to this interpretation see Professor Heidel, On Fragments of the Pre-Socratics, Proceedings American Academy, 48. 726. 8This is at best scarcely the thought of Anaxagoras as recorded by Sextus (Pyrrh. I. 33). After stating (31) eVTiT10e6/V 5o J oatw6lAevea oaweOgivotS J voo6,aeva voou/uhO1s J baUeeXXdA , citing an example of each, Anaxagoras continues: Poo06seva 5o q5catvowAivot, (s 6 'AvCaEay6pcLI TCj XeVKhv ebvaL T'V X6va dvreTriOec 6TLi X XL1V lWOp &amp;Trl ve77y6s, Tb &amp; V8cp aTT IAAaP, Kal j XLcb.W dp1&amp; /Xatvd &amp;T. This proof that snow is black because snow is frozen water and water is dark is quite differ- ent from the statement that snow is called white because that color predominates.</page><page sequence="4">94 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY seems certain. Things now become not numbers, but like numbers. Here arose the forms (eW8q), to which, through the influence of Socrates and Plato, men turned their thoughts in the matter of moral and aesthetic considerations. The first part of the historical account of philosophy, according to the writer, ends with Leucippus's doctrine of atoms and void. The author well insists on atom motion, in this early period of atomism, as motion in all directions, and not, as the Epicureans later taught, motion eternally downward. Judging from this, we may say that Leucippus and Democritus had the advan- tage in the matter of consistency over the later atomists. The linking together, however, of atoms and the Pythagorean numbers may not be a happy stroke. It is hardly possible that the numbers suggested to Zeno the atoms. Some remote resemblances, to be sure, are noticeable. The 'vortex' as the resultant of atoms moving in void is, at the time of Leucippus, the most advanced idea in philosophy. With this answer to the question, what is reality, a tide sets in against sc ience, and the current of men's thoughts is turned into the channel of knowledge and conduct. The Sophists stood at the forefront of this movement. Law governing human conduct and nature of which man is a part are in a sense antithetical. The question naturally arises whether this explanation of the universe is better than that, whether man in his sphere is amen- able to this code of laws or to that, whether everything connected with both of them might not have been different than it has been found and reported to be. It was the function of the Sophist to raise these questions. And, as the author points out, Protagoras and Gorgias take a negative attitude not so much toward religion as toward science. The Age of the Sophists is primarily an age of reaction against science. The great contribu- tion of Protagoras to the problem was his proposition that 'man is the measure of all things, of that which is how it is, of that which is not how it is not'. The theory advanced by the author is plausible, that 'measure' in this proposition has its basis in mathe- matics, and that, in things numerical, ratios exist of which man, that is, the accumulated experience of man- kind, is the final measure or test. A theory that works counter to the practical experience of mankind is unsafe and may be disregarded. Such, for instance, was Zeno's theory of limits. But who is man that is the measure of all things? Plato held that one belief may be 'better' than another, apparently meaning by 'better' the beliefs which are most in accord with those of a man in normal conditions of mind and body. Thus the normal man becomes the measure of all things. This is the test of pragmatism. It is possible to make two opposite statements about something, both of which are 'true', but not with the same degree of strength. The author does well here in pointing out that it is the duty of the disputant to make the weaker statement the stronger, and that in itself this is not an immoral doc- trine. The common interpretation of the phrase 'to make the worse appear the better reason' does involve moral delinquencies. It is apparent, however, that dialectic of this sort had driven Gorgias and Protagoras to renounce all science. This is seen in Gorgias's con- clusions: (I) there is nothing; (2) even if there is any- thing, we cannot know it; (3) even if we could know it, we could not communicate our knowledge to anyone else. It is the custom of later years in treating of Socrates to give little weight to Xenophon's account of that philosopher in his Memorabilia. That account is con- sidered biased, untrustworthy, and perhaps largely fictitious. Professor Burnet's opinion is that Xenophon is thoroughly unreliable, that the Platonic Socrates is the only Socrates we may hope to know well, and that, "if he is a fictitious character, he is nevertheless more important than most men of flesh and blood". Aristo- phanes's Clouds presents Socrates in caricature. It is Mr. Burnet's belief that there are two distinct periods in Socrate's life, and that Aristophanes is dealing with the earlier, Xenophon with the later period. This is plausible and well sustained. As a young man, accord- ing to the Clouds, Socrates was interested in natural science, in the things of the heavens and the things beneath the earth. The doctrine of air as the elemen- tal substance posited by Anaximenes, had been revived by Diogenes, and in Plato Socrates is made to say that he had investigated the question whether 'what we think with' was air or blood. Moreover, Aristophanes represents Socrates as suspended in a basket in mid air in order to get pure dry air for his thought. All this accords well with the interests of his earlier years. Socrates was, in a sense, a mystic, strangely influenced by Orphicism and Pythagoreanism, yet withal main- taining a balance of mind and poise of judgment that kept him from the fantastic features of either of these influences. Just because of this reserve, he would naturally turn to the science of his day for satisfaction. But the nature theories presented by that science all proved disappointing. Zeno, and the art of dialectic, made a strong appeal to him. In the midst of all this he discovered that he had a mission. The oracle had revealed it. He was the instrument chosen by God to convince men of their ignorance. This oracle was not taken too seriously by Socrates, but with sufficient seriousness to give him added influence over men who knew him. Our author has drawn a clear picture of this unique character-his physical features, and his mental and spiritual endowments. His was a srlub nose, his eyes protruding, his gait awkward; he wore no sandals; he resembled a Silenus or a Satyr; he claimed to have a daemon which kept him out of peril and poli- tics; he dreamed dreams; he had a rich vein of humor. His philosophy is said to be characterized by "intelligi- ble forms"; only objects of thought have real being, objects of sense are becoming; our criterion of objective reality arises from our experience of sensible things, yet apprehension of the standard cannot be produced by the</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 95 particular things we sense, since it goes beyond any and all of them. Professor Burnet seems obscure here. It would appear that the "forms" are "class-concepts", at least that they are "concepts" based on human experi- ence and apprehended by the soul, while particulars are known through sense. The recognition of the universal in a particular case may pass under the head of "Remin- iscence", but surely the type, the form, the concept are the standard of recognition and comparison, and this is precisely the teaching of Socrates. In method this theory of knowledge is dialectical. It involves the Socratic examination of self, the search for true enlight- enment, and the formation of concepts as a standard of proof. In the latter instance things of sense are real in so far as they participate in ultimate reality or form. Yet in the application of this theory there arises the difficulty of constructing the form of the 'good' in a method similar to that by which the forms of sense objects are constructed. For, to the Sophists, 'good- ness' was efficiency, particularly in the management of the family and the state. Socrates identified knowledge and goodness, thus making a distinction between philo- sophic goodness and popular goodness. The former alone is real knowledge and alone can be taught. At the close of this discussion of Socrates Professor Burnet posits two statements in explanation of his method: . (i) that it is "worth while to try the experi- ment of taking Plato's dialogues in their natural sense"; and (2) "that the burden of proof does not lie with those who adopt this hypothesis, but with those who deny it". The Socrates of Plato is not a fiction. And withal, Plato is a dramatic artist. A word only may be added concerning the charge on which Socrates was condemned. As the author points out, it flouts the rational sense of men to be told that Socrates was really condemned on the charge of intro- ducing new gods or of corrupting the young men of Athens. The real meaning and purport of the charge was "that Socrates had fostered in young men that anti-democratic spirit which has led to the ologarchical revolutions". Democritus, the disciple of Leucippus, had to face precisely the same problems of knowledge and conduct as Socrates had to face. To these problems the respec- tive solutions offered by Socrates and Democritus laid the foundations for the system of idealism on the one hand and for the system of materialism on the other. For both these philosophers the soul is the instrument of knowledge, but with Socrates the soul is a non-material, immortal entity, with Democritus it is material and mortal. The third book of Professor Burnet's work is devoted to Plato. It includes the real contribution of the author to the understanding and interpretation of that philosopher. The author's theory is that in the earlier, so-called Socratic dialogues, the Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Charmides, Laches, Lysis, Euthydemus, Prota- goras, Gargias, and Meno, and doubtless the Symposium, Phaedo, and in part the Republic, Plato's dramatic power is exercised to the full; "that Plato had as yet nothing that could rightly be called a philosophy of his own"; that certain parts of the Republic and the Phaedrus give the first intimations of independent philosophic thought on the part of Plato. This de- cidedly is a revolutionary view. It has been customary to recognize the so-called Socratic dialogues as works in which Plato was much under the sway of the master's influence, and that in his later years he asserted his own position, and established his own system of belief; that there was a natural and a normal growth in the develop- ment of Plato's logic, beginning with the impulse im- parted from Socrates and ending in Plato's complete mastery of his own system. It is Professor Burnet's opinion that Plato's great theory, the doctrine of ideas, originated with Pythagoras, or the Pythagoreans, that Socrates in his earlier years, interested as he was in matters physical, gave little heed to this metaphysical problem, that in the later period he came to recogniz, the importance of the concept as the standard of reality, that Plato, in the earlier dialogues, is masquerading as Socrates, that later there was a complete break in Plato's thought, and that then he came forth with his own theory of the doctrine of ideas. Two or three questions arise for solution at this point. In the first place, is it likely or even possible that a man of Plato's character should merge his identity for so long a period into that of another man so completely as to lose him- self entirely in so doing? In answer we may say that much in the same way Shakespeare in more recent times is the prince of dramatic artists, that his materials are gathered and borrowed from this source and from that, and yet no one thinks of Shakespeare as anything but a master of literary creation. To be sure, Plato had the personality of one great master before him, but it is difficult to conceive that he so lost himself in that mas- ter as not to maintain his own intellectual identity. It seems quite incredible that Plato should have become Plato at all if there is nothing but Socrates in the earlier dialogues. Again, would it not seem strange that a doctrine, as pronounced as is the doctrine of ideas, should fail to be recognized in Plato's early years, especially in view of the fact that the doctrine is claimed to be Pythagorean, that Socrates was familiar with Pytha- goreanism, and that he made his most substantial con- tribution to philosophy in his theory of the concept, which certainly is akin to the doctrine of ideas? That there is room here for a difference of opinion is seen in the fact that Lutoslawski finds the roots of the doctrine of ideas in Plato's discovery of a priori knowledge in the Meno, the Euthydemus and the Gorgias, and both he and Bumet assign all three of these dialogues to the Socratic, or earliest, period of Plato's writing. The reviewer of Burnet's book in The Nation, (December 3 1, 1914), goes so far as to say that "to maintain that the thought of the earlier dialogues is purely Socratic and in no sense Platonic, to hold that Plato was a mere dramatist when he wrote the Republic . . . seems. . . little short of nonsense". The present reviewer believes</page><page sequence="6">96 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY that the more conservative interpretation is the more correct. Granted that Plato in his earlier period was primarily interested in Socrates, may it not be true that, as Socrates passed through the experiences which characterized the earlier and the later period of his thought and interest, and yet withal in a normal and logical development, so Plato, the faithful and loyal disciple, passed through a somewhat similar develop- ment, first devoting himself to the thorough mastery of the doctrines of his great teacher and then building upon that foundation of knowledge the superstructure of his own thought. We have dwelt at some length on matters controver- sial. Let us look at the constructive features of the book. The absolute candor and fair-mindedness of the author compel the closest scrutiny of his work on the part of the reader. Matters of universal interest and importance are emphasized, non-essentials are sub- ordinated. The widest range of scholarship is every- where in evidence; the mastery of the materials is superb. It is safe to say that there is no other volume covering the same period in which the general reader is so well instructed and the scholar so highly edified. The author's purpose to assist students to a first-hand knowledge of the matters here dealt with has certainly been accomplished. WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COLLEGE. ROBERT B.
