<plain_text><page sequence="1">44 INTENTIONALITY AND INTENSIONALITY Certain philosophers have held the thesis of the unity of science.1 As often conceived, this thesis has two parts: the thesis of physicalism and the thesis of extensionality. For each of these two parts there is an outstanding problem, i.e. the problem of intentionality and the problem of intensionality respectively. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to make explicit the nature of these two problems, and second, to show to what extent they can be said to be the same problem. Thus I am not at all interested here either to defend or attack this thesis or either of its parts. I shall first define the two theses. PHYSICALISM AND THE PROBLEM OF INTENTIONALITY The thesis of physicalism has had several formulations. I shall interpret physicalism to be the thesis that the language of physics is adequate for a complete description of the world. This view, then, is that the language of physics can be made the universal language of science. An obvious problem for this view is that one sub-domain of science, psychology, seems to require terms such as ' believe ', ' assume ', ' desire ', ' hope ', ' think ', and ' doubt ' which are quite unnecessary for physics. The problem of intentionality is the problem of showing that we do not need such " intentional " terms in order fully to describe the world. We can define the problem of intentionality more precisely by stating what I shall call the thesis of intentionality as it is presented by R. M. Chisholm. Let us say (1) that we do not need to use intentional language when we describe nion-psychological, or " physical ", phenomena; we can express all that we know, or believe, about such phenomena in language which is not intentional. And let us say (2) that, when we wish to describe certain psychological phenomena-in particular, when we wish to describe thinking, believing, perceiving, seeing, knowing, wanting, hoping and the like-either (a) we must use language which is intentional or (b) we must use a vocabulary which we do not need to use when we describe non-psychological or " physical " phen- omena.2 If the view that Chisholm has expressed here is correct, then the thesis of physicalism is mistaken. The problem of showing that this view is wrong is the problem of intentionality. We must now explain what is meant by intentional language. According 'Such a view in various forms has been held by men such as Neurath, Carnap, Schlick, and Hempel. For example, see R. Carnap, The Unity of Science, (London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1934). See also the articles by Schlick and Hempel in Section VI of Readings in Philosophical Analysis, (New York: Appleton-Century- Crofts, Inc., 1949), H. Feigl and W. Sellars, editors. 2R. M. Chisholm, " Sentences about Believing ", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 56 (1955-1956), p. 129. This is also discussed in Chisholm's book, Perceiving, (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1957), pp. 168-173.</page><page sequence="2">INTENTIONALITY AND INTENSIONALITY 45 to Chisholm there are three individually sufficient criteria of intentionality. I shall paraphrase them in order to use terminology more appropriate than Chisholm's for comparing intentionality and intensionality. The three criteria are as follows: 1. A simple declarative sentence is intentional if it uses a substantive expression (a name or description) as the direct object of an action verb and in such a way that neither the sentence nor its contra- dictory implies whether or not the expression has a non-null extension, i.e. whether or not the expression truly applies to anything.3 2. A complex declarative sentence (a sentence containing a subordin- ate clause or an equivalent phrase) is intentional if neither the sentence nor its contradictory implies anything about the truth- value of the subordinate clause. 3. A declarative sentence is intentional if it contains a substantive expression which is such that its replacement in the sentence by an expression with the same extension, i.e. by an extensionally equivalent expression, results in a sentence, the truth-value of which will under certain conditions differ from that of the original sentence.4 Chisholm says two additional things. First, he says that a compound sentence is intentional " if and only if one or more of the component sen- tences of its indicative version is intentional ".5 Second, he suggests that by adopting Frege's terminology we can make the third criterion " do the work of the first two ".6 Since I have paraphrased Chisholm's criteria using a terminology similar to Frege's, this will enable us to examine Chis- holm's suggestion during our discussion of the relationship between inten- tionality and intensionality. At this point let me give three examples each of which proves to be intentional by at least one of the three criteria. First, the sentence " John is thinking of Pegasus " is intentional by the first criterion because neither the sentence nor its contradictory implies anything about the extension of the substantive expression 'Pegasus'. That is, neither the sentence nor its contradictory implies whether or not 'Pegasus' truly applies to any- thing. Second, the sentence " John believes that Pegasus once lived " is intentional by the second criterion because neither this complex sentence nor its contradictory implies anything about the truth-values of 'Pegasus once lived'. Third, the sentence " John knows that Pegasus is a fictitious creature " is intentional by the third criterion because if we replace the substantive expression ' Pegasus ' by the extensionally equivalent expression 3I have not only paraphrased this criterion but also added to it the phrase " as the direct object of an action verb " which makes explicit what seems to be the point of such criteria, that is, that these are criteria of intentional activity. Thus, we are interested only in verbs expressing this kind of activity, and consequently only in those substantive expressions which occur as direct (grammatical) objects of these " intentional " verbs. 4For the way Chisholm expresses these three criteria, see " Sentences about Be- lieving ", pp. 126-128. 5Ibid., p. 129. 6lbid., p. 128.</page><page sequence="3">46 JAMES W. CORNMAN 'the winged horse captured by Bellerophon ', the truth-value of the resulting sentence would differ from the original if, for example, John knew that Pegasus is a creature from Greek mythology but had never heard of Bellerophon. EXTENSIONALITY AND THE PROBLEM OF INTENSIONALITY Let us now turn to the thesis of extensionality. This thesis states that a universal language of science may be extensional, or, as Carnap says, "for every given [non-extensional] language S1 an extensional language S2 may be constructed such that S1 may be translated into S2".7 By an extensional language I mean a language such that each of its sentences is extensional. And I understand an extensional sentence to be a sentence the extension of which is a function of the extensions of its designative components.8 Let me amplify this. First, let us take as the extension of a declarative sentence its truth-value. Thus the truth-value of a sentence is a function of the extensions of its components. Second, because the truth-value of such a sentence is a function of only the extensions of its components, then if a sentence is extensional, the replacement of one of those components by another expression with the same extension, i.e. by an extensionally equivalent expression, will not change the truth-value of the sentence. Third, if certain of the components are sentential elements, i.e. clauses, then the truth-value of the sentence is a function of the truth- values, i.e. extensions, of the simple sentential elements which are its com- ponents. With this characterization of extensionality in mind, let me now state two jointly sufficient necessary conditions of the extensionality of a sentence. A sentence is extensional if and oily if: 1. The truth-value of a sentence which results from the replacement of any expression contained in the original sentence by an exten- sionally equivalent expression will not differ from that of the original under any conditions. 2. The truth-value of the sentence, if it is compound or complex, i.e. if it contains co-ordinate main clauses or at least one subordinate clause, is a function of the truth-values of the simple sentential elements which make up the compound or complex sentence. I shall say that any sentence which fails to meet at least one of these con- ditions is a non-extensional or an intensional sentence. The problem of intensionality, then, arises because contrary to the thesis of extensionality, it does not seem that all intensional sentences utilized by science can be translated into extensional sentences. As an example let us examine the sentence " John believes that all humans are mortal ". This sentence is not 7R. Carnap, The Logical Syntax of Language, (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1937), p. 320. 8By a designative component of a sentence I mean a component which has independ- ent meaning at least to some degree. Such components are to be distinguished from syncategorematic components. (See R. Carnap, Meaning and Necessity, (Chicago: The Univ. of Chicago Press, 1958), pp. 6-7 for this distinction.) Consequently a designative component of a sentence has an extension which, however, may be null. Hereafter in this paper when I speak of components of sentences I shall be referring to designative components.</page><page sequence="4">INTENTIONALITY AND INTENSIONALITY 47 extensional because it fails to meet the first condition of extensionality. Suppose that the sentence is true and that John has a false anthropomorphic view of God. If this belief-sentence were extensional, then by replacing ' humans ' with the extensionally equivalent expression ' featherless bipeds ' the truth-value would not change. But under the above stated conditions it would be changed because John believes that there is a featherless biped who is immortal, i.e. God. Thus the new sentence is false and the original sentence intensional. Another kind of intensional sentence is the kind which fails to meet the second condition. Contrary-to-fact or subjunctive conditionals are an important part of this class of sentences because of their relationship to scientific laws. For example, the sentence " If Socrates had pleaded guilty, he would not have had to drink hemlock " is a contrary-to-fact conditional, because it implies that its antecedent clause taken as a declarative sentence is false. If this conditional were extensional, and thus truth-functional, its truth-value would be a function of the truth-values of its antecedent and its consequent clauses. Thus, knowing the truth-value of these two clauses when taken as declarative sentences would be sufficient for calculating the truth-value of the conditional. However, for contrary-to-fact conditionals this is not sufficient. The two clauses are both false and, it seems, the con- ditional is true. Thus if the truth-value of this kind of conditional is a function of the truth-value of its two clauses, then all such conditionals should be true. But this is not the case. For example, the false conditional, " If Socrates had pleaded guilty, he would have been crowned queen of Sparta " has both clauses false. Thus such sentences are not truth-functional. Their truth-value seems to depend not merely on the truth-value of their component clauses, but also upon the " connection " among the expressions in the clauses. Contrary-to-fact conditionals, then, fail to meet the second condition of extensionality. They are intensional sentences. INTENTIONALITY AND INTENSIONALITY What we have done so far is to characterize the thesis of the unity of science as consisting of two sub-theses, the thesis of physicalism and the thesis of extensionality. That is, the thesis of the unity of science is the claim that all expressions utilized by science can be translated into the physical language which itself can be made extensional. We have also described the two general problems for such a thesis, the problem of inten- tionality and the problem of intensionality. Let us now see to what extent these two problems overlap. To do so, let us examine the relationship of the three independently sufficient conditions of intentionality to the two jointly sufficient necessary conditions of extensionality. I shall begin with the third criterion of intentionality because it is the condition which Chisholm suggests can be made not only sufficient but necessary. The third criterion of intentionality states that a sufficient condition of a sentence being intentional is that the truth-value of the sentence will change under certain conditions, when an expression in the sentence is replaced by an extensionally equivalent expression. Let us compare this</page><page sequence="5">48 JAMES W. CORNMAN with the first necessary condition of extensionality. This condition is that the truth-value of an extensional sentence will not change under any con- ditions when an expression in the sentence is replaced by an extensionally equivalent expression. Since this is a necessary condition of extensionality, then its denial is a sufficient condition for non-extensionality or intension- ality. But this denial is the third criterion of intentionality. Thus any sentence intentional by the third criterion is also intensional because it fails to meet the first necessary condition of extensionality and any sentence which fails to meet this condition of extensionality is intensional. One consequence of this is that given a solution to the problem of intensionality, the problem of intentionality for those sentences intentional on the basis of the third criterion alone is also solved. Another consequence is that if Chisholm's suggestion that the third criterion of intentionality can " do the work of the first two " is correct, then given the problem of intensionality there is no additional problem of intentionality. Intentional sentences would be a subclass, whether a proper subclass or not we shall have to see, of intensional sentences. This con- sequence, then, gives us an additional reason to examine Chisholm's sug- gestion. However, first let us consider the second criterion of intentionality, The second criterion of intentionality states that a sufficient condition of a sentence being intentional is that neither the sentence nor its contra- dictory implies anything about the truth-value of a subordinate clause which is a component of the sentence. In other words, a sufficient condition of intentionality is that the truth-value of the sentence is completely in- dependent of the truth-value of any subordinate clause in the sentence. This amounts to saying that a sufficient condition of intentionality is that the truth-value of the sentence is not a function of the truth-value of any subordinate clause in the sentence. If we look at the second necessary condition of extensionality and confine our attention to complex sentences, we can see that a necessary condition for the extensionality of a complex sentence is that the truth-value of the complex sentence is a function of the truth-values of the simple sentential elements of which it is composed. Thus, because a subordinate clause is a sentential element (either compound, complex, or simple), then a necessary condition of the extensionality of a complex sentence is that the truth-value of the sentence is a function of the truth-values of the subordinate clauses in it, which, if they are not simple themselves, are truth-functional with regard to the simple clauses of which they are composed. The denial of this necessary condition of extensionality is a sufficient condition of intensionality. But this denial is that the truth-value of a complex sentence is not a function of the truth-value of the subordinate clauses in the sentence, which is the second sufficient condition of intention- ality. Thus, as with the third criterion, any sentence intentional by the second criterion is also intensional because it fails to meet the second necessary condition of extensionality. Furthermore, any complex sentence which fails to meet the second necessary condition of extensionality is intentional. A consequence of this is that given a solution to the problem</page><page sequence="6">INTENTIONALITY AND INTENSIONALITY 49 of intensionality the problem of intentionality for those sentences intentional on the basis of the second criterion alone is also solved. We have so far found out that two of the three criteria of intentionality are also criteria of intensionality. Thus all sentences intentional by either the second or third criterion are also intensional. There are two questions left. First, are all sentences intentional by the first criterion also intensional ? If they are, then we can conclude that all intentional sentences are intensional, and then proceed to examine Chisholm's suggestion which amounts to saying that the reason they are all intensional is that they fail to meet the first necessary condition of extensionality. Second, are all intensional sentences intentional ? We have found that all simple and complex intensional sentences are. This leaves only compound sentences to be examined. One way to approach the first question is to find out whether any sentences intentional by the first criterion are extensional. Unlike the second and third criteria there seems to be no necessary condition of exten- sionality comparable to this criterion. The first criterion concerns a certain kind of simple sentence which is not explicitly covered by either necessary condition of extensionality. It seems, then, that there should be an exten- sional sentence which is intentional by the first criterion. This is indeed the case. One example is the sentence " John is thinking of Alaska ". This sentence is intentional by the first criterion because neither the sentence nor its contradictory implies whether or not the substantive expression 'Alaska ' applies to anything, i.e. whether or not ' Alaska ' has an extension. However, the sentence is extensional because it is a simple sentence in which an expression may be replaced by an extensionally equivalent one under any conditions without change of truth-value. The only expression in the sentence which might seem to violate this condition is 'Alaska'. But when we say that John is thinking of Alaska we are claiming that he is thinking of a particular place and what name or description we use to express this claim is limited only by the condition that it indeed apply to the place. This is true of all expressions extensionally equivalent to ' Alaska '. Thus the sentence " John is thinking of Alaska " is true given and only given those conditions under which " John is thinking of the largest state of the United States " is true. In other words, substituting 'the largest state of the United States ' for its extensionally equivalent ' Alaska ' will not change the truth-value of the sentence under any conditions. The sen- tence will have the same truth-value as the original, for example, no matter what John is thinking about Alaska or what he thinks that the largest state is. We have, therefore, found an example of an intentional sentence which is extensional. The class of intentional sentences and the class of intensional sentences are not co-extensive. This shows, incidentally, that Chisholm's suggestion about the applicability of the third criterion of intentionality is mistaken. If it were correct, then, as we have shown, all intentional sen- tences would be intensional. But we have just found an intentional sentence which is not intensional. Thus at least the first criterion of intentionality is not replaceable by the third.</page><page sequence="7">50 JAMES W. CORNMAN Not all intentional sentences are intensional. Are all intensional sentences intentional ? We have found all simple and complex intensional sentences to be intentional. However, certain intensional compound sentences do not seem to be intentional. Certain contrary-to-fact conditionals such as the example used previously are, as we have shown, intensional, but they are not all intentional. Thus the sentence "If Socrates had pleaded guilty, he would not have had to drink hemlock" is intensional because it violates the second necessary condition of extensionality. However, it is not in- tentional because it meets none of the three criteria of intentionality. It does not meet the third criterion because the two substantive expressions in the sentence, ' Socrates ' and ' hemlock ', can be replaced by extensionally equivalent expressions without change of truth-value. The second criterion does not apply because the sentence is not complex. It also fails to meet the first criterion. The only substantive expression which is the direct object of an action verb is 'hemlock'. Although this sentence does not imply whether or not 'hemlock' has a non-null extension, its contradictory, i.e. "He had to drink hemlock ", implies that 'hemlock' does have an extension, i.e. does apply to something. We could, however, make the sentence intentional by changing the second criterion of intentionality so that it applies not only to subordinate clauses and thus complex sentences, but also to co-ordinate clauses and thus compound sentences. By so doing the second and third criteria of intention- ality would be the contradictories of the second and first necessary con- ditions of extensionality. Thus, all intensional sentences would be inten- tional. However, there is another way to interpret the relationship among the various criteria and conditions which seems more appropriate. Intention- ality, as Chisholm points out, has to do with certain activities which can take as objects things which do not exist. Thus to say that someone is performing such an activity with regard to some object, e.g. thinking of it, dreaming of it, looking for it, or hoping for it, is to imply nothing about the existence or non-existence of the object and, therefore, to imply nothing about the extension of the name or description of the object. Thus a cri- terion of intentionality should be one by which we can distinguish intentional from non-intentional activities, or, if it is a criterion relevent to language as those of Chisholm are, one by which we can distinguish verbs which express intentional activities and those which do not. It would seem, furthermore, that it should be a criterion which in some way considers the fact that intentional activities can take as objects things which do not exist. This suggests two reasons why we might more profitably construe the first of Chisholm's three criteria as the one criterion of intentionality, and the other two as merely the contradictories of the two necessary conditions of extensionality, i.e. as the two sufficient conditions of intensionality. First, only the first criterion is concerned with the extensions of substantive expressions which are the direct objects of verbs expressing activities. Thus only the first criterion is directly concerned with matters related to " inten- tional inexistence ". Second, the action verbs which are found to be in- tentional by the other two criteria, are, I believe, with the exception of</page><page sequence="8">INTENTIONALITY AND TNTENSIONALITY 51 one class of verbs also found intentional by the first criterion. Thus although the first criterion may not be sufficient to distinguish all intentional sentences, it seems to be sufficient to distinguish all intentional verbs, with the one possible exception. We must consider this apparent exception now. There is a class of sentences which Chisholm calls " cognitive sentences ", i.e. sentences using verbs such as 'know', 'perceive', and 'remember'. If we use just the first criterion, or even the second, such sentences and thereby such verbs will be excluded from the class of intentional expressions because they are intentional by the third criterion only. Let us take ' know ' as an example. A simple sentence using 'know', such as " John knows the governor of Alaska ", is not intentional by the first criterion because the sentence implies that the substantive expression 'the governor of Alaska ' has an extension. Similarly a complex sentence such as " John knows that Alaska is the largest state " is not intentional by the second criterion because the sentence implies that the declarative sentence " Alaska is the largest state " is true. Thus if we merely use the first, or the first and second criteria, the verb 'know' would not be intentional. However, by the third criterion the sentence " John knows that Alaska is the largest state " is intentional and thereby so is ' know '. If we replace the substantive expression ' the largest state ' by an extensionally equivalent expression, e.g. 'the forty- ninth state', then if John believes that Alaska is the fiftieth state the re- sulting sentence would be false although the original might well be true. I have suggested that the first of Chisholm's criteria seems to be the appropriate criterion of intentionality. But, as we have just seen, cognitive sentences are not intentional by the criterion. This leads to the question of whether we should consider them intentional. There is, I believe, only one argument which would give us reason to think that we should. It goes as follows. All psychological or mental activities have the characteristic of intentionality. Cognitive verbs such as ' know ', ' perceive ', and ' remem- ber' express mental activities. Therefore, such verbs are intentional. This argument can be attacked via either premiss, depending upon the interpreta- tion given to cognitive verbs. If we assume that such verbs express mental activities, then the first premiss, i.e. all mental activities are intentional, seems to be false by the following argument. Intentional activities are those which can take as objects things which may never exist. Knowing, perceiving and remembering take as objects things which must exist at least at some time or other. Therefore, knowing, perceiving and remembering, and thus 'know', ' perceive ', and ' remember ', are not intentional. The above argument is directed against the first premiss only if cognitive verbs express mental activities, i.e. if the second premiss is true. However, as certain philosophers have pointed out, there is good reason to believe that no matter what the truth-value of the first premiss, the second premiss is false. Cognitive verbs are not verbs which designate certain mental activities. In other words, there is no activity corresponding to ' know', for example, in the way the activity of desiring corresponds to the verb ' desire '. There is no unique activity (e.g. some certain infallible mental act which we</page><page sequence="9">52 JAMES W. CORNMAN can perform), such that its occurrence guarantees that we know and do not merely believe something.9 Cognitive verbs are more like what Gilbert Ryle has called " achievement verbs "10 because they express not that some activity has taken place but that over and above the occurrence of any activity some task, i.e. the achievement of knowledge, has been successfully completed. To know, to perceive, or to remember something are, as Ryle points out, analogous to winning rather than running a race. Winning a race, although it implies an activity such as running, is not itself an activity. It is an achievement. Furthermore, just as there is an activity essential to winning, there may be one essential to knowing (certainly believing seems to be necessary). However, just as 'win' does not express running or any other activity, neither does 'know' express any activity essential to it (e.g. 'believe' rather than 'know' expresses believing). Thus although cognitive verbs may imply and thus refer to certain mental activities, they do not express mental or any other kind of activity. They express achieve- ments and achievements are not activities. Thus the second premiss in the above argument is false. In the preceding discussion I have tried to show why cognitive verbs do not seem to be intentional and thus why there is no need for the third of Chisholm's criteria. There is, however, a reason not only against the need of using this criterion, but against considering it at all related to intention- ality. This reason is, incidentally, an additional reason against considering cognitive verbs intentional, because they are intentional only by the third criterion. If the third criterion is properly a criterion of sentences expressing intenitional activity, whether that kind of activity be mental or not, then certain modal sentences such as " It is necessary that Alaska is Alaska ", which do not seem to express any activity, either mental or otherwise, would be intentional and thus express intentional activity.11 For this reason as well as those above, I believe that the third of Chisholm's criteria should be interpreted merely as a criterion of intensionality, as should the second. Thus only the first criterion would be the criterion of intentionality. This interpretation, while maintaining the two problems distinct, as we have seen they are, not only allows us to reduce the number of criteria we must work with, but also, as I hope to have shown, pinpoints which of the criteria are relevant to the problem of intensionality and which to the problem of intentionality. JAMES W. CORNMAN The Ohio State University. 9See J. L. Austin, " Other Minds ", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplemen- tary Volume XX, (1946) for a discussion of this point. '0See G. Ryle, The Concept of Mind, (London: Hutchinson, 1949), pp. 149-153. "It might be suggested that this objection could be avoided by adding to the third criterion a clause similar to the phrase which I added to the first criterion, e.g. " which is the direct object of an action verb ". This would eliminate modal sentences from the class of intentional sentences. It would also, however, if the previous objections are sound, eliminate cognitive sentences because they would not contain action verbs. In such a case, I believe, the third criterion would become unnecessary because it would apply only to those action verbs found intentional by the first criterion,</page></plain_text>
