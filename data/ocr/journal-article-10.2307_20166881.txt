BERGH In extent and explicitness, Moche sexual ceramics are unique in the ancient Americas, where sexual representations are rare.1 The Moche images, many of which are very finely crafted, fall into a relatively small number of standardized types. Included are animal pairs as well as humans who are shown singly, in couples, or in multiple figure scenes. Skeletal human figures are common in several categories, and a fanged, supernatural-like male sometimes appears as the partner of a human female. A rather wide range of sexual activities is depicted?fellatio, sodomy, and vaginal coitus, along with several touching activities sometimes classified now as "foreplay"?but postures and positions are confined to several formulaic types, and a few activities are practiced primarily by certain kinds of figures. For instance, "foreplay" often is shown between a skeletal male and a living female. The meaning of these images, which were created on the north coast of Peru in the first 750 years of our era, has never been researched in detail. Nevertheless, many investigators agree that the sexual representations seem to relate to religious concerns (for instance, Benson 1972: 148-151; Donnan 1978: 177; Hocquenghem 1977c: passim; Kauffmann-Doig 1979: passim; Larco Hoyle 1965: 93-106). The most unequivocal indications of this are the presence of supernatural and skeletal figures in some scenes, and the fact that virtually all of the sexual ceramics, like most other small-scale Moche art, have been recovered from graves, where they were deposited during funerary ceremonies.2 The Moche left no written documents, but colonial reports from the north coast may support this link with ritual. Although written several centuries after Moche civilization disappeared, and thus to be applied cautiously to earlier material, Spanish chronicles do record the practice of ritual sexuality among Ecuadorian and north Peruvian cultures during the conquest period.

This paper is based on a master's essay submitted to the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University in New York. Dr. Esther Pasztory's suggestions helped to shape the original essay, which Elizabeth Benson generously read and commented on. Several friends and colleagues carefully reviewed a preliminary draft of the present paper and shared their insights with me, and Dr. Francesco Pellizzi gave me the benefit of his knowledge and editorial skill in the final stages of manuscript preparation. I extend my appreciation to all of these people. Of course, responsibility for error is mine alone. During research for this project, Dr. Christopher Donnan gave me free access to the Moche archive at the University of California at Los Angeles, and I thank him for sharing this valuable resource with me. The library staff of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research of the University of Indiana was unfailingly helpful in providing access to the institute's photo collection of Moche objects. Finally, I deeply appreciate the support of the Swann Foundation for Cartoon and Caricature, which sponsored research in Peru and an extraordinary first trip to Moche territory on the north coast. 2. In most instances, specific burial contexts are unknown because much of the Moche material has been looted rather than scientifically recovered. However, Larco Hoyle (1946: 175; 1965: 44, 122) comments that they have been found in infant as well as adult graves and that no more than two vessels with sexual representations are placed in a single burial. In addition, Gebhard (1970: 118) notes that sexual ceramics have been recovered from the graves of both males and females.</page><page sequence="3">80 RES 24 AUTUMN 1993 Figure 3.

For instance, Cieza de Le?n (1959: 314) writes that sodomy was engaged in during religious feasts and holidays by "chiefs" and male temple attendants dressed in female attire. Perhaps the most obvious ritual association that can be suggested for the sexual ?mages is with fertility rites, although the specific foundations for such an interpretation have not yet been formulated, and representations of nonreproductive sex, which are common, constitute a problem.3 The following discussion involves two related types of phallic-spouted vessels in which the phallus is either disembodied (figs. 1, 2, 7) or part of a more complex effigy figure (figs. 3, Figure 4. Ceramic effigy vessel of a seated male with a phallic spout. The sides of the upper aperture are again pierced with holes. Photo by Dellenback. Courtesy of The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. 4). Attention focuses exclusively on the phallic spout, since the identity of the effigy figures is not known, and studies of Moche costume and ornamentation are yet insufficient to provide clues for their identification (figs. 3, 4). Landscape/body metaphors A possibly revealing association of the phallic spout is suggested by a few jars representing mountains in which a penis appears as the central peak (fig. 5). These objects belong to a larger category of modeled mountain scenes usually showing several, symmetrically massed peaks that create an amphitheaterlike space within which a variety of objects or scenes appear (compare to fig. 6). Mountains are a prominent geographic feature of the Peruvian 3. For suggestions that the vessels relate to fertility see, for instance, Benson 1972: 148; Donnan 1978: 177; Hocquenghem 1977a,b; Kauffmann-Doig 1979: 14; and Larco Hoyle 1965: 90, 117.</page><page sequence="4">Bergh: Death and renewal 81 Figure 5.

The highlands are virtually the sole source of fresh water on the coast?mountain rivers fill during the rainy season and flow down to the coast to form the fertile valleys that allowed ancient desert cultures to flourish. The substitution of phallus for mountain may relate to a recorded Andean tradition of drawing analogies between the human body and the mountain. Such a mountain/body metaphor has been documented by Bastien (1973, 1978) among the modern Quechua and Aymara speakers of Kaata, located on the Peru-Bolivia border.4 The natives of Kaata form a traditional localized kin group, or ayllu, which has a preconquest origin. Ayllu Kaata resides on a mountainside, and its vertical territory encompasses several different, altitudinally determined ecological levels. Communities that are related to each other through kinship as well as economic and ritual ties are located at each of these levels. Following a mountain/body metaphor, the highest territory, suitable for grazing, is considered to be the head of the ayllu; the mountain's central level, where rich agricultural fields for root crops are located, is equated with the heart, belly, and bowels; and the bordering rivers are taken as the ayIlu's arms and legs, the latter of which flank lower fields in which nonroot crops such as corn and wheat are grown (Bastien 1973: 163-169; 1978: 95). Similar analogies also are found today in the Quechua language, in which a large number of simple and compound lexemes are applied both to body parts and to topographic phenomena; for example, nawi means both "eye" and "spring (of water)," uma is defined both as "head" and as "mountain peak," and wasa refers both to "back" and to "the other side of the mountain" (Stark 1969: 8).5 Similar body metaphors appear to have existed at the time of the conquest as well, where they were used to describe topographic features and perhaps political entities. For instance, Davila Brize?o reports, in 1586, that the people of the Huarochiri region thought of the idol of the Pachacama temple as having rivers issuing from its breasts (Relaciones geogr?ficas 1965, vol. I: 163). Also, the late-sixteenth-century chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega (1977: 93) describes the Inca empire as a human body for which Cuzco served as a navel, and the Inca are said to have regarded the mountains as breasts, and the mountain streams as milk (Brundage 1963: 44).6 4. Aymara and Quechua are the two major indigenous languages of the central Andes. 5. Also, Quechua speakers in the modern community of Misminay near Cuzco describe the constellations in terms of body parts (see Urton 1981: 130-132, 149). Albo (1972), Rowe (1967, cited in Bastien 1978: 87; 1968), and Zuidema (1985) also discuss analogies between animal bodies and the land in ancient and modern Peru?including the plan of Inca Cuzco, said to have been laid out in the shape of a feline's body?and Urton (1981 : chap. 9) describes several animal constellations in both Inca and contemporary Quechua astronomic systems. 6. Brundage does not cite his source for this information, and it could not be verified. A mountain/body metaphor also appears in a small group of colonial representations from Bolivia that shows the body of the Virgin merged with a mountain. Gisbert (1980: 17-22) and Mesa and Gisbert (1982, Tomo I: 301) suggest that this iconography relates to the native belief in Pachamama, the earth mother, and that such ?mages, if not expressing a substitution of the Virgin for Pachamama, then function as a symbol of both old and new. My thanks to Diana Fane for calling these ?mages to my attention.</page><page sequence="5">82 RES 24 AUTUMN 1993 Figure 6. Ceramic stirrup-spouted vessel of a mountain scene with five peaks.

A red stream, probably of blood, flows from beneath the hair down the mountain and may be intended as a metaphor for rivers of fresh water. H: 18 cm, VA48095. Photo by Dietrich Graf. Courtesy of the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Berlin. Water, semen, and regeneration One meaning of the Moche phallus/mountain analogy may relate to a modern native equation between semen, the masculine procreative fluid, and foam or rapidly moving, foamy water, especially fertilizing irrigation water that flows from the highlands during the wet season, when snow meltwater and rain fill rivers that churn down into dry coastal valleys (Isbell 1978: 124, 143, 163; Ossio 1978: 379-381; Urton 1981: 202-204). This water generally is thought to be controlled by mountain deities or spirits, whose cults are practiced throughout the central and southern sierra (see also Anders n.d.: 760ff.). Thus, in the modern community Chuschi, near Ayacucho in the central highlands of Peru, the ritual cleansing of irrigation canals during planting, known as Yarqa Aspiy, is viewed specifically as a preconception ritual for Pachamama (Earth Mother), a deity of pre-Columbian origin, as she awaits the final act of union with the masculine force of moving water, apparently conceptualized as the mountain deities' semen. Subsequent to this union, Pachamama is thought to undergo gestation until the crops are harvested (Isbell 1978: 143-144). The equation between water and</page><page sequence="6">Bergh: Death and renewal 83 agricultural fertility, on one side, and semen, on the other, also is recorded in a myth collected in the early 1900s in the central highlands; in this myth, the theft of a god's testicles, described as the organ that enabled him to fertilize the earth, serves to explain a long period of drought and crop failure (Tello and Miranda 1923: 514-517; see also Trimbom 1951). Conquest period sources also record analogies drawn between fertilizing water and fecundating human body products. A few explicit examples already have been mentioned above. Additionally, in his perceptive analysis of the Huarochiri manuscript, Salomon (1991: 14-15, 18, 78 n. 290) points out that a pervasive, although not explicit, principle structuring the text's data is that earth is primarily feminine in its associations, while water often is conceptualized as male: especially moving, turbulent (foamy), downward flowing water that washes over and fertilizes the earth as it descends toward the sea. The action of union between water and earth is imagined, as Salomon phrases it, as "hydraulic sex." It is in these terms that an episode between Pariacaca, a male deity of the heights, and the beautiful young "earth woman" Chuqui Suso should be seen: Pariacaca one day finds Chuqui Suso standing in her fields, weeping because the maize has dried out from lack of water. In exchange for lovemaking, and as a metaphor for it, Pariacaca waters her fields, widening and extending downward the course of the irrigation canal (Urioste 1983: cap. 6, 81-89).7 Other chroniclers record more general links between sex and water, or allude to the mountains as sacred water sources. In the first instance is Cabello Balboa, who, writing in 1586 about a pre-lnca north coast dynasty, records a story in which sex between Fempellec, the last ruler of the dynasty, and a "devil" who had assumed the form of a beautiful woman provokes the onset of rain, although in this case the water is sent in the form of a flood as punishment for transgressions (cited in Donnan 1978: 100). Also, the Inca are reported by Mur?a (1946: 48) in 1590 to have believed that sins, especially sexual sins, were punished by drought and famine. Thus, the presence or absence of water is determined by the moral valence of the sexual act. Finally, Mur?a (1946: cap. 29, fol. 263, cited in Anders n.d.: 770) and Cobo (1990: 33) both imply that Figure 7.

Courtesy of The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. mountains were regarded as sources of water and fertility by commenting that, in times of water shortage, priests climbed to the highest place possible?that is, a mountain?where sacrifices were made. Avila (1918: 83), who was associated with production of the Huarochiri manuscript, directly states that mountains were worshiped because they were water sources (see also Salomon 1991: 15). Within the Moche material itself, the association of phallus with water is indicated by the representation of a particular bird on the chambers of a few phallic spouted vessels (fig. 7). The same bird appears in painted marsh scenes, which show it in a watery environment that also hosts fish and several varieties of plants (fig. 8). The bird may represent a heron, which has a long, S-shaped neck and thrives around rivers and lakes, as well as near quiet sea bays (Thomson 1964: 7. Salomon (1991: 15) identifies additional encounters in the Huarochiri manuscript between male and female embodiments of water and earth, with attendant, implied analogies between water and semen.</page><page sequence="7">84 RES 24 AUTUMN 1993 Figure 8. Drawing of a marsh scene with large waterbirds, perhaps herons, from the chamber of a ceramic vessel. From Gerdt Kutscher, Nordperuanische Keramik (Berlin: Verlag Gebr. Mann, 1954, Lam. 11 A). Photo: Courtesy of the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut, Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin. 365).8 The S of the bird's neck also is echoed in abstract, S-shaped elements that appear in painted marsh scenes (fig. 8), which Benson interprets as symbols of water (1972: 59). Today similar scroll-like forms serve as fertility signs in the highlands (Isbell 1978: 143). A reference to the connection between male sexuality and plant growth implied by water symbolism also may be found in a Moche relief scene belonging to a category of images that portrays a male, deity I ike figure copulating with an apparently human female (Kinsey Institute photo no. 543; compare to Donnan 1978: fig. 9). In the scene, a plant grows from the area of the couple's joined genitals. The plant may represent a cacao, or chocolate tree, the leaves of which, during the first flush of growth, are pinkish in color and hang limply from their branches, stiffening and turning green as the growth matures (Randall 1986: 92; Steffig 1987: 30).9 The appearance of an analogous physiology may have made the penis an appropriate symbol of seasonal change, the alternation between dry and growing seasons, in the agricultural cycle and, by extension, the parallel cycle of life and death in the human realm. The specific analogy between semen and rushing, foamy mountain water may be based not only on the fact that both are fertilizing fluids but on their shared whitish color.10 Regarding color, it is interesting that chicha, a mildly alcoholic corn beer, is strongly associated with funerary and other rituals in the Andes, both in ancient and modern times, and that one type of chicha made today on the north coast is also milky white. Phallic-spouted vessels may have functioned as containers for chicha, which, through its color, alluded both to semen and to frothy irrigation waters that flow from the mountains to the coast during the growing season. This suggestion seems to be supported by ethnographic and ethnohistoric data. Allen reports that both rainwater and chicha are regarded as seminal substances by Quechua speakers of the modern 8. My thanks to Mary LeCroy, ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was extremely generous with her time while making this tentative identification. Larco Hoyle (1938, I: 121) and Lavalle (1970: pi. 28C) also identify the bird respectively as a heron and an ibis, the latter being another wading bird related to the heron. 9. For their help in documenting the plant, my thanks to Dr. Brian Boom, associate curator at the New York Botanic Garden, who is reasonably certain that a cacao tree (genus Theobroma [Sterculiaceae]) is represented, and to Bernadette Callery, the Garden's research librarian. Dr. Boom's identification of the plant as the cacao, a tree native to the tropical lowlands, is supported by the presence in the scene of monkeys, also indigenous to the tropics. See Carrion Cachot 1959: 5; Hocquenghem 1987: 11) and Larco Hoyle 1965: 104 for other fertility-oriented readings of this scene. 10. Similar equations appear to be rather common in other cultures as well. For instance, see Reichel-Dolmatoff (1971: 48; 1975: 90, 140) on the Desana and Tukano of the Vaup?s region in the Colombian northwest Amazon; Rands (1955: 274) for such analogies in ancient Mesoamerica; Tedlock (1985: 114-115) on the Maya; and Turner (1967: 57-91, 64-65; 1969: 46, 121, 123) on the Ashanti and Ndembu of Africa, on the significance of the body and body products, and on associated color symbolism.</page><page sequence="8">Bergh: Death and renewal 85 Community Sonqu, near Cuzco (1982: 186, 188). Also, in a Huarochiri episode during which a woman seems to be impregnated through trickery by a god, she spills some chicha; the place where it pours onto the ground changes immediately into a spring of water (Urioste 1983: cap. 31, 409-415; see also Carrion Cachot 1955: 10). If chicha was used in the Moche vessels, it probably amplified and enriched the reference to irrigation water and to the powers of regeneration, because it is made of maize, an essential staple crop. Indeed, water itself may have been expressive in ancient times of the cycle of life and death. While fresh mountain water has been seen since ancient times as fecundating and regenerative, periodic torrential flooding, which occurs in the highlands as well as in coastal valleys, also causes water's association with the washing away of land and with death, both in the agricultural and human spheres (see, for example, Bastien 1973: 14; Urioste 1983: passim). Other associations Several flood myths, prevalent in Peru and surrounding areas in both colonial and modern times, seem to connect the mountains with ancestral origins. For instance, in a deluge myth collected by Molina (1917: 13-14) near Cuzco in the sixteenth century, all people perish in a flood predicted by llamas and the stars, save a few who escape to the top of a mountain, which rises up ahead of the flood until it peaks. When the waters recede, so, too, does the mountain, and these few survivors are left to repopulate the earth. This link between mountains and ancestral origins also is documented in other colonial sources, where some groups are said to have regarded superhuman natural features?very often sacred mountains?as their ultimate progenitors (Salomon n.d.: 6, 8). Also, in the Huarochiri manuscript, great mountain peaks are gendered as male and regarded as creators (Salomon 1991: 15), a conception echoed today among the people of ayllu Kaata, where the male ancestral line is associated with geographic height, erectness, and verticality, and the highlands generally with the origin of life (Bastien 1973: 14, 26, 103). Finally, Zuidema believes that the Inca of Cuzco regarded the mountain as a phallic symbol and, via this symbolism, that the mountain referred to the ancestors (1964: 160). It is possible, therefore, that the Moche regarded the highlands as a place of origins and life's beginnings, and that the penis, by virtue of its role in human reproduction, participated in this aspect of mountain symbolism. It is perhaps not coincidental to the Moche images that ancestors, both today (Allen 1982: passim) and in the sixteenth century (Salomon n.d.: passim), are regarded as a vital source of fertility by the living community. A related dimension of phallic symbolism is suggested by a group of figures in which the human head is given the shape of the penis's glans (fig. 9). This identification of head and phallus suggests that, in some situations, the head and the phallus were thought to share a common significance. Although current knowledge of Moche culture does not allow speculation on the exact symbolism of the head, it is noteworthy that the practice of decapitation among the Moche is recorded artistically, and that among peoples who practice decapitation, the head is frequently Figure 9.

Therefore, representations in which the human head is endowed with a phallic shape perhaps imply that the phallus symbolized similar concepts. This might be supported by effigy vessels of skeletal figures with phalluses that are, in spite of the figure's emaciation, shown as quite lifelike, and of either normal or exaggerated size; in a few of these, the erect phallus serves as spout. Although difficult to interpret without more detailed knowledge of the Moche concept of the afterworld, these figures may indicate that the phallus functioned as a symbol of vitality and life, even in death (Benson 1972: 152). One final, although unclear aspect of phallic symbolism may be revealed by the anthropomorphism of several phallic spouts. In this type of vessel, the erect phallus rises vertically from the center of the globular chamber. A small face with human features is modeled below the inverted V shape of the glans, and three dimensional arms are sometimes shown at the "shoulder" (see Larco Hoyle 1965: 22-23). A great many plants, animals, and objects in Moche art are shown in anthropomorphic states and, although the precise connotations of this treatment are still poorly understood, several of these figures have clear superordinary associations or status. For instance, a fanged god, one of the most important deities shown in Moche art, often is accompanied by a humanized lizard, whom Benson interprets as the supernatural's assistant (1972: 32). Thus, through their anthropomorphism, these representations may be related to the religious realm. In summary, through analogies to both the mountain and the head, the phallus appears to refer to a family of concepts concerning the origins and perpetuation of life, both in the human and agricultural realms and to related ideas of vitality and life essence. It is not surprising, then, that the phallus may have been thought to possess extraordinary characteristics, perhaps indicated by its link to the sacred highlands and by the anthropomorphism of several phallic representations. Considered with the vessels' funerary context, this constellation of associations suggests that the vessels functioned symbolically to affirm renewal and continuity of the human and natural cycles during breaches provoked by death. Indeed, the phallus itself may have served as a symbol for cyclic change and transition between life and death.11 This reading of phallic imagery also might shed light on other sexual representations in Moche art, particularly sodomy ?mages (fig. 10). Among other interpretations, sodomy scenes have been related to contraceptive measures (Kauffmann-Doig 1979: 37; Larco Hoyle 1965: 112; Gebhard 1970: 126); to the practice of sexual abstinence during agricultural festivals (Benson 1972: 148); and to non-fertility oriented ritual (Donnan 1978: 177). Thus, many have focused on the nonreproductive nature of this sexual practice. Another reading might result if the symbolism of the phallus is taken in conjunction with that perhaps associated with the bowel. As in other areas of the world, its meaning may have been connected to its function in elimination of body waste.12 Thus, the bowel may have been conceived of as an organ of dissolution, decay, and death (Turner 1967: 88-89) or, in Bakhtin's words, as the bodily grave (1968: 232 and passim). Therefore, the submersion of the phallus, organ of vitality, origins, and continuation, into the bowel might be seen metaphorically to duplicate the process of burial into an earthly grave. It is also interesting that, among the modern residents of ayllu Kaata, rich agricultural land at the center of the ayllu is equated with the bowel (Bastien 1973: 125, 165). The use of ethnographic information to interpret ancient material is clearly speculative, particularly in the absence of well-defined parallels in that material. However, if a connection between earth and bowel existed among the Moche, the phallus, whose semen was analogically related to irrigation water, then might be viewed as immersed in the earth, symbolized by the bowel, where it performs a renewing, fertilizing, and life-giving function. Extending this reading, the process of burial might then be seen as metaphorically related to planting. Turner's (1967: 88-89) research on the color black is relevant in this regard?he finds that many societies alternatively associate blackish substances, including feces, with the fertile earth and bodily decay. Through the latter connection, black also is linked with death and with periods of liminality, or of transition from one social status to another, which are viewed as times of social death (see below). If the above readings of the Moche material can be carried forward, sodomy scenes also may be viewed as metaphors for the cycle of death and life, of decay and regeneration, in both the human and agricultural spheres. Taken together, these interpretations result in a 11. As many have noted (see, for instance, Leach 1972: 339; Bloch and Parry 1982), symbolism modeled on the theme of fertility, rebirth, and renewal appears repeatedly in mortuary rituals. 12.

APPENDIX: A QUESTION OF HUMOR Aside from interpretations involving fertility, one aspect of which the above analysis has placed on more secure footing, another reading persistently offered for phallic-spouted vessels is that they were intended to express humor (Benson 1972: 146; Gebhard 1970: 120; Larco Hoyle 1965: 81-86; Osborne 1973: 83, 19).13 The most detailed argument so far given to support this idea is based on a suggestion, first advanced in print by Larco Hoyle (1965: 81-86), about how the vessels might have been manipulated. Aside from their phallic spouts, all of the vessels have an aperture through which they were filled. Because holes sometimes perforate the lip of this aperture, nothing can be poured from it without dousing the user with liquid (see figs. 1, 2). Thus, it is reasoned, the phallic spout must be resorted to, forcing the user to perform an act of fellatio, an act thought to have provoked hilarity. Regardless of the accuracy of this particular reconstruction?there is no reason to presume that spouts were used for drinking rather than simply for pouring?the humor hypothesis is so far purely intuitive. It does not account for the visual ploys on which humor might be based, the meaning of the vessels, the funerary context in which they were used, or the role that humor might have served in this context. Indeed, several problems hamper investigating the question of humor, not the least of which is lack of corroborative sources from the Moche themselves.14 Nevertheless, there is a certain fit between some theories of humor and several of the vessels' characteristics that would appear to extend and complement their fertility symbolism and funerary function. Infrequent in Western religious contexts, humor, sometimes of a sexual nature, is well documented in ritual settings from all over the world, including mortuary ceremonies.15 For instance, some modern Andean funerary and other rituals incorporate humor,16 and joking partners in Africa and north Mexico incite general hilarity, sometimes based on ribaldry, during the funerals of their partners (Beidelman 1966: 357, 363; Kennedy 1970: 41; Douglas 1975: 92, 108-109).17 Lewd pranks and buffoonery also are integral to ritual in the North American ceremonial clown tradition.18 Thus, neither the vessels' subject matter nor the context of final use contradicts an interpretation of humor. The visual mechanism on which the vessels' humor might be based is incongruity, expressed through physical exaggeration of the phallus and particularly its use as vessel spout. Incongruity is the concept central to an important body of theory addressing humor's cognitive origins.19 In the Moche ?mages, substitution 13. Another vessel type often taken to be "funny" is a female modeled in low relief on the false bottom of a shallow bowl. She reclines on her back with knees pulled up and to the side, revealing an exaggerated vulva that forms the aperture through which liquids are poured into the underlying reservoir (see Benson 1972: figs. 6 16). Larco Hoyle believes that these bowls humorously document the practice of cunnilingus, a practice depicted nowhere else in Moche sexual art (1965: 81). The splayed posture is used elsewhere in Moche art to indicate death (Donnan 1978: 83; 1981: 59; Kutscher 1950: 99), and the female is nude, a state in which captives are often portrayed. This may suggest that she is to be interpreted instead either as dead or dying. To account for these associations, it can be suggested that the bowls functioned as collectors of blood, perhaps from a sacrifice. Since blood would pass through the genital aperture, the image may have alluded both to loss of life through exsanguination and to menstruation. The implied comparison between menstrual and sacrificial blood may find a parallel in a modern native Andean association between menstruation and the dissolution of the body (Bastien 1973: 237). This interpretation, involving the metaphoric discharge of body fluids, is congruent with the reading given here to phallic-spouted vessels. See Sawyer, on the other hand, for the view that the female is about to give birth, although she lacks the swollen belly of pregnancy (1975: 26). 14. See Apte's excellent anthropological study of 1985 for a critique of the field of humor research, and Bergh (n.d.) for a discussion of these problems as they apply to the Moche material. 15. Although no cross-cultural survey of humor based on sex appears to have been conducted, Apte (1985) collects many examples of sexual humor. A few specific references to such humor in ethnographic societies include Radin (1956), who discusses the North American Indian trickster tradition, and citations given in the following three notes. 16. For funerary humor, see Bastien 1973: 199; Bolton 1977: 500; Carter 1968: 243; and Tschopik 1946: 551. Forbes (1870: 234) also mentions that Aymara speakers of the Lake Titicaca region performed humorous burlesque of Europeans during "feast days," and Isbell (1978: 201) and Tschopik (1946: 567) record associations among humor, sex, and fertility rituals in indigenous communities. 17. For the joking relationship, see Radcliffe-Brown's classic studies (1940; 1949). For more on the funerary association of the joking relationship, see Hammond 1964: 261; Rigby 1968: 135; Stefaniszyn 1950: 290; and Tew 1951: 122-124. 18. For the ritual clown tradition generally, as well as details of these activities, see Bricker 1973, Ortiz 1972, Parsons and Beals 1934, Steward 1931, Titiev 1944, and Wagley 1949. 19. Briefly, incongruity theories hold that humor arises from an</page><page sequence="12">Bergh: Death and renewal 89 of phallus for spout results in a pun on body process that appears to be based on the similarity in both appearance and function between vessel spouts and the phallus. This pun may have been extended by the use of the vessels to contain chicha, which, like semen, has a whitish color. This possibly humorous visual incongruity may be belied on a higher conceptual level by the intimate analogical relationship between semen and foamy irrigating water. Thus, the visual contradictions might be said to cooperate to reveal a deeper relationship between paradoxical elements, here consisting of the units [spout + chicha] and [phallus 4- semen]. Such a mechanism is fundamental to configurational or Gestalt theories, which posit that humor results when apparently unrelated elements fall into meaningful relation, providing insight that produces pleasure.20 Particularly pertinent is Douglas's related suggestion that the function of some incongruity-based jokes is to reveal the relevance of a level of meaning hidden under the superficial incongruity (1975: 104, 106, and passim). In the phallic-spouted vessels, this submerged meaning might have rested on the conceptual correspondence between semen and water as fecundating fluids and the vessels' consequent role in symbolically affirming renewal and continuity of both the human and agricultural cycles during periods of flux resulting from death. Indeed, in many societies, humor is thought to be used in several ways to state, reinforce, and renew normative values (for instance, Apte 1985: 236; Bricker 1973: 219-220). This observation can be deepened by examining the strikingly similar structural and functional characteristics of life crisis ceremonies and some humor experiences.21 Particularly relevant is the liminal period of rites of passage, during which all participants tend to be placed on an equal footing in an unstructured or undifferentiated community and share in a state that Turner refers to as communitas. According to Turner, the experience of communitas provides the group an opportunity to mutually examine, reaffirm, and revitalize its central values and axioms, and to regenerate the structures founded on them (1969: 138 and passim). These structural and functional characteristics are similar to those identified by Coser for certain humor experiences (1960: 81-82). She comments that humor calls for closer participation than many other forms of group behavior and that collective humor appreciation, such as might have occurred during funerary rituals, assumes some common definition of a situation. Thus, a group response to humor often results in a temporary lowering of social and other barriers. This equalizing action might be seen as parallel to the state achieved during periods of liminality. Accordingly, it is not surprising that jest is used in many societies to infuse the ritual group with a sense of communitas (Turner 1969: 202). Coser further notes that during periods of equalization resulting from communal response to humor, the group is allowed to withdraw together and, as during periods of liminality, to renew jointly held values in a spirit of mutuality and reciprocity. These observations about liminality and humor can be found relevant to the Moche sexual images in light of Douglas's analysis of the joke as containing both destructive and regenerative features within its structure, and her consequent suggestion that the joke both mimics a kind of death and suggests the theme of rebirth (1975: 109). Although she does not specifically address incongruity-based humor, such as may be expressed by phallic-spouted images, it is perhaps especially in this sort of joke, by the dialectical play it sets up between two disparate elements, that the process of leveling, dissolution, and re-creation noted by Douglas may be most evident. It might be said, therefore, that certain kinds of humor, particularly humor that is incongruity based, replicate the process of separation, liminality, and incorporation of passage rites and, correspondingly, also serve to assert themes of continuity, regeneration, and renewal, a function that is suggested here for phallic-spouted vessels.22 Another role played by humor may have been providing relief from tension. Fine, one of many to write on humor's role as a release mechanism, points unusual pairing of circumstances or ideas, or from interruption of usual patterns of behavior or thought. Incongruity-based humor, sometimes involving physical or behavioral exaggeration, seems to be strongly expressed cross-culturally (see, for example, Apte 1985: chaps. 5, 7, and passim; Jacobs 1960; Skeels 1954a,b). For reviews of humor theory and bibliographies based primarily on modern Western humor, see Berlyne 1968-1969, Keith-Spiegel 1972, Milner 1972, and Smith 1969. 20. Both incongruity and configurational theories take paradoxical juxtaposition as prerequisite to humor. However, incongruity theories focus on perception of dissimilarity per se, whereas configurational models emphasize a "falling into place" of unrelated elements as the basis for humor (Keith-Spiegel 1972: 11). 21. For life crisis ceremonies, see especially van Gennep (1960: 146 and passim) and Turner (1967: 97ff.; 1969: 95ff. and passim). 22. See Bakhtin (1968) for an analysis of medieval and Renaissance humor, which similarly stressed laughter's positive, regenerating, and creative meaning.</page><page sequence="13">90 RES 24 AUTUMN 1993 out that humor is often not random, but seems to cluster around stress points marked by ambiguity and anxiety, for which it acts as a purgative agent (1977: 317).23 Two types of tension alleviated by any humor in the Moche images may have been those provoked by sex and by death, which are perhaps universally sources of uncertainty and stress. A third origin of ambiguity was certainly the vagaries of the agricultural cycle, especially the seasonal flow of water. Since, as we have seen, semen may have been connected analogically with foamy mountain water used for irrigation, the humor of phallic-spouted vessels might have served to lessen tension produced by agricultural concerns. Implied in this cathartic effect is a restorative, normalizing action of the sort mentioned above. Of course, several caveats can be raised against the finding of a humorous dimension in Moche phallic spouted vessels?among others, physical exaggeration and isolation of the phallus may have been intended simply to underline its centrality as a symbolic element, since other Moche forms are stressed through enlarged size and presentation as images isolated out of context. Also, because incongruity is in general a characteristic of the supernatural or sacred, incongruous representation may have signified the superordinary nature of the phallus and of the substances and concepts with which it was associated.24 However, the parallels in structure and function among incongruity based jokes, rites of passage rituals, and certain group humor experiences, if taken in conjunction with other evidence, may support the hypothesis that a humorous intention is also present in these images. If so, it is in accord with the vessels' mortuary and fertility associations. 23. See citations in n. 19 for summaries of and bibliographies on the relief theory, based on Western humor. A relief function also has been hypothesized for the humor of cultures around the world. For instance, among the North American Chinook, humor appears to pinpoint certain social values whose attainment is marked by uncertainty, such as social status and a high degree of personal skill and competence (Jacobs 1960: 182). For suggestions that relief also operates in the African and north Mexican joking partner institutions, see Apte 1985: chap. 1; Douglas 1975: 108-109; Hammond 1964: 264; Murdock 1960: 276, 282; Radcliffe-Brown 1949: 195; and Rigby 1968: 51.
