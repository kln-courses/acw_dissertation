<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3The Academic Analysts of the  R elationship Between Religion  and S cience In addition to scientists and theologians in the academic debate, there are a number  of other academics who are analysts or observers of the relationship between science  and religion who, I will show, are also teaching the public the systemic knowledge  perspective. In this chapter I will focus on the two most active groups, the historians  and the sociologists. Historians show, for example, that Victorian era scientists often  thought they were investigating the details of God’s creation, and thus there was  harmony in religious and scientific knowledge. Sociologists assume that the spread  of scientific knowledge is a cause of the loss of religious belief. As in the previous  chapter, I will also offer an explanation of why these fields see the relationship in this  way. I will particularly focus upon explaining this view within the field of sociology,  given that it often focuses on the general public, and I am claiming that the public  does not use systemic knowledge to understand science and religion. HISTORIANS OF RELIGION AND SCIENCE In recent decades, historians have been on a quest to debunk the claim of the inevita- ble conflict between religion and science over knowledge about the world. They want  to replace the universal knowledge conflict narrative with descriptions of the lim- ited times and places such conflict has occurred, and emphasize the other times and  places where there was no conflict over knowledge.1 While debunking the simplistic  view of universal conflict, the historians nonetheless inadvertently reinforce the idea  that the relationship, and any conflict, is by definition about systemic knowledge. It is difficult to generalize about the complexity that historians see in the rela- tionship between religion and science. Metaphorically, imagine two stages facing  44 </page> <page sequence="2"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    45 each other. On one is a cast of one hundred characters, each representing a differ- ent religion in a different time and place. On the other is a cast of one hundred  characters, each representing a different conception of science in a different time  and place. As the numerous combinations of characters stand one at a time at the  front of each stage and face the other, historians may write about that relation- ship. For example, the character representing mid-eighteenth-century American  science looks little like the science character today. That character could face a   mid-nineteenth-century Catholic religion character, an evangelical Protestant reli- gion character, a Jewish religion character and so on—each of which would have  a different relationship with that particular version of science. Only some would  be in conflict, and others would be in perfect harmony. Given these historical par- ticularities, we can see that there was not a universal conflict in the Middle Ages,  for example, because Isaac Newton was religious. Similarly, in the late Victorian  era there was not universal knowledge conflict because many Anglicans agreed  with Darwin about evolution. And, in early twentieth-century America, there was  conflict between Darwinism and many conservative Protestants. Again, this link across the stages is almost always about knowledge claims about  nature, thus reinforcing the knowledge conflict narrative. There are also social,  political, personality, disciplinary, and other conflicts described, but these are  usually part of explaining a knowledge conflict. There are sometimes instances of  moral conflict identified, particularly for the twentieth-century debates, but these  are not separately theorized, and I will focus on discussing these in Chapter 4. I start with the extremely influential late twentieth-century summary statement  of historical work in this area, John Hedley Brooke’s encyclopedic history Science  and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives. The book starts in the sixteenth century  and generally proceeds chronologically. As we go through Galileo to Darwin and  so forth, it is quite clear that the relationship between science and religion—be it  supportive, conflictual, subsuming, or anything else—is about systemic knowl- edge. To take but one of the innumerable possible examples, he discusses Isaac  Newton’s “apprehension lest a fully mechanized universe might cripple divine  activity.” We can almost see Newton trying to make consistent and systematize all  of the knowledge in his pyramid when Brooke describes Newton’s dilemma: His disenchantment with the cosmology of Descartes was partly due to the boldness  with which the French philosopher had presumed to show how an organized solar  system could develop from a disorganized distribution of matter. Newton insisted  that organization could not result from disorganization without the mediation of  an intelligent power. As if to defuse the deistic tendencies of Cartesian philosophy,  Newton scrutinized the universe for evidence of divine involvement. . . . Because his  voluntarist theology allowed events in nature to be explained both as the result of  mechanism and of the divine will, there was a difficulty in determining what kind of  event would most demonstrate divine involvement.2 </page> <page sequence="3"> 46    Chapter Three Anticipating my claim about late twentieth-century elite moral debates about sci- ence, which I will examine in the next chapter, the final 10 of the 347 pages in the  book are about “science and human values” in the twentieth century. In that sec- tion, portrayed as a very recent development in the long history of religion and sci- ence, but prefigured in various ways, Brooke discusses controversies surrounding  human reproductive technologies and the moral problems supposedly caused by  Darwinism. He is largely not discussing history, but what were at the time of his  writing current events. Like other historians who view this development in the cur- rent time or very recent history, it is not seen as a change in the relationship between  religion and science, and not the imminent decline of debates about knowledge,  but more like an additional wrinkle that has emerged in recent decades.3 We could use any other of the histories of science and religion to describe  conflict over systemic knowledge. But one of my favorite examples comes  from Peter Bowler, who examines debates about religion and science in early   twentieth-century Britain, and shows heroic attempts at iron-clad logical con- sistency in knowledge and belief by the elites of the time. One debate was about  whether materialism, a belief high in the scientific knowledge structure, could be  changed to make room for religion. Some solutions included the idea that “mat- ter itself was mysterious, and thus offered no suitable foundation for the kind of  materialism that sought to eliminate mind and purpose from nature.” Another  was that “ether theory” would allow for a worldview “that was still in touch with  science, but which transcended materialism and allowed the scientist to believe  that the universe as a whole was a divine construct.” The general idea was to take  abstract scientific beliefs like materialism and make them compatible with reli- gious belief and vice versa.4 Given the voluminous output of historians, it is difficult to easily demonstrate  the utter dominance of their assumption that any relationship between science  and religion concerns knowledge of the natural world at minimum, and a systemic  knowledge relationship at maximum. I will make my case by summarizing the  103-chapter encyclopedia titled the History of Science and Religion in the Western  Tradition, published in the year two thousand, which contains chapters from most  of the prominent historians of religion and science of the time.5 The table of con- tents give us the general story. Part 1 is titled “The Relationship of Science and  Religion,” and there is not an entry titled “Morality” or “Moral Debates.” However,  there are fourteen entries that all refer to knowledge, such as “Natural Theology”  and “Views of Nature.”6 These are followed by “Biographical Studies” of Galileo,  Pascal, Newton, and Darwin—who we know of because of their roles in major  transformations of our understanding of knowledge of the natural world. The next section is titled “Intellectual Foundations and Philosophical  Backgrounds.” These twenty-six chapters are even more clearly focused on knowl- edge generation, with topics such as “Cartesianism,” “Baconianism,” and “German  </page> <page sequence="4"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    47 Nature Philosophy.”7 Part 4 contains twelve chapters concerning “specific religious  traditions and chronological periods.”8 The encyclopedia then turns for the final  forty-seven entries to the history of groups of disciplines making fact-claims about  nature. These are grouped under the headings of “Astronomy and Cosmology,”  “The Physical Sciences,” “The Earth Sciences,” “The Biological Sciences,” “Medicine  and Psychology,” and “The Occult Sciences.” This is not to say that moral conflict is unmentioned in the over six hundred  tightly packed pages of this encyclopedia. Rather, it is not central and not theo- rized. The first two framing essays are telling. In the first, historian David Wilson  examines the historiography of science and religion, and it is clear that the histori- ography up to that point was about the relationship between science and religion  over knowledge about the physical world.9 The next chapter is a summary of all  historical studies on the conflict with science and religion, and historian Colin  Russell outlines the “issues of contention.” The first is purely systemic knowledge,  “in the area of epistemology: Could what we know about the world through science  be integrated with what we learn about it from religion?” An example involves “the  Copernican displacement of the earth from the center of the solar system.” The  second issue is also purely systemic, and has been in the realm of methodology,  between a “science based on ‘facts’ and a theology derived from ‘faith.’”10 So far he  is describing conflict over ways of knowing facts—a belief far up each pyramid. Russell identifies another conflict, which he calls “social power.” Here he points  to historiography of religion and science that concerns knowledge conflict, but the  explanation for the conflict is that the debate is not really about knowledge, but an  attempt to undermine the power of institutional religion or science in society. His  example is the efforts of the scientific naturalists associated with Thomas Henry  Huxley and their attempt to overthrow the hegemony of the English church.11 This  is still concerned with knowledge conflict, it is just that the motive for the conflict  is not truth itself. The final conflict he identifies is “in the field of ethics,” and this unintention- ally demonstrates that historians have almost exclusively focused on knowledge  conflict. The final conflict seems to contradict my claims in this section. However,  unlike the other conflicts he identifies, and like Brooke, he turns from the histori- cal literature to contemporary society, saying “most recently this has been realized  in questions about genetic engineering, nuclear power, and proliferation of insec- ticides.” Again, like Brooke, he gestures to the few nineteenth century cases that  have been discussed by historians—such as debates about the morality of vac- cination and anesthesia and moral reaction to Darwin—but then turns back to  the present, writing that these have been replaced by “conflict over abortion and  the value of fetal life.” He then distances historians from this version of conflict by  writing that “in nearly all of these cases, however, it is not so much science as its  application (often by nonscientists) that has been under judgment.”12 I take this to  </page> <page sequence="5"> 48    Chapter Three be an oblique reference to present-day reality, but also an acknowledgment that  historians have largely not focused on this type of conflict. Historians have seen  the same social phenomena as I have in the contemporary world, but they have not  worked out its implications. Explaining Historians’ Focus On Knowledge Conflict Historians are not wrong, but their claims need to be restricted to history and not  the present day. The first and most important reason the historians are correct is  that historians largely study and write about the elites who spent time thinking  about religion and/or science, and such persons are more concerned with systemic  knowledge. Ronald Numbers writes that historians have had little to say about  popular views of religion and science, and even regrets that two of his own edited  volumes have neglected the views of the public.13 There are good reasons for this  neglect. One is, especially for historical studies before the nineteenth century, that  what the actual “common folk” thought was irrelevant to what was going to hap- pen in society and to the evolution of debates about religion and science. These  societies were not democratic in the same way we think of them today, with no  public spheres to provide input from the governed to the governors. Illiteracy was  widespread, and the vast majority of the people in a country would have been pri- marily concerned with their own survival. In fact, most social elites did not even  have the time to understand science. An early historian of the Royal Society wrote  that Descartes and Newton’s mechanistic view of the universe, “could be known  but only to those, who would throw away all their whole Lives upon it. . . . It was  made too subtle, for the common, and gross conceptions of men of business.”14 Moreover, the historians have focused on elites, and thus on systemic knowl- edge conflict, because the common folk, in Numbers’ explanation, “left little evi- dence of their thoughts, and much of what we have is filtered through the writings  of those who observed them.”15 Of course, historians have tried to get as close to  the public’s views as possible. Peter Bowler’s book is almost exclusively about elites,  but he tried to get some information about the public by examining how many  books were sold to the public. For example, he examined sales of popular novels  by HG Wells, but unfortunately this cannot tell us too much about what ordinary  people were thinking.16 Bernard Lightman has similarly written about the popu- larizers of science in the Victorian era, and these popularizers, while elites, were  one step closer to the public than other elites.17 James Secord was able to painstak- ingly compile evidence of readers’ responses to the Vestiges of the Natural History  of Creation, a naturalistic pre-Darwin British account of human origins. Letters,  diaries, publicity for events, and even handwritten marginalia were all obtained— but this sort of study is the exception, not the rule, because these data rarely exist,  and certainly would be extremely fragmentary before the nineteenth century.18 </page> <page sequence="6"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    49 The second reason that historians have focused on knowledge conflict, besides  their necessary focus on elites, is that it is quite plausible that the farther one goes  back in time, the more the debate between religion and science was about systemic  knowledge for both the elites and the public. As Harrison and other historians  have so convincingly shown, what “science” and “religion” have been over time  has changed. The rise of our contemporary version of science in the nineteenth  century, and its separation from religion, has meant that science is responsible for  the vast majority of knowledge about the world. I would argue that while religion  used to see one of its tasks as explaining the natural world, religion in the U.S. has  moved away from this task, and that this long process has accelerated within the  lifetimes of many of the current scholars in the religion and science debate—or so  I will argue in Chapter 5. So, the focus of historians on knowledge conflict may not  only be due to the focus on elites, but because there was knowledge conflict fifty  or more years ago. SO CIOLO GY AND SYSTEMIC KNOWLED GE C ONFLICT If I am right about the differences in reasoning between elites and the public, we  would expect that since social scientists often study the contemporary public, they  will not describe conflict between religion and science as between two hierarchi- cally organized knowledge systems. However, they have, up until the most recent  years, assumed the same conflict that other academics see. In part this is because,  at least historically, many of the social science studies of religion and science have  been of elite scientists. However, even those who study public opinion surveys  have assumed systemic knowledge conflict. As I will explain later in this section,  this is a result of the deep assumptions of social science derived from its origins  in the nineteenth century. While a variety of social scientists have contributed to  these debates, and I will touch upon this variety, the debates about religion and  science in the industrialized West have been dominated by sociologists. Before engaging in my interpretation of the impact of the sociological litera- ture, I should acknowledge the one study that more directly examines the extent  to which social scientists believe in, and pass on to students, the idea of a systemic  knowledge conflict between religion and science. An empirical examination of the  content of contemporary anthropology textbooks shows that they depict a situa- tion where “science and religion have always been, and will continue to be, bitter  adversaries.” The author did not design his study to examine knowledge vs. moral  conflict, but it is quite clear from his quotations that these anthropology textbooks  depict the irredeemable conflict as concerning knowledge. For example, when  anthropology textbooks depict religious reaction to Darwin, depictions include  “the intense conflict between the new evolution paradigm in science and an out- moded static worldview in religion” and “evolution and the principle of common  </page> <page sequence="7"> 50    Chapter Three descent demolished the scientific plausibility of creation and design for the uni- verse.” This conflict is depicted as continuing to this day, as “evolution remains an  active source of debate in many societies due to the fundamental contradictions  between religious interpretation and scientific investigation.”19 The author’s inves- tigation of sociology textbooks reaches a similar conclusion.20 At least these two  social sciences directly teach the systemic knowledge conflict to their students. Sociological Theory The tendency to depict the relationship between religion and science, and there- fore any conflict, as concerning knowledge has been most marked in sociological  theory. To be fair, most of this high theory is making historical claims, or was writ- ten long ago, and knowledge conflict may well have been the situation in the past.  However, without exposure to studies of contemporary religious people, students  learning these theories will presume that the depiction of religion and science is  accurate today. Consider as an example the theory of the rationalization of religion. German  social theorist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, viewed  religion as becoming more rationalized with time, and believed that the  Protestantism of the Reformation was a particularly strong example of this pro- cess. In the words of Peter Berger, one of the most influential interpreters of  Weber’s sociology of religion: The Catholic lives in a world in which the sacred is mediated to him through a variety  of channels—the sacraments of the church, the intercession of the saints, the recur- ring eruption of the “supernatural” in miracles—a vast continuity of being between  the seen and the unseen. Protestantism abolished most of these mediations.  .  .  .  This reality then became amenable to the systematic, rational penetration, both in  thought and in activity, which we associate with modern science and technology.  A sky empty of angels becomes open to the intervention of the astronomer and,  eventually of the astronaut. It may be maintained, then, that Protestantism served as  a historically decisive prelude to secularization, whatever may have been the impor- tance of other factors.21 Rationalization in religion had resulted in a situation where mysterious forces and  powers were replaced by the calculation and technical means embodied in mod- ern science. This then leads to religion reducing the number of truth claims about  the world that are not compatible with the “systematic, rational penetration” that  we “associate with modern science and technology.” This may well be an accurate  depiction of how religions have changed in the West over time. Note that in this  account religion is resolutely about knowledge, and a religious perspective on how  the world operates is in conflict with the scientific perspective. </page> <page sequence="8"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    51 Studies of the Religiosity of Scientists Many participants in the historical or theological debate about religion and science  will be most familiar with the sociological studies of the religiosity of scientists,  which have been the most consistently used research design in the sociology of  religion and science over the past fifty years. These studies not only presume that  any conflict between science and religion is about knowledge, but are testing for  the presence of the strong version of the systemic knowledge relationship between  religion and science. They assume that scientists are metaphysical naturalists,  holding a rigidly coherent belief system up to first principles—a similar strength of  coherence that Dawkins demands where believing in scientific fact-claims means  you cannot have one non-scientific belief (such as the existence of God). Thus, this  research design is used to determine if scientists have any religious belief. Since it  is assumed that the most elite scientists are those who have thought the most about  how scientific knowledge is justified, the assumption of this research is that they  should then be much less religious than the public. Early twentieth-century studies of the religious beliefs of scientists found that  scientists were less religious than were the public, and that higher-status scientists  were the least religious of all.22 A study of graduate students in the early 1960s also  came to the same conclusion, and found that the students who were better edu- cated and who were doing what was necessary to achieve higher scientific status  were less involved with religion.23 But later studies found that social scientists were even less religious than natural  scientists, despite their being less “scientific.”24 While this evidence still supported the  knowledge conflict thesis, it subverted the linearity of the model, and being more sci- entific did not necessarily mean being less religious. Scholars explained this variously  as an effect of “scholarly distance from religion,” or as a “boundary posturing mecha- nism” by social scientists trying to appear more scientific by being less religious.25 Current research suggests that while scientists are less religious than the public,  just as in the early twentieth century, religiosity (in varying forms) is persistent  among scientists.26 Elite scientists at top research universities remain much less  conventionally religious with, for example, 28 percent of the population being  evangelical but only 2 percent of elite scientists identifying with this tradition.  Similarly, 27 percent of the population but only 9 percent of elite scientists are  Catholic. More generally, 16 percent of the public but 53 percent of elite scientists  do not have a religious identity.27 (Studies of super-elite scientists, such as mem- bers of the National Academy of Sciences, find very few who believe in a personal  God.)28 Differences in religiosity across the scientific status hierarchy are lessen- ing, so that being in a more “scientific” discipline is a less useful predictor of the  religiosity than many other characteristics of the scientist, such as age, marital  status, and childhood religious background.29 </page> <page sequence="9"> 52    Chapter Three Ecklund and Scheitle critique the literature in this tradition by writing that it  “supports the perception there is a conflict between the principles of religion and  those of science, such that those who pursue science tend to abandon religion,  either because of an inherent conflict between knowledge claims or because sci- entific education exerts a secularizing force.”30 This literature then presumes that  religious people will not only avoid areas of science that make contrary claims to  religion—as is the case with conservative Protestantism and biology—but all sci- ence, because people are assumed to be logically consistent and cannot believe one  scientific claim without believing in all of them.31 This literature has traditionally  been part of the debate about the causes of secularization, because it was thought  to be a test of whether scientific belief leads to a decline of religious belief. The most recent studies of elite scientists have begun to look for reasons  beyond the idea that religion and science are conflicting knowledge systems  where the conflict is relieved by abandoning religion. For example, more recent  studies by Ecklund and her colleagues have shown that religiosity of the home  when one is a child is the most important predictor of present religiosity among  elite scientists, that science is more like an identity that is threatened by a reli- gious identity, and that most elite scientists do not perceive a conflict between  science and religion.32 Sociological Survey Researchers In later chapters, I will be showing evidence from surveys about whether contem- porary religious people are in different types of conflict with science. However,  up until very recently it has not been possible to demarcate types of conflict due  to a lack of data on anything beyond the amount of scientific knowledge held by  a religious respondent. Moreover, sociological survey researchers have been able  to determine whether contemporary religious people avoid science in various  ways, but do not know why avoidance is occurring. The dominant assumption in  this research is that which sociology inherits from its intellectual origins and the  broader academic debate—avoidance is due to systemic knowledge conflict, where  religious people avoid science because they disagree about some scientific facts  and do not want their belief system to be threatened. When survey researchers generalize, this conflict is often described as the strong  version of systemic knowledge conflict, where religion and science are incom- patible at the highest level of the pyramid. For example, sociologists Ellison and  Musick, before critiquing the view, summarize the dominant academic assump- tion about the incompatibility of any religious belief with science: Over the years, many observers have asserted that scientific materialism, as the  guiding ideology of the scientific community, is ontologically and e pistemologically  </page> <page sequence="10"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    53  incompatible with conventional Western religious belief  .  .  . In simplest terms,   scientific materialism holds (1) that matter (or matter and energy) is the fundamen- tal reality in the universe, and (2) that the scientific method is the only reliable means  to disclose the nature of this reality. . . . In contrast, Western religious traditions gen- erally assume that the universe and its inhabitants have been created by, and often are  guided by, a supreme intelligence that transcends the material world. . . . Moreover,  religious adherents embrace these tenets despite the lack of (a) public data, (b) exper- imental testing, and (c) standard evaluative criteria for ascertaining their validity.33 Empirical sociologists tend to limit their claims to particular religious groups, and  have focused on conservative Protestants because the elites in this tradition have  had the most public conflict with science. The assumption is that conservative  Protestants are in systemic knowledge conflict with science because they reject  the very basis of all science and instead look to God’s revelation for truth about  the natural world. The best place to view this assumption is in the social science  literature on educational attainment, where one central question is: why is there  a somewhat lower level of obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees among  conservative Protestants? In general, the exact reason cannot be assessed due to lack of data, so instead  scholars determine if people from particular religions really do have different  attainment, and then speculate about why, based on what is otherwise known  about society. (This is a common approach in social science.) The traditional  explanation is that conservative Protestants have less educational attainment  because they want to avoid scientific knowledge, which they are in conflict with.  For example, sociologist of religion Darren Sherkat, who generally claims that  conservative Protestants “view secular knowledge with considerable suspicion and  disdain,” writes that: In line with fundamentalist orientations towards knowledge, assessments of valid- ity are most often generated a priori—requiring little assessment of the relative fit  between events or data and abstract concepts. For many committed fundamental- ists the “truth” is known based on understandings and interpretations of funda- mentalist Christian sacred texts.  .  .  . The orientation towards knowledge which  tends to permeate conservative Christian belief systems precludes a systematic ex- amination of the complexities of human conflict or the natural world. . . . abstract  processes like disease, plate tectonics, or the scientific method can have diminished  cognitive consequence, since ultimately the gods are responsible for the dynamics  of earthly matter.34 Again, this is not propositional belief conflict where religion and science only con- flict over a few fact claims. Rather, religious people’s lack of belief in scientific  claims is due to their different method for justifying claims, which is systemic  knowledge conflict. </page> <page sequence="11"> 54    Chapter Three A slightly different argument is that conservative Protestants are opposed to  knowledge acquisition not generated through the method of biblical exegesis, and  thus would not want to learn about any science. In explaining what leads people  to obtain a graduate degree in science, two economists posit that conservative  Protestants will be less likely to obtain such a degree because “to the extent that  science is incompatible with a set of core Christian beliefs, and/or is antagonistic  to beliefs about the Bible as an inerrant source of truth, differences in belief among  individuals about the truth content of the Bible can generate differences in the util- ity and cost of acquiring a science education.”35 The authors continue by claiming  that conservative Protestants will be opposed to obtaining any knowledge itself,  and particularly any knowledge based upon materialism.36 Similarly, Sherkat writes that “according to some activists and adherents in con- servative Christian communities, the search for knowledge is often equated with  a sinful predisposition toward self-love and pridefulness—and juxtaposed with  the fundamentalist ideal of faithful and unquestioning servitude.”37 Again, this is a  claim of conflicting systems of belief, not individual fact-claims, as it is claimed that  conservative Protestants are opposed to all secular knowledge, because of how it  was generated, not just claims that contradict fact claims conservative Protestants  see in the Bible.38 Most of the sociological data cannot distinguish between knowledge and moral  conflict, so scholars offer explanations that reflect their assumptions. If what I say  in subsequent chapters is correct—that the dominant form of conflict among the  religious public is moral—it would be surprising if the sociologists who study con- temporary members of the general public did not see moral conflict at all in the  data. What we find is that these sociologists, particularly in more recent years,  unreflectively combine what I am calling knowledge conflict and moral conflict  explanations. My approach in later chapters will be to pull apart these two expla- nations and test them separately. As an example of this unreflective and untheorized mixing of explanations for  conflict, sociologists Andrew Greeley and Michael Hout imply that knowledge  conflict leads to moral conflict. In a survey analysis, they find that conservative  Protestants are less likely to agree that “science will solve our social problems,” and  more likely to agree that “science makes our way of life change too fast,” “scientists  always seem to be prying into things that they really ought to stay out of,” and  that “science breaks down people’s ideas of right and wrong.” Each of these state- ments is not about knowledge or facts about nature, but about the moral effect  of science. However, they interpret the responses to these moral questions not as  moral conflict, but as indicators of knowledge conflict. They write that “it is hardly  unexpected that the conservatives are skeptical about science” and “conservative  Protestants take their stands not because they are uneducated but because they  hold strong religious beliefs that take precedence over scientific facts.”39 In this  </page> <page sequence="12"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    55 passage, not only do religious beliefs take precedence over scientific facts—the  knowledge conflict assumption—but the moral conflict is actually a knowledge  conflict. In another example of such mixing of explanations, Sherkat theorizes that  he will find that conservative Protestants are less scientifically literate. The rea- son is their opposition to scientists’ claims about evolution, which are in conflict  with biblical claims, and “unscientific views of seismic events” like Pat Robertson  claiming that an earthquake hit Haiti because Haiti made a pact with Satan. But  in Sherkat’s argument for why conservative Protestants have less scientific knowl- edge, he unreflectingly includes disagreements that have nothing to do with  knowledge claims, such as “opposition to embryonic stem cell research,” and that  the students avoid “not only basic science courses, but also courses in social stud- ies and literature that may question conservative Christian values about tolerance,  social relations, sexuality and gender roles, and cultural diversity.”40 Similarly, a study of religion and wealth, unable to distinguish the mechanism  connecting the two phenomena, unreflectively asserts both moral and knowl- edge conflict in explaining what is seen as a pattern of conservative Protestants  attaining less education. The author writes that conservative Protestant “cultural  orientations tend to be at odds with the approaches of nonreligious schools and  universities that propagate secular humanist values  .  .  . and promote scientific  investigation rather than acceptance of divine truths.”41 Sociologist Kraig Beyerlein does offer a moral conflict explanation for a lack of  educational achievement for conservative Protestants in which the basic conflict  is the culture of universities more broadly. Beyerlein, citing Sherkat, says that one  possible reason conservative Protestants avoid college is “the scientific method  practiced in state colleges and universities threatens such conservative Protestant  world views as a creationist understanding of human origins and a literal interpre- tation of scripture.” But, he then adds a moral reason, which is that “the empha- sis on emancipation from traditional authority stressed in public institutions of  higher learning undercuts a variety of core theological and familial precepts of  conservative Protestantism, especially submissiveness of children to God and to  their parents.”42 Like the others in this research area he lacks the data to determine which con- flict is actually keeping conservative Protestants from college, but his conclusion  undermines the idea that it is only knowledge conflict. He finds that evangeli- cals have the same level of educational attainment as mainline Protestants as well  as higher attainment than fundamentalists or Pentecostals. This he attributes  to the fact that the “the cultural traditions of fundamentalist Protestantism and  Pentecostal Protestantism advocate withdrawing from the broader culture,” while  “the cultural tradition of evangelical Protestantism generally stresses engaging the  broader culture.”43 </page> <page sequence="13"> 56    Chapter Three THE ORIGINS OF SO CIOLO GICAL BIAS TOWARD  SEEING KNOWLED GE C ONFLICT I will spend more time on explaining sociological bias toward seeing knowledge  conflict than I spent on the other academic fields because sociology appears to  be such an anomaly. Assuming that the analysis I report in later chapters is cor- rect, and the contemporary religious public is primarily concerned with a moral  relationship with science, why have the sociologists who study the public not seen  moral conflict? It is important to recognize that social science thinks of itself as a science. Many  social scientists do not like that term because it implies they have the same positiv- ist epistemology as natural scientists. However, social science can be interpretiv- ist or positivistic; its analyses quantitative or qualitative; its methods observation,  interview, survey, or the summation of records—but social scientists share with  the natural scientists the basic Enlightenment ideal of making claims on the basis  of observation and reason. Therefore, it is not just that social scientists observe a relationship between nat- ural science and religion—they have their own relationship as a science with reli- gion. Using my pyramid metaphor in Figure 1 in Chapter 1, there would be a social  science pyramid and a religion pyramid, and as I will show below, the inherited  theories of social science presume that social science is in an extreme form of sys- temic knowledge conflict with religion. Both social science and religion are seen  as systems of justified beliefs about the world, with methods and theories halfway  up each pyramid. Therefore, when sociologists see natural science in relationship  with religion, they presume that religion is a hierarchical system of belief about the  super-natural, and that empirically observed facts about the world by science will  undermine the foundations of this belief. Put simply, both natural and social sci- ence see religion as a really inaccurate system of developing fact-claims about the  world. How did social science—and sociology in particular—develop this view? The answer is that sociology was born with the strong version of systemic  knowledge conflict in its DNA—akin to that of the scientific atheists—and thus  this perspective is built into sociological theories. Like the scientific atheists, sociol- ogy depicts religion as a hierarchical system of justified belief that can be shown to  be false by (social) science. With this assumption built into sociology, it is hard for  sociologists to see any debate involving religion and science that is about morality. To understand this bias in sociology, we should remind ourselves of the dis- tinction between the strong and weak systemic knowledge conflict—between  methodological naturalism (“a disciplinary method that says nothing about God’s  existence”) and metaphysical naturalism (which “denies the existence of a tran- scendent God.”)44 Sociology was born in the Enlightenment era, assuming both  methodological and metaphysical naturalism. </page> <page sequence="14"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    57 The social science version of methodological naturalism is that a social scientist  cannot invoke the supernatural in explanations of social behavior. For example, a  social scientist cannot claim that God causes wars. The social science version of  metaphysical naturalism is that if we believe social scientific explanations of social  behavior we also cannot believe that God exists. With metaphysical naturalism  built into sociology, it is easy to see why sociologists have not seen moral conflict  with science. Like other scientists, they define religion as that which makes (false)  knowledge claims about the world. The Origins of Social Science and Methodological  and Metaphysical Naturalism Historically, the natural sciences adopted methodological naturalism, and much  later a small subgroup of atheist scientists began to promote metaphysical natu- ralism. In contrast, social science was born as a challenge to religious authority,  and thus began by assuming metaphysical naturalism. Metaphysical naturalism  presumes or subsumes methodological naturalism. Social scientists, not natural  scientists, were the original scientific atheists. For our purposes, the origin of social science is in the Enlightenment of  seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe. One of the central concepts in  Enlightenment thought was that people should use their own senses and reason  to evaluate the physical and social worlds, and not tradition, faith, or religious  authority. The first proto-social scientists were Enlightenment figures such as  Montesquieu, Smith, Condorcet, and Herder, whose work was premised on the  idea that history was caused by human action. While this seems obvious today,  this was a change from earlier conceptions in which humans influenced history  but history was ultimately under God’s control. By the early nineteenth century all  of reality, including what had previously been seen as immutable and unchanging,  came to be seen in contextual historical terms.45 Building on earlier Enlightenment ideas, the “scientific” aspirations of the first  social scientists were the result of the natural science triumphs of the era. Natural  scientists had been seen as successful in explaining all sorts of natural phenomena,  and the proto-social scientists wanted to transplant those successes to understand- ing the social world. For example, French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798–1857)  is often portrayed as the founder of both sociology and positivism. He looked to  natural science as an inspiration for understanding society, and invented “sociol- ogy” to “complete the scientific revolution by bringing human phenomena within  the orbit of positive study.” Moreover, reflecting the metaphysical naturalism of  the Enlightenment-era social scientists, he tried to make positivism a “new world- religion to replace Christianity,” complete with an ecclesiology—with social scien- tific experts at the apex of priestly authority. His metaphysical naturalism—which  </page> <page sequence="15"> 58    Chapter Three held that religion is a set of beliefs about the world that are false—was clear in his  depiction of the stages of history, stages that reflected standard nineteenth century  beliefs about progress. The first stage, infancy, was based in theology that assumed  religion is about claims to nature (“the anthropomorphic projection of fictive  causes”). The second, adolescence, is based on metaphysics, the rule of abstract  ideas. The third, maturity, is “positive,” and based on “evidential knowledge hav- ing the form of laws.”46 In this scheme, belief in transcendent force is evidence of  a backward society. Enlightenment-era social scientists gathered social facts in the pursuit of moral  causes. Social science was designed to “liberate humankind from ignorance and  oppression,” with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, arguing against inequality  and for the dignity of the person.47 As contemporary sociologist Malcolm Williams  writes, there was an important “difference between the natural and social sciences  in the nineteenth century—even at their most avowedly scientific. The latter were  not just about how the world ‘is’ but how it ‘ought’ to be.”48 One of these “oughts”  was demonstrating that religion is false. Anthropology is like sociology in its presuppositions about religion and indeed,  “throughout its entire history as an academic discipline, anthropology has been  perceived as having an ethos that is predominantly hostile to religious convictions,  especially those of Christianity.” Founding anthropologists of the time shared  Comte’s view of progress and the idea that religion was based on false claims about  nature. Edward Tylor, the first person to hold a faculty appointment in anthro- pology and often called “the father of anthropology,” saw three stages of human  history: savage, barbaric, and civilized. In his theory, “religion is fundamentally  the erroneous thought of ‘savages’ that has continued into civilized contexts by  sheer, unreflective conservatism, even though its false intellectual foundations  have now been exposed.” In fact, “anthropology should be a ‘reformer’s science,’  which actively worked to eradicate religion from modern civilization.”49 The most famous anthropologist of the generation after Tylor was James Frazer,  whose stages of history were magic, religion, and science. Religion and science  were locked in a battle over true knowledge, as he thought that “religion gives  primitive, irrational answers to questions correctly answered by science.” He too  saw one purpose of this social science as demonstrating that religion is a set of  false beliefs, believing that “anthropologists should work to ensure that science  would increase and religion decrease,” writing that “it is for those who care for  progress to aid the final triumph of science as much as they can in their day.”50 The first sociological theorists, building on Enlightenment thought, devel- oped more elaborate theories that promoted metaphysical naturalism, using  social science reasoning to explain how religious belief was false, and actually  reducible to social forces. Karl Marx (1818–1883), Max Weber (1864–1920), and  Emile Durkheim (1858–1917) later became known as the “classical theorists” of  </page> <page sequence="16"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    59 sociology or, pejoratively but tellingly, the “holy trinity” of classical sociological  theorists. These three would ultimately be more directly influential than the earlier  Enlightenment figures, and were clearly engaged in an agenda of metaphysical  naturalism. What these three shared was an assumption that individual humans were alien- ated from the objective world, and that therefore people do not realize that the  social forces that act upon them are actually the result of human activity. The cen- tral purpose of the classic sociologists was then “demystification”—to make people  aware of humanity’s own control over itself. Critically, religious belief was one of  the primary institutionalized ideas that people needed to become aware was not a  force outside of humanity, but something that humans had invented. For example,  for Marx, religious beliefs are caused by the relations of the means of production  in a particular era, and religion is one aspect of false consciousness that humanity  needs to see through in order to experience true liberation. In its bumper-sticker  version, religion is the “opiate of the masses” depriving humanity of the correct  perception of who is oppressing them. Durkheim similarly argued that people do not realize that it was they who cre- ated religious symbolism, not some transcendent force, and that religion was a  metaphorical representative of the society. If people would agree with Durkheim’s  insight that sacred symbols were actually a reflection of social relationships, this  fact would undermine religion in the same way that showing humans had evolved  from lower primates would do. The general goal of the classic sociologists was to  show “that the force believed in as divine entities were merely reflections of social  experience.”51 Classical sociology argued that not only should social science use  methodological naturalism, but also that social scientists have an obligation to  promote metaphysical naturalism to further human freedom. Social science and  religion were not compatible or capable of synthesis—the point of social science  was to show that religion is false. To this day, sociology PhD programs in the U.S.  begin the first semester with a class devoted to these classical theorists. Sociology in America At the same time the classical sociologists were writing in Europe, on the west  side of the Atlantic social science was coming into its own. Historians point to this  period, between the end of the American Civil War and World War I, as a trans- formative time for naturalist thought in American academia. Before this period,  American natural scientists tended to believe that science described the details of  God’s creation, and thus science was ultimately supportive of theological claims.52  But, “increasingly after 1870,” write historians Jon H. Roberts and James Turner,  “scientists preferred confessions of ignorance to invocations of supernaturalism.”53  It helped that the dominant version of Christianity in academia of the time was  </page> <page sequence="17"> 60    Chapter Three what would now be called liberal Protestantism where, for example, the Bible was  not thought of as literally true in all details. The growing specialization within academia contributed to the emergence of  distinct social science disciplines, and what we would now consider social science  was at the time embedded in courses on moral philosophy. Specialization meant  carving off the social aspects of the field of moral philosophy, and the proto-social  scientists of the time thought this specialization was critical for their future growth  in the universities.54 The proto-social scientists allied themselves with the increas- ingly powerful natural sciences which, by this time, were reaching consensus on  methodological naturalism. Roberts and Turner describe it well: As disciplines that self-consciously sought to ally themselves with the natural sci- ences, the human sciences were in a very real sense born with a commitment to  methodological naturalism, as . . . the natural sciences had already rendered exclu- sion of the supernatural from discourse quite conventional. Indeed, the notion that it  was essential to restrict discourse and patterns of explanation to natural agencies and  events had become one of the reigning assumptions in conceptions of what it meant  to do science. Disciplines with aspirations to anchor themselves within institutions  dedicated to scientific inquiry and production of knowledge could ill afford to incur  the taint of “speculation” by incorporating God into their analysis.55 American sociologists reached back to European figures like Comte, and built  metaphysical naturalism and systemic knowledge conflict into the bedrock of  American sociology. Ironically, American sociology started as a field that col- lected social data for the Social Gospel movement—a late nineteenth-century  religious social reform movement.56 As Northern Baptist pastor and influential  social gospel advocate Walter Rauschenbusch wrote, “we need a combination of  the Kingdom of God and the modern comprehension of the organic development  of human society . . . So directing religious energy by scientific knowledge that a  comprehensive and continuous reconstruction of social life in the name of God is  within the bounds of human possibility.”57 These religious social reformers were  methodological but not metaphysical naturalists. As contemporary sociologist  Michael Evans writes, “most Social Gospel writers committed themselves to scien- tific approaches and knowledge without committing to the underlying secularism  of Comte or Spencer.”58 A competing faction of sociologists that wanted to be seen as forwarding an  objective science of society regarded any association with religion as detracting  from that goal.59 This made metaphysical naturalism attractive. Moreover, nearly  all of the scientific sociologists in America during the discipline’s establishment  “were personally hostile to religion per se,” writes contemporary sociologist  Christian Smith. “These were skeptical Enlightenment atheologians, personally  devoted apostles of secularization.”60 </page> <page sequence="18"> Academic Analysts of the Relationship    61 The motivation for promoting metaphysical naturalism was a combination  of the personal anti-religiosity of the founders and the need to draw very strong  intellectual boundaries against the competing group of religious social gospel  sociologists. By delegitimating religious belief writ large, this latter faction could  be convincingly defeated and sociology could be a “science,” given that natural  scientists, with their naturalistic assumptions, controlled what was considered to  be legitimate knowledge in universities. In his examination of sociology textbooks published from the 1880s through  the 1920s, Christian Smith concludes that they were devoted to the idea that reli- gious knowledge-claims were false. In the words of a nineteenth-century textbook  writer, emphasizing that religion is about knowledge claims about nature, “All . . .  phenomena are now satisfactorily explained on strictly natural principles. Among  people acquainted with science, all . . . supernatural beings have been dispensed  with, and the belief in them is declared to be wholly false and to have always been  false.” Echoing Comte, another textbook states that religion is the anthropomor- phic projection of “savages,” and that this projection constitutes “the basis of all  religious ideas.” Smith concludes that the textbooks claim that “religion is con- cerned with the spiritual realm, which is beyond sociology’s ability to examine,  but . . . all religions are finally reducible to naturalistic, material, and social causes,  and are clearly false in their claims.”61 In sum, while metaphysical naturalism is not dominant in the natural sciences,  the European social scientists such as Comte advocated for metaphysical natural- ism, and this was adopted by American social science. Later European theorists  like Marx, Weber and Durkheim reinforced this vision. American social science  was born with methodological naturalism in its DNA, and sociology was born  with a commitment to advocating metaphysical naturalism as well. Committed to showing that religious beliefs are false, sociologists saw religion  as about knowledge about the world, and therefore any conflict with science must  be about knowledge. Moreover, it was not just a few religious beliefs that were  false, but the entire religious system of knowledge, further encouraging soci- ologists to see systemic knowledge conflict. Of course, most sociologists are not  consciously engaged in promoting metaphysical naturalism or cognizant of the  systemic knowledge assumptions embedded in classic sociological theory. Rather,  when needing to go beyond their data, they must turn to theoretical assumptions  to complete their claims, and they turn to theories which assume systemic knowl- edge conflict. C ONCLUSION In the previous chapter I showed that the elite scientists and the theologians—the  advocates—are having a debate about systemic knowledge conflict. In this chapter  </page> <page sequence="19"> 62    Chapter Three I showed that the academics who are observing or analyzing the conflict between  science and religion also see systemic knowledge conflict. Historians primar- ily examine elites from the past, so it is not surprising that they have primarily  observed systemic knowledge conflict. This could be because they inevitably study  elites, or because religion and science in the past were engaged in systemic knowl- edge conflict. We might expect that sociologists, who do study the public, would not portray  the religion and science relationship as one of systemic knowledge conflict. What  we find is that theories that originated a hundred or more years ago, but are still  influential to this day, promote the idea that any relationship concern systemic  knowledge. These have left a legacy of difficulty in seeing anything but knowledge  conflict. Elites in the literatures portrayed in the past two chapters are portrayed as reso- lutely concerned about knowledge conflict. However, the historians are studying  debates of more than fifty years ago, and the sociological theories I reviewed are  similarly aged. If we look at elite debates of the past fifty years, we will see a pre- sentation of religion and science that does not imply conflict over knowledge, a  transformation that has not been recognized. I turn to this examination in the  next chapter. </page> </plain_text>
