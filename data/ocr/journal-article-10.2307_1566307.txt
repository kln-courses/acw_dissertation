<plain_text><page sequence="1">GIORGIO AGAMBEN AND THE POLITICS OF THE LIVING DEAD ANDREW NORRIS Death is most frightening, since it is a boundary. -Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics And as the same thing there exists in us living and dead and the waking and the sleeping and young and old: for these things having changed round are those, and those having changed round are these. -Heraclitus, Fragment 88 What is politics today? What is its relationship to the tradition from which it emerges? The questions are difficult ones to answer in part because contemporary politics seems so schizophrenic. In affluent Western countries politics is increasingly a matter of spec- tacle on the one hand and managed economies on the other. Hannah Arendt seems quite confirmed in her claim that the once-glorious public realm of appearance is fundamen- tally degraded when it is overrun by concerns more appropriate to the private realm, such as household management and gossip. If this "unnatural growth of the natural" [47] inclines us to nostalgia for a time when the two realms were more decisively sepa- rated, such nostalgia is likely intensified by the "ethnic cleansing," rape camps, and genocide that we now associate with names such as "Yugoslavia" and "Rwanda." But as improbable as any flight to the past may be, it is even less likely that the politics of that past could help us navigate the treacherous waters of our current technological society. I have in mind not only the familiar claim that the attempted genocides of our time are only made possible by quite modem forms of technology, organization, and experience,' but also recent scientific and "medical" advances. Consider just two: first, the corporate driven and controlled development of biotechnologies, in which huge multinationals are acquiring patents to genetic "information" such as "all human blood cells that have come from the umbilical cord of [any] newborn child." If there is any doubt that such developments will lead us to redefine the human being, these may be laid to rest by the case of John Moore, an Alaskan businessman who found his own body parts had been patented, without his knowledge, by the University of California at Los Angeles and licensed to the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation [Rifkin 60-61]. So much for Locke's attempt to ground the institution of private property in the fact that "every Man has a Property in his own Person"!2 In its place we seem to be moving I am grateful to Giorgio Agamben, Joe Campisi, Bill Connolly, Tom Rockmore, Hans Sluga, and Eric Wilson for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this essay. I would also like to thank Yasemin Ok for her help. 1. For an excellent discussion of this, see Baumanl2-30. 2. Locke, Two Treatises of Government 2: 27. There is, however, no necessary contradiction 38 diacritics 30.4: 38-58</page><page sequence="2">toward something more like the "logical synthesis of biology and economy" called for by the National Socialist Institut allemand in Paris in 1942 [Agamben, Homo Sacer 145]. A similar process of redefinition is already underway in the field of death, a phe- nomenon that scientists and lawyers are having a harder and harder time pinning down. Where once death was defined by the cessation of the movement of the heart and lungs, recent life support technologies have forced scientists to define death in terms of such technologies. Witness Doctor Norman Shumway's defense of the definition of death as brain death: "I'm saying that anyone whose brain is dead is dead. It is the one determi- nant that would be universally applicable, because the brain is the one organ that can't be transplanted" [ 163]. By implication, if and when technology is developed that allows for brain transplants, even those whose brains are "dead" will be brought back to some kind of life, perhaps as organ farms for others who are less ambiguously alive. Giorgio Agamben, from whose book Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life I take both this last grisly example and its analysis, argues that, contrary to appearances, such developments do not represent a radical break with the tradition. His analysis both builds upon and corrects Michel Foucault's claim that politics in our time is constituted by disciplines of normalization and subjectification that Foucault labels "bio-power." For Foucault, biopower is fundamentally modem. "What might be called a society's 'threshold of modernity,"' he writes, "has been reached when the life of the species is wagered on its own political strategies. For millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living animal with the additional capacity for political existence; modem man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question" [143]. This passage seems to imply not only that modernity is political in a different way than the previous millennia had been, but that it is more political, even essentially so. If politics was an "additional capacity" with Aristotle, now politics is of our essence, and life has become its object. Agamben echoes such claims at times, and argues, for instance, that "the politicization of bare life as such . . . constitutes the decisive event of modernity and signals a radical transformation of the political-philosophical categories of ancient thought" [4]. But he also maintains that this transformation is made possible by the metaphysics of those very ancient categories. As in Nietzsche's discussion of nihilism, on Agamben's analysis, biopolitics fulfills the potential of its origin in turning against that origin.3 Hence, Agamben argues against Foucault that life in some sense always has been the definitive object of politics. His argument begins with a review of Aristotle's distinction, in the first book of Politics, between bare life (to zen) and the good life (to eu zen): "we may say that while [the polis] grows for the sake of mere life, it exists for the sake of a good life" [1.2.8]. Agamben rightly argues that this distinction has served here, as Locke also maintains that our bodies belong to God, and that our tacit consent to the institution of money takes us beyond the limitations of the initial form of private property [2: 6, 36, 50]. Not completely so, of course; and a defender of UCLA, the Sandoz corporation, or the proponents of organ farming might look for support to Locke's spoilage limitation: "As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils; so much may he by his labourfix a Property in. ... Nothing was made by Godfor Man to spoil or destroy " [2: 31]. One can object on a number of grounds to ghoulish proposals to develop "neomorts," bodies that, still "warm, pulsating, and urinating" are neither dead nor alive, and hence beyond the purview of rights that might protect us (?)from being turned into organ farms; but one can hardly cite a lack of either industriousness or a desire to make use of all that God has given us. 3. It may take centuries for a people to experience the disgust with life that initially made them a people: the exhaustion of Europe (the death of God) is a contemporary event, albeit one that has been in genesis for two thousand years. "The time has come when we have to pay for having been Christians for two thousand years: we are losing the center of gravity by virtue of which we lived; we are lost for a while" [Nietzsche, Will to Power 20]. diacritics / winter 2000 39</page><page sequence="3">as the foundation of the Western tradition of political philosophy, in that politics has been distinguished from essentially private enterprises on the grounds that it is con- cerned with something more than the perpetuation of biological life. Because the end of politics is different from that of the various realms of bare life, such as family life, slave holding, and village association, its principle of order is different as well. For Aristotle the "something more" that distinguishes the political is the realization of the human capacity to structure a just common life in the community's noncoercive, deliberative reflection upon the question of what justice is and what concrete measures it entails: "Justice belongs to the polis; for justice, which is the determination of what is just, is an ordering of the political association" [Politics 1.2.66]. For all of their disagreements, the vast majority of contemporary political philosophers are united in their commitment to this self-reflexive project, and to its identification of the political and the just.4 Agamben, however, suggests that this politico-philosophical project today stands with- out the foundations that Aristotle proposed for it, namely the categorical distinction between bare life and the good or political life. And this is not because an element foreign to Aristotle's schema has polluted or subverted it, but because the schema has deconstructed itself.5 What is the instability here that would allow for this? When we read the first book of Politics it appears that Aristotle is laying out a chronological account of the rise of the polis. Human beings began living in families, then they acquired slaves and formed villages, until finally they achieved a self-sufficient (autarkes) mode of life. But to treat this as nothing more than a history is to misunderstand the nature of the boundary that human beings cross when their community becomes self-sufficient, and to assume, as Foucault does in the passage cited above, that political life can be simply added on to human life. Aristotle, however, expressly denies this: "The man who is isolated-who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or has no need because he is already self-sufficient-is no part of the polis, and must therefore be either a beast or a god."6 To be truly human one must be a member of apolis, for it is only as such that one can truly speak: "The mere making of sounds serves to indicate pleasure and pain, and is thus a faculty that belongs to animals in general. ... But language serves to ... declare what is just and unjust" [Politics 1.2.16]. This conception of the human life as not sim- 4. This may seem to contradict the Arendtian claim-which Agamben accepts-that "Soci- ety is the form in which the fact of mutual dependence for the sake of life and nothing else as- sumes public significance and where the activities connected with sheer survival are permitted to appear in public" [Human Condition 46]. However, accepting as fundamental the distinction between the good life and mere life has hardly precluded liberal political philosophy from turning back and subordinating the public realm to the interests of the private-a subordination that redefines but does not entirely eliminate the categorical distinction between the two. It is simply that in liberalism the "good life" is increasingly a procedural matter, one that most efficiently regulates the conflicts between our discrete private lives. The debate between Michael Sandel and John Rawls, for instance, is not over the relevance of the Aristotelian distinction, but over the definition and preconditions ofjustice. Hence each party to the debate understands himself to be contributing to the Aristotelian project. Compare Sandel 317ff and Rawls 424ff 5. Agamben distinguishes his analysis from a deconstructive one, apparently (the discussion is uncharacteristically unclear) on the grounds that deconstruction allows itself to become en- tangled with paradoxes in an unhelpful way [54]. Be that as it may, I am using the term quite loosely here to refer to a mode of analysis that finds the assertions it treats to require a logical structure (of say, binary oppositions such as logic and rhetoric, performative and constative language, inner and outer political life and bare life) that they themselves unravel. 6. Politics 1.2.14. If this statement-which, surprisingly, Agamben does not cite-strikes us as hyperbolic, we need only recall the more general point that Book 10 of Nicomachean Ethics ends with a call for the Politics because the particularly human arete can only be realized within a political life. 40</page><page sequence="4">ply a given but an achievement is definitive of the notion of human culture. Most of us tend, however, to consider only the good and just life to which we aspire. Agamben in contrast focuses on the life that fails to achieve humanity; the remains, as it were, of our becoming moral, just, and political. I say "as it were," because "mere life" cannot truly be exuviated. It too is human life, though perhaps not fully so. In his discussion of Aristotle's Politics Agamben argues that Politics ... appears as the truly fundamental structure [struttura] of Western metaphysics insofar as it occupies the threshold [soglia] on which the relation between the living being and the logos is realized [si compie]. In the "politicization" of bare life-the metaphysical task par excellence-the hu- manity of living man is decided [si decide]. ... There is politics because man is the living being who, in language, separates and opposes himself to his own bare life [nuda vita] and, at the same time, maintains himself in relation to that bare life in an inclusive exclusion [un' esclusione inclusiva]. [8]7 "Threshold" is a word that occurs again and again in Agamben's text, and it invariably signifies a passage that cannot be completed, a distinction that can be neither main- tained nor eliminated.8 The fundamental political distinction between bare life and the good, just life lived in accordance with the logos proposes humanity as a project, one of self-overcoming. But this project, as such, relies upon "the exclusion (which is simulta- neously an inclusion) of bare life [una esclusione (che e, nella stessa misura, un'im- plicazione) della nuda vita]" [7]. Bare life is a necessary part of the good life, in that the good life is both what bare life is not and what bare life becomes, "as if politics were the place in which life had to transform itself into good life and in which what had to be politicized were always already bare life" [7]. This is not a dialectic between two com- parable moments of the human, for it is only political life that is truly lived in language, that can truly speak. Bare life is mute, undifferentiated, and stripped of both the gener- ality and the specificity that language makes possible. If it is related and compared and evaluated, that is always in the terms and in the service of what it is not: political life. But since political life defines itself in terms of its genesis from and its nonidentity with bare life, political life is defined by its relation with the nonrelational.9 "Exteriority ... 7. On politics as metaphysics, compare 44 ff., 182, and the discussion of Heidegger and Levinas at 150-53. 8. Homo Sacer is divided into three parts, with an additional introduction. The first is de- voted to the nature of sovereignty, the second to that of the Homo Sacer of the title, and the third to "the Camp as Biopolitical Paradigm of the Modern. " Each of these ends with a section entitled "Threshold" (Soglia). Agamben does not announce this, but I believe the word is derived from and meant to refer back to these lines, which are found in the first "Threshold": "In the words of Benveniste, to render the victim sacred, it is necessary 'to separate itfrom the world of the living, it is necessary to cross the threshold that separates the two universes: this is the aim of the killing'" [66]. If this is so, each part of the book ends in the "no-man's-land" [159] between life and death. Each therefore serves as a different path to the same goal, that of the confusion of politics and life. Compare this conception of the threshold with Jean-Luc Nancy's discussion of Caravaggio 's Death of the Virgin in his essay "On the Threshold": "Death: we are never there, we are always there. Inside and outside, at once" [115]. 9. Compare 24 ("The sovereign exception is thus the figure in which singularity is repre- sented as such, which is to say, insofar as it is unrepresentable"), 29 ("the simple positing of relation with the nonrelational"), 60 ("the relationship of abandonment is not a relation"), and 110 ("The ban is essentially ... the power of maintaining itself in relation to something presup- posed as nonrelational"). diacritics / winter 2000 41</page><page sequence="5">is truly the innermost center of the political system, and the political system lives off it" [36]. This account of the paradoxical inclusive exclusion of bare life in the metaphysics of politics can be seen as a more radical version of Arendt's paradoxical claim in The Origins of Totalitarianism that "a man who is nothing but a man has lost the very quali- ties which make it possible for other people to treat him as a man" [300]. Similarly, Agamben's more radical account of the logic at work here has obvious affinities with and debts to Hegel's analysis of the law of identity as a self-contradictory principle that, as such, proves to be a law of contradiction: those who assert the principle "A = A... do not see that in this very assertion they are themselves saying that identity is different; for they are saying that identity is different from difference; since this must at the same time be admitted to be the nature of identity, their assertion implies that identity, not exter- nally, but in its own self, in its very nature, is this, to be different" [Hegel 413]. The resulting concept of negation is for Hegel the engine of history, and as such it allows him to reconcile his claim that history progresses with the evident fact that the most glorious and praiseworthy empires are inevitably ground under in the course of that progress. Negation as the dialectical and historical movement of Reason thereby ulti- mately produces or reveals itself to be a harmonious, rational totality. In contrast, on Agamben's account, the Aufhebung of politics is never achieved: bare life and political life are never reconciled, and political life's every attempt-the attempt that defines political life-to mediate its own relationship with the life that it is not fails in the end. More significant than the differences between Agamben and Hegel is the fact that for both it is the movement through negation that is essential, not the fiction of a static result. Hence, on Agamben's account, politics must again and again enact its internal distinction from bare life. It must repeatedly define itself through the negation of bare life-a negation that can always take the form of death.'1 The analysis of the metaphysical movement of the living being "into" language that undergirds these claims has been an ongoing concern of Agamben's." His earlier Language and Death: The Place of Negativity investigates the metaphysical connection between human mortality and the human capacity for language particularly as it is de- lineated in Heidegger and Hegel. Agamben begins the book by citing the former's claim (from On the Way to Language) that "Mortals are they who can experience death as death. Animals cannot do so. But animals cannot speak either. The essential relation between death and language flashes before us, but remains unthought" [xi]. He goes on to try to "think" this relation through a consideration of the originary nature of negativ- ity in Heidegger's thought of Da-sein and Hegel's thought of the Diese, and argues that "both the 'faculty' for language and the 'faculty' for death, inasmuch as they open for humanity the most proper dwelling place [la sua dimora pia propria], reveal and dis- close this same dwelling place as always already permeated by and founded in negativ- ity" [xii]. There is, Agamben argues, a structural parallel between the ambiguous place of death within the human life and the place of indication within language. Each serves as a limit or threshold which one can place neither within nor without the life or system 10. Indeed, on Hegel's account it must: "nicht das Leben, das sich vor dem Tode scheunt und vor der Verwiistung rein bewahrt, sondern das ihn ertaigt und in ihm sich erhdilt, ist das Leben des Geistes" [qtd. in Schnaidelbach 46]. 11. In an earlier work Agamben writes of "an unwritten book" on this theme, The Human Voice, of which his written works after 1977 serve as the prologue and afterwords. In this unwrit- ten work there are "numerous drafts" transcribing the passage in Politics where Aristotle bases man's political nature upon his ability to speak ofjustice and injustice [see Agamben, Infancy and History 3 and 7-8]. 42</page><page sequence="6">that it defines. Death is something like an ostensive definition with which one seeks to pick out the nonlinguistic reality that language discusses and that makes language mean- ingful. Just as "the limit of language always falls within language" such that it "is al- ways contained within as a negative," so death both is and is not "an event of life."'2 Because of this structural parallel, death assumes a privileged place in the logic of the "meaning" of human life. As in the passage cited from Heidegger above, and as in Heidegger's early insistence that the authentic or proper response to human mortality entails heeding the silent call of conscience, death shows what language can never say, and in so doing serves as the revelation of the negative ground of the human.'3 We might say that death becomes beautiful. The two moments of the "speaking animal" are thereby cast into an endless struggle: "from the dawn of Greek thought, the human experience of language (that is, the experience of the human as both living and speaking, a natural and a logical being) has appeared in the tragic spectacle divided by an unresolvable conflict." The form this conflict takes is that of the sacrificial violence that serves as the ungrounded ground of all praxis [Language and Death 58-62, 88, 105-06]. Homo Sacer advances this analysis in at least two ways: in its reflections upon the kind of "life" that is involved in this process, and in its consideration of the distinctively political aspect of this movement. In Language and Death the metaphysical movement into a relationship with the logos does not essentially involve the living body, nor does Agamben spend much time drawing out the implications of this metaphysics for the body.14 The names Foucault, Arendt, and Schmitt--each of which figure prominently in Homo Sacer-do not appear, and when Agamben does speak of the practical implica- tions of metaphysics (that "which enacts [compie] the experience [1'esperienza] merely shown [mostrare] by logic" [Language and Death 88] he speaks of "ethics" repeatedly, and only two or three times of "politics."'5 Nonetheless, the development and extension of the analysis does not alter its fundamental structure. 12. Language and Death 17 and Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 6.4311. Both here and in his appendix to The Coming Community, Agamben is influenced by the early Wittgenstein's understanding of the mystical status of ethics and his related insistence that the ability to say (sagen) things in language rests upon language's ability to show (zeichen) things. As David Pears puts it, "language cannot contain an analysis of the conditions of its own applica- tion " [11]. 13. "And to what is one summoned? To one's own self. .... The call is lacking any kind of utterance. It does not even come to words, and yet is not at all obscure and indefinite. Conscience speaks solely and constantly in the mode of silence" [Heidegger Being and Time 252; cf Lan- guage and Death 54-62]. 14. See Language and Death: "Metaphysics is not simply that thought that thinks the experi- ence of language on the basis of an (animal) voice, but rather, it always already thinks this expe- rience on the basis of the negative dimension of a Voice" [61]. 1 should note that this statement is phrased as a conditional. However the context makes it clear that it is Agamben's considered view, as it is on this basis that he concludes that Heidegger fails in the end to escape metaphys- ics-a conclusion that is hardly insignificant, providing as it does the justification for much of Agamben's own attempt to move beyond Heidegger That said, it remains true that his attempt to do this is in many ways a working out of the problem of the place of the animal in fundamental ontology and the critique of metaphysics, a problem that is laid out in admirable detail by Derrida in the sixth chapter of his Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question. 15. See Language and Death 86-88, 91. This distinction, while significant, should not be exaggerated, given Agamben's commitment to the Heideggerian interpretation of "ethos" as nam- ing "the abode of man" rather than the individual's character or habit. Compare Language and Death 93 and Heidegger "Letter on Humanism" 258. For evidence that Agamben's conception of the ethical nonetheless retains familiar connotations of privacy as opposed to the publicity of the political, see Language and Death 107. diacritics / winter 2000 43</page><page sequence="7">The terms of this discussion make plain Agamben's debt to Heidegger. In so doing, they open his analysis to the threat of quiet dismissal by political theorists, many of whom are wearied by the abstractness and the density of this language. In this regard it is crucial to note how well Agamben's analysis accounts for otherwise obscure features of canonical texts that he himself ignores. We might begin by comparing the passages from Aristotle upon which Agamben focuses with Socrates's strikingly similar claim in the Crito that "the really important thing is not to live, but to live well." This claim is in fact the central move in Socrates's justification of his active participation in his own execution. He in other words enacts the sacrifice of bare life that the prioritization of the good life entails. Aristotle's use of this formulation to describe a political life that is meant to endure on both the level of biology and virtue is obviously more problem- atic-a fact that may go some way toward explaining Aristotle's own celebration of the kalos death. Nor is this the only such moment in the Platonic corpus. We might consider as well the second book of Plato's Republic: this gives us as clear a picture of politics as the metaphysical movement described by Agamben as any other, generating as it does a just city from the inadequacies of Adeimantus's "city in speech," a city whose exclusive focus upon the satisfaction of bodily need prohibits Socrates and his companions from discerning the nature and origin of justice. In the first book of the Republic justice is tentatively associated with trade and with interstate conflict [332e, 333a]. Trade is present in Adeimantus's city, as is at least the abstract possibility of war [372b], and so one might assume that justice will be as well. Yet Socrates hesitates to say this. When he asks "where ... would justice and injustice be" [371e] in such a city, Adeimantus re- plies, "'I can't think, Socrates,... unless it's somewhere in some need these men have of one another" [372a]. Though this sounds very much like the picture we ultimately get, in which justice is a matter of the internal structure of the city, where each person does his own, proper task, and each particular finds its meaning and its satisfaction in the balanced whole, Socrates hardly embraces Adeimantus's tentative, initial formula- tion with enthusiasm. "'Perhaps what you say is fine,"' he replies. "'It must really be considered and we mustn't back away"' [372a]. The considerations that follow, how- ever, are entirely circumscribed by the guiding assumptions of the city's founder con- cerning need and satisfaction, and they produce nothing more than an almost comically banal list of the material arrangements of the city, its procreation and its production and consumption of "bread, wine, clothing, and shoes" [372a]. It is at this point that Glaucon loses patience and objects that this is no human city at all. When Socrates takes up Glaucon's suggestion that they must consider a city that is driven by the desire to satisfy more than the needs of mere life, he notes that "in considering such a city ... we could probably see in what way justice and injustice naturally grow in cities" [372e]. Why have they not been able to do so up to now? Why does Socrates imply that Adeimantus's answer was inaccurate, because they were not in a position to answer the question of justice? The answer is that he has silently accepted Glaucon's criticisms of the city of mere life. This acceptance is implied when Socrates says of pigs: "'This animal wasn't in our earlier city-there was no need-but in this one there will be need of it in addition"' [373c]. For Socrates to say this of the city Glaucon has moments before termed "a city of sows" would appear to be an ironic confirmation of Glaucon's objection: it is unlikely that Socrates believes pork to be necessary to the feverish life of luxury. It is more likely that he says pigs were unneces- sary in the "healthy" city because, as Glaucon claims, the citizens themselves were pigs. This silent agreement leads Socrates to help in the constitution of Glaucon's "fe- verish" city, where the aspiration to satisfy more than the needs of life will require the sacrifice of life in war. It is this city which ultimately issues forth the just city which, as 44</page><page sequence="8">a just city, literally breeds its inhabitants--that is to say, a city that self-consciously reenacts the genesis of the just life from bare life. Indeed, Socrates calls for more than simple breeding: the political "art of judging" is in fact made possible by an "art of medicine," the practice of which involves that the doctor "let die the ones whose bodies are [corrupt], and the ones whose souls have bad natures and are incurable, they them- selves will kill" [409e-410]. Socrates here openly accepts that his biopolitics must at the same time be a thanatopolitics. Here, perhaps more clearly than in the few lines from Aristotle upon which Agamben focuses, we can see that Arendt is both exactly right and exactly wrong when she argues that "politics is never for the sake of life."16 It is the movement from bare life to political life that defines both bare life and political life." Politics thus entails the constant negotiation of the threshold between itself and the bare life that is both included within and excluded from its body. But such a threshold is hopelessly unstable, as is signaled by the fact that politics is both the passage from bare life to itself and what lies beyond this passage."1 The titles of the 16. The Human Condition 37. For a more contemporary example of the relevance of Agamben's analysis, consider William Connolly's claim that "Identity requires difference in or- der to be, and it converts difference into otherness in order to secure its own self-certainty." On the face of it it would appear that Connolly's analysis of the paradoxes of political identity is limited to a discussion of our need to distinguish ourselves from other individuals and groups without reifying that distinction by claiming that the other is so different as to be inferior or threatening. Connolly however has reminded me that his analysis here of self and other is open to a third element, that of life: "There is more in my life than any official definition of identity can express. I am not exhausted by my identity." Significantly this greater me is not me: "this abun- dance is in me but is neither me nor mine"; hence it "can help me to recognize and attend to the claims of the other in myself " On the face of it the structure of this paradox would appear to exactly replicate that ofAgamben's bare life, which both is and is not a moment of the life of the polis. We must then ask whether the acknowledgment of a life that "I" live but that is not "mine" can avoid the metaphysical quandaries ofAgamben 's analysis [see Connolly 64, 120]. 17. Agamben begins by identifying bare life with zoe, "the simple fact of living common to all living beings, " as opposed to bios, "which [in ancient Greek] indicated the form or way of living proper to an individual or a group" [1, 4]. But in the passage from Aristotle's Politics upon which he places such importance, the distinction between bare life and political life is between two variants of zoe. Moreover, on 88 "simple natural life" ("la semplice vita naturale") is con- trasted with "life exposed to death (bare or sacred life) " ("la vita esposta alla morte [la nuda vita o vita sacra]"). Presumably this is because simple natural life is not in itself in relation with political life, and sacred life is defined by precisely that relationship. This is corroborated by Agamben 's assertion on 90 that sacred life is "neither political bios nor natural zoe" but rather "the zone of indistinction in which zoe and bios constitute each other in including and excluding each other" [and see 106, 109]. If we take this process as the metaphysical movement of politics, this seems to come closest to Agamben 's considered view; but it is clearly incompatible with the claims made earlier in the book. It is also unclear how consistent it is with Agamben 's suggestions that his bare life is or can be a form of "pure life" ("pura vita") [171]. Nonetheless, many of the confusions that seem to plague Agamben's use of the term "bare life" are only superficial: on 114-15, for instance, he writes that "Sacredness is a line of flight still present in contemporary politics, a line that is moving into zones increasingly vast and dark, to the point of ultimately coinciding with the biological life [vita biologica] of the citizens." This might appear to repeat the same contradiction to which I have just pointed; but this appearance is deceiving: it is be- cause biopolitics in the form of sacred life defines both bare life and political life that these definitions can change, and even, as in modernity, collapse into one another 18. The instability of the distinction between political and apolitical life may already be signaled in Aristotle's text: This entire discussion is an explication and defense of his claim that, pace Plato 's Statesman, "It is a mistake to believe that the 'statesman' is the same as the monarch of a kingdom, or the manager of a household, or the master of a number of slaves" [1.1.2]. The order of the family is not "the determination of what is just" but the rule of the father and hus- diacritics / winter 2000 45</page><page sequence="9">three parts of Agamben's book mark the different moments of its unraveling: "The Logic of Sovereignty," "Homo Sacer," and "The Camp as Biopolitical Paradigm of the Mod- em." With the rise of sovereignty we witness the constitution of a political authority that corresponds to the ambiguities of this threshold more closely then did the polis. Sover- eignty, on this account, is not simply a moment of the rise of the nation-state, but instead an expression of the inner dynamics of the logic of politics. Agamben here follows Carl Schmitt's analysis of the sovereign as "he who decides on the exception" [5].19 As Agamben notes, the word "exception" (l'eccezione or die Aus-nahme), "according to its etymological root" refers to what is "taken outside (ex-capere), and not simply excluded" [18]. The sovereign, in other words, has the legal authority to decide who shall be re- moved from the purview of law, as in a state of martial law or the Schmittian state of emergency. Sovereignty is the law's threshold with the nonlegal; as Schmitt writes, it is "a borderline concept . .. one pertaining to the outermost sphere" [5].20 It is the point at which the law enters into relation with that which has no legal standing. In identifying the threshold between the legal and the nonlegal, sovereignty defines them both. This is perhaps clearer in Schmitt's text than in Agamben's. "There is," Schmitt writes, "no norm applicable to chaos. For a legal order to make sense, a normal situation must exist, and he is sovereign who definitively decides whether this normal situation exists" [13]. A state of emergency is the product of the collapse of the normal order; but the normal order is only the absence of a state of emergency.21 Agamben's gloss on this is that The exception [1'eccezione] does not subtract itself from the rule [regola]; rather, the rule, suspending itself, gives rise to the exception and, maintaining itself in relation to the exception, first constitutes itself as a rule. . . . The sovereign decision [La decisione sovrana] of the exception is the orginary juridico-political structure [struttura] on the basis of which what is included in the juridical order and what is excluded from it acquire their meaning. [ 18- 19]. He concludes from this that "What emerges in the limit figure [figura-limite] is the radical crisis of every possibility of clearly distinguishing between membership and inclusion, between what is outside and what is inside, between exception and rule" [25]. Once the rule acknowledges that it gives rise to exceptions for which it cannot legislate, every case can, in principle, be understood in these terms. The only way to avoid this band, who is analogous to a slave-owner and a monarch. In all three cases, domination, not deliberation, is the ordering principle, just as the end is not the good life, but the perpetuation of life. However in the face of all of this Aristotle asserts that our perceptions of good and evil and just and unjust make up both "a family and a polis" [1.2.12]. 19. It might be better to say that Agamben here appropriates Schmitt, for it is certainly true that his borrowings from Heidegger Hegel, Schmitt, et al. pursue a common theme that is defined more by Agamben than by his sources. 20. For a very similar discussion (albeit one conducted on a less metaphysical plane) of the rise of sovereignty, see Bartelson. Here, as in Agamben's discussion, the rise of sovereignty en- tails the destabilization of "the very divide that previously separated the inside of republican politics from its more anarchic outside, " a destabilization in which "whatformerly was relegated to the outside now moves into the very center of political action and understanding" [330-31; compare Homo Sacer 35-36]. 21. It should be clear that this does not necessarily repeat Bodin 's claim that sovereignty is the source of law, where law is defined as command. The source of the law need not be the sovereign; but if the sovereign does decide on the exception, then, in so doing, it decides on the norm as well [see Bodin 38, 51]. 46</page><page sequence="10">conclusion is to argue that, even in those cases where the rule cannot legislate, it still does legislate in some impoverished sense. One would have to argue, that is, that excep- tional cases are clearly defined as such by the rule. But this is in effect to deny the reality of the exception and the need of the legal order for a sovereign decision upon it. With the rise of sovereignty we witness the rise of a form of life that corresponds to it. "The sovereign sphere [sfera] is the sphere in which it is permitted to kill without committing homicide and without celebrating a sacrifice [sacrificio], and sacred life [sacra]-that is, life that may be killed but not sacrificed-is the life that has been captured in this sphere" [83]. Agamben does not define the sacred in terms of "what is set apart for worship of the deity." He is interested in the more fundamental question of the logic of sacrifice (from Latin sacrificium, from sacr-, sacer, holy, cursed) as re- vealed in the life that is sacred (from Latin sacrare, also from sacr-, sacer). What Agamben terms sacred life is, like the sovereign, both within and without the legal order (or, as its etymology suggests, both holy and cursed). It is inside the legal order insofar as its death can be allowed by that order; but it is outside it insofar as its death can constitute neither a homicide nor a sacrifice. But where sovereignty is a form of power that occupies this threshold, sacred life is nothing more than a life that occupies this threshold, a life that is excluded and included in the political order. Here this takes the form not, as in Aristotle, of a metaphysical puzzle, but rather of a mute helplessness in the face of death. "Sacredness is ... the originary form of the inclusion of bare life [nuda vita] in the judicial order, and the syntagm homo sacer names something like the originary 'political' relation, which is to say, bare life insofar as it operates in an inclu- sive exclusion as the referent of the sovereign decision" [85]. This is the explicit revela- tion of the metaphysical requirement that politics establish a relation with the nonrelational [cf. note 8]. Indeed, the sovereign decision is the realization of the ambi- guity of the distinction between bare and political life. It is law (political life) that is not law (insofar as it steps outside of the strictures and limitations of formal law) dealing with bare life (that is, nonpolitical life), and insofar as it does so that nonpolitical (bare) life it treats is political. The result is the paradox of a sacrifice that is dedicated to no legal or religious end [114] but that participates in and affirms the economy or logic of the legal/religious system as a metaphysical, political system. Where in Ren6 Girard's superficially similar account of sacrifice the victim is a scapegoat for the murderous desires of the community that unites around her, here the stakes are considerably higher. Instead of an act of self-protection on the part of the community [Girard 4, 101-02], sacrifice is the performance of the metaphysical assertion of the human: the Jew, the Gypsy, and the gay man die that the German may affirm his transcendence of his bodily, animal life.22 22. Agamben, I think, complicates his account unnecessarily when he concludes that the killing of bare life does not constitute a sacrifice [114]: the point is that the term "sacrifice" is here understood in a different way, as a move in a different and more fundamental economy, one that produces a transcendence instead of observing one. That said, Agamben's analysis here owes a great deal to Bataille's seminal essay, "Hegel, Death and Sacrifice, " one of the two Bataille texts cited in his bibliography, though only briefly referred to in his text. In this reading ofAlexander Kojeve's reading of Hegel, Bataille argues that the logic of the human practice of sacrifice is revealed in the Hegelian account of the role of death in the constitution of the human. "Death alone assures the existence of a 'spiritual' or 'dialectical' being.... If the animal which consti- tutes man 's natural being did not die, and-what is more-if death did not dwell in him as the source of his anguish-all the more so in that he seeks it out, desires it and sometimes freely chooses it-there would be no man or liberty, no history or individual. In other words, if he revels in what nevertheless frightens him, if he is the being, identical with himself who risks (identical) being itself then man is truly a Man: he separates himselffrom the animal."

Perhaps the clearest example is that of people in camps forc- ibly subjected to extreme medical tests and prisoners who have been condemned to death who are asked to "volunteer" for the same: The particular status of the VPs [Versuchspersonen] was decisive: they were persons sentenced to death or detained in a camp, the entry into which meant the definitive exclusion from the political community. Precisely because they were lacking almost all the rights and expectations that we characteristically attribute to human existence, and yet were still biologically alive [biologicamente ancora vita], they came to be situated at a limit zone [una zona-limite] between life and death, inside and outside, in which they were no longer anything but bare life [nuda vita]. Those who are sentenced to death and those who dwelt in camps are thus in some way unconsciously assimilated to homines sacres, to a life that may be killed without the commission of homi- cide. Like the fence of the camp, the interval between death sentence and ex- tion of the life of the animal body alone is not sufficient. As in Agamben's reading of Aristotle, language too is necessary. On Bataille's account this is because "language ... alone founds the separation of elements and by founding it founds itself on it, within a world of separated and denominated entities." The death of the animal life that is required for the emergence of the human being is a death that no purely animal life could ever die. The animal, on Bataille's ac- count, is lost in the sea of life. If it ceases to live, it is replaced by another of its kind, another that does not differ essentially from it. In effect, it remains present. "The only true death supposes separation and, through the discourse which separates, the consciousness of being separated." Hence, if death is required in order for the human being to separate itselffrom its animal being, to some extent that separation must already have taken place in language. Death is not truly death-that is, it is not or does not allow for the metaphysical overcoming of the animal-unless it is the death of a human being. (It is in this context that Bataille cites Kojeve 's "bizarre" and perfectly apt saying, that man is "'the anthropomorphic animal.'") The circularity here is pre- cisely that ofAgamben 's bare life: bare life is what is not political, what the political life exuviates: and yet for it to perform this function it must in some sense be political already. Bataille is well aware of the paradoxes this entails: "In theory, it is his natural, animal being whose death re- veals Man to himself but the revelation never takes place. For when the animal being supporting him dies, the human being himself ceases to be. In order for Man to reveal himself ultimately to himself he would have to die, but he would have to do it while living-watching himself ceasing to be " [Bataille 12, 15-16, 19-20]. For Bataille if not for Hegel, the solution to this is sacrifice and "the necessity of spectacle ": the explanation for the almost universal practice of sacrifice is that human beings do in fact need to undergo this sublation; and their solution to the above paradox is to kill an animal whose physical life stands in for their own. If we disregard Bataille's emphasis upon religious ritual it is clear that he is describing the same Aufhebung that Agamben attributes to Aristotle-the difference being that Hegel and Bataille 's references to death explic- itly commit them to a process that endangers and rejects bare life. Why then doesn't Agamben discuss the Bataille article-why turn to Aristotle instead? In his few comments on Bataille in this book, he suggests that Bataille 's analysis of sovereignty is compromised by its insistence upon the erotic nature of sacrifice [113] and by its too-ready acceptance of the early twentieth-century anthropological reading of the sacred [75]. One result of this is that Bataille is not able to think out the specifically political nature of the logic of sacrifice he uncovers. To locate the genesis of that logic in Aristotle's Politics would make good this lack. This is something that Bataille is unable to do in part because he assumes that the logic of sacrifice and death is alien to Greek philosophy as a whole: "for Hegel, the human reality which he places at the heart, and center of the totality is very different from that of Greek philosophy. His anthropology is that of the Judeo- Christian tradition" [12], for which the figure of Christ on the cross serves as the model of all transcendence of the bestial. diacritics / winter 2000 49</page><page sequence="13">ecution delimits an extratemporal and extraterritorial threshold [soglia] in which the human body is separated from its normal [normale] political status and abandoned, in a state of exception [in stato di eccezione], to the most extreme misfortunes. [ 159] When, in the United States, men condemned to death have been offered the possibility of parole in exchange for "volunteering" to undergo tests that could not be imposed upon those with full rights of citizenship [156-57], the reasoning was quite understand- able, and even attractive in its economy and "fairness": given that the person has been condemned to die, he has essentially already lost his life. As far as the law is concerned his life is no longer his own, and in that sense he is a "living dead man" [131]. Hence there will be no crime against him if his life is "lost" again. But neither will that death be the imposition of the death penalty. Indeed, it is precisely insofar as he awaits execution that he remains alive: his life remains only to be taken from him in the moment of punishment. Death in the experiment thus reveals the paradoxes of death row as a sphere that delayed penalty makes possible, that of the threshold between life and death.23 When the threshold of death row holds more than one or two victims, the result is the camp. Historically developing out of martial law, it is itself an included exclusion from the penal system [20, 166-67]. If the Aristotelian distinction between polis life and bare life with which we began was meant to secure and define the human, the total politicization of life that is the camp signals the collapse of this project. Agamben's characterization can be understood as an attempt to more systematically work out Arendt's paradoxical claim that "life in the concentration camps . . . stands outside of life and death" [Origins of Totalitarianism 444]. Here the exception becomes the norm-or, to be more precise, the distinction between the two is wholly effaced. "The camp is the space [lo spazio] of this absolute impossibility of deciding [decidere] between fact and law, rule and application, exception and rule, which nevertheless incessantly decides [decide] between them" [173]. In the name of the health of the body of the nation, in the attempt to produce a single and undivided people [179], and in response to the decision of the Fiihrer, whose own body has itself become one with the law [184], the nation takes on the endless task of its self-delineation; that is, it moves into the threshold that defines it, a threshold that has awaited it since Aristotle's Politics. 23. Agamben does not mention Antigone, but his discussion of the symbiosis of sovereignty and sacred life is surely reminiscent of this most political of tragedies. The action of the play revolves around a conflict over the city's duties toward a body that is placed neither inside the city nor outside it: the body is of one of the sons of the city, but one who has fought against it, and as a result it lays in the fields outside the city wall, and not in the burial plot that would mark its passage out of this world. There are many ways to characterize Antigone 's criminal refusal to obey Creon, but perhaps the most direct is to say that she tries to sort this confusion out, by burying the body, and hence putting it decisively beyond the city-or, more precisely, acknowl- edging that it always has been beyond or outside of the city, in the sense that it is not within the city's authority to hold it back from burial, and hence from death. If this seems an imposition of themes that are, strictly speaking, foreign to the play, consider its culmination in Creon's sover- eign decision to condemn Antigone to an underground tomb-which perfectly symbolizes Agamben's threshold between life and death. The result is a monstrous confusion of death and life. In the words of the prophet Teiresias: "you have thrust one that belongs above / below the earth, and bitterly dishonored/a living soul by lodging her in the grave; / while one that belonged indeed to the underworld/gods you have kept on this earth without the due share/of rites of burial, of due funeral offerings, / a corpse unhallowed" [Sophocles, Antigone 1136-42]. Creon's edict is a reaffirmation of the city's incorporation of the threshold between life and death: IfAntigone dares to insist that the dead are simply that, and as such beyond politics, Creon will prove her wrong by condemning her to the threshold in which politics and death find one another 50</page><page sequence="14">Now, the mere existence of camps and of Versuchspersonen does not in itself signal the need for as sweeping and fundamental a critique of the tradition as Agamben's. For one might well conclude that what is called for is simply a reassertion of human rights as understood by the tradition; or, to put the point on the explanatory level, that the genocides and rape camps of contemporary politics are conceptually of a piece with the transgressions of James II and other "Beasts of Prey" and "noxious creatures." After all, Agamben himself characterizes the Versuchspersonen in just these terms: it is "pre- cisely because they were lacking almost all the rights and expectations that we charac- teristically attribute to human existence" and yet were still alive that they could "be situated at a limit zone between life and death." On this account the horrors of moder- nity are nothing more than violations of the norms of the tradition-a tradition that simply needs to be reasserted, rather than criticized or deconstructed. And this response might seem sufficient even if one accepts, as Agamben does, Arendt's argument in The Origins of Totalitarianism that the emergence of the camps signals the extreme limita- tions of the politics of human rights. Arendt's argument is that the direct defense of human rights will alone be insufficient. On her account what is needed is rather a recog- nition of the ultimate basis of civil rights-what she terms the "right to have rights."24 This basis Arendt finds in political action. Properly understood, human rights are civil rights: they are based on forms of human action, not a set of moral truths about the laws of God or nature. It is as political, not legal, actors that we are granted rights; and it is through political action that we defend those rights. But in the present case we might interpret this as nothing but a call to indirectly defend human rights, and not at all to question the distinction between political life and bare life upon which the conception of rights rests. Note, though, that as a practical matter this solution has not been particularly effec- tive up to this point. More importantly, it is a conservative one that simply attempts to retreat to a kinder, gentler age. It does not attempt to understand the logic of the camp or the Versuchsperson. These are horrors that invade our political lives and our political thinking from without. This insistence upon the foreign and external nature of these evils is both confirmed and undermined by the suggestions of Tadeusz Borowski or Primo Levi that the camps operated in a sphere beyond good and evil. Consider the effect of reading Borowski's stories, or Levi's invitation "to contemplate the possible meaning in the Lager of the words 'good' and 'evil,' 'just' and 'unjust'; let everybody judge, on the basis of the picture we have just outlined and of the examples given above, how much of our ordinary moral world could survive on this side of the barbed wire" [92].25 On the one hand, we should like to answer that morality and justice mean there just what they mean here, if only with the tempering of a forgiving equity. Anything less feels like collusion with the Nazis, the final denial of the dignity of the camp victim. But if we assert this, we presume to judge the victims of the camps. If morality is not sus- pended in a camp, then the obligation to be just remains just that: an obligation. Moral- ity is not grace. Agamben brings this out nicely in a discussion of Bruno Bettelheim's argument that the Muselmann has passed beyond the limit of the human and the moral by re- nouncing his freedom and by losing sight of the limit beyond which his life would have 24. Origins of Totalitarianism 296. Arendt makes the argument I sketch out here in the last section of the Imperialism volume, "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man. " 25. As readers of Levi know, the title of the first of these volumes, from which I am quoting, is by no means a confident rhetorical question. In a typically American gesture of false confi- dence, If This Is a Man has been changed in the American edition to Survival in Auschwitz, a bland assertion which quite precisely obscures Levi's question. diacritics / winter 2000 51</page><page sequence="15">to be sacrificed in defense of that freedom. For Bettelheim, regardless of the conditions, a human being can avoid becoming a Muselmann by "accepting death as a human be- ing." But Agamben argues that "Simply to deny the Muselmann's humanity would be to accept the verdict of the SS and to repeat their gesture." The Muselmann "does not merely embody a moral death," rather he "is the site of an experiment in which morality and humanity are called into question," he is "a limit figure of a special kind, in which not only categories such as dignity and respect but even the very idea of an ethical limit lose their meaning." To acknowledge the Muselmann's compromised humanity, Bettelheim's limit of the human is denied; to avoid the moral barbarism of an imagined confrontation with a Muselmann in which one judges his "character and habits," one renounces ethical terminology. With the Muselmann we find the limit of limits: clear boundaries can no longer be drawn here [Agamben, Remnants ofAuschwitz 56, 63].26 The point is not that the liberal refusal to consider the camp as threshold rules out a solution to this dilemma from the start. The very idea of a solution here seems offensive. The point is rather that the liberal response can make no sense of its own confusion. The camp is simply evil and incomprehensible. The person condemned to a camp is neither capable of morality nor incapable of it. As for the difficult questions this emerging limit of the moral might raise, they too are set aside in favor of a respectful silence.27 In contrast, Agamben's conception of the threshold at least promises to more precisely delineate these confusions: the camp both is and is not a legal, political, and moral space. Hence, we should hardly be surprised to find ourselves torn, wanting both to affirm and to deny that these categories apply here. Finally, the liberal strategy reveals its limitations when we recognize that the no- tion of the threshold is in fact expanding into areas where we will not have the luxury of refusing to consider the inner logic of phenomena we should like to reject as evil and incomprehensible. What, for instance, are we to do when we are dealing with agents or things that have not already been recognized as the bearers of rights? Here the reassertion of rights is simply not an option. We must decide whether a neomort-a body whose only signs of life are that it is "warm, pulsating, and urinating"-is in fact a human being at all, an agent or a thing. In such cases, "life and death [cease to be] properly scientific concepts [and become] political concepts, which as such acquire a political meaning precisely only through a decision" [Homo Sacer 164]. Ironically, such deci- sions are increasingly made by scientists, and not by politicians: "In the biopolitical horizon [orizzonte biopolitico] that characterizes modernity, the physician and the sci- entist move into the no-man's-land [terra di nessuno] into which at one point the sover- eign alone could penetrate" [159]. These are still marginal figures in our current politi- cal life. But if Agamben is right, the concept of the margin is itself being swept away. It is this that leads him to conclude that the camp is the as-yet-unrecognized paradigm of the modern. As the logic of the sovereign exception comes unraveled (or is realized- this paradox being a necessary function of that logic), and the impossibility of categori- cally distinguishing between exception and rule is made manifest, the distinction be- tween bare life and political life is hopelessly confused. "When life and politics-origi- nally divided, and linked together by means of the no-man's land of the state of excep- tion that is inhabited [abita] by bare life [la nuda vita]-begin to become one, all life becomes sacred and all politics becomes the exception" [148].28 26. This line of analysis is also followed in the second chapter of Slavoj Zizek's Did Some- body Say Totalitarianism? 27. I do not wish to suggest that silence is inappropriate. Claude Lanzmann's Shoah incor- porates such silence to profound effect in its oblique approach to the camps. 28. Though Agamben does not discuss it, one of the best examples of this collapse of the rule into the exception and of politics into life may be the corporate investigation and purchase of the 52</page><page sequence="16">In the end, the attempt to resist this through the assertion of human rights ignores the connection between the humanism that undergirds the concept of rights and the events that seem to conflict with it. Agamben's argument is not that Aristotle's or Locke's reflections on politics carry with them an implicit commitment to the substantive racist policies of National Socialism; nor does he claim that they "caused" the Holocaust (a term to which he objects [114]). What he does argue is that there is a deep affinity between such contemporary horrors and the tradition of political philosophy to which we might turn in an effort to understand and combat such phenomena. The practical implication would not be that there is no difference between Aristotle or Hitler, but that Aristotle will not provide a stable point from which to critique those who follow after him, or from which to construct an alternative.29 There is no Archimedean point outside biopolitics. Politics is always a matter of the body, and "The 'body' is always already a biopolitical body" [187]. If Agamben's analysis and description of this dilemma of the formation of the political and of political identity is strikingly original, the nonmetaphysical alternative toward which he gestures in response is more familiar. In an earlier discussion of the politics of the sacred, he argues that the sacred bears within itself subversive potential, in that as a marginal supplement of political identity, it itself lacks identity. This opens up the pos- sibility of a mode of being that escapes the metaphysics of politics, and hence of thana- tology. "In the final instance the State can recognize any claim for identity. ... What the State cannot tolerate in any way, however, is that the singularities form a community without affirming an identity, that humans co-belong without an representable condi- tion of belonging." The Allied response to the Nazi extermination of the Jews is instruc- tive in this regard. Rather than acknowledge the sacred character of the Jewish people (as a people whose extermination "was not conceived as a homicide by [either] the executioners [or] the judges"), they "tried to compensate for this lack of identity with the concession of a State identity, which itself became the source of new massacres" [Coming Community 87-88; cf. Homo Sacer 114]. To break out of this vicious cycle, Agamben follows Jean-Luc Nancy in attempting to "think" community without unity.30 In so doing, both will follow Heidegger (though hardly without criticism) in his attempt to develop a poetic mode of speech beyond metaphysics. What Agamben adds to this is his emphasis upon bare life: human genome. The day is at hand when the decision on the human being will become the rule. The definition of the human being, like that of death, will become too fluid to serve as a guide for the judgments on its modifications, and lawyers, scientists, and political theorists will simply not be able to chart the expansion of our present boundaries into the dark seas that confront us. 29. Derrida strikes a similarly ambivalent attitude toward the humanism that would de- nounce "biologism, racism, [and] naturalism" in On Spirit [56]. 30. See Homo Sacer 44, 47, 60, 182-88, and, for an indication of the ultimately Heideggerian nature of this strategy, 150-53; and compare Jean-Luc Nancy (whose influence Agamben ac- knowledges throughout Homo Sacer): "the thinking of community as essence ... is in effect the closure of the political because it assigns to community a common being, whereas community is a matter of something quite different, namely existence insofar as it is in common without letting itself be absorbed into a common substance. Being in common means no longer having, in any form, in any empirical or ideal place, such a substantial identity, and sharing this "lack of iden- tity." This is what philosophy calls 'finitude'" [xxxviii]. I have tried to indicate some of the limi- tations of this strategy in "Jean-Luc Nancy and the Myth of the Common." diacritics / winter 2000 53</page><page sequence="17">Only a reflection [una rifflessione] that ... thematically interrogates the link between bare life [nuda vita] and politics, a link that secretly governs [governa] the modern ideologies seemingly most distant from one another will be able to ... return thought to its practical calling [restituire il pensiero alla sua vocazione practical. [Homo Sacer 4-5] This emphasis, however, changes everything, and it is worth detailing the distance it places Agamben from Heidegger and the work he has inspired. When Agamben writes that political practice is "governed" by "the link between bare life and politics" we must be careful to note that this link is not one that has been forged by willful or culpable philosophers. Political practice reproduces the older struc- tures we find in western political philosophy not because it is produced by that philoso- phy but because both express a metaphysical quandary that is distinct from each. This way of putting the matter suggests that the relation between the two is one between "politics" and "the political"; on this model, the former refers to the empirical data of actions and events and the latter refers to the system of meaning or intelligibility within which the empirical manifests itself.31 One advantage of this quasi-theatrical schema is that it allows us to conceive of politics and political philosophy as distinct things that nonetheless map onto one another: the system of intelligibility is an intelligibility of events and actions and intentions. In the absence of the latter, there would be nothing to be either politically meaningful or meaningless. Conversely, in the absence of a concep- tion of what meaning is and how it can achieved, no behavior could rise to the status of political action at all. This distinction is generally derived from Heidegger, ultimately from his thinking of the ontological distinction and most immediately from his writings on technology. Heidegger argues that technology is not the application of scientific theory. Rather, scientific theory itself arises in response to the technological demand that nature be reduced to "a calculable coherence of forces" that can be represented and used for the representation and application of force. "Modern physics is the herald of enframing, a herald whose provenance is still unknown."32 Although the technological mode of re- vealing is a nihilistic one in which instrumental reason reigns supreme, that reason is itself not an instrument. As a mode of revelation it is "the destining of revealing" or Being in our time. Hence Heidegger's famous dictum, "the essence of technology is nothing technological." Hence as well his caution that we neither respond with "a stul- tified compulsion to push on blindly with technology [nor], what comes to the same, ... rebel helplessly against it and curse it as the work of the devil" ["Question Concern- ing Technology" 330, 340, 330]. Lacoue-Labarthe has echoed Heidegger's claims here, and suggested that "the es- sence of the political ... is by itself nothing political" ["In the Name of .. ." 71], a claim that is at the heart of his own attempt to develop a distinction between politics and the political. He offers the helpful suggestion that the relationship between politics and the 31. The best and most relevant version of this distinction can be found in Philippe Lacoue- Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy, Retreating the Political. For a survey of other places it can be found, see Dallmayr, particularly 9, 41, 50-52, 87-88. It should be noted that Dallmayr's enthu- siasm for the distinction leads him to gloss over differences between the various formulations of it. He suggests, for instance, that Schmitt's concept of the political is analogous to Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy's essence of the political [Dallmayr 50]; but the latter two take pains to note that this is not so. Compare Retreating the Political 109. The point is significant only because it demon- strates how vague this distinction remains in most cases. 32. Heidegger, "Question Concerning Technology" 326-27.

This nicely captures the relative priority of the philosophical, while also retaining the neces- sary reminder that both politics and the political are what they are because they repre- sent something else. It is fairly clear that Agamben would claim the same. But there is an important shift here in his work. Even if we grant that the relation between the politi- cal (for example, the thematic subject of [moments of] Aristotle's Politics) and politics (for example, the death camps) is a noncasual one in which both are expressions of the essence of metaphysics, there remains a fundamental discrepancy between the roles these two play in Agamben's argument. In Agamben's work canonical texts are de- picted as giving expression to an unstable logic, one that inevitably comes unraveled on the level of (empirical) politics. Indeed, as in the opening paragraphs of my own article, it is recent empirical events that provide the pathos and the urgency to Agamben's dis- cussion. Agamben does not set out only to provide us with an insightful way to read the canon, though he does succeed in that. He sets out to address the catastrophe of our time. And it will ultimately be addressed by that "which enacts the experience merely shown by logic." In so emphasizing the pathos of politics over that of the political Agamben sharply distinguishes himself from Heidegger, who if anything takes the opposite approach. As Heidegger explicitly and repeatedly states, the danger of technology is not the threat it poses to human life, but the danger it poses to the dignity of the human being as thinker- that is, the danger it poses to thought.33 His infamous equation of the death camps with the mechanized food industry is wholly consistent with this: "Agriculture is now a mo- torized food industry, essentially the same thing as the fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers of the extermination camps, the same thing as the blockades and the reduc- tion of countries to famine, the same thing as the fabrication of hydrogen bombs."34 To say that the "motorized food industry" is "essentially the same thing" as "the fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers of the extermination camps" would seem to imply that the converse is true as well: the metaphysical significance of Auschwitz is precisely that of a factory farm. Because of his emphasis upon bare, embodied life, Agamben cannot take such a tack. For those appalled by the rough equating of the food industry and the death camps, this is all for the better. But it does result in a privileging of one of the two purported expressions of the metaphysical quandary of politics that we would not find in a purely Heideggerian analysis. It is as if Agamben's text were enacting what he claims is the characteristically paradoxical inclusion of life within metaphysics. The strength of Agamben's analysis is that it does not merely add something to Heidegger's own work, but it allows us to see how the latter evades the problems Agamben confronts. I have alluded above to Agamben's own discussions of the later Heidegger's thinking of death. I should like to conclude by noting the manner in which the problem of life dogs Heidegger from the start, from Being and Time, the source of much of our 33. "What is dangerous is not technology.... The essence of technology, as a destining of revealing, is the danger ... The threat to man does not come in the first instance from the poten- tially lethal machines and apparatus of technology. The actual threat has already afflicted man in his essence. The rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth" ["Question Concerning Technology" 333]. Compare the discussion of the dignity of the human essence on 337. 34. Cited in Zimmerman 43. Zimmerman correctly notes that Heidegger here "glided over the fact that the Holocaust was a German phenomenon involving the slaughter of millions of Jews. Instead he chose to view the Holocaust as a typical episode of the technological era afflict- ing the entire West" [43]. diacritics / winter 2000 55</page><page sequence="19">thinking of the ontological distinction that Agamben's emphasis upon life both follows and challenges. In the opening pages of Part One of Being and Time, Heidegger betrays an anxiety concerning the distinction between fundamental ontology and biology-an anxiety that corresponds to the introduction's suggestion that the former will either indicate or enact a true politics: "The existential analytic of Da-sein is prior to any psychology, anthropology, and especially biology [erst recht Biologie]" [42].35 One wonders, Why "especially" biology? Why does Heidegger in his 1929-30 lecture course return to the question of the biological, and address biology alone as a metaphysically significant positive science [see Heidegger, Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics]? The immediate answer is that, though Heidegger suggests that he pursues a concept of the natural, this concept proves to be insufficient to delineate the ontology of the worlding of the world [see, for example, Being and Time 59-60]. Heidegger seeks to distinguish his own project from the work of Dilthey and Bergson and Nietzsche even as it builds upon that work. But the terms in which he does so are striking indeed: in a paragraph that begins with the consideration of the anthropological tendencies of psychology, Heidegger quickly turns to the rejection of "a general biology" as a science that might provide the "ontological foundations" (ontologische Fundament) that anthropology neglects. In the order of possible understanding and interpretation, biology as the "sci- ence of life" is rooted [fundiert] in the ontology of Da-sein, although not ex- clusively [ausslieBlich] in it. Life has its own kind of being, but is essentially [wesenhaft] accessible only in Da-sein. The ontology of life takes place by way of a privative interpretation. It determines [bestimmt] what must be the case if there can be anything like just-being-alive.36 Life is neither pure objec- tive presence, nor is it Da-sein. On the other hand, Da-sein should never be defined [bestimmen] ontologically by regarding it as life-(ontologically un- determined [unbestimmt]) and then as something else on top of that. [Being and Time 46] The concluding claims are familiar enough: Da-sein is not an aggregation of life (the animal) and "something else" (rationality); rather, each of these is seen as what it is only by way of "a privative interpretation" that begins with Da-sein as being-in-the-world. But neither is it the case that such an interpretation can fully account for life-for life is not merely an abstraction from the unity of Da-sein-it is not exclusively founded in the ontology of Da-sein. Nur-noch-leben is neither decisively included in nor excluded from the ontology of Da-sein. It is, in other words, included as a problem-or, perhaps better, included as an exclusion. If the human being could be reduced to the level of bare life it would be neither an object nor Da-sein. What it would be remains a mystery- albeit perhaps one produced by our uncanny inability to see what is nearest to us. 35. Concerning the relation of Being and Time to politics, consider the use of scare quotes in the following: "Philosophical anthropology, anthropology, ethics, 'politics,' 'biography, and his- toriography pursue in all different ways and to varying extents the behavior, faculties, powers, possibilities, and destinies of Da-sein" [14]. In each case Heidegger is anxious to propose his fundamental ontology as the science that can do what these ontic sciences fail to do. Simon Sparks discusses the allusion to politics in his introduction to Retreating the Political [165n16]. 36. Heidegger's German is more categorical: "sie bestimmt das, was sein mufJ, daft so etwas wie Nur-noch-leben sein kann." 56</page><page sequence="20">WORKS CITED Agamben, Giorgio. The Coming Community.
