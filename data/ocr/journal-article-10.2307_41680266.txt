Does architect Rinaldo Semino (1937-) truly represent a "troubling" case in respect to the notion of the "organic" in postwar Italian architecture? Semino's experimental work from 1 965 to 1 972 is representative of an approach taken by a number of archi- tects in Italy at the time: the interpretation of natural analogies in architecture as dynamic responses to both internal organization and external pressures through the use of prefabricated structural elements, which are brought together to make a whole out of constituent parts. Semino's work points to an alternate organic architecture, one that does not literally imitate biomorphic, crys- talline, or other "natural" forms. In fact, his work troubles the assumption that organic architecture must resemble natural forms and proposes an architecture that is not only modern and industrial but also organic in that the architectural parts come together in ways that are syntactical and organiza- tional.1 In short, the organization implies the organism of architecture. In order to fully appreciate this discus- sion, one must examine the origin of the term organic architecture and the prevailing stylistic interpretation of the term in postwar Italy. Examples of organic architecture from the 1960s illustrate the shift in the mean- ing of the term organic - a semantic change that is most evident in Semino's work. In fact, a critical elision in the English transla- tion of Bruno Zevi's Verso un'architettura organica fully illustrates the way in which the term organic came to be misunderstood in architecture. The missing (or mistranslated) text is crucial in that it points to the salient characteristics of Zevi's definition of organic architecture. Furthermore, it opens up the potential for alternate formal strategies of the organic that were not taken on by the followers of the movement founded in Romein 1944 by Zevi, L'Associazione per l'Architettura Organica (or the APAO). Written in London in 1944 after a period of refuge in the United States from 1940 to 1942, Verso un'architettura organica 2 was published in 1945. With this seminal work, Zevi brought the notion of an architecture of democracy articulated by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright to Italy. However, Wright's work had already been published in Italy by Edoardo Persico in the early 1930s, and Zevi certainly went to the United States with his admiration of Wright firmly in place.3 Forced to leave his architectural studies in Rome due to the enforcement of anti-Semitic laws in Italy in 1938, Bruno Zevi had a brief sojourn at the Architectural Association in London. As deeply involved in anti-Fascist organizations in London as he had been in Italy, Zevi became dissatis- fied with the low level of commitment and activity in the London group and left for Paris to discuss his options with the leaders of the group Giustizia e Libertà. It was decided that Zevi would try to obtain a student visa to study in the United States and there publish an anti-Fascist magazine that would be smuggled into Italy via France. Zevi was granted admission to the Harvard Graduate School of Design by Walter Gropius, and he managed to publish the magazine Quaderni Italiani while studying in the 1940-41 aca- demic year.4 Once at Harvard, Zevi objected to Gropius's pedagogy of architectural educa- tion, and as a result, he launched an attack on the GSD as a whole, and against Gropius in particular, in the pamphlet "An Opinion on Architecture." Zevi disagreed with the tenets held by the Bauhaus and, by extension, the Fig.1 Rinaldo Semino, original pen on vellum, blueprint copy, 1969.

Exacerbating the situation even further, Zevi immediately clashed with classmate Philip Johnson, who had returned to Harvard after his tenure at the Museum of Modern Art. In the simplest of terms, Zevi could not accept that modern architecture had been reduced to stylistic issues at the cost of what was for him the pur- pose of architecture: a free society in which social justice and equality were paramount.5 In the article "An Organic Architecture, the Architecture of Democracy" of 1939, Frank Lloyd Wright wrote that freedom is a critical feature of organic architecture and sought to define his broad-ranging notion of freedom: The law of change is immutable law; the only law we have not taken into account. It is the only law we have not learned to consider and respect when we proceed to make FORM. We have tried to stem and hold in check the tides of life. Now, why go on with it? Why not see that if pattern is to be made at all it must be free pattern, the one most suited to growth, the one most likely to encourage and concede growth to life? That means, I think, the end of the word "institution" as we have it set up.6 This way of speaking must have been critical for Zevi. His critique of the Inter- national style centered on its reduction of the social and political aspects of modern architecture to merely formal concerns. Zevi had the same critique of Sigfried Giedion who, in his Space, Time and Architecture of 1941 , articulated a new theory of architec- ture that minimized the social implications of modernism and advocated a stylistic interpretation of the modern movement. Zevi disagreed with Giedion's promotion of the Bauhaus and the Villa Savoye as the highest forms of modern architecture. While Giedion discussed Wright's work and acknowledged organic architecture as a movement, he was not the most flattering critic in his descrip- tion of Wright: Wright's whole career was an endeavor to express himself, in what he called "organic architecture," whatever that may be. He liked to work in the shadow of this feeling. When, on January 25, 1940, he lectured in Jackson Hall, Boston, he devoted his entire discus- sion to this problem of his life. He tried by a sort of Socratic dialogue, a give- and-take between himself and his audi- ence, to define and explain it. But his effort was futile. It was clear, finally, that no explanation was possible in words, that what he meant by organic architec- ture could only be revealed in his work.7 Would Zevi be more successful in defining organic architecture in Verso un'architettura organica ? Zevi spoke at length about Wright's work. He believed that Wright was able to unite, in an organic man- ner, the function of the building with the de- sires of its inhabitants and the relationship of the building to the landscape in which it was situated. Zevi consistently insisted that the organic was not a stylistic category but was defined by an "openness" of spatial arrange- ments. For Zevi, Wright's idea of "functional- ism" was related to that of his teacher Louis Sullivan. Zevi viewed the concept of the open plan as the "modern" concept, which was common to both functionalism and or- ganic architecture. Rather than a volumetric or decorative approach, the open plan was, above all, a spatial concept. In order to il- lustrate this, Zevi compared the Villa Savoye to Fallingwater, in which the loose spatial arrangement of interior spaces was matched by the poetry of volumes suspended in air.8 Zevi feared that Giedion's promotion of the International style would lead to a sterile and mechanistic approach to modern architecture that "would be followed by a chaotic revolt against it."9 Zevi wanted his book to be more than just a discussion of the various formal and spatial characteristics of organic architecture; in fact, he wanted his book to provide a model for how to facil- itate a "post-war reconstruction of Europe along democratic architectural principles."10 Andrea Oppenheimer Dean compares Zevi's outlook to that of anti-Fascist writer Carlo Levi, who in his book Christ Stopped at Eboii wrote about the need to rebuild a concept of the state based on the individual. She quotes Levi: The individual is not a separate unit, but a link, a meeting place of relation- ships of every kind. This concept of relationship, without which the individ- ual has no life, is at the same time the basis of the State. The individual and the State coincide in theory and they must be made to coincide in practice as well, if they are to survive.. .The State can only be a group of autonomies, 5 Andrea Oppenheimer Dean, Bruno Zevi on Modern Architecture (New York: Rizzoli, 1983) , 23. 6 Frank Lloyd Wright, "An Organic Architec- ture, the Architecture of Democracy," in The Sir George Watson Lectures of the Sulgrave Manor Board for 1939 (London: Lund, Humphries &amp; Co . , 1939; repr . , Cambridge: MIT Press, 1970) , 18. 7 Sigfried Giedion , "The Urge Towards the Organic , " in Space , Time and Architecture : The Growth of a New Tradition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991 ) , 414. 8 Bruno Zevi , "L'architettura or- ganica di fronte ai suoi critici," Metron 23-24 (Rome: Editrice Sandron , 1948): 43-44.

The Troubling Case of Rinaldo Semino an organic federation... the autonomy of the factory, the school, and the city, of every form of social life. [Italics added]1 1 It is this sense of the organic that is of interest to the larger discussion. Rather than top-down organization, unity could arise from the interaction and cooperation of au- tonomous individuals. Giedion reminds us of the clarity with which Wright's mentor, Louis Sullivan, had defined organic architecture in his 1900 book, Kindergarten Chats, in which he defined the organic as the "ten-fingered grasp of reality." While Sullivan speaks directly of architecture, the relation to Levi's description of the organic relationships in society is clear. Giedion wrote: Architecture, when built, must create a unity from a number of different parts. One of the many ways to achieve the spatial relationships that transform an assembly of parts into a unity is through the use of a system of propor- tions or of a simple module - that is, by employing certain measurements that recur in all three dimensions. The foundation of architecture is bound up with its relations to propor- tions and to geometrical forms. But architecture is not only a geometrical structure. It is not solely dependent on Fig. 2 Hermann Finsterlin, architectural project, Deutsches Architecktur -Museum , Frankfurt, 1920. This drawing explores an explicit reference to biological form. The spiral form, emerging from the earth prompts one to think of its continued growth and transformat ion . (Repr. p. 178) eternal laws. It exists to serve man, who is as perishable as a plant. Thus architecture also bears certain human and plant-like traits.12 Historian Philip Steadman succinctly describes the Aristotelian roots of this notion in his work on the biological analogy in architecture: Critics and philosophers since ancient Greece have looked to natural organ- isms as offering perfect models of that harmonious balance and proportion between the parts of a design which is synonymous with the classical ideal of beauty. The qualities of wholeness, of integrity, of a unity in structure such that the parts all contribute to the effect or purpose of the whole, and no part may be removed without some damage to the whole.13 What is clear in this description is that the organic wholeness of a work of art or nature is derived from a consonance of its parts. Various approaches have been taken in defining what constitutes an organic form in the early twentieth century, but all fall short of this complex definition of the organic. For example, biomorphic, body-like shapes have been utilized to evoke freedom Fig. 3 Wenzel Hablik, from the series "Exhibition buildings," Wenzel Hablik Stiftung, Hitzehoe. This drawing integrates the logic of crystalline geometric structures.

While Zevi would have likely been sympa- thetic to the politi- cal leanings of the group, he would have been critical of their use of form. Zevi preferred architecture that seemed capable of change through modifi- cations and changes in a repetitive element rather than an overall naturalistic form. 34</page><page sequence="5">Alicia Imperiale of expression and harmonious proportions that are shared with natural form - e.g., the work of Hermann Finsterlin, the crystal- like work of Wenzel Hablik, or the work of Bruno Taut as seen in the pages of Frühlicht ,14 This overt appeal to the Isomor- phic led architect Bruno Zevi, in the chapter "Meaning and Scope of the Term Organic" in Verso un'architettura organica, to critique the architectural use of the word organic and caution architects to be "on guard" against two fallacies: the literal imitation of natural forms (i.e., the tendrils and flowing boughs of art nouveau and romantic architecture) and the misappropriation of the proportions and anthropomorphic references to the human body in architecture seen in expressionism.15 While Zevi successfully distanced himself from expressionism and biomorphic form, as representative of organic architec- ture, he perhaps unwittingly advocated the hexagonal and crystalline forms of Frank Lloyd Wright and the sinuous forms of Alvar Aalto as formal expressions of the organic. The approach was to work with the geomet- ric and principally planimetrie repetition of spaces created by repeated elements with slight variations. Critical to Zevi's definition of the organic is the determined resistance to static and symmetrical organization seen in the work of Aalto and Wright. The essential trait of Zevi's organic architecture - anti-symmetrical organiza- tion - derived from his bitter criticism of the corruption of modern architecture by architects of the Fascist regime. By co- opting modernism crossed with an autarkic conflation of modern Italian nationhood with its "Roman-ness" and prior imperialist role across the Mediterranean, the architects of Fascist Italy used overt references to classical architecture that they merged with the imported model of modern architecture: this stripped down, classically organized modernism became representative of the Fascist regime. Zevi equated the symmetrical with the regime and urged architects to refuse to obey laws of symmetry; he believed that this was the most important manner in which architects could advocate for the free expression of a society through architecture. If the architecture refused to adhere to formal reductiveness and monumentality, it would stand as a physical sign of opposition to the fallen regime.16 For Zevi, Wright's text on the architec- ture of democracy established the main line of attack on the architecture of the Fascist period: rationalist architecture. Italian rationalism, in Zevi's view, forced symmet- ical organizations and the classical orders on modern architecture. Zevi wanted to rescue modern architecture from this assault. His organic architecture proposed using the techniques and spatial qualities of modern architecture to free the organization from any vestige of classical architecture.17 Hence, Zevi's approach shares some central features with rationalism for he sought to create a "genuinely modern architecture in which social progress and technical innovation would go hand in hand."18 Yet, Zevi's invitation to produce an organic architecture calls for form that promotes asymmetrical relationships between the elements andarticulates the differences in the elements that constitute the whole. It also still focuses upon the efficiency in production in the architectural realm rather than returning to a nostalgia for the handmade, or the vernacular. The problem with Zevi's approach is that many Italian architects interpreted his call for organic architecture - while others criticized him for his unabashed worship of Frank Lloyd Wright - by adopting forms that looked like fragmented crystals or other geometric organizational structures that seemed to "represent" the organic. These projects were comparatively simplistic formal interpretations of what the organic should look like.19 In his Verso un'architettura organica, Zevi united the necessity for the postwar architect to address the critical housing shortage with his manifesto of form-making; he also merged an interest in the prefab- ricated house, which consisted of various manufactured elements, with the potential for the constitutive elements to be brought together in various ways, emulating, as such, an organic approach through the ensemble of inflected parts. It is this aspect, similar to Giedion's description of the interrelationship of elements and also in line with Steadman's definition of the organic as "a unity in struc- ture such that the parts all contribute to the effect or purpose of the whole, and no part may be removed without some damage to the whole," that is Zevi's main thesis - a notion that gets buried in later interpreta- tions of Verso un'architettura organica. In the initial three chapters of his text Verso un'architettura organica, Bruno Zevi summarizes the ascent of modern architecture in the interwar period in "The 15 Bruno Zevi, "Meaning and Scope of the Term Organic in Modern Architecture , " in Towards an Organic Architecture , 73-74. Here Zevi refers' to Geoffrey Scott's text The Architecture of Humanism : A Study in the History of Taste (New York; Houghton Mifflin , 1914) . See also Louise Durning, "The Architecture of Humanism: An His- torical and Critical Analysis of Geoffrey Scott's Architectural Theory" (PhD thesis, University of Essex, United Kingdom, 1990) . 16 This is part of a much larger discussion in the context of the internal debate be- tween the rationalists and the traditional- ists in postwar Italy. Modern architecture was to suffer from its association with the architects who had worked under Fascism (Terragni, Libera, Moretti, etc.). These architects produced extraordinary works, but the backlash against modernism was extreme. We see in the rebuilding campaign of INA-Casa and in the work of Mario Ridolfi and others a return to traditional construc- tion and form as a re- sponse to this issue. Zevi's promotion of organic architecture fits into this discus- sion, but he looked abroad to Wright as a model of formal variation that would reflect a free society. Above all, symmetry was the taboo gesture. 17 Bruno Zevi , Verso un ' architettura organica, 12. 18 Alan Colquhoun, Modem Architecture (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002) . 19 Here I refer to the work of Savioli, Gardella, D'Olivo, Soleri, Ricci, Scarpa, Pellegrin, Giorgini, Galvagni, Portoghesi, etc. Many of these architects were associated with the Florentine group of organic architects in- fluenced by Michelucci. 35</page><page sequence="6">Organic Italy?

In the second part of the book, Zevi outlines "Architectural Tradition in the United States" and looks at the work and influence of Frank Lloyd Wright on contemporary architecture.20 The most interesting part of this book, however, is the intermediate chapter entitled "Meaning and Scope of the Term Organic in Reference to Architecture."21 In this section, Zevi strives to make a connection between modern architecture and a technologically oriented world, distancing his own interests from antiquated modes of production and more overtly organic form. Zevi quotes a catalog for an exhibition of domestic fur- niture (1941) in New York, using the smaller, industrially produced object as ersatz stand-in for architecture: A design may be called organic when there is an harmonious organization of the parts within the whole, accord- ing to structure, material, and purpose. Within this definition there can be no vain ornamentation or superfluity, but the part of beauty is none the less great - in ideal choice of material, in visual refinement, and in rational elegance of things intended for use.22 In the following paragraphs, Zevi writes of his experience in the States, equat- ing industrialization with the possibility of democracy emerging in postwar, industri- ally undeveloped Italy. He writes, moving from the scale of furniture to the scale of the house, and by extension from the single- family house to large-scale developments23 (the following text is my translation): At this point it is important to clarify something: we don't want to state that there is an absolute category into which all organic tendencies fall. But this is not to say that it is not clearly distinguishable and doesn't contrast directly with the other tendency [by this he means inorganic]. There's nothing vague or sentimental about organic tendencies [translated as "the organic" herein]. It is not just an expression of "local color," nor does it only look to- ward the past, neither is it an instinctive improvisation, nor rustic or indigenous building, not the countryside, nor the island of Capri, nor any other kind of provincialism.

What is the most pressing question of the day in England or in America? The prefabricated house, mass produced in industrialized facto- ries. It is therefore in the actual solving of problems that are raised because of the necessity for prefabricated houses that the antithesis between organic and inorganic architecture is most clearly revealed. In England the government has produced a prefabricated house for soldiers returning from the war for public viewing. It is a parallel-piped box divided into four rooms, cold, standard- ized, anonymous, ugly, that has already provoked protest from everywhere; it is an example of classical architecture, geometric, without any possibility of expansion. But in America various designs of prefabricated houses have perhaps opened the way for a new solu- tion: one needs to prefabricate the base unit, baths, kitchens, plumbing and heating systems, bedrooms, perhaps all of the spaces, separately. These units then get assembled together according to the various needs of the inhabitant who will live there. There needs to be the possibility to add and subtract units or spaces, to substitute larger rooms for when the inhabitant outgrows the smaller rooms and vice versa, meaning that the principle of flexibility must be respected, and that of organic growth and reduction.24 With these criteria one could also imagine a house of a mixed construction type in which all of the basic services are prefabricated, and that the living room and the studio could be constructed partly on the site. It is evident that we are dealing with two tendencies that value life in opposite ways. The first is an absolut- ist tendency, totalitarian in the field of housing; the second is elastic and leaves space for life. The first imposes on all inhabitants a suffocating unifor- mity, a total rigidity of life; the second proposes to give to all the means, materials, and equipment in order to have a comfortable house at low cost, but leaving the individual freedom and variety.25 Until this point, I had been using the Italian 1945 version of this text. I decided to consult the English translation, and what I found is of critical importance: Zevi's thesis on the notion of the organic had been eliminated in the English translation, and replacing these key paragraphs is a diluted version of the original. This difference is striking, as I believe that this actually places the emphasis on Wright's work in the chap- ter as an appropriate organic approach, which is not emphasized in the Italian original. Zevi's wider interest in the idea of change in form over time is the salient fea- ture of the organic. In the English translation, these more complex thoughts on fabrication and individual choice are eliminated and constrain the remainder of Zevi's argument, as seen in this paragraph, which replaces the three paragraphs above: The difference between organic and inorganic is not a matter of sentimental emphasis: it concerns the very prob- lem of approach in planning. Between the peasant's almost home-made house, built without an architect, to the last by-product of industrial building, the prefabricated house, the differ- ence is evident. Look for example at the Churchill house, the proposed new mass-produced home for the British people: it is inflexible, classical, imper- sonal, cold. On the other hand in some of the prefabricated houses in Sweden and in America, where each individual room has been prefabricated, it is possible to add or subtract rooms as one pleases. Even with préfabrication, if it be used in this way, every house can be conceived organically, can look different from its neighbors and can express the actual and personal life of its occupants.26 Zevi then states "the word organic can only be applied in its strictest physical sense to some of the products of modern architecture." He then cites the physical attributes and profiles of door handles and chairs by Aalto and Saarinen as emblematic of organic form, as they are in tune with the form of the body. Yet, because he promotes a feeble conflation of ergonomics with an unwitting appeal to the biomorphic (due to the architect's increased attention to life), he deals a devastating blow to his larger argument. He claims that he will articulate this further on, promising that "Its meaning in regard to architecture must be defined... as something equally opposed to the theo- retic and the geometrical, to the artificial 23 It is interesting to note that the im- portation into postwar Europe of the American (and British) model of single- family dwellings for return- ing veterans and/ or the relocation of large numbers of people to work in defense- industry plants in the U.S. seems unconsciously to adopt an anti-urban stance. These projects differ from European re- sponses to the housing crises in which hous- ing was seen in its totality as already an accumulation of the various minimal living units into larger pat- terns of inhabitation. Unlike Max Taut ' s project in Frühlicht Winter 21/22, which considers the single- family house in larger patterns; the Pack- aged House by Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius or similar prefabr icated units were never considered to be brought together with other houses. While very much an open system within its own fabrication logic and seemingly endless in its combinatorial logic based upon an architect's whim or client's desire, it is a closed system so- cially and formally - extending itself out only to modify and anchor itself more comfortably on a small suburban quarter acre (or smaller) site. This is a lapsus that should be inter- rogated and brought into the light. 24 Emphasis mine. 25 Zevi, Verso un ' architettura organica, 69-70.

This definition neatly merges the formal, social, and political values of modern build- ing without prescribing a particular form. Often Zevi's text is viewed as naïve because of his use of Wright and Aalto as examples of the organic. However, the idea of the free exchange of parts in a prefabricated system, Fig. 5 Hans Scharoun, Möller House, near Altruppin, 1937 (top) and Giovanni Michelucci, plan of apartment renovation, Florence, 1946 (bottom). Using this comparison in an important article in Cos abella 339 (1969), critic Giovanni Klaus Koenig outlines the evolution of "organic" architecture in Florence. He cites the influence of Bruno Zevi on the work of Giovanni Michelucci and compares the renovation plan above to the plan of the Möller House by Hans Scharoun. He recounts that Scharoun' s work was not well known in the 1940s and 50s but compares these two images to describe another interpretation of the organic, that is, a revised notion of interior plan and sectional organization being related to exterior conditions. In the case of Michelucci, the interior partitions respond to the irregular boundary of the existing building. Scharoun' s Möller House illustrates the connection between the interior spaces and views out to the landscape. This "functionalist" logic explained the seemingly random asymmetries in the plan. The expression of "organicism" could be logically deduced. allowing for open form and for user partici- pation, more accurately describes Zevi's position. It is this more accurate interpreta- tion that will allow me to speak of Rinaldo Semino's work as organic architecture.28 An Organic Approach Rinaldo Semino's work serves as a case study in the exploration of the alternate use of the term organic architecture proposed by Zevi. Three unbuilt projects by Semino were published in the 1 973 issue of the Italian magazine Zodiac, volume 22, "Light Structures," edited by architectural theorist Maria Bottero. In this issue, Bottero exam- ines the work of ten international architects and engineers in whose work she identifies an interest in morphological research that interrogates the structure of material in design and the models offered from nature. In the introduction she posits that research into the laws governing inorganic material and systems might be extracted to apply to growth in living organisms and to archi- tectural and structural design. Bottero notes especially that: The work of the biologist D'Arcy Thompson has been exemplary here, because it deals with the morphological- structural study of living organisms, starting from their mathematical and physical aspects; it has proposed the natural configurations of matter to designers, both as a source of analo- gous inspiration for physical-structural research. ..as well as inspiration for a method that, in the search for formal definition, may be transposed to the processes of knowledge themselves.29 Bottero's thinking opens the search for formal definitions in critical ways: Morphological research lies on the borderline between physics and biology and the expressive linguistic field. This is justifiable if one considers that, as Chomsky says, thinking and therefore language arise from the "interaction between a particular and complex system, given biologically - that is the human mind, and the physical and social world."30 Zodiac 22 is divided into two sections. The first, which is discussed here, begins 27 Zevi, Towards an Organic Archi- tecture, 72; Verso un ' architettura organica , 71 . 28 In a larger work I examine other Ital- ian architects and engineers who worked in a similar organic mode in the 1960s and looked to underlying organizational prin- ciples in nature to guide their making in a proto-computational manner. I also examine how this work is for- mally quite different to other members of the APAO regional group in Rome, and its national reach, espe- cially in Florence. 29 Maria Bottero, "Questo numero," Zodiac 22 (Milano: Edizione di Comunità, 1973) : v.

This theme can be seen in the work of Félix Candela, Serge Ketoff, Gemot Minke, Renzo Piano, and Rinaldo Semino. Taken as a whole, this group shares an underlying interest in D'Arcy Thompson's On Growth and Form in that it provides them with an approach toward understanding and analyz- ing the dynamical aspects of form. Crescita e Forma: la geometria della natura - as Thompson's On Growth and Form was translated in the 1969 Italian edition - resonated with architects in Italy during this period, and it marked a new approach to organic architecture. This important book investigates how surface tension, cellular divisions, membrane boundaries, and other structural charac- teristics reveal the material structure of nature - how form negotiates the demands of the dynamical forces of the physical world - as well as the invisible and fleeting forces embedded within material itself.31 One of several Italian architects who was to interpret natural analogies in the de- sign of dynamically responsive architecture, Fig. 6 D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, Crescita e Forma: la geometria della natura, 1969. The Italian translation of Thompson's On Growth and Form was widely read by architects and was a critical source of inspiration for Semino. (Repr. p. 178) Semino was deeply influenced by this text during the period of 1965-72. 32 In fact, Semino's interpretation of the natural analo- gies in Thompson's work can be read as generating the syntactical and organization- al principles of his work. This article seeks to move past interpretations of Semino's understanding of organic form that is equated simplistically with a particular style for there is no doubt that Semino interpreted the scientific text thoughtfully and critically. Bottero explains that the significance of Rinaldo Semino's work is that his research provides architecture with "a new basis as a spatial constructive technique through principles and laws drawn from an attentive observation of nature." In Semino's case, his close attention to vegetal and organic tissue structures has led him to develop a series of "base-constructive elements that aggregate in automorphic33 structures in increasing levels of complexity."34 Here the major distinction is clearest: Semino's projects propose a static construc- tion of elements, yet the elements them- selves are changing and reactive to variations in surface and position in the overall struc- ture. In Semino's architecture the element itself is of utmost importance. Each unit is studied exhaustively as a key to how the unit element is brought together in a larger assem- blage. In Semino's conception the structural Fig. 7 Rinaldo Semino, radiating spiral structure based on the Fibonacci series, lightweight board, 1962-63.

I have found photocopies of images from Thompson's books on the verso of sketches in Semino's files. 33 Automorphic is used by Le Ricolais to describe internal laws of growth in a natural form. Le Ricolais studied the geometric rules governing growth in triangulated three- dimensional networks. Semino investigated the term automor- phic as the growth and change that could occur in his construc- tions that would be assembled from smaller elements . 34 Bottero, "Questo nu- mero," vii.

Because the elements work together as a whole, even a force applied at one point is distributed among the different cellular elements. The structure is an assembly of a series of interrelated, similar parts that act together as a whole. This structure may be seen as a concrete example of a system in action. While seemingly static, the forces operating in the structure are dynamic; in fact, it seems that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Rinaldo Semino's unrealized projects, developed in response to industry- and government-sponsored competitions for large-scale housing complexes, transpor- tation hubs, and industrial zones during the postwar economic boom of 1958-63, reflect an interest in industrially produced component systems in architecture: building up complex structures from simple, ele- mental units. His work in this period focuses on the tectonic of the individual unit and the inherent morphological predisposition for accretion in a particular manner. In short, Semino uses dynamical models of organization found in nature as operational techniques with which to design complex macrostructural projects.

(Repr. p. 179)' Semino describes "The Structural Idea" of the macrostructure in the introduction to his eponymous article: The study aims at identifying suitable structures for realizing the macro- architecture in which man will probably concentrate certain of his activities, examples of which, some of them Utopian, are not lacking. Technical possibilities today offer us only two examples of macrostructures: suspension bridges and dams and in the near future will give us vast shell or suspended roofs; structural systems today, do not permit us to realize, for example, multistory macroarchitec- ture.. .it is probable that in the future it will be necessary to construct macro- architecture of industrial, social, and commercial concentrations in restricted territorial zones.35 His approach was to create a very basic structural element that obtained a flat area by opposing two cupped plates. By combin- ing this simple element in various geometri- cally rigorous ways, a macrostructure can be evolved.36 In this way, the elements first are made at a microstructural scale and combine to make a potentially infinite variety of macrostructures. The three projects presented in Zodiac 22 are all constructed from variations on the same base unit, which undergoes scale changes and produces increasingly large projects. The first project shown, a project for the CECA competition of 1 965, centers on the theme of the steel housing unit. In this project, Semino developed a module that used a doubled dome construction to separate and support two slabs, creating a complex framework within which different apartment typologies could be developed. The project is notable for its attention to the innovation in the development of the cel- lular unit, modifying structural organizations found in seashells and vegetable shells. In this project he developed the concept of the automorphic, wherein a structural element at the microscale would then influence the macrostructure or macroscale reading of the relationship of the whole to the part. His project for the INARC/Finsider competition - sponsored by the Italian Institute of Architects and one of the largest steel manufacturers in Italy, the company 35 Rinaldo Semino, "The Structural Idea," Zodiac 22 (Milano: Edizione di Comunità, 1973) : 253. 36 In fact, it is actu- ally the geometry of the initial element that contributes to the larger organiza- tion, much as the packing of the hexago- nal shapes in a honeycomb, in coral colonies, or other natural structures. 41</page><page sequence="12">Organic Italy?

Finsider- again used steel to develop an innovative, deep slab structure which was to be composed of smaller repetitive units for the design of a multi-level shipping con- tainer structure that extends over the water in the port of Genoa. This project addressed environmental issues of the day, leaving the flat land in the river valleys in mountainous Genoa for agricultural use, and proposing a multi-story container structure over the water so as to not spread laterally over too much territory. This project also operates at multiple scales, from the microscale of its flexible and adaptive unit, to the macroscale, where the structure could also be used as a protective barrier for the port of Genoa. Semino's most fascinating project is a road and rail connection between Sicily and the Italian mainland in response to a 1 969 ideas competition sponsored by the Italian highway transportation agency ANAS. Made up of twenty-five-meter concrete cel- lular units that link together and float on the water of the Strait, tethered only on either side, the structure was likened by Semino to the floating ice that makes up the frozen expanses at the Arctic Pole. Nature would offer an analogy for a system whose struc- tural capacity allows for both the continuity of its coverage and its break-up into smaller cellular units. Semino's project, like sea ice, would both float and provide transversal resistance to the force of the strong sea currents and wind. He envisioned the bridge as part of a city-region, which would contain the administrative center for the new region connecting the mainland and Sicily, crossing boundaries between the two and establish- ing a "Strait of Messina Territory." Hence, Semino's importance to con- temporary architectural research revolves around his work's organic approach, which is not formal, but procedural, performative, and operative. His work is prescient in rela- tion to contemporary architectural investiga- tions into emergence and self-organizing systems through the use of computation. Furthermore, Semino's architecture exhibits the "qualities of wholeness, of integrity, of a unity in structure such that the parts all contribute to the effect or purpose of the whole, and no part may be removed without some damage to the whole"37 that Steadman described. It is an architecture that does not merely appear organic; it is an architec- ture that performs organically. 37 Steadman, The Evolution of Designs: Biological Analogy in Architecture and the Applied Arts, 9. * The crucial second paragraph (of the three translated ear- lier in this article) reads: "Qual 'è oggi il problema all'ordine del giorno in Inghil- terra e in America? La casa prefabbr icata costruita in massa negli stabilimenti industriali. Ebbene, proprio nel risolvere i problemi posti dalla necessità di case pre- fabbricate, l'antitesi tra architettura organica ed inorganica si rivela nettisima. In Inghilterra il governo ha sottoposto all'esame del pubblico una casa prefabbr icata da costruirsi in serie per i soldati che tornano dalla guerra. E' un parallelpipedo diviso in quattro stanze, freddo, stan- dardizzato, anonimo, brutto, che ha già provocato proteste da ogni part; è un es- empio di architettura classica, geometrica, senza possibilità di espansione. Ma in America vari tenta- tivi di case prefab- bricate hanno dato le chiave della soluzi- one: bisogna prefab- bricare le unità-base, i bagni, le cucine, gli impianti, le cam- ere da letto, magari tutti gli ambienti, ma distintamente. Le unità vanno poi mon- tate insieme secondo le varie esigenze di chi abiterà la casa, ci deve essere la pos- sibilità di aggiun- gere e di sottrarre ambienti, di sostitu- ire camere più grande a quelle divenute piccole e vice-versa, cioè deve essere ris- pettato il principio della flessibilità, della crescita e della descrescita organica. Con questo criterio si può anche concepire una casa a costru- zione mista in cui tutti i servizi siano prefabbricati, e la stanza di soggiorno e lo studio siano edificati a parte sul posto."
