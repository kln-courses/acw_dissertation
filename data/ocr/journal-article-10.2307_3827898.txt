<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Prasch WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA: THE ISLAMIC-CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY DEBATE IN LATE-VICTORIAN ENGLAND IN OCTOBER 1887 ISAAC TAYLOR, CANON OF YORK, SHOCKED THE LAST-DAY audience at a church conference in Wolverhampton by telling them that Is- lam, "though quite unfitted for the higher races ... is eminently adapted to be a civilizing and elevating religion for barbarous tribes" for whom "Christi- anity is too spiritual, too lofty." The "Christian ideal," Taylor argued, was "unintelligible to savages." Taylor also saw the Christian missionary enter- prise as necessarily connected with the "extension of European trade," which in turn "means the extension of drunkenness and vice and degradation of the people." By contrast, "the lower virtues which Islam inculcates are what the lower races can be brought to understand," and would lead to the elimination of paganism, devil worship, fetishism, cannibalism, human sacrifice, infanti- cide, alcohol abuse, "immoderate dances," "promiscuous intercourse," and much else. As the Spectator put it, Taylor's lecture "must have sounded to many of the clergy present as a lecture on the sacredness of dynamite would sound to an audience of Kings." 2 The Times, in its account of Taylor's address, par- enthetically interpolated his pious audience's response: "Islam as a missionary religion is more successful than Christianity. (Sensation.)"; "Islam has done for civilization more than Christianity. ('Oh, oh.')"; "Islam is not an anti- Christian faith, but a half-Christian faith, an imperfect Christianity. ('Oh.')" Earlier versions of this paper have been read at the April 1988 MVSA conference in Bloomington, Indiana, and in March 1989 at the imperialism seminar of the Institute for Historical Research, London; I have benefited from comments and questions in both cases. I would also like to thank Phyllis Martin, Patrick Brantlinger, Ellen Berkowitz, Andrew Porter, and M. Jeanne Peterson for comments and suggestions at various stages. Finally, I owe particular thanks to K. Dian Kriz, both for astute criticism and for generous allotments of computer time. 1 Isaac Taylor's address was reported in The Times, 8 October 1887, p. 7. The controversy is treated in H. Alan C. Caimes, Prelude to Imperialism: British Reactions to Central African Society, 1840-1890 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1965), pp. 211-214; Caimes's conclusions differ substan- tially from my own. Taylor's talk is also mentioned, in the context of changing late-Victorian Christian missionary aims, by Andrew Porter in "Late Nineteenth-Century Anglican Missionary Expansion: A Consideration of Some Non-Anglican Sources of Inspiration," in Derek Baker, ed., Studies in Church History 15 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1978), pp. 354-357. 2 "Canon Taylor on Islam," Spectator, 15 October 1887, p. 1383.

The ensuing controversy began at the church conference itself, was carried for months in the letters columns of The Times, and, picked up in the pages of the periodical press, continued well into 1890. Nothing in the debate serves to teach us much about nineteenth- century Islam. Rather, the controversy Taylor stirred up reveals the tensions and complexities of late-Victorian religious belief. These complexities belie our own convenient categories, the labels with which we conventionally ap- proach the issues of Victorian religion, missionary endeavor, science, and empire building. The arguments about Islam provide a focus for an examina- tion of the ways in which English believers and unbelievers came to terms with their own religious character in an era of rapid imperial expansion. As religious character was being tested and questioned at home, it was also being more widely propagated abroad, against a range of other, often resistant, reli- gious beliefs. For the late-Victorian missionary enterprise Islam represented the quintessential Other: the faith that was most resistant, most competi- tive. 3 And for Victorians Africa was the obvious arena of contention, the blankest continent on the imperial map. Though the map of Africa was being rapidly filled in by European conquest in the 1880s, in missionary terms it still remained a largely "dark continent," threatened by newly expansive Is- lamic missionary fervor. We can begin to understand the controversy Taylor's talk aroused by following the debate itself, and then by tracing the roots of both Taylor's position and that of his opponents. To explain the surprising duration and vociferousness of the controversy, however, we will have to go deeper, to ex- amine the ideological grounds of both positions. Constellations of ideas about empire, race, culture, and faith emerged around specific points of conten- tion, especially the issues of slavery, polygamy, and progress. Finally, we can return to the debate itself: to the circumstances specific to the 1880s which helped shape it, and to the revealing attempts to arrive at some sort of middle ground between Taylor and his critics. I Taylor encountered his first critics at the 1887 church conference, where six of the speakers that followed him attacked his defense of Islam. The conference's closing speaker, William Joseph Smith, concluded (with favora- ble audience response) that "the cause of Christian missions was not so hope- 3See Edward Said, Orientalism (New York: Pantheon, 1978), for a discussion of the place of Islam within the broader construct of "Orientalism" as it developed out of the imperial encounter. VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA less as Canon Taylor suggested. (Cheers.)"4 The arguments were quickly taken up in the press. The weekly Spectator ridiculed Taylor, The Times edito- rialized against him, the St. James Gazette weighed in on Taylor's side, and Taylor responded to his critics in letters to all three papers. 5 The controversy was then in full swing. In November two periodicals also addressed the issue of Islam and Af- rica. The Church Missionary Society (CMS) monthly Church Missionary In- telligencer ran a sharply critical review of Edward Blyden's Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race, denouncing the author's "hallucinations concerning Mo- hammedanism."6 On the other side of the controversy, Harry H. Johnston focused on the failure of Christian missions in Africa in the November Nine- teenth Century, concluding that the missionary was to be valued only as the "beneficent being who introduces arts and manufactures," who thus acted "as the preparer of the white man's advent, as mediator between the barbarian native and the invading race of rulers." 7 Taylor cited Johnston's article in his next letter to The Times (7 November 1887, p. 13). November was also marked by the opening salvo from Malcolm MacColl, a canon with a long history of anti-Islamic propagandizing. In a se- ries of letters to The Times, MacColl insisted that Islam and civilization were incompatible, and that "the whole fabric of modem civilisation had been the creation of Christianity" (7 November 1887, p. 13; see also 17 November 1887, p. 13; 29 December 1887, p. 5). Also in November Joseph Thomson offered a letter in defense of Taylor (The Times, 14 November 1887, p. 4). Thomson's letter was the second, and last, favorable comment in The Times by someone other than Taylor himself. From this point the controversy wid- ened. Taylor attacked MacColl's integrity8 and initiated an assault on CMS 4 All conference speeches reported in The Times, 8 October 1887, p. 7. 5 In the Spectator, see "Canon Taylor on Islam," pp. 1383-84, and also the "Editorial Response" to Taylor's letter, 22 October 1887, p. 1419; "The New Attack on Missionaries," 5 November 1887, pp. 1483-84; "The Future of the Negro," 3 December 1887, pp. 1651-52.

The issue of whether, as Taylor charged, MacColl was "able to discover impaled Christians where his fellow travellers are only able to discover scarecrows" re- fers to a controversy eleven years before. MacColl's integrity was defended by H. P. Liddon (The Times, 21 November 1887, p. 6), by the Spectator (26 November 1887, p. 1607; 3 December 1887, p. 1653; 17 December, pp. 1734-36), and by MacColl himself (The Times, 29 December 1887, p. 5; Spectator, 24 December 1887, p. 1783).

Bosworth Smith joined forces to accuse Taylor of plagiarism. 9 The newspaper attention to the controversy finally ebbed around the turn of the year. As interest in the issue was fading in the newspapers, it was just ap- pearing in the periodicals. Smith contributed an article to the December Nineteenth Century which lamented the inaccuracies of Taylor's amateur en- thusiasm and went on to give a more qualified reiteration of his own earlier position ("Mahommedanism in Africa," especially pp. 798-800, 804-806). In January Taylor got some support from a surprising source, CMS-connected Thomas P. Hughes, in an essay in the Boston-based Andover Review. Hughes's qualified praise, however, was undercut by the Review's own more critical edi- torial comment. l Taylor himself travelled to Egypt in December and January to reconfirm his opinions about Islam; the experience left him even more convinced that Islam was both progressive and benign. l Meanwhile in the CMS monthly Intelligencer attacks on Taylor began with G. Knox's "A Rejoinder" in the 1887 December issue (also reprinted as a pamphlet). It would be followed by thirteen further articles either directly responding to Taylor or addressing the issue of Islam in Africa, continuing to May 1889. In the April 1888 Contemporary Review MacColl reiterated his position that Islam was "essentially and historically incompatible with civili- sation."12 At a missionary conference in Exeter in June, to which Taylor addressed no papers, five separate talks assaulted Islam. The spirit of the re- marks was not only adversarial, but apocalyptic. "Two religions contend for the mastery of the world," G. E. Post claimed, and if unchecked Islam "shall sweep like a fire that shall devour our Christianity and destroy it." 13 For the missionaries Islam had clearly become a greater danger than heathenism. Late in 1888 Taylor contributed two articles to successive issues of the Fortnightly Review, both directed at the CMS. In the first, "The Great Mis- 9 Eugene Stock in The Times, 30 November 1887, p. 7; R. Bosworth Smith in The Times, 29 Decem- ber 1887, and in "Mohammedanism in Africa," Nineteenth Century 22 (1887), 791-793. For Tay- lor's response see The Times, 24 January 1888, p. 8. Accusations of plagiarism seem a favored tactic of the CMS; the Intelligencer's review of R. Bosworth Smith, for example, accused him of cribbing heavily from a long list of sources ("Mohammed and Mohammedanism," Intelligencer, July 1874, p. 226). Knox's attack on Taylor also accused him of borrowing - but from Blyden, not Smith ("K." [G. Knox], "A Rejoinder," Intelligencer, December 1887, p. 13). 10 Thomas P.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 54</page><page sequence="5">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA sionary Failure," Taylor focused on the flaws of missionary enterprise. In the following issue he zeroed in on the financial accounts of the CMS, finding them "illusive," error-ridden, and mismanaged. Knox defended the mission enterprise in response to Taylor's first article in the November Intelligencer, while Eugene Stock justified CMS finances in both the Fortnightly and the Intelligencer. 14 Much to the annoyance of the CMS, Taylor's first article was reprinted and distributed by the Salvation Army, whose methods Taylor praised. William Booth later withdrew the pamphlet and apologised for its use, according to the CMS account.15 Assessments more favorable to Taylor, but simultaneously sympa- thetic to the missionary point of view, closed out the controversy. In April 1889 Harry H. Johnston added his own view to the debate on missionary suc- cess in the Fortnightly, and the following year argued for an alliance between British and Arab in the civilizing of Africa. 16 And Joseph Thomson offered his own gloomy assessment of imperialism's devastation of Africa and the missionary's inability to grasp the limitations of the African mind in an arti- cle in the Contemporary Review; he concluded, however, that the missionary struggle must continue. 7 With such mixed responses the controversy, for a time, abated. What makes the intensity and duration of the controversy surprising is that nothing Taylor said, and nothing in his critics' reactions, was particu- larly new by 1887. A sympathetic revaluation of Islam had been underway throughout the nineteenth century, initially fuelled by Romantic Orienta- lism. 18 The progress of this revaluation can be traced in Thomas Carlyle's qualified praise of Mohammed in On Heroes and Hero Worship (1841) and Washington Irving's more generously positive portrait, Life of Mahomet 14 Isaac Taylor, "The Great Missionary Failure" and "Missionary Finance," Fortnightly Review 50 (1888), 491-500 and 581-592, respectively.

By the time Irving's popular biography appeared, reviewers were al- ready addressing the rapid expansion of Islam in Africa, almost always men- tioning the comparative failure of Christian missionary efforts as well. 19 Richard Burton's sensational 1855 account of his pilgrimage to Mecca also sought to promote a more sympathetic view of Islam. More crucially, Burton's anthropological perspective on both race and religion was central in shaping the ideas that Taylor drew upon. Quite willing to celebrate Islam wherever he found it, Burton was convinced that it promised progress to Afri- cans: "Were it not for the southward progress of Al-Islam, the slow and si- lent, sure advance of the Perfect Cure, the future of negro Africa would not be bright." 20 As to the outcome of any competition in Africa between Islam and Christianity, Burton had no doubts: "And the day will come when the Law of the Prophet shall rule throughout the lands, when Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hands unto Allah, and shall then rise to her highest point of civilisation." 21 Of course, Burton believed that "highest point" to be far be- low contemporary European standards. This synthesis of a positive view of Islam with a negative critique of the possibilities of Christian missionary efforts in Africa was regularly reiter- ated between Burton's time and Taylor's - by Winwood Reade in 1863, R. Bosworth Smith in 1874, Edward Blyden in 1875-76, Wilfrid Blunt in 1881-82, and Joseph Thomson in 1886.22 Taylor added nothing to these ar- guments in his assessment of Islam, of missionary success in Africa, or of the capabilities of the African. Indeed, the list of vices that conversion to Islam eliminated and the enumeration of advantages Islamic missionaries had over their European counterparts had become thoroughly standardized by Taylor's time. If Taylor contributed anything new to the formulas, it was an increas- 19 See, for instance, "Mohammedanism: Its Rise and Present Progress," Bentley's Miscellany 27 (1850), 598. 20 Richard Burton, A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome, 2 vols.

The anti-Islamic position was, if anything, even more deeply en- trenched in 1887 than was Taylor's. The main elements of that tradition, in- cluding the emphasis on the sinful life of Mohammed, the lustful character of his followers, the violence of Islamic expansion, and the static nature of the religion, can be traced to late-medieval polemics against Islam. 23 The revita- lization of this tradition from the 1830s onward, with a marked emphasis on the unprogressive character of Islam, coincided with the expansion of Euro- pean contact and the early phases of the colonization of the Mideast and North Africa. 24 Against the writings of Burton and Reade, the missionary side could cite travel accounts more negative toward Islam and missionary accounts more positive toward Christianity. Increasingly from mid-century, they could also cite accounts of Islam written from a Christian point of view, in the works of such writers as John Muehlheisen Arold, William Muir, Thomas P. Hughes, and Henry H. Jessup. 25 In all these works comparative religion is put at the service of a call for a civilizing missionary enterprise. By the time of Taylor's talk, then, the Christian missionary response was as standardized as the pro-Islamic position. That response was reiterated whenever Islamicist arguments were made in a public forum, although never with the concentrated force brought to bear on Taylor. Before asking why Taylor provoked such fury, we must examine the assumptions that underpin the two positions and the central tensions between the two sides. II The Islamicists' notion that Islam could be a stepping-stone to Chris- tianity for the African conflated two hierarchical systems: the ranking of races that had become a mainstay of late-Victorian anthropology, and the charting by cultural anthropologists of religious systems on a line of "prog- ress" or "development" that moved unequivocally upward from "primitive" animism to "civilized" spiritual monotheism. The language of the Islamicists 23 Norman Daniel, Islam and the West (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1958), pp. 275-276; see also Said, pp. 58-72. 24 Philip Curtin, Images of Africa: British Ideas and Actions, 1780-1850 (Madison: University of Wis- consin Press, 1964), pp. 405-406; Rodinson, p. 60; Said, p. 41.

AUTUMN 1989 57</page><page sequence="8">Thomas Prasch reveals their sources: references to racial types and cranial capacity echoed then-current debates about racial differentiation; insistence that Islam was not just more advanced but more "complex" and "differentiated" than ani- mism can be traced to Herbert Spencer's schema for cultural progress or to other patterns of development common in anthropological writing. 26 The conflation of the two hierarchies is obvious in the case of Burton, whose discussion of the origin of Islam is explicitly framed in a developmental schema moving from fetishism through polytheism to a monotheism that be- comes progressively less anthropomorphic ("El Islam," pp. 289-312). Burton also believed that conditions - climatological and historical - could lead to degeneration as well as progress, and that the development of Christianity in the East was progressive up to the time of Jesus, regressive in the centuries fol- lowing (pp. 318-320). Against this background, Mohammed offered a revita- lization of monotheistic principles particularly suited to warmer climates and degenerated populations (pp. 321-323, 336-338). These characteristics suited Islam to the Africans, who in Burton's view were on the lowest level of the hierarchy of races, the pure negro lowest of them all. The racism fundamental to the Islamicist argument can be seen in the roles played by Burton and Reade in the controversy over James Hunt's paper "On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of the Negro." Hunt asserted that the physical and mental differences between blacks and whites were sub- stantial enough to "classify the Negro as a distinct species from the Euro- pean."27 Reade, though he did not question a racial hierarchy with the pure negro as the lowest human form, had earlier rejected arguments for consider- ing the negro a separate species (Savage Africa, pp. 506-509, 526-528). Hearing the paper at the Anthropological Society, however, Reade accepted Hunt's claims, and directly linked that argument to his own conviction that Islam rather than Christianity must take the role of "elevating their character in every possible way" (p. xix; see also p. xxxix). Burton missed the meeting, but he supplied his own favorable response in the chapter "Of 'The Negro's Place in Nature' " in A Mission to Gelele (pp. 122-140). Burton devoted the greater portion of the chapter to a catalogue of his "observations" confirming arguments for black inferiority. Burton "attribute[d] the general failure of English missionary enterprise in Africa" to the failure to appreciate the "facts" of racial difference (p. 122). Burton closed the chapter with his prophecy of Is- 26 On the centrality of developmental schema to late-Victorian anthropology, see George W.

Reviewing Burton's book for the Anthropological Re- view, Reade singled out this chapter for particular praise. 28 Hunt's separate-species argument played into the polygenesis debate which sharply split mid-century anthropology. But the settlement of that dis- pute did not put an end to anthropological racism, which continued to employ physiognomic, environmental, degenerative, and hierarchical assumptions to affirm the place of the negro at the bottom of the human pyramid. 29 Racist assumptions also remained central to the later versions of the Islamicist argu- ment, though they tended to be expressed in comparatively muted forms. Thus Smith, accepting the notion that Islam offered only a limited portion of revealed truth, suggested that it was "perhaps the nearest approach to [such truth] which the unprogressive part of humanity can ever attain in masses" (Mohammed, p. 249). Blunt doubted that even the more sophisticated forms of Islam would be suitable for blacks: "From the moor to the negro is but a step, but it is a step of race, perhaps of species" ("Future of Islam," p. 214). Thomson derided missionary efforts "to graft upon the low undeveloped mind of the negro the highest and most beautiful conception of Christianity, instead of teaching him something that he will comprehend" ("African Tribes," p. 184). Johnston similarly argued: "The savage, with his low-grade mind, is not capable of holding rightly the abstruse dogmas of the Christian faith." 30 Taylor's debt to anthropological racial theory for his notions about "higher" and "degraded" races is particularly clear in a piece of work unre- lated to the controversy. His Origin of the Aryans (1890) accepted the validity of craniometric and physiognomic data as a basis for generalizations about ra- cial "temperament," and it incorporated arguments for the differential adap- tation of races to particular environments, with whites unsuited for the torrid zones, and blacks unadapted to the temperate north. Perhaps most tellingly, he suggested strict limits to the possibility of race mixture. 31 In the context of the Islamicist debate, these biases led him to conclusions similar to those of Thomson and Johnston: for "the true negroes of Nigratia, whose cerebral de- velopment is far lower, the creed of Islam would, for the present, appear to be 28 Winwood Reade, "Burton's Mission to Dahome," Anthropological Review 2 (1864), 340. 29 On the continuities between mid-century and late-Victorian racism in anthropology, see Douglas Lorimer, "Theoretical Racism in Late-Victorian Anthropology, 1870-1900," Victorian Studies 31 (1988), 405-430. 30 "Are Our Foreign Missions a Success?" p. 482. Johnston reiterated this point, with an even more direct reference to "any race of purely Negro blood," in his later History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races (1899; rev. ed.

The influence of anthropological racism in such writing is clear. The stages of religious development which parallel the racial hierar- chy, while most explicit in Burton, also inform the other Islamicist argu- ments, and lead easily to the conflation of the two hierarchies. Thus Reade felt the African could be elevated, but "not to our own level - that, I fear, can never be - but to the level of those from whom they have fallen"; this level coincided with the demands of Islam (Savage Africa, pp. 535, 577-579). For Taylor the argument took the form of a mathematical metaphor: "In mathematics, the calculus is a higher and more potent method than the four rules of arithmetic. But to try and teach a child to differentiate and integrate before he has mastered simple addition, must inevitably end in failure. It is much the same with religious teaching" (Spectator, 22 October 1887, p. 1418). For Taylor, then, it was not a question of which religion was true, but of which was appropriate for the level of African social evolution. He located the two religions on different steps up the ladder of civilization and insisted that that ladder must be climbed one step at a time. The double hierarchy of the Islamicist argument in no way challenged Victorian orthodoxies about progress or the self-assured belief of the British in their own cultural superiority. But it offered a serious challenge to the mis- sionary. By positing an equation of states of knowledge with states of civiliza- tion, the Islamicists suggested the possibility that truth was not single, not absolute. In the more provocative formulations, the challenge was made ex- plicit. Thus Burton compared the revelations of Islam with those of Moses and Jesus, and found no difference ("El Islam," pp. 330-332). Blyden argued that "if the divinity of a religion may be inferred from the variety of races among whom it has been suffused, and the strength of its hold on them, then there is no religion that can prefer greater claims than Islam" (p. 277). And Blunt saw Islam as a step above "systems of purely human origin" (p. 8). To such a direct challenge, Victorian defenders of missionary Christianity felt obliged to respond. III To a large extent the missionary response was defensive in character. It was formulated through a series of reactions to hostile ideas: the CMS at- tacked the Anthropological Society in 1865, Smith's book in 1874, Blyden and then Taylor in 1887; MacColl wrote against the Pall Mall Gazette in 1877, against Taylor in 1887, and against Ameer Ali in 1895; Jessup and Hughes explicitly placed their works about Islam in the context of increasing public sympathy for the religion (Hughes, Notes, p. v; Jessup, p. 6). Defense VICTORIAN STUDIES 60</page><page sequence="11">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA at its simplest takes the form of denial. Opposing the argument that Islam was a force for progress, the missionary side insisted that it was static, if not re- gressive. Where Islamicists pointed out parallels between Islam and Christi- anity, missionaries stressed the differences. They disputed Taylor's figures, challenged his sources, countered his claims of good effects, and listed instead the bad. There was more to the missionary argument than mere negation, however. A consistent pattern is evident in the ways traditional arguments about Islam were reused as well as in the ways Islamicism was negated. Clearly the Islamicist position most disturbed the missionaries insofar as it ap- proached cultural relativism. Central to the missionary defense was a chal- lenge to the developmentalism employed by the Victorian social sciences. They countered with an alternative model of progress based on a set of abso- lute values that remain unchanged through time. This model informed mis- sionary assertions about the anti-Christian, vice-ridden, and unprogressive character of Islam. The theological arguments against Islam focused on three issues: the denial of divine sonship to Jesus and the resultant lack of any atonement process comparable to the Christian passion; the models for human behavior provided by Islamic accounts of God, and even more of Mohammed; and the mechanical quality of Islamic religious practice. 32 The three elements are in fact interlocked, with the issue of Christ's role at the center of the critique. The absence of atonement was precisely what made the distance between man and God which Christian critics attributed to Islam a problem. Similarly the focus on the human failings of Mohammed measured him against the standard of Jesus and found Mohammed wanting. The spiritual loss ascribed to Islam because its prophet was not divine in turn implied a religion that could not truly transform the human soul, thus the emphasis on Moslem practice as merely a system of external rituals. Because the religion was seen as only a matter of mechanical observances, it could not provide a basis for moral law or resist the human tendency toward sin already apparent, Islam's critics claimed, in the prophet's life. If the overt target of such a critique is Islam, the argument also aimed at forms of belief attributable to English Islamicists in particular and the new science in general. The emphasis on the centrality of Christ's mission, and thus on the direct intervention of God in human concerns, opposed any ma- terialistic account of human progress. MacColl disputed Taylor's view of 32 Since most of these arguments recur in almost all the anti-Islamic literature, only the clearest state- ments of any particular position will be cited. On the issue of divine sonship see "Oriental Churches," pp. 222-223; on the models provided by Mohammed and Allah, see MacColl, Eastern Question, pp. 243-249, and "Islam and Civilisation," pp. 554-556; on the mechanical character of Islamic observance see Hughes, Notes, pp. 64-73.

But an adult man, deprived of arms and legs, is not in a process of development" ("Islam and Civilisation," p. 548). Development, MacColl argued, was not mechanical, but required divine guidance and uncorrupted divine truths. He developed a similar argu- ment in his defense of the Nicene Creed against Spencerian and Darwinian doubters. 33 The insistence that moral law and religion were divorced in Is- lam, and that its characteristic vices arose out of its founder's human failings, asserted a single absolute truth in ethical conduct against anthropological suggestions that ethics were conditioned by culture, climate, or race. The por- trait of Islam as a system of mechanical observances without spiritual content provided a model for the Christian polemicists of what a purely mechanistic world would be like as well as what evils Islam would be unable to prevent. The assertion that Islam was inherently vice-ridden 34 had several uses in the debate. First, most simply, anti-Islamic polemics presumed the single, absolute character of moral truth. Because Islam lacked the theological grounding of (Christian) truth, it followed that Islam must encourage human evils in practice. Second, from a polemical point of view, the charges had shock value that served to render Islam even more definitively Other, to asso- ciate it with practices Victorians might find abhorrent and which even the polemicists had difficulty speaking directly about. Third, the idea that Islam, by tolerating vice, required little of its converts, provided a means by which Christian missionaries could rationalize its relative success among Africans. Finally, the argument dovetailed with that about Islam's unprogressive char- acter. If Islam demanded no moral improvement of its converts, then claims for Islam as a force for progress must be false. While obsession with Islamic vices might seem to dominate the mis- sionary side of the discussion, the central theme remained the denial that Is- lam could be a force for progress - either progress in itself, or progress toward Christianity. The anti-progressive argument took three distinct forms, though most critiques combined these forms. First, it was argued that Islam represented a regression, not an advance, over earlier systems. This argument explicitly answered those, such as Burton and Taylor, who saw it as a reform movement directed against decayed post-Christian Eastern religious forms. It not only denied a progressive role to historical Islam, but reinforced argu- ments for its immutability in the present. Further, denying it a historically progressive role reasserted yet again the singleness of moral progress and of re- vealed religion. Since the Christian revelation and its Western development 3 Malcolm MacColl, Christianity in Relation to Science and Morals: A Course of Lectures Delivered in Ripon Cathedral on the Nicene Creed (London: Rivingtons, 1889), pp. 10-39, 82-101. 34 Jessup, pp. 34-51; Muir, pp. 335-338; Arold, pp. 265-309. VICTORIAN STUDIES 62</page><page sequence="13">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA through the Reformation were seen as the progressive revelation of genuine truth, Islam could only be a late deviation from this path. Second, critics insisted that Islamic expansion necessarily meant dev- astation, destruction, enslavement, and depopulation instead of progress. Most obviously, this denied that Islam had been a force of progress in Africa. Missionary apologists made Islam not just non-progressive, but a negation of what progress "primitive" societies could achieve. In addition, the argument dovetailed with the assertion that Islamic conversion was always carried out by force. This in turn provided yet another justification for the relative failure of Christian missionary endeavors, while at the same time reasserting the in- sufficiency of Islam as a spiritual doctrine. Third, Islam was characterized as a static, immutable doctrine incapa- ble of change. This argument was rooted in several assumptions: that Islam was bound by the laws of the Koran, which claimed to constitute a final reve- lation; that its merging of religious and state power made it intolerant and re- sistant to change; and that its "nomadic" vision was of a fundamentally static world. Against the portrait of Islam as civilizing agent, then, the defenders of missionary Christianity insisted that the Moslem could not advance be- yond a certain limited point. They also insisted that Islam could not serve as a stepping-stone to Christianity. This view was reinforced by the assertion that Moslems were particularly resistant to Christian conversion, widely ac- cepted as fact by both sides (Muir, p. 522; Knox, "Our Missions," p. 698). At the same time, Moslem resistance to conversion provided yet another justifi- cation for Christian missionary failures. The defensive posture of the pro-missionary argument thus amounted to a multifaceted assault on the developmental arguments of the Islami- cists, with incidental rationalizations for the failures of Christian mis- sions. Declaring that "Islam is a crystallisation, not an organism," MacColl concluded that "it admits no development or growth" (Eastern Question, p. 243). As can be seen in "The Theory of Development," the CMS response to Bishop Colenso and the Anthropological Society in 1865, this argument was part of a broader rejection of scientific developmen- talism. Behind these defensive counterattacks was an entirely different vision of progressive development, grounded on Christian faith in a single moral and spiritual truth. In religious terms this truth was unveiled through a pro- gressive sequence of revelations of which Islam was not a part (on progressive revelation, see MacColl, Christianity, pp. 71-75). The further equation of Christianity and civilization meant that material progress must share that same single, linear progression. Islamic apologists in the West, by seeking to AUTUMN 1989 63</page><page sequence="14">Thomas Prasch confuse and to secularize the conception of progress, were thus cast as the foes of Christian progress and civilization. IV The tensions between the Islamicist and missionary sides emerge clearly over three strictly secular issues: polygamy, slavery, and empire. These focal points of contention reveal the ways in which the ideological divisions were manifested in policy disagreements at all levels of human society, from the domestic sphere to that of international politics. For both positions, the character of faith determined the character of social and political judgments. The defense of Islam as a religion entailed a range of justifications for Islamic codes regarding polygamy and the related issues of concubinage, di- vorce, and the place of women in society. At the provocative extreme, Bur- ton suggested that polygamy might offer advantages even to Europeans (Abeokuta, pp. 208-219). The more moderate argument developed by Burton and Reade was that polygamy was particularly fitted for African tribes, be- cause of their "primitive" state, their environment, or their racial proclivi- ties. Further, they emphasized Islam's role in limiting polygamy rather than its condoning the practice. 35 Later defenders of Islam continued to argue that polygamy was simply an alternative cultural form necessitated by environmental circumstances, and not a fundamental evil. Taylor had suggested in his initial address that polygamy, "with all its evils, has its counterbalancing advantages" (The Times, 8 October 1887, p. 7). He developed his position in more detail dur- ing his trip to Egypt, arguing that as levels of civilization rose polygamy as an institution naturally faded away (Egyptian Note-Book, pp. 39-47). But poly- gamy was the characteristic of Islam that most deeply offended Christian commentators. Muir wrote that the practices of polygamy and divorce "strike at the root of public morals, poison domestic life, and disorganize society" (pp. 521-522; see also Amold, pp. 265-275). By challenging the family, poly- gamy undercut the central unit in the Victorian Christian vision of order, the ground and model for all higher forms. The centrality of the family's role in the Victorian Christian vision can be seen in the range of evil its collapse would unleash. Jessup, for example, argues that polygamy "utterly destroys the sanctity and purity of the family, brutalizes the man and degrades the woman." It encourages "sensuality in its most beastly forms" and "uproots the family economy, order and discipline" (pp. 36-37). The concomitant degradation of women leads to their being kept "in seclusion or subjection" and to wife-beating (pp. 41, 44). Finally, it results in "gross immorality" including sodomy (p. 47). The defilement of the 35 Burton, Abeokuta, p. 208, "El Islam," pp. 326-329; Reade, Savage Africa, pp. 545-546, 555, 576, 581-583. VICTORIAN STUDIES 64</page><page sequence="15">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA family had consequences far beyond what happened behind closed doors, however. Christian ideology made the family the building block of social order. With its dissolution came also the replacement of industry by idleness, the sapping or poisoning of the body politic, and the descent of society into the degenerate despotism Christian commentators associated with Islam. Basic to this notion of family are the two fundamental principles of re- straint and proper order. The defenders of Islam were also engaged in a cultural critique of this model, or at least of the divide between ideal and practice. Tay- lor thus insisted that "the polyandrous English are not entitled to cast stones at the polygamous Mohammedans" (The Times, 8 October 1887, p. 7) and that "there was less vice in Cairo than in London, Paris, or Vienna" (Egyp- tian Note-Book, p. 47). With such assertions Taylor underlined the difference between Christian principles and realistic expectations, and by doing so un- dermined the practical usefulness of conservative Christianity. The proper place of women within the family was another concern, and the missionary advocates all concurred that Islam always led to the degra- dation of women (see, for instance, MacColl, Eastern Question, pp. 72-86; Jessup, pp. 38-46). That Victorian Christians could make such an argument given their own practice may strike us as odd, but the issue was of woman having a defined place within a social and familial order - as "helpmeet" to a husband. Islamicists for their part turned the proper-role argument against the missionaries, employing a "separate spheres" argument about a woman's autonomy within her own field as a defence of the harem. Christian missionaries had other reasons for finding defences of poly- gamy problematic. Polygamous practices were in fact a major obstacle to their own missionary endeavors, and Islamic tolerance for polygamy was widely conceded to be one factor in favor of Islamic expansion into the already poly- gamous cultures of central Africa. The possibility of revising missionary stan- dards to allow baptism of polygamous converts (but not new polygamous marriages) was a recurrent source of debate within missionary circles. 36 That in each case the CMS resolutely refused any compromise suggests h,w firmly the belief in the monogamous family was held. And in the arguments about the issue a recurrent theme was the call for restraint or sacrifice: Christianity was a higher creed than Islam because it required greater sacrifice and self- control from its converts. The importance of the issue of slavery becomes clear if we consider the context within which the Islamicist position, and in particular the racist assumptions underlying it, developed. Hunt's argument for classifying blacks as a lower species was not only about genetic categories, but also about mas- 36 On controversies over polygamy within the CMS, see Eugene Stock, History of the Church Mission- ary Society 3 vols.

Hunt contended that "the Negro is more humanised when in his natural subordination to the European," and "can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans" (JAS 2 [1864], xvi). For Hunt slavery was not only excusable, but necessary and inevitable. Both Burton and Reade supported Hunt's position. Asserting the "bald facts" of black inferiority and aversion to unforced labor, Burton justified slavery on pragmatic and developmental grounds (Gelele, pp. 136-139). Reade echoed the wage-slavery argument current in pro-slavery rhetoric and credited to the slave trade both Western progress and "the first spirit of enterprise in Africa" (Savage Africa, pp. 30-31, 289). Hunt shrouded his own position with the presumed objectivity of sci- entific fact, dismissing all criticism as moralistic sentimentality (AR 1 [1863], 390). Similarly C. Carter Blake, chairing the discussion before the Anthro- pological Society, expressed the "hope" that "there will not be introduced into this discussion any opinions of a political nature" (JAS 2 [1864], p. xxii). But the timing of Hunt's intervention was not politically neutral. Across the Atlantic a civil war was being fought, with black slavery very much at issue. The wealth of the English cotton industry had depended on black slave labor, and the dominance of English industrial interests ensured a sympathetic hear- ing for the southern states' pro-slavery cause. On the other side, slavery had long been a central, even defining issue for evangelicalism. The same religious spirit that gave rise to the missionary movement had been the major force behind the English antislavery cause. The majority of those challenging Hunt at either the British Association or the Anthropological Society were clergy, many with missionary experience. And the CMS position had long been clear: the slave trade was largely re- sponsible for the poverty of the African coasts, as well as for the increase in tribal warfare. In the years after the Civil War, and with the decline of the transat- lantic slave trade, missionary promotion of the antislavery cause increasingly focused on the slave trade within Africa itself. 37 The character of the anti- slavery mission was thus transformed, from an attack on a system in which European traders and planters participated to one in which both slaves and masters were outside the European system entirely. It had to be established both that internal African slavery was as much an evil as the transatlantic system, and that its suppression should be a concern of Europeans. The anti- slavery activists used a double argument to deal with this problem. First they insisted that Islamic domestic slavery was every bit as immoral and oppressive as the chattel slavery of the American plantation era. Second they argued that the slave "harvesting" carried on to support the system led to the devas- tation and destabilization of Africa. Tribal warfare, depopulation, and famine 37 See, for instance, The Slave-Trade of East Africa: Is It to Continue or Be Suppressed (London: CMS, 1868); "Selections from the Proceedings of Committee," Intelligencer, July 1888, p. 495. VICTORIAN STUDIES 66</page><page sequence="17">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA were linked to the continuing search for slaves (see, for example, Knox, "Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race"). On the other side, the Islamicist position was relatively strengthened, not only by the decline in popular antislavery sentiment after the resolution of the crises of the 1850s and '60s, but also by the removal of the divisive polygenetic argument from the anthropological debates of the later period. The political neutrality claimed by the pro-slavery anthropologists of the 1860s could be asserted with more ease later by those who would suggest that Islamic domestic slavery was something different, and less offensive, than the chattel slavery of the transatlantic trade. Thus the actual terms in which Tay- lor defended Islamic domestic slavery or the forced labor system of corvee in Egypt differed little in substance from those of Reade and Burton; he empha- sized the progress that had only been possible through forced labor, the contentedness of slaves with their condition, and the mild regime of the sys- tem (Egyptian Note-book, pp. 70-72, 77-79). A curious quirk of the slavery debate is that both sides, for rather dis- tinct reasons, sought to detach the slave issue from the European slave trade, insisting that slavery in Africa pre-existed European contact and continued without reference to it (see, for example, Burton, Gelele, pp. 136-139; Knox, "Rejoinder," pp. 722-723, 728). As part of the missionary argument about the character of African slavery, its African roots were used to suggest that its chattel character was intrinsic, that the oppressive nature of the system was more than just a feature of the interlude of the transatlantic trade. The Islamicists, however, employed the same point in an argument about cultural difference. If it was a system intrinsic to Africa, abolitionism amounted to a failure to understand another cultural system. Slavery was also crucial to the Islamicist critique of the moral vision of empire. The Islamicists attacked the central premise of missionary ideology from the time of Wilberforce and Livingstone by suggesting that contact with the West, far from being a force of advancement, was detrimental to Africa. The slave trade was the primary example of that contact; other forms of com- merce, however, also tended toward evil. Joseph Thomson put the argument most strongly: "What is a missionary here and there compared with a thou- sand agents of commerce? What is a Bible, or a baleful of useful goods, in op- position to the myriad cases of gin, the thousand guns, which compete with them? What chance has a Christian virtue where the soil is so suitable for Eu- ropean vice?" ("Results of European Intercourse," p. 348). The Livingstonian missionary ideal posited a trinity of civilization, Christianity, and commerce as indivisible components of a single missionary goal. The Islamicists sought to undermine such an argument by asserting those components could be separated. The Islamicist challenge to the mis- sionary ideal came at a particularly sensitive point, when the-linkage between Christianity and commerce was being challenged within missionary circles as AUTUMN 1989 67</page><page sequence="18">Thomas Prasch well. 38 Arguing that Islam was a civilizing force directly disassociated the no- tion of civilization from that of Christianity. But the attack on European commerce operated in a different way. Insisting that the general conse- quences of European commerce in Africa were detrimental for Africans was a way of forcing the missionary side to make the same disassociation, to deny its own ideological foundations. This thrust is clear in Taylor's mocking observa- tion that "the gospel of Free-trade in poisonous spirits cannot, in the case of the negro, co-exist with any other gospel .... It is our greed for gain, and our worship of the fetich of Cobden's shadow, which are the most insuperable ob- stacles of all to the progress of Christianity" (Spectator, 22 October 1887, p. 1419). The missions must choose, he suggested, between commerce and creed. Knox insisted that the missions had chosen: "The commercial theory has largely been abandoned" ("Rejoinder," p. 714; see also p. 736). Even in Knox's case, however, this proves disingenuous. Knox was quite willing to hope that imperial power could come to the aid of missionary zeal, since "any- thing which could tend to paralyze Mohammedan enterprise, with its un- utterable cruelties and abominations, ought to be welcomed by every one possessed of the most ordinary feelings of humanity" ("Rejoinder," p. 715). Missions ought to be concerned only with souls, he declared, but added: "If commerce or civilization can improve the condition of the Negro so much the better" (p. 736). In MacColl's case the ideology of free trade suffused even his justifications of the Nicene Creed. The wedding of Christianity and civilization was as absolute for him as the divorce between Islam and progress. What the missionaries seemed most to fear was an extension of empire divorced from the goal of Christianization. Indeed, the mission experience in India gave them good reason to fear such a shift in policy. Secularized empire building was urged by most of the Islamicists. Thus Reade saw no reason to let differences between Christians and Moslems get in the way of the material exploitation of Africa: "Let us abandon our absurd projects of converting Mussulmans; or rather let us convert them to our arts, our sciences, and our commerce. The interior of Africa is in the hands of the Mussulman. We have only to gain them as our allies, to gain entree to its mysteries and treasures" (Savage Africa, p. 585). Such an alliance would, in Reade's view, facilitate the eventual division of the continent between France and England. John- ston inverted the terms of the triad of commerce, civilization, and Christianity, 38 See Andrew Porter, "'Commerce and Christianity': The Rise and Fall of a Nineteenth-Century Missionary Slogan," Historical Journal 28 (1985), 597-621, esp. 616-619. Porter argues that the linkage of commerce and Christianity was always more tenuous than its predominance in mid-century missionary rhetoric would suggest, never particularly relevant in India, and short-lived in Africa. Para- doxically, Porter elsewhere argues that late-Victorian missionary writers increasingly accepted a linkage between Christian missionary endeavor and the expansion of English imperial rule in Africa; see "Anglican Missionary Expansion," pp. 350-352, 362; "Cambridge, Keswick, and Late- Nineteenth-Century Attitudes to Africa," Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 5 (1976), 5-7. In his comments on an earlier version of this paper, Porter suggested that the controversy gen- erated in the CMS by internal challenges to the missionary trinity could account for some of the intensity of their attacks on Taylor. VICTORIAN STUDIES 68</page><page sequence="19">WHICH GOD FOR AFRICA arguing that the missionary was only successful as the facilitator of eventual im- perial rule, "the preparer of the white man's advent" ("British Missions in Africa," p. 723; see also "Our Foreign Missions," p. 486). Taylor supported English occupation of Egypt on the grounds that it favored progressive forces within Islam (Egyptian Note-Book, pp. 21-29). If for most of the Islamicists the chief problem with empire was the moralistic rationalizations made for it, Blunt and Blyden turned the argument in an anti-imperialist direction. Blyden noted that "Mohammedanism, in Af- rica, has left the native master of himself; but wherever Christianity has been able to establish itself . . . foreigners have taken possession of the country" (p. 354). Blyden's promotion of Islam was part of his wider program of oppo- sition to European imperialism. Similarly, Blunt prophesied that Islam was "the spiritual inheritance of Africa . . . and as the intelligence of the races they convert shall have risen . . . the temporal inheritance too" shall rise (p. 48). In the triumph of Islam was the end of European empire, a prospect that Blyden and Blunt looked forward to. V This prospect of an end to empire, or of an end at least to the Chris- tian vision of empire, returns us to 1887 and the reasons why the debate set off by Taylor's talk was so contentious and so extended. Certainly a partial explanation for the furor can be found in Taylor's choice of an audience - a missionary conference, not the more neutral ground of the British Associa- tion or the pages of a liberal quarterly - and in the pleasure the principals derived from the controversy. But why would Taylor's position seem so par- ticularly threatening in 1887 - worthy of fourteen responses in the pages of the Intelligencer, while the 1865 Anthropological Society meetings only rated two? For the beginning of an answer we need go no further than the pages of the newspapers in which the argument was carried on. In October, the month the controversy was set into motion, papers also carried news of the expulsion of CMS missionaries from Uganda as a result of Arab influence; scattered and uncertain reports of Stanley's relief mission to Emin Pasha, an important missionary ally in East Africa; brief reports of British "pacification" missions on the Niger; in the Sudan, where memories of the Mahdist rising were still fresh, accounts of skirmishes with rebels; troubles in the Transvaal between Boers and Zulus, British and Boers; great-power negotiations over the future of Morocco; diplomatic debates between France and Britain over the occupation of Egypt. The world had become a more dangerous place for missionaries, and at the same time it had become substantially larger. In the wake of the Berlin Conference of 1884, the scramble for Africa was on in ear- nest. The unmapped territories of central Africa were rapidly coming under imperial rule, while missionary penetration remained concentrated on coastal AUTUMN 1989 69</page><page sequence="20">Thomas Prasch stations. The pace of imperial expansion increasingly outstripped that of mis- sionary endeavor, and the disequilibrium threatened in a new way the trinity of commerce, civilization, and Christianity. Furthermore, even most missionary defenders conceded that on one point at least Taylor was right: from about mid-century, a newly militant Is- lam had been engaged in competitive missionary activity, and in Africa Islam was winning. 39 The expansion of Islam and that of European empire were in fact more than coincidental; the destabilization of traditional religious and political structures brought about by increasing Western contact benefited Is- lamic missionaries. 40 Not only was Islam winning in terms of sheer numbers, but its conversions appeared more solidly grounded. Islam seemed to have less a problem than Christianity with relapses to "primitive" religion. And almost all sources concurred that Islam was cutting into Christian converts, but that almost no Moslems became Christians. Against the greater threat and greater challenge abroad, the mission- ary societies had to contend with crises in work force and funding, Anglican debates about Ritualism, and a changing theological justification for mission- ary work (see Porter, "Cambridge, Keswick," especially pp. 10-17, 24-28). The era of broad evangelical commitment was rapidly fading, and the mis- sions faced increasingly broadly based skepticism about the efficacy and cost of their efforts. Proponents of the missionary effort had no doubts about where the blame for this decline in commitment lay: in the overtly secular, anti-religious trends in the physical and social sciences, and in the "advanced" Anglicanism that sought to accommodate religion to the new science. 41 From such a perspective, Taylor's threat came not only in what he said, but in who he was: a canon in the Anglican church with advanced theo- logical views and an avocation for anthropology. The CMS held Taylor and those who shared his views responsible for the decline in missionary funding and staff. Knox went further to link Western liberal thinking to the rise of hostile receptions abroad, lumping Taylor into a list of those who "disparage Christianity, and try to bring it down to the level of one among many relig- 39 This consensus is accepted as well by many contemporary scholars.

But the evidence that Knox found horrifying - that people in the Islamic world were reading Darwin, Spencer, Strauss, and Renan - Taylor himself noted as evidence for Islamic progressivism (Egyp- tian Note-Book, p. 14). The missionary response to such critiques had a simple bottom line. As "An Old Supporter of Missions" wrote to The Times, "when one spoke slightingly of missions in the hearing of the great Duke of Wellington, he said they should look at 'the marching orders,' meaning the command of the Great Master" (7 November 1887, p. 13). With such orders, poor results or sharp competition did not matter. Despite equivocation, Taylor's position also had a simple bottom line: if the missions were indeed "futile" there was no reason to continue the endeavor. The compromise position that emerged between these extremes did more than make allowances to both sides; it in- corporated aspects from the premises of each to reformulate the idea of mis- sion activity in a way fitted to the new demands of empire. The middle position between Taylor and his critics can be traced in the contributions to the debate by R. Bosworth Smith, Johnston, Thomson, and Hughes. The rhetorical structures of their arguments were nearly identi- cal: each began by conceding most of Taylor's points, especially about the success of Islam and its role in advancing civilization in Africa; turned to the negative aspects of Islam, including polygamy, slavery, and a limitation on future progress; reasserted the need for Christian missionary work, based on the greater truth of Christianity; and closed with prescriptive suggestions for the renewal of missionary effort. Taylor's own later contributions to the de- bate took much the same form. All the prescriptive lists included the need to pitch the Christian mes- sage at a lower level, to take into account the lesser ability of Africans to under- stand. Most concurred that the Moslems must be considered potential allies. Most insisted that the missionary endeavor must be more in tune with native culture than it usually had been. Johnston alone argued for the continued linkage between Christianity and Western commerce. For the others, this connection was to be severed, as the root cause of the evils which had accom- panied European contact. Also severed, if missionary appeals were to be con- ditioned to African levels of culture, was any necessary connection between Christianization and civilization. The central shift in the compromise approach was the abandonment of the sacred trinity of missionary endeavor, the detachment of missionary work from the works of empire and trade. The shift was predicated on the ac- ceptance of two key elements in the Islamicist position: its racism and its developmentalism. This was balanced by an acceptance of the basic tenet that Christianity had the stature of absolute truth. By detaching the work of God from the work of Empire, the advocates of a middle way sought to secure AUTUMN 1989 71</page><page sequence="22">Thomas Prasch both. The disequilibrium between imperial and missionary expansion no longer mattered. The missionaries could pursue their slower work at their own rate. Empire could expand as rapidly as the competition between European powers for African territory seemed to require, and the missionary endeavor could catch up with the territorial expansion later. Missions continued to play a central role in the support and maintenance of empire - often, indeed, preced- ing effective colonial government in many areas. But now the Bible followed the flag, rather than the other way around. Such a middle ground perfectly suited the late 1880s, its imperial vision fitted for the scramble for Africa, its missionary ideal tailored to the decline of evangelical commitment. Most of the defenders of missions, however, moved toward no such middle ground. Their attacks on Islam continued largely unchanged into the twentieth century. 42 But the debate became increasingly one-sided and irrel- evant. The intensity of the controversy in 1887 depended on circumstances specific to that time: the wane of evangelical fervor, the institutionalization of the social sciences, the early years of the scramble for Africa. By the turn of the century the central issues had been decided: the map of Africa had been filled in with the colors of European empire, while the missionaries could only claim more limited outposts; and the anthropological conflation of racial and developmental hierarchies was firmly rooted in the textbooks and prac- tices of a more widely accepted social science. What the controversy that Taylor sparked in 1887 and the complexity of the response to it suggest to students of the Victorian period is that our simple categories are in need of revaluation. It will not do to argue, as Caimes does, that the dispute is simply between "conservative" critics of mis- sions who do not believe in the possibility of rapid change and "radical" mis- sionaries with faith in human possibilities (p. 212). Such a picture hardly fits the radical cultural critique engaged in by the Islamicists, or the conservative religious views espoused by the missionary societies. But neither will it do to simply reverse the terms. The links between missionary Christianity and the spread of imperial domination, one-sided commerce, and the destruction of indigenous cultures are links which cannot be disputed. In condemning those connections, however, we should be cautious about looking to the defenders of indigenous culture and the critics of imperialism as heroes. The Islamicist argument was rooted in extreme racism and, despite its approach to cultural relativism, remained firmly ethnocentric: Islam was an acceptable religion for 42 For late examples see James S.

On the other side, we should not too hastily resanctify the Christian missionary. The missionary movement was not without its own racism (see especially "Future of the Negro," p. 1615; Porter, "Cambridge, Keswick," pp. 26-28). Missionary writings regularly employed familiar racist rhetoric, espe- cially of the black as "child." The critics of missions, not letting their glass houses stop them from throwing stones, were quick to point this out. "What Christian missionary takes a negress to wife or sits with the negro wholly as an equal at meat?" Blunt asked. "Their relations remain at best those of teacher with taught, master with servant, grown man with child" ("Future of Islam," p. 215). As late as 1910 W. H. T. Gairdner, in a CMS publication, sug- gested, "It is not mere pride and prejudice that have forbidden the mixing of white with black or brown or yellow. It is gravely to be considered whether nature herself - and God is behind nature - has in the past blessed such mixtures" (The Reproach of Islam, p. 321). And it is worth noting that in all the controversy over Taylor's speech, few of his critics make his racism an issue. Nevertheless it cannot be denied that the harshest forms of racism arise on the Islamicist side, and the nearest approaches to arguments for racial equality on the missionary side. On the other hand, the most intolerant forms of ethnocentrism must be credited to the advocates of missions, an in- tolerance rooted in their certainty of truth. In the case of MacColl, who could denounce whole peoples as lustful and indolent on the basis of their faith, the distance between ethnocentrism and racism was small. Such judgments also fed popular jingoism. As Ameer Ali wrote in 1895, "I have no doubt that in the present state of feeling in England, [MacColl's] anathema against Islam has succeeded in the purpose for which it was designed, namely, to inflame still further the passions of the fanatical, perplex the wavering, and obscure the main issues in the minds of others." 43 But again, for all their denunciations of the consequences of Western contact with Africa, the Islamicists were guilty of a jingoism of their own. The Islamicist controversy reveals the complexity of even entrenched positions of belief and unbelief in the circumstances of expanding empire and declining evangelicism of the late nineteenth century. Aside from mere com- plexity, however, the dispute underlines the implication of religion within a wider social frame of reference. The debate about Islam was never only a de- bate about a religion or the lack of it. It was also, always, about the social realms within which faith must operate: race relations, social order, and the building of empire.
