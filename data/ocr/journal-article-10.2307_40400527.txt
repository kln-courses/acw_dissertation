<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHY OF VEBLEN'S ECONOMICS RANDOLPH H, LANDSMAN WAS the founder of pragmatism, Charles S. Peirce, who in- ducted the young Veblen into the golden realms of philosophy. Veblen had come to Baltimore from his native Wisconsin to do graduate work in philosophy at the newly established Johns Hopkins University. Peirce was giving courses in the new logic of science, as contained primarily in his essays of 1878, in which the principle of pragmatism had first been offered. The philoso- phy prevailing at the time was German Idealism, more specifically the subjective idealism of Kant. In fact, as Peirce tells us, he took the term "pragmatisch" from the Critique of Pure Reason, but of course gave it the new, or pragmatist twist in behalf of scientific method. Thus, when Veblen offered his first, philosophical essay for publication, it was on Kant. It was an appreciation of The Critique of Judgment, from the new, pragmatist point of view: theory and practice, logic and action, induction and experience, reflection and ethics, all were drawn to the relevancy of need in life and reality: Singularly as it may seem hardly any part of our knowledge except that got by induction is of any immediate use for practical purposes. For by induction alone can we reduce things to system and connection, and so bring particular things and events under definite laws of inter- action. (Journal of Speculative Philosophy, 1884.) Then, with the publication of Herbert Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy, American youth was once again influenced by the new philosophy from abroad, this time by the doctrine of Develop- ment out of England. John Fiske, to be sure, was the outstanding disciple, but there were others, including Veblen. The shift from Kant to Spencer, meant, primarily, the shift from metaphysics to science, from philosophy to biology, from biology to psychology 333</page><page sequence="2">334 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY and sociology. There need be no more talk in the new, or indus- trialized, capitalist America about the categorical imperative, the synthetic judgment a-priori, nor the Transcendental Analytic. Finally, came the momentous impact of Darwin's Origin of Species, the theory of evolution on the principle of natural selection in the struggle for existence. Veblen had come at last upon the very science and philosophy he needed for the purpose of his new interest, namely, economics. Darwinism would supply the organon for reconstructing that sci- ence, from the ground up, to provide the necessary system of eco- nomics most suitable to the new, industrialized, capitalist America. Accordingly, he raised the heretical question in his next essays, now devoted to the new interest: "Why is Economics Not an Evolution- ary Science?1' Classical economics he held, was vitiated by 1) ani- mism, 2) teleology, and 3) hedonism. These are to be found in Adam Smith as in Bentham, in Ricardo as in Mill. The way out lay pre- cisely in the direction of Darwinism, evolution, the methods of cumulative causation in science. Furthermore, all this economics was vitiated as well by the outmoded, archaic psychology of "asso- ciationism": the time had come for economics to assimilate the new psychology, the fundamental psychology out of our own William James: The later psychology gives a different conception of human nature. According to this conception, it is the character of man to do some- thing, not simply to suffer pleasure and pains through the impact of suitable forces. According to this view, economic activity is not ap- prehended as something incidental. The activity itself is the substantial fact of the process. Here was pragmatism come to provide the psychology of the new economics, or pragmatist psychology to provide the foundations of institutional economics- according to Veblen. As over against the "animism" and "teleology" of classical eco- nomics. Veblen insisted that evolution, the economic life process, and cumulative causation were the methods of science, entire. Why should economics lag behind in face of the fruitful lessons of the kindred sciences of anthropology and psychology, in particular? Darwinism, in short, must provide the clue and method, basically.</page><page sequence="3">veblen's economics 335 Now Veblen was ready to grant, that John Stuart Mill had em- ployed scientific method in his economics. This was re-enforced by his System of Logic, in which the canonical methods of induc- tion were set forth, in specific detail. But all this was vitiated, he thought, by the outmoded psychology of "associationism." Eco- nomics must be reconstructed, then, on the joint grounds of Dar- winism plus pragmatism. It should be added that Veblen did not resort to Peirce in these new efforts toward the reconstruction of economics. For Veb- len had succeeded in procuring a post at the newly-opened Uni- versity of Chicago, and it was there that he came upon the faculty of Philosophy, with psychology as uppermost. This meant Mead and Dewey, Angeli and Tufts, all of whom were plumping for functional psychology, for the psychology of pragmatism out of James, as indicated. The very same year Dewey published his School and Society, or pragmatic education, Veblen published his first book, The Theory of the Leisure Class- in 1899. It was his pioneer work in the direction of what he termed "evolutionary economics," or as it is known today, institutional economics. II It remained for Veblen to follow through with his critique of Marxian, or socialist economics. Marxism, Veblen pointed out, is primarily the philosophy of materialism, of the materialist conception of history. Hence it is not static, formalist nor taxonomic, since it is grounded in the logic of process. Moreover, it possessed a doctrine of evolution, linked to the concept of class struggle. Veblen writes: The comprehensive system of Marxism is comprised within the scheme of the Materialist Conception of History. . . . The social order takes its form through the class struggle, arçd the character of the class struggle at any given phase of the unfolding development is deter- mined by "the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange." Nevertheless, Veblen objects on two main grounds. First, it is linked to Hegel, not to Darwin. Secondly, it is teleological, with its</page><page sequence="4">336 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY end or perfect term of socialism: it does not move in the direction of Darwinian "cumulative causation." According to Veblen, then, there is gross disparity between Marx- ism and Darwinism, between dialectic and evolution, between meta- physics and science, between materialism and naturalism (pragma- tism). Veblen writes, with reference to Marxism: The dialectic of the movement of social progress, therefore moves on the spiritual plane of human desire, not on the (literally) material plane of mechanical and physiological stress, on which the develop- mental process of brute creation unfolds itself. It is a sublimated mate- rialism, sublimated by the dominating presence of the conscious human spirit. Thus the issues are clearly, sharply drawn. Marxism is Hegel- ian, Veblen is Darwinian; Marxism is dialectical, Veblen is evolu- tionary; Marxism is materialism, Veblen is pragmatism; Marxism is socialist economics, Veblen is institutional economics. In the light of the above, it is difficult to follow J. A. Hobson, the emi- nent English economist, when he claims that Veblen is Socialist. Hobson says: Veblen's criticism of Marx's economics by stressing their differences has perhaps tended to conceal their resemblances. Both are economic determinists . . . both qualify the economic determination of history. . . . Both hold the doctrine of conflict of interests between an owning class and a producing class. (Veblen, by J. A. Hobson: Chapter IV, "Veblen's Socialism," p. 66.) In somewhat similar vein, Max Lerner in America offers the fol- lowing resemblances: Both of them- Marx, Veblen- contain a basic emphasis on the eco- nomic factors of history; both stress the relation between technology, class relations, power and ideas; both are anti-capitalist in animus while they lay claim to scientific validity; both look forward to a revolutionary overturn of one form or another- in Marx's case pro- letarian, in Veblen's vaguely syndicalist. . . . But while in Marx's case the idea of process was derived from Hegel, in Veblen's case it was derived from Darwin.</page><page sequence="5">veblen's economics 337 Whether it be the English Hobson or the American Lerner, there is no realization here of the philosophy involved. For the irreconcilable conflict is between materialism and pragmatism, be- tween historical materialism and instrumentalism, pervasively through all the various fronts of economics, politics, history, psy- chology, and philosophy. This should be borne in mind, more specifically in the American scene, for such efforts appear from time to time, as in the cases of William English Walling, Max Eastman, Sidney Hook, and James Cork. HI The rise and influence of functional psychology in America bear directly upon the basic issues of philosophy involved. In the first place, it was Veblen who sought to reconstruct economics from the bottom up with the help of this new psychology. In the second place, it has been used by our pragmatists time and time again as a weapon against Marxism. And, finally, this very psy- chology stands out as the bulwark of current philosophical attacks on Marxian socialism. Thus, the pragmatist psychology of be- haviorism is the basic tool of our pragmatists in their attacks on the philosophy of materialism, of Marxian materialism. William James, the pioneer, sought to build a new psychology on the basis of Darwinism: a psychology as a natural science. In consequence, he emphasized the biological nature of conscious- ness, the biological basis of habit, the biological basis of con- ception, and so on. All these phases he regarded as functional, in the sense that they were oriented to the struggle for existence, man's very survival as a species. Never in all his new science had James mentioned the specific society man lived in, the particular economy at its base, nor the existence of social classes. It was a psychology looking to biology, as if man were never confronted with such economic, political and social problems. For example, James regarded thinking as a psychological proc- ess, primarily, oriented to the biological and the functional, in the continuing struggle for existence. Thinking was relevant to need, and hence mental processes had adjustment value. Thinking has significance for life, the day-to-day problems that confront the in- dividual. In this manner, James sought to devoid thinking not</page><page sequence="6">338 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY only of its formalist, or logical, matrices, but also of its relation to society, its economy and polity and history. Here, then, was pragmatist psychology come to explain the nature of human thinking, as biological and functional, as instru- mentalist and pragmatic. Furthermore, the book itself, The Prin- ciples of Psychology, had no internal evidence whatsoever con- cerning America, least of all that all this psychology was to function in a capitalist economy. Thinking was to be specific and concrete and particular, but totally unmindful of the brute fact that we were living here and now, then and there, in a particular, specific type of economy and society. In a peculiar sense, the psychology of prag- matism was the psychology of human nature, everywhere, and in- discriminately. The fact is that this psychology shows definite social origins and objectives. Taking its rise from the conditions and problems at the time, socially and economically, it sought to buttress the status quo, by aid of the naturalistic, or evolutionary biology, which it adopted. It was, more definitely, an American product, a prod- uct of American social conditons, primarily. No such psychology, no behaviorism of this kind appeared elsewhere- whether in Ger- many, France or even Great Britain. When Veblen came to his new economics, in America once again, he resorted to this very science, this pragmatic psychology. It was used as a lever in an attempt not so much to demolish the classical economics as to do battle against socialist, or Marxian economics. The biology of Darwin was coupled with the kindred psychology of behaviorism to cross swords with materialism. It was the prop of pragmatism, as we have seen, against the possible incursion of the materialist philosophy, with its pendant of Socialism. That is why, too, Veblen never mentioned the psychology inherent in the materialism of Marx, the relation between class and habit, between class and thinking, between class and memory, all on the materialist basis. Instead, he trotted out his psychology of instincts, whether the latter be of habit or use and wont or "workmanship" and "idle curiosity." For instance, Veblen regarded the "machine process" of mod- ern times as responsible for the "mechanist thinking" fallen into by the worker tending the machine. "The final term of the work-</page><page sequence="7">veblen's economics 339 er's thinking, his habitual thinking, is mechanical efficiency, me- chanical cause-and-effect." Furthermore, Veblen held that "proc- esses of thought, methods of apperception, and sequences of reason- ing" are the effects of the machine-process. In other words, thinking is functional, behavioristic, and pragmatic, in terms of the machine- process. On this psychological basis, Veblen draws a sharp dichotomy within employment: 1) pecuniary, or business, and 2) industrial, or mechanical. These induce corresponding differences of modes of thinking. The former is anthropomorphic, conventional, and the other is matter-of-fact, cause-and-effect. One is conservative, the other is relatively less so. In short, Veblen's psychology adheres closely and solely to the present, the age of the machine, the age of business and industry under capitalism. He never introduces the historical fact of the rise of capitalism out of feudalism, nor the kind of thinking appearing, historically, in this social con- tinuum. The processes of thinking is usually referred to as either deduc- tive or inductive. According to Veblen's viewpoint, there is no discussion whatsoever of the relation between the machine-process to these modes of logical thinking. In consequence, he does not see that thinking under capitalism differs materially from thinking under feudalism. For the advance has been from deduction to induction, or from formalism to experiment. In the subsequent shift from capitalism to socialism we may expect the mode of think- ing to change once again. All this bears on Veblen's analysis in terms of the machine-process, socially and logically. And it is here that the psychology of the worker appears in quite different perspectives from Veblen's. With the change in social control there comes a concomitant change in the psychology of thinking, to be sure. The psychology, however, is always tethered to a logic of thinking, too, as we find so clearly manifest in the philosophy of pragmatism. Pragmatist psychology carries with it the instrumentalist logic of thinking- as set forth by Dewey, in particular. The psychology of the think- ing-process of the machine age is, in this sense, behaviorist, whereas its logic is instrumentalist. For both are offshoots and instruments of capitalism- whether of business or of industry. Under a social-</page><page sequence="8">340 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ist society, machines and the machine-process will still be in op- eration, but the whole set-up of the economy and polity will be different. It follows that behind this new machine-process, the order of thinking will be neither behaviorist in psychology nor instrumentalist in logic. This is the fuller significance of Marxian materialism, the dialectic psychology and the dialectic logic. As a pragmatist in his philosophy, it could not be expected that Veblen should think in terms of such materialist psychology and logic, such dialectics: rather is he true to type as Darwinian, pragmatist, and behaviorist. Dorfman, one of the leading authorities on Veblen, attempts a distinction between pragmatism and modern science. He regards Veblen as being opposed to pragmatism. Dorfman says: Veblen declared that modern science is not directed to practical ends. . . . Pragmatism inhibits and misdirects scientific inquiry. It is the ideal of all business men as well as the politician. (Thorstein Veblen and His America, p. 266.) Misinterpretations of pragmatism are frequent enough, but there is no doubt that the pragmatism of Peirce no longer is repre- sentative of the philosophy in question today. Rather it follows along the lines of the thinking of James, Dewey, and Mead. In consequence, if Dorfman means that Veblen never accepted the 'Vulgar" interpretation of this philosophy, he is correct, indeed. But at the same time this does not mean he gave up his psychology of behaviorism, nor yet his logic of induction, or experimental logic. It would be better to link Veblen with Mead, the pioneer of what the latter called "social behaviorism," as applied to history, sociology, and psychology proper. More recently, John S. Gambs, in his references to Veblen, tries to make him out to be a Hegelian, a dialectician. Gambs says: At critical points, Veblen gave tacit recognition of dialectical prin- ciples rather than to evolutionary principles. The polarity in his psychology is a unity of opposites. He also recognizes the "negation of negation." (Beyond Supply and Demand, p. 83.) In the very same breath, Gambs speaks of Veblen as a Gestaltist,</page><page sequence="9">veblen's economics 341 on the one hand, and as a logician of the "hypothetico-deductive" method, on the other. IV Veblen belonged to the 19th century, basically. For reasons not far to seek, Veblen had arrived at an arrested stage of develop- ment, as if he would not go forward with relativity and quantum theory, with all of logistics, or symbolic logic, nor with the psychol- ogy of psycho-analysis and Gestalt. Was it that the Darwinian ob- session persisted? Or was it rather that Veblen could not go for- ward with the Marxian dialectic, especially in connection with the rise of Socialism in the Soviet Union? Having moved onward and forward from Kant to Darwinism, initially, why could he not again make the step from pragmatism to materialism? On the American scene, we were confronted, first, with World War I. Veblen's position here was definitely on the side of the Allies as against Germany. In fact, he went to great lengths to show that Germany was a "dynastic state," an "imperialist state," and a "militarist state." On the other hand, in striking contrast, he regarded England, Great Britain, as a "commonwealth" of free, equal and "ungraded" men. There, the citizen is a subject of the state, but this relation of subjection is a personal relationship of mutual rank between two persons. Here, once again, is a com- monwealth given to democracy, following the principle of live and let live, in effect. So Veblen thought in 1915. Two years later, he speaks of "the current war," with Germany taking the initiative, "precipitated in response to the urgent popular aspiration." Such a philosophy of the state proceeds essentially without any philosophy of his- tory, and hence is pragmatist, once again. Whether it be war or peace, Veblen pursues the argument in terms of psychology, basi- cally, the pragmatist psychology. Once again, he resorts to con- demning Marxism, the materialist conception of history, on the ground that it issues, consistently, from Hegel and Hegelian dia- lectic, and not from Darwinism, the method of cumulative causa- tion: The disparity between Marxism and Darwinism is shown in the character assigned to the class struggle by Marx and Engels. The</page><page sequence="10">342 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY struggle is asserted to be a conscious one, and proceeds on a recognition by the competing classes of their mutually incompatible interests with regard to the material means of life. ... As regards the tenability of the doctrine, it is to be added that it is quite out of harmony with the later results of psychological inquiry. V It remains to say a word or two how all this doctrine of Veb- len's works itself out toward a philosophy of education, as for in- stance in his Higher Learning in America, first published in 1918. It should be recalled, too, that Veblen was one of the founders of the New School for Social Research- along with Beard, Dewey, Alvin Johnson and Wesley C. Mitchell. The book itself purports to be "A Memorandum on the Conduct of the Universities by Busi- ness Men." The specific universities he knew directly were those of Michigan, Missouri, Cornell, Yale, Chicago, and Johns Hopkins. First and foremost, Veblen sees the university as an institution for the quest of knowledge. This involves not only scientific in- quiry, but also the proper instruction of students toward such a quest. Secondly, the university has its place in modern civiliza- tion, its quest for knowledge and its scientific inquiry. Finally, knowledge itself is tied up with the instinct of "idle curiosity," which seeks knowledge, impersonally, as an end in itself. A second factor is the "instinct of workmanship," which provides the basic values of truth and certitude, in connection with such knowledge. Courses of study, therefore, no matter whether they be in the natural or social sciences or humanities and mathematics, must be in terms of these basic values of the university with respect to knowledge and learning. Veblen's critique reduces itself to the charge that universities are controlled by and for the interests of business, the pecuniary culture and pecuniary values. Under the circumstances, neither knowledge nor scientific inquiry is the goal and objective; on the contrary: The fact remains that the modern civilized community is reluctant to trust its serious interests to others than men of pecuniary sub- stance, who have proved their fitness for the direction of academic af- fairs by acquiring, or by otherwise being possessed of considerable wealth.</page><page sequence="11">veblen's economics 343 It is due for the greater part to the high esteem currently accorded to men of wealth who have succeeded in business, quite apart from any special capacity shown by such success for the guardianship of any in- stitution of learning. This is the situation, as Veblen sees it, and hence he suggests the remedy be "the abolition of the academic executive"- the Presi- dent of the University, and the "abolition of the governing Board of Trustees," or business control. Once this is achieved, higher learning in America would follow through towards its basic ob- jectives of knowledge and learning. The university is primarily a medieval institution, Veblen says, under the auspices of Christian theology, whether it be at Paris, Oxford or Cambridge» On the learning and knowledge fronts, it is bound to the formal logic of Aristotle, the ancient-idealist logic of the syllogism. With the rise of modern industry and science, the university changes more particularly along secular, scientific lines. For instance, its logic now includes induction, experimental method, and laboratory work. In America, our original universities-as col- leges-sought to follow along such European lines, as a mixture of the theological, the legal and the medical. Finally, there came the shift to capitalism with its direct need for science and culture as pragmatic and functional. When Veblen wrote, he concentrated on the direct observation of the universities in their control and administrative nature, which he imputed to the 'business man/ But he never discussed the chang- ing nature of the institution from feudalism to capitalism, and still less from the present toward the future. The analysis, therefore, is pragmatist, with the focus upon the here and now, the cross-section of the present, the nature of the institutional externals. A theory of education implies a theory of the state, and we have already noted Veblen's weakness in this respect. The university of yesterday was geared to the feudal state, and hence was scholastic, theological, and formalistic. The current university, likewise, is in conformity with the newer state, the capitalist or bourgeois set- up. Hence its education is empirical, scientific, pragmatic, capital- istic. In either case the courses of study are aimed toward the specific</page><page sequence="12">344 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY objective of the state, behind which is the particular economic sys- tem. Whether it be Harvard or Yale, Cornell or Chicago, to take the universities Veblen knew directly, the common denominator is not so much the administration by business men, as rather the maintenance and perpetuation of the bourgeois, or capitalist values, all along the line. It would seem, for instance, that a neutral and colorless subject like logic would show no definitive social, eco- nomic values, as if it were totally removed from the status quo, and were objective, impartial and scientific. And yet, if we examine the kind of logic taught in the universities of capitalism, we discover that it is not Aristotle nor Bacon nor Mill, but rather the highly sophisticated mathematical logic, or logistics, with its to-do about axiom-postulate systems. This is the end of the line, as capitalism reaches its terminus and close. A student trained in such logic need no longer be concerned with the present or the future- rather is he safe and secure in the confines of an atavistic formalism, "true of all possible worlds." The philosophy of education regarded as most advanced in Veblen's time was that of his colleague, John Dewey. Here was progressive education with its 1) philosophy of democracy, 2) its pragmatist psychology, and 3) its instrumentalist logic. In 1918, when Veblen's book was published, Dewey had already published his principal in education, Democracy and Education. Veblen seems never to discuss these ideas, either in connection with his own book or with Dewey's. However, if we put the two books side by side, we may readily see the nature of the pragmatist philosophy, its con- tribution to going beyond traditional, or received education in America. Neither thinker went along with capitalism all the way: each had certain criticisms and misgivings. Both were devoted to reconstruction, toward a new social order and a new education. And yet neither could accept the philosophy of materialism, the outlook of socialism, the functions of dialectical thinking. Instead, they sought to stress the meaning of Darwinism as basic, the doc- trine of evolution in terms of natural selection, the new psychology geared to the genetic, the functional, and the experimental. The result was a philosophy of education, quite opposed to feudalism, and idealism, on the one hand, and to socialism, or materialism, on the other. Somewhere in between lay the clue and objective,</page><page sequence="13">veblen's economics 345 in behalf of a liberal or liberalist philosophy, most suitable to a 'modified capitalism." Veblen thus represents a transition figure in philosophy, eco- nomics, psychology and education. As a thinker he belongs to the period between the decline of capitalism and the rise of socialism. He saw, indeed, many phases of the corrosion of capitalism, but still clung to the hope of two "instincts" of man, workmanship and idle curiosity. His recourse to Darwinism was to the narrowly biological; his recourse to psychology was to the behavioristic. In either case, he failed to move forward and beyond both his biology and this psychology, for reasons already given above. And in education he could see, most clearly, the menace of business control, but never moved beyond that to realize that a new social order was demanded, so that we might move to a new education beyond pragmatism. Minus a theory of the state, a theory of history, Veblen was obliged to remain immured within the present: he had no clear-cut view of the future, of the very future he most desired for humanity. Thus, at present Veblen stands out as a 'museum piece,' seized upon by nostalgic socialists, who long for the vitriolic acids to be poured upon capitalism, rather than move forward, bravely and courageously in the conviction that the philosophy toward the im- mediate future of man, entire, is none other than Marxism.
