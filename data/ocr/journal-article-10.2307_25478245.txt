Reviewed by Christina A. Conlee, Texas State Univer sity, San Marcos. For years the Nasca lines have stirred imaginations and led to many fantastical explanations of these images that were created on the desert floor in the Nasca region of south coastal Peru. In the 1940s, pioneering research was begun by Maria Reiche who recorded and mapped many of the geoglyphs located on the plain (pampa) that divides the northern and southern Nasca drainage. Reiche proposed that the lines were astronomical and calendrical in nature, and that they formed an enormous astronomy book. However, since Reiche's study, as Karsten Lambers points out in this new book, most research has been aimed at explaining the geoglyphs and not recording them (p. 27). Lambers' work is the first since Reiche's that details a significant number of newly documented geoglyphs (over 1,500), and he provides analysis and interpreta tion of this impressive database. His study focuses on the Palpa region of the northern Nasca drainage, an area where geoglyphs had not previously been systematically studied. Lambers' research was part of a larger project (SLSA) directed by Markus Reindel, Johny Isla, and Armin Grim, a multidisciplinary and international pro ject aimed at studying the Nasca culture. The geoglyphs were studied using high-resolution aerial images cou pled with field observations. 3D models and 2D maps were created along with detailed descriptions of each geoglyph. This data was then entered into a GIS for analysis. The results are a comprehensive study that will be of much use to researchers and will serve as a model for conducting future studies on the geoglyphs. Lambers set out to test the recently formed hypoth esis that views the geoglyphs within an Andean cultural concept in which they were sacred spaces that were cre ated and maintained by social groups, and on which rit uals were performed related to mountains, water, and fertility. The Andean model was tested using the sys tematically collected data and the results are presented in this book. Chapters 1 and 2 are an introduction to the lines and the study. Chapter 3 summarizes previous work on the geoglyphs and outlines the Andean model. Chapters 4 and 5 detail the methodology of the project and explain how the Palpa geoglyphs were documented. Documentation involved taking new aerial photos of the region and Lambers' gives a step-by-step account from flight planning to the production of 3D models. In Chapter 6 the archaeological analysis is presented and it forms the heart of the book. Lambers focuses on 639 of the most fully documented geoglyphs. His analy sis involved developing a typology of geoglyphs, the chronology of their use, activities associated with them and their spatial context. All of these were investigated to look for patterns and then evaluated in terms of the Andean model. It was established that the majority of the geoglyphs fell into the geometric class with the most common types being straight lines, followed by trape zoids and U shapes. Few anthropomorphic, zoomor phic, or representational geoglyphs were found, types that are common on the well-known pampa. Lambers concludes that the first geoglyphs were constructed dur ing the late Early Horizon (ca. 400 B.C.) and had their roots in the petroglyphs of earlier times. The majority date to the Nasca culture, with a fluorescence in Early Nasca with continued use until the early Middle Hori zon (ca. A.D. 800). Unfinished geoglyphs helped to doc ument the construction process, and Lambers proposes that the requirements of construction suggest special ists with special knowledge and authority who initiated and guided construction (p. 96). He found that geo Latin American Antiquity 19(4), 2008, pp. 475-477 Copyright ? 2008 by the Society for American Archaeology 475</page><page sequence="2">476 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 4, 2008] glyphs were constructed in complexes and they were almost constantly being constructed, maintained, and modified (p. 98). In terms of activities associated with the geoglyphs, most of the lineal ones have compacted areas, suggesting they were walked on frequently; how ever, other types such as trapezoids, and figures on hill sides, show limited evidence of compaction. The types of ceramic vessels associated with the geoglyphs (including whole broken pots) suggest food and drink consumption. Small stone structures found with some geoglyphs were excavated and they may have been used for offerings. High wooden posts were erected near some of these structures that were likely used for sight ing the geoglyphs across the flat landscape. One of the strengths of this project was that it involved regional settlement survey, in addition to the recording of geoglyphs, so for the first time the rela tionship between archaeological sites and the lines were considered in-depth. Maps were generated for each time period to study the relationships between sites and geo glyphs, and cost surface and viewshed analyses were conducted using GIS. Interestingly, Lambers found no correlation between geoglyphs and settlement patterns. There was, however, a high degree of intervisibility between geoglyphs and between geoglyphs and the sur rounding area, which supports the idea that the activi ties associated with them were meant to be seen, and that they were a type of stage (p. 118). Chapter 7 con tains a discussion of the Andean model and Lambers concludes that the archaeological data generally fit the model but that they corroborate only some aspects of it. Chapter 8 summarizes the results and conclusions of the study. One of the most striking conclusions is the uni formity of the geoglyphs in time and space over a period of 1,000 years. The stability of this complex is remark able given the dramatic shifts in political organization and local society. Accompanying the manuscript are ten maps and a DVD. The DVD contains two databases: one of infor mation collected in the field and another of data from the archaeological and GIS analysis. There is also an impressive video of a virtual flight through the 3D model that really gives a sense of the scale and landscape of the geoglyphs. Lambers' book and the supplementary material are a great resource for all archaeologists work ing on the south coast and those interested in the pre history of the region. They will also be useful to scholars who use, or wish to use, photogrammetry and GIS in their research. Detailed recording of the Nasca geo glyphs is a critical project because modern development in the region, along with natural erosion, threatens to destroy them. There are questions that remain unan swered regarding the Nasca lines, and the geoglyphs in other parts of the region have not yet been adequately studied. Lambers' and the SLSA team are continuing their research, and given the success of the first phase of the project, and the analysis presented here, I look forward to seeing their future work.</page></plain_text>
