NISBET Werke und Briefe in drei Banden. By JAKOB MICHAEL REINHOLD LENZ. Edited by SIGRID DAMM. 3vols. Leipzig: Insel. I987. 786pp.; 958 pp.; 994PP. DM58 the set. This is the nearest thing to a complete edition of the works of Lenz that we possess and will prove of great benefit to the study ofLenz's work, a study that has been held back by the absence of a full and reliable version of the source material. Up to now we have had to rely primarily on two editions, the two-volume Werke und Schriften edited by Britta Titel and Hellmut Haug (Stuttgart, I966-67) and the five-volume Gesammelte Schriften of Franz Blei (Munich and Leipzig, 909--I3). The former is more accurate and includes notes, but the selection of texts is severely limited. The present edition contains several important texts not included in the Werke und Schriften, and even some not included in either edition, such as Uber die Soldatenehen; it also includes letters to and from Lenz, a few more from Lenz than in the edition by Karl Freye and Wolfgang Stammler, 2 vols (Leipzig, 1918), and a rather smaller selection of the letters to Lenz. This is, however, a 'Leseausgabe' and makes no claim to be a complete critical edition. There are a small number of texts which are unfortunately not included: above all, prose works from the later period of Lenz's life, such as Urganda, Uber Delikatesse der Empfindung, and Empfindsamster aller Romane. And where different or draft versions exist, the reader is, as in the Werke und Schriften, usually offered only samples of the alternative versions. Thus the student of Der Hofmeister must turn to the parallel-text edition by Michael Kohlenbach (Basel, 1986), and we can only deduce from the notes to Die Soldaten that the Mariane of the text (manuscript version) is the character more widely known as Marie (from the first printed edition). In all texts the orthography is modernized, although the editor has consulted the original manuscript where possible. Although the scholar awaiting a historical critical edition will still feel that not all his needs have been met, such editorial decisions can no doubt bejustified in terms of a good usable edition at a good price which can only help to make Lenz more widely accessible. All texts are provided with notes, and these are generally more helpful than those of the Werke und Schriften. The edition is completed by a biographical essay by Sigrid Damm in which she attempts to reconstruct the inner logic of Lenz's career as the semi-conscious assertion of values contrary to those of the dominant tradition represented by Goethe, rather as she did in her Vogel, die verkiinden Land (Berlin, I985). In general, the production of these volumes is of a high standard, and one is grateful that physically they will be able to survive the regular use which they deserve; the number of printing errors appears to be small. This edition is likely to be the standard edition of Lenz's works and letters for some time to come. (A 'Lizenzausgabe' is published by the Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, at DM 158.) UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM DAVID HILL 'Einefast magische Anziehungskraft'. Goethes 'Wahlverwandtschaften' und die Chemie seiner Zeit. BYJEREMYADLER. Miinchen: Beck. I987. 260pp. DM48. In this absorbing, closely-written book we encounter several of the dominant tensions of eighteenth-century intellectual and social life: between ancient views of cosmic harmony that argued for a parallelism between macrocosm and microcosm, Reviews 247</page><page sequence="2">Reviews and newer views seeking to draw sharp distinctions between physics and meta- physics, between alchemy and the new empirical chemistry, and between magical and mechanical models of human behaviour. The way we understand the end of the eighteenth century, as the moment when a medieval world picture crumbled and our modern picture began to take shape, is a crucial factor in our present conscious- ness. The search that began then for new models of man-made harmony to replace or coexist with older religious systems is still with us, our answers as politically divisive as ever. Jeremy Adler's work, an exploration of the web of relationships within the fictive world of Die Wahlverwandtschaften in the light of Goethe's broader scientific interests in the working of affinities within nature as a whole, is a most useful contribution to this discussion. The author suggests that his work should be seen, following Benjamin's model, primarily as that of a palaeographer, scrupulously uncovering origins as a basis for deciphering their import. So he begins with a survey of discussions of the hypo- thetical 'ruling idea' of the novel. Goethe himself claimed that the work could be seen as a symbolic representation of social relations and the conflicts to which they gave rise. But he also acknowledged the density and incommensurability of myth- making and repudiated the notion that the core of a literary work consisted of some kind of rational, paraphrasable 'idea'. Over the past two centuries many critics have ignored such warnings and doggedly persisted in searching for a unitary 'idea', while others have emphasized the complexity and ambiguity of the work and rejected attempts to treat fiction as a box with a single key. Dr Adler's own aim is unitary: by exploring the literal and figurative associations of the title, first within chemical and hermetic writings known to Goethe and then within the novel itself, he hopes to show the centrality of the concept of elective affinity within Goethe's thinking as a whole. The second chapter traces the history of the idea of chemical affinities from theories of cosmic sympathy developed by Anaximander, Pythagoras, Theophras- tus, and Plotinus down to writings by Paracelsus, della Porta, and Kenelm Digby, and hence into Goethe's own neo-Platonic sentiments in Faust I and his early poetry. Adler points out that Bacon first introduced the notion of 'election' to describe attraction: 'When one body is applied to another, there is a kind of election to embrace that which is agreeable, and to exclude or expel that which is ingrate.' With the rise of mechanical chemistry, theories of occult forces were frowned on. Robert Boyle insisted that morals and politics should be kept out of 'explications of corporeal nature' and argued that 'affections of intelligent beings', such as amity and enmity, should not be applied to discussions of inanimate beings. But the tendency to link animate to inanimate bodies by a web of analogy was too deeply entrenched to be easily uprooted. So much was still unknown, both about cosmic forces such as gravity and about individual motivations and their biochemical, social, and psychological determinants. As Newton conceded in the famous queries appended to his Opticks: 'Life and will are active Principles by which we move our bodies, and thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us.' In the course of the eighteenth century empirical chemists such as P.J. Macquer and Claude Louis Berthollet further explored notions of chemical affinities, and a rage for tabulation, as demonstrated by the plates of Tobern Olof Bergman reproduced here, began to characterize the new science. Dr Adler cites an impres- sive range of possible sources for Goethe's own thinking, traces his use of Erxleben, Bergman, and others, and shows that by the late I79os Goethe was already writing short notes such as 'Verwandtschaft und Trennung. Anwendung aufunsere Indivi- duen'. There are two points to be made here. First, we need to remember that Goethe's interest in natural phenomena extended beyond these empirical studies and still retained strong links with occult forms of sympathy. Rolf Christian 248</page><page sequence="3">Zimmermann's work on the hermetic elements in Goethe's work needs to be borne in mind. Lavater, for instance, had claimed in his early Aussichten in die Ewigkeit that 'die Verwandtschaft der Lebens-Krafte' was the basis of all organized life, death merely the separation of heterogeneous parts, and resurrection the collection of homogeneous parts into a new whole. Goethe's view of nature was an eclectic synthesis of the old and the new science. Second, Adler never quite acknowledges the difference between Goethe's knowledge of these efforts to create a new and more exact science of chemistry and his creative use of this knowledge. For Goethe's thinking remains analogical and symbolic, vividly aware (as in Urworte. Orphisch) of the way our human condition struggles between states of freedom and necessity. Chemical 'laws' of affinity are valuable to him for their suggestive power rather than seen as an inexorable law binding human freedom. We then move on to the novel itself. Adler sets it expertly within its cultural context: Algarotti and Fontenelle's literary popularization of science, and Mercet's Conversations on Chemistry of 806, which included a discussion of affinities and human analogies. The chemical conversation in Chapter 4 is analysed in detail, and leads Adler to conclude that the novel, instead of merely drawing on chemistry, as previous critics have noted, in fact shows Goethe actively intervening and providing an implied criticism of the science. Goethe distances himself both from the scepticism of Boyle and from the naive anthropomorphism of the believers in cosmic sympathy. In their place he offers a new morphological vision which is suspicious of 'objectivity' and insists on the interrelationship between perceiver and perceived. Adler argues for the unity of Goethe's thinking, and suggests that the introduction to the Farbenlehre and Die Wahlverwandtschaften should be regarded as complementary texts. In the final chapter Adler argues that the concept of elective affinity can be seen as providing the basis for social science, since it is a primal social phenomenon found at the level both of the individual and of the large group. After brief comments on the models of social relations introduced by Max Weber and Levi-Strauss, we are led slowly through a detailed analysis of relationships between animate and inanimate bodies throughout the novel. Interesting points are made about Goethe's contacts with the electrochemical work ofJ. W. Ritter as well as the somnambulist theories of G. H. von Schubert, which seem firmly in the tradition of the 'sympathy' writings discussed above. Finally in the last ten pages we come to the question of ethics. The degree to which an elective affinity takes place, we learn, depends on the cohesive force, or character of a given person. Goethe sees man, according to Adler, as existing within an open order that extends from earthly matter to the heavenly bodies. As chemical beings themselves, men are subject to the same kind of chemical processes of attraction and repulsion as all other living forms are. But as spiritual beings, their moral conscience (expressed in character) and their power of love produces a counterweight that gives them a kind of freedom in unfreedom. In the end, then, Goethe's vision leaves us within a world of'fast magische Anziehungskraft', where older occult elements still linger in the new scientific terminology. The scientific model, it seems, is no more valid or persuasive a cosmological guide than its fictive counterpart. Adler's choice of methodology in the last two chapters may restrict his readership. The persistent use of exegesis sometimes seems to leave us too close to the text to be able to exercise critical judgement. We feel ourselves watching a kind of linguistic dance in which certain items of Goethe's text are first isolated, then inspected in microscopic detail, and finally brought into relation with a hundred other verbal forms within this and other Goethean texts. The process is always thoughtful and the new emphases that emerge highlight the complex and integrated nature of Goethe's mental world. But occasionally one longs for a little more criticism Reviews 249</page><page sequence="4">of Goethe's language and style of thinking, as well as an awareness of our own historical distance from it. This is a hermeneutics of the close-up, where edges blur and difference collapses into sameness. For this reason it may be useful to readJeremy Adler in conjunction with Albrecht Sch6ne's recent Goethes Farbentheologie, which offers the wider perspective we also need. Goethe's writings on the theory of colour, he argues, constitute the most fully-developed example of scientific theology in the age when these disciplines split apart. Goethe's attempt to combine a scientific universe of analogies and equi- valences with 'a poetic cosmos full of mythical repetitions, metaphorical reflections, allegorical correspondences and symbolic references', Sch6ne argues, can best be understood as an attempt to combine modernity with the archaic power of mytho- logy. It worked not as a science, but as a richly suggestive fiction. BERKELEY M. KAY FLAVELL Poetry and Song in Late Eighteenth-Century Germany: A Study in the Musical 'Sturm und Drang'. By MARGARET MAHONY STOLJAR. London: Croom Helm. I985. Xii+ 2I7 pp. ?25.00. This study brings to our attention a period in the history of the Lied which has been too long overshadowed by later and more famous developments. It is truly inter- disciplinary and will be of interest to musicians and students of literature alike. It is difficult to do justice to the Kunstlied, if only because of the dual expertise its study demands and its ability to express so much within a short range. Margaret Stoljar gives enhanced interest to her account of a specific stage in the history of this petit genre by her knowledge of the social and cultural background and by her ability to relate this to her specialized discussion. The book will encourage the Germanist to see the lyrics and ballads of the day as waiting on musical realization as their necessary complement; it will help the musicologist to perceive how songs emerged from close contacts between composers and poets. Dr Stoljar succeeds in showing that such links as are well known between Goethe and 'his' composers are equally important in the case of the Hainbund poets. Much more is still to be said on this topic, but possibly not within the scope of a book such as this. The title of the book hints at two (linked) aims: 'poetry and song in late eighteenth-century Germany' and 'a study in the musical Sturm und Drang'. Perhaps the two aspects do not quite overlap: the chosen time-span leads the author to examine aspects of eighteenth-century song which hardly come under the heading of 'musical Sturm und Drang', even if one accepts that this label can profitably be transferred to music. Remarks such as 'an historical study will need to place the song in context both formally, in terms of the development of musical language at the time it was composed, as well as socially, in terms of the habits of performance then established . . . the evaluation of the role of the solo song in the cultural life of the day ... an attempt to illuminate a moment in the musical life of eighteenth-century Germany, in which both text and performance are seen as complementary to each other and both as embedded in the social and political realities of their age ....' (pp. 8, I I, I2) seem to strain that long-suffering term beyond endurance (see also PP.45, 59, 95, 99, 4, I I I, 145). The introduction and the first two chapters provide the necessary background for the detailed discussion of text and music that follows. Perhaps the author's decision to begin at I 770 proves as much a Procrustean bed as a convenient limitation, and she does not always quite avoid giving the impression of a history of music in miniature. But the survey is on the whole very skilfully done and the material deftly presented. Reviews 250</page></plain_text>
