<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHANGING CONCEPTS OF THE BALANCE OF NATURE BY FRANK N. EGERTON University of Wisconsin-Parkside, Kenosha, Wisconsin 53140 ABSTRACT The balance of nature has been a background assumption in natural history since antiquity, but even to the present it has seldom been closely studied. The idea of a balance of nature emerged, but only implicitly, in antiquity. During the 17th century, with an increased knowledge of natural history, the idea became a functional assump- tion, but within a theological rather than ecological context. In the 18th century Linnaeus defined the concept and attempted to make it the foundation of an ecological science. However, it remained tied to theology and was elaborated without critical examination. The existence of agricultural pests, the occasional occurrence of plagues of animals, and the possibility of species having become extinct were kinds of evidence which would have been difficult to reconcile with contemporary concepts. Lamarck was one of the few who perceived some anomaly, and he attempted to save the old concept by arguing that fossils represented early forms of existing species rather than extinct species. His ideas were not widely accepted. Wallace found fault with the Linnaean concept, but it was only a passing thought which he never published. Darwin attempted to assimilate the balance-of-nature concept into his description of natural selection, but without exploring the inconsistencies between the Linnaean concept and his theory. As other naturalists shifted their interpretations of nature from static to evolving, few of them appreciated the need to change their understanding of the balance of nature accordingly. Some naturalists and ecologists who have thought seriously about the balance of nature have postulated somewhat mystical supraorganismic concepts. These, like the general concepts, arose in antiquity, but unlike the general concepts they have won only limited acceptance. Balance-of-nature concepts apparently have receded in importance with the rise of ecological specialization, probably because ecologists have developed more precise concepts of productivity and ecosystem which can serve about the same explanatory functions.

Balance of nature concepts have often been influenced by man's hope for harmony and stability. Edward Hicks (1780-1849), an American Quaker preacher and self-taught artist, illustrated this hope in a series of about fifty similar paintings entitled "The Peaceable Kingdom." He was inspired by Isaiah 11:6, which in the 1830's he modified to fit his time and place: The leopard with harmless kid laid down, And not one savage beast was seen to frown, The wolf did with the lion dwell in peace, His grim carniv'rous nature there did cease; The lion with the fatling one did move, A little child was leading them in love, When the great PENN his famous treaty made, With Indian chiefs beneath the elm tree's shade. 322</page><page sequence="2">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 323</page><page sequence="3">324 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 INTRODUCTION S CIENTISTS attempt to explain nature with generalizations which are called hypotheses, theories, and laws. Scien- tific generalizations are categorized ac- cording to their degrees of comprehen- siveness and verification, and a generalization that has yet to be tested is called a hypothesis. However, the use of this term implies that it has been identified as one to be tested. Some- times in the history of science there have been concepts that have remained as background assumptions for long periods of time without anyone thinking that they needed testing. These concepts are part of science, yet they do not easily fit into the descriptions of science by either Thomas Kuhn or Karl Popper. What- ever disagreements there may be between these philosophers of science, they agree that con- troversy plays a prominent role in the develop- ment of science. According to Kuhn (1970a, b), controversy is characteristic of pre-paradigm and of crisis stages in the development of a science. According to Popper (1970), contro- versy should ideally be a perpetual character- istic of science. Many examples from the his- tory of biology could be used to illustrate their theses. The works of Galen, Harvey, and Darwin, and the controversies over epigenesis and spontaneous generation come to mind. Nevertheless, there are also many topics in the history of natural history that seem to have developed slowly through the ages without significant controversy about them. In such cases the emphasis was upon the accumulation and organization of knowledge in the Baconian spirit, theoretical concepts being assumed rather than being either tested or defended. Three biological concepts which originated in antiquity and had long histories before being questioned were the concepts of microcosm- macrocosm, the great chain of being, and the balance of nature. The microcosm-macrocosm analogy had Greek origins, but it flourished mainly in the 16th century (Conger, 1922; Thorndike, 1923- 58). The great chain of being had a longer history as an influential concept. Lovejoy (1936) has shown that it can be traced back to implicit beginnings in the writings of Plato and Aristotle, and that it remained influential in medieval and early modern thought. It became explicit and most influential in the middle of the 18th century, but was finally discredited when Cuvier published his embranchement theory in 1812. The longest history of all is that of the balance-of-nature concept, which had an equally ancient origin and was related historically and logically to the other two. It has survived into very recent times without effective challenge or testing. This is surprising in view of the fact that the balance of nature has been a fundamental theoretical concept in ecology. Except for Linnaeus in the 18th century and possibly A. J. Nicholson and Carrington Wil- liams in the 20th century, there have been few attempts to define the balance of nature. This deficiency can be understood as the conse- quence of the concept having been a back- ground assumption rather than a hypothesis or theory. Any balance-of-nature concept will as- sume an approximate stability in the popula- tions of species, but since the authors them- selves seldom made this assumption explicit, it is not usually possible to state precisely what a particular author's balance-of-nature concept encompassed. In tracing the history of this concept, therefore, one does not progress from one definition to another, but from one cluster of relevant observations to another. Important consequences have followed from this lack of critical definition. One was poor articulation of different parts of the concept, which led to the retention of archaic assump- tions long after they had become logically in- consistent with other relevant and better estab- lished data. Another was that the limits of the concept were poorly perceived, which meant that there were opportunities for adding un- critical illustrations and amplifications. These accretions included loose analogies between the balance of nature and other conceptual units -an organism, a biotic community, a political structure, and even the universe. Some of these analogies can be classified as supra- organismic balance-of-nature concepts, but these special concepts cannot always be easily sepa- rated from metaphors that were not meant literally. Still another consequence is that not only were the assimilated elements poorly articu-</page><page sequence="4">JUNE 1973 3 THE BALANCE OF NATURE 325 lated, but other elements which should have been assimilated into the concept were not. A synthetic balance-of-nature theory would necessarily have included knowledge from earth and atmospheric sciences as well as from botany and zoology. Occasionally, naturalists indicated an awareness of this fact, but in practice there was not, to my knowledge, any detailed attempt to achieve such a comprehensive synthesis. Therefore, this survey will make only passing references to relevant developments in the earth and atmospheric sciences to indicate when they could have become assimilated. ANTIQUITY In one form or another, a balance-of-nature concept is a part of most cosmologies. When nature is viewed anthropomorphically, the balance of nature is thought to be within the power of gods, and man assists in maintaining it by prayer, sacrifice, and ritual. Through these solicitations he hopes to insure good weather, bountiful crops, the avoidance of in- sect and rodent plagues, or an abundant supply of animals for the hunt. The precariousness of the food supply in a primitive economy taught man that the constancy of nature could not be taken for granted. In Greek civilization this stage of anxiety in man's thinking was preserved in - the myth of Demeter and Persephone (Hamilton, 1953, pp. 49-54; Rose, 1957, p. 27). Demeter was the goddess of harvest and her daughter Persephone was the goddess of the Spring. When Hades, god of the underworld, abducted Persephone, her mother's sorrow left the world in perpetual winter until the prayers of men persuaded Zeus to intervene and ar- range for Persephone's return to earth for half of each year. With the development of pre-Socratic natural philosophy such myths waned in importance, but the progressive rationalization of nature by the Greeks was never so extensive as entirely to erase from their science a belief in anthropo- morphic forces. Such a belief, however, was not incompatible with the idea of natural laws, for that idea was derived from the idea of human laws. This connection is illustrated in the cosmology of one of the first natural phi- losophers, Anaximander. He believed that "the source of *;oming-to-be for existing things is that into which destruction, too, happens ac- cording to necessity; for they pay penalty and retribution to each other for their injustice according to the assessment of Time" (Kirk and Raven, 1957, p. 117). There is ambiguity in this statement, yet it foreshadowed the Demo- critean ideas of the constancy and conservation of force and matter. It also conveys a more abstract impression of the balance of nature than is possible in an anthropomorphic myth. Practically all of the ideas of the pre-Socratic natural philosophers that can be related to the balance of nature are similar to the ideas of Anaximander in being concerned with forces and matter, that is, with physical rather than biological phenomena. It would be difficult to imagine the rise of Greek philosophy and science unaccompanied by certain basic ideas that were congenial to the development of balance-of-nature concepts. The pre-Socratic philosophers did indeed de- bate whether or not nature was in a state of flux, but Greek science was built upon the belief that nature is constant and harmonious (Vlastos, 1947; Sambursky, 1964). The Pythago- reans heard musical harmony in the universe (Kirk and Raven, 1957, pp. 229-259), and Greek medicine taught the doctrines of the balance of humors and the healing powers of nature (Jones, 1946; Neuburger, 1943). Accordingly, ecological harmony and balance would have been a compelling expectation. Herodotus was undoubtedly indebted to the natural philosophers for some of his own in- terest in natural phenomena, but his answers to questions about nature tended to be concrete and specific rather than abstract and general. Furthermore, in seeking an explanation for the balance of nature within the living world he confronted the question in a different realm than they, and mere forces, whether animate or not, must have seemed to him inadequate to account for all aspects of life. Reports which he collected from Arabia interested him in the question of how each kind of animal can maintain its numbers. Why did not the birds, beasts, and men eat all the hares? His answer was that a superintending Providence had created the different species with different re- productive capabilities. Predatory species usu- ally had fewer offspring than did the species</page><page sequence="5">326 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 they ate. To illustrate his point he assembled reports concerning the reproduction of snakes, hares, and lions. His account is of great interest because it represents the earliest biological evidence for the balance-of-nature idea. It should also be quoted in full, because we shall refer back to it when discussing the writings of Aristotle and Sir Thomas Browne. The Arabians say that the whole world would swarm with these serpents, if they were not kept in check in the way in which I know that vipers are. Of a truth Divine Providence does appear to be, as indeed one might expect beforehand, a wise contriver. For timid animals which are a prey to others are all made to produce young abundantly, that so the species may not be entirely eaten up and lost; while savage and noxious creatures are made very unfruitful. The hare, for instance, which is hunted alike by beasts, birds, and men, breeds so abundantly as even to superfetate, a thing which is true of no other animal. You find in a hare's belly, at one and the same time, some of the young all covered with fur, others quite naked, others again just fully formed in the womb, while the hare perhaps has lately con- ceived afresh. The lioness, on the other hand, which is one of the strongest and boldest of brutes, brings forth young but once in her lifetime, and then a single cub; she cannot possibly conceive again, since she loses her womb at the same time that she drops her young. The reason of this is that as soon as the cub begins to stir inside the dam, his claws, which are sharper than those of any other animal, scratch the womb; as the time goes on, and he grows bigger, he tears it more and more; so that at last, when the birth comes, there is not a morsel in the whole womb that is sound. Now with respect to the vipers and the winged snakes of Arabia, if they increased as fast as their nature would allow, impossible were it for man to maintain himself upon the earth. Ac- cordingly it is found that when the male and female come together, at the very moment of impregnation, the female seizes the male by the neck, and having once fastened, cannot be brought to let go till she has bit the neck entirely through. And so the male perishes; but after a while he is revenged upon the female by means of the young, which, while still unborn, gnaw a passage through the womb, and then through the belly of their mother, and so make their entrance into the world. Contrariwise, other snakes, which are harmless, lay eggs, and hatch a vast number of young. Vipers are found in all parts of the world, but the winged serpents are nowhere seen ex- cept in Arabia, where they are all congregated together. This makes them appear so numerous (III, 108-109). Although the report of superfetation in hares is correct (Hediger, 1947), most of the re- mainder of this account is not. The winged serpents cannot even be identified (How and Wells, 1912, p. 204). Herodotus should have been able to realize that the situation which he described for lions would not maintain the population, but would lead to rapid extinction. One gets the impression that his informants had gone overboard in attempting to account for the balance of nature entirely by reproduc- tion and predation. Nevertheless, the differen- tial reproductive capabilities of predators and prey has remained a permanent part of balance- of-nature concepts, and the idea that species were created with these capabilities was not strongly challenged before Darwin. The cor- relation that seemed to exist between the reproductive capability and the habits of differ- ent species seemed convincing evidence of the providential arrangement of the balance of nature. This impression was strengthened by Herodo- tus' report of a mutually beneficial relationship between Nile crocodiles and a species of plover: This bird is of service to the crocodile and lives, in consequence, in the greatest amity with him; for when the crocodile comes ashore and lies with his mouth wide open . . . the bird hops in and swallows the leeches. The crocodile enjoys this, and never, in consequence, hurts the bird (II, 68). These reports left the strong impression that nature is well regulated, but Herodotus did not formulate an explicit balance-of-nature concept based upon them. The next contributor, Plato, can be accused of going to the opposite extreme: his discus- sions were mainly theoretical and were based upon too few factual observations. There are in Plato's Dialogues two creation myths that were to be extremely influential sources for balance-of-nature concepts. Such an origin is not unusual. Popper (1962, p. 38) has pointed out that "historically speaking all-or nearly all -scientific theories originate from myths, and that a myth may contain important antici- pations of a scientific theory." The one in Timaeus is the more comprehensive, but also</page><page sequence="6">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 327 the less precise of the two. This myth is the source of two related concepts, the supraorga- nismic balance-of-nature concept and the micro- cosm-macrocosm concept. This creation myth was related in answer to what must now appear to be a very peculiar question: "In the like- ness of what animal did the creator make the world?" The answer of Timaeus (30 c-d) was that God did not make the world like any one species, but rather as "one visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals of a kindred nature." Such a vague account coming from almost anyone else might not have had much influ- ence, but Plato's Dialogues have had an incal- culable influence upon Western thought. The influence of his myth seems to have been per- sistent, but the difficulties involved in articu- lating the elements of any concept which is based upon it seems to have prevented the development of detailed explanations in those concepts. The microcosm-macrocosm concept asserts that the parts of the human body cor- respond to different parts of the universe, and the supraorganismic concept asserts that the different living beings are actually the organs of a super-"being." Both are very mystical concepts, and if it were not for their demon- strable influence, historians of ecology would undoubtedly be inclined not to take them seriously. For the very reason that the supraorganismic concept was vague and never elaborated in much detail, it was seldom seen to conflict with other ecological ideas that might simultaneously exist. Plato himself built no explanatory bridge between it and the creation myth told by Protagoras in the dialogue of the same name. At first sight, the myth of Protagoras seems more primitive than that of Timaeus, because the myth of Timaeus was a cosmological specu- lation similar in many respects to those of the natural philosophers, whereas the myth of Protagoras invoked the old mythological gods, Epimetheus and Prometheus. But if one strips away the introductory mat- ter, Timaeus' idea is seen to be pure speculation, whereas Protagoras' myth does contain some observations, however superficial, with impor- tant generalizations based upon them. This is the familiar myth about the formation of the different kinds of animals which the foolish god Epimetheus undertook. He bestowed traits upon each species which would assist it in escaping its enemies, protecting it from the weather, and enabling it to find adequate nourishment. When he came to man, however, he had run out of traits, and his brother Prometheus had to suggest that man be en- dowed with superior skills and with fire. The myth focused upon man, but of secondary im- portance was its assertion that each species has been providentially equipped with the means for its survival. The influence of this myth was much broader than the one in Timaeus, and its influence is easier to follow. In neither case, however, does the scientific development inspired by the myth follow the pattern outlined by Popper (1962, pp. 50-51, 127-132), who described scientific myths as the origin of scientific debates. The myth in Protagoras reinforced the implicit balance-of-nature concept contained in Herodo- tus' History, and the effect might well have been to stifle rather than to encourage debate. Both accounts conveyed the idea that Provi- dence had formed the different species of animals for a permanent association with each other, and that each was endowed with traits that would enable it to continue to exist suc- cessfully in spite of whatever difficulties it might encounter from other species or from the environment. This view of animate nature, which I have elsewhere called providential ecology (1968a, p. 179), was teleological. It was therefore logi- cally in conflict with the ideas on natural selec- tion of Empedocles and Democritus. The po- tential debate between proponents of these views did not, however, materialize. This was not because either view ceased to attract de- fenders: Cicero and Plotinus were later to expound their own ideas on providential ecol- ogy, and Lucretius was to provide the most extensive defence of natural selection to survive from antiquity. The debate that was to mate- rialize was between natural selection and Aristotle's teleological theory of nature. Aristotle rejected the idea that the traits of any species are for the benefit of any other species than itself (Balme, 1965), and therefore the debates over teleology were generally confined to discussions of the structure of individual organisms. Aristotle was not without ecological</page><page sequence="7">328 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 awareness (Bodenheimer, 1954), but his discus- sions of the balance of nature were brief, indirect, and scattered among other subjects. It is probable that the lack of prominence throughout subsequent history which balance- of-nature concepts suffered resulted in part from his not having come to grips with the subject more directly than he did. Aristotle was a great synthesizer and commentator upon Greek scientific thought from Thales down to his own times, and one might have expected that he would sift through the various ideas on the balance of nature and then offer his own arguments and pronouncements on the subject. One can, in fact, find in his De Generatione et Corruptione the same kind of physical balance-of-nature concept that one finds in the writings of pre-Socratic philosophers, a balance of forces and elements. The whole process of coming-into-being and passing-away he believed was ultimately caused by the annual unequal orbit of the sun around the earth and the resulting seasons caused by the alternations in the amount of heat reaching the earth. But when one turns to living nature, about which he wrote so well, one is hard-pressed to find in his writings even an implicit balance-of-nature concept. This silence may reflect a lack of appreciation for the importance of the subject, but there is also the stronger possibility that he felt that his teleological theory, which focused upon the individual, was sufficient in itself to account for all aspects of life. Aristotle thought of the development of the individual as being the outcome of its internal plan of development striving to organize the raw materials which were to become the orga- nism. Many features of a species which others might see as fitting it for its ecological role he explained as resulting from the limitations of development. Instead of extending the Epi- methean principle of the equitable distribution of traits, he offered instead his own idea of physiological limitation: "No animal that has horns has also front teeth in both jaws, those in the upper jaw being deficient. For nature by subtracting from the teeth adds to the horns" (De Partibus Animalium, 663b36). Aristotle's principle of physiological limita- tion could also explain the reproductive traits of different species: Most trees, if they bear too much fruit, wither away after the crop when nutriment is not re- served for themselves, and this seems to be what happens to annuals, as leguminous plants, corn, and the like. For they consume all their nutri- ment to make seed, their kind being prolific. And some fowls after laying too much, so as even to lay two eggs in a day, have died after this. For both the birds and the plants become exhausted, and this condition is an excess of secretion of residual matter. A similar condition is the cause of the later sterility of the lioness, for at the first birth she produces five or six, then in the next year four, and again three cubs, the next number down to one, then none at all, showing that the residue is being used up and the genera- tive secretion is failing along with the advance of years (De Generatione Animalium, 75iOa21-75iObl). In this passage Aristotle emphasized food and age as factors influencing the reproductive out- put of organisms. In the same work (777b9-16) he pointed out that the size of a viviparous species would be the crucial factor for deter- mining the length of its gestation period. Since he felt that physiological causes were sufficient, he had no difficulty in rejecting Herodotus' report on lion reproduction: "The story about the lioness discharging her womb in the act of parturition is a pure fable, and was merely invented to account for the scarcity of the animal" (Historia Animalium, 579b3). However, since Aristotle was only providing indirect opposition to an idea that had not yet even been explicitly formulated, one should not expect any militant opposition. He did not go so far as to deny the existence of such mutual relationships in nature as were described in Herodotus' report of plovers picking leeches from the open mouths of crocodiles. Aristotle liked that story and mentioned it in three different contexts (Historia A nimaliurn, 612a20; De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus, 831al 1-14; Ethica Eudemia, 1236b9), and he also reported that mutualism existed between the bivalve, Pinna, and the crustacean, Pinnotheres (His- toria Animalium, 547bl6-17). In another pas- sage he accepted mutualism and implied that it was compatible with his own physiological concepts. He wrote that the mouths of dolphins and sharks were placed on the under surface "not merely to provide a means of salvation for other animals, by allowing them oppor- tunity of escape during the time lost in the act</page><page sequence="8">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 329 of turning . . . but also to prevent these fishes from giving way too much to their gluttonous ravening after food" (De Partibus Animalium, 696b24-33). In one case he suggested that both behavior and environmental factors prevent overpopula- tion in minnows: These fishes shed their eggs little by little, and . . . the males swallow the greater part of them, and some portion of them goes to waste in the water; but such of the eggs as the female deposits on the spawning beds are saved. If all the eggs were preserved, each species would be infinite in number. The greater number of these eggs so deposited are not productive, but only those over which the male sheds the milt or sperm (Historia Animalium, 567a31-567b3) Yet, Aristotle provided no theoretical context for these observations, and consequently their importance went unnoticed in antiquity. His most direct support of the balance-of-nature idea came in his discussion of the reproduction of birds of prey: The eagle lays three eggs and hatches two of them . . . though occasionally a brood of three has been observed. As the young ones grow, the mother becomes wearied with feeding them and extrudes one of the pair from the nest. At the same time the bird is said to abstain from food, to avoid harrying the young of wild animals... The phene is said to rear the young one that has been expelled from the nest (Historia Animalium, 563a16-26). Discussions such as this show in retrospect a need not only for a greater skepticism about second-hand reports than anyone possessed in antiquity, but also a need for an ecological theory that would define the limits of species interactions. Aristotle's teleological concept prevented him from exaggerating either the balance in nature or mutualism, but primarily by focusing his attention elsewhere. What was needed was some relative assessment of the importance of mutualism versus competition in nature. However, before any answer could be given, the question itself would have to be discovered. When discussing the habits of ani- mals, Aristotle did group his examples of com- petition separately from his examples of preda- tion (Historia Animalium, 6O8b19-609b2O), but he did not state explicitly the difference be- tween these categories, and they were not fully distinguished in the minds of naturalists before the 19th century (Egerton, 1971). Aristotle provided no support, to the best of my knowledge, for the supraorganismic concept. There were aspects of his biological thought that could have been adapted to that purpose. In his anatomical writings he explained that simple structures were organized into organs, and the organs were then integrated in struc- ture and function to meet the needs of the animal (Historia Animalium, 486a5-14). He also pointed out that gradation in the com- plexity of species which later became the basis for the "great-chain-of-being" concept (Historia Animaliurn, 588b; De Partibus Animralium, 681alO-15, 697bl-4; De Generatione Animal- ium, 732a25-733bl6). Reasoning from analogy, it would have been easy to argue that these two sets of gradations are part of a larger whole, but he did not. Again, he might have been saved from doing so by the focus of his teleology upon the individual. Furthermore, he observed that climate varied randomly without regard to the needs of organisms (Physica, 198bl7-33), which is not what one might expect from a teleological world system. The balance of nature having received only minimal attention from Aristotle, there were few other possibilities in antiquity for a syn- thesis of knowledge on the subject. The natural histories by Pliny and Aelian both focused upon the properties of individual species, and these authors made little attempt to develop comprehensive biological theories. Neverthe- less, these forms of literature did provide an opportunity to add to the knowledge of the balance of nature. This possibility may be illustrated from Aelian's account of the jackdaw: The inhabitants of Thessaly, of Illyria, and of Lemnos regard jackdaws as benefactors and have decreed that they be fed at the public expense, seeing that jackdaws make away with the eggs and destroy the young of the locusts which ruin the crops of the aforesaid people. The clouds of locusts are in fact considerably reduced and the season's produce of these people remains un- damaged (III, 12). If carefully compiled, natural histories could provide useful evidence for a theory, but there</page><page sequence="9">330 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 has never been much chance that a theory would actually be advanced within such works because they are organized around descriptive knowledge rather than theory. The most significant theoretical discussions of natural history from the Roman era were in the philosophical writings of Lucretius and Cicero. The balance of nature idea received implicit support from Lucretius' argument for the constancy of nature, but that issue was no longer in any doubt. Of greater relevance was Cicero's dialogue, De Natura Deorum, in which the balance of nature became part of the Stoic evidence for the wisdom and benevolence of the Creator (bk. 2). In developing this argu- ment, Cicero utilized the essential points from the writings of Herodotus and Plato. The balance of nature was maintained by the existence of differential rates of reproduction, a different place in nature for each species, phys- ical traits in each species which guaranteed its survival, and mutual relationships between certain species. Yet, his argument does not add up to a unified theory of the balance of nature. These points remained merely a series of evidences to illustrate the work of Providence, as seen in this example: In order to secure the everlasting duration of the world-order, divine providence has made most careful provision to ensure the perpetuation of the families of animals and of trees and all the vegetable species. The latter all contain within them seed possessing the property of multiplying the species; this seed is enclosed in the innermost part of the fruits that grow from each plant; and the same seeds supply mankind with an abun- dance of food, besides replenishing the earth with a fresh stock of plants of the same kind (II, 51). Since Cicero's dialogue presented different points of view on the nature of God, there might have existed here some potential for the origin of a scientific controversy. If the polemic had developed, a scientific theory might have emerged, as Popper suggested (1962). This possibility seems to be supported by the writ- ings of the philosopher Plotinus, who wrote about two centuries afterwards. He achieved a more dynamic idea of the balance of nature while defending his own theological beliefs. His goal was to reconcile the existence of evil with a belief in an omnipotent and benevolent creator. Predation was one of the evils requir- ing an explanation. He explained that pre- dation was essential in order for the greatest diversity and quantity of life to come into existence. The positive good of life, he con- cluded, more than justified the necessity of death for the sake of feeding other life (En- neads, III, 2:15). The discussions by Cicero and Plotinus were suggestive, but contained neither important theoretical advances nor a definitive synthesis. The potentials of the theological avenue to scientific theory were undoubtedly reduced by the achievement of a general consensus in Christianity. THE 17TH CENTURY The Middle Ages, in so far as I have ascer- tained, was not a time in which there was much discussion of the balance of nature. The reason might be that a constantly supervising God, in which practically everyone believed, would constantly supervise the workings of na- ture. Elaborate built-in mechanisms within nature would seem unnecessary. However, with the advent of the Protestant Reformation there was a new interest in the details of the gover- nance of both society and nature. A new ad- vancement of the balance-of-nature concept began in the 17th century. This advancement involved the synthesis of old and new knowl- edge within a theological context -a con- tinuation of providential ecology. One of the first to contribute to the elabora- tion of the concept in the 17th century was Sir Thomas Browne, who, good Baconian that he was, attempted in 1646 to separate true scientific knowledge from old wives' tales. One of the questions which he investigated was whether or not the whole world, or only a part of it, had been inhabited before the flood of Noah. This was only a variation upon an earlier question concerning the length of time that it would have required to populate the world from the time of Adam (Egerton, 1966). Since the first patriarchs in the book of Genesis allegedly lived for several centuries, Browne's attention focused upon the relationship be- tween longevity and rate of reproduction. He pointed out that species such as man and the elephant, which reproduce slowly, also tend to be long-lived (1646, bk.6, ch.6). He thus added</page><page sequence="10">JUNE 19731 THE BALANCE OF NATURE 331 the factor of differential longevity to the ones which the ancients had recognized as main- taining the balance of nature. However, he did not then go on to explain how all of the factors which had been men- tioned might work in concert. His organizing plan was skepticism rather than a theoretical framework. Consequently, he did not synthesize his various ideas relating to the balance of nature. In another chapter he examined Herod- otus' report that the female viper kills her mate after copulation and that the young later kill her by gnawing through her womb. Browne realized that the purpose of the report was to explain why fierce animals do not become abundant, and harmless ones scarce. He doubted the truth of the report, however, and suggested that Providence had a better way of limiting the numbers of fierce animals. If we more nearly consider the condition of Vipers and noxious Animals, we shall discover an higher provision of Nature: how although in their paucity she hath not abridged their malig- nity, yet hath she notoriously effected it by their secession or latitancy. For not only offensive in- sects, as Hornets, Wasps, and the like; but sanguineous corticated Animals, as Serpents, Toads and Lizzards, do lie hid and betake them- selves to coverts in the Winter (bk.3, ch.16). Hibernation, he believed, served the dual function of providing man with some respite from noxious animals and also restricting the reproductive season for such species. In the year 1662 another Englishman, John Graunt, added still other factors to the list of those which were known to maintain the bal- ance of nature. In his Natural and Political Observations Mentioned in a Following Index, and Made upon the Bills of Mortality he analyzed for the first time birth and death statistics, and he discovered the statistical reg- ularity of the sex ratio and of most mortality factors (excluding epidemics) in human popula- tions (Egerton, 1972). These discoveries created a sensation amongst the intelligentsia of Eu- rope. Graunt himself did not receive a higher education, and he was probably not widely read in the natural history literature. He did not indicate an awareness of the earlier dis- cussions of the balance of nature, nor exten- sively exploit the implications of his own dis- coveries for this subject. In passing, he did offer his own suggestion that the populations of predatory animals, such as foxes and wolves, might be kept within bounds by a limited fertility due to excessive promiscuity (1662, ch. 8). Ideas from both Browne and Graunt were incorporated into a comprehensive treatise by Sir Matthew Hale. Hale's purpose, in The Primitive Origination of Mankind (1677), was to defend the Biblical story of creation by disproving the Aristotelian assertion that the earth was eternal. Hale believed he could accomplish this by showing that, in spite of man's slow rate of reproduction, the human population had increased steadily since the time of creation. He even thought he could apply Graunt's estimates of population increase in England to the whole world and thereby corroborate orthodox estimates of the age of the earth (Egerton, 1967, ch. 2). For this reason Hale surveyed the mortality factors for various kinds of animals and for man. In his opinion, these factors were less severe on man than on animals; therefore, he thought that animal populations remain con- stant, while man's steadily increases. His was probably the first comprehensive survey of mortality factors for animals, and at the end of that particular discussion he stated what ap- pears to be the earliest explicit account of the balance of nature. Before that, naturalists and philosophers had discussed only aspects of it or else had only alluded to it. Hale's language was Aristotelian, but unlike Aristotle's De Generatione et Corruptione, Hale's statements referred specifically to animals, while also tak- ing inanimate nature into account: That the vicissitudes of Generation and Cor- ruption are by a kind of standing Law in Nature fixed in things, and the Notions and Qualities of Natural things are so ordered, to keep always that great Wheel in circulation; and therein the Access and Recesses of the Sun, the Influxes of the Heat thereof and of the other Heavenly Bodies, and the mutual and restless Agitation of those two great Engins in Nature, Heat and Cold, are the great Instruments of keeping on foot the Rotation and Circle of Generations and Corrup- tions, especially of Animals and Vegetables of all sorts. That yet these Motions of Generations and Corruptions, and of the conducibles thereunto, are so wisely and admirably ordered and con-</page><page sequence="11">332 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 temperated, and so continually managed and ordered by the wise Providence of the Rector of all things, that things are kept in a certain due stay and equability: and though the Motions of Generations and Corruptions, and the Instru- ments and Engins thereof are in a continual course, neither the excess of Generations does oppress and over-charge the World, nor the defect thereof, or prevalance of Corruptions doth put a Period to the Species of things, nor work a total Dissolution in Nature (1677, p. 211). Evidently Hale perceived no conflict between the ancient providential ecology and the Aris- totelian system of nature. By merging the two, as he did in the above passage, he added an intermediate cause - heat fluctuations - to the purely biological means previously recog- nized as maintaining the balance. Interesting though Hale's discussion was, its influence on natural history is uncertain. Al- though he presented an original and detailed synthesis, his knowledge was clearly bookish, and naturalists might have felt that he had little to say that was new. By the end of the 17th century a number of naturalists were making important observations that had rele- vance for the balance of nature, and with the appearance of their work Hale's must have soon seemed out of date. One of the most prominent of these natural- ists was an Anglican clergyman, John Ray, who published two works on natural theology that were widely read. One of the ecological themes for which he provided a comprehensive survey was of the survival mechanisms of different kinds of animals, for example, the rapidity with which young birds develop after hatching (1691, pp. 92-102). This survey may be seen as complementing Hale's account of mortality factors, but more likely Ray was responding to the arguments of Robert Hooke (1665, pp. 109-112; 1705) that petrified objects represent the remains of plants and animals, some of which are probably extinct. The peculiarity of fossils was that they frequently did not resemble any known living species. If Hooke were cor- rect about extinctions, that fact would represent the first potential challenge to the balance-of- nature concepts which had been developing since antiquity. The Protagoran myth had implied that all species have traits that prevent their extinction, and that implication had be- come accepted dogma. Ray remarked (1693, p. 147) that if extinction had occurred, it would contradict the wisdom of the ages. He sug- gested instead that since the world was still incompletely explored, the species known only as fossils might still live in unexplored regions. This argument was unanswerable at that time, and it prevailed for more than a century (Greene, 1959, ch. 4). The scope of Ray's two natural theology books was very broad and therefore provided a good opportunity for him to broaden the scope of the balance-of-nature concept. To do so was not, however, his goal; as in Browne's Pseudodoxia, the various elements that could have been united into a theory were not. For example, Ray discussed, in The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation, the hydrologic cycle and its utility (Biswas, 1970, pp. 186-187; Tuan, 1968). This was a kind of environmental balance that might have been tied to a discussion of the balance of animate nature. Another of his discussions was in defense of mountains (see Ray, 1713, p. 34). Some people thought that God had played a cruel trick on man by creating them. Ray de- fended their existence by arguing that they provided places to live for species of plants and animals that could not live in low lands, and he gave examples. In doing so he may have pro- vided the first real evidence for the Protagoran claim that each species has its own place in nature. Among the other ecological topics which naturalists investigated late in the 17th century was parasitism. The development of micro- scopes had aroused an interest in insects and other small animals. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek was one of the most diligent of the naturalists who published important observations on such small animals. He and others discovered that parasites were more prevalent than anyone had previously suspected, and that they were often seriously detrimental or even fatal to their hosts (Bodenheimer, 1931). Before those real- izations it had often been assumed that the relationship between parasite and host was mutually beneficial. In fact, that assumption persisted in the 18th century long after evidence was being accumulated to the contrary (Lin- naeus, 1759, p. 102; Hoeppli, 1959, pp. 164-165).</page><page sequence="12">JUNE 19731 THE BALANCE OF NATURE 333 THE 18TH CENTURY During the 18th century the religious context of natural history receded in prominence, but did not disappear. The belief in a superin- tending Providence continued to reinforce a complacent attitude toward the idea of a balance of nature. There was a great expansion of knowledge about the general descriptions and geographical ranges of species of plants and animals, and this knowledge was relevant for further understanding of the balance of nature. However, the contradictions which arose from the expansion of knowledge did not lead to any significant adjustments in the balance-of- nature concepts. William Derham, an English clergyman and naturalist who was a disciple of John Ray, published in 1713 a widely read series of lectures entitled Physico-Theology. His pur- pose, like Ray's, was to show how nature illus- trates the wisdom and goodness of God. He collected an unprecedented number of ecolog- ical examples to defend his thesis, and one of his strongest evidences was the balance of nature. Confidently he claimed: The Balance of the Animal World is, throughout all Ages, kept even, and by a curious Harmony and just Proportion between the increase of all Animals, and the length of their Lives, the World is through all Ages well, but not over- -stored (3rd ed., 1714, p. 171). This appears to be the earliest use of the word "balance" in this ecological context. Like Hale, Derham brought into his argu- ment both the vital statistics of England and the natural history of animals. He implied that for man the statistical regularities found in the occurrences of births, marriages, and deaths was evidence that these were controlled rather than chance events (1714, pp. 174-175). He was aware that birth and death statistics indicated that the population was increasing, but he assumed that this was a provision of God for future disasters. In discussing the regulation of animal numbers he drew upon the familiar factors of differential reproductive capacity and longevity, the diversity of the foods which animals eat, the importance of predation for checking the increase of some species, and different geographical distributions for different species. In his account of foods and predation he placed greater emphasis upon ecological diversity than in fact exists, with the result that he overlooked the importance of competi- tion in nature (Egerton, 1971). On the other hand, his exploration of ecological diversity brought him close to the important concept of food chains (1714, pp. 183-193). Having emphasized the harmony and stability of nature, Derham placed himself in an awk- ward position for discussing plagues of animals. He could only conclude that noxious species "serve as Rods and Scorges to chastise us, as means to excite our Wisdom, Care, and Indus- try" (1714, p. 55). Since he saw such plagues as supernatural occurrences, he felt no need to reconcile them with the balance of nature. The precedent for his interpretation was, of course, the account of the Egyptian plagues in the book of Exodus. Derham's failure to integrate the occurrence of animal plagues into his balance-of-nature concept was probably not entirely the fault of his theological orientation. His contemporaries who were less theologically oriented also failed to formulate a comprehensive and detailed balance-of-nature concept. In studying the food of fishes, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek came closer than Derham to the concept of a food chain, for he described several examples, but he did not take the step from particular cases to a generalization. He also carried out valuable researches into the reproductive capabilities of insects and other animals, but none of these studies resulted in significant generalizations about the balance of nature (Egerton, 1968b). Another contemporary, Richard Bradley, was less thorough than Leeuwenhoek, but was more inclined to draw general conclusions. Bradley's writings contained some important ecological discussions (Egerton, 1969), including interest- ing remarks about the balance of nature. The importance of ecological diversity must have been impressed upon him by both his horti- cultural experience and Derham's book. Brad- ley's observations indicated not merely that "every Herb has its peculiar Insect," but also that "the Insects which nature has designed to prey upon the Flower of a Plant will not eat the Leaves, or any other Part of the same Plant. The Leaves of Plants have their Insects natural to them, the Bark and Wood likewise" (1718, pt. 3, pp. 58-59). Furthermore, recent increase</page><page sequence="13">334 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 in the knowledge of parasites (Bodenheimer, 1931) caused him to suspect that these various plant parasites . . . have their Icneumon Flies which feed upon them, and by the help of fine Tubes growing about them, convey their Eggs into the bodies of the Nympha or Caterpillars, where they hatch as soon as the Caterpillars are laid up in Aurelia, and feed upon them 'till they are themselves perfected, and make their way into the World. ... and it may be these Insects which prey upon others are not without some others of lesser Rank to feed upon them likewise, and so to Infinity; for that there are Beings subsisting which are not commonly visible may be easily demonstrated, if there is any truth in a Micro- scope (1718, pt. 3, pp. 60-61). When farmers near London began killing the birds in their fields because their turnips had been devastated, Bradley convinced them that the real culprits were multitudes of cater- pillars, and that the birds came to eat these insects, not the turnips (1718, p. 58). In 1723 one of his readers, S. C., sent him corroborating observations. S. C. counted the number of caterpillars which a pair of sparrows brought to their young within an hour, which was forty. From this figure S. C. calculated that these sparrows brought 3360 caterpillars per week (Bradley, Aug. 1724, vol. 3, pp. 86-91). These figures seemed to indicate that birds were extremely important for preventing vast devas- tations from insects. Most of Bradley's books were about the practical details of agriculture and horticulture, but in 1721 he focused upon general natural history in A Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature. This book, as its subtitle indicated, was organized around the "great- chain-of-being" concept. Some of its statements provide excellent illustrations of the connection between that concept and the balance-of-nature concept. Being familiar with Aristotle's inverse correlation between the size of mammals and the number of offspring they can produce, Bradley speculated that, "was it possible to know the Nature of all Creatures, we might find, according to their Proportion and different Habit of Body, a continued Progression with regard to their Size, Growth, and Length of Life" (1721, pp. 96-97). While this statement expressed the chain of being physiologically, even less than Aristotle could he ignore the ecological correlations with reproductive capac- ities. Echoing Aristotle, Bradley speculated that in 1000 years the descendants from one fish, if all reached maturity and reproduced, would occupy a volume the size of the earth. Passing beyond Aristotle, however, he went on to suggest that a proportionate relationship existed between the reproductive capacity of fish and their chances of survival (1721, p. 60). He also discussed the available data on reproductive capacities of invertebrates, birds, and mammals, although whatever underlying pattern there might be eluded him. In spite of this, he con- cluded that "all Bodies have some Dependance upon one another; and that every distinct Part of Nature's Works is necessary for the Support of the rest; and that if any one was wanting, all the rest must consequently be out of Order" (1721, p. 159). In these writings considered so far, Bradley appears to have been developing a consistent understanding of the balance of nature. How- ever, that consistency was more apparent than real, as is to be seen when he discussed agricul- tural pests in one of his later works. According to the statements just quoted, one could assume that all species are important for the harmonious working of nature. This idea un- doubtedly appealed to him as long as it remained an abstraction, but when he de- scended to the practical matter of raising crops, he had no qualms about explaining how rats, wasps, and other vermin should be exterminated (Aug. 1724, vol. 3, pp. 92-95). He quoted with approval a letter from another reader, Charles Dubois, which reflected the farmer's constant struggle against insects and implied that what- ever balance there may be is precarious. Dubois was concerned about the ravages of moths, perhaps codling moths (Carocapsa pomonella), among his apple trees: If we consider that every one of these Moths will lay about 300 Eggs apiece, which will hatch into Caterpillars the Spring following, then the De- struction of an hundred of these Moths is preventing the Increase of 3000 murdering In- sects, and so likewise every Caterpillar or Insect that a Bird destroys is preventing at least 300 that would otherwise be troublesome to us the following Year (Bradley, 1724, p. 92). Thus, Bradley was in the same situation as</page><page sequence="14">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 335 Derham. Both reported observations that could not easily be reconciled with their understand- ing of the balance of nature; yet, since it re- mained a background concept, neither showed an awareness of the conflict of ideas. Throughout the 18th century there was a steady increase in the knowledge of the life histories of plants and animals, and at various times this knowledge was related to ideas about the balance of nature. However, it is im- practical in this paper to survey all such dis- cussions. There were literary discussions as well as scientific. Bradley's discussion of insect parasites may have inspired Jonathan Swift's famous rhyme (1733, lines 341-344): Naturalists observe, a Flea Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey, And these have smaller Fleas, to bite 'em, And so proceed ad infinitum. This idea is scarcely comprehensive enough to be much of a contribution to the conception of a balance of nature. However, Bradley's ob- servations, especially those in A Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature, may also have encouraged Alexander Pope's elegant celebra- tion of the great chain of being in his Essay on Man, which suggests that all species are so closely interdependent that the extinction of one would lead to the destruction of all living nature (1733, epistle 1, sec. 8, lines 237-246). The Swedish professor of natural history, Carl Linnaeus, was one of the important found- ers of the science of ecology, and it was he who first gave a name to the balance of nature concept. Before 1749 it had existed without name. Linnaeus' contributions to ecology were contained in essays written over a number of years, some of which were defended as theses by his students. In one of his earlier essays, Oratio de Telluris Habitabilis Incremento (1744), Linnaeus at- tempted to account for the stocking of the world with plants and animals since the time of Noah. He may have been inspired by some of the authors who discussed the longevity of the patriarchs. Hale's Primitive Origination of Mankind was available in a German translation (1683), but even if Linnaeus never saw it, there were numerous other authors who also had discussed the subject (Egerton, 1967). Linnaeus reasoned that if God had originally created only one or two individuals of each species, the numbers of each species must have increased steadily, just as man's population did. Hale had not reached this conclusion because he had argued that the mortality factors operated more severely upon plants and animals than upon man. Linnaeus supposed that the Garden of Eden had been a mountain island on the equator with arctic species living at the top, tropical species at the bottom, and temperate species in between. He further supposed that each species increased in numbers every genera- tion, that as they increased they also spread out over a larger area, and that the size of the habitable earth increased as the populations did. Given the last assumption, biological competition need never become a significant ecological factor. Among the unresolved difficul- ties of this essay, its English translator, Brand, worried about why the predatory species did not consume all the prey species before the latter ever had a chance to reproduce (Linnaeus, 1781, pp. 119-120). The Oratio was vulnerable to criticism be- cause its assumptions about the Garden of Eden were based upon pure supposition. Neverthe- less, it illustrates Linnaeus' propensity to or- ganize his knowledge into comprehensive explanations. Four years later he was more successful with an essay entitled Oeconomia Naturae (1749). It was this term which became the first name for the balance of nature, and this essay was the first sketch of a science of ecology. Linnaeus used his economy-of-nature concept as an organizing principle to unify an important, but previously amorphous, part of natural history. In so doing, he was also attempting to transform an important back- ground concept into the central theory of a new science. Both his concept and his new science deserve close attention. (Such attention is facilitated by von Hofsten, 1957; Stauffer, 1960; Egerton, 1967, ch. 3; and especially Limoges, 1972). First, the concept. Linnaeus read the Swedish translation of Derham's Physico-Theology, but he did not follow Derham in the use of the term "balance." Stauffer has traced Linnaeus' term "oeconomia naturae" back to Sir Kenelm Digby's discourse on the cure of wounds (1658; see Stauffer, 1960), but the true sources of Linnaeus' ideas are the works from antiquity</page><page sequence="15">336 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 which have been discussed above, along with natural histories from the 17th and 18th centuries which belong to the same tradition as those discussed above. The term "economy of nature" bore an obvious similarity to the contemporary term for animal physiology, "animal economy," which involved studying how the parts contributed to the functioning of the whole. Linnaeus may, indeed, have had in mind an analogy between the organs in an animal and the species in a habitat, because his analysis of the interrelations between the plants and animals in nature implied a close and well-defined interaction for the good of the whole. To perpetuate the established course of nature in a continued series, the divine wisdom has thought fit, that all living creatures should con- stantly be employed in producing individuals, that all natural things should contribute and lend a helping hand towards preserving every species, and lastly that the death and destruction of one thing should always be subservient to the restitution of another (1759, p. 32). If this statement were viewed as a justification for predation, it would seem little different from Plotinus', but Linnaeus had much more than that in mind. He was trying to establish a program which could serve as a guide for future observations. The supraorganismic concept might well have influenced Linnaeus' thinking, since the myth of Protagoras clearly did. However, Lin- naeus did not give the former full recognition or support. The version of the concept in Plato's Timaeus was probably too vague to appeal to him. The reappearance of a supra- organismic concept in the 19th century was based upon a new analogy between an organism and a biotic community, rather than between an organism and nature as a whole as it had been in Timaeus. Linnaeus possessed the con- cept of habitat (under the name of "station"), but habitat is not a circumscribed unit in the way that community is, and the analogy would be less appealing when drawn between an organism and a habitat than between an or- ganism and a biotic community. The organizing value of Linnaeus' concept of the economy of nature seems greater than its explanatory power. A whole series of post- Darwinian questions were simply beyond the scope of Linnaean inquiry. Accepting his concept, one would not ask why particular ecological relationships developed or how they might change, because one would assume that such relationships had been created through divine wisdom and that they would remain unchanged. One could legitimately ask how such relationships worked, and Linnaeus did so. The extent to which he asked and answered these questions exceeded Derham's, although his appreciation of the complexities seems to have been about the same. Organizationally, however, Linnaeus' treat- ment of the economy of nature was better than Derham's - better, that is, if judged by modern standards of scientific explanation. Derham, the minister, used ecological examples to illus- trate divine wisdom, while Linnaeus, the professor, used them as the materials for a science. From the viewpoint of natural theol- ogy, Derham had an elaborate explanatory structure, but only bits of it could serve equally well from another viewpoint. The Oeconomia Naturae begins with the above-quoted definition and then explains how that concept can be used to interpret phenom- ena in inanimate nature and in the plant and animal kingdoms. For both the plant and animal kingdoms Linnaeus considered propaga- tion, preservation, and destruction as the phenomena which maintained the economy of nature. Limoges, by extending the coverage of Linnaeus' concept back in time to the Oratio, has developed a pyramidal metaphor to explain the concept. One can represent this theory by imagining a pyramid in which the geographical distribution of the species represents the base, with the phenomena of propagation, preservation, and destruction representing the other three sides. The apex by which the surfaces are held together is the idea of proportion (1972, p. 10, n. 10). According to Limoges, the Linnaean idea of "proportion" (or balance) was not merely the effect of the interactions of propagation, preservation, and destruction, but was actually an additional regulatory principle. Since, how- ever, this claim is based upon one brief state- ment in the Oratio (par. 96), I feel that it is unwarranted to incorporate that idea into</page><page sequence="16">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 337 Linnaeus' theoretical constructs of 1749 and 1760. Linnaeus' theorizing in the Oeconomia Naturae and the Politia Naturae (1760) was mainly confined to interpreting the knowledge which he had assembled and organized. Ac- cordingly, novelty is more apt to be found in his selection of data than in particular theoretical statements. One discussion in the Oeconomia Naturae which was evidently new within the balance-of-nature context was on plant succession (1759, p. 65). This phenomenon might have led to some wonderment about the stability of habitats, but Linnaeus was able to envision a full cycle from lichens to mature forest to the decay of trees, and perhaps a repetition of the succession pattern. In the Politia Naturae Limoges finds a new ecological theory: ". . . the theory of the articulation of the functional groups in rapport with each other, which is to say, beyond the interde- pendence of organisms in the system, the theory of a subordination of functions, of a hierarchy of agents" (1972, p. 13, and in press). Linnaeus described this functional hierarchy in terms of an analogy between the roles of different classes in human society in comparison with the roles of various taxonomic groups in nature. If this idea is considered to be a theory, it is one that was not well developed. As a metaphor it was another potential source of a supraorganismic concept, but it was not a potential which Linnaeus developed. The Politia Naturae was devoted primarily to discussions of the checks on populations which prevent some species from becoming too numerous and exterminating others. Linnaeus noticed the competition between different species of herbaceous plants in meadows, and he concluded that if it were not for the selective feeding of insects, some species of plants would probably crowd others out of existence (par. 12). Thus, although he had a concern for insects as agricultural pests (Bryk, 1924), he nevertheless emphasized their regulatory func- tions. He did not develop a critical method- ology for determining to what extent his observations could serve as a basis for generaliza- tions. Consequently, he, like Derham, often exaggerated the specialization of species. But if Linnaeus achieved no dramatic theoretical innovations, he at least raised the balance of nature to the status of an explicit scientific theory which was at the foundation of a branch of science. Unfortunately, it was not a science that made rapid progress. Natural history was not to be so easily transformed. Most naturalists continued to organize their observations as before, into descriptive catalogues of species. A contemporary of Linnaeus, the famous Buffon, effected a compromise. His Histoire naturelle included the traditional descriptive catalogue of species, but Buffon's strong in- clination for theoretical discussion found ex- pression in occasional essays which were pub- lished with the descriptions. From studies on both rodents and their predators he developed a dynamical perspective on the balance of na- ture. He reconciled the occurrence of plagues of rodents with the balance of nature by postulating for a given species an oscillation between extremes of rarity and abundance. If certain forces in nature permitted a species to become too abundant or too rare, then eventually other forces would come into play to restore the balance. The abundance force was the reproductive capacity of the species, and the destructive forces were weather, pred- ators, and the quantity of available food (Buf- fon, 1756, p. 247). Buffon also came to suspect that man might have exterminated some of the large animals, such as the mammoths and mastodons, which were known only as fossils (Buffon, 1753, p. 173). John Ray's suggestion that species known only as fossils might still be living in unknown regions was becoming more and more difficult to take seriously during the second half of the 18th century. By 1800, most naturalists were of the opinion that some species had become extinct (Greene, 1959, chap. 4). The preserva- tion of all species had remained a definite tenet of balance-of-nature concepts since the time of Plato, and since that assumption was no longer tenable, the validity of all such concepts might legitimately have been ques- tioned. Buffon's successor at the Jardin des Plantes, Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, was far from being the sort of scientist who might have raised such a question. He was by tem- perament a sentimental romantic, and the harmonies of nature were so appealing to him</page><page sequence="17">338 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 that he eventually published a three-volume description of them (1815), though that work was merely a continuation of similar ideas ex- pressed in his ttudes de la nature (1784). Bernardin de Saint-Pierre seems to have been strongly influenced by Linnaeus' economy-of- nature concept, but to have exaggerated the harmoniousness much beyond Linnaeus' think- ing. One of his few ideas of value was derived from his observations on the island of Mau- ritius. He saw that imported species could destroy the natural balance of species on such islands. There are, it is admitted, noxious insects which prey upon our fruits, our corn, nay, our persons. But if snails, nay bugs, caterpillars, and locusts, ravage our plains, it is because we destroy the birds of our groves which live upon them; or, because on transporting the trees of foreign coun- tries into our own, such as the great chestnut of India, the ebony, and others, we have transported with them the eggs of those insects which they nourish, without importing, likewise, the birds of the same climate which destroy them. Every country has those peculiar to itself, for the preservation of its plants (1797, vol. 1, ch. 7, p. 244). If this was a new explanation of animal plagues, it was surrounded by so much that was commonplace that it could have made no great impression. Neither would it have served to explain animal plagues in Europe. THE 19TH CENTURY The conflict between the fact that species can become extinct, which was generally ad- mitted by 1800, and the traditional view of the balance of nature seems to have been realized by few naturalists. One of those who did realize the conflict of thought was Lamarck, but his resolution of it was never popular. It seems probable that the question of extinction may have influenced his abandonment of an earlier belief in the stability of species. He may not at first have realized the theoretical relation- ship between the extinction question and the balance-of-nature concept, because in his Systeme des animaux sans vertebres the two subjects are discussed separately (1801, pp. 22-23, 403-411); but in his Philosophie zoologi- que he explicitly related them. Tout se conserve dans l'ordre 6tabli; les changemens ct les renouvellemens perpetuels qui s'observent dans cet ordre sont maintenus dans des bornes qu'ils ne sauroient depasser; les races des corps vivans subsistent toutes malgr6 leurs variations; les progres acquis dans le perfectionne- ment de l'organisation ne se perdent point; tout cc qui paroit desordre, renversement, anomalie, rentre sans cesse dans l'ordre general, et m6me y concourt; et partout, et toujours, la volonte du sublime Auteur de la nature et de tout cc qui existe est invariablement executee (1809, vol. 1, p. 101). Lamarck, therefore, believed that species change through time, but that in spite of this the balance of nature remains essentially the same. Fossils represented old forms of existing species, and the extinction of species, except for per- haps a few of the largest, was merely an illusion. Lamarck's theory of species changes not only provided an alternative to the possibility of extinction, but it also minimized the possi- bility of serious competition in nature. By exaggerating the potentials of organisms for change and the inheritance of such changes, Lamarck neglected an important factor for any balance-of-nature concept. A blindness to the existence of competition had existed among naturalists since antiquity (Egerton, 1971). During the second half of the 18th century several social commentators in England had discussed competition in society, and occasion- ally they sought support for their arguments from real or hypothetical examples from nature. However, the implications of these discussions for the subject of natural history was only slowly appreciated by the contemporary natu- ralists. Alexander von Humboldt, writing during the same period as Lamarck, made substantial contributions to phytogeography and other ecological subjects, yet even when he observed conflict and change in nature he still empha- sized the preservation of harmony and stability (Egerton, 1970). The first naturalist to make significant use of the concept of competition in nature was Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle, who explained the distributions ,of plant species as being partly due to the competition between species (1820). On a trip to England in 1816 he had met Malthus (de Candolle, 1862, p. 265), and there is a possibility that his awareness of</page><page sequence="18">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 339 the importance of competition in nature might have been deepened by their conversation. The merits of de Candolle's essay were fully appreciated by Charles Lyell, who utilized it in his own even more comprehensive discussion of the distribution of species. As a geologist Lyell was interested in both temporal and spatial distribution, and the scope of his Prin- ciples of Geology (3 vols., 1830-33) enabled him to bring together the various aspects of the balance of nature concept which have been discussed thus far. In rejecting Lamarck's theory of evolution, he also rejected Lamarck's uncritical belief in the great capacity of in- dividuals for change. As an opponent of evolu- tion Lyell found it necessary to explore as thoroughly as possible the causes of extinction. Cuvier's idea of periodic catastrophes he found no more convincing than Lamarck's ideas, and instead he placed his emphasis upon competi- tion as a leading cause of extinction (Egerton, 1968c, p. 235). While developing his ideas on the distribu- tion and extinction of species, Lyell became very much impressed with the ecological writ- ings of Linnaeus. Having assimilated Linnaeus' ideas, Lyell then made his own contributions to the understanding of factors which tend to preserve the balance of nature. Most notably, he described what can be called the buffering effect. Its operation is conceptually simple. It is a biological example of the law of supply and demand, though Lyell did not draw this analogy. His understanding of it is conveyed in the following hypothetical examples. Although it may usually be remarked that the extraordinary increase of some one species is immediately followed and checked by the multi- plication of another, yet this is not always the case, partly because many species feed in common on the same kinds of food, and partly because many kinds of food are often consumed indiffer- ently by one and the same species. In the for- mer case, where a variety of different animals have precisely the same taste, as for example, when many insectivorous birds and reptiles de- vour alike some particular fly or beetle, the usual numbers of the latter may only cause a slight and almost imperceptible augmentation of each of these species of bird and reptile. In the other instance, where one animal preys on others of almost every class, as for example, where our English buzzards devour not only small quadru- peds, as rabbits and fieldmice, but also birds, frogs, lizards, and insects, the profusion of any one of these last may cause all such general feeders to subsist more exclusively upon the species thus in excess, and the balance may thus be restored (1832, pp. 138-139). Lyell's grasp of ecological principles was thus based upon both an awareness of the relevant literature and some observations of his own. Although he possessed a fine critical mind, in one instance he uncritically followed Linnaeus' example of describing the extreme devastations from insect plagues and then at the next moment emphasizing the role of insects as regulators of the populations of plants (1832, p. 134). Before the extinction of species was admitted, one might have reconciled this para- dox in the style of Buffon, but in the time of Lyell the constant preservation of the balance of nature could no longer be so securely as- sumed. One of Lyell's readers who realized this was Alfred Russel Wallace, who remarked: Some species exclude all others in particular tracts. Where is the balance? When the locust devastates vast regions and causes the death of animals and man, what is the meaning of saying the balance is preserved? [Are the devastations of] the Sugar Ants in the West Indies and the locust which Mr. Lyell says have destroyed 800,- 000 men an instance of the balance of species? To human apprehension there is no balance but a struggle in which one often exterminates an- other (McKinney, 1966, pp. 345-346). Wallace wrote these remarks in his "species notebook" around 1855. Here, at last, was the kind of questioning which Popper insists should be a constant characteristic of science. However, Wallace's doubts remained unpub- lished until 1966. In his famous essay "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type," which he sent to Darwin in 1858, Wallace also raised the ques- tion of the balance of nature, but from a different perspective. Under the influence of Malthus, he assumed that all species must produce more offspring than could survive, and he was primarily interested in what the checks to increase were and what were the conse- quences of their operation. The balance-of- nature concept had receded from its momentary prominence in his thinking to its more usual status as a background assumption.</page><page sequence="19">340 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 Another British naturalist who had read Lyell's Principles of Geology and who at- tempted to reconcile extinction with the balance of nature was Edward Blyth. He was a careful observer, but he seldom was able to bring his observations to bear upon his theoretical ideas, and he therefore made no permanent theoretical contributions. He postulated that a "physiological system" of nature exists in which . . . the existence of one species is necessary to that of another, and which binds each race to its locality; where the presence of each is alike necessary to preserve the equilibrium of organic being around; and when circumstances have changed, and the necessity for its agency no longer remains, a whole race perishes (1836; reprinted 1959, p. 124). The brevity and vagueness of these thoughts must have prevented them from being taken very seriously by anyone else, and Blyth never expanded them in his other writings. Similar facile comments about the balance of nature could be quoted from other natural- ists of the period, but without adding much that would be new and useful. It seems un- likely that very much that was new could have been said on the subject until after the pre- vailing ideas on the stability of species had been successfully challenged. The man who attempted to create a comprehensive new syn- thesis of knowledge on species, a synthesis in- volving the balance of nature, was Robert Chambers, a publisher and amateur naturalist. His Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844) was so unorthodox, from both scientific and religious points of view, that he dared not sign his name to it. Prominent naturalists pub- lished hostile reviews of it, but to little avail. It went through ten editions by 1853. What Chambers had to say about the balance of nature was widely read, if not universally respected. His evolutionary theory embraced all of nature, thus being ecological in scope. He achieved an explanation of a balanced nature in a changing world. Since Priestley had pub- lished his first paper on plants and gases in 1772, many naturalists had become aware of the reciprocal gas exchanges among plants and animals and the intermediate air. This was a truly new concept of balance in nature, and Chambers incorporated this knowledge into his interpretation of the fossil record. He argued that land plants probably had to alter the com- position of the air somewhat beyond what the aquatic plants had achieved before animals could exist on land (p. 89); that since reptiles require less oxygen than mammals, they were able to flourish earlier; but with the alteration of the atmosphere by terrestrial plants, the mammals became dominant and the reptiles receded. "In short, we see everywhere through- out the geological history, strong traces of a parallel advance of the physical conditions and the organic forms" (p. 150). As the conditions changed, species either became extinct or evolved into new forms suitable for the new conditions. Chambers' general picture of an evolving world was a fine achievement for an amateur naturalist, yet he was vulnerable on many de- tails. One of the notable scientists who leaped to the attack was the Cambridge professor of geology, Adam Sedgwick. He published a long anonymous refutation of Vestiges in which he took the unknown author to task for lacking scientific rigor. Nevertheless, Sedgwick's own arguments were often something less than scientific; one of his claims even brings to mind the supraorganismic myth from Timaeus. Each organic structure is a miracle as incompre- hensible as the creation of a planetary system; and each structure is a microcosm related to all other worlds within the ken of sense; yet governed by laws and revolving cycles within itself, and implied in the very conditions of its existence (1845; p. 62). In spite of great strides in knowledge, orthodox theory (and whether this is science, philosophy, or religion seems unclear) seems to have pro- gressed in some respects remarkably little. The situation was ripe for Darwin's clean sweep of obsolete, but persistent, theory, and one might expect his sweep to brush aside not only obsolete species theory, but obsolete eco- logical ideas as well. This expectation is en- hanced by the knowledge that Darwin had read the ecological writings of Linnaeus, Buffon, Humboldt, De Candolle, and Lyell, and by the fact that he was something of a skeptic. During his voyage on the Beagle Darwin's</page><page sequence="20">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 341 geological outlook was shaped by Lyell's Prin- ciples, but in other respects he was profoundly influenced by Humboldt's Personal Narrative (Egerton, 1970). Darwin's Journal of Researches (1839) and his "Notebooks on Transmutation" (1837-39) indicate that he was at the time more strongly inclined toward Humboldt's perspec- tive of harmony in nature than toward Lyell's emphasis upon interspecific competition. He changed his mind in October, 1838, after read- ing Malthus -recommended, ironically, in Humboldt's writingss. Darwin then went on to extend the idea of biological competition to the intraspecific level (Egerton, 1973). Darwin's theory of natural selection, with its emphasis upon competition due to population pressure, implicitly corrected the exaggeration of niche specialization which is found in the writings of Plato, Derham, Linnaeus, and others. Furthermore, Darwin's theory also offered a new means of explaining the differ- ential reproductive capacities of species - in terms of their survival requirements, which are both physiological and ecological. This ex- planation therefore represents a synthesis of Herodotus' environmental explanation and Aristotle's physiological explanation. Limoges (1970, p. 151) has commented that Darwin's theory of natural selection replaced Linnaeus' theory of the economy of nature. There can be little doubt about a significant incompatibility between important elements in the two theories, but the logical incompatibility seems to have been overlooked by Darwin and his contemporaries. Linnaeus' concept had been so readily accepted as a truism that even Dar- win's skepticism did not encompass it. In fair- ness to him, the economy of nature was a subsidiary part of his argument and did not receive the deep consideration from him that might have exposed the logical contradictions. As a result, Darwin assimilated what he should either have rejected or else severely qualified. One of the corrollaries of Darwin's theory of natural selection is the competitive-exclusion principle, which suggests that close competitors do not share the same niche (Hardin, 1960). Oddly enough, it seems that this late addition to his theory came to him through a supraor- ganismic mental image, an image that might not have occurred to him if he had previously realized the incompatibilities between his theory and some assumptions related to the economy-of-nature concept. In 1852 Darwin asked himself why populations which become separated diverge into different species. Limoges (1971) has suggested that the answer came to him after he had read Milne-Edwards' lectures on the division of physiological work among the organs of an organism. Evidently Darwin drew an analogy in his mind between the rela- tionship of the organs to an organism and that between the organisms and their habitat. He then realized "that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature" (Darwin, 1959, p. 121). That a supraorganismic mental image was part of his thinking on this subject is sub- stantiated by a statement in The Origin of Species (1859, pp. 115-116): "The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body -a subject so well elucidated by Milne-Edwards." This was a common type of supraorganismic statement in being neither precise nor lengthy. It was a suggestion rather than a proof, and would not have converted a skeptic to a belief in a supra- organismic theory. It might have reassured someone who already believed such a theory, but there is no clear reason to assume that Darwin was one of them. Undoubtedly Darwin's most important con- tribution to the balance-of-nature concept was his description of the high reproductive po- tential of species which is kept in check by a variety of mortality factors (1859, pp. 65-69). Except for his emphasis upon intraspecific com- petition, much of what he said on the subject was common knowledge. However, since this discussion was part of his theory of evolution, there was a new, albeit indirect, emphasis upon the instability of the situation. Yet, this gen- eral theoretical emphasis upon instability did not prevent Darwin from also lending some specific support to the balance-of-nature con- cept. His most conspicuous support of the con- cept came in a descriptive account, based in part upon a paper by Newman (1850) and in part upon his own observations.</page><page sequence="21">342 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers, but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of humble- bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr. H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that "more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England." Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Mr. New- man says, "Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice." Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district! (1859, pp. 73-74) A popular story is often spun out into a progressively more elaborate one the more it is repeated. Such was the fate of Darwin's ac- count. In later versions the cats were said to belong to spinsters who kept them for com- pany; the women were spinsters because so many Englishmen were in the navy; and the sailors ate dried beef that came from cattle which grazed in the clover fields pollinated by the humble-bees (Milne and Milne, 1960, chap. 1). In short, the elaborated version of this balance-of-nature story implied that if the spinsters had decided to confine their cats to their houses, the British Empire would have collapsed long before it did, because as the mice increased, the bees, clover, cattle, and sailors would all have decreased in numbers. Few if any naturalists or ecologists would have believed the most extreme conclusions in the above story, but I have mentioned them to show how easily a good story can get of hand. If it is appealing, the common urge is to embellish it rather than check its validity. The first skeptical reaction to Darwin's account came in Robert Owen's anonymous hostile review of The Origin of Species (Owen, 1860, p. 494). Although Darwin subsequently made some slight modifications, his account remained es- sentially the same through all six editions of the Origin (Peckham, 1959, p. 157). A check on the validity of Darwin's account was finally undertaken in this century by W. L. McAtee. He found that of the two species of forage mentioned, Viola tricolor is commonly self- pollinated and Trifolium pratense is commonly pollinated by honey-bees as well as by humble- bees (McAtee, 1947). Furthermore, the im- portance of field mice in destroying the nests of humble-bees had been exaggerated by New- man. In short, Darwin's account might have occasional validity, but his investigations into this subject had not been extensive enough to enable him to make reliable generalizations. The major significance of Darwin's cats-and- clover account for the present discussion is that it was an old-fashioned explanation sur- rounded, in The Origin of Species, by radically new interpretations of natural history. By asso- ciation, the account became part of the new outlook; yet, since it really represented an old and familiar idea, it was subjected to rather less skepticism than much else of what he wrote. Darwin's scientific revolution had considerably less effect upon balance-of-nature concepts than it should have had. In January, 1860, Herbert Spencer published his essay, "The Social Organism," which de- scribed various parallels between organisms and societies of differing complexities. It was written too soon after publication of The Origin of Species for Darwin's thoughts to have influ- enced Spencer, who built upon his own more cosmic theory of evolution. However, the strik- ing parallels which Spencer found could lead to no definite conclusions because he was un- able actually to tie social and biological evolu- tion together with a definite law. The im- plications of these parallels seemed substantial, however, in suggesting a new evolutionary microcosm-macrocosm concept. Yet, for all his interest in biology, Spencer was a philosopher and not a scientist, and by 1860 it was already impractical to build scientific theories upon speculation rather than first-hand research. Nevertheless, the writings of a popular philoso- pher might well have influenced the thinking of scientists who read his works. Whether or not Stephen A. Forbes was one of these, he at least found the old idea of the</page><page sequence="22">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 343 microcosm-macrocosm serviceable in some form, for he entitled a well-known address in 1887 "The Lake as a Microcosm." Forbes was a very capable field naturalist who conducted eco- logical studies on the lakes of Illinois and summarized his findings in the address. He explained: The animals of such a body of water are, as a whole, remarkably isolated -closely related among themselves in all their interests, but so far independent of the land about them that it every terrestrial animal were suddenly annihilated it would doubtless be long before the general mul- titude of the inhabitants of the lake would feel the effects of this event in any important way. It is an islet of older, lower life in the midst of the higher, more recent life of the surrounding region. It forms a little world within itself -a microcosm within which all the elemental forces are at work and the play of life goes on in full, but on so small a scale as to bring it easily within the mental grasp. Nowhere can one see more clearly illustrated what may be called the sensibility of such an organic complex, expressed by the fact that what- ever affects any species belonging to it, must have its influence of some sort upon the whole as- semblage (p. 537). It may be that this statement reflects the influ- ence, not only of Darwinism and earlier bal- ance-of-nature concepts, but also of the biotic- community concept. This latter concept had been developing for several decades before find- ing explicit expression in Karl Mobius' treatise on oysters (1877; Allee, Emerson, Park, Park, and Schmidt, 1949, pp. 34-35). Be that as it may, ecology was still an infant science when Forbes made these remarks, and the techniques for describing quantitatively the interrelations which he discovered were as yet undeveloped. He had to confine himself to the less complex descriptions of the physical condi- tions of the lakes, the kinds of life found in them, the food chains, and the effects of changing seasons. These descriptions were un- doubtedly useful, but were not exhaustive enough for one to imagine that he had actually proven his conclusions. Perhaps no phenomenon of life in such a situation is more remarkable than the steady balance of organic nature, which holds each species within the limits of a uniform average number, year after year, although each one is always doing its best to break across boundaries on every side. The reproductive rate is usually enormous and the struggle for existence is correspondingly severe. Every animal within these bounds has its enemies, and Nature seems to have taxed her skill and ingenuity to the utmost to furnish these enemies with contrivances for the destruction of their prey in myriads. For every defensive device with which she has armed an animal, she has invented a still more effective apparatus of destruction and bestowed it upon some foe, thus striving with unending pertinacity to outwit herself; and yet life does not perish in the lake, nor even oscillate to any considerable degree, but on the contrary the little community secluded here is as prosperous as if its state were one of profound and perpetual peace. Although every species has to fight its way inch by inch from the egg to maturity, yet no species is exterminated, but each is maintained at a regular average number which we shall find good reason to believe is the greatest for which there is, year after year, a sufficient supply of food" (p. 549). It is doubtful that Forbes intended to imply that no species is ever exterminated; yet, as it stands, this conclusion sounds remarkably like an echo of Herodotus and Plato. However, the cause which Forbes invoked, unlike Herodotus, was not divine providence but rather "the beneficent power of natural selection which compels such adjustments of the rates of de- struction and of multiplication of the various species as shall best promote this common interest" (p. 550). It seems that Forbes was placing an extremely strong emphasis upon the stabilizing effects of natural selection. The causes of the balance of nature might change with different scientific theories, but the exis- tence of that balance was not questioned. The time dimension which was so important for Darwin's theory of evolution was not carried over into the discussions of the balance of nature. THE 20TH CENTURY During the 20th century ecology became a coherent science, or perhaps two related co- herent sciences- plant ecology and animal ecology. There was no science built, as Lin- naeus would have had it, around the balance- of-nature concept. Instead, a number of de- scriptive approaches were developed, to some</page><page sequence="23">344 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 of which the balance-of-nature concept could be tied, but apparently without being es- sential. These include studies of biotic com- munities, populations, productivity, and eco- systems. Because of the volume of modern ecological literature, the discussion of this century will be even more limited than the foregoing discussions of the concept during the previous two centuries. However, since this discussion does include some of the more im- portant publications, it is probably sufficiently representative. After ecologists accepted the community con- cept, one of them soon formulated a supraor- ganismic-community concept. The plant ecolo- gist, Frederic Clements, defended this concept in several publications, particularly in his Plant Succession (1916). There he drew both a morphological and a developmental analogy between organisms and communities. The unit of vegetation, the climax formation, is an organic entity. As an organism, the forma- tion arises, grows, matures, and dies. Its response to the habitat is shown in processes or functions and in structures which are the record as well as the result of these functions. Furthermore, each climax formation is able to reproduce itself, repeating with essential fidelity the stages of its development. The life-history of a formation is a complex but definite process, comparable in its chief features with the life-history of an indi- vidual plant. The climax formation is the adult organism, the fully developed community, of which all initial and medial stages are but stages of development. Succession is the process of the reproduction of a formation, and this reproduc- tive process can no more fail to terminate in the adult form of vegetation than it can in the case of the individual plant (pp. 124-125). At least one ecologist, Phillips (1934-35), strongly supported these developmental analo- gies, but William Cooper bluntly rejected them (1926, pp. 399-400), and A. G. Tansley found them unsatisfactory (1935, pp. 289-299). Pop- perian controversy had finally begun. Charles Elton stated in more general terms: "The balance of nature" does not exist, and per- haps never has existed. The numbers of wild animals are constantly varying to a greater or less extent, and the variations are usually irregular in period and always irregular in amplitude. Each variation in the numbers of one species causes direct and indirect repercussions on the numbers of the others, and since many of the latter are themselves independently varying in numbers, the resultant confusion is remarkable (1930, p. 17). Evidently Clements took seriously the criticisms from Cooper and Tansley. In a paper written in 1936 on "Nature and the Structure of the Climax," Clements was significantly less explicit in drawing his analogy between the develop- ment of individuals and biotic communities (p. 257), and when he collaborated with Victor E. Shelford on Bio-Ecology, his developmental analogies were omitted. Instead, the co-authors quoted the above passage from Elton (Clements and Shelford, 1939, p. 173). Clements' apparent abandonment of his earlier claim might seem to indicate the death of the supraorganismic concept, and perhaps even that of the whole balance-of-nature con- cept. Life, however, lingered in both. The possibility of such an easy resolution of the question was prevented by the fact that the balance-of-nature concept had never been ade- quately defined or defended. Therefore it re- mained elusive. New opportunities for defending balance-of- nature concepts would constantly arise. For example, the homeostasis mechanisms in warm- blooded vertebrates provided the substance for a new analogy, which became part of the most authoritative modern defense of a supraor- ganismic balance of nature concept. This occurs in that great compendium by the Chicago professors Allee, Emerson, Park, Park, and Schmidt, Principles of Animal Ecology (1949). Apparently under the influence of their own studies on termites, ants, and other social animals, they concluded that: . . .the community maintains a certain balance, establishes a biotic border, and has a certain unity paralleling the dynamic equilibrium and organi- zation of other living systems. Natural selection operates upon the whole interspecies system, re- sulting in a slow evolution of adaptive integration and balance. Division of labor, integration, and homeostasis characterize the organism and supra- organismic intraspecies population. The inter- species system has also evolved these character- istics of the organism and may thus be called an ecological supraorganism (1949, p. 728). Henry (1955) and Bodenheimer (1958, pp. 190- 201) have criticized the above concept, but</page><page sequence="24">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 345 nevertheless both Clements' developmental analogy and the homeostatic analogy of Allee et al. have survived in some form. For some ecologists these analogies seem to be merely heuristic devices, but in other cases (e.g., Odum, 1969) it is not altogether clear whether the usage is only metaphorical. Since the time of Darwin the dominant idea about the control of populations has been that natural selection has determined how many offspring a species produces, and the number is always somewhat in excess of what can survive to maturity, the excess dying in the struggle for existence. Although Darwin noted cases where the struggle was against the environment rather than against other organisms (1859, p. 62), his emphasis was upon intraspecific and interspecific competition. In the 20th century there has been much discussion of the extent to which populations are controlled by com- petition as against other factors. The debate seems to have begun with Kro- potkin (1902), who argued that weather is more important than competition for con- trolling populations. His observations were largely confined to Siberia and were not neces- sarily representative of other climates. During the following years the distinction came to be made between density-dependent and density- independent factors, but the debate over the relative importance of the various factors af- fecting populations has not yet yielded a con- sensus among ecologists (Allee et al., 1949, p. 331; Andrewartha and Birch, 1954, pp. 16-25; Lack, 1966, pp. 281-312; McLaren, 1971). While that debate is directly relevant to the present discussion, it is too involved to be sum- marized adequately here. Some notable ex- amples, however, should not be omitted. The papers of A. J. Nicholson have attracted much discussion, and two early ones focus specifically upon the balance of populations (Nicholson, 1933; Nicholson and Bailey, 1935). Responding to Elton's statement, Nicholson remarked, "It appears to be usual at present to deny the existence of the 'balance of nature,' about which there has been so much vague talk. Therefore, before considering the ques- tion of the balance of animal populations, we must examine the arguments for and against the existence of such balance" (1933, p. 132). There were two arguments which had been used to reject the balance of nature: popula- tions do not remain at a constant level; and natural selection cannot maintain the balance. However, neither of these claims seemed to Nicholson to invalidate the existence of a balance, and in support of the balance of nature he cited several laboratory studies on insect populations. He also offered in defense of the balance an analogy that seems as elusive as the balance of nature itself: The balance of animal populations is similar to that of a balloon acted upon by the changing temperatures of night and day. Such a balloon rises and falls in relation to the change in tem- perature, for this varies the volume of the balloon and the density of the surrounding air. The balloon is continually in a state of tending towards a position of stationary balance, but continues to rise and fall because the position of stationary balance is changing all the time (1933, p. 133). This analogy has drawn fire from other ecolo- gists, such as H. G. Andrewartha and L. C. Birch, who reject the idea that density-de- pendent factors control population. They com- plained that in Nicholson's discussion, "It is not easy to understand what precisely is meant by the word 'balance'" (1954, p. 20). Other notable examples are concerned with mechanisms within species for regulating their numbers. Wynne-Edwards (1962) has argued that there are behavioral mechanisms for this, but his interpretations have not won wide- spread acceptance (Lack, 1966, pp. 311-312; G. Williams, 1966, pp. 243-246). MacArthur and Wilson (1967) have found that for island species the regulatory mechanism is natural selection. They concluded that species having high rates of reproduction are more likely to survive during the early colonization of islands when populations are low, but that selection pressure would later favor species with lower rates of reproduction. Krebs, Gaines, Keller, Meyers, and Tamarin (1973) have most recently argued that natural selection might regulate populations not only by changes in rates of reproduction, but also by changes in migratory habits. What, then, is the status of the balance-of- nature concept today? For many ecologists it may have been superseded by more precise</page><page sequence="25">346 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 48 ecosystem concepts of productivity, succession, and energy flow (e.g., Margalef, 1963). If this is true, it may mean that these ecologists only think in terms of the balance of nature when they need a poetic or propagandistic phrase for a discussion of conservation or pollution. If this is the case, such a usage could still in- fluence their own thinking as well as that of the general public. A few ecologists have actually cogitated re- garding the concept and have attempted to give it a modern meaning. Carrington Williams wrote a book entitled Patterns in the Balance of Nature (1964), in which he described mathe- matically not merely the population fluctua- tions of one or two species, as had commonly been done in the recent past, but rather "the pattern in which all the species in an asso- ciation are balanced" (p. v). To Williams, how- ever, the balance of nature represented an ap- proach to a problem more than it did a hypothesis. Each species establishes temporarily an uneasy balance of numbers among all the others. The pattern of the relative abundance of all the spe- cies in a mixed community (and all wild com- munities are mixed) is thus a synthesis of all the competition and co-operation, and all the diffi- culties and facilities, that have surrounded all the species of the community in the recent past; and every minute the position of any one spe- cies is changing in relation to the others. The pattern of relative abundance is thus an expression of the momentary balance which has been set up among all the species of the associa- tion, and it is important to find out whether, as time passes, the fundamental pattern changes, or if the species move in their relative abundance within a more or less stable pattern. This is the approach to the problem of the "balance of nature" from the point of view of quantitative synecology (p. 2). Although Williams' statistical descriptions may be very useful, they led to a series of limited conclusions rather than to a broad, well-defined theory of the balance of nature. One of these conclusions which does fall within the bounds of traditional balance-of-nature thought turns out to be his most speculative. If the population remains for a long period without interference from outside, and if the physical environment also remains constant, a steady state of balance might theoretically be achieved. Any sudden change, such as the intro- duction of a new species, produces a state of "imbalance" and the various forces of population control will set about returning to a new balance, although this may be only a new variation of the older pattern. Such cases are well known in the accidental introduction of insects into a new country, where they have rapidly increased in numbers to become a major pest. Man then makes efforts to restore the previous balance by the introduction of enemies of the new pest (p. 295). Two other biologists, Lorus J. Milne and Margery Milne, have recently written a book entitled The Balance of Nature (1960), but it provides no evidence for the current viability of a balance-of-nature theory. The book is written for the general public, and although it provides some documentation for the cases described, it is far short of being a scientific treatise. The provision of rigorous evidence of causal relations is beyond the book's scope, but even if it were not, no general theory emerges. As in times gone by, the balance of nature is simply taken for granted, and a series of specific illustrations described. It is very much in the spirit of Herodotus, whose story about the relationship between the Nile crocodile and plover is actually mentioned (p. 66). Not all recent ecologists have shared the belief of Williams and the Milnes that the balance of nature can remain any longer a viable concept. Erhlich and Birch, reacting to a passing reference to the balance of nature by Slobodkin, responded as follows (1967, pp. 97-98). The existence of a supposed balance of nature is usually argued somewhat as follows. Species X has been in existence for thousands or perhaps millions of generations, and yet its numbers have never increased to infinity or decreased to zero. The same is true of the millions of other species still extant. During the next 100 years, the num- bers of all these species will fluctuate; yet none will increase indefinitely, and only a few will become extinct. Furthermore, most species have at least some populations living in areas where they are well able to cope with the climate, yet even these populations never increase indefinitely. Such "observations" are made the basis for the statement that population size is "controlled" or "regulated," and that drastic changes in size are</page><page sequence="26">JUNE 1973] THE BALANCE OF NATURE 347 the results of upsetting the "balance of nature." Sometimes this is put in other ways, such as "on the average, the species just replaces its numbers in successive generations" or "on the average, the numbers of individuals over a long period of time are constant." An extreme version can be found in Slobodkin (1961, p. 46). "Despite this enor- mous variation in reproductive patterns, each female adult animal alive now -in every species, in almost every location -will be replaced by precisely one female alive a generation from now. If this were not the case, the size of animal popu- lations would be changing permanently and strikingly at a much greater rate than any exist- ing evidence indicates." To the critique which followed these words, Slobodkin, Smith, and Hairston (1967) replied that in their opinion it was unlikely that any contemporary biologists actually held the con- cept which Ehrlich and Birch refuted. This controversy has seemed significant enough for the papers to have been reprinted in a collec- tion of articles on population and community ecology (Hazen, 1970). In spite of all these negative comments, it seems likely that to sound a death knell for the balance-of-nature concept would at present be precipitous. A better approach might be for ecologists to define the limits of validity of the balance-of-nature concept within the con- text of modern ecology. The balance of nature is analogous to the stability of species. There are forces which tend to preserve the demo- graphic stability of species just as there are forces which tend to preserve their genetic stability. In the short run, both biotic com- munities and species appear to be stable, but in the long run there are dramatic permanent changes in both. Mutations and natural selec- tion gradually change species. Extinctions, species evolution, changes in species composi- tion, and environmental alterations change natural communities. Some species, and some communities, are much more stable than others. When one studies evolution and genetics it is important to recognize both the forces of stability and of change and to formulate sci- entific hypotheses, theories, and laws accord- ingly. The same is true in ecology. The forces of stability and change must be carefully studied and then applied to the subject of the balance of nature. Then critical scientific gen- eralizations can be formulated which do not have their foundation in hidden traditions that extend all the way back to Greek mythology.
