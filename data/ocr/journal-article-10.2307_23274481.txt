Oxford: Peter Lang, 2011. xviii + 172 pp. BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN? AN EXPLORATION OF DUAL BELONG ING. By Rose Drew. London: Routledge, 2011. xii + 274 pp. At a time when so much is being written about interreligious dialogue and com parative theology, not much attention has been paid to the experiences of those who have ventured from one faith tradition—usually Christian—into the spiritual world of another, a striking exception being the chapter on Abhishiktänanda in Jacques Dupuis's Jesus Christ at the Encounter of World Religions ( 1991 ). The books under review represent a giant leap forward in reflection on what has come to be known as "dual belonging." Each draws on extensive empirical research, in Goosen's case separately published,1 in Drew's citing a dossier of in-depth interviews, which are interwoven with references to published works. The theological reflections in each case are thus anchored in firsthand testimonies of those who claim to belong in some sense to more than one tradition. Borrowing terms that might be used in German, while Goosen explores the Bedingungen der Möglichkeit (conditions of possibility) of there being such a thing as dual belonging at all, Drew provides the Probe aufs Exeinpel (test case) by entering deeply into the experience of six Christians who, in significantly differ ent ways, claim allegiance to certain forms of Buddhism: Roger Corless Sr., Ruth Furneaux, Ruben Habito, John Keenan, Sallie King, and Maria Reis Habito. No summary can do justice to the richly textured material they offer for our reflection. The interviewees' ruminations are repeated verbatim, with all their hesitations and ambivalences, which gives us a wonderfully refreshing alternative to the stilted prose of so much theological writing. Whereas Goosen incorporates the hyphen into the conception of his work and its title, Drew deliberately refrains from using it, and the subtle difference between "Buddhist-Christians" and "Buddhist Christians" turns out to be extremely interesting. As the authors were unaware of each other's work at the time of writing, it may be useful to consider some of their key themes in parallel, noting differences and agree ments. One of Goosen's main aims is to establish criteria for dual belonging that dis tinguish it from syncretism. He defines dual religious belonging "as occurring when a person has a first major religion and draws on a second to a greater or lesser degree according to the three criteria of doctrine, practices and actions" (Goosen, p. 19). Drew is more inclined to accept syncretism or "patchwork-religion" (Drew, p. 216, citing Schmidt-Leukel) as an element in all religion, and with Ninian Smart she envisages "an inter-system consensus about criteria" (Drew, p. 218). This point from her conclusion harks back to one she makes in her introduction: each dual belonger is considered to have one primary religious adherence onto which another is later grafted, much as one begins Buddhist-Christian Studies 32 (2012) 150-154. © by University of Hawai'i Press.

Both authors stress that their observations are made on the basis of the experience of those they interviewed, even if this experience is non-conceptual (Goosen, p. 17; Drew, p. 66). Yet Sallie King insists "that there are no grounds for constructing a hierarchy when it comes to theistic and unitive experi ences" (Drew, p. 71). Indeed, King claims to belong "one hundred per cent" to her Quaker and Buddhist allegiances (Drew, pp. 34, 202), whereas Goosen lays down that one's adherence to a second tradition will always be less than 100 percent (Goosen, pp. 143, 161). Where they agree is that dual belongers must be prepared to live with ambiguity (Goosen, p. 50), albeit in a "fruitful tension" which for King is her "natu ral köan, the Spirit leading her forward" (Drew, p. 223). If the possibility of a new synthesis or tertium quid is rejected, then the traditions themselves must dictate the terms of their integration (Drew, p. 215). The question remains whether a complete reintegration of two traditions in one person's thought and practice is ever achievable (Goosen, p. 144). The point is crucial, as becomes evident when each author draws on the troubling testimony of Roger Corless, who was determined to keep his Christian and Bud dhist beliefs and practices entirely separate to preserve the integrity of each. Whereas Goosen seems content to accept Corless's postulate of a "superconsciousness" in which apparently conflicting loyalties are reconciled (Goosen, p. 46), Drew regards his solu tion as at best mutual inclusivism (not to say exclusivism) (Drew, pp. 113, 182, 222). Furneaux insists on a non-dual resolution that she finds in her Buddhist practice; Drew regards her prioritizing of Buddhism as Buddhist inclusivism (Drew, p. 186). Corless ended by invoking Gaia, the Earth Mother, as the primal matrix of all human spiritual strivings (Drew, p. 189), but this only serves to intensify the problem of admitting a "higher" framework "outside" the traditions with which one is involved. If such a framework is neither Buddhist nor Christian, it is hard to see how it can yield criteria by which dual practitioners could make judgments about their religious status (paradoxically, the very predicament Corless strove to avoid, Drew, p. 214). Another vexed question both authors must tace is the accusation of relativism. Goosen quotes Claude Geffré to the effect that "religious truth is not necessarily under the sign of the principle of non-contradiction" (Goosen, p. 50), whereas Drew is not prepared to follow Corless and others in accepting that there may be more than one ultimate reality (or, in the case of S. Mark Heim, different ultimate goals) if one must then have recourse to a higher consciousness in which different realities "co-inhere," putting their incompatibility down to "a failure of our logic" (Drew, p. 47). If ultimate reality is reality, then it is objective, and if it is ultimate, it is one (Drew, pp. 107, 208). But, as Goosen points out with reference to the Dublin philosopher Paul O'Grady, we have grown used to dealing with incompatible but complementary realities, for example in physics, by reckoning with an extended rationality" (Goosen, p. 119), and he initiates a Trinitarian line of inquiry that sug gests that, when dealing with persons, relationality is at least as important as rational</page><page sequence="3">BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES ity (Goosen, p. 39). Drew notes Makransky's criticism that the Trinitarian relations nevertheless do not overcome the dualism of self and God. "Makransky and Heim agree that in the final analysis, their soteriological goals are incompatible with each other" (Drew, p. 124). Another aspect of conflicting religious truth claims exploited by both authors is that religious language consists fundamentally of symbol and story, these being the only media in which we can speak of religious "objects" at all (Goosen, p. 95; Drew, p. 79). It is crucial to Goosen's whole argument for the possibility of dual belonging that religious symbols may be reappropriated: "This is why, I believe, dual religious belonging is possible in the sense of using other symbols" (Goosen, p. 110), and "[t]his vision of truth . . . will allow us to accept the possibility of dual belongers" (Goosen, p. 123). Discussing prayer in Buddhist and Christian contexts (Drew, p. 166), Drew notes that Buddhists too practice petitionary prayer and that Christian contemplatif) has affinities with satipatthäna and zazen (Drew, pp. 167, 172, 177). But she also echoes warnings by Aloysius Pieris and Bettina Bäumer that interreligious borrowings, unless they are subjected to rigorous appraisal by competent authorities, can be akin to "theological vandalism" and "spiritual theft" (Drew, pp. 180—181). Lurking in the background of these considerations arising from the experience of individuals are more properly theological concerns. For Goosen it is a fundamental principle that revelation is continuous (Goosen, p. 50) and occurs in all religions (Goosen, p. 72). He sees clearly both that Jesus is limited by time and culture (Goosen, p. 130—132) and that Christianity is neither unique nor superior, yet he can agree with Peter Phan that "Jesus is the only Christ and Saviour" (Goosen, p. 116). Drew, for her part, asserting that there is one and only one ultimate reality, sees no reason why there cannot be more than one incarnation of it (Drew, p. 88). The pluralist Spirit Christology she advocates with Roger Haight and Paul Knitter (with a welcome ref erence to Rahner's transcendental Christology, Drew, p. 90) entails "a non-constitutive interpretation of Jesus Christ's role in salvation" (Drew, p. 93). This ushers us into the hotly contested arena of religious pluralism. Both authors distinguish between what Drew calls "soft" and "hard" pluralism (Drew, pp. 3, 132—133). Criticising Walter Kasper, Goosen eschews extreme pluralism in the sense of postmodern subjectiv ism while advocating "dual religious belonging where compatibility with Christian teachings is maintained" (Goosen, p. 156). Squaring this circle, however, is not as easy as Goosen seems to suggest. Drew takes her stand on what she calls "monocentric pluralism," though she concedes that most of her interviewees would draw back from the absolute equality thesis implicit in the "hard" pluralism of John Hick and are sat isfied with the agnosticism of "soft" pluralism (Drew, p. 133). Each author discusses this fundamental problem in the context of what Goosen calls "embodied persons in community" (Goosen, p. 40). Drew takes into account "the relevant religious author ity' (Drew, p. 223): to one degree or another, the individuals concerned are not acting entirely alone, but must take account of authoritative teachers and community con sensus. This "ecclesiological" dimension of dual belonging and its need for some kind of sañgha deserves much further thought. If it is granted that dual religious belonging takes us beyond the syncretism of</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS random bricolage and New Age self-fulfilment, there remains a lingering suspicion that the experiment of entering as fully as possible into another religious tradition will leave one spiritually immature and hinder further progress (Goosen, p. 146; Drew, pp. 9, 209, 215). Each author firmly refutes this objection. The process of identity formation, including conversion from one standpoint to another, "is ongoing to a greater or lesser extent throughout life" (Goosen, p. 143) and can "transform the individual from a state of spiritual immaturity to spiritual adulthood' (Goosen, p. 146), and Drew credits individuals with the capacity for "selective appropriation" (Drew, p. 216). Here the theme of authentic personhood comes into its own, and Goosen draws on the Buddhist not-self teaching (anattä) as a corrective to Western individu alism and, by implication, the anthropomorphism of so much Christian devotional ism (Goosen, p. 55—58). If this should mean, however, that on attaining the Buddhist goal of nirväna individuality itself is lost, then yet another fundamental challenge to the validity of dual belonging is opened up (Drew, p. 127). Goosen's book, with its straightforward didactic prose and clear explanations of terms, should be accessible to Christians with or without a theological background who feel deeply drawn to another tradition without wanting to abandon their own, and as we have seen he raises many of the basic issues also addressed by Drew. But within the greater scope offered by her Glasgow PhD thesis, Drew is able to go more deeply into problems that conventional writing on interreligious dialogue tends to skate over. She does this by adhering closely to the evidence provided by her six theo logically literate interviewees. The questions thrown up by their personal experience have profound implications for the future of interreligious relations: the relationship between radical transcendence and classical theism (Habito, though ambivalent, is particularly enlightening here), the reality or otherwise of karma and rebirth (King wonders whether Western Buddhists are fully honest in facing up to this, Drew, p. 153—154), the relationship between karma and Original Sin and the relationship of both to grace, the irreducible particularity of human relationships and the inevitabil ity of preferential attachment to those we love (King's comments on this as a wife and mother are thought-provoking), the conflict between the law of karma and the imperative of justice, and many more. If Goosen's book opens up the whole area of dual belonging to the many Christians who seek guidance as they are attracted to other faiths, Drew's engages with scholars whose reflections on interreligious dialogue may be too abstract to deal with the exigencies of dual spiritual practice. At various points she counters the objections of critics like Catherine Cornille that dual belonging amounts to an instrumentaliza tion of another tradition and could lead to arrested spiritual development. On the contrary, she says, . . Buddhism and Christianity do not undo one another's work; rather, they are found to be mutually reinforcing and complementary" (Drew, p. 163). Her guiding principle as she sifts through the sometimes puzzling contradictions in her interviewees' testimonies is the necessity of accepting monocentrism as the affirmation of one ultimate reality (Drew, p. 84). "I suggest that, at the conceptual level, integration is best achieved by interpreting both figures [Jesus and Gautama] as equally effective mediators of one transcendent ultimate reality . . . one's ultimate</page><page sequence="5">BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES commitment is not to either of these figures per se, but to transcendent reality through one or both of them" (Drew, p. 107). Goosen's position is premised on the polyva lence of symbolic language and the possibility of its reappropriation by those who are not its primary users: "all our religious language is made up of religious symbols" and is therefore paradoxical and dialectic, "[y]et a sense of symbolism is basic to all religions" (Goosen, pp. 95—96, 99)- Each throws down the gauntlet to those who would keep religious traditions hermetically sealed off from one another. In their view, dual belongers are "microcosms of the dialogue" (Drew, p. 227) and pioneers of a future global theology that would not be an artificial synthesis but a "celebration of differences and the richness of diversity" (Drew, p. 228) as each religion's distinctive theology becomes global. Both books are highly recommended to their respective readerships, which in the case of scholar practitioners will overlap.
