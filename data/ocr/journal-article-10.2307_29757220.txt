<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Recent Discovery of Cave Paintings in Swat A Preliminary Note by A. Nazir Khan, Abdul Nisar, Luca M. Olivieri and Matteo Vitali Introduction In 1990 the existence of a cave with vestiges of paintings was reported in the Kafir-kot area, in a locality its explorer called 'Nokkono Ghwand' situated in the southern left side of the Swat Valley near the village of Thana. I followed up this information which was found to be correct during a survey made by P. Brocato and myself that same year in August. Mr A. Nazir Khan, former Director of the Swat Archaeological Museum, has the merit of discovering the cave with the paintings. He appointed N. Olivieri, the draughtsman of the IsMEO Italian Archaeological Mission in Pakistan, to make the first tracing of the paintings in the spring of 1990 (Faccenna et al. 1993: 121, fn. 4). This material was subsequently published in 1994 (Nazir Khan 1994). The discovery of the existence of these cave paintings has been of particular value to the Italian Archaeological Mission's research on the rock carvings in Swat. D. Faccenna, then Director of the Mission, appointed A. Filigenzi, assisted by L.M. Olivieri for the documentary part, to do the work (Callieri 1990; Olivieri in C. Faccenna et al. 1993; Olivieri 1994). In the summer of 1993, at the invitation of the new Director of the Swat Archaeological Museum, M. Ashraf Khan, the IsMEO Mission undertook to survey the area with A. Nisar, Assistant Curator of the Museum, who knew of another rock shelter in the same area also with traces of paintings. On this occasion a second survey was made of Kafir-kot and a complete set of tracings of the paintings made for the documentary record. Next, the site of Hinduano hatai was visited and tracings of the surviving paintings made (Fig. 2). Successive reconnaissance by the IsMEO Mission, with the help of Mr Fazal Wahid, brought to light new rock paintings at the Shamo site (which may correspond to the Sofar-ghat site mentioned by Nazir Khan 1994: 215), of which tracings were duly made. In addition, the paintings at Marano-tangai (Fig. 3), which had already been reported by A. Nazir Khan in 1994 (Nazir Khan 1994: 215, fig. 5), were traced. Tiny samples of pigment were taken from all four sites in order to analyse the composition. The Kafir-kot shelter, situated on the crest of Mt Morah-sar which separates the Kotah Valley from the Thana Valley, is near the rocky peak which dominates the two vallies (GSP 43 B/2; lat. 34? 35' N, long. 72? 07' E) (Fig. la). The site is referred to here by the topographical name of 'Kafir-kot' because it is more precise than that of 'Nokkono Ghwand' chosen by its discoverer, which, rather than a topographical indication is more a physical one, since nokkono-ghwand in Pashto means 'top of the hill'. [i] 333</page><page sequence="2">A second shelter with vestiges of painting, has been found to the SSW and a little lower down than the first one, in the Shamo locality (GSP 43 B/2; lat. 34? 54' N, long. 72? 09' E) (Fig. lb). The two shelters are in the immediate vicinity of sacred Buddhistic areas, namely: Giroban and Kafir-kot (Stein 1930: 5-6, fig. 6) (Fig. 4). Crossing the peak of Mt Morah-sar by the Saffar Pass (near which some interesting remains such as steps and passages cut in the rock have been noted; Figs. 5-6), and so entering the Kotah Valley, a third shelter with traces of paintings has been found. This is not far from the hamlet of Chuwa (with a ruined st?pa), in the vicinity of the sacred area of Top-dara (ibid.: 6-7) (Fig. 7). More precisely the rock shelter is situated in the Marano-tangai locality (GSP 43 B/2; lat. 34? 54' N, long. 72? 07' E) (Fig. lc). A fourth shelter, also with traces of painting, has been discovered in the Allahdandherai Valley, a little further to the southwest, close to the village of Binjanr, in the Hinduano-hatai locality (GSP 38 N/14; lat. 34? 35' N, long. 72? 00' E (Fig. Id). In the zone where the shelter has been found there are many ruins (amongst which some towers with semicircular bastions stand out and probably date from the Hindushahi period) (Fig. 8). It is not far from the sacred area of Loriyan-tangai (Foucher 1905: 25, figs. 3-5). From a topographical point of view, the four shelters are situated near important passes which connect the Swat Valley with the Mardan Plain. The first three are near the Morah Pass (Fig. 9) and the fourth is near the Shahkot Pass (Foucher 1905; Stein 1921). (L.M.O.) Kafir-kot The paintings at Kafir-kot (Fig. 10) are on the rear wall of the cave, which is formed of massive gneiss granitic rocks resting on each other (Figs. 11-12). The cave is a shallow semi-circular cavity about 1.50 m in depth by the same height. There are no signs of artificial intervention and it is open on the NNW side. The images are painted with a red pigment and, to facilitate description, may be divided into three groups, although they make up a unified composition. On the right, at the point where the ceiling begins to slope down, there are i_i_i i_i_i Fig. 1 - Sketch map of the area (after Nazir Khan 1994: Map 1): a, Kafir-kot; b, Shamo; c, Marano tangai; d, Hinduano-hatai. 334 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - The pinnacle of Kafir-kot seen from the ruins of the sacred Buddhistic area of the same name.

Of these, the central one has garlands hanging down from the chattr?valt, while the access stairway on the third st?pa is depicted schematically. In the space between the first two st?pas the figure of a horseman armed with a bow is shown in the act of shooting an arrow to the rear. Above, one can make out an animal shape but no more (cf. Bemmann &amp; K?nig 1994: T. 29, 24: 17, interpret it as a tamgha). Higher up, where the wall begins to curve, on the right, there is the figure of an archer (note how the head terminates in a point, as though wearing a helmet); next to that there is a st?pa, then a complex elongated form with hornlike protuberances, and last there is an incomplete st?pa. The central group is made up of a grand st?pa flanked by ten lesser st?pas. There are also three human figures and a disc marked with a cross surmounted by a crescent with two divergent lines at the base. The central st?pa is depicted with vertical lines decorating the lower part which most probably represent pilasters; the second storey and the anda have been coloured in, while on the top some elements of the chattrdvali are recognisable such as the harmtkd and the spacers of the umbrellas; swaying festoons are also shown as well as garlands hanging at the sides of the st?pa. (P. Callieri has suggested that it might be a schematic rendering of the pradaksina-patha). In addition, the base has a faint indication of a flight of stairs. The stairs are more clearly visible on one of the lesser st?pas, on the right at the bottom. Standing at the side of this st?pa there is human figure (with folded arms?); above it is another human figure in a similar attitude. There is an archer at the bottom ? with a well defined penis (not uncommon in the representation of warriors in the graffiti of the Upper Indus) ? whose 336 [4]</page><page sequence="5">head terminates in a point (as though wearing a helmet?). On the left, at the place where the ceiling of the shelter slopes down again, one can see pictured two st?pas and an archer. A certain amount of deterioration accounts for the apparent differences between the partial graphic documentation I published (Nazir Khan 1994) and that presented in the Note. In particular, in the first group, one can see that the st?pa on the right still clearly showed traces of the steps at the time I made the initial record, which have since disappeared (ibid.: fig. 4); again, looking at the first group today, very scanty traces remain of the pendant garlands which once hung from the chattr?vali of the st?pa with the mounted archer beside it (ibid.: fig. 3). In the central group, the stairway of the st?pa can hardly be seen today, which was previously complete (ibid.: fig. 10); lasdy, the line of three horsemen has totally disappeared (ibid.: figs. 7-9), as well as the figure of the archer (ibid.: fig. 15) which, already at the time of the original documentation was in a very poor state of repair. (A.N.K.) Fig. 5 - View of the path from Kafir-kot to Marano tangai showing the Saffar Pass with the steps cut in the rock. (Photo by L.M.O.; IsMEO Dep. 17916/24). Shamo The paintings at Shamo (Fig. 13) are also inside a natural shelter, open on the north side, and of similar dimensions and depth to the preceding one (Fig. 4). There are no traces of artificial interference. However, the shelter's greater exposure to the elements has meant that the weather is responsible for obliterating many of the paintings. These were painted with red pigment. Today, three sections of the original composition can still be made out: one section (Fig. 13.1) on the wall at the back, a second (Fig. 13.2) on the left-hand side of the vault, and a third on the centre of the vault (Fig. 13.3). In the first section there is a group of warriors represented by two archers in the act of drawing their bows and facing to the right, a horseman also facing right, and a considerably larger figure wearing a wide-brimmed helmet, possibly armed with a sword and holding a shield in the left hand (?). There is only a quadruped in the second section, most likely a horse. In the third, there is a st?pa of [5] 337</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 6 - On the Saffar Pass: the passage cut out of the rock. (Photo by L.M.O.; IsMEO Dep. 17916/26). which the recognisable elements are the pilaster strips which divide the panels of the base with its stairway, the upper storey surmounted by the anda fully blocked in with colour; above it one can discern the details of the chattrdvali and the garlands hanging down at the sides of the st?pa. (L.M.O.) Marano-tangai The paintings at Marano-tangai (Fig. 14) are completely different in character and subject matter from those at the other sites. These decorate a small cave, open on the NNE side, formed by a huge, partially inclined block of granitic gneiss; here too there are no signs of artificial intervention. A red pigment was used for the paintings. The subject they illustrate is particularly enigmatic as they consist of a series of squares, some have a dot in the centre, others a vertical median line intersected at the centre by a shorter horizontal one, yet others have slightly differing distinguishing marks. The composition looks like a 'planimetric' design of a series of buildings or monuments (Nazir Khan 1994: 215), although a pictographic or symbolic reading is not to be excluded. So far I have been unable to find other comparable material either to prove this hypothesis or to formulate others. It should be noted that the paintings at Marano-tangai are close to a sacred area, almost within it, and only a few 338 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 7 - The ruined s*?p* at Chuwa.

The discovery of these tanks, possibly used to prepare working materials such as plaster, clay, etc., can certainly be compared to analogous discoveries, for example near the Amlukdarra sacred area in the Karakar Valley, also in Swat (Di Florio et al. 1993). (L.M.O.) Hinduano-hatai The paintings at Hinduano-hatai (Fig. 16) are also in a natural shelter, open on the SE side, in a calcareous cliff which dominates the village of Binjanr (Fig. 3). They certainly must have appealed to the fancy of the Pathans as they gave this grotto ? as L.M. Olivieri remarked to me ? the curious toponym of hinduano-hatai (meaning 'the workshop of the Hindus' in Pashto). Inside the shelter a number of figures have been individuated. For the [9] 341</page><page sequence="10">FT Fig. 13 The paintings at Shamo: section; 2, second section; 3, third se (Drawing by L.M.O.; scale 1:10). 1, first sake of convenience we have grouped them into four sections: the first, corresponds to the paintings on the right-hand wall on entering . (Fig. 16.1), the second, to those painted on A/v the left wall (Fig. 16.2), the third, somewhat hidden, to those on the far wall (Fig. 16 J). I T ^ The fourth section is situated in an inner * cavity linked to the front one by a narrow passageway (Fig. 16.4). Here, in contrast to the other sets of paintings, two pigments were utilised, and both are different from those employed in the other sites, one is a reddish-orange tone and the other is yellow. Nevertheless, the figures retain a monochromatic quality, even though the reddish-orange colour on the st?pas in the second section appears to have been applied over the yellow and vice versa in the designs of the third group, where the yellow appears to have been laid over the reddish-orange, as we shall see later. There are three st?pas in the first section: of one of them it is possible to make out the base, the second storey, the anda filled-in with yellow paint and the components of the chattrdvali; of the second st?pa only part of the chattrdvali is recognisable, while the third, smaller in size, retains part of the base, the anda and the chattrdvali. The second ^ section represents a distinct st?pa with the base ^^r^^ decorated with pilaster strips, supporting the ^^^mP af}4a capped by the chattrdvali. On the right, V \ vestiges of two chattrdvali indicate that there were once two more st?pas. These images appear to have been painted by putting the reddish-orange colour over a layer of yellow paint. Above and below the st?pas there are two, not easily recognisable figures, both painted yellow. The figure at the bottom could either be an upright human figure or a horseman (cf. Bemmann &amp; K?nig 1994: T. 29, 25:20). At the top there is a simple circle surmounted by a faint suggestion of a crescent. The third section is of special interest from the point of view of technique. This actually concerns the marks resulting from the cleaning off the some excess pigment from the tips of the fingers once the painting was finished. This proves that at least the paintings at Hinduano-hatai were worked with the fingers. In fact, the thickness of the marks left by the fingers is the same as that of the pictures conserved in the shelter. Moreover, some of the finger marks are yellow while others are reddish-orange, 14 - The paintings at Marano-tangai. (Drawing by L.M.O.; scale 1:10). 342 [10]</page><page sequence="11">but in certain examples the yellow has been laid over the reddish-orange which goes to prove that the colours were applied at the same time in the paintings of the second group. In the fourth section there is a st?pa with stairs, its two storeys are coloured in whereas the anda with the chattrdvali is shown in contour; the other figure is difficult to interpret but it may be a human figure.

Chemical Analysis of the Pigments The substances used as colouring matter in the rock paintings under study are obviously to be sought among those naturally present in the locality, easily obtainable, and extractable by simple means. A preliminary distinction should be made between organic substances, for example the pigments extracted from vegetable matter (flowers or plants) or animals (insects, molluscs, etc.), and inorganic substances (minerals), prevalently oxides, hydroxides or salts from pigmentary minerals that can impart a colour. The analytical procedures necessary to identify the chemical structure of organic substances are very complex and must in any case take into account the state and the amount of the material to be analysed. The samples of the pictorial material under examination are from three of the sites only, because the samples taken from the Shamo shelter could not be used for our purpose. The other four test samples from Kafir-kot, Marano-tangai, Hinduano-hatai reddish-orange and Hinduano-hatai yellow, available in tiny quantities (a few milligrammes), showed a high content of siliceous particles from the rock surface of the particular shelters which house the paintings, and from which they could not be physically separated. In addition, they appeared to be faded and in part oxidised. Therefore it was not possible to test them by conventional analytical methods for identifying the organic substances eventually present in the matter. For this reason the analyses have been focused on the second category, the minerals ? in this case the state and the amount of the samples do not present insurmountable difficulties for the determination of small amounts of the metals contained in the materials. In fact, tin 343</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 16 - The paintings at Hinduano-hatai: / 1&gt; first section; 2, second section; 3, third / / g section; 4, fourth section. (Drawing by 1 lYu L.M.O.; scale 1:10). the atomic absorption spectrometry method for determining metals has, among others, the characteristics of a high sensitivity (very little material is needed), a high specificness (that makes it virtually impossible to confuse one metal with another), and the possibility to effectuate quantitative determinations: that is, to establish for each metal identified the per cent found in the material analysed. Such a possibility is of fundamental importance to us; in 2 fact a simple identification would have given us a list of all, or nearly all, the metals on the earth's crust, even though present in infinitesimal quantities. On the other hand, only a quantitative analysis can guarantee the significance of the presence of a given metal in the matter being analysed, allowing us to consider it only if present at a concentration high enough to determine (either in the form of a substance or salt) the colour of the material under examination. The main difficulty in carrying out an analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry is the preliminary treatment of the material containing the metals. In fact, if these are present in the original local samples (soils, mud/clays, rocks, etc.), they will result included in the organic fraction as cations or complexes, or as insoluble salts. For the purpose of analysis, metals have to be solubilised in a water-based solution. The sample must therefore be treated in such a way as to obtain the total disgregation of the organic fraction (oxidation), and contemporaneously the full solubilisation of the inorganic residue containing the metals. The common tests used and described in manuals and literature (Angino &amp; Billings 1967; Christian &amp; Feldmann 1970; Coleman et al. 1992; Dabeka &amp; McKenzie 1992) refer to soil samples, food stuffs, biological tissues and employ concentrated acid solutions (nitric, sulphuric, fluoridic acids) and high temperatures. The material analysed, being of a prevalently siliceous-inorganic matrix, has required a process of the type described but considerably more drastic, necessary to obtain the full solubilisation. The most common metals forming inorganic coloured compounds have been identified in the following: chrome (Cr), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) (Weast 1968), and the analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry has therefore been directed at determining these elements. 344 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Samples Chromium % Lead % Copper Iron % Cobalt % Manganese Nickel % Kafir-kot Marano-tangai Hinduano-hatai (red-orange) 0,0013 0,0063 i 0,0065 0,0004 &gt; 0,0008 0,0010 ? 0,0023 11,86 ' 0,0063 0,73 | 0,0021 | 0,076 j &lt; 0,001 1,10 ; 0,0014 I 0,005 I 0,003 0,04 | 0,0025 j 0,010 j 0,004 Hinduano-hatai (yellow) 0,0032 0,0028 ! 0,0110 2,20 I 0,0004 0,107 0,009 Fig. 17 - Table giving summary of the analytical data obtained from the samples of pigment expressed in percentage w/w. (Drawing by M.V.). The table in Fig. 17 gives the results obtained, expressed by weight/weight percentage of each metal in the relative material. The data pertaining to the sample from Kafir-kot must be considered as net, because it was possible to analyse separately part of the rock wall which was free of any traces of pigment in a blank test and the results obtained were then subtracted from those relative to the actual sample (pigment plus wall). The results of the other samples were obtained instead by a single analysis of the material, because it was not possible to separate them physically from each other. Based on the percentage of the metals registered in Fig. 17, it is possible to draw the following conclusions. In general, the following are considered to be pigmentary: the oxides, hydroxides or oxidised salts of the Fe oxidation state III (Fe3 +) for the red colour and of the Fe oxidation state II (Fe2 +) for the yellow-orange colour, and the Pb oxides for the colour yellow-orange. Mn (a black-violet colour or a dark yellow according to the composition) can influence, but not determine, the different shades of colour. Cr, Cu, Co and Ni, in the recorded percentages cannot determine any coloration of the material. In particular, as far as the samples from Kafir-kot and Marano-tangai are concerned, both in red pigment, they can certainly be considered as pigmentary of the Fe3 + category, very probably as ochreous hematite (Fe203). In the reddish-orange sample from Hinduano-hatai Pb is without doubt the pigmentary agent (~12% in the sample), almost certainly like minium (Pb304), that shows a reddish-orange colour. Minium is often present, through natural oxidation, in surfacial deposits of Pb carbonates or sulphides. The yellow sample from Hinduano-hatai owes its colouring component to composites of Fe2"*" and probably more particularly to the hydroxide Fe(OH)2 or limonite, typically yellow in colour. Lastly, the addition of a binding agent of an organic nature, serving as an adhesive, has been hypothesised in the composition of the pigments because it has been noticed in other similar examples which have been recovered in an excellent state of conservation. (M.V.) [13] 345</page><page sequence="14">Conclusions As shown above, it is clear that the expression of the pictorial representations at the sites of Kafir-kot, Shamo and Hinduano-hatai is comparable both in style and subject matter. In making even a preliminary attempt to probe their meaning here, it would be best to take the most complete and largest of the three compositions first, i.e., Kafir-kot, for the time being leaving aside the enigmatic abstractions at Marano-tangai. Although, to simplify the description, the paintings at Kafir-kot have been divided into three groups, we are in fact before a unified composition that was almost certainly executed at the same time and by the same hand. On considering the composition as a whole it becomes apparent that it is rather a faithful reproduction of a Buddhistic sacred area, showing the central st?pa and the minor monuments around it. As already noted, this fidelity is attested to by certain architectural details characteristic of st?pas, such as the stairs leading up to the top of the first storey, the decorative motive with pilaster, the harmikd, the components of the chattr?vali like the spacers of the umbrellas and, lastly the festoons and garlands. All these elements, which recur in the three cycles of paintings mentioned above, have real counterparts in architecture. For example, as regards the spacers of the umbrellas, an important model is provided by the sacred area of Panr I (Faccenna et al. 1993: 285 ff., 321-22, figs. 113-14) (Fig. 18). The st?pas of the type represented at Kafir-kot, Shamo (the st?pa in the third section) and at Hinduano-hatai (the st?pas in the first, second and fourth sections), and especially those with pilaster on the base, sometimes with a flight of steps, a second storey and an anda, have secure chronological comparisons in the Swat Valley with the 'type Y at Panr (First Period, second half lst-2nd centuries A.D.; Faccenna et al. 1993: pi. VIII) and with the 'late type 1,2' at Butkara I (Period 4/1,2, 3rd-mid 4th century A.D.; Faccenna 1980-81: pi. X). Regarding analogous architectural representations, some rock engravings in the upper reaches of the Indus are of particular interest: among these those at Chilas I and Thalpan Bridge stand out (Jettmar 1982: figs. 4, 9.2, 11.1; Thewalt 1985: figs. 7-14), those at Hunza (Dani 1985: fig. 39), and at Baltistan (Jettmar 1990: fig. 6). With reference to such architectural details as the base with decorative pilaster strips, the representation of the harmikd, the steps, the ornamental festoons and garlands, these can be compared with the graffiti found in the upper reaches of the Indus (Jettmar 1982; 1987; 1989; Dani 1983a; 1983b; 1985; 1987; Fig. 18 - Reconstruction of a chattr?vali. Faccenna et al. 1993: fig. 114). (Afte 346 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Thewalt 1985), at Chitral (Stein 1921: figs. 4-5) and with those in Ladakh photographed by G. Tucci in 1935 (Orofino 1990). On the contrary, for the complex shape representing an elongated form with hornlike extremities, recorded at Kafir-kot, only a tentative identification can be made. The most meaningful element is the presence of a base decorated with pilasters: this is indicated by an oval, similar to the representation of the storeys of some st?pas situated in practically inaccessible parts of the shelter, as in this case. The storey above the base is an elongated block filled-in with colour as though to emphasise its importance (like the central st?pa at Kafir-kot). The cylindrical trunk branches out at the end, almost like horizontal and vertical antennae. This image, in my opinion, has a marked affinity with the so-called 'st?pa derivates' (Jettmar 1980: 151-99; 1985: 767, fig. 13) (Fig. 19), which A.H. Dani interprets as 'temples' (Dani 1983: 192-94, 220-29). These seem to be analogous to certain 'stepped st?pas* culminating in a trisula, depicted in the graffiti at Baltistan (Jettmar 1987: 808, fig. 9), at Oshibat (Chilas) (Bemmann &amp; K?nig 1994: T.26, 18:220, 223, 225-27) and to similar mchod-rten in the engravings in Ladakh (Orofino 1990: figs. 13, 15). In our case the image resembles a votive column more than one of these 'st?pa derivates': for example refer to the representation of a column near the st?pa at Chilas II (Thewalt 1985: fig. 6; also see Faccenna 1986) (Fig. 20). Another extremely interesting but hermetic design represents a 'disc with a cross surmounted by a crescent'. There are very many examples of this emblem, interpreted as 'shields', among the graffiti to be found in the upper Indus (Jettmar 1982: pis. 7, 12-14; 1989: pi. XXVIIIb). However, the crescent placed above the disc and the two divergent, oblique lines placed beneath it bring this image closer to a different subject. In fact, if we look attentively at the 'circle surmounted by a faint suggestion of a crescent' in the second section of the paintings at Hinduano-hatai, we will see a slight but not improbable resemblance to the 'disc with a cross' at Kafir-kot. The likeness becomes more evident on comparison with other examples. Among the engravings at the Hathano-kandao site, a little South of Kafir kot, for which possibly too early a date has been ascribed, there is a representation of a disc placed on an upside-down 'T' (Nazir Khan 1983: fig. 8). Some similar figures which are not easy to decipher have also been found scratched on rocks at Oshibat (Bemmann &amp; K?nig 1994: T.22, 18:129; 31, 43:1, 50:4, 61:8). At Hunza, on the so-called 'Sacred Rock' an analogous representation has been discovered, but with the upper termination ending in a moon-shaped sickle, which has been identified as the so-called tamgha of the Indo-Parthian King Gondophares (Dani 1985: fig. 16; also see Jettmar 1992: 25-26, fig. 4): which leaves room for the hypothesis that it could be a tribal Signum (!). (*) For the semantic value of the Signum, see Bussagli 1985. This symbol is also represented in the rock reliefs of Ardashir I at Firuzabad, in Iran. In this relief the caparison of the horse and the quiver of Prince Shapur, portrayed fighting, are decorated with a nisan similar to that of Gondophares, where different but analogous heraldic emblems are part of the decoration on the caparison of the horses and on the quivers of two other dignitaries: the so-called 'Sasanid page' and Ardashir himself (Ghirshman 1962: figs. 163, 165-166; for this refer also to von Gall 1990: 24). Another comparison can be made with the anthropomorphic drawings interpreted as masks (such as the graffiti at Ziarat and Chilas ? in the Upper Indus Valley ?, at Tuva ? in Southern Siberia ?, at Helamshan ? in Ninxia ?, depicting masks; these latter dating to the Bronze Age (Francfort 1991: figs. 9, 10, 13, 23) (Fig. 21).

Fig. 21 - a, so-called tamgha of Gondophares (after Dani 1985: fig. 16); b, disc from Hatiano-kandao (after Nazir Khan 1983: fig. 8c); c, mask from Chilas (after Francfort 1991: fig. 10); d, nisan on the caparison of Shapur's steed in the relief depicting the 'Victory of Ardashir' at Firuzabad (after Ghirshman 1962: fig. 166); e, tamgha of Gondophares on the reverse of a coin (after Bussagli 1985: 113, fig. 3). The last subject concerns the human figure. As we have seen, at Kafir-kot, there are two types of human figure: the more numerous category, found at Shamo and at Hinduano hatai, depicts warriors armed with a bow in a warlike stance, at times equipped with a conical helmet; archers on horseback, in one case shown in the act of shooting an arrow to the rear, according to the Scythian and Parthian practice; in a single example, at Shamo, there is an image of a warrior with a brimmed helmet, sword and shield. The second category is represented by two figures only, in the Kafir-kot cycle, both probably with folded arms. At Oshibat, near Chilas, an engraving has been discovered depicting four figures in this attitude (Bemmann &amp; K?nig 1994: T.34, 25:A) which has been interpreted as a dance scene (ibid.: 90); the scene is completed with hunting motifs. The position with folded arms, as noted in Buddhist sculpture 348 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 22 - Graffiti on the Zendan at Pasargadae. (By courtesy of Mr G. Mancini who took the photograph). in Sri Lanka (but also in India and in Gandh?ra; Devendra 1956: 136) represents a sort of 'attitude of respectful attention as if waiting for some sign from the chief (Devendra 1956: 135). These figures, by comparison with the others of the same cycle, are placed within the sacred area and perhaps, at Kafir-kot at least, portray the monks of the sacred area. In general, in all three of these cycles being studied, there is an obvious connection between the figures of the warriors and the monuments of the Buddhistic cult. At Kafir-kot this connection is characterised by what might almost be called a syntactical quality if not actually a narrative one. In fact, in the vast repertory of the rock drawings found in the upper Indus, warriors and st?pas are often represented, but generally, even though placed near each other, they remain distinct and separate. They may occasionally be superimposed, but it would seem without any syntactical association between them, except for when the human figures ? also of warriors ? are represented in worship or in the act of making an offering. The narrative characteristics noticed at Kafir-kot lend themselves instead to a different interpretation. Nor are these characteristics absent from the other two cycles, at Shamo and Hinduano-hatai, where the images that have survived must surely be interpreted as the remnants of much larger compositions which are no longer complete. In my opinion, even though this is true only for Kafir-kot, the three series of paintings may well represent 'historic' episodes commemorating either the conquest or defence of Buddhistic sacred areas by bands of armed men belonging to one of the nomadic populations, a people of archers and horsemen (Saka, Parthians, Central Asiatic tribesmen?) although they could also testify to the devotion of those warriors (cf. Jettmar 1993: 112, for some petroglyphs at Hodar, near Chilas). [17] 349</page><page sequence="18">Of especial interest is the presence of the tribal Signum. At Kafir-kot this emblem actually dominates the centre of the composition. Could the paintings have been the work of one of the protagonists of those events? It is not an easy question to answer: if one seeks to answer it in the affirmative, one might imagine the people who executed the paintings at Kafir-kot and at Shamo, (always supposing they are, as seems likely, individual works), to be the two considerably larger figures (in which case the compositions would have a dedicatory nature). From the point of view of the chronology of the paintings described so far (but excluding those at Marano-tangai), and given the series of elements examined, they may be dated to between the 1st and 4th century A.D. (see also the date proposed for the two reliefs from Kafir-kot, now in the British Museum, which have been ascribed an approximate date between the 1st and the beginning of the 2nd century A.D.; Marshall 1960, cit. in Nazir Khan 1994: 214-15). Stylistically our paintings are clearly linked to those of the Upper Indus, and more especially to those engravings in the primitive 'anhistoricaT style characteristic of so many of the graffiti even of the late historical period (2). The results of the analyses carried out on the sample of the pigment used in these sites (excluding Shamo) would appear to be of particular interest. As shown above, this pigment (2) These pictorial representations show a very close stylistic relationship with the nearby graffiti at Hathiano-kandao (Nazir Khan 1983), whose attribution to a proto-historic date should perhaps be reviewed at this point. Besides these there is a whole series of rock engravings in the middle stretch of the Indus which, from a stylistic aspect, exhibit a close affinity with our paintings. For example the graffiti at Attock (King 1940; Foucher 1947: 387-90, pi. XXXIXc; Gordon 1958: 111-12, pi. XXIII) were dated to the beginning of our era on the basis of certain epigraphical characteristics connected with the kharosthi inscriptions; the engravings at Tor-derai ? which broadly speaking may be included in this area (Said Qamar 1986) ? the chronology of these should also be reviewed, as in my opinion they are too early when compared with others and with the annexed kharosthi inscriptions; the rock engravings at Kashmir-Smast, near Sanghao (Mizuno et al. 1962: 12, pi. XXX j; Tusa 1986: 486, fig. 8); the rock paintings at Seri Mergul and Salabat caves (Siran Valley, Hazara Division), recently discovered by Mr Gerhard Payr (Siran Forest Development Project, GTZ); and lastly the rock paintings in red pigment and white at Pishora (Dani 1983a: 22 ff.; 1983b: 6). A little further away from this zone, but still in the area adjacent to our paintings, are the graffiti at Chitral (Stein 1921: figs. 5-6); and although they are definitely different in character and style one can include the pictograms at Chargul (Foucher 1947: 389-90, fig. 39; Gordon 1958). One can try to assemble all the examples quoted into a culture of rock art which, as formerly suggested by D.H. Gordon, can be loosely denominated as 'the rock art of the middle Indus'. This type of rock art, which has distinctive characteristics, presents a variety of symbols in common, and is very widespread in Central Asia, deserves to be reconsidered in its entirety. Engravings (and, to a lesser extent, paintings) showing a stylistic affinity are in fact to be found in Ladakh, in the upper reaches of the Indus, in Baluchistan, Ghur and Samangan. Even farther afield there are some examples which could be included in this catalogue, such as the graffiti engraved on the prospect of the Zendan at Pasargadae, in Fars. On the external facade on the right of the monumental entrance to the building (6th century B.C.) a series of graffiti can be observed which are very similar to those of the Upper Indus, both from the point of view of style and inspiration: ibexes, moon-shaped shields, battle axes, horsemen and archers (Fig. 22). These particular graffiti have been almost totally overlooked in even the most recent studies which have dealt with this monument (cf. Stronach 1978: pi. 100b). 350 [18]</page><page sequence="19">shows an advanced state of oxidisation which goes to prove without a shadow of doubt the antiquity of the paintings. The pigment, which was probably originally immersed in a binding organic type of emulsion that has long since disappeared, had a metalic base and, in fact, a similar composition has been registered in the sample taken from Kafir-kot and Marano-tangai. The results obtained from the data relative to the samples taken from Hinduano hatai were different. Such differences (as well as similarities) however should be seen in the perspective of the possibility that the compounding of such pigments was linked both to the availability of the necessary metals as well as to their casual production on demand. In this context it is still significant that the paintings at Hinduano-hatai (which, it will be remembered, were found in another valley) were executed with a lead-based pigment that gave it a chromatic component tending more to orange (in the red) besides making the production of a yellow pigment possible. Such a datum should be borne in mind when doing further research which may provide an explanation, from the geological viewpoint, of the reasons for this differentiation. Up to now, the problem posed by the 'enigmatic abstractions' at Marano-tangai has been evaded. Actually, to date none of the data in our possession, whether derived from possible comparisons or close observation of the paintings, is able to throw any light on these inscrutable images. All the same, two factors may provide a clue: the proximity to the sacred area and, more especially, the type of pigment used. As stated above, since the metallic ingredients in the samples taken were probably extracted from the lithic material available, the components present a qualitative affinity with those of the sample from Kafir-kot, but in the absence of a stylistic link this does not constitute a proof. The first factor, rather than elucidating appears to distinguish them, since the paintings at Marano-tangai, as mentioned above, are the only ones to be situated practically within the sacred area (to which hypothetically they can be chronologically related). To conclude none of the features in these paintings shows any similarity or possible connection with the other three. This being so, it is almost impossible not to formulate the hypothesis that the paintings at Marano-tangai have some kind of magic or ritual value. However, despite this we are not able to decipher its character, origin, motive or meaning. In concluding this Preliminary Note one further observation should be made concerning these paintings which represent, even today, an unicum in the artistic production, including rock art, of Buddhist Swat: namely, that it has been noted at Kafir-kot, only four years after the first documentary record was made, that even the person who executed the complete set of tracings was not in a position to understand some of the figures or part of them, previously noticed, due to their radical deterioration. Evidently the paintings have undergone and continue to undergo a rapid and destructive process of oxidisation that could, in only a matter of years, cause their total disappearance. It is hoped therefore that, apart from scholars, this brief Note may be taken as a serious appeal for a constructive conservation project to protect these paintings, otherwise destined to fade away together with the secret of their conception and of their meaning, to which no more than a tentative key is provided here.
