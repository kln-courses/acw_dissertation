Edited by Margot Wittkower. Thames and Hudson. £16.00. wittkower' s power of exposing the strands of history which lead to works of art makes us half expect a subtle web of allusions to his own development in the title, contents and arrangement - the mere bibliographical detail - of this fourth and final volume of Collected Essays. The closest companion to Idea and Image : Studies in the Italian Renaissance is evidently Studies in the Italian Baroque (1975), which in the series falls between Palladio and English Palladianism (1974) and Allegory and the Migration of Symbols (1977). The whole series consists of unfinished projects which branch out and gain underlying coherence from the author's two great studies in the iconography, proportion and perspective of Western art: Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (1949) and Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600-1 y 50 (1958). In comparison with all these predecessors Idea and Image is oddly heterogeneous. Discussions of different kinds of art from many points of view in a variety of scholarly styles (lectures, articles, a published university thesis, a museum monograph) provide at best a random sample of the author's work. The title Idea and Image suggests a final synthesis of a lifetime's study or at least arouses expectations of a general view akin to E. H. Gombrich's Art and Illusion. But instead these essays seem to adopt the Protean forms of history itself and are unified only by their opposition to any over- reaching theory of art (be it Formalist or Freudian, Marxist or Ges- talt) which is not based upon original facts. Each problem to be solved is called forth by the historical contexts of works of art. It is therefore surprising that essays written on these principles over a period of almost fifty years have not been arranged in order of publication. Instead we proceed through studies of Michelangelo's architecture, a book of architectural drawings, theories of propor- tion, matching bas-reliefs by Desiderio da Settignano, paintings by Raphael and by Giorgione, the combined media of the 'Sacri Monti' chapels and finally (the earliest essay) a Veronese school of painting. To encounter each branch of art in turn in this timeless way creates</page><page sequence="2">IDEA AND IMAGE 25 1 the impression that apart from matters of detail the author is exempt from the historical conditioning he consistently described. Although it was Margot Wittkower, the author's widow and editor, who chose this format, the essays themselves point to the same paradox. Aby Warburg pioneered what Wittkower spoke of as 'a historical method which placed the work of art in the totality of its cultural setting'.1 With scientific open-mindedness Warburg showed that many disciplines were relevant to art history. After the Warburg Institute came to London in 1933 its members exposed the faults in much current thought about art. 'What was new was the kinds of texts and documents, the juxtapositions of material that were of- fered (that startling arrangement of the library), new kinds of questions.'2 Their aversion to one-sided or emotive kinds of art criti- cism was confirmed, no doubt, by the totalitarianism that had caused their flight from Germany. The questions which they asked effec- tively challenged assumptions about the way history affects art. Belief in the Spirit of Age, held by followers of Alois Riegl, implied that traditions have a mystical life of their own which manipulates artists as if they were puppets. On the other hand, there persisted in the criticism of Bernard Berenson and Roger Fry a Romantic belief in the unique creativeness of the individual artist which gave license to personal, unhistorical responses to art. Such beliefs de- prived art of its symbolic power by divorcing it from reality. War- burg's students, following 'his polemics against the autonomy of artistic developments and the unconnected spontaneity of artistic creation or against the overrating of purely formal criteria for the understanding of works of art',3 argued that artists create a raison d'être for their work by reacting to their historical situation and modifying the artistic conventions available to them. Each conven- tion contains emotional and conceptual possibilities which claim the artist's attention just as the possibilities of words captivate poets. These possibilities are then combined, transformed and real- ised in the process of making images. A work of art, therefore, does not possess unity merely on account of its physical cohesion. It is like a piece of language whose words must be understood before its syntax can communicate. As conventions change, so do the artist's options and the kinds of meaning open to him. Gombrich summed up the Warburgian approach in a poignant example when he wrote 1 The Artist and the Liberal Arts : an inaugural lecture delivered at Uni- versity College , London (1950), p. 3. 2D. J.

Other kinds of criti- cism pale before such knowledgeable, knowing assertion, but it is possible that the historian's hunt for precedents is often conditioned more by the work of art than is the work of art by the precedents he discovers. To continue the analogy with language, if we consider the difference of scale between the process of writing a poem and the process of change in the language from which the poem was created, how effectively do the vast possibilities of the latter set limits to the former? Is 'could not' really stronger than 'would not' in the history of art? 'We all know that the way we see visual images depends on the notions in which we believe,' writes Witt- kower in Idea and Image . Perhaps, then, the 'truth' presented by the modern art historian is partly self-generated. A rift between evaluation and facts in the earliest essay of Idea and Image helps us to stand back from the persuasive rhetoric of later studies. 'The Painters of Verona: 1480-1530' (1924-25) tries to define the character of a school of painting by detailed compari- sons with other local schools. Domenico Morone's group is 'virile' in comparison to predecessors, but narrow and restricted in com- parison to rivals (who receive surprisingly little attention). It would seem that the motive for studying this mediocre subject is to add another jig-saw piece to the total picture of art history (if such a picture exists), to present a model of critical tact in the face of medium worth (if extremes of worth can be fixed), and to draw the moral that inadequate response to important influences causes artis- tic stagnation. Later on, however, this moral is reversed. Whereas Domenico' s group is at first seen as hopelessly provincial, finally 'in contrast to the Liberale-Caroto circle, our group . . . skilfully assimi- lated what they took from others and always kept their own artistic individuality'. The identity of a school may be either weak or strong depending on how comparisons and precedents are used. Wittkower uses two methods of research to verify opinions: the comparison of stylistic mannerisms to pin-point borrowings from other artists and the piecing together of documentary evidence to determine the paintings that am artist could have seen. Each method is supposed to check and supplement the other's findings, but they may also lead each other astray. If merely through the lack of evidence to the contrary we accept 'the natural inference . . . that apart from a stay in Mantua in 1493-4', Domenico hardly ever left his home, then with Wittkower we will prefer to see the boldly foreshortened pair of corpses in the Victory of the Gonzaga over the Bonacolsi as in- debted to a sleeping disciple in Mantegna's Agony in the Garden</page><page sequence="4">IDEA AND IMAGE 253 at Mantua. But as close in form and identical in subject is the fallen soldier in Uccello's Rout of San Romano , the first attempt at such foreshortening. The stiff symmetry of Uccello's painting (then at Florence) creates an effect of secret destiny in the midst of battie, an effect we will miss in Domenico if we insist too much upon his local style. A far more powerful reconstruction of artistic problems and solu- tions occurs in 'Michelangelo's Biblioteca Laurenziana' (1934). Here we feel the full force of Wittkower's special gift for extracting intel- lectual principles from three-dimensional qualities of architecture. This gift is part of his ability to detect breaks - 'significant discrep- ancies' as he called them - between spatial schemes of different pedigrees which artists have meaningfully arranged. This helps us to understand architecture as a dynamic, dialectical process. Witt- kower's reconstruction of the library's history shows us how practical difficulties - the building's many functions, the changing will of the pope, fluctuating budgets - compelled the master to abandon, in- vent, and combine his ideas to achieve an orderly whole. The author conjures up in sequence 'conditions ... of arbitrary necessity trans- formed by phenomenal mental agility'. Such historical reconstruc- tion is posed almost as a moral opposite to restoration. Restoration typically depends upon the erroneous unity evoked by a building's physical remains, hence the dialectical processes of architecture are neglected. The restorer will see, for example, 'the unfinished façade as a homogeneous scheme instead of a half-way stage between one scheme and another'. Such warnings are salutary, yet dialectical patterns recur so con- sistently in Wittkower's work that we wonder if they always lead us to the essence of art. In the same essay he uses Michelangelo's Library as the key example of Mannerist architecture so as to estab- lish Mannerism as the intermediary phase between 'static' Renais- sance and 'dynamic' Baroque architecture. The Library contains contradictory 'static' and 'dynamic' qualities and so adds an extra dimension to the Hegelian scheme of the critic who coined these terms, Heinrich Woelíflin. It seems possible that the Library has been celebrated in terms of a nineteenth-century tradition of art criticism. There is certainly a point at which the dialectical argu- ment borders upon paradox. Relentless logic is ascribed to every stage of the Library's creation, but logical does not seem the right word to describe the resulting principle of 'irreconcilable conflict, a restless fluctuation between opposite extremes' in which 'the mind is faced with unanswerable questions'. Wittkower always maintains a strict dividing line between ob- jective and subjective ways of seeing art. On these grounds he made a concerted attack upon the relevance of psycho-analysis to</page><page sequence="5">254 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY art history in Born Under Saturn (1963). However, when he ren- ders us his own intense description of the Biblioteca's vestibule and staircase he does it subjectively, in terms of their effects upon the spectator. Metaphors of shell, kernel and void are used to define the relationship between stairs and walls, but they also strikingly evoke a psychological state in which an inner object is both treasured and ignored. 'The spectator feels an incessant conflict between the two principles: the walls as shell for a sculptural kernel, and the walls as boundaries of a void.' The oppressive traits of Michelangelo's mind, dimly reflected in the modified dome of St Peter's, Rome, again excite the author in a late article of 1970. The writing con- vinces us on these occasions because we seem to recognise kinds of mental defence and achievement which have not changed as quickly as history and which have more than intellectual effects. We sense the ways in which an artist may have coped with historical forces which may themselves not be communicated in his art. The highly technical arguments of 'The Changing Concept of Pro- portion' (1953, i960) and 'Brunelleschi and "Proportion in Perspec- tive" ' (1953) express Wittkower's recurring nostalgia for a reconcilia- tion! between a priori truths and visual empiricism.4 This Renaissance harmony between abstract ideas and exact images of the world may well explain the title Idea and Image . According to Wittkower the Renaissance artist alone sought truth in external appearances: Medi- eval and modern artists sought it beyond appearances and in the individual mind, respectively. Whenever external reality has been of little account, the geometrical and irrational branch of the Pythagorean-Platonic study of proportions has taken precedence over the rational and arithmetical branch. Wittkower's belief that all theories of proportion are biologically determined by our need to perceive and symbolise the world in 'simple mathematical pat- terns' leads him to condemn modern art as 'a moment of absolute subjectivism'. But at a time when scientific concepts are probably beyond the means of 'simple' representation and when mathe- maticians are seriously interested in the nature of randomness, his attack on Abstract Expressionism seems rashly subjective itself: 'an art based on the hardly controlled incident. As far as painting is concerned, one may talk of the "splash-and-dribble style".' If ear- lier artists were wrongly 'convinced that their specific system of proportion had universal validity', then why, as a historical rela- tivist, should Wittkower object to the relativity of modern art? In later essays Wittkower confirms his view that, due to theories which have fostered the emancipation of the artist, both art and criticism have declined into subjective chaos. The dramatic tab- leaux vivants of Biblical scenes described in ' "Sacri Monti" in the 4 See The Artist and the Liberal Arts , ed. cit.</page><page sequence="6">IDEA AND IMAGE 255 Italian Alps' (1959) are praised for being collaborative, popular, realistic works of art, combining sculpture, painting and architec- ture and firmly rooted in a shared Catholic tradition. But the snobbish distinction between 'high' and ťlow' art created by mid- eighteenth-century aesthetic theory has spoiled them for all but 'the irascible Samuel Butler'. A related modern bias is attacked in 'The Young Raphael' (1963). Because we are 'tainted by modern psychology', we tend to trace a consistent development of charac- ter in a great artist's work. Thus we disregard the total discontin- uity of purpose between Raphael's early imitations of Perugino (based upon the Medieval workshop tradition of following a recog- nised master) and his rapid assimilation after 1504 of the new Clas- sical styles of Michelangelo, Leonardo and Fra Bartolommeo. Along with modern artists we tend to take for granted Raphael's hard- earned achievement as if it had always existed: the freedom to choose and change artistic styles. Vasari, free from our 'metaphysi- cal assumption' and sticking to 'testable facts', is credited with understanding Raphael's different styles and thus joins Woelfflin and Butler as a critic who has kept alight the torch of truth for us to hold. Towards the end of his career, the identity which Wittkower found for works of art was due as much to their history in criticism as to the history of their production. We hardly know whether his increasing preoccupation with critical positions that had helped or hindered him is evidence of self-effacement or self-projection. I believe that both were inevitably involved. Works of art carry enormous amounts of information, but always leave room - parallel to the gaps in what we see, remember and write history about - for our imagination. Psychologists claim that from our earliest days we invest the world with interests which speak back with strange voices of their own. Although we appreciate different degrees of recognition in, say, an anthropomorphic animal film and a scienti- fic experiment, each begins with the observer changing places with his subject. I believe that the peculiarity of art is to comment upon this process and make us conscious of the innumerable ways in which we identify, by identifying with, reality. We build ourselves into the vacant layered planes along the naves of Brunelleschi's churches and into the mellow chiaroscuro of Giorgione's paintings and the pleasure arises from the detached observation of how we are changed in doing so. Wittkower's greatness lies in showing us the corners of art which we cannot see round without knowledge of the past, but this knowledge grows also from ourselves and our reactions to the present. R .
