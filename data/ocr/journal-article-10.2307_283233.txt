Many passages, particularly from comedy and satire, are discussed. Among the Romans the ape was a pet and an object of amusement or satire. It appeared in the punishment given to parricides, and was an ill-omen in dreams. The animal was trained and displayed in public. The name of the ape was used to characterize an imitative person. The early and continued appearance of the ape in Greek literature is paralleled in Roman literature.' Many of the early references to apes in Roman literature are due to the influence of Greek literature-this is especially true in the case of comedy. This Greek influence was by no means the only source of the knowledge of apes among the Romans; in fact their first acquaintance with the ape may have come from a wholly different source. The Greeks learned much about apes from Egypt, but these animals were in general apes with tails, particularly the dog-headed baboon (papio hamadryas),2 which was sacred to Thoth.3 The Greeks also knew of the tailless Barbary ape (simia sylvanus), whose native habitat is the western part of the north coast of Africa.4 The general Greek word for ape, r0flKos, is sometimes specifically used for the Barbary ape I and may have originally been applied to this species. The Romans used two transliterated Greek words for I Cf. "The Ape in Greek Literature"; T.A.P.A. LXVI (1935), 165-176. 2 The terminology used is that of D. G. Elliot, A Review of the Primates, 3 vols., New York, 1913. 3 Cf. Th.

Moreover the Barbary ape was well- known in Etruria; it was used in early Etruscan art quite frequently as a formalized decoration,7 and in a tomb painting of the fifth century the animal was so naturally painted that the artist must have had a real ape before him.8 From this we may conclude that knowledge of the Barbary ape came from contact, either directly or by way of Etruria, with the shores of North Africa, and that knowledge of the dog-headed baboon and the smaller apes with tails came from the Greeks. In the early period Barbary apes may well have been imported to Rome as they were to Etruria. The earliest reference to apes is to be found in Ennius. Cicero, speaking in the person of Cotta, is ridiculing the Epicurean point of view that the gods are anthropomorphic.9 He quotes from Ennius: 10 simia quam similis turpissuma bestia nobis, and continues with the statement that, since the habits of the two are different, the argument from physical resemblance is not valid. It is only natural that the editors assign this to the Saturae. An interesting later echo of this passage comes in Serenus Sammonicus when he is talking of bites by apes- 6 Bonacelli (loc. cit. 346-359) presents a pla.usible argument for this connec- tion. In brief he assumes a Carthaginian word .arim, "ape," from the Semitic harim, "a flat-nosed person." This Punic word, he thinks, was adopted by the Etruscans as the word for ape (oi Kac rovUs 7rtO2KoVs faal 7rapa ro?s Tvppjvo?s &amp;p4Wovs KacXEuoOat, Strabo 13.626). The quality expressed in the Carthaginian word was taken over as simus (Gr. uoLs), "a flat-nosed person," from which is derived the Latin word for ape, simia (or simius). The derivation of simia from simus has often been considered as a possibility. 7 Bonacelli, loc. cit. 360-373. 8 In the Tomba della Scimmia, near Chiusi (Clusium) discovered by FranCois in 1846; Bonacelli, loc. cit. 373-377, P1. xvi 2. 9 De natura deorum 1.35.97. 10 Fragm.

The ape was frequently used in satire and comedy; Plautus supplies us with the most striking instances of the use of the animal.'2 In the Miles gloriosus Sceledrus, the slave of the braggart soldier, makes a discovery in the house next door when he chases an ape over the roof. This ape was a pet which had run away. In the following lines: 13 quod ille gallinam aut coluLmbam se sectari aut simiam dicat, Periplecomenus senex includes the animal among the ordinary domesticated animals, implying that the presence of apes as pets was not uncommon. The statements about the ape whose presence causes a complication in the plot are anything but flattering: uae mihi misero quoi pereundumst propter nili bestiam.14 edepol, Sceledre, homo sectatu's nili nequam bestiam.15 ibi dum condignam te sectaris simiam.'6 As is shown below, the ape was not highly regarded. One of the reasons for this was its propensity to bite. In the Poenulus a man is recognized by the marks of a bite by an ape, which he had received as a child.'7 To the literary passages may be compared a Roman lamp in the Ravestein Museum at Brussels. On it a monkey has broken its chains and seized a nude boy, who shrieks and struggles to break loose.'8 11 De medicina 44.819f (Poetae latini minores iII, ed. Baehrens, Leipzig, 1881, 145). It is interesting to note in this connection that Celsus (de medicina 5.27.1A) deals with bites from apes along with those by men, dogs, serpents, and wild beasts. 12 Cf. E. F.

In the Mercator Demipho senex dreams that he has entrusted a kid (capra) to an ape (simia) with unfortunate results.19 It is immediately obvi- ous to the audience, and soon to Demipho, that the ape is Lysimachus senex and the kid is Pasicompsa meretrix, whom he leaves with Lysimachus. To the reader there does not seem to be any good reason why an ape should take the part of Lysimachus in the dream. But the spectator soon sees the reason-the old gentleman, though rather pleasant in his cynical way, is extremely queer in his appearance, as the reader later discovers from this description of Lysimachus: 20 canum, uarum, uentriosum, bucculentum, breuiculum, subnigris oculis, oblongis malis, pansam aliquantulum. In the Rudens Daemones senex dreams that an ape is trying to seize two swallows: 21 ad hirundininum nidum uisast simia ascensionem ut faceret admolirier: neque eas eripere quibat inde. postibi uidetur ad me simia adgredirier, rogare scalas ut darem utendas sibi. Ego ad hoc exemplum simiae respondeo natas ex Philomela attica esse hirundines. ago cum illa, nequid noceat meis popularibus. atque illa nimio iam fieri ferocior: uidetur ultro mihi malum minitarier. in ius uocat me. ibi ego nescio quo modo iratus uideor mediam arripere simiam: concludo in uincla bestiam nequissumam. 19 Mercator 229-51, 268-70, 272-6. The dream scene in the Mercator is probably a close translation of a scene in the original of the play, the Emporos of Philemon. This is the view of Enk, who discusses the whole question in detail in his edition of the play: Plauti Mercator, ed. P. J. Enk, Leyden, 1932, I 7-21. Enk also argues quite convincingly that this play is earlier than the Rudens, and hence this scene cannot be a copy of the dream scene in that play: op. cit. 7-21, 28-39; cf. W. Beare, Classical Review XLII (1928), 214f. 20 Id. 639-640. Enk's view that Lysimachus has a personal interest in Pasicompsa is unjustified in my opinion: op. cit. I 13-14; II 153-4 (commentary on line 753). 21 Rudens 598-610.</page><page sequence="5">152 William Coffman McDermott [1936 As Daemones later realizes, the swallows are two young women whom he saves from Labrax leno.22 In these two dreams the ape represents two different types of men-the ridiculous and the evil. When the name of the animal is used as an epithet or as a proper name, it may have either meaning, or a combination of the two. In the Trucu- lentus it is an insult: 23 . . . pudendumst uero clurinum pecus. In the Mostellaria it is banter: 24 uide ut fastidit simia. In the Miles gloriosus a slave maid is called Pithecium, a latinized form of the Greek diminutive; 25 in the Truculentus the same name is used for a similar character.26 The fourth act of the Pseudolus contains a character named Simia.27 This case is somewhat different. Here the name seems to be a latinized form of the Greek name lwtlas, but the author in choosing this name for this particular character surely took a sideglance at the animal under discussion, for Simia is a tricky slave masquerading as the orderly of a boastful soldier, a fact which immediately brings to mind the mimicry of the ape28 This use is found also in a fragment from the Temerarius of L. Afranius quoted by Charisius: 29 quis hic est simia, qui me hodie ludificatus est? 22 Id. 771-3 et passim. The dream is not carried out in full, any more than the dream in the Mercator.

Wortmann (op. cit. 17-18) concludes, incorrectly in my opinion, that the name is taken from the Latin word for ape. For this the name of Peniculus in the Menaechmi would be a parallel, but that name, being unusual, is explained by the character when he first appears (77-78)-no such explanation occurs in the Pseudolus. 29 Fragm. lines 330-1; Scaenicae romanorum poesis fragmenta iII, 3d ed., ed.

A later reference in Suetonius refers to an actual character in the time of Nero: 32 cercopithecum Panerotem faeneratorem et urbanis rusticisque praediis locupletatum prope regio extulit funere. The word cercopithecus is an epithet applied to Paneros because of his evil character or his apelike appearance or for both reasons. Laberius in his mime Cretensis introduced an ape as a pet: 33 farmacopoles simium deamare coepit. Martial referred to pet monkeys when he wrote the following label: 34 Gallia Santonico vestit te bardocucullo, cercopithecorum paenula nuper erat. This bardocucullus was a short Gallic cloak with a hood. Such a cloak made for a man would be a long, all-enveloping cloak for a monkey. It is interesting to note here that several figurines of Gallo-Roman manufacture show the animal 30 Fragm. 850; Fragmenta poetarum romanorum, ed. Baehrens (Leipzig, 1886), 255. Cf. Nonius Marcellus 1.43.10-16, who comments on the meaning of uerna. The three words are the last half of a dactylic hexameter. 31 Fragm. 127, Petronii satirae etc.,6 ed. Buecheler and Heraeus (Berlin, 1922), 195. The text of the second line is uncertain. 32 Nero 30.2. Panerotem was deleted by Bentley, who thought the passage referred to a real ape. Hase considered cercopithecum the cognomen of one man who was enriched by usury, Panerotem the cognomen of another who was enriched by estates. Most modern editors (e.g. Ihm, Rolfe, and Ailloud) consider the first word as an epithet of Paneros or Panerotes (so Rolfe). Dessau and von Rohden thought that the man's name was Paneros (cognomen) Cerco- pithecus (agnomen): Prosographia imperii Romani III (Berlin, 1898), 3, No. 63.

The training implied may be not merely the training of a pet, but the training of an animal actor for the theater, a subject to which I return later. At another time Martial mocks a man who has a pet monkey: 37 si Cronius similem cercopithecon amat. The implication here is that the man was as ugly as his pet. This ugliness of the ape serves Juvenal when he wishes to sharpen his thrust aimed at those who desire longevity: 38 deformem pro cute pellem pendentesque genas et tales aspice rugas quales, umbriferos ubi pandit Thabraca saltus, in vetula scalpit iam mater simia bucca. The city here mentioned is in Numidia, where the Barbary ape is indigenous. To Juvenal as to other Romans the extensive worship of animals by the Egyptians seemed ridiculous. Cicero in a famous passage states this point of view without mentioning the ape.39 Juvenal uses Cicero's statement as a basis for a passage condemning the Egyptians, and adds as a crowning touch: 40 effigies sacri nitet aurea cercopitheci. 35 One from Cologne: S.

This baboon has a long tail; hence cercopithecus can easily be applied to it; moreover the ordinary word is ruled out because in the genitive it would present a series of four short syllables, a combination impossible in the dactylic hexameter.4' To Juvenal this worship of an ape was ridiculous; to Cyprian, Prudentius, Rufinus, and other Christian writers it was sacrilegious.42 This species because of its ferocity would not be a good pet; hence it was unusual to find it so used. In 50 B.C. Cicero on a trip met a certain P. Vedius, a debauched rascal to whom Cicero was polite because Vedius was Pompey's friend: erat praeterea cynocephalus in essedo nec deerant onagri. numquam vidi hominem nequiorem.43 Cicero's contempt for Veditis' strange choice of a pet is equal to his contempt for the man himself. At one place in his letters Cicero characterizes Munatius Plancus, whom he hated, as simiolus; 44 Vatinius in a 41 The mummies of monkeys as well as those of baboons have been found, and Strabo (18.812) says that the K$,6OS was sacred at Egyptian Babylon. However, the mummification of a monkey does not prove its sacred character. The word Ki,6OS is not always accurately used; Strabo may be using it for the dog-headed baboon or may have been misinformed, as so many Greek authors were when it came to the minutiae of Egyptian religion. Hopfner thought that the monkeys were not sacred in the temples, but were in private homes, and that Juvenal here refers to a private house: loc. cit. (see note 3), 31. Sir J. G. Wilkinson was inclined to believe, partly on the basis of this passage, that the monkey was sacred in Egypt: The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, new edition by S. Birch (New York, 1878), III 269. Ehrenberg, who was the first to point out clearly and succinctly that the Papio hamadryas was the holy ape of Egypt, recognized that the Kf#OS of Strabo, the 2rt027KoS of Lucian (Juppiter tragoedus 42), and the cercopithecus of Juvenal were in all probability mistakes or substitutions for KVVOKE,aXOs or cynocephalus: C. G. Ehrenberg, "Uber den cynocephalus der Agyptier," Abhandlungen der k. Aka- demie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, physik. Klasse, 1833, 339-343. 42E.g. Cyprian, ad Demetrianum 12; Prudentius, contra Symmachum 2.868; Rufinus, historia monachorum 7.148.

Servilius "simius, non semissis homo"; 45 and Caelius in a letter called Ap. Claudius Pulcher an ape.46 An extremely interesting reference in a late poem of the Anthologia shows the animal low in the scale of animals. This poem by Eucheria, written about the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century of our era, consists of sixteen elegiac couplets expressing the indignation of the writer because of a proposal of marriage from a servus rusticus. The whole poem is an uninspired dilution of three of Virgil's lines in the Eclogues: 17 Mopso Nisa datur: quid non speremtis amantes? iungentur iam grypes equis, aevoque sequenti cum canibus timidi venient ad pocula dammae. Four of Eucheria's lines extend the list of animals: 18 altaqute iungatur vili cum vulpe leaena, perspictiam lyncem simius accipiat: iungatur ntinc cerva asinio, nunc tigris onagro, itingatur fesso concita damma bovi. Keller uses this as a passage to show that the ape and lynx are enemies, which is quite true.49 The contrast is really between animals of a high type (leaena, lynx, cerva, tigris, damma) and those of a low type (vulpis, simius, asinus, onager, bos). The ape is in bad company. Although the ape never had any religious significance to the Romans, it was used as a symbol of ugliness and ineptitude and was often considered a sign of ill fortune. Nero was terrified shortly before his death by a dream in which the hindquarters of a favorite horse were turned into those of an ape.50 That an ape seen in a dream was a bad portent was a belief held by 45A d familiares 5 . 10.1. 46d. 7.12.2. 4 Eclogae 8.26-28. 48 Anthologia Latina No. 390, 19-22; ed.

When Q. Cicero is presenting the Stoic view he says: 54 maximum vero illud portentum isdem Spartiatis fuit quod, cum oraclum ab Jove Dodonaeo petivissent de victoria sciscitantes legatique vas illud in quo inerant sortes collocavissent, simia quam rex Molossorum in deliciis habebat et sortes ipsas et cetera quae erant ad sortem parata disturbavit et aliud alio dissupavit. Tum ea quae praeposita erat oraclo sacerdos dixisse dicitur de salute Lacedaemoniis esse, non de victoria cogitandum. When M. Cicero is later presenting the rational view, he says: 55 simiae vero Dodonaeae improbitatem historiis Graecis mandatam esse demiror. Quid minus mirum quam illam monstruosis- simam bestiam urnam evertisse, sortes dissupavisse? This incident is supposed to have occurred before the battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C. It is suggested that an ape would not have been allowed in the sacred grove, and must therefore have got in by way of the trees in the sacred grove.56 A similar story is told by Cassius Dio as one of the omens occurring in 32 B.C., the year before the battle of Actium.57 As a beast of evil omen the luckless ape was involved in the punishment meted out under the lex Pompeia de parricidis.58 The following is cited in the Digest: 59 Modestinus libro El Lucian, Pseudologista 17.

Apparently such an evil-doer was regarded as no longer human; the animals not only marked this idea, but in addition their presence insured a bloody and painful death. This punishment was used for the first time in 101 B.C. when Publicius Malleolus was so punished for the murder of his mother.60 Juvenal twice uses this punishment to point a thrust in his satires-as is natural, the poet pities the poor ape: libera si dentur populo suffragia, quis tam perditus, ut dubitet Senecam praeferre Neroni, cuius supplicio non debuit una parari simia nec serpens unus nec culleus unus? 6 confer et artifices mercatoremque veneni et deducendum corio bovis in mare, cum quo clauditur adversis innoxia simia fatis,02 This dire role was not the ordinary idea of the ape. The animal, somewhat ridiculous in appearance and actions, plays a part in fable and on the stage. The rather late Latin fables of Avianus are in a large measure mere imitations of the corpus of Aesopic fables in Greek.63 The two which concern the ape are the story of the ape which claimed from Jupiter the prize for beauty for its ugly offspring,64 and the story of the ape which, having twin offspring, loved the one and hated the other, but by its stupidity allowed the one it loved to die.65 60 Livy, Periocha 68; cf. Seneca, de clementia 1.23. 61 8.211-4. 62 13.154-6. 63 For the ape in Greek fables cf. T.A.P.A. LXVI (1935), 175f. 6414. The story is from Babrius 56 (No. 364 in Halm's Fabulae Aesopicae collectae). 65 35. The fable is similar to Babrius 35 and to Fabulae Aesopicae collectae 366, 366b (ed. Halm). Cf. Pliny, H.N. 8.216.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. lxvii] Ape in Roman Literature 159 These fables are in turn copied by later fabulists, who in the main followed the version of Avianus rather than the version of the Greek authors.66 Turning back to the more important and earlier author of fables, Phaedrus, we discover some novel elements in all four of the fables which concern the ape. In one fable we find that the wolf accuses the fox of theft, the fox denies it, and the ape sitting as judge rules: 67 tu non videris perdidisse quod petis; te credo subripiisse quod pulchre negas. This may be interpreted either as clever cynicism, or an unusual kind of indecisive flattery. The couplet is neatly translated by Duff: 68 You, wolf, it seems, ne'er lost what now you claim: I find, glib Fox, you stole it all the same! This fable is taken over by the paraphrasts in later times with changes-more details are added, and the ape develops into a just and truthful judge; all the light humor of the Phaedrian poem is lost.69 Another fable, lanius et simius, is so unusual that it should be quoted in full: 70 pendere ad lanium quidam vidit simium, inter relicuas merces atque opsonia; quaesivit, quidnam saperet? Tum lanius iocans: quale, inquit, caput est, talis praestatur sapor. ridicule magis hoc dictum quam vere aestimo; quando et formosos saepe inveni pessimos, et turpi facie multos cognovi optimos. 66 Cf.

In either case the ape was probably in a cage which was hung up (pendere) on a hook that ordinarily held meat. The customer surely meant in his question "what does it know?", but the butcher (iocans) pretended that the question was "what does it taste like?" playing on the two meanings of saperet. The fourth line means that the taste is as bad as the ape is ugly. A third fable tells an elaborate tale of the lion who made himself king of the beasts and decided to forego the shedding of blood. Soon the lust for blood became too strong, and various animals were called in and eaten. Finally it was the turn of the ape, which (blandus) tried to save itself by flattery. But the lion pretended sickness, called in physicians who prescribed some new food for the lion, and the ape was eaten. The fable is generally considered a satire on the emperor Gaius, from whom even an arrant flatterer (simius) could not escape. This fable is not preserved completely in the manuscripts of Phaedrus-the first nine lines are there (by some editors split in two parts); but the last sixteen are reconstructed by Postgate from a paraphrast.73 A fourth fable tells of the ape and the fox: 14 vulpem rogabat partem caudae simius, contegere honeste posset ut nudas nates; cui sic maligna: longior fiat licet, tamen illam citius per lutum et spinas traham, tibi quam partem quamvis parvam inpertiar. 71 Cf. 0.

For this too there is a long list of later adaptations, which differ only in making the answer of the fox longer and more insulting.75 One fable in the paraphrast, which may represent a lost fable by Phaedrus, tells the story of the meeting of a liar and a truthful man with an army of apes. The commander asked both, "Who am I?" The liar replied, '"'You are a general and these are your soldiers," and was rewarded. The truthful man replied "You are an ape, and these are apes like you," and was punished.76 Here the ape represents the low-born aspiring to position. Apes are naturally comical; hence we might expect to find them trained for appearance as actors on the stage, in the arena, or in less pretentious entertainment. They are men- tioned in Greek literature in this role.77 Martial mentions an ape which wears a jacket, and one which can dodge spears.78 Juvenal when speaking of the woes of a poor man invited to dinner brings in a reference to the exhibition of a trained ape: 79 tu scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit, qui tegitur parma et galea metuensque flagelli discit ab hirsuta iaculum torquere capella. The agger is probably that part of the Servian wall between the porta Esquilina and the porta Collina. Some commentators, following Valla, took this to mean the new recruit taught by the centurion (capella); but the scholiast and most editors consider this a description of an ape, armed and performing on the back of a real goat. The ape may have been a pet owned by one of the praetorian guard or the property of a strolling player (circulator) who put on an open-air show for these soldiers.

The first charac- ter, the bear, may represent a parody of Isis herself. This scene is of course burlesque; so attempts to read any esoteric meanings into it are out of place.8- A similar parody can be seen in the Louvre on a Roman lamp, which shows Ganymede, as an ape, being carried to heaven by an eagle.82 When Claudian attacked Eutropius, the eunuch chamberlain of Arcadius, he likened him to an ape trained and displayed by a boy at a banquet to amuse the guests: 83 quam pulchre conspectus erat, cum tenderet artus exsangues onerante toga cinctuque gravatus indutoque senex obscenior iret in auro! humani qualis simulator simius oris, quem puer arridens pretioso stamine serum velavit nudasque nates ac terga reliquit, ludibrium mensis: erecto pectore dives ambulat et claro sese deformat amictu. To this scene drawn by Claudian should be compared a wall painting from the large peristyle of the House of the Dioscuri at Pompeii.84 In it a boy holds an ape by a leash in his left hand, and wields a whip with his right hand. The ape is dressed in a white jacket with a hood and short sleeves, and stands on its 80Met. 11.8. 81 Bachofen suggested that the ape was included because of the holiniess of the baboon in Egypt. But were that true, the word used would probably have been cynocephalus, since Apuleius was well versed in things Egyptian. J J.

The animal is apparently executing a clumsy dance. Ammianus Marcellinus reports that in eastern court circles Julian, who had just been successful in Gaul, was contemptu- ously referred to as simia purpurala.85 This phrase looks not only to the dressing of apes on the stage but also to a common proverb among the Greeks 7r0O7KOS V rropo'pa.86 A poem by Luxorius in the Anthology from the time of Hilderic, the Vandal king in North Africa, shows a scene taken from some type of public performance: 87 reddita post longum Tyriis est mira voluptas, quem pavet ut sedeat simia blanda canem. quantum magna parant felici tempora regno, discant ut legem pacis habere ferae! The statement about the peace of the times is just as incorrect as the statement that the ape learns the lex pacis-the lex flagelli is the real source of the ape's learning, as we have seen in Juvenal. In art there is much evidence of the use of apes in exhibitions. To be sure in many cases it is difficult to determine whether the scene is due to the artist's fancy or is taken from life. A few examples will suffice to supplement the literary material. A terracotta figurine in the Louvre represents an ape playing a triangular lyre; 88 one from Agrigento represents an ape playing a double flute.89 A silver vase, probably from South Russia, shows a banquet at which two apes are entertainers; one plays a flute, the other an accordion.90 A glass vase in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum at Cologne is in the form of an ape 85 18.11.1. 86 Diogenianus 7.94: Corpus paroemiographorum Graecorum I (Gottingen, 1839), 303. 87 Anthologia Latina No. 330; ed.

In the Latin authors this gave rise to a secondary meaning for the word simia. At times it is a synonym for imitator. Clearcut examples of this usage are from the silver age or later. The most striking case occurs in Seneca rhetor: 95 indignabatur Cestius detorqueri ab illo totiens et mutari sententias suas. "quid putatis," aiebat, "Argentarium esse? Cesti simius est." solebat et Graece dicere: O 7rW07KOs jov. fuerat enim Argentarius Cesti auditor et erat imitator. Pliny the Younger speaks of a book pub- lished by M. Aquilius Regulus attacking L. Junius Arulenus Rusticus and calling him among other things "stoicorum simia." 96 In the beginning of the third century Julius Titianus was called "simia temporis sui, quod omnia imitatus esset." 9 In one much discussed passage this usage of the words simia or simius, meaning imitator, is of particular significance. Horace says: 98 quos neque pulcer Hermogenes umquam legit neque simius iste nil praeter Calvom et doctus cantare Catullum. 91 A.

The setting for these lines is as follows. In the fourth Satire Horace criticised Lucilius, bringing down on his head a storm-particularly, we may be sure, from the poet and grammarian, Valerius Cato, who as a recent editor of Lucilius was particularly annoyed by the criticism. In the tenth Satire Horace answered these criticisms-seriously answering the objections of the real critics who genuinely disagreed with him, and lightly scorning those who attacked from mere personal malice. He pointed out that many of the men who condemned him and upheld Lucilius lacked proper perspective and literary background. These critics should read the Old Comedy and not be content with a mere imitation of Calvus and Catullus. The translation of this passage that I have given above needs some defense. The crux of the question is the meaning of cantare. Literally it means "to sing continually." But just as cano may have many derived meanings, so may canto. Hence there have been various translations. Porphyrio would give a simple, literal translation.99 Modern scholars give a variety of translations: " to talk about " or " to mock "; 100 " to sing the praises of"; 101 "nnachleiern." 102 Since all of these meanings are proper translations for cantare, the solution must be found by seeing what meaning would best interpret the text. No absolute solution is possible, but "imitate" seems the best. Simius seems to imply imitator as in Seneca and Pliny, not physical deformity as the ancient commentators said.'03 The context seems to imply a poet not a singer: if a poet, then an imitative poet.104 99 "Demetrium autem modulatorem," etc., Porphyrio, a. h. 1.

The identification by Porphyrio as Demetrius is an incorrect conjecture based on the juxtaposition of the names of Hermogenes and Demetrius later in this same Satire.105 But there is another factor in this identification. In some manu- scripts there are eight verses prefixed to this Satire which Vollmer and others excise from the main text. These lines, for a long time considered non-Horatian, directly address and attack Valerius Cato, the dean of the neoteric poets. They have been admirably defended by Hendrickson, who con- sidered them to have been an introduction when this poem was separately and privately circulated. When the collected book was issued, Horace, not caring to wound the aged poet, deleted them. These lines were later inserted by some grammarian who obtained a copy of the original issue.106 This case for considering these verses the work of Horace seems very strong. If then we consider the poem a direct address to Cato, simius iste means simius Catonis, and the man would logically be some younger, neoteric satellite of the old poet, perhaps Ticidas.107 Does Horace mean by these lines to condemn Calvus and Catullus? Disagreement on this point is widespread.108 We know that Horace did not sympathize with the theories of the 105 Sat. 1.10.90. 106 G. L. Hendrickson, "Horace and Valerius Cato," Classical Philology xi (1916), 249-66. The epilogue to this poem (78-92) was presumably added for the final publication. The question has recently been discussed again in detail by two German scholars, neither of whom seems to be familiar with Hendrickson's article: M. Rothstein, Hermes LXVIII (1930), 70-83 (who argues for the Horatian character of the eight lines); E. Fraenkel, Hermes LXVIII (1930), 392-399 (who disputes Rothstein's thesis). 107 T. Frank, Classical Review xxxiv (1920), 91-93. He has conjectured that Ticidas is the pen-name of Claudius Aesopus, son of the actor, and that there is just a possibility that Ticidas-Aesopus was our simius iste. 108 E.g. E. K. Rand, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology xvii (1906), 15-30, who considers Horace to be indulging only in genial raillery. Ullman, loc. cit. (see note 100), holds Rand's view. The opposite view is held by Duff and Frank: J. W. Duff, A Literary History of Rome from the Origins to the Close of the Golden Age (2d ed., New York, 1928), 273; T. Frank, Vergil (New York, 1922), 149f.</page><page sequence="20">Vol. lxvii] Ape in Roman Literature 167 neoteric poets, but this difference in theory does not necessarily mean that he would depreciate the ability of the chief poets of that school, even though he would not imitate them as Virgil did. If we remember the general character of apes, we obtain a clue-the ape is a comic imitation of man, simius Catonis (Ticidas?) is a comic imitation of Calvus and Catullus. As Horace might laugh at an ape, and still admire the man, so he might laugh at a comic imitator and still admire Calvus and Catullus.</page></plain_text>
