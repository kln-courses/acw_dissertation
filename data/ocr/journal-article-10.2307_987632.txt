<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SITING OF CLASSICAL GREEK TEMPLES RICHARD STILLWELL NOTE: The four principal articles of this issue comprised the pro- gram Greek and Roman Buildings in Their Settings arranged by Karl Lehmann and given under his chairmanship at the 1954 annual meeting of the Society of Architectural Historians held at Phila- delphia. FROM THE eighteenth century to the present day an in- evitable Romantic essence has clung about Greek temples. It is a Romanticism of distant time, of the very nature of the sites where the ruins stand, and of the picturesque quality of the ruins themselves. No one rounding the high promontory of Sunium escapes the Byronic touch as the wind-scoured columns gleam above the cliff; the temples of Poseidonia bulk solidly on the flat plain which skirts the bay of Salerno; Bassae traces a contrastingly ordered col- onnade against the savage hills of Arcadia and from far off the Parthenon crowns the steep rock which rises out of sprawling modern Athens. It takes an effort to look past these visual experiences and only with much research and no little uncertainty can we restore things as they were when the Greeks created them. Not until this has been done, however, and some picture built up with the aid of painful archaeological piecing- together can we speculate on the Greek approach to the work. It is all too easy to invent a subjective interpretation and all too hard to interpret facts the right way. I do not propose here to advance much in the way of new theory, nor to cover the field with any degree of thorough- ness. I hope only to suggest some observations which should be kept in mind in the course of more thorough study. We must first of all think of a temple as a shrine rather than as a place of worship in the usually accepted sense; sacrifices to the gods were made on the altar which lay in front of the temple. The building itself was thought of as the House of the God, a shelter for the cult statue, and with an anthropomorphic concept of deity this is inevitable. But the house association is no ordinary one. We can trace it back to the concept of the house of the chief, the Great One, belonging to the remote ages when northern tribes came into Greece in the beginning of the second millenium before Christ. It is a commonplace to think of the great megarons of the Achaian chieftans, Tiryns, Mycenae, or Pylos, but these are not the ancestors of the Greek temple; rather, they stem from a common prototype with porch, main room, and often a thalamos behind, which in some classic temples is recalled in the form of an adyton. Some of these early houses were apsidal, as at Thermon, or as in certain terra- cotta models found by Humphry Payne at Perachora. The type is perpetuated in classic times, usually with buildings that have a chthonic association, as at Delphi, or at Corinth where a small oracular temple stands at the edge of the market place near a sacred spring. But the classic temple as we know it from archaic times was a rectangular build- ing. Its development and the many problems associated with it are fascinating but do not concern us here. The problem is the location of the buildings and their relations to their surroundings. The appropriateness of the high place is indicated even in Vitruvius (I, vii) where he states that for Jupiter, Juno and Minerva the sites are to be distributed on high ground, to Mercury, however, in the forum, to Mars outside the walls, and to Venus near the harbor. That this principle was not invariably followed by the Greeks is certain, but for temples to gods who were thought of in human form (as certain heroes in Homer are often, by reverse analogy, spoken of as "god-like") one would normally expect to find them on a rise of ground. The very fact that at Athens a temple on the Acropolis re- placed, we suppose, the traditional great hall of the Myce- naean kings, is perhaps sufficient illustration. But we do not find that temples stood alone and unpro- tected. A wall surrounded the temenos, the sacred area, and within it other buildings might and did occur, just as in the late bronze age the megaron formed the center of a complex which had its surrounding wall, gates, propylaea, and the necessary approaches. The very fact that a high place is chosen makes direct, axial approach difficult and, from a defense point of view, unwelcome. This feature ex- tends in a notable degree to the temples of the archaic and developed times wherever they occupied the sites of earlier, revered, or sacred buildings. An exception to this might RICHARD STILLWELL is editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Archaeology. The Siting of Classical Greek Temples 3</page><page sequence="2">be noted in the case of some of the colonial cities of Magna Graecia where the temples, as at Poseidonia, or at Selinus, stand either on a plain, or on a rather broad, level plateau. We do not know precisely why the Selinus temples were lo- cated just where they are and the city plan, which is of considerably later date than Temple C, at least, may have been adjusted to the already existing buildings. A feature common to Greek temples is their isolation. One can move freely around them. We may note a similar isolation at Tiryns, where the great megaron with the smaller one alongside are, save by accidental accretion, left free on all sides. The isolation of temples is not caused by the fact that in later times peristyles were placed around them, for even when in early stages there was no such fea- ture the small, house-like shrines appear to have been en- tirely free standing. Another familiar feature is that in nearly every case that can be cited a temple is placed in such a relation to its ap- proach that the first complete view which is obtained, save from a great distance, is an oblique one, showing two sides of the building. The axial approach, until one actually goes to enter the building, is virtually non-existent. Doubtless, since the greater usually controls the less, we should say that this arrangement is effected by the placing of the en- trance to the temenos. Before going farther it might be well to lay down certain principles which appear fundamental: First, high ground. This assures that a temple may be seen well from a distance, but the governing factors in the choice are presumably terrain and tradition, working to- gether, and not necessarily the idea of displaying the build- ing from afar. Second, that as one approaches, the temple is largely or entirely obscured, whether by terrain, or by a surrounding wall, or by other buildings. Third, that it is only after entering the gateway to the temenos that the building can again be seen. Fourth, that it will always be seen at an angle so that its three-dimensional quality becomes at once apparent. This has a natural corollary when we recall the highly three- dimensional quality of Greek sculpture. Fifth, that it is the definite, concise form of the building which is emphasized by the process of isolating it in space, a space to which no definitely recognizable geometric form is given. To be sure one may become conscious of an ir- regular space and hence, perhaps, made more aware of the perfect harmony of the building itself. Again a corollary may be taken from classical Greek sculpture where in reliefs there seldom if ever is any background save a wholly abstract one. The setting of figures in a scene, whether architectural or natural, belongs to a later age and goes along with the formalizing of the spaces that are a part of Hellenistic planning. Sixth, and last, is a principle so well known that it need scarcely be mentioned: orientation, in which practically every Greek temple, Bassae excepted, faces east or slightly north of east so that the rising sun may, at the proper season, shine on the cult image. We may now turn to some actual examples. The first will be the Temple of Aphaia at Aigina. The il- lustration (Fig. 1) is from Gabriel Welter's book, Aigina (1938), Fig. 59. The later temple, of the early fifth century, is built over a still earlier building, but it is easy to see that in both periods the relation between propylaea and temple and altar were essentially the same, although there was a marked change in the orientation. Entering the gateway the temple lay in diagonal view to the left, the altar to the right, and at almost an equal angle of vision. Corinth in the sixth century does not, unhappily, tell us too much and thus far no remains of a still earlier temple have come to light below the present one. Here the location is on a ridge of rock which bounds the northern side of the agora, greatly enlarged in Hellenistic and Roman times, Fic. 1. Aigina. Sanctuary of Aphaia. Plan of the Archaic Period.

Here again, al- though the temple dominated the little valley that led down from the fountain of Peirene, it is fairly clear that no at- tempt was made to establish an axial approach and that, perhaps through mere convenience, an angular approach was chosen. The view of the temple may be imagined from an old engraving taken when there were more columns standing than is the case today (Fig. 2). Two of the great religious sites of the Hellenic world are Olympia and Delphi. At the sanctuary of Apollo the ruins of the latest temple occupy the same site as the earlier, and there is no reason to suppose that the approach was ever radically different. Here the winding ramp is inevitable, but the entrance is placed at the southeast corner (Fig. 3) where the temple, rising high on its terrace, is seen at an oblique angle. As one labors under a hot sun up the Sacred Way the temple disappears behind one or another of the many small treasuries which line the approach, only to show again at a bend of the road and once more be cut off by the terrace on which it stood. It is not until the last turn, as we pause to take breath (which perhaps the ancients never needed to do), that the entire building, now at close range, appears. Here the view is almost head on and the ramp that leads to the entrance lies before us. But we may admit that the peculiar nature of the site made anything in the way of formal planning, save for purely practical con- siderations, a virtual impossibility. Olympia presents a different case, however, for here we are dealing with a fairly level area. The "high place" ele- ment is not involved, and surely here we may expect a greater degree of latitude for the architect to set his build- ing. Certainly a restored elevation of the sanctuary, the kind of thing with which building committees are presented nowadays, shows that such an aspect formed no part of the Greek scheme. The old Temple of Hera once housed a statue of Zeus as well as that of his divine consort, but when Libon laid out the new temple in the second quarter of the fifth century he had fairly ample space for his selection of a site, and what he achieved in the way of relating the temple to the main entrance may be faintly suggested in the draw- ing (Fig. 4). The oblique view is obvious, but if we look at the plan (Fig. 5) we are tempted to see still more; the Temple of Zeus is pushed westward far enough so as not to cover the view of the Heraeum. It may be pure accident that the tall shaft of the Nike of Paeonios falls at the angle of the temple and does not cut through it.There was nothing to prevent the temple being placed farther to the north, save that had this been done the view (Fig. 6) from the south- west entrance would probably have obscured the Heraeum; one hesitates to go farther than this. Doxiades, in an inter- esting thesis (Raumordnung in Griechischer Stiidte, Heidel- berg, 1937), attempts to postulate a series of angles or cones of vision, based for the most part on a 30-60 degree relationship; it is a theory akin to some of those which derive Greek proportions from mathematical or geometric formulae. If anywhere in the Greek world of the period under con- sideration we may expect to find the application of optical refinements with regard to the placing of buildings it should be on the Acropolis at Athens. Let us see what there is. The actual location of the three principal temples would appear to be of respectable antiquity-possibly the Parthe- non itself is to be excepted. We are not sure of the location of the palace hall of the early rulers of Athens. Some archaeologists have seen it under the foundations of the Peisistratid temple of the sixth century, and it is a fairly likely place. Lester Holland ("Erechtheum Papers," Amer- ican Journal of Archaeology, 28 [1924]) has shown that there was a sanctuary of Athena Polias under a portion of the later Erechtheum. The siting of the Parthenon was es- .i : 5rl rd,( L*;n sj I ::fs 1 ~* !i ?: : ~~""~" ~:~~ AG :J rs i ~Z= L, i ; ~4gLh~ II L* r ? ~"~.

We know as yet too little about this grandfather of the Parthe- non to be able to say how fully visible it was from the south, but we may be quite sure that from the west, where the ap- proach always lay, it could have been seen only from a very great distance, and from the north would have been even less apparent. Certainly in the sixth century, just as later, the temple disappeared from view as one approached. We must re- member the high, cyclopean wall to the right of the older Propylaea (Fig. 7), a wall which was preserved in Peri- clean times. The southwest wing of Mnesicles' propylaea abutted on it at an angle, and we know from a preserved cornice block that in the last third of the fifth century this wall rose as high as the roof of the wing. Thus there was no view of the Parthenon in its entirety until one had passed through the Propylaea and stood at the colonnade of the east porch. But, in such a restoration as this (Fig. 8), we are apt to be deceived. It is tempting to say with the theorist that this is really what one saw: the main buildings separated by space, trapezoidal, and hence not in conflict with them; the Athena Promachos strategically placed with respect to the Erechtheum (which did not exist when the statue was erected), and an uninterrupted sweep of the rock surface up to the principal temple. To be sure, Mnesicles avoided placing his entrance so that the temple lay on its axis; the terrain is to blame, one may say, but had it not been so it is doubtful whether that fifth-century genius would have attempted any such banal- ity. The axis of the Propylaea is oriented within three de- grees of being parallel to the axis of the Parthenon, but that is the only relation, save that the great temple, or as much of it as could be seen, lay on the usual oblique. There was far more to be seen, however, than what is shown in Figure 8. There seems to have been a rather for- midable terrace in front of the Peisistratid temple, or as much of it as was left after the Persians had sacked the Acropolis in 480. There was also a precinct wall for the Brauronion and for the court of the Chalkotheke, and while the north wing of the building east of the Brauronion prob- ably is later, Gorham Stevens (The Periclean Entrance Court of the Acropolis of Athens, 1936) has traced, without question, a wall which extended along the north side of the Parthenon, formed a terrace, and bounded the Panathenaic way (Plan, Fig. 9). All this would have seriously impaired the view of the Parthenon from the entrance and, if Stevens' restoration is taken as accurate, only the upper part of the temple could have been seen. The first full view would have come after entering through the small propylaea, for which the founda- tion cuttings exist, into the Chalkotheke court. Here, how- ever, we certainly find what appears to be a carefully thought-out plan of "landscaping." The great flight of rock- cut steps which bounded the eastern side of the court seems to have been cut or quarried in connection with the temple, and to have been calculated so as to reveal the entire height of the building from acroterion to crepis. Stevens' sight lines (Fig. 10) would appear to confirm this, and his resto- ration shows what he claims is the first full view of the Parthenon. It is once more our old diagonal view (Fig. 11). This concern with the appearance of a building from nearby and with a normal cone of vision may be paralleled by the observations of George Elderkin (Problems in Peri- clean Buildings, Princeton, 1912) where he pointed out the optical relationship of the windows and door of the north- ....... i0. t0V I bI, 4 ciO S--a. 0 : . ..... \ /?~ g n rrL iI f ......

The east wall of the Erechtheum again illustrates the same principle, and a comparison with an elevation shows that the Greek archi- tect thought of things as they would appear, rather than as a formal pattern on a drafting board. A final example may be given, this time again from the Parthenon. The famous panathenaic frieze which adorned the upper part of the cella could only be seen as one drew fairly close to the building and looked upward between the columns at an angle of about 40 to 45 degrees. It seems more than coincidental that this angle of view is reflected in the rock-cut steps, so that a spectator standing at their foot on the level of the court could obtain a view of the frieze and as he moved up to terrace level would also stand at what might be termed an optimum distance (Fig. 10). Thus there seem to be several points which may be taken into account in this brief survey of the archaic and classic period when we deal with temples and their surroundings. The selection of a high place where one exists is largely due to the tradition of a particular site, or by analogy with the idea of temples being quite properly built on high places. I do not think we can say that it is from desire to enhance the architecture of the building. The approach is never an axial one; after the first view the building disappears until a later, selected moment. That comes, generally, as one passes through the gateway of the enclosure and when this has been done the temple lies to one side or the other at an angle. The oblique view revealing the three-dimensionality of the building is stressed. Other principal buildings in the area generally stand clear of each other, and the spaces between them practically never form rectangles. Such as they are, they are in contrast to the shapes of the buildings themselves. Situations may be complicated by the presence of reserved areas, as on the Acropolis, which the architect might gladly have dispensed with, and we shall probably never be certain of what Kallicrates and Ictinos intended when they built the Parthenon. It is certain, however, that in the final working out of the approach, a solution was found whereby the visitor was assured of one good view before he ascended to the terrace and made his way east- ward to the front of the temple. It is planning of a very high order in that it involves a succession of experiences which were to culminate at last as the visitor stood before the great east door of the temple and beheld for the first time the gold and ivory goddess of Athens.
