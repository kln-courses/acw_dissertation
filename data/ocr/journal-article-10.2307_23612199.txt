It marks the mutual articulations of empire and hyperreality that build signifying distance into imperial forma tions and their discriminatory operations. The Disney empire is one of its most pernicious forms. This article looks to Disneyland to bring simulated imperialism into sharper relief by detailing its three interlocking movements: the signification of imperial processes gen erated by simulacra; the amplification of colonizing projects through simulation; and the interpellation of hybrid subjects between (im)mobility and (in)animation. It takes the It's a Small World ride as its primary example. One of the oldest attractions at Disneyland, it provides a multicultural tour of a metaphorical global village wherein animatronic chil dren, stylized in cultural stereotypes, sing and dance in the name of world peace. Yet this simulated world is one of deceptive heterogeneity. In fact, It's a Small World reveals an idealized world to be one erased of all difference in favor of a white, English-speaking, and culturally American utopia. It thus spatializes the forceful presence of empire within its all-embracing discursive formation. To theorize simulated imperialism using this example is to position empire within the domains of unending semiotic breakdown and the global ized (im)mobilities that presently order our excessive, networked, high-carbon societies. This opens a way to think through imperial formations from the destabilized margins of signification, and from these limits, to search out radical possibilities for subversion and resistance in the spaces between the imperial and the hyperreal.

More accurately, they have been subjugated by the simulacrum of Venice, a mel ancholic city always on the verge of disappearance.1' At first glance, these figures are apt mimics of Italians-as-subjects, trompes-l'oeil, predictably in keeping with colonial discourse.16 As such, they become inscribed into an "Italian" order of things and interpellated as colonized subjects of the hyper real. Not so predictably, however, they also appear to be quite mobile, strolling in silence as perfectly costumed copies of Italians elsewhere, resurrected in the American desert (of the real): mute flâneurs among simulated passages. These hyper real Italian subjects reflect the very work of simulation itself. According to Jean Baudrillard, "the subject is simultane ously itself and never resembles itself again, which haunts the subject like a subtle and always averted death. This is not always the case, however: when the double materializes, when it becomes visible, it signifies imminent death."17 Thus, when confronted with their simulated doubleness — say, by a professor (me) who insists on speaking Italian with them — these gondoliers and carabinieri retreat into a colonial freeze-time, unable to speak or even look one in the eye, met aphorically re-fixed into a world of statues. In one instant, I witnessed the death of the hyperreal subject and the partial return of a colonial one, a figurative reanimation of the colo nial. Simultaneously, I found myself sifting through the on tological borderlands between the mobile, animate, simulated subject and the fixed, inanimate, colonized one: hyperscapes where the hybrid subjects of simulated imperialism inhabit the space between. THE WORLDS WITHIN: EXHIBITION RESIDUES, OR THE SIGNIFICATION OF IMPERIAL PROCESSES In his study of the 1964 New York World's Fair and the first iteration of the It's a Small World ride, Lawrence Samuel speculated that Elias Disney's experience as a carpenter at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair inspired his son, Walt, to create magical universes of his own.18 And magical worlds he did create — from kingdoms (Disneyland), to suburbs (Celebra tion, Florida), to feature films, to an "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (EPCOT). Since the mid-twentieth century the Disney name has become synonymous with simulated worlds — be they microcosmic, animatronic, cel luloid, suburban, or other. These hyperreal worlds constitute the so-called Disney empire. Jean Baudrillard famously commented that Disneyland in Anaheim, California, exists as an imaginary to conceal the fact that we (Americans) live entirely among orders of simulation.19 As he wrote, Disneyland is merely a "deterrence machine" to rejuvenate fictions of a real that doesn't exist; it is a space to regenerate the imaginary, wherein the recycling of "the dreams, the phantasms, the historical, fairylike, legend ary imaginary of children and adults is a waste product, the first great toxic excrement of a hyperreal civilization."20 How, then, might we clarify this imaginary and dissect the differ ential toxicities within it? Rather, one might observe how the imaginarles are mul tiple at Disneyland. Each of its magic lands — future, fron tier, fantasy, adventure — is linked to varying ideas of what is real, and each engages distinctive mechanisms of deterrence and imagination. In Adventureland, the popular Jungle Cruise, one of the park's original attractions (largely unchanged since 1955) circumnavigates a manmade river dotted with animatronic wildlife: hippos, elephants, crocodiles, and even spear-wield ing "natives" ( r 1 g s . 2,3 ). Visitors queue within a boathouse figure 2. (top) An animatronic elephant rushes out of the trees on the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland. figure 3.

Material evidence of the colonizing project is everywhere — supply crates, photographs, ammuni tion, radios. And visitors wind their way through this detri tus before boarding modified riverboat steamers with names like Congo Queen and Mekong Maiden. They then proceed into the wilderness, allegedly never to return ( r 1 g . 4 ). Yet every visitor does return from the simulated "jungle" with its menacing headhunters, and thus temporarily actualizes the fantasy of dominating nature — a fantasy that collapses indi geneity with the flora and fauna around it.21 The point here is that the deterrence and imaginaries at work in the Jungle Cruise are different from those of Disney land's other attractions. It actively perpetuates a fantasy of domination over nature, as played out on a simulated river in a simulated colony — an attempt to recuperate both a colonial real and a mastery of nature that never, in fact, existed. Yet Disneyland is not one, but multiple hyperrealities. Where the Jungle Cruise provides a simulated experience of dominat ing nature, the theme park's other boat-themed attraction, It's a Small World, aspires to nothing less than world cultural domination. World's Fairs as Simulated Imperialist Precedents. Fitting ly, the origins of It's a Small World lay not in the park itself but in an expression of American cultural dominance in the postwar era: the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. As labo ratories of modernity, inventories of the world, and shrines to progress, world's fairs (a.k.a. international and universal ex hibitions) have articulated and embodied complex historical moments and cultural contexts.22 Walter Benjamin famously declared them to be "sites of pilgrimages to the commodity fetish."23 Contemporary scholarship on them is extensive, much of it concerned with exhibitions as battlegrounds of signifying practices.24 n figure 4. The simulated riverboat — here named Congo Queen — is the instrument through which visitors conquer and domesticate pure nature. One of the most ideologically charged practices at these fairs, as Timothy Mitchell's study of visions of Egypt has shown, involved their representation of European colonizing projects.25 Whether along the Rue de Caire at the 1889 Exposi tion Universelle in Paris or within the Libya and Albania pavil ions of the 1940 Mostra Triennale d'Oltremare [Triennial Ex hibition of Overseas Italian Territories] in Naples, these events both created and distanced the colonial object-world from its observer, establishing a simulated reality that was picture-like and legible, and thus able to be possessed. In terms of strat egy, they referenced a world, inert and permanent, outside the exhibition, a world staked on the fixity of its synchronic essen tialism. According to Mitchell, the effect they created "would always appear as though it were a conceptual structure ... an order of meaning or truth existing somehow before and behind what would now be thought of as mere 'things in themselves.' Political authority itself would now more and more reside in this effect of a prior ordering truth."26 Yet in these colonial worlds-as-exhibitions, he added, authority presided without ever really being present, and the political order(s) expressed were never quite accessible. What was novel about these exhi bitions were the ways they rendered abstractions of authority into interlocking representational regimes of objects and order. These worlds-as-exhibitions were simulacra par excel lence, copies of an "original" artificially resurrected under the auspices of the "real." As Mitchell wrote, "everything both imitates and is imitated — there is no simple division into an order of copies and an order of originals, of pictures and what they represent, of exhibits and reality, of the text and the real world, of signifiers and signified."27 These processes of denaturalization and simulation were even more pronounced at colonial exhibitions staged on colo nial soil, such as the Fiera di Tripoli [Tripoli Trade Fair], an an nual exhibition staged in Italian-occupied Libya between 1927 and 1939. The event began as a series of temporary shed-like installations set along Tripoli's seafront esplanade, but it was soon transformed into a sprawling 50,000-square-meter fair grounds of permanent pavilions in a new, Italian-built neigh borhood west of Tripoli's medina ( f i g . 5 ). Similar to the exhibitions staged in the métropole, the Fiera re-created the architectures of quotidian colonial life in situ, from a suq, to metal workshops, to an Arab café, complete with "natives" on display.28 Visitors could observe this cleansed and enframed colonial order of appearance, and then, unlike at the exhibi tions in Paris or Naples, they could walk outside the fair's boundaries to observe the colonial "reality" with their own eyes. Yet Tripoli's built environment had by then been entirely reconstructed — or, technically "recleansed" (ripristino) — by Italian architects. Its streets, buildings and monuments — indeed, the entire plan of the "real" city — had been manipu lated and reformed by Italian colonial administrators since the 1910s.29 Architects and administrators alike had worked to rebuild Tripoli, in part, to conform with an ideal of the Ori ent that had never existed.30 Thus, the city itself no longer</page><page sequence="6">30 T D S R 2 5.1 figure 5.

Forced perspective along Disneyland's Main Street USA.</page><page sequence="10">34 T D S R 2 5.1 figure 7. The It's a Small World ride is overwhelming to eyes and ears. As an illusion, too, Main Street is an idealized construc tion of a small-town America that never was.58 The street was supposedly modeled on Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri (as well as Fort Collins, Colorado, the hometown of Disneyland's first director, Harper Goff). How ever, several scholars have shown that Main Street was more a "mediation of a version of community that was already well established in popular American memory" than a replica of Walt's nostalgic memories for his boyhood home.59 Main Street leads to the space of fantasy (quite literally, Fantasyland), and "the Utopian place to which Main Street USA leads is the fantasmatic return of reality, [a] hallucinatory presence."60 The circuit of nostalgia ends at Cinderella's castle, where other circuits then begin. One opens onto the Actively scien tific futures of Tomorrowland; another to the colonial spaces of Adventureland; yet another to the American West of Fron tierland. Borders are porous, and one may slip in and out of these space-times with little effort. In a far corner of Fantasyland, there stands a blinding white-and-gold edifice reflecting the Southern California sun. From three hundred feet away, one hears a rhythmic ticking, of the sort used by hypnotists. There is also an instrumental version of the famed "It's a Small World" song repeated ad nauseum. Upon closer observation, the source of the ticking is a smiling clockface with pendulous eyes mounted atop the ride's central tower. Its syncopated ticking underlies but does not fall in rhythm with the instrumental song. It is as if the ride deploys two competing forms of acoustic torture upon the waiting crowd in an effort to overstimulate and control them. The sensory assault embodied by It's a Small World is so effective and complete that Disneyland employees have nicknamed it "the Asylum" because of its capacity to drive employees and visitors insane.61 The Imperial Terrain. The gleaming white-and-gold exterior of this self-proclaimed small world represents a two dimensional world in miniature. On the one hand, abstract, geometric forms comprise the exterior — squares, circles, triangles, turrets — set against one another. There are also moving parts — pinwheels and discs — that spin in rhythm to the ticking clock. Visually, the ride's exterior is over whelming; the eye does not know where to look first ( r i g . 7 ). Abstractions of several famous monuments stand out amidst this shimmering geometric collage, among them the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the Parthenon, the leaning tower of Pisa, St. Peter's Basilica, the Tower Bridge, and Venice's cam panile. These are monuments of a "Eurocentric" and "West ern" civilization, but they are also imperial debris symbolical ly abstracted and affixed to the ride's exterior ( r 1 g . 8 ). Each of these monuments signifies an empire of the past: Greece, Rome, Venice, etc. The only recognizable symbols that might be considered "non-Western" are two domes, which could be interpreted as elements of an Ottoman-style mosque (yet another empire). Alternatively, they might recall the archi tecture of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, such as St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow — an association which only reinforces the dominating Occidentalism of this small world. figure 8. Most of the ride's exterior designs are abstract, geometric shapes, but a few distinctly Occidental monuments are immediately recognizable.</page><page sequence="11">HOM: SIMULATED IMPERIALISM While geometric forms overwhelm and disguise these abstracted monuments, the latter foreshadow what is to come in the psychic interior of the ride. Moving from exterior to interior, the small world expands from two dimensions to three, passing from physical to psychic realms. Put another way, the exterior presages the values enriched and condensed within this particular miniature. The glistening white exterior celebrates monuments to Occidentalism — and im plicitly the values predicated upon an imperialist fantasy of a successful, dominant, Western, and particularly American civilization. They are values that espouse racism, classism, violence, and all the other trappings of colonizing projects. In sum, this is a small world — a miniature — where all racial, cultural and linguistic differences have been erased in favor of a white, English-speaking, culturally American utopia. The Spaces of the Small World. To enter this interior, one waits and watches until it is time to board a mechanized boat with a dozen other people and depart for the miniature world inside ( f i g . 9 ). The boat rounds a corner, and in an instant, the blinding whiteness of the exterior disappears into the blackness of an interior tunnel that consumes all. This is the miniature's threshold between outside and inside, light and dark, white and black. At this threshold, a sign declares the ride to be "The Happiest Cruise that Ever Sailed!" This is a preemptory move to set a positive tone for the experi lSEr! v- ^i—.-nja W\ Nt. V 9. Mechanized boats ferry visitors through the small world. figure io. The entry sign announces the "Happiest Cruise that Ever Sailed" and the corporate-sponsored sun implies a vague promise of illumination. ence to come; it is the rhetoric that validates the imperialist fantasy staged inside. Beneath the sign, the logo for Sylvania, a lighting company and the ride's corporate sponsor, is also stamped onto the image of a sun (iig.io). The ride thus implies that illumination is yet to come, another symbolic legitimation of its imperialist values — or perhaps, a compen satory gesture for the moral darkness contained within. The tunnel opens into a cavernous chamber, and the boat is thrust into an explosion of multicolored lights, mov ing stages, singing and dancing animatronic dolls, cruising boats, and repeated musical refrains that bombard the senses. Here, the small world is divided into regions and marked by stereotypes. As arrested, fixated forms of representation, stereotypes deny the plays of difference within psychic and social relations. In this small world, colonial bodies are for ever on display, and the shorthand of the stereotype inscribes them with racial and cultural difference.62 The bodies here are not "real" but mechanized, vivified by microelectronics. They take the form of animatronic dolls —- simulated chil dren — whose stilting movements seemingly resist the fixity of stereotypes even as they perpetuate them in broad strokes. The tour begins in the Arctic, where fur-clad Eskimo dolls sing in Inuit among walruses and igloos. From here, one "sails" to Canada, the Baltics, and Europe. The exterior monuments to Occidentalism get reprised here, and countries are reduced to cultural stereotypes. Italy is Pinocchio, gondo liers, and the leaning tower of Pisa; Holland is a windmill, tu lips and clogs; France is the Eiffel Tower and can-can dancers; Spain equals flamenco guitar; etc. ( f i g . 11 ). Next, the boat leaves Europe and sails to the Middle East, where a visual dis play signals Orientalism to be very much alive in the contem porary. There are snake charmers, flying carpets, a minaret, and belly dancers, all singing the "It's a Small World" song in Arabic. Every female doll wears a veil, as does the sun,</page><page sequence="12">T D S R 2 5.1 &gt; figure ii.

All the diversity of the Middle East and northern Africa is collapsed into a well-worn Orientalist fantasy animated by child-like automatons ( 11 g . 12 ). The circuit continues through Asia, where the displays of cultural stereotypes involve pandas and acrobats (China); a Shinto shrine and kimono-clad dolls (Japan); rice paddies and water buffalo (Thailand); and the Taj Majal and classical dancers (India) ( 11 g . 13 ). The boat next rounds a corner, and a surfeit of animal sounds (highlighted by monkeys) marks its arrival in Africa. Here animals outnumber people. There are hyenas, a rhinoceros, a lion, an elephant, giraffes and monkeys, yet few children. The dolls, black-skinned and dressed in tribal fashions, sing, dance, and make music with the animals ( r 1 g . 14 ). It is the only display in which Wsm HHB FIGURE 13. A kimono-clad doll and an abstraction of a Shinto shrine represent Japan. the dolls do so. A rhinoceros keeps rhythm on a drum right next to a child who plays a flute while straddling a lion. Put another way, the attraction equates Africans with animals, a not-so-subtle expression of racism. Like the Jungle Cruise, it perpetuates a fantasy that collapses indigeneity with the fauna around it. Riders then float out of Africa and into Latin America, the master signifier of which is a giant sombrero. Almost every doll wears a sombrero, and they sing the "Small World" song in Spanish. Like the Middle East, all the cultural di versity of the continent is collapsed into singular stereotypes — sombreros, donkeys, brightly colored rugs — which recall a world that has never, in fact, existed. Pacifica is next on the tour. Comparatively, this is a small display of Polynesian</page><page sequence="13">HOM: SIMULATED IMPERIALISM 37 figure 14. There is a figurative symbiosis between dolls and animals in the display that represents all of Africa. L island cultures, with stereotypes ranging from kiwis to hula dancers. While the Latin America display recalls a nonex istent past, Pacifica references an imaginary past that is, to some extent, "real." This is because it includes Disney car toon characters — Ariel from The Little Mermaid and Lilo and Stitch from the eponymous movie — in reference to a "reel" history accessible to visitors familiar with Disney's cinematic oeuvre. Here, the artifacts of the cinematic screen penetrate the imperialist attitude of miniature, wherein "real" and "reel" subtend simulated imperialism. The United States comprises the penultimate display of the Small World tour. The country is reduced to a single dyad of stereotypes: cowboys and Indians ( r i g . 15 ). In this U. S., a cowboy sits atop a haystack set among a pastoral landscape figure 15. Three Native American dolls in the background welcome the (musical) conquest of the guitar-playing cowgirl in front. of Midwestern farmland. Nearby, a cowgirl dressed in chaps plays guitar against a backdrop that clearly references the Southwest, possibly Monument Valley. Above her, almost marginalized from view, three Native American dolls dance and sing in English. Bedecked in turquoise jewelry and sur rounded by pottery, they welcome the cowgirl with arms out stretched, allowing her to take center stage. It is almost as if they are welcoming her (musical) conquest. The domination of Native Americans inherent in the United States display foreshadows the imperialist conquest implicit in the ride's climax. Here, all the dolls from previous displays become united in a sort of "white wedding" finale (tigs.16,17). They are all dressed in white, and dance and sing in English. The white-and-gold color scheme of this fi nal interior now matches the attraction's exterior, and in this way, inside and out, physical and psychic symbolically realign in space. While ethnic and national types are still grouped together, all cultures on display have been whitewashed, both literally and metaphorically, in a sort of Fanonian reversal. It is a world-in-miniature where racial, cultural and linguistic differences have been erased in favor of a white, Anglophone, Americanized utopia. These are the values enriched and condensed in this miniature. Thus, the ride's built forms and spatial practices impose a simulated civilizing mission upon simulated global populace. It is a mission that advances a fantasy of American imperialism, exactly of the sort imag ined in the mid-twentieth century when the ride debuted at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. As visitors set their pen etrating gazes upon this miniature world, they are put in the metaphorical position of colonizers. In the miniature, this second-order fictive world recalls an irrecoverable space-time that never existed. Likewise, in terpellation is always partial and evasive.

A close-up of the animatronic dolls, now dressed in white and singing in English, shepherded into simulated subjugation. moments, becoming and unbecoming, the psychic embodi ments and intimate residues of imperial formations. Simu lated imperialism complicates the dialectic between colonizer and colonized, which, like the dialectic between outside and inside, "are always ready to be reversed, to exchange hostility," according to Bachelard. "If there exists a border-line surface between such an inside and outside, this surface is painful on both sides."6' In simulated imperialism, the painful border lines of interpellation inhabit the articulation between (im) mobility and (in)animation. It is here, in these ontological borderlands, that new forms of partial and hybrid subjects emerge — short circuits born of a hyperreal imperialist order. THE SUBJECTS OF SIMULATED IMPERIALISM: INTERPELLATION IN THE SMALL WORLD It is fitting that a giant, hypnotic, ticking clock anchors the exterior of It's a Small World, for the clock was the first au tomatic device to be applied to practical purposes ( f i g . 18 ). Walter Benjamin noted that the whole theory of the produc tion of regular motion was developed through the clock.64 He grouped the clock under the category of dolls and automatons, for all possess the bewitching power of automation. It is the motion — or rather, the mobility — that arises from automa tion that enchants. Yet automation, or mechanized mobili ties, interpellates subjects who, for Benjamin, were repulsive. As he wrote: "the evil spell of this slippery path [of automa tion] readily take[s] the form, even today, of large animated dolls." And, he added, "You have no idea how repulsive these automatons and dolls can become, and how one breathes at last on encountering a full-blooded being in this society."6' Automation rules Disneyland's society. Mechanized car riages make their way, driverless, up and down Main Street. On the Jungle Cruise, animatronic elephants spray water at visitors on cue. At Space Mountain, the rollercoaster stops and starts at precise intervals, transporting new groups of visitors into outer space every 2 minutes and 48 seconds. In short, the park could not function without automation. It's a Small World depends on it. The clock's pendulous, anthropo morphic eyes and its hypnotic ticking depend on the mechan ics inside. So, too, do the boats, which, instead of floating through the ride's interior are propelled along a fixed track by well-timed water jets. Most importantly, the crux of the 4% riGURE 18.

It's a Small World exists in perpetual simulation.71 Instead, they belong to a different strategy of motion, yet this motion is completely automated. One might simulating the real, one that does not hinge on clone stories, then ask: if it is a miniature that is not freely mobile, is this but rather on the execution of automated mobilities.72 In but an illusion of mobility?

Alison Matthews David, Bob Davidson, Antonio Furgiuele, John Urry, and Janet Wasko have also been very helpful in thinking through these ideas. I am also incredibly grateful to Nezar AlSayyad, Mia Fuller, and Nelson Graburn for their indefatigable support of my research and professional development over the years. Finally, I wish to thank the many IASTE participants — among them Stefan Al, Mui Ho, and Mrinalini Rajagopalan — for their excellent feedback when all that follows was simply a germ of an idea presented at the 2010 IASTE conference in Beirut. 1.

In 2010, Celebration suffered its first murder, on Thanksgiving — only to be followed by an armed standoff and gunshot suicide one week later. These violent crimes, according to some residents, are cracks in the facade of a self-declared perfect community. In April 2013, a thirty-year-old man was convicted of the Thanksgiving-day murder and sentenced to life in prison. H.P.

The double meaning of utopia raises interesting questions about "the happiest place on earth." In his original description of the term, Thomas More distinguished between the authentic and artificial pleasures of Utopia, and noted that the land's inhabitants "have entered into a conspiracy to call some things enjoyable which are naturally nothing of the kind — as though facts were as easily changed as definitions ... [they] believe that this type of thing makes happiness impossible — because, once you get used to it, you lose all capacity for real pleasure, and are merely obsessed by illusory forms of it." Because the World's Fair, Disneyland, and the It's a Small World ride are all simulacra, they are also all illusory forms that are meant to be experienced and enjoyed by visitors. But is their pleasure a real one, or merely a form of delusion? See T. More, Utopia (London: Penguin Books, 2003), p.74. 45.

Clifford, Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997), pp.36-37. Clifford acknowledged the work of Georges Condominas (1990) on préterrain and Edouard Glissant (1981) on détour and retour as two productive considerations of travel. Préterrain is defined by Condominas as the places that one has to go through and be in relation with in order to get to "the field." Glissant's notions of détour and retour refer specifically to the self-fashioning of postcolonial identities as a series of detours and returns to an ambiguous point of entanglement.
