RATIONALIST PHILOSOPHY The presumed absence or near-absence of what we usually call rationalism  in medieval Ashkenaz raises a series of questions large and small: If  rationalism is in fact absent or largely absent, what accounts for this,  especially in light of recent scholarship demonstrating that Ashkenazic  Jews were exposed to the works and culture of Sephardic Jewry to a  greater degree than we had thought? Should the evidence of such  exposure lead us to conclude that philosophical rationalism was in fact  present among Northern European Jews, an approach that would greatly  diminish the cultural contrast between Ashkenaz and Sepharad? Indeed,  the assertion that new evidence diminishes that contrast served as the  basis for one of Elisheva Carlebach’s arguments against Gerson Cohen’s  thesis that differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic messianism  are linked to different approaches to rationalism.1 If we insist that the  contrast is real, should we assume in light of the new scholarship that  Ashkenazim were in fact fully aware of rationalist ideas but refrained  from utilizing or even addressing them out of motives that they had  articulated clearly and consciously, at least in their own minds? Thus, as  we shall see, several outstanding scholars have accounted for the absence  of philosophical arguments or interpretations in specific Ashkenazic  texts or intellectual endeavors such as anti-Christian polemic and biblical  exegesis by positing local explanations relevant to those discrete areas or  1 Elisheva Carlebach, Between History and Hope: Jewish Messianism in Ashkenaz and  Sepharad: Third Annual Lecture of the Victor J.

Is this the appropriate approach to account for  what appears to be a large, more or less consistent cultural phenomenon?  Finally, should science and rationalist philosophy be treated separately  or as two aspects of the same discipline or mode of thought? Let me begin with a working definition of rationalism (or rationalist)  that I formulated a decade ago in a footnote apologizing for the use of this  “admittedly imperfect term”: “By rationalist I mean someone who values  the philosophical works of non-Jews or of Jews influenced by them,  who is relatively open to the prospect of modifying the straightforward  understanding (and in rare cases rejecting the authority) of accepted  Jewish texts and doctrines in light of such works, and who gravitates  toward naturalistic rather than miraculous explanation.” I hastened to  add that “I do not regard this as a rigid, impermeable classification.”2 If we work with this understanding of rationalism, we will find it very  difficult to endorse a fundamental reassessment affirming Ashkenazic  openness to the philosophical culture characteristic of medieval Sephardic  thinkers. Yes, a paraphrase of Saadya’s philosophical work influenced a  certain sector of Ashkenazic Jews. Yes, as Ephraim Kanarfogel notes in  this volume, opposition to anthropomorphism characterized this and  arguably other sectors of Ashkenazic Jewry, and one might be inclined  to describe such opposition as a reassessment of the straightforward  understanding of accepted texts. Yes, one can find references or figures  here and there that evince familiarity with philosophical works and may  even allude to characteristically rationalist positions. But the instinct  that tells us that the rationalist inclinations delineated in this definition  are for the most part alien to Ashkenaz is not an antiquated scholarly  prejudice. Exceptions remain exceptions; allusions remain allusions;  rejection of anthropomorphism is not in itself rationalism; and the  reading of a few books does not necessarily alter deeply entrenched  modes of thought. Ashkenazic culture was initially formed in a Northern European  Christian environment largely innocent of a philosophical tradition,  at least of the sort that fits the model that we have been utilizing. As  Christian Europe became exposed to that tradition, it began to change,  2 “Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times,” in Gerald J.  Blidstein, David Berger, Sid Z. Leiman, and Aharon Lichtenstein, Judaism’s Encounter  with Other Cultures: Rejection or Integration?, edited by Jacob J. Schacter (Northvale,  N.J. and Jerusalem, 1997), pp. 62-63. — 153 — </page> <page sequence="3"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response although even then the dominant expression of scholastic thought  remained considerably more conservative than the strongly rationalist  strain of Arabic and Jewish philosophy. The major figures of Ashkenazic  Jewry are very unlikely to have read Latin, and so the inner workings of  nascent and even mature scholasticism were largely closed to them. More  to the point, whatever exposure Ashkenazic Jews may have had to the  philosophical works of Sephardic Jews in Hebrew translation came after  their cultural profile had been largely formed.  At this point, it is worth turning to the controversy surrounding  a book to whose fundamental insight I subscribe even as I remain  uncertain about its concrete theses. In 1985, Charles Radding published  a study entitled A World Made by Men that aroused a brief but vigorous  tempest. His essential argument was that Europeans in the early Middle  Ages thought and acted on a moral level that corresponds not to that  of modern adults but to one or another of the levels that Jean Piaget  ascribes to children. Inter alia, he noted that they disregarded intent  in evaluating the seriousness of a crime. Some of his critics argued that  it is simply impossible for early medieval Christian legislators to have  dismissed the significance of intent since they read and revered the  Bible, where intent is an important element in determining the gravity  of a crime and its appropriate punishment. Moreover, as Radding  himself pointed out, Augustine and other patristic figures whom the  medieval legislators considered authorities also ascribed significance  to intent. It seems to me, however, that this argument, which affirms that  people who believe in certain books will necessarily internalize the  values in those books, does not accord with psychological reality. Peoples  that developed certain modes of thinking during a lengthy formative  period do not quickly undergo a fundamental transformation because  they embraced a belief in a text that reflects a different perspective.  It is much easier to adopt a new doctrine than a new conception of  reality, of the world order, and of modes of thinking and arguing. To  the degree that Radding succeeded in pointing to data demonstrating  that the mentalité of pre-twelfth-century Europeans really exemplified  the moral perception that he attributes to them, the fact that this  perception is not consistent with that of the Bible or of Augustine does  not undermine his thesis. If this point is correct with respect to Christian works that were seen  — 154 — </page> <page sequence="4"> Polemic, Exegesis, Philosophy, and Science: as transcendentally authoritative —and I realize that I have essentially  asserted the point rather than proven it—it follows that we should not  resist the possibility that Ashkenazic Jews could have been exposed to  Sephardic philosophical texts, nodded in agreement with some though  surely not all of their arguments, and continued to think along lines  that remained entirely alien to the spirit of those texts. I note in passing  the even more far-reaching argument by Haym Soloveitchik that at least  in their pietistic mode, hasidei Ashkenaz somehow managed to remain  unaffected by the most basic concepts of the midrashic worldview that  permeated the liturgy and the essential construction of collective Jewish  identity.3 To return to our concerns, a highly instructive case in point  emerges in two articles by the pre-eminent scholar of the medieval  philosophical debate between Jews and Christians on the nearly complete  absence of philosophical polemic in Ashkenazic works preceding the end  of the thirteenth century. PHILOSOPHICAL POLEMIC In the first of these articles, Daniel Lasker sets forth the evidence for  the absence of such polemic while simultaneously demonstrating that  some anti-Christian philosophical arguments were known to Ashkenazic  authors even in the early period. Thus, the paraphrase of R. Saadya’s  work was available, but its philosophical arguments against Christianity  leave no trace at all.4 Nestor ha-Komer was mined, but its philosophical  material, to which we shall return, usually was not. In his first article,  Lasker explained the phenomenon with a formulation that I endorse:  3 Soloveitchik, “The Midrash, Sefer Hasidim and the Changing Face of God,” in Creation  and Re-Creation in Jewish Thought: Festschrift in Honor of Joseph Dan on the Occasion of  His Seventieth Birthday, ed. by Rachel Elior and Peter Schaefer (Tuebingen, ca. 2005). 4 Upon reading the typescript of this article, Yehuda Galinsky remarked in an email  message, “A trace there is, even if barely,” pointing to R. Moses of Coucy’s Sefer  Mitzvot Gadol, positive commandment #2, where we find a citation from Saadya of  a philosophical argument against multiplicity in God. When I brought this to Daniel  Lasker’s attention, he was grateful for the reference but noted that the passage cited  is not among Saadya’s more sophisticated arguments. I would add that R. Moses of  Coucy, unlike the vast majority of Ashkenazic rabbis, spent significant time among  Sephardic Jews. In any event, the passage is surely of interest, but, as Galinsky’s careful  formulation indicates, it does not change the larger picture. — 155 — </page> <page sequence="5"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Most Ashkenazic Jews were not familiar with ‘Greek wisdom’; even the  intellectuals among them were generally not fluent in philosophy. There is  no reason to believe that a polemicist, who addressed his book to a Jewish  audience which itself was not philosophically sophisticated, would use  arguments which even he would regard as foreign.5 At the end of the article, he succinctly captures what I see as the  key point, although I am uncomfortable with the level of familiarity  with philosophical arguments that he ascribes to Ashkenazic Jews. “The  lack of a Sephardi style full-scale philosophical critique of Christianity  in Ashkenaz was not a function, then, of Ashkenazi ignorance. It was  a result of a totally different intellectual outlook.”6 I do not think that  Ashkenazim had the knowledge needed to launch a full scale philosophical  critique, but I do think that their distinct intellectual outlook accounts  for the almost total absence of philosophical arguments.7 Several years later, however, Lasker extended a greater level of  generosity to Ashkenazic polemicists, and here the tendency to assume  that familiarity with texts must penetrate an individual’s psyche leads to  a position that grants the authors of these works a greater philosophical  orientation than I think they had. In the second article, he reiterated  some of the evidence surveyed in the first, but this time he argued that  it was primarily the Ashkenazic audience that had “a totally different  intellectual outlook from that of Sephardic Jews.” Because of this different  outlook, “the Jewish polemicists felt that their audiences would not have  responded well to the same type of philosophical argumentation that  appealed to the Sephardic Jews....The classics of Ashkenazic polemic... all play down any possible philosophical critique of Christianity. To a  great extent, it was the audience, and not so much the author, which  determined that fact.”8 5 Daniel J. Lasker, “Jewish Philosophical Polemics in Ashkenaz,” in Contra Iudaeos: Ancient  and Medieval Polemics between Christians and Jews, ed. by Ora Limor and Guy Stroumsa  (Tuebingen 1996), pp. 197-198. 6 ibid, p. 212. 7 I made a briefer version of the argument in the preceding paragraphs (beginning with  the discussion of Radding) in “Ha-Meshihiyyut ha-Sefaradit ve-ha-Meshihiyyut ha- Ashkenazit bi-Yemei ha-Beinayim: Behinat ha-Mahloqet ha-Historiografit,” in the  Avraham Grossman Festschrift, which should have appeared before the publication of  this volume.

The Ashkenazic polemicists and their audience  inhabited the same cultural world, and very little in it resonated with  Sephardic style philosophical argument. It is far from clear that an  intellectual chasm separated the composers of polemical works, who  stood a cut or more below the intellectual elite of Ashkenaz, from their  literate readers, and some members of that audience stood above them.  Moreover, numerous passages in Ashkenazic polemical works make it  clear that the authors were not writing solely to bolster the morale of  their Jewish readers. To a significant degree, they were providing manuals  to be used by Jews in real confrontations. A Jewish polemicist would  have to think twice or thrice before depriving the most capable segment  of his audience of arguments that would have the greatest effect in an  actual exchange with Christians. Our first assumption should be that the  philosophical arguments in question did not resonate with the authors  any more than with their audience. An examination of one of the few examples of Ashkenazic  philosophical polemic before the fourteenth century will, I think, reinforce  this assumption. The author of Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, working with an  argument reflecting the direct or indirect influence of Nestor ha-Komer,  addressed the question of whether Jesus was the incarnation of just one  person of the trinity or of all three. Nestor and other Jewish polemicists  objected to the possibility that all three persons were incarnated by  insisting either that this would constitute an impermissible separation  in God—assuming the partial incarnation of each of the three—or, in  the event of the complete incarnation of all three, that it would mean  that God is limited.9 For the last argument from the infinitude of God,  the Nizzahon Yashan substitutes the almost amusing question, “Who was  in heaven all that time?” supplemented by “Who ran the world during  the three days when they were buried and none of them was either in  heaven or on earth?”10 I suppose that one could argue that the author  9 For an excellent survey and analysis of these arguments, see Lasker, Jewish Philosophical  Polemics Against Christianity in the Middle Ages, 2nd ed.

See too my discussion in Appendix 5 (“Who Was  — 157 — </page> <page sequence="7"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response intentionally changed the argument because he did not believe his readers  would understand the point that the incarnation of all three persons  would limit God. This is not, however, such an intellectually challenging  argument; a Tosafot passage of average difficulty is considerably more  daunting. I am much more inclined to assume that the author himself, who  shows no signs anywhere in his lengthy work of thinking in philosophical  terms, naturally shifted into language that was more congenial to his  instinctive pattern of thought. WISDOM, TORAH, AND RATIO We turn now to a very recent article regarding biblical exegesis by one  of the towering scholars of medieval Ashkenazic Jewry where I think  we encounter an unwarranted reluctance to adopt a straightforward  explanation of a phenomenon rooted in the traditionalist rabbinic  mentality of that culture. Avraham Grossman has argued that Rashi’s  commentaries to Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job 28 evince a striking,  tendentious commitment to understand “wisdom” (hokhmah) as Torah.11  This is the case, he says, even though the plain meaning generally  points to straightforward human wisdom. Since Rashi’s approach  presumably requires explanation, Grossman suggests two possibilities.  The first begins with the contention that Rashi’s familiarity with the  works of Sephardic grammarians makes it difficult to assume that he  was not also familiar with the ideas of Sephardic thinkers and those  Babylonian geonim who engaged in speculative pursuits, even though  such familiarity is not attested in France until the works of Rashbam  and especially of Bekhor Shor. Thus, Rashi may have been attempting  to guide his readers away from such philosophical rationalism. The  second explanation, which Grossman considers more plausible, is that  Christians, at a time when polemic had reached one of its peaks, were  beginning to use arguments from reason in their exchanges with Jews,  and Rashi wanted to keep his readers away from an enterprise that could  lead them to religious doubts.

(Alon Shevut, 2007), pp. 13-27. — 158 — </page> <page sequence="8"> Polemic, Exegesis, Philosophy, and Science: For Grossman, the reason for preferring the second explanation is  not because of any deficiency in the first. Rather, it follows from the  emphasis in the uncensored version of Rashi’s commentary on Proverbs  on the dangers of Christianity, which he identifies as the seductive  woman who appears so frequently in that work. Since the commentary  focuses so often on this danger, and since wisdom understood as Torah  is presented as the antidote to the blandishments of the seductress, it is  reasonable to assume that concern with the Christian appeal to ratio is  what motivated Rashi’s insistence, in the face of the plain meaning of the  text, that wisdom in fact refers to Torah with absolute consistency.  Grossman of course points to Anselm as the prime example of a  contemporary of Rashi who utilized dialectic in a theological context, but  the example that he supplies illustrating the polemical appeal to reason  by Christians is the assertion that the exile demonstrates that the Jews  have been rejected in favor of the True Israel. There is really nothing  particularly new about this, and if I were to argue for the late-eleventh  and early twelfth-century utilization of ratio in a specifically anti-Jewish  polemical context, I would be more inclined to cite Odo of Tournai’s (or  Cambrai’s) Disputatio contra Judaeum Leonem nomine de adventu Christi  filii Dei, which reports what is likely to be a real exchange in which Odo  argued for the logical necessity of Jesus’ sacrifice for the forgiveness  of sin.12 This work, virtually alone, provides a serious evidentiary base  for the self-conscious, explicit appeal to ratio by a Christian polemicist  in France who engaged in actual exchanges with Jews more or less  contemporary with Rashi. Before proceeding, let me note that the issue before us, as I hope  we shall see, has considerable methodological significance beyond  its specific context. Moreover, historians in the last several decades  have ascribed many cultural practices and literary phenomena in late  antique and medieval Jewry to the influence of the Jewish-Christian  confrontation. These range from midrashic passages to significant  elements of the Passover Haggadah to the evolution of life-cycle rituals  to the motivation of peshat exegesis as a whole to specific exegetical  observations, and the assessment of these assertions has in some cases  12 See On Original Sin; and, A Disputation with the Jew, Leo, concerning the Advent of Christ,  the Son of God : two theological treatises / Odo of Tournai, translated with an introduction  and notes by Irven M. Resnick. (Philadelphia, ca. 1994). — 159 — </page> <page sequence="9"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response produced a mini-literature.13 Avraham Grossman’s oeuvre is generally a  paradigm of caution and sober judgment, and his essay on the influence  of the Christian context on Joseph Kara’s commentaries is one of the  most convincing and insightful studies in this scholarly genre.14 To the  degree that my reservations about his position in our case are persuasive,  they may serve as a salutary reminder of the occasional need to resist  inappropriate utilization of an often valuable and persuasive scholarly  approach whose seductive attractions can sometimes penetrate the  defenses of even the greatest and most responsible historians. It seems to me that in evaluating a thesis proposing an extraneous  motive for a particular exegetical position, we need to begin with two  fundamental questions. First, how compelling is the argument for seeking  such a motive? Put differently, can the exegetical position be accounted  for without undue strain by straightforward considerations emerging out  of the exegete’s culture and approach to text? Second, how persuasive  is the extraneous motive? These considerations work in tandem. If the  proposed motive is highly plausible, we may entertain it seriously even  if there is little reason to seek it. If it is not particularly persuasive, we  may decide that internal considerations suffice even if we began with a  sense of dissatisfaction that sent us searching for external motivations. In our case, I am not inclined to go far afield. With respect to the  first question, Rashi’s position can be explained to my satisfaction on  the basis of traditional Ashkenazic mentalité without recourse to other  considerations. With respect to the second question, I am not persuaded  that Rashi was likely to have been motivated by concern about Sephardic  hokhmah or Christian ratio. Is Rashi’s emphasis on hokhmah as Torah really problematic? It  indeed stands in some tension with what moderns and even some  Jewish medievals considered peshat. Rashbam (or the commentary to  Job that incorporates material from Rashbam) pointedly comments that  according to the peshat, the term hokhmah in Job 28:12 refers to hokhmah  mammash (literal wisdom) and not to Torah. 15 For Rashi, however, whose  13 I have commented on some of that literature in “A Generation of Scholarship on Jewish- Christian Interaction in the Medieval World,” Tradition 38:2 (Summer, 2004): 4-14. 14 “Ha-Pulmus ha-Yehudi-Nozri ve-ha-Parshanut ha-Yehudit la-Miqra be-Zarfat ba-Me’ah  ha-Yod-Bet (le-Parashat Zikato shel Ri Qara el ha-Pulmus),” Zion 51 (1985/86): 29-60. 15 Sarah Yafet, Perush Rabbi Shmuel ben Meir (Rashbam) le-Sefer Iyyov (Jerusalem, ca.  2000), ad loc. — 160 — </page> <page sequence="10"> Polemic, Exegesis, Philosophy, and Science: immersion in the world of midrash was deeper and in large measure  taken for granted, we need to ask whether there were powerful enough  reasons in the text itself to impel him toward other interpretations. First we need to consider the weight of the midrashic tradition.  Prof. Grossman refers to midrashim that understand hokhmah as  Torah in Proverbs and elsewhere, but he argues that Rashi could have  chosen other midrashim. This is a familiar and often valid argument,  but in this case, even a casual look through the midrashic and other  rabbinic materials reveals that the equation of Torah and hokhmah is  simply overwhelming. It made its way into the liturgy and is treated as  virtually self-evident. Moreover, key passages in Proverbs discuss Torah, commandments  (mitzvot), and wisdom (hokhmah)—as well as the righteous and the  wise—in closely linked contexts. “The mouth of the righteous produces  wisdom (hokhmah)” (Proverbs 10:31). One especially instructive example  is 7:1-5:  My son, heed my words, and store up my mitzvot with you. Keep my mitzvot  and live, my Torah, as the apple of your eye. Bind them on your fingers;  write them on the tablet of your mind. Say to Wisdom (hokhmah), “You are  my sister,” and call Understanding a kinswoman. She will guard you from  a foreign woman whose talk is smooth. Modern biblical scholars will say that Torah here and elsewhere in  the Wisdom Literature refers to the teaching of the sage and the mitzvot  to his directives. But to medieval Jews—including rationalists—Torah is  Torah and mitzvot are mitzvot. Ralbag on this passage writes as follows:  “My son, heed my words” in your heart. These are the stories of the Torah  and the commandments of the Torah. Put them away with you to observe  them. “Keep my mitzvot and live”: The mitzvot of the Torah, so that you will  attain eternal life. And keep my Torah as you keep the apple of your eye.  It is, moreover, not sufficient that you keep the mitzvot in your heart; you  must bind them on your fingers to do them... Now it is true that when Ralbag comments on the next verse about  wisdom he does not continue to speak of Torah, but the connection  between the two in this passage is so intimate that we can hardly  expect Rashi to have felt a peshat-driven impulse to seek a different  — 161 — </page> <page sequence="11"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response interpretation. Thus, when the passage proceeds to speak of how wisdom  protects against a foreign woman, it is more than natural for Rashi to  identify this wisdom as Torah. And so we come to two revealing passages that Grossman cites.  Proverbs 2: 10-16 asserts that wisdom can save its bearer from an alien  woman. Rashi affirms that the foreign woman is  A gathering of idolatry, i.e. heresy. It is not plausible that the verse speaks of  an adulteress literally understood, for how is it the praise of Torah... that it  protects you from a foreign woman and not from a different transgression?  Rather, this refers to heresy and idolatry, which constitutes throwing off  the yoke of all the commandments. Similarly, on Proverbs 6:24, which says, “It will keep you from an evil  woman, from the smooth tongue of a foreign woman,” Rashi remarks,  The Torah will keep you from an evil woman...We must conclude that  Solomon was not speaking of an evil woman but rather of heresy, which is  as weighty as everything. For if you will say that this refers to a prostitute  in the literal sense, is this the entire praise and reward of Torah that it  protects against a prostitute and nothing else? There is, however, a key distinction between the passages. In the  first case, the verses speak of wisdom, but in the second they speak of  Torah. The verse preceding 6:24 reads, “For the mitzvah is a candle, and  Torah is a light,” which of course even ibn Ezra and Ralbag understand  in accordance with what any medieval Jew would have considered the  peshat. It is also noteworthy that Ibn Ezra, though he understands Torah  here as Torah, inserts a reference to wisdom without any textual basis.  The Torah, he says, gives light, while the fool walks in the dark; thus, the  way of life refers to wisdom. In this passage, at least, Torah and hokhmah  are intertwined, virtually identified with one another, even for ibn Ezra.  Even more striking is a passage in Ralbag’s commentary where, as Prof.  Richard Steiner noted to me, the rationalist exegete tells us that wisdom  in a series of verses (Proverbs 3: 15-18) that the Rabbis had famously  utilized in their encomia to the Torah very likely means precisely what  the Rabbis assumed.16  16 Prof. Steiner also notes that the identification of wisdom and Torah is already present  in Ben Sira 24. — 162 — </page> <page sequence="12"> Polemic, Exegesis, Philosophy, and Science: Two highly relevant points emerge from this discussion. First, the  parallels between passages on wisdom and on Torah are so close that an  exegete with a strong predisposition to follow rabbinic precedent would  have little reason to seek an understanding of wisdom different from  that of the Rabbis. Second, it is extremely revealing that in his comment  on the passage in chapter 2 where the biblical text speaks of hokhmah,  Rashi demonstrates that the foreign woman is idolatry or heresy using  the same argument that he does when the text speaks of Torah: “Is this  the praise of Torah,” he asks, that it saves you from a harlot? But you  do not prove something on the basis of an interpretation that itself  requires proof unless you have so internalized that interpretation  that you simply take it for granted. It appears that Rashi did not even  consider the possibility that the reader might say, “Wait a moment.  How do you know that the verse here is referring to Torah?” Rashi’s  assumption could result in part from the similarity between chapters 2  and 7; as we have seen, 7:2 refers to “my Torah,” which Rashi would have  taken in the traditional sense. Still, for Rashi, the equation of wisdom  with Torah appears to have been foundational, not just ideologically  but psychologically. If this is true, as I think it is, we need to be very  hesitant about assuming that he rejected the non-Torah explanation in  an exegetical campaign inspired by external concerns.17 Let us now turn very briefly to the proposed external concerns. There  is little or no evidence that Rashi was sufficiently aware of Sephardic  rationalism for him to have provided a tendentious interpretation of  hokhmah in order to protect his readers, who probably needed no such  protection, from its baneful influence. What then of the dangers of  the Christian use of ratio? Despite Odo of Tournai, the evidence that  the recent introduction of this category into the lexicon of Christian  polemicists had come to Rashi’s attention is tenuous at best. Even the  later Ashkenazic polemics do not address ratio as a category. When the  author of the Nizzahon Yashan, writing two centuries after Anselm,  addresses the Christian explanation for the incarnation, he deals only  with the antiquated ransom theory in apparent blissful ignorance of the  17 None of this means that Rashi was unaware of the fact that the plain meaning of the  word hokhmah is wisdom and that it sometimes signifies nothing more than that. Thus,  he is unprepared to rely on an overarching introductory observation and instead points  out to his readers on repeated occasions that their untutored instincts embracing this  understanding are incorrect. — 163 — </page> <page sequence="13"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response satisfaction theory in Cur Deus Homo?18 Moreover, when Jews in Spain  and Provence did confront arguments from ratio, they usually took the  offensive, maintaining that it was precisely Christian dogmas that were  unreasonable; it is not clear why a Jew who was the product of an often  assertive Ashkenazic culture would choose to react to the challenge not  by utilizing the category but by fleeing from it. This Ashkenazic assertiveness and self-confidence— akin to the  self-image noted in the title of Haym Soloveitchik’s study of the laws  governing the taking of interest19—may well play a role in the larger  phenomenon that we are examining. Limited exposure, perhaps even  substantial exposure, to books representing alternative ways of thinking  would not easily transform the psychic world of people confident about  their mode of understanding God and the world. Indeed, it is by no  means clear why we should take for granted that they should have  adopted the new approach. Are the workings of the Active Intellect really  so intrinsically plausible that anyone who hears about them should nod  in automatic assent? Setting this last point aside, I suspect that the  self-confidence that characterized Ashkenazic Jewry played a role in its  resistance to the absorption of non-Ashkenazic works and influences  in the realm of Torah as well. The Jews of Southern France were more  receptive—perhaps one should say more vulnerable— than Northern  European Jewry to Sephardic rationalism for various reasons. First, their  self-image in the area of halakhic observance studied by Soloveitchik  was less secure, and this may mean something for their overall self- confidence as well. Second, the culture of Provencal Christian society  during the formative period of the region’s Jewry was itself marked by  greater sophistication than that of the North, so that the Jews of the  South may have developed a somewhat more open cultural orientation,  at least in potentia. Most important, with the immigration of Sephardic  Jews into Languedoc in the second half of the twelfth century, Provencal  Jewry was exposed not just to books but to people. Sustained interaction  with human beings is far more powerful than reading alone. You cannot  set aside people the way you can set aside books. 18 The Jewish-Christian Debate, English section, pp. 195-196, and cf. my remarks in  Appendix 2, p. 353. 19 Halakhah, Kalkalah ve-Dimmuy Azmi: ha-Mashkona’ut bi-Yemei ha-Beinayim (Jerusalem,  ca. 1985). — 164 — </page> <page sequence="14"> Polemic, Exegesis, Philosophy, and Science: IV Finally, a word about science that will return us to the subject of hokhmah  in medieval Ashkenazic exegesis. A decade ago, I wrote a piece on the  understanding of Solomon’s wisdom by Jewish exegetes.20 In their  comments on the passage in Kings describing that wisdom, both Rashi and  R. Joseph Kara gave pride of place to Solomon’s command of the sciences  and only then went on to mention a “midrash aggadah” that understands  the king’s discourses on trees, birds, and fish as halakhic discussions.  I noted that in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, traditionalist commentators  routinely identified wisdom with Torah, but in this instance there were  powerful textual reasons to marginalize this understanding. Let me add  here that if Rashi really had a driving ideological motive for avoiding  an understanding of wisdom as human understanding, he should have  avoided it in Kings as well as in Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes despite the  fact that the local context of the passage about Solomon militated against  the identification of wisdom with Torah. Indeed, the very fact that Rashi  does regard the identification of Solomonic wisdom with mastery of  halakhah as a viable possibility makes his primary interpretation all the  more difficult to explain if he had an overriding concern with preventing  his readers from understanding hokhmah as human wisdom. But my primary reason for citing this article is the following argument  for distinguishing the attitude of Ashkenazic Jews toward science from  their attitude toward philosophy: We should not wonder about the positive assessment of practical scientific  knowledge expressed in [the] commentaries of the [Northern] French  exegetes. As I have argued elsewhere,21 the pursuit of natural science could  become the subject of controversy precisely in the Sephardic orbit, where  it was caught up in the web of philosophy. If the natural sciences were part  of the “propaedeutic studies” leading to the queen of the sciences, they  could be tainted by the unsavory reputation of the queen herself. Where  they stood on their own, it is hard to imagine any grounds of principle  for dismissing them or for failure to admire one who had mastered their  20 “’The Wisest of All Men’: Solomon’s Wisdom in Medieval Jewish Commentaries on the  Book of Kings.” In Hazon Nahum: Studies in Jewish Law, Thought and History presented  to Dr. Norman Lamm on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday, ed. by Yaakov Elman and  Jeffrey S.

The very indifference of Ashkenazic Jews to philosophical study  liberated them to examine the natural world with keen, unselfconscious  interest.22 In sum, I see no reason in principle for Ashkenazic Jews to have  resisted an interest in science. But the rationalist spirit of Sephardic  philosophy, with its questioning of the plain meaning of biblical texts and  rabbinic aggadah, its valuing of philosophical inquiry as an enterprise at  least on a par with traditional study of Torah, its suspicion of miracles,  and its pursuit of the works of non-Jewish thinkers, was decidedly alien  to the most deeply embedded instincts of Ashkenazic Jews. When we  find an approach in an Ashkenazic work or series of works that accords  with the traditionalist instincts of that culture, we need not look any  further in an attempt to explain it. 22 “The Wisest of All Men,” p. 95. — 166 — </page> </plain_text>
