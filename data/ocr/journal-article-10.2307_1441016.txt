Hutchinson Tropical Monographs, London, 1964, 174 pp. 21 shillings.-This companion volume to the same author's monograph "The anatomy of the rainbow lizard Agama agama (L.)" deals with many aspects of the lizard's behavior: daily pattern of activity, thermal relations, food, reproduction, development, social be- havior, and populations. Much of the book is devoted to social be- havior-the changes in coloration during social contacts, the postures and movements as males and females encounter members of their own and the opposite sex. As most of the observations were of free lizards and were carried out over several years, the work reported here is not only impressive but probably is a truer picture of this lizard's behavior than could be obtained from caged animals. Two sections impressed me especially. Harris' analysis of the diet deals with taxo- nomic composition, size of prey, changes re- lated to the lizard's size, and the energetics (in a crude way) of food collecting. This is one of the most thorough analyses of saurian food habits I know. It represents a lot of work and, more importantly, thoughtful work. The other impressive part relates thermal requirements, reproduction, and the weather in the 3 quite different climatic zones of Nigeria. Apparently in the southern rain forest belt, breeding activity of Agama agama is drastically reduced for several months be- cause the persistent cloud cover prevents the lizards from basking and raising their body temperatures to necessary levels. In the northern savannah country, insolation is ade- quate but the soil is too dry for development of eggs during the dry season. The general impression one gains from "The life of the rainbow lizard" is that Harris really knows this species. The work ranks with the best of its counterparts from Europe and North America. It is gratifying to have a study of this sort, rather than alpha taxonomy, come from a resident tropical biologist.-ROBERT F. INGER, Chicago Natural History Museum, Chicago, Illinois. NATURAL HISTORY OF SNAKES. By H. W. Parker. British Museum (Natural History), London. 1965. v + 95 pp., 18 figs., pls. Price 7 shillings/6 pence plus 81/2 pence postage.-Like some of the best non- technical booklets issued by museums, this is a succinct survey of one group of animals, rather than a definitive account. Rarely, however, has any group of vertebrates been covered so adequately in a pocket-sized book. Parker admirably summarizes our knowledge of snakes in little more than 100 pages of text, augmented by 18 figs., 6 plates, and an appendix containing 4 extremely useful tables. There is an index, but unfortunately the author fails to provide a bibliography or to cite sources, except for the illustrations, and one statement concerning the fer-de- lance. Properly enough, Parker begins his ac- count with a review of vertebrate origins. This summarizes the significant features of the transitions from fishes to amphibians and from amphibians to the reptiles. The reader is then given a glimpse of the trends in diversification that led to the existing orders before Parker turns to the Squamata, and comparisons of the suborders, snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenids. Though men- tioned infrequently in the text, the am- phisbaenids are treated by Parker as a third suborder, the Annulata, which is compared with the suborders containing snakes and lizards in Table 3 of the appendix. The discussions in the ensuing chapters deal largely with the anatomical peculiarities of snakes and the adaptive significance of their morphological and physiological specializa- tions. Modes of progression are covered piecemeal, but Parker's analysis of "serpen- tine" locomotion is extraordinarily percep- tive. The third chapter, which deals briefly and somewhat inadequately with the senses of snakes, tends to neglect sensory mecha- nisms. Some of these, however, are described in sections more directly concerned with other topics. In the next four chapters Parker covers a wide array of topics, ranging from the impact of the physical environment to protective devices, male combat, various aspects of reproduction, growth, and nutri- tion, along with ecdysis, metachrosis, the 531</page><page sequence="2">COPEIA, 1965, NO. 4 venom apparatus, and modes of killing or subduing prey. The remaining chapters, nearly half the book, are largely devoted to the structural and behavioral peculiarities of the snakes in the 13 families and 14 subfamilies recog- nized. Although Parker discusses many other attributes, he focuses attention on the char- acteristics of snakes that afford a means of arranging them in groups. In essence, Parker has devised a classification, one that improves upon and brings up to date the arrangement that Malcolm Smith adopted in 1943 (Volume 3 of the Fauna of British India). Following the proposals of other investigators, Parker adds the Anomalepidae and Bolyeridae. He removes the extremely aberrant wart snakes from the Colubridae, where both Boulenger and Smith had egregiously assigned them subfamily status. Concurring with Hoffstetter, Parker places them in a separate family, the Acrochordi- dae, after the boas. The egg-eating snakes are retained in a separate subfamily, but placed with the colubrids. Parenthetically, it may be noted that Malcolm Smith evi- dently considered doing this, even though he used the name Dasypeltidae in his keys to families as well as in his discussion of the group. Inadvertently, perhaps, he neverthe- less left the name Dasypeltinae in his key to the subfamilies of the Colubridae, which suggests that he had intended to leave it where Parker now puts it. Smith did not bother to divide the Anilidae into subfamilies, but Parker recog- nizes the Cylindrophinae for the Asiatic pipe snakes and puts the South American genus in the nominate subfamily. He is evidently unimpressed with the idea that Loxocemus has affinities with Anilius, but he retains the subfamily Loxoceminae, and places it in the Boidae along with the Boinae, Pythoninae, and Tropidophinae. Partition- ing of the Colubridae poses many more problems, and Parker prefaces his discussion of the family with the comment that "no completely satisfactory scheme of subfamily divisions has yet been devised." He observes that "it is convenient to recognize a few small groups of aberrant or specialized forms," and these are, of course, virtually the only groups even moderately well de- fined. Parker might have added, however, that partitioning the Colubridae in this fashion leads to a rather fatuous situation. After a few genera have been allocated to five more or less definable subfamilies, a vast array of snakes, including highly adapted burrowers and arboreal species, are left (rather than placed) in the Colubrinae with a good many unspecialized terrestrial forms. Owing to the adaptive modifications in their progenitors that resulted in the elonga- tion of the body and losses and reductions in structures, the snakes were approaching the irreducible minimum when they emerged. Although they had lost or were losing limbs, ear openings, eyes, and other structures, snakes had not lost their adaptability. They were destined to become diversified by ex- ploiting what they had. Whatever limita- tions this imposed, snakes rapidly became adapted in whatever ways they could to whatever habitats were open to them. If adaptability accounts for wide dispersal and diversification, however, it also accounts for convergence. Because snakes tend to become adapted in similar ways to similar habitats, morpho- logical modifications of the snakes in one region occasionally parallel those of distant relatives in comparable environments in other parts of the world. When the regions are widely separated but ancestries are not, similarities attributable to convergence may be more striking than those indicative of phylogenetic divergence. In some instances, the nature of the adaptation remains ob- scure. A few colubrids in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, for example, possess oddly modified vertebrae with winglike expan- sions of the zygapophyses. Though unaware of those in Africa, Parker suggests that snakes of two genera in Asia and one in Central America be recognized as a sub- family, Nothopsinae. While Parker's book was in press, however, it became evident (at least to the reviewer) that the affinities of snakes with specialized vertebrae were closer to those of genera with unspecialized vertebrae inhabiting the same regions (Bogert 1964, Senck. biol. 45:509-542). Aside from the superficial resemblances of their vertebrae, they bore little resemblance to colubrids in other continents. If the subfamily Nothopsinae warrants retention, therefore, it is improbable that it contains Asiatic genera. Malcolm Smith ap- plied the name Xenoderminae to five monotypic genera, including Nothopsis in Central America and four others in Asia, two of which possessed vertebrae with modi- 532</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND COMMENTS fications paralleling those of Nothopsis. Smith erroneously credited the name Xeno- derminae to Cope, who actually proposed the name Nothopsinae that Parker employs. If the four Asiatic genera that Smith placed in the subfamily comprise a natural group that can be diagnosed, the deletion of Nothopsis will require that Xenoderminae be used but credited to Smith. Few authors have sought to partition the Elapidae, and neither does Parker. The recognition of subfamilies should undoubt- edly await detailed studies of the genera and species in New Guinea and Australia. Cope, though seldom followed, found it advantageous to separate the five species in one genus as the Dendroaspinae. Actually the genus Dendroaspis is no more readily defined than many other elapid genera, in- cluding Ophiophagus. Improbable as it seems, both genera are more easily diagnosed than Paleonaja, a name proposed by Hoff- stetter and used by Parker for cobras from the Miocene of France. Despite the age of the fossils, they conform so closely in osteo- logical characters to Naja haje that it is questionable whether the Miocene cobra can be diagnosed at the species level. Malcolm Smith in his monograph of the sea snakes advocated recognition of two subfamilies of the Hydrophidae, but in his 1943 volume he scarcely mentions subfami- lies beyond noting that the Hydrophinae and Laticaudinae are "united through Ephalophis." Despite the link, Parker finds the subdivisions worth retaining. Snakes intermediate between the vipers and pit vipers have not been discovered. Conse- quently, most American herpetologists have been inclined to believe that these two groups of venomous snakes are sufficiently well differentiated to be placed in separate families. They nevertheless share so many anatomical and behavioral features that common ancestry can scarcely be questioned. Parker, like Smith before him, prefers to emphasize similarities and group the Crota- linae and Viperinae in the family Viperidae. Whatever criticisms may be leveled at the classification Parker uses, it contains many commendable features. Twenty-one char- acters are employed in a tabular comparison of the families in the appendix, and this alone is worth considerably more than the few shillings charged for the book. Parker rarely makes careless statements, and he is largely successful in avoiding teleological or anthropomorphic phraseology. It is not clear, however, why "few snakes seem able to locate or recognize their prey if it is motionless." Whereas this statement implies that olfaction is of little importance in find- ing prey, farther on in the account Parker says that "so far as is known, all [snakes] rely upon scent to locate each other or for sex recognition." Most arboreal and some terrestrial snakes seem to depend heavily on vision in locating their prey, but not nec- essarily to the exclusion of olfaction. Al- though additional investigation is required before any definitive statement can be made, casual observations strongly suggest that olfaction plays a prominent role, not only in the mating of snakes, but in their food-getting activities as well. Recent advances in our knowledge of snakes make it increasingly difficult to make any generalizations concerning this group of reptiles. Discussions, particularly in books addressed to the student or the public, can bog down in detail if the author attempts to mention all possible exceptions to every generalization he finds it expedient to make. Parker deserves credit for conveying so much information in so little space. In view of this, perhaps Parker will be pardoned for omitting a bibliography.-C. M.
