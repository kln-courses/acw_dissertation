ISBN: 0-393-02403-2. 1987. We scientists are poor at explaining ourselves. Herein lies the necessity of elegant stories told in appealing style about our work and its products. Alas, Sargent is not Gould, Roueche, or De Kruif. As I came across teleology, anthropomorphism, and bursts of sensationalism in the book, I reminded myself of its intended audience. After all, who among us has not used teleology as shorthand for explaining some adaptation? But Sargent's mislead- ing scenarios, amounting to just-so stories, suffer as well from the multiple solecisms of factual error/ misinterpretation, poor organization, and flawed language. Equally insidious in the subgenre of science popularization currently in vogue is the prostitution of fact in the interest of making moral points, in this case environmentalism. Indeed, The Year of the Crab stands as a type specimen of the pit- falls in popularizing science. Trifling and not-so-trifling errors of fact abound. E. pluribus are these three: Fireflies flash syn- chronously in Malaysia (not Melanesia) (p. 102); transmission of kuru, a slow viral disease of only the South Fore, has been related to endocannibalism (p. 143); each Lion's Mane jellyfish is an individual medusa, not a colony (p. 86). Chapter 22, a rambling account of physiological adaptations in diving vertebrates, typifies the book's lack of focus and logic. It begins and ends, reason- ably enough, with a natural history of seals. Con- sideration of diving bradycardia centers on birds. After its discovery in ducks, "modern researchers felt they should study the response in unrestrained animals. One way of doing this was to raise diving animals as pets" (p. 154). This non sequitur is fol- lowed by an anecdote of pet cormorants disrupting a cocktail party. Whether or how the errant birds furthered knowledge of bradycardia is not ad- dressed. Sargent's less than deft use of scientific terminol- ogy and concepts can be disconcerting: "The plan- ula descend and metamorphose into an inconspic- uous polyp" (p. 86). Stating "Striped bass were originally related to freshwater species" (p. 91) im- plies that they no longer are. Sargent apparently considers the Ice Age a more recent phenomenon than continental drift (p. 89). The author himself reveals, perhaps unwittingly, what is obvious to knowledgeable readers by stat- ing "I probably spent more time verifying Tallulah Bankhead's quote about Woods Hole than any other fact in this book" (p. 168). Is it any wonder that so many scientists feel that our best interests are not well served by popular science writing?
