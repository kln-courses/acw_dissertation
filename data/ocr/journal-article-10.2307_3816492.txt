<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton Lost and Regained By FRENCH FOGLE* TTis one of the ironies of literary history that posterity's judgments on particular poets so seldom show any true regard for the poet's desires or expectations in the way of reputation. One can well be- lieve that Shakespeare, that great Indifferent to Fame, would react with something approaching bemused incredulity to his position of unquestioned primacy in the hierarchy of English poets, and would certainly be astonished at the flood of volumes dealing with the small- est details of his life and writing. Other writers-Chaucer, Cleveland, Cowper, Donne-might respond with various degrees of surprise, indignation, pleasure, and disbelief if they could see themselves as their critics have seen them. But it would take a hardy soul indeed to suggest the reverberations of Milton's discovery that his fit audience though few was beginning to resemble in some respects the rout that made the hideous roar. We shall not, therefore, spend our time in such speculation, but turn rather to a consideration of the cloud of witnesses who have felt called upon to speak out on Milton, those responsible for swelling the ranks of the few into the many, with what we hope is no loss of fitness. A short paper, such as this, will drastically limit our consideration of the broad field of Milton scholarship and criticism. We shall speak only in the most general termns of the critical attitudes before i 900, summarize a bit more closely the main developments in the first thirty-five years or so of the twentieth century, and deal most spe- cifically with work that has appeared in the last ten to fifteen years, work that may be considered to have re-established Milton, for the modern reader, in the company of respectable English poets. Let us at the beginning face openly the implications of such a study as this. It is a criticism of criticism, and sometimes a criticism of criticism of still other criticism. At its worst it may be the Serbonian bog of schol- arly effort, or, to change the metaphor, it may simply be the merry- *This paper was read at a seminar at the Huntington Library, November 17, 195I.

The danger must be clearly seen and as carefully avoided. But it can be a healthy exercise to try to see ourselves objectively as crit- ics, in the hope of correcting or equalizing those traits in us that mark us as peculiar products of a particular pont in history. It may be true, as E. E. Stoll says, that each age re-creates a literary master- piece in its own image-or translates it into its own terms.' But for the critic to give himself solely to that activity limits both the mas- terpiece and the critic. Professor A. S. P. Woodhouse also may be right in stating that the business of the critic of poetry is "with the understanding and appreciation of individual poems and of a poet's total output as expressive of his mind',2 but I would add that it is also his business to come to his study with a deep awareness of himself and of his times. He must make the effort to transcend the particu- larity of his own age in order to see more clearly the masterpiece, himself, and his relationship to that masterpiece.. His value as a critic will depend directly on his success in overcoming the presupposi- tions and prejudices and intellectual barriers of his own time. As Coleridge says, "The man who reads a work meant for imnmediate effect on one age with the notions and feelings of another, may be a refined gentleman, but must be a sorry critic'" And so, in assessing criticism, not only of Milton but of any other literary figure, our concern should be with both what was said and why it was said. There seems little doubt that Milton's early literary reputation suf- fered from his known political views. Good Tories found the splen- dors of Paradise Lost dimmed considerably by the shadow of the regicide and republican. The fact that his name was used and some of his political writings quoted in the hot debates leading up to the Glorious Revolution of I688 did not tend to promote a clear view of his merits as a poet. And yet the fact that Paradise Lost went 'See his "A Postscript to 'Give the Devil His Due"' Philological Quarterly, XXVIII (i949), I67-I84. 2See his "The Approach to Milton;' Tansactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 3rd Series, XXXVIII (I944), 20I-I3. 3Coleridge's Miscellaneous Criticism, ed.

I67.</page><page sequence="3">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 353 through three editions, some 4500 copies, between i667 and I688 has been taken to be a mark of considerable popularity. Dryden was the first major critic to speak in clear and strong approval of Para- dise Lost. He praises the comprehensiveness and loftiness of the theme and the majesty of the style, but has certain reservations about the language. He has no reservation, however, in granting Milton a place in the front rank of great writers of all ages, a rating that has never since that time been seriously disputed. Perhaps Pope's best-known comment on Milton is his remark that God the Father had been made a school divine in Paradise Lost, an observation that may not appear especially penetrating, but one that has been repeated and elaborated on for well over two and a half centuries. Addison's main adverse criticism was directed at the un- naturalness of the language and at some lapses in the handling of the narrative, but even such criticism is almost unheard amid the full chorus of praise for the imaginative splendors, the comprehensive grandeur, and the sublimity of Milton's achievement. An oblique tribute is paid to Milton's authority by the dozens of minor poets of the eighteenth century who tried to adopt his manner and style in handling far less grandiose subjects-and failed disastrously. It has taken Milton something like two centuries to clear himself of blame for the failures of such dubious disciples. The weightiest critic of the eighteenth century, however, of Mil- ton and of others as well, was Samuel Johnson. By temperament and political conviction Milton was anathema to Johnson, and the an- tipathy of the old Tory is everywhere evident, with the exception of his judgments on Paradise Lost. Of the minor poems he finds L'Allegro and II Penseroso pleasant enough, and Comus the best of the minor pieces, although it is dramatically ineffective. The most he will grant to the sonnets is that the best of them (two, I believe) are not really bad. Lycidas, now considered by far the greatest of Mil- ton's minor poems, is so savagely and unequivocally denounced that it is surprising to see both poem and critic survive the performance with any prestige whatsoever. "One of the poems"' he says, "on which much praise has been bestowed is Lycidas; of which the dic- tion is harsh, the rhymes uncertain, and the numbers unpleasing. What beauty there is we must therefore seek in the sentiments and</page><page sequence="4">354 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY images:'4 But whatever concession he appears to make here he pro- ceeds to deny with great finality. "It is not to be considered as the effusion of real passion; for passion runs not after remote allusions and obscure opimions. Passion plucks no berries from the myrtle and ivy, nor calls upon Arethuse and Mincius, nor tells of 'rough satyrs and fauns with cloven heel;" he growls. "In this poem there is no nature, for there is no truth; there is no art, for there is nothing new. Its form is that of a pastoral, easy, vulgar, and therefore disgustig: whatever images it can supply are long ago exhausted; and its inher- ent improbability always forces dissatisfaction on the mind:' In ex- asperation he asks,"... what imxage of tenderness can be excited by these lines! We drove a field, and both together heard What time the grey fly winds her sultry horn, Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night. We know that they never drove a field, and that they had no flocks to batten; and though it be allowed that the representation may be allegorical, the true meaning is so uncertain and remote that it is never sought because it cannot be known when it is found"'5 And the pitiless attack goes on: "Among the flocks and copses and flowers appear the heathen deities, Jove and Phoebus, Neptune and Aeolus, with a long train of mythologcal imagery, such as a College easily supplies. Nothing can less display knowledge or less exercise inven- tion than to tell how a shepherd has lost his companion and must now feed his flocks alone, without any judge of his skill i pip; and how one god asks another god what is become of Lycidas, and how neither god can tell. He who thus grieves will excite no sym- pathy; he who thus praises will confer no honor:' The grossest defect of all, however, to Johnson is the poem's impiety, its polluting of sacred truths with profane fictions, but he allows some slight excuse for the poet by suggesting that Milton was unconscious of what he was doing. The final comment is an expression of incredulity: "Sure- ly no man could have fancied that he read Lycidas with pleasure had he not known its author:' 4Lives of the English Poets, ed. George Birkbeck HiU (Oxford, i9o5), I, I63 ff. 5Imagine Johnson's exasperation with modern scholars who are not in the least deterred by such considerations. Witness the persistent attempts to clarify the meaning of the "two-handed engine'</page><page sequence="5">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 355 Johnson may have been blind to the beauties of pastoral poetry, but his vision is crystal clear when he comes to view the epic. His enthusiasm amounts almost to abandon when he pronounces Para- dise Lost "a poem which, considered with respect to design, may claim the first place, and with respect to performance the second, among the productions of the human mind." He emphasizes the right- ness of the moral ("to show the reasonableness of religion, and the necessity of obedience to the Divine Law"); the fable, in which Milton equaled every other poet; and the scope, which is of the very highest greatness. The majesty of the characters, the integrity and completeness of the design, and the justness of the sentiments are all singled out for particular praise. He echoes Addison in citing sub- limity as the characteristic quality of the poem. The limitations he sees are few and not especially damaging: it does not deal with hu- man action in terms we can understand, since most of the action occurs before the Fall; it tries to describe what cannot be described ("the agency of spirits"), with the consequence that the material and the immaterial are not held in proper relationships; the allegory of Sin and Death is an unnecessary intrusion; and there are minor flaws in the narrative. Milton's language, which is held to be per- fectly appropriate for Paradise Lost, is criticized in general by John- son because Milton used the same kind for all purposes. It is too learned and pedantic, too foreign in idiom. One of the few instances of indecisiveness in Johnson comes on the point of the verse. He holds that, by and large, absence of rhyme is a defect in English verse, but he does not wish for Milton to have been a rhymer, for he could not wish Paradise Lost other than it is. And his final judgment is that the epic is "not the greatest of heroic poems, only because it is not the first:' Paradise Regained wins his praise because, although it lacks the loftiness and grandeur of Paradise Lost, it is "in many parts elegant, and every-where instructive:" It has been too much depreciated, he feels, whereas Samson Agonistes has received altogether too much admiration. Johnson could not understand how Milton would choose Greek drama for a model, with its cumbersome chorus, when he had much finer examples of dramatic form in the French and English theater of his day.</page><page sequence="6">356 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY No apology is needed, I suppose, for dwelling at such length on Johnson's criticism. It is undoubtedly the springboard from which most modern criticism takes off, for the critical issues which he singles out for discussion are still the ones that any substantial critic must cope with before going on to other considerations. This is not to say that agreement with Johnson is required. Far from it. The dis- senters have been many and sometimes violent. Rut he does, with his almost unerring sense of the important and his disregard of the un- important, mark clearly the lines for future battles. Few readers of Paradise Lost have failed to feel the power and excitement of the character of Satan, but it was left to Williamn Blake to identify Milton with the Devil's party. In trying to explain the difference between the dramatic effectiveness of the fallen angels and the flabbiness of those who stood, he insisted that Milton himself was one of the fallen spirits without knowing it. To him, Satan was without question the hero of the epic, the character who drew most forcibly on our attention and sympathies. Almost all of the Romantic critics concurred on the question of Satan's power. According to Hazlitt, Wordsworth once said "that he could read the description of Satan in Milton, till he felt a certain faintness come over his mind from a sense of beauty and grandeur. . . '. Hazlitt himself declared that "Satan is the most heroic subject that was ever chosen for a poem; and the execution is as perfect as the design is lofty"7 Cole- ridge felt the spell strongly, for he says of Satan, "around this char- acter he [Milton] has thrown a singularity of daring, a grandeur of sufferance, and a ruined splendour, which constitute the very height of poetic sublimity'8 All of these men, however, would have reser- vations about making Satan the outright hero of the poem. Not so P. B. Shelley. He says, "Nothing can exceed the energy and magnifi- cence of the character of Satan as expressed in 'Paradise Lost'. " But it is not just in the power of the character portrayal that his suprem- acy rests; it resides in the very virtue of the character itself.

Milton has so far violated the popular creed (if this shall be judged to be a violation) as to have alleged no superiority of moral virtue to his God over his Devil. And this bold neglect of a direct moral purpose is the most decisive proof of the supremacy of Milton's genius'"9 Now, most of these ideas are non- sense, but the enchanting power of Satan over Milton readers has never been completely broken. As recently as I945 a furious battle was still raging between C. S. Lewis and Charles Williams on the one hand and E. E. Stoll on the other as to the merits, not only dramatic but also moral, of that dazzling figure. There are no serious critics today, I believe, who insist that Satan is the true hero (whatever that may mean) of the epic, but neither are there any who deny his power, and there are some who still insist that Satan is largely Milton, and vice versa. But the main point for us to remember here is that the vast and compelling appeal of Satan was representative of the kind of thing that was most admirable to the Romantics in Milton's art. They all join Addison and Johnson in marking sublimity as the pre-eminent characteristic of the poem. Milton has "beauty in [the highest] degree; pathos in a degree next to the highest; perfect char- acter in the conception of Satan, of Adam and Eve; fancy, learning, vividness of description, stateliness, decorum. . . '1o These are the qualities that strike Hazlitt-and many other critics as well. Coleridge singles out the musical qualities of the poet, his "opulence of descrip- tive details" his "exhaustless imagination' and "the grandeur and purity of Milton's soulE1" It will be noted that all of these observations-and they are fairly representative of early nineteenth-century Milton criticism-are di- rected toward Milton the poet, not Milton the man.

But this personal history was largely forgotten in the critics' absorption with the imaginative life of the poet. Even David Masson's monumental biography, which began to appear in 1859, with its staggering accumulation of histori- cal information about Milton's life and times, did little to change this emphasis in nineteenth-century criticism, for the spell of Milton the poet was strong over his biographer. As for the intellectual side of the man, there was little that needed to be said. Early in the century his theological views were accepted as being on the whole solidly orthodox; the exciting accomplishment was the translation of that orthodoxy into great poetry. His political and social beliefs were little regarded. In the latter part of the century when the skeptical spirit, the spirit of higher criticism had begun to undermine the cer- tainty of Victorian faith there was an attitude almost of embarrass- ment about Milton's doctrine, as if the less said about the theological framework of Paradise Lost the better. One could no longer believe in the mythology of Milton. There remained, however, the glories of the poetry-its organ music, the tremendous daring of the vision, the emotional intensity of its statement. Critics toward the end of the century were more sober in their judgments on Milton than the Romantics had been, but they were forced to stress the same qualities. Mark Pattison, writing in I879, points to the richness of language, the loftiness of strain, the ma- jestic demeanor, the wealth of allusion, but he is distressed at the lack of any real intellectual substance in the poem."2 "But if' he says, "as a treasury of poetic speech, Paradise Lost has gained by time, it has lost far more as a storehouse of divine truth. We at this day are better able than ever to appreciate its force of expression, its grace of phrase, its harmony of rhythmical movement, but it is losing its hold over our imagination. Strange to say, this failure of vital power in the con- stitution of the poem is due to the very selection of subject by which Milton sought to secure perpetuity' He goes on to point out that nineteenth-century loss of faith in the story of Paradise Lost, in the l2Mark Pattison, Milton (London, I879), pp. 199-200.</page><page sequence="9">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 359 demonology, angelology, and anthropomorphic theology of the poem, seriously interfered with its effectiveness poetically. And he looks to the future with considerable misgiving. "Were the sapping process to continue at the same rate for two more centuries, the pos- sibility of epic illusion would be lost to the whole scheme and econ- omy of the poem." Pattison does glance at the personal qualities of Milton when he notes as limitations the unsympathetic disposition of the man and a deficiency of the human element in his imagination, but these limitations are mentioned only for their significance for the poetry. He shows little interest in seeing Milton apart from his art. Sir Walter Raleigh's Milton, coming at the very end of the cen- tury (I900), stands as a very convenient summation of the critical attitudes of the nineteenth century.'3 He is appreciative of the poetic powers of his subject-"that unrelenting intensity, that lucidity, as clear as air and as hard as agate; that passion which burns with a con- suming heat or with a blinding light in all his writings" but these qualities "have endeared him to none' He admires the "preternatu- rally majestic diction" and the airy grace of the structure, and he yields to the powerful appeal of Satan. "The epic value of Paradise Lost' he says, "is centered in the character and achievements of Satan" But this is no longer enough for Raleigh, as it was for earlier critics. He is deeply disturbed by the lack of substance and intel- lectual respectability in Milton. On the prose he is generally apolo- getic and embarrassed. He has the amazing statement that only one issue out of all the prose is still alive-that of freedom of the press. He credits Milton's style with vigor and strength but with little else, and the ideas are dismissed either as arising from purely personal and selfish concerns on Milton's part or as the hopelessly logical conclu- sions of that most pathetic of all spectacles-the poet dabbling in politics. The characters and myth of Paradise Lost are no longer acceptable to the modern reader, and as a consequence the epic has lost much of its original "universality:' Milton, he says, "projected himself, like a sleepwalker, into the mammoth caves of his antedi- luvian dreams, and lived among his own radiant and shadowy cre- ations:' To Raleigh, at least, the glory of the Miltonic achievement was so remote, so alien that it had lost its vital importance for the lSAWalter Raleigh, Milton (London, 1900), pp. 7-8, 124, 133, 263.</page><page sequence="10">360 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY modern reader. And there is something funereal in the tone of his final comment-"that as he stands far aloof from his contemporaries, so in the succession of great that mark for us the centuries of our literature he is seen once more singular and a stranger.' It would seem that Milton was lost. The shade of Milton, however, was not to rest in peace for very long. Just seventeen years after Raleigh's study appeared, a new and glorified Milton began to rise on a scaffold of articles. Two of the leading spirits in this revival of Milton from the ashes of older critical estimates were Edwin Greenlaw and James Holly Hanford. In the same issue of Studies in Philology (April, 1917) each man had an article in which he announced a clear break with the critical tradi- tions of the past. Greenlaw lashes out at criticism which had attacked Milton "for inconsistency, for representing an outworn theology, and for triviality:'4 Both Spenser and Milton, he says, "have been praised chiefly for certain 'poetic' qualities at the expense of intel- lectual power, a judgment which they would have resented.' Earlier criticism, he continues, has maintained that Milton's epic "is a gi- gantic bathos, moving from a cosmic stage filled with titanic figures down to an insignificant spot on earth, where two 'harmless tame creatures' (Professor Raleigh's phrase) are damned for eating an apple"' And he concludes curtly, "Such criticism as applied to Milton ... is of Satanic origin. . . Hanford, writing on the dramatic element in Paradise Lost, sounds the same cry. "The criticism which makes him a mere poetic voice, speaking gloriously of irrational or petty thing[s], is as outworn as the Calvinistic system by which his outlook is supposed to have been so strictly bound. The view of life in Paradise Lost is one which far transcends the limits of the Puritan theology while it includes its ideal faith'"'5 His insistence is on the fact that Milton's continued power and appeal result from his having "drunk deep at the foun- tains of the Renaissance' and from his reflecting a living tradition, the tradition of Renaissance humanism. This side of Milton has been forgotten. But, he writes prophetically two years later, "we are about 14Edwin Greenlaw, "A Better Teacher than Aquinas' Studies in Philology, XIV (19I7), I96-217. '5James Holly Hanford, "The Dramatic Element in Paradise Lost' ibid., 178-95.</page><page sequence="11">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 36I to write a new chapter in Milton criticism.""6 This newer study of Milton proposes, according to Hanford, "a reinterpretation and a revaluation of the poem in terms neither of sentimentalism nor of romanticism nor of Victorian idealism but of humanism, and it seeks as a first step toward such revaluation to see Milton's philosophy as a whole by exploring his prose as well as his poetry, to set him in his right relation, not to Puritanism alone, but to the entire Renaissance, and so to realize, through a richer understanding, the significance of his work as poetic criticism of life" The enthusiasm of the newer critics for writing the new chapter was kindled by their profound conviction that "Milton is no mere poetic voice speaking irration- alities, nor yet simply a transcendent imagination, but a poet of humanity, and Paradise Lost is primarily the epic of man's moral struggle, the record of his first defeat and the promise of his ultimate victory" And this, to me, sounds very much as if Milton had been regained. The methods of the new approach to Milton were brilliantly illus- trated in 1920 when Greenlaw published his article on Spenser's in- fluence on Paradise Lost.17 He points to some close parallels between Spenser and Milton on fundamental problems of philosophy and science, and he pleads the case for direct influence. But perhaps his more valuable service lies in his showing so clearly that these funda- mental problems-of the plan of the cosmos, man's position in the scheme of Nature, the origins of the earth, the nature of the Fall, the means of individual salvation-were vital elements in the whole in- tellectual ferment of the Renaissance. He does not attempt to dismiss or explain away the Puritan elements in Milton's thought, but he does succeed in placing Milton in the central current of Renaissance humanism. The achievement of opening the floodgates of the Renaissance was not, of course, the work of two men. The 1920's saw a host of tireless and excited scholars in a quest for sources, parallels, and in- fluences. The left wing of this group concerned themselves with '6James Holly Hanford, "Milton and the Return to Humanism" ibid., XVI (I9I9), 126-47. l7Edwin Greenlaw, "Spenser's Influence on Paradise Lost,' ibid., XVII (1920), 320-59.</page><page sequence="12">362 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY finding arresting resemblances between certain aspects of Milton's thought and some little-known and less-suspected works of the pe- riod. The most striking product of this school was Denis Saurat's Milton: Man and Thinker (1925) with its dark hints that Milton drew on the Kabbalah for many of his philosophic concepts, but others were finding that the poet had been influenced by Servetus, the heretic, and by his Semitic studies and rabbinical readings. In the meantime, the intellectual background of the seventeenth cen- tury was being explored for its importance to an understanding of Milton. Marjorie Hope Nicolson's articles on Milton, Hobbes, and More'8 point to Milton's awareness of some of the lively philosophi- cal debates of the time; A. H. Gilbert and E. N. S. Thompson ex- plore Milton's use and knowledge of astronomy and geography;'9 and R. D. Havens examines the Influence of Milton on English Poetry (I922). Other studies of the decade include an examination of Milton's theory of poetry, a comparative study of Milton and Lactantius, and the influence of the Bible on Milton's prose. Han- ford's work was continued with his very important "Chronology of Milton's Private Studies"20 and four years later with "The Youth of Milton'.21 J. S. Smart's fine edition of the sonnets appeared in 192 I. E. M. W. Tillyard's Milton (1930), coming as it does at the very end of the decade, is an interesting effort at revaluating Milton in the light of the new scholarship. He had not been satisfied, he says, with some of the answers to the question of what Paradise Lost was chiefly about, and he sets out to study the problem anew. The question, as 22 A. J. A. Waldock points out, is one that the twentieth century was asking with a new intention. Greenlaw had first brought up the mat- ter of the "real theme" of Paradise Lost, implying that Milton's ex- plicitly stated theme in the prologue to Book I was either too simple 18"The Spirit World of Milton and More" Studies in Philology, XXII ('925), 433-52; "Milton and Hobbes" ibid., XXIII (i926), 405-33.

Tillyard proceeds from the question to a thorough exami- nation of the development of Milton's mind and character through the early years and on to the time of the major poems. The matter gets so complex that he has to divide his findings into Conscious Meanings and Unconscious Meanings in order to make clear the im- pressions the poem left with him. Some of his analyses are illuminat- ing and stimulating, some are highly questionable because they are so personal. The impression of Milton's pessimism, for instance, which to him is so unmistakable, is hardly shared by all readers of Paradise Lost. His basic assumption that "what the poem is really about" can in some way be equated with "the true state of Milton's mind when he wrote it" has been attacked keenly and almost violent- ly by C. S. Lewis and A. J. A. Waldock. The record of the exchange of views between Tillyard and Lewis is found in The Personal Heresy, published in 1939. There is much skilfull debating of such questions as: Whether the prime end of the study of poetry should be a knowledge of the poet's personality. What is poetry? What is poetry about? What is personality? And what is the value of poetry and the poet to a reader? But as one would expect, there are few con- clusions agreed on and basic positions are not changed much by the discussion. The chief value of the debate lies in the clarity and vigor with which two widely-different approaches to the study of poetry are presented. The effect is to make the critical examination of po- etry a lively and exciting pursuit rather than an academic exercise. Lewis feels that whatever weaknesses Tillyard exhibits in his Milton study can be traced to his fundamental conviction that "the mean- ing of a poem is not the story told, the statements made, the philoso- phy stated, but the state of mind, valuable or otherwise, revealed by the sum of all the elements of the poem. ' 23 This, to me, is some- what like saying that a poem doesn't mean what the poet says it means, but that it means what it means. And a lot of very puzzling and pointless criticism can come from such a stand. Professor Till- yard, however, is a very intelligent and sensitive critic and can never be accused of lacking point. In the hands of less well-informed and 23Tillyard, op. cit., p. 239.</page><page sequence="14">364 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY controlled critics the principle might be m'isleading rather than helpful. In the full chorus of critics who claimed Milton for the Renais- sance, there was at least one dissenting voice. E. E. Stoll in a chapter of his Poets and Playwrights (1930), warned of certain fallacies of modern criticism. The historical fallacy is that which assumes influ- ence too easily and tends to make a given author conform in every point to his own age. This point of view limits the scope of the poet's individuality and makes him too narrowly dependent on his imme- diate predecessors. The anachronistic fallacy, on the other hand, would make an author not what he was but what today would make of him by its "new" psychology, its "new" philosophy, and its "new" humanism. The result is a distortion of the original. This, he felt, was what was happening to Milton. In another essay in the same vol- ume on "Milton, Puritan of the Seventeenth Century' he protests against those critics who make him predominantly a humanist, a product of the Renaissance and the ancient culture. This does vio- lence to Milton, for, he says, "The tone and manner of Milton are individual and unmistakable, and are, as I perceive them, in the main those of a Puritan hero, a great poetical prophet.... The tone of a humanist, as I imagine it, is widely different.... A humanist is toler- ant and genial, all-embracing and all-enjoying. A humanist has hu- mor, takes his liberty and is not greatly troubled about consistency, and sets the spirit and the flesh, Christianity and paganism pretty much on a level. A humanist is all things to all men and their opinions, and his thoughts and feelings are not perfectly harmonized or rigor- ously ordered. A Puritan's are, and to that end part of human expe- rience is excluded from their scope. They are centered, like Milton's, in the moral and religious sentiment" One can almost see the histori- cal critics leaping to the destruction of such descriptions of Puritan and humanist. Even Stoll does not seem to be too secure here, for he admits later on that "between us and the critics it is also a question of proportion and emphasis.

In the 193 0'S Milton criticism and scholarship, by its very bulk and variety, becomes much less manageable. There are certain develop- ments, however, which should be noted particularly-not, by the way, necessarily in the order of their importance. One area of fruitful disturbance was that of the New Criticism in its relation to the poetry of Milton. Even in the twenties Pound, Eliot, and other critics had expressed great dissatisfaction with some of the qualities of Milton's verse. The center of the discontent was what Eliot called a "dissociation of sensibility" which set in in the seventeenth century, largely through the influence of Milton and Dryden. The result was that language became not the inevitable medium for the expression of the poet's fusion of thought and feel- ing, as it properly should, but rather something to be cultivated for itself. In a note on the verse of John Milton in Essays and Studies, 1936, Eliot charges Milton with the responsibility for this deteriora- tion of the language and for the bad influence it exerted on poets of the eighteenth century and even later. He stresses the aural element in his poetry at the expense of visual imagination. He does not en- large the meanings of his words. His language is static, artificial, and conventional. Milton writes English like a dead language, he says, echoing one of Raleigh's charges. The weightiness and justice of Eliot's judgments were felt by other poets and critics of those years, and strenuous efforts were devoted to ignoring Milton. By I936 one of the young critics looks up quite casually and notes with only the mildest surprise that "Milton's dislodgment, in the past decade, after his two centuries of predominance, was effected with remarkably little fuss'2' But the dread voice was not past, and just ten years later Eliot was granting to young poets access to "the greatest master in our language of freedom within form' "In short" he says, "it now seems to me that poets are sufficiently removed from Milton, and suf- ficiently liberated from his reputation, to approach the study of his work without danger, and with profit to their poetry and to the 25F.

Not more somber, certainly, but perhaps more significant work was being done in other areas. The enthusiasm of the 1920'S for Milton's humanism, for his daring and independent thought, and for his radical tendencies in politics began to be tempered somewhat by studies in the general religious and political background of the Puritan revolution. Haller's Tracts on Liberty (I934) and his Rise of Puritani'sm (1938) show how widespread were many of the ideas fonnerly considered Milton property, and inlcidentally, how small a public part Milton played in the radical movements of the I640's. Many scholars-Barker, Woodhouse, Whiting, and Hughes, among others-in investigating the background of Milton's prose and the religious and political situations that called it forth demon- strated clearly Milton's alliance with the Puritan party, but they also threw new light on the nature of the Puritanism of the period, a light which tended to remove some of the onus from the very term "Puritan:' These studies established Milton all the more firmly in the life of his own time, a period brought closer to us by their analyzing the confused conflicts of the period into more mean- ingful patterns. Debates over Milton's theology and over the relationship between the doctrines of Paradise Lost and those in De Doctrina Christiana were vigorous and constructive. There were many voices, the most prominent being those of Arthur Sewell, H. J. G. Grierson, and Maurice Kelley. In his Study of Milton's Christian Doctrine ( I 939) Sewell argues that differences of idea and tone in the De Doctrina and the later poems indicate something of a spiritual conflict in Milton, the treatise representing his intellectual statement of belief and the poetry the response of the whole man to religious issues. The poetry, therefore, portrays a belief which is at points widely different from that of the prose, and Sewell attempts to explain why these differences exist. He was met by serious objections to his conclusions. In This Great Argument, Kelley shows to the satis- faction of most critics that Paradise Lost and the De Doctrina belong 26"Milton,' Sewanee ReWew, LVI (I948), p. 20o.</page><page sequence="17">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 367 to the same general period of composition and that they show no significant differences in doctrine. Such differences as do exist between the two, works are only those that might be naturally expected between a systematic theology and a work of poetic art. One of the most significant areas of study during this period had to do with the currency of many of the traditions, ideas, and con- cepts which appear in Milton's poetry. It would be impossible to call the complete roll of the literally hundreds of scholars who reached out into almost every conceivable field to discover that Milton had often been merely following convention when we had thought of him as being original and unique. The worlds of con- temporary science, Biblical lore, literary traditions and conventions, heterodox religious thought-all have been explored and made to yield clues that lead to a more complete understanding of Milton the man and the poet. Out of all this effort has come a bewildering number of learned articles of importance and many fine books. One might mention Grant McColley's Paradise Lost, "The Birth of an Epic"; Arnold Williams' The Common Expositor, for the impor- tance of the hexameral tradition; Douglas Bush's The Renaissance and English Humanism, for its firm settling of Milton in the tradition of Christian humanism; William Riley Parker's Milton's Debt to Greek Tragedy in Samson Agonistes, for the classical strain in Milton's drama; C. S. Lewis's Preface to Paradise Lost, for the light it throws on the way in which a Christian poem should be read; E. M. W. Tillyard's The Miltonic Setting, for its treatment of liter- ary and philosophical background. But even then one would only scratch the surface, for never before in the whole history of Milton criticism has there been such widespread and intense interest in the man and his work. In four main areas of study-the man, the poet, the poetry, the background-work has been done which is both perceptive and exhaustive. Douglas Bush27 explains this interest partly by our increased knowledge of Milton's age and his mind, partly by the stimulation of such individual critical efforts as Lewis's Preface, partly as a result 27"Recent Criticism of Paradise Lost?' Philological Quarterly, XXVIII (1940), 31-43.</page><page sequence="18">368 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY of the modern world's revived interest in religion in an effort to understand more fully something of the nature, motivation, and destiny of man. Whatever the reasons may be for this avalanche of critical and scholarly writing (and there is apparently no end in sight), it seems evident that the quality, by and large, is remarkably high. Otherwise Milton would long ago have been smothered under the sheer weight of it. Quite the reverse has been true. Out of the tensions generated by the various "schools" of criticism have come important works which, taken judiciously, promote a deeper under- standing of Milton-works like Hanford's John Milton, Englishman, Elizabeth M. Pope's Paradise Regained, F. Michael Krouse's Milton's Samson and the Christian Tradition, and stimulating articles on aspects of the poetry by Cleanth Brooks, Arnold Stein, A. S. P. Woodhouse, and many others. The result is that we are now seeing Milton in clearer light as a man of his own time, who, given his heritage of the spiritual and intellectual achievements of the race and his own experience with life, by the power of his creative imagi- nation shaped an answer to some of the most basic problems of human life, an answer which has profound significance for ages not his own. We still need critics like B. Rajan to point out, as he does in Paradise Lost and the Seventeenth Century Reader, the dangers of our present criticism. It is possible that in our zeal to understand Milton we may become so absorbed in studying his age that we forget he is there. Or we may on the other hand think that the main purpose of the knowledge we have painfully built up is simply the fuller under- standing of the poet. His insistence, however, is that the proper approach to any poem is through its effect on the audience. Our evidence, therefore, needs to be arranged not primarily to promote understanding of Milton the man, and not primarily to show just the raw material out of which the poem was formed, but to provide the equipment by which the typical reader can come best prepared to understand what the poem is about. Whatever judgment one may make of the critical principle here implied, the motive is surely worthy-to lead enlightened readers back to the poem. The best of our present criticism is having this effect on modern readers; it is making them take up the poem again. I do not think one can ask more of criticism than that. And as long as we have those critics who</page><page sequence="19">MILTON LOST AND REGAINED 369 can incite us to read and re-read with added delight and understand- ing, there is little danger that Milton will be lost. It would seem then, happily, that Dr. Johnson was wrong. Paradise Lost is NOT one of the books which the reader admires and lays down, and forgets to take up again. We do NOT read Milton for instruction, retire harassed and overburdened, and look elsewhere for recreation. At least modern scholars don't.</page></plain_text>
