<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF EVIL AND A POSSIBLE DIALOGUE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND NEO-CONFUCIANISM By Julia Ching National University of Australia The phenomenon of evil is the more complicated as it is, fund- mentally speaking, a mystery. All the same, every succeeding generation in every cultural tradition is obliged, not only to ex- perience its effects, but also to query the reasons for its presence, hoping thereby better to understand the problem, and to be able to control it for the common good. As a Christian convert from a Chinese society, the writer of this paper impressed by the dominant trend in traditional Chi- nese thought, has long been upholding the basic goodness of human nature, and the contrast presented by Christian missio- nary teaching-pre-Conciliar teaching, at any rate-emphasizing the presence of evil in man.' Without attempting to probe the mystery or explain it away, I hope, in this paper, to present a discussion of evil as a possible Neo-Confucian dialogue with 1. Matthew Ricci taught that human nature is essentially good, but that it can be used to do either good or evil, evil arising especially on account of the presence of concupiscence in man. Cf. T'ien-chu shih-i _ (The True Idea of God), Part 7. Later catechisms, of lesser calibre, said that human nature is essentially evil. The writer of this paper has often heard it taught by missionaries among the Chinese that while Mencius upheld the essential goodness of human nature, Christian teaching says the contrary. - 161 -</page><page sequence="2">Julia Ching Christianity, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.2 Let it first be said that "evil", as discussed here, refers less to ontological imperfections in the universe-"inequality" in things -or even to the evils connected with human suffering, which come in the train of sickness, old age and death, than to the problem of evil in the human heart: moral perversion in its in- dividual or collective manifestations, which bring about so much suffering and havoc, usually to the innocent. What is moral evil? Where does it come from? And, if there is a good God, why does He permit its existence? These are some of the chief questions that have been posed. Evil seems greater and more powerful than man: so often beyond his grasp and control. Its presence has been attributed to a superhuman power, in a dualistic system admitting two primordial principles in standing conflict, or as tension and division in the one God- head.3 While duality of divinity is not allowed in orthodox Christianity, evil is also attributed to the intervention of Satan, a superhuman being, in an originally good world. In monistic Hinduism, on the other hand, evil-as well as good-is con- 2. The writer is aware of important divergences between Protestant and Catho- lic teachings on human nature, especially regarding the depth and extent of the effects of original sin, as well as the nature of "justification" in Christ. The fact, however, that both Protestants and Catholics are undertaking evangelization work among the peoples of the Far East makes it important and useful to suggest points of dialogue with both Protestant and Catholic thinkers, provided that it be understood that the writer is a Catholic. 3. "Dualism" may be variously interpreted. See Eberhard Simons, "Dualism", in Sacramentum Mundi: An Encyclopedia of Theology, edited by Karl Rahner, II, p. 112-p. 115. Gnosticism and Manicheism have generally been con- sidered dualistic. See also J.

It is a common view that Hindu mysticism is "supra-ethical" and removed from distinctions of good and evil. S. Ra- dhakrishnan, however, argues against this. See Eastern Religions and Western Thought (London: Oxford University Press, 1946), p. 102 f. 5. The difficulty with Buddhism is its inner diversity. The various sects of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism manifest many doctrinal divergences, often to an extreme degree. In general, the world of phenomena is regarded as illusory, although certain sects might admit that a kind of "basic reality" is present in it. In What the Buddha Taught (London: G. Fraser, 1967), the author, Walpola Rahula, a monk from Ceylon, purports to give the original teaching of Buddha, which he claims is preserved by the extreme Hinayana sect. 6.

The fact that the Chinese have been preoccupied with the problems of man and of his role in society, does not prevent Chinese humanism from having always been profoundly religious. - 163 -</page><page sequence="4">Julia Ching characteristic Chinese attitude is also reflected in its theory of good and evil. Instead of ascribing evil to a superhuman princi- ple, or of relegating it to a basically unreal phenomenal world, the Chinese theory of evil is inseparable from its theory of human nature. Evil exists; it is either inherent in human nature- which, however, can learn to control it by education-or the product of contact between an originally good nature and its wicked environment. We know these to be the teachings of Hsiin- tzu - (313-138 BC) and of Mencius j -(372-289 BC ?) re- spectively. They began the Great Debate in Chinese philosophy, on a topic where East meets West, since the subject contains metaphysical as well as ethical and psychological implications. Speaking superficially, one might say that while Mencius won the debate in China, Hsiin-tzu won it in the West. Such expressions, as "man's corrupt nature" and "human depravity", come to our mind, loaded with meaning and pathos, and stand- ing in stark contrast to the serenity of most Chinese theorists of human nature. The truth, however, is less obvious and much more complicated. In both East and Wext, the debate was not over the 'same' human nature, but its several 'states', hypothe- tical or experienced. For Mencius and Hsiin-tzu, these were the 'original' nature: man as he was born, and the 'existential' state: man as he found himself in society. In the Christian West, human nature can be said to have 'three moments': 'integral' nature, as it was in Adam before original sin, 'fallen' nature, the result of Adam's 'unhappy' legacy, and 'redeemed' nature, as renewed by the grace of Christ. Within this conceptual frame- work, we can see how, through the triumph of Mencius, East and West concur in agreeing on an 'originally good' human 164-</page><page sequence="5">The Problem of Evil nature, with the difference that Mencius saw this in the infant yet untouched by social culture while Christians attribute it to Adam before the Fall. Hsiin-tzu's 'originally wicked man' could never have known a pre-culture state of goodness, be that at birth or in the person of Adam. The depths and extent of the ravages of the primordial Fall, as well as the depths and extent of the effects of redeeming grace on man, have been the subjects of much theological controversy in the West. Differing interpretations have especially been offered concerning the fallibility of human nature-troubled by "con- cupiscence"-and about the moral "newness" and power ac- corded by "justification". Both these doctrines-which repre- sent realities that are not mutually exclusive-are especially contained in the Epistle to the Romans, and the controversies waged over it reflect a continual tension between two contrary attitudes: Pelagianism and anti-Pelagianism, a tension still being felt today. Both sides admit original sin and the need of grace, but the exact depth and meaning of each has been matter for hot debate. The problem has become more complicated with the discovery of non-Christian cultures and religious philosophies, and the recognition that many "non- Christians" might very well be "anonymous Christians" who have experienced grace. The dividing line between the pagan in the "fallen state" yet untouched by grace, and the Christian himself, a friend of God, has become very difficult to draw, and that, at a time when increasing secularization has made the world more alike in unbelief than in any one faith. The development has therefore been paradoxical. For, at the very moment when theologians are becoming more aware of the -165-</page><page sequence="6">Julia Ching permeating interplay of sin and grace in the whole human race, both in and out of Christianity, as well as of the deeply spiritual and religious bases of all cultures, many individuals and groups seem to be drifting towards religious indifference, a "neopaganism" more pagan than any hitherto-known historic paganism. The task, therefore, has become very urgent, that all men pre- occupied with ultimate concerns should understand one another better, especially since, granted the universal operation of grace, one can hardly label any genuine religious philosophy as belong- ing merely to the oft-disdained category of "natural theology".7 In this perspective, non-Christian insights into human nature can be very valuable to Christian thinkers of today, who are growing conscious of the Hellenic biases of much doctrinal formulation, and anxious, first to return to the Semitic expressi- ons of Christian revelation, and then to re-interpret it meaning- fully to the non-Christian world. This is the motive that prompted the reviewer of Leslie Dewart's The Future of Belief, to insist: It should be a major task of Christian thinkers both solidly knowledge- able in and skeptic with regard to traditional theology to engage in large-scale religious research in at least some of the great number of 7. In our own day, Karl Barth especially, by insisting that Christianity see all reality which is not God in the light of His Word, stands in opposition against any kind of "natural theology", including Aquinas' Aristotelianism, Schleiermacher's pietism and Bultmann's existentialism, as "usurpers" of God's Word. Yet, Barth commends Confucius, Feuerbach and M. Buber on their insights into human nature in Church Dogmatics III, p. 277 f. On this contra- dictory position of Barth, see Hugo A. Meynell, Grace versus Nature: Studies in Karl Barth's "Church Dogmatics" (London: Sheed and Ward, 1965), p. 172-3, - 166 -</page><page sequence="7">The Problem of Evil cultures we have been too long expecting to come to the Church on our own Western terms.8 Just as medieval Scholasticism was an attempt to discuss revealed dogmas by the light of newly discovered Aristotelian principles, so today Christians are faced with this task of re- interpreting the mysteries of faith to Asian nations conscious of their own religious traditions, and yet quite unopposed, in principle, to true dialogue. But the present-day encounter is all the more difficult to Western Christians who must also inte- grate into their religious Weltanschauung the findings of contem- porary experience, be these of the historic kind or as enunciated through the ever-expanding natural, social and psychological sciences, and as reflected upon by our twentieth century philoso- phers. Now, Chinese Neo-Confucianism, especially of the Sung dynasty, fulfilled very much the same role as did medieval Scho- lasticism in Europe, by its successful encounter with Buddhism, accomplished through skilful "exegesis" of Confucian scriptures. And today, any possible revival of Chinese thought necessarily requires the development of a "neo", Neo-Confucianism broad enough to account for Western, including Christian, thinking. It is thus the proposed task of this paper to present the discussions of evil in later Chinese thought, in Neo-Con- fucianism specifically, as represented by several of its greatest names: Chou Tun-i J j , Chang Tsai cc, the Ch'eng 8.

As is well known, after the time of Mencius and Hstin-tzu, Confucian scholars tried to harmonize their teachings, by saying that while human nature possesses the beginnings of virtue, it is not really completely good, and awaits the transforming influ- ence of education. Tung Chung-shu !W{Eff (176-104 BC) especially, correlated the yin-yang [~a theory with Confucian ethics, paralleling hsing In (human nature) with yang, the active or positive cosmic principle, and ch'ing [ f (feelings) with yin, the passive or negative cosmic principle, making nature the source of goodness and feelings the source of evil.9 This categorisation seems arbitrary. But moralists have seldom been sympathetic to feelings as such, and while Thomas Aquinas describes the "passions" as a-moral, he too tends to regard them with dis- favour. 10 In the Han f (202 BC-220 AD) and Wei-Chin -- (220 -420 AD) dynasties, the prevalent tendency was to divide human beings into three "grades". Wang Ch'ung IER (27-100 AD?) offers the opinion that Mencius was referring to people above the average when he spoke of human nature as originally good, 9. Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu .~ c (Luxuriant Gems of the Spring and Autumn Annals). Parts of this book have been translated into English by Wing-tsit Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963). The section on Tung's teaching on human nature and feelings is from p. 275-276. 10. Aquinas treats of the passions in Summa Theologica, I-II, Q. 22-48. He considers them as sense appetites, belonging to the irrational part of the soul, in a human person whose chief characteristic is reason. See Jacques Leclercque, La Philosophie Morale de Saint Thomas devant la Pensie Contemporaine (Louvain: Publications Universitaires, 1955), p. 433. - 168--</page><page sequence="9">The Problem of Evil Hsiin-tzu was referring to people under the average when speak- ing of human nature as originally evil, while Yang Hsiung M* (53 BC-18 AD) was thinking of the average person when he asserted that human nature was mixed with both good and evil.1' Such a theory is fraught with fatalistic consequences regarding man's natural moral destiny, just as certain predestination theo- ries, for example of Calvinism, imply for man's supernatural destiny. Wang Ch'ung, however, following in the steps of Hsiin-tzu, considered even the "born wicked" capable of becoming good, through the influence of education.12 The theory of "grades" reached its climax with the advent of Han Yii aj (768-824 AD), the great T'ang prose-writer, who applied it to both human nature and to feelings. He advocated a return to the way of sages, of Confucius and Mencius, which had been obscured by the predominance of Taoism and Bud- dhism during the time of chaos stretching from the third to the eighth centuries. For this, he has been acclaimed the fore-runner of Neo-Confucianism.13 Han's friend and pupil, 11. Lun-heng '{f (Balanced Inquiries). For an Enslish translaion, see Chan, Source Book, p. 293-296. Wang's ideas might have played an important role in the subsequent "nine-grade ranking system" inaugurated by Emperor Wen Z (220-227 AD) of the Wei dynasty, which led to many abuses, since it was presumed that the scions of the important families belonged to the "higher grades". As to the "grade theory" itself, Wang might have received it from his teacher Pan Piao J)Jpt, one of the historians responsible for the Han Shu jiA (History of the Han Dynasty), which includes a "three-nine" grading classification for legendary and historical figures. 12. For a discussion on this point, see Li Shi Yi, "Wang Ch'ung", in T'ien Hsia Monthly, 5 (October, 1937), 299-302. As to Hsiin-tzu, he definitely maintains that even the born wicked can attain sagehood, an idea which, irrespective of its logic, saved his system from fatalism and also illustrates the "democratic" nature of his thinking, in spite of his insistence on laws for the government of men. 13. For Han's ideas on human nature, see Yiian-hsing -f,c (Inquiry on Human Nature), English translation in Chan, Source Book, 451-453, andYiian-tao T i_ (Inquiry on the Way), also in Chan, 454-456. - 169 -</page><page sequence="10">Julia Ching Li Ao -_-4 (fl. 798) also claimed that nature enables man to be- come a sage and feelings lead him astray. He offers as remedy, through the control of feelings, the "recovery" of man's originally good nature.14 This will continue to be a recurring theme in Neo-Confucian "methodology". Hence, it is interesting to note that in a system of thought which has no doctrine of primor- dial Fall, so much attention should have been given to the possibility of "recovering" an originally good nature. Underly- ing this is an unexplicit recognition of human freedom and an optimistic estimate of man's moral powers with no conscious reference to the world of grace. To all appearances, the Chinese sage is a "self-redeemed" man, a second Adam, who has re- covered his state of original justice, from which he had earlier fallen, not through hereditary, but through personal "sin", to which his fallibility-more precisely, his "concupiscence", natural but not inherited-has kept him open. Still, granted all the doctrinal differences, or rather, the absence of certain doctrinal assumptions in Chinese thought, the recovery of a relative degree of "integrity" remains characteristic of Christian spirituality also: ...in a certain respect the goal of Christian moral maturity consists in a return to Adam's state in Paradise, not certainly in the sense of a return to some possibility still prior to moral decision, but as to a goal which is itself already the fruit and prize of moral concern. In this sense it may be allowed that the ascetic strives for the blessed draO9ase a possessed by Adam in Paradise, as the Greek Fathers often say.'5 14. See Fu-hsing gfc- (Recovery of Nature), in Chan, ibid., 456-458. The idea of recovering one's nature-as well as that of "fasting of the heart or mind"-come originally from Chuang-tzu, but Li Ao gave it clearer ex- pression. 15.

Unlike Confucius and Mencius, both earlier and later Taoists avoided discussions of good and evil. "How much difference is there between 'good' and 'evil'?", says the cryptic Lao-tzu 5 .T6 And into the mouth of Confucius himself, did Chuang- tzu 41 (c. 399-c. 295 BC) put words of the Taoist ideal of the sage, who was not-as was the Confucian-a man of virtue, but the man who "transcended" the practice of virtues in mystical self-forgetfulness.17 On the other hand, the popular movement of religious Taoism, which arose under the Han dynasty and spread among the masses during the Six Dynasties (222-589 AD), con- sidered every kind of physical evil as punishment for sin, and held public penitential ceremonies for the sake of effacement and relief.'s Its adherents did not develop an explicit theory of moral evil, which they apparently sought to avoid, for the sake of personal gain in attaining physical immortality. The intel- lectual Neo-Taoist movement, however, went beyond both Lao- 16. Lao Tzu (Tao-te Ching) 20, in Chan, op. cit., 149. 17. Chuang Tzu 6, ibid., 201.

The Chinese use the same word for "sin" and "crime" (tsui -). It has been put forward that Western society is a "guilt-conscious" society pre-occupied with sin and man's moral responsibility, whereas Chinese society is a "shamec-onscious" society where the sense of wrong is not internalized. In Guilt and Sinin Traditional China (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), Wolfram Eberhard dismisses this theory with a thorough analysis of sociological evidence. - 171 -</page><page sequence="12">Julia Ching tzu and Chuang-tzu in metaphysical speculations. Wang Pi TE (226-249 AD) spoke of Wu (non-being) as ultimate, undifferentiated, pure being'9--resembling the "One" of Plo- tinus, while Kuo Hsiang WT (d. 312 AD) identified T'ien with Tzu-jan 0 M, the physical cosmos or Nature, which was but another name for the self-generating myriad things,20 the "Many" in the mechanical system of Epicurus. Good and evil have little meaning in strict, ontological monism or pluralism. With the given ideal of sagehood as "harmony with Nature", the violation of, or interference with, one's human nature becomes an "ontological" rather than "moral" evil. Besides, in Kuo's system, there was no place for free will. Buddhism developed in China through interactions with Taoism, both on the intellectual and popular levels. The seven early Buddhist schools were pre-occupied with the ques- tion of whether dharma had any ultimate reality, in other words, with the meaning of the Taoist "non-being".21 Their meta- physical discussions remind one of the medieval European con- troversy over the reality of "Universals".22 The Chinese re- 19.

Dharma here refers to "all things", or "elements of existence". The con- troversy, basically, was whether there was an "objective reality" in things, or in anything at all. This doubt resembles more the tendency of modern European philosophers since the time of Descartes, with the philosophical postion of Hume-concerning the mind and reality-closest to that of Hinayana Buddhism. 22. As such, the problem of universals came up in Chinese thought in the pre- Ch'in "school of names" associated with Kung-sun Lung aft (c. 380 BC?), in Hsuin-tzu (fl. 298-238 BC), in the Buddhist Seng-chao @M (384-414- - 172 -</page><page sequence="13">The Problem of Evil fusal to regard the world as illusory, as well as the preference for ethics to metaphysics, prepared the way for the eventual success- ful re-assertion of Confucian morality in the face of Buddhist "indifference". Besides, by the end of T'ang (9th cent. AD), a series of religious persecutions had reduced Buddhism to near impotency. It survived, roughly speaking, under two forms: the Ch'an r- (Zen) sect of artists and intellectuals and the popular Ching-t'u j-c (Pure Land) sect or Amidism. The goal of Ch'an was the attainment of Buddhahood through direct insight beyond processes of thought or volition. Everything else, be it the reading of Scriptures, prayer or good works, was in principle unnecessary. It has therefore been called "Protestant" Bud- dhism.23 The Pure Land sect was a religion of faith in Amida's saving grace. At its best, it bore the most resemblance to Chris- tianity. Basic Buddhist ambivalence towards the problem of moral, however, together with provisions for atonement and purification founded on mechanistic causality, gave rise to many abuses.24 AD)--whose discussion of things and names especially approached the medieval European discussion of the universals. In general, the importance occupied by discussions on the mind and reality in Chinese Buddhism matched the importance occupied by the European scholastic discussion on universals. 23. Hu Shih tAj in called the Ch'an movement a "reformation or revolution in Buddhism". See his article, "Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China: its History and Method", Philosophy East and West, 3 (1953), p. 12. It represented certainly a great departure from original Buddhism, so that one may say that the triumph of Ch'an implied also the failure of Indian Buddhism to establish itself in China or Japan. 24. For a discussion of both Ch'an and Amidism, see Edward Conze, Buddhism, Its Essence and Development (Oxford: Bruno Cassirer, 1957), 200-207. W. Eberhard also remarks on the "irrelevance of moral life" in Chinese Bud- dhism, including Amidism, even though it was a "salvation" religion, since the extreme conclusion of belief in grace as being sufficient was thaa no repentance for sin was required.

However, Neo-Confucianism arose as a reaction against Buddhism, much as medieval Scholasticism began as a reaction against Averroism. An integrated, organic cosmology was developed to counteract the Buddhist view of an illusory world based on the causative action of karma, and, what is more important, an integrated ascetic and mystic doctrine, advocating the control of unruly desires and the practice of ching &amp; or inner reverence-in the spirit of the Buddhist dhyana25-also came into being. Neo-Confucianism, therefore, forged partly-Buddhist weapons to fight Buddhist abuses, especially their neglect of man's social duties. It was mainly in the sphere of ethics, that the claim of a return to Confucius and Mencius was justified. But the Neo-Confucian explanation of evil was strongly coloured by the new concern with metaphysics.26 According to Chou Tun-i (1017-1073), regarded by Chu Hsi as founder of Neo-Confucianism, the world, both of men and things, is the spontaneous production of the interaction between the five elements and the principles of yin and yang, which, in their turn, came from the T'ai-chi ;c, the transcendental 25.

Man represents the summit of the uni- verse, participating in the excellence of the T'ai-chi, and possess- ing the nature wich came to him through the five elements. Human nature is originally good, or, as he expresses it, ch'eng a (sincere). Contact with external things, however, provides the occasion for evil, as a deflection from the good rather than a positive presence. If only we have no selfish desires, our hearts will be like a "mirror", quiet when passive, straight and upright when active.27 This "mirror" image has a long tradition in Chinese thought, going back to Chuang-tzu (fl. 4th cent. BC), who used it to illustrate the ideal of Taoist wisdom, with its impersonal yet immediate apprehension of reality. In a famous episode, the monk Shen-hsiu $fA (605?-706 AD) and his rival, the later Ch'an patriarch Hui-neng (638-713 AD), expressed through it the irreality of the phenomenal world.28 The image has also been used by Christians--Gregory of Nyssa (337-400), pseudo-Dionysius (5th cent.),Ruysbroeck (1293-1381), Marie of the Incarnation (1599-1672) and other mystics. Here, however, the mirror represents the Divine Exemplar, in whose likeness man is created. But Christians, Buddhists and Neo-Confucians, all saw in the "Spiritual Mirror" the need of cleansing-the 27.

The oft-quoted parable of a man's spontaneous reaction at the sight of a child's falling into a well can only be an example of the natural reaction of a cultured human being, and not of raw human nature. Chang Tsai's contribution, there- fore, cleared the ground for a more meaningful dialogue between Christian thinkers and Neo-Confucians. In this respect, it can be pointed out that Paul Tillich's inter- pretation of the primordial Fall comes closest to the assumptions of this Neo-Confucian distinction between "basic" or "essential" nature and the "existential" state in which it is found. Tillich rejects the literal interpretation of the Paradise story and descri- bes "actualised creation" and "estranged existence" as identical. The state of sin represents the transition from "essence" to "existence" ...everything (God) created participates in the transition from essence to existence. He creates the newborn child; but, if created, it falls into the state of existential estrangement... (and), upon growing into maturity, affirms the state of estrangement in acts of freedom which imply responsi- bility and guilt. Creation is good in its essential character. If actualised, it falls into universal estrangement through freedom and destiny.32 Chang also emphasized the importance of ascesis, or "self- cultivation", for the sake of improving the quality of our "en- dowment". Repeating, after Mencius, that "to know the heart completely is to know one's nature and to know Heaven", he 32. Systematic Theology (London: J. Nisbet, 1957), p. 50. Tillich's interpretation of the Fall of Man gives rise to difficulties, which are beyond the scope of this paper. It is only asserted here that the "dual" aspect of human nature explains evil much in the same way as did the Neo-Confucians, although dissimilarities are not absent. - 177 -</page><page sequence="18">Julia Ching sees the practice of love as the means for removing the differences between the self and the non-self, and so of attaining the state of becoming one with all things. After all, man is actually part of Nature, and the truer is his unity with Nature, the better also is his own nature. In a very famous passage, he says: Heaven is my Father, and Earth is my Mother. Even such a small crea- ture as I find an intimate place in their midst. Therefore that which fills the Universe I regard as my body and that which directs the Universe I consider as my nature. All people are my brothers and sisters, and all things are my companions.33 A tendency towards pantheistic mysticism seems obvious. And yet, Chang's union with Nature stops far short of the Hindu Advaita34 of Shankara (9th cent. AD). Not only is his means for attaining this union love, rather than knowledge, but also is this love, with all its cosmic dimensions, a Confucianist, graded love, which guards the necessary distinctions between human relations and man's relations with the cosmos. The life-giving quality of this love, however, receives due attention. In dis- cussing Chang's teaching, Chu Hsi especially quoted his descrip- tion of the work of the sage, the man of jen par excellence: ...to give heart (or consciousness) to Heaven and Earth, to establish the Way for living peoples, to continue the interrupted teaching of the former sages, and to open a new era of peace for coming generations.35 33.

Is not the life-giving movement flowing down from Heaven and Earth to man and then back to Heaven and Earth a worthy analogy for the understanding of the life-giving grace of Christian theology ? The two famous brothers, Ch'eng Hao and Ch'eng I, both accepted the distinction Chang made concerning essential nature and its "concrete" endowment in man. It is, after all, a better conceptual tool than the former, arbitrary predication of "evil" of feelings. In a passage atributed by Chu Hsi to the elder Ch'eng (1032-1085), we read: There are men who are good from childhood on, others who are evil from childhood on. This comes from the natural endowment of ch'i. While good belongs to nature, evil too cannot be said not to belong to nature....36 The younger Ch'eng (1033-1107) also ascribes the good and evil in human nature, to the purity or impurity of the endowment of ch'i. He offers the following explanation for the differentia- tion between basic nature and the "existential" human: Dasein: Theologische Betrachtungen), Ladislaus Boros speaks about the cosmic significance of man's life, including his suffering, and how, "in our inner being, we carry the evolutionary pressure of the universe." This is also Teil- hard de Chardin's idea, as is well known. While Neo-Confucians do not speak explicityly of the value of suffering, their ideal of jen would tacitly include suffering and endurance. 36. Erh Ch'eng i-shu (Surviving Works of the Two Ch'engs). It is not given here, which of the two brothers said this. But Chu Hsi attributes it to the elder, Ch'eng Hao.

When the ch'i is pure, so is ts'ai; when the ch'i is dirty, so too is ts'ai. Ts'ai-capacity-may be good or evil, hsing-Nature-is always good.S7 In order to transform our endowment or capacity, the brothers recommend the reverent custody of the heart or mind, ching &amp;, which helps us to know and experience jen, which in turn brings us back into the mainstream of the greatjen in the life of the uni- verse. Both of them repeated frequently the famous Neo-Confu- cian dictum: the man ofjen is one with Heaven and Earth and all things. But while Ch'eng Hao dwelt almost exclusively on the importance of ching, Ch'eng I added to this "reverence"' or "attentiveness" the need of extending one's knowledge, that is, the knowledge of moral matters, through assiduous study. Asked about the art of moral cultivation, he had said: The sincerity of the will depends upon the extension of knowledge and the extension of knowledge depends upon the investigation of things.... There is principle (li) in everything, and one must investigate principle to the utmost.... When one has accumulated much knowledge he will naturally achieve a thorough understanding like a sudden release.38 On this account, it has often been said that the elder Ch'eng inaugurated the idealistic wing of Neo-Confucianism with its. unilateral emphasis on inner reverence in self-cultivation, while the younger Ch'eng inaugurated the rationalistic wing, which recommended, besides ching, the practice of ko-wu, the "investiga- 37.

While Ch'eng I and Chu Hsi, by insistence on ko-wu fktj, investigation of things and their principles, approach the current of "gradual enlighten- ment" in Ch'an Buddhism, the idea of "sudden release" quoted here suggests a "sudden" enlightenment to which one prepares self by assiduous study. -180 -</page><page sequence="21">The Problem of Evil tion of things", as an essential means towards self-transformation and sagehood. This divergence within Neo-Confucianism itself resembles the divergence between the Augustinian (or Franciscan) and the Thomist (or Dominican) schools in medieval European scholasticism, with the difference or emphasis on love or knowledge. And if Chu Hsi (1130-1200), the great synthesi- zer, can be compared to St. Thomas Aquinas (1206-1280), so can Lu Chiu-ytian Ncc[lI1 (1139-1193), his friend and "rival" thinker, be compared to St. Bonaventure (1221-1274). A man of letters, a historian, a government official and a philosopher, Chu Hsi attached himself to the ideas of Ch'eng I, reaffirmed the basic doctrines of Confucianism and brought its development over the centuries into a harmonious whole-while giving it a new complexion. Taking over from Chou Tun-i the concept of T'ai-chi or Supreme Ultimate, and uniting it with that of ii f (reason or principle of organization), to which Ch'eng I had already given prominence, he taught that the Supreme Ultimate consists of li in its totality, and is complete in all things as well as in each individually. It explains the reality and universality of things. There is, however, another element, ch'i-Chang Tsai's word-which explains the physical form and the individuality of things. While seemingly dualistic, li and ch'i are never separate.39 They have been compared to form and matter in Aristotelian philosophy, on account of which Chu Hsi, who saw no need for a Creator,-as would 39.

This is what Stanislas Le Gall, SJ, says of Chu Hsi: ...beau diseur autant que philosophe detestable, cet homme est parvenu A imposer, depui plus de sept siecles, A la masse de ses compatriotes une explication toute matirialiste des anciens livres.40 Was Chu Hsi a materialist? Since the concept of "materi- alism" comes from the West, it might be more enlightening to put first the question, was Aristotle, who regarded matter as eternal, a materialist? If the answer is negative, on account of Aristotle's belief in spiritual causations, and especially in an "Unmoved Mover", we may next examine Chu Hsi's "Supreme Ultimate", which is as impersonal as Aristotle's God, but which can hardly be reduced to a uniquely material principle. The question of why God would permit the occurrence of evil, or man's potential for evil, however, never arose in Neo-Confucian- ism, since the Supreme Ultimate, not being a personal Absolute, cannot accept responsibility for evil. As for the presence of evil in human nature, Chu Hsi account- ed for it by taking over the distinctions made by Chang Tsai and the two Ch'engs: Whenever there is li, there is ch'i. Whenever there is ch'i, there is li. Those who receive a ch'i that is clear, are the sages in whom Nature is like a pearl lying in clear water. But those who receive a ch'i that is 40.

This is just taken for granted. The dis- tinction, after all, is an ontological, not a moral one. Mo- rality enters the picture only when human nature moves from tranquility to activity, when "feelings" have been aroused or stirred; in "philosophical" language, when free volitional acts have been posited. Granted this understanding, a contempo- rary explanation of dualism in man as the occasion for evil is perfectly consonant with the Neo-Confucian proposal: To say that man is fallible is to say that the limitation peculiar to a being who does not coincide with himself is the primordial weakness from which evil arises.42 A partial explanation of "turbidity" in human nature is given in Chu's theory of "desire", jen yii uA (human desire), also called ssu yii (selfish desire) in the individual. This "de- sire", which is characteristic of all men, is of metaphysical origin. Distinguishing between "nature", as the pre-stirred state of the human heart or mind, and "feelings" as the post-stirred state, he says: Desire emanates from feelings. The heart (or mind) is comparable to water, nature is comparable to the tranquillity of still water, feeling is comparable to the flow of water, and desire is comparable to its waves. 41. Chu-tzu yii-lei 4. Let it be remembered that the Neo-Confucians, after Mencius, held that all men can be sages. Thus, "turbidity" of ch'i does not necessarily present an invincible obstacle for moral perfection. One only has to cleanse the pearl of its mud. See also Callahan, op. cit., p. 7-8. 42.

From the most essential and most fundamental about oneself to every single thing or affair in the world, even the meaning of one word or half a word, everything should be investigated to the utmost, and none of it is unworthy of attention.44 Chu Hsi's contemporary, Lu Chiu-yiian, objected to the duali- stic explanation of ii and ch'i as components of the universe and of man, as well as to the undue emphasis on learning. Lu regards all things as one: the human heart or mind is li, and since the universe is also li, the two are really one, as microcosm and mac- rocosm. There is no need, therefore, to pursue wide knowledge. One only has to know the heart exhaustivly. For this reason, he has been described as an idealist philosopher. Lu shows no interest in ch'i. In discussing human nature, he merely says that goodness is prior and innate, while evil is poste- rior and acquired. A key to the understanding of evil is wu-yii "V, (material desire), which, however, is not explained. Where there is good, there must be evil. (The transition from one to the other) is truly (like) turning over one's hands. Goodness is so from the very beginning, whereas evil comes into existence only as a result of such a 'turning over'.45 43.

Indeed, it explains nothing. However, Lu probably had no intention of explaining anything, least of all, the presence of a mystery. Lu simply recognizes evil and attempts to deal with it positively. Being opposed, as were all Neo-Confucians, to the pessimistic Buddhist outlook on life, he evinces a belief in human perfectibility, so characteristic of Chinese thought. If he differs from Chu, it is mainly for practical reasons. Chu advocates the investigation of things in the view of attaining virtue, while Lu saw moral cultivation in terms of self-knowledge followed by the practice of innate, human virtues. His argu- ment is that sagehood ought to be sought within man, rather than beyond him. "If we know the fundamentals in our study", he says, "then all the Six Classics are our footnotes."4" And also: The universe is my heart and mind, and my heart and mind is the universe. Sages appeared tens of thousands of generations ago. They shared this heart; they shaared this principle. Sages will appear tens of thousands of generations to come. They will share this heart; they will share this principle."7 All that Lu talked about, was this "heart" or "mind". And yet, unfortunately, he has never explained its nature fully. Christian literature has much more to say about this fundamental principle of all human activity, the deepest recess of the person and his mystery, whether that be called heart, mind or soul: 46.

I should like to point out that the Chinese word hsin L,, translated as heart or mind, includes the connotations of both these English words. It refers to the deepest principle in man from which all acts flow. - 185 -</page><page sequence="26">Julia Ching The superior parts of our soul are like a living mirror of God, where He has printed His eternal image and where no other image can come.... All that God knows distinctly, in the mirror of His wisdom.., all that is truth and life, (in so far as) this life is Himself, for there is in Him nothing outside His own nature.48 Lu's teachings did not yield as much influence as Chu's, which were incorporated into the official examinations in 1313. They were nearly forgotten when Wang Shou-jen (1472-1529) came to the scene, more than three centuries after Lu. A statesman, a general, and a man of letters as well, this great philosopher of the Ming dynasty shone alone where others before him had to share the limelight. Reviving Lu's "school of the heart (or mind)", Wang disagrees with Chu's dualism in metaphysics and in an- thropology, as well as in the dual emphasis on inner reverence and "outer" investigations. He complains that scholarship- which should be a pursuit of wisdom-has degenerated into an interest in "fragmentary and isolated details" outside of the self. He reaffirms the all-embracing nature of the heart, and especially of its innate power of knowing good and evil-hang-chih .Ja (moral intuition). To reach sagehood, man merely has to de- velop to the full his innate liang-chih, which is nothing other than T'ien-li hW, the principle of Heaven: Our nature is the substance of the heart (or mind), and Heaven is the source of our nature. To exert the heart to the utmost is to develop fully one's nature. Only... (then can one)... 'know the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth.'49 Wang's notion of the liang-chih is the culmination of the basic 48.

If the ideal of sagehood implies the unity between man and Heaven-the word referring earlier to a personal Absolute, and later to a less anthropomorphic and more impersonal T'ai-chi-then the heart, with its innate moral intuition, is doubtless the place where this communion takes place. The concept of the man who practises inner reve- rence, and comes into communion with the Absolute, is very close to the ideal of Christian mysticism: German mysticism often named as its ideal the man 'of the heart' (innig), the 'collected' (gesammelt) man, that is, whose whole activity is an exhaustive expression of his innermost centre and his innermost vital decision, and who therefore remains 'collected' in this innermost centre without being dispersed in anything alien to his decision."5 The philosophy of both Lu and Wang has been described as "subjective ontological monism". Subjective and monistic they certainly were, but their monism was not strictly an "ontolo- gical" one. By saying that "the heart contains everything", they did not necessarily deny the existence of an objective uni- verse. Far from it. Both men were practical moralists, not speculative metaphysicians. If they have given the impression of teaching an "ontological monism", it is on account of the absence of an explicit principle of "analogy" in Chinese thoyght, whick keeps it open to mistaken, univocal interpretations. And so it is my contention that the "rationalist" and "idealist" cur- rents of Neo-Confucianism represent two approaches to spiri- tuality, which are related to the divergence of the schools of "gradual" and "sudden" enlightenment in the development 50.

The "rationalists" re- semble the traditionalists, who emphasize the practice of moral virtues, and therefore, man's role in his search for moral per- fection, and the "existentialists"-for lack of a better name, the word "mystical" being ambivalent-who highlight the role of God, of grace, and of direct interpersonal relationship between the soul and its indwelling Guest. Is it besides not possible, that, in our present dissatisfaction with the Greek-Aristotelian-"happ;ness" ethics implicit in Christian morality, the idea of moral self-fulfilment, such as expressed in the doctrine of liang-chih, contains great potential for fruitful reflection? Moral self-fulfilment needs not neces- sarily be selfish, especially when man's relationship and openness to God is recognized. Man's purposiveness and striving, thus, reside in his seeking creatively, not to be happy, but to be. The Christian doctrine of grace can be totally integrated with this idea if we keep in mind that the free self- creation of man takes place in the presence of God....51 Such a perspective would free Christian morality from certain oft-valid charges of the exploitation of religious "illusions". Besides, it denies nothing fundamentally genuine in the "hap- piness" principle. As Paul Tillich has remarked, the Greek word sueaecpovia has suffered much in its English translation of "happiness", which, in turn, has deteriorated badly in meaning. 51.

Alle the same, the fact of evil becomes a great problem in Wang's optimistic philosophy. Even the emotions, which have been the "scapegoat" in Chinese moralism, are regarded by him as functions of liang-chih: When the seven feelings (-,1c)53 follow their natural course, they are functions of the intuitive knowledge (liang-chih), and cannot be divided into good or evil. But at the same time one should not allow them to have any attachment (to things) because such attachment on the part of any one of them constitutes selfish desire and obscures the liang-chih.54 Towards the end of his life, Wang propounded "Four Maxims" which were to arouse great controversy after his death. These read: 1. The absence of good and evil characterizes the original substance of the heart. 2. The presence of good and evil characterizes its exercise of thought (or volition). 3. The knowledge of good and evil characterizes its innate knowledge. 4. The doing of good and ridding of evil characterizes its correction of things.55 A logical interpretation of the First Maxim would imply that Wang regarded human nature, which he identifies with both li (reason) and hsin (heart), as being originally neither good nor 52.

This was the interpretation of Wang Chi IE., a disciple of Shou-jen, who favours complete "spontaneity" or non-inter- ference with the heart (or mind). Such an attitude brought about many abuses, together with a disdain for moral self-cultivation. Another disciple, Ch'ien Te-hung c ' f, argues that distinctions between good and evil exist, and that moral efforts are required to do good and overcome evil. The difficulty, of course, lies in the seeming self-contradictoriness of the Four Maxims, and of the First Maxim with regard to Shou-jen's constant teaching that true knowledge of the heart-knowledge united with action -is sufficient for the attainment of sagehood. A later scholar, Huang Tsung-hsi '$ (1610-1695), explains that the First Maxim refers merely to a certain stage of personal development, at which neither good nor bad volitions arise. The misunder- standing has been taking the "post-stirring" stage of liang-chih for the "pre-stirring" stage, which means, confusing volitions or moral activities with the principle of these activities, the heart or mind itself.5" While the suggestion of "personal develop- ment" is not entirely satisfying, the distinction between "pre- stirring" and "post-stirring" is an important one. It seems that Chinese thinkers have usually insisted on the basic goodness of the human heart as a fundamental principle of morality, in a system in which a supra-human principle, even if present, has always been ambiguous. In spite of his logical bent, Hsiin- 56. See Ming-ju hsiieh-an Ba)~-f (Philosophical Records of the Ming Scholars), 1:10. This work is available in Chinese only.

For orthodox Confucianism knows nothing of "grace"- as does Christianity. As far as Wang Shou-jen is concerned, all we can say is that, had he not died at the age of 56, he might have left us a lucid explanation of his Four Maxims. The difference between the "pre-stirring" and "post-stirring" states of the heart or mind is important because of the implicit recognition of freedom and its exercise, which alone can confer a moral quality on our interior or exterior activity. This is fun- damental to any moral system, and that is why, we may say, the mystery of evil resides in that of freedom. In discussing "The Theological Concept of Concupiscentia", Karl Rahner points out the essentially "natural" character of "concupiscentia", as something immediately given with human nature, even in its "pure" state. Speaking in existentialist terms of the human person as "man in so far as he freely disposes of himself by his decision", and of human nature as "all that in man which must be given prior to this disposal", he describes "theological" concupiscentia as a tension or dualism between "person" and "nature" : There is much in man which always remains in concrete fact somehow impersonal, impenetrable and unilluminated for his existential decision; merely endured and not freely acted out. It is this dualism between person and nature... that we call concupiscence in the theological sense. While it does... find its concrete experiential expression in a dualism of spirituality and sensibility, it is not identical with the latter.57 This concupiscentia cannot be qualified as "morally evil", since it precedes the free decision. Rahner, however, is aware that, 57. Karl Rahner, Theological Investigations I, op. cit., p. 369. - 191 -</page><page sequence="32">Julia Ching in Romans 6-8, "concupiscence" has been termed "sin", adpap- ria. He reasons, therefore, that it can be called "evil" in one sense: in so far as it is only present in man in its concrete form, in virtue of "the Fall of the first man", as an experienced contra- diction in man himself, admittedly so according to Paul, Augus- tine, the great Scholastics,the Reformers and Pascal. In this case, it is the "concupiscence", not of "pure nature", but of "fallen nature".58 As regards moral endeavour as "recovery" of a certain "integrity", he also makes a distinction between the "integrity" of Adam in Paradise, and the recovered "inno- cence" of the perfect Christian: In Adam the person's freedom... made it possible for him exhaustively to engage his nature both in a good and in an evil direction. The freedom of... the (Christian) saint is the freedom of a man who has succeeded in surrendering his whole being... to God totally.59 Human fallibility, after all, is related to man's finite, created freedom, without which there can be no love in mutual friendship between God and the creature. That is why, if the mystery of evil is rooted in that of freedom, freedom, in turn, is rooted in the mystery of love. Besides, from the Christian viewpoint, it is yet another mystery which distinguishes between Neo- Confucian and Christian answers to the problem of evil: 58. Ibid., Although there is no "primordial Fall" in orthodox Chinese thought, there has been, in popular Buddhism, a tendency to regard human beings as having been originally good, but having later become evil in the course of history. According to some popular texts, the dividing line came at the end of the Chou dynasty (early 3rd cent. BC). This idea probably derived from that of kalpa (world era) in philosophical Buddhism. But the Confucians did not explicitly discuss such a possibility, although they usually acclaimed the goodness of former sages, and decried the moral degeneration of their own days.
