<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID BEYNON From Techno-cute to Superf lat: Robots and Asian Architectural Futures It may surprise some of you when I say that I first began to acquire a knowledge of Buddhism through a study of robots, in which I am still engaged today. It may surprise you even more when I add that I believe that robots have Buddha- nature within them - that is, the potential for attaining Buddhahood. -Mori Masahiro, The Buddha in the Robot: A Robot Engineer's Thoughts on Science and Reiigion THE ROBOT The Thai architect Sumet Jumsai's former Bank of Asia building (now United Overseas Bank) is one of the most distinctive sights on the Bangkok skyline. Approaching its twenty-story bulk along Sathorn Road, the building looms as a stack of giant cubic forms (Figure 1, left). However on closer inspection, it becomes clear that this stack of cubes is actually a giant robot. The building's tripartite vertical division can be distinguished as "legs," "body," and "head," each articulated by strips of curtain walling (Figure 1, right). On each side of the "legs," ground floor openings are surrounded by canopies that mimic robot tank-track feet (Figure i, left). Oversized "bolts" emerge from higher 000</page><page sequence="2">figure i. Former Bank of Asia building (now United Overseas Bank), Bangkok. Left : View along Sathorn Road. Right: View of front. Photographs by the author. up (Figure 2, right), while at the front of the head facing the street, there are reflective glass "eyeballs" partially covered by louvered "eyelids" and twin an- tennae. While all this is quite startling in a bank building, in a sense, the use of mechanistic imagery is not so strange. The bank was completed in 1986, the same year as Richard Rogers's Lloyds Bank and Norman Foster's Hong Kong Shanghai Bank buildings. However, while the Bank of Asia's technologically based imagery might be broadly comparable to these other banks, it lacks their coldly mechanistic representation of ducts, struts, and pipes. Instead, Jumsaťs robot is unashamedly anthropomorphic in its expression of technol- ogy. Its robot "eyelids" were even intended to "wink" at night, accompanied by lighting that pulsated to the rhythm of "The Robot Symphony," a piece by a local composer.1 By anthropomorphizing the robot, the Bank of Asia blends humanity and technology in a manner similar to the Japanese toy robots from which its imagery is derived, and so renders explicit notions about technology that are quite different from its British high-tech contemporaries. It looks forward to a future in which the information age will be friendly and anthropomorphic. There is no sense of humanity's alienation from high technology. Moreover, 130 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="3">figure 2. Former Bank of Asia building (now United Overseas Bank), Bangkok. Left : "Caterpillar tracks" on side of building. Right: "Bolts" on side of building. Photographs by the author. the robot's expression is strangely endearing, even cute, a curious attribute for the twenty-story headquarters of a major financial institution. The robot identity of the building is only skin-deep, especially now that the original foyer, adorned with rather anthropotechnical sculptures of Thaveechai Nitip- rabha, has been replaced by something more conventionally bland. The robot identity is now confined to the skin of the building. Underneath its techno- cute packaging, the business that is the Bank of Asia is presumably no more endearing than any other financial institution. Yet the layering of such ap- parently contradictory expressions and attributes in Jumsai's design make it a fascinating subject, particularly if we place it in the context of more recent developments. Jumsai's Japanese-derived robot is now over twenty years old, and, since its completion, three characteristics of the building - its machine/ animist identity, its portrayal of this identity as endearing, and its reference to a specifically Japanese popular culture - have all become more globalized phenomena. Because of this, it is worth examining the interconnections be- tween these three characteristics. In the postwar period, Japan was a land known in the West first for its clever imitation and then its enhancement of Western products - as Iwabuchi Kõichi describes them, "culturally odorless0 FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT 131</page><page sequence="4">technological advancements such as Walkmans and karaoke.2 More recently, however, more overtly Japanese products such as manga and anime have be- come popular outside Japan itself, and so the symbolic use of a Japanese robot in a Southeast Asian work of architecture raises the question of whether the robot is a symbol of Japanese influence or an expression of a more dif- fused "Asian" modernity. WHY THE ROBOT? In the Bank of Asia, Jumsai demonstrates a particular attitude toward tech- nology and its relation with humanity. He describes his design in the follow- ing terms: But first, machine as we know it in this century has to be exorcised. It must no longer remain a separate entity or elevated on a pedestal to worship. This exorcism has been completed in the Sathorn Robot. Now the machine, this robot, is no longer a "big deal": it has become part of our daily lives, a friend, ourselves. It has entered the first phase of the 21st century revolution.3 This idea of the machine being not only a friend but "ourselves" is a critical point in Jumsai s exorcism of the machine. In the unthreatening anthropo- morphic guise of the robot, technology - so overwhelming and sublimely menacing in high-tech - is blended into the world of humanity. At the risk of essentializing, this is quite different from the Western preconceptions about robots. Whereas the friendly robot exists within Western popular culture, from the clowning Robot from Lost in Space , to C-3PO from Star Wars, they are definitively not human, no matter how much they emulate human be- havior. Mixtures of human and machine exist but are rarely as friendly. They may be on the side of good, like Arnold Schwarzeneggers Terminator in the second and third films of that series, but they retain a sense of menacing and disconcerting otherness.4 More often, like the Borg in Star Trek : The Next Gen- eration , they represent the implacable horror of subsumption into the Other, into the imagined undifferentiatedness outside (Western) humanity.5 Taking this point further, identification of the cyborg with the automaton, and via the analogy of the doll with the feminine, gives a misogynistic undercurrent to this fear of the human-machine. A further discussion of the Borg, with their hive mind and bee-like queen, is certainly suggestive of this idea. Donna Haraway has outlined from a feminist viewpoint how the machine has been 132 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="5">„ , , , WE ARE INTENPEC?

She counters this idea with the argument tECHNO-AMIMIST SPIRIT, that the reality of existence is that we are all really cyborgs - part animal, part machine - 'J~ and sees the figure of the cyborg as possibly redemptive in its disassociation from traditional structures: "a cyborg world might be about social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines."6 Rey Chow s elaboration of this argument provides an interesting interpretation of the robot building: Being "automatized" means being subjected to social exploitation whose ori- gins are beyond ones individual grasp, but it also means becoming a spec- tacle whose "aesthetic" power increases with one's increasing awkwardness and helplessness.7 The Bank of Asia robot, in its anthropomorphism of the automaton, seems to do precisely this. Its visual impact is both tame and powerful, its expression of the technological future distilling the massive bulk of financial construction to a singular and personable image. We are intended to feel em- pathy with the building, to connect with its techno-animist spirit. In this, the building aligns with a tradition of empathetic Japanese robots. As Timothy Hornyak relates, the Japanese interest in robots has deep roots.8 He notes the existence of an amusement park in Osaka in 1662 that featured apparently self-automated puppets, as well as Karakuri zui (Automaton figures), a 1796 treatise that details how to make automated karakuri puppets.9 Such puppets were widely popular, especially chahakobi ningyõ, a wind-up boy-puppet who could serve tea. The poet Kobayashi Issa s haiku captured its appeal: Such coolness by the gate as the tea-serving doll brings another cup10 From Aibo™ the robot dog to Asimo™ the robot humanoid, there have been great efforts in Japan to create personable and empathetic robots. There is even, conflating cuteness and cyborg technology to its extreme, Hello Kitty ROBO™ and the Therapeutic Robot: Paro™, a baby robot seal.11 Japanese pop- ular culture also abounds with human characters augmented by technology. Anime from Mobile Suit Gundam (1979, Kidõ senshi Gandamu) to Bubblegum FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT 133</page><page sequence="6">Crisis Tokyo 2040 (1998, Baburugamu kuraishisu TOKYO 2040 ) have protago- nists who merge with machines in a manner portrayed as both technologically spectacular and, in the context of their narratives, quite normal. While there are other pathologies within the genre, this easy acceptance of the infiltra- tion of the machinic into the human contrasts with the dread with which such hybrids are held in their equivalents in the West. This contrast leads to an attitude that Ueno Toshiya has termed techno-Orientalism - the way in which, through Western eyes, the Japanese eagerness to embrace the robot is symptomatic of their intrinsic repression of human individuality.12 He sees in current Western depictions of Japan in particular and East Asia in general an echo of the Orientalist attitudes of their colonialist forebears as eloquently delineated by Edward Said. In this framing, Japanese are Japanoids, cyborgs with or without their robot suits and dogs. Conversely, as Mori Masahiro, a Japanese robotics engineer writing on Buddhism, has suggested, such a con- joining of human and machine is no less natural than any other phenomenon, and the idea of a distinction or opposition between humanity and machines - as between humanity and nature - is only a construct that obscures the ac- ceptance of the Buddha-hood present not just in the human but also in the cyborg and the robot.13 This anthropomorphizing of the robot brings us back to Jumsai s bank, for as he states, the exorcising of the machine involves seeing it as a mirror of the self, a portrait in a different medium. The robot is literally animated, endowed with a life force that, drawing on the animist origins of Asian beliefs, lies inherent in all things. While the Thai context is in many ways quite differ- ent to Japan, there are some shared or parallel aspects of East and Southeast Asian cultures that may explain the empathetic robot s cross-cultural appeal. In Thai culture, the landscape is inhabited by phi (spirits), which coexist with Thai Buddhist practice in a way that combines indigenous animist beliefs with Hindu-Buddhist cosmology. Kirsch uses the example of the phi-thewada (phi + Hindu-Buddhist deity) to illustrate this aspect of the traditional Thai belief system.14 These spirits have their equivalents in other Asian cultures. For in- stance in Malaysia, despite the quite different theological overlay of Islam, belief in keramat (spirits) remains strong, manifesting in both animate and inanimate objects. Even Chinese property developers in Malaysia sometimes perform rituals of propitiation to keramat , demonstrating the degree to which such beliefs remain potent in contemporary life.15 In Japan, kami are intrinsic elements in Shinto. Inherently formless entities, kami may manifest in objects such as trees or stones and have the power to influence human affairs favor- ably or unfavorably, depending on their ritual treatment. The worship of kami 134 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="7">is a folk tradition, but as Shinto has integrated with imperial institutions, they, like Thai phi , have become as deities. The kami, Amaterasu-Ömikami, for example, is both the sun goddess and the ancestress of Japans imperial family.16 Despite these identifications, a landscape of kami is nonhierarchal, fragmented, as each locality is influenced by its own combination of spirits. Allied with a Japanese history of frequent natural disasters, such as fires and earthquakes, which have contributed to the conception of buildings as temporary and replaceable, the Shinto/Buddhist sensibility has led to a par- ticular set of attitudes toward urban environments and to what may seem to Western eyes to be inanimate objects within them. To return to Thailand, Brian McGraths description of Bangkok is strikingly similar: Thai Buddhist social order employs this world-view to synthesise vastly dif- ferent forms of knowledge and practices. Cities here are ecumenical and tol- erant, heterogeneous and cosmopolitan, populated with a vast diversity of ghostly and living creatures within heavenly and hellish realms, and all that lies between. This polystructured and complexly layered ecology historically accommodated Bodhisattvas, spirits and gods of Buddhism, Animism, and Brahmanism as well as traders and missionaries from Japan to Holland.17 These attitudes might also apply to the future where new and often in- tangible technologies contribute to the transformable nature of spirit; hence Moris comment on the Buddha-potential of robots. However, the deliberately endearing means of representing this quality draws in another pervasive as- pect of Japanese pop culture, and one that also disconcerts the cultural com- mentators of the West (as it does some in the East) - the realm of the cute. This aspect of popular culture is by now a regional and almost a global phe- nomenon. In utilizing an endearing image, the bank joins a multitude of other corporate and institutional entities in East and Southeast Asia that project a cute image, often by the means of a cuddly cartoon creature. The reasons for this are complex. The Japanese term for cute, kawaii - which has itself become as internationalized as its content - contains an older meaning, kawaisõ (piti- ful), which raises the question as to why an aesthetic of cuteness should be so popular.18 One explanation is that the cult of cuteness is a desire to extend (early) childhood, a reaction to the inevitable drudgery of (particularly female) adulthood in societies that traditionally have had very strict social structures and hierarchies, but are now offering the ways and means to avoid or subvert them. A more pathological interpretation highlights the sometimes creepy jux- taposition of cheerily bland flatness and bodily deformity in cute characters, FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT 135</page><page sequence="8">hinting at, if not blatantly expressing, the abjection and angst behind the ap- parently smiling innocent exterior, like that of a roused Pokémon, that swiftly turns from apparently inane happiness to startling fury.19 More prosaically, in East and Southeast Asian societies, assertiveness and directness are generally valued less than smiling deference. More specifically in relation to the robot building s Thai context, Philip Cornwel-Smith, in his survey of Thai popular culture, suggests that "na rak (cute) resonates with several core Thai values: sanuk (fun sensibility), suay (beauty), sabai (contentment), and krengjai (def- erential consideration)."20 The Bank of Asias winking robot arguably embod- ies all of these qualities, and as Cornwel-Smith continues, "It is also urban, plastic, and commercial, and thus pop. That suits another aspiration: looking dem (modern)."21 While the imagery of the robot might be considered akin to the multitude of endearing characters used in the logos, mascots, and other public, corporate imagery, cuteness is not something commonly attributed to buildings themselves. In the West, architecture is usually considered to be too big, too permanent, and too serious to be regarded as cute, though in East and Southeast Asia, this is not necessarily the case. In conjunction with the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Japanese architecture studio Atelier Bow- Wow has categorized some of the many buildings on tiny, marginal sites in Tokyo as "Pet Architecture." They argue that architecturally, such buildings occupy a place in relation to the larger surrounding buildings analogous to pets in relation to people, and so, whatever their physical characteristics, they are "small, humor- ous, and charming," offering visual approachability due not just to their size but also to the lack of design or technical sophistication in their composition.22 While the robot bank has no lack of design, technical sophistication is not part of its expression, subordinated in favor of the animated image. SURFACE AND ESSENCE The use of the robot also raises the question of the use of artifice more gen- erally. At first glance the Bank of Asia's enormous bolts and fake caterpillar- tracks appear to correlate with the contemporaneous wave of oversized Po-Mo pediments and candy columns that were appliquéd to the buildings of the 1980s. Jumsai, however, has clearly outlined a stance quite contrary to Post- modern Classicism as well as to High-Tech, and one that correlates with more recent developments in Asian art and architecture. His first point is that while the use of Classical pediments, capitals, and columns looks backward into the past - a specifically Western past - the robot looks toward the future, an 136 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="9">Eastern future. Jumsai sees the use of revivalist Classicism in Asia as symp- tomatic of the legacy of Western cultural paternalism. That new faux-temple apartments are still as prevalent in contemporary Thailand as they were in 1986 indicates the persistence of this legacy, but the difference in choice of decorative elements is not the only thing that distinguishes the robot from its 1980s contemporaries. Taking up the argument that the robot image has little to do with the purpose of the building, Jumsai suggests that the robot wrapping has a certain transformative power: It need not be a robot. It could be a host of other metamorphoses as long as they act as agents to free the spirit from the present intellectual impasse and propel it forwards into the next century.23 That the surface should have this power suggests a relationship between image and content that is quite removed from Western ideas of superficiality and essence - ideas that have discredited Western Postmodernist architecture. Instead, its exuberant surface recalls the sometimes intensely decorative but highly symbolic skins of traditional Thai chedi (stupas) that are encrusted with the symbolic meanings of Theravada Buddhism (Figure 3). 24 Additionally - and Jumsai is explicit in his opinions about the possibilities of architectural con- nections between Southeast Asia and Japan25 - the robot image is connected with the ongoing Japanese interest in the power of the surface. The word superficial describes the literal and ontological emptiness of something whose surface hides a lack within. It is indicative of the modern Western view that the surface, be it wrapping, skin, or container, is merely the covering of the essential thing inside it. The surface, in this estimation, may be truthful, obscurant, or deceitful about its contents, but not productive. However in both traditional and contemporary Japanese terms, the surface is considerably more intrinsic to the thing that it wraps or contains. From the ritual roping of rocks in sacred Shinto places, to the elaborate wrapping of even ordinary retail items; from the artful plating of kaiseki meals to the presence of uniformed greeters in department stores; there is a belief that the image, impression, or surface of a thing contributes to, if not helps to determine, its content. The quintessential Japanese garment, the kimono, illustrates this. Kimono are renowned for their exquisite designs, displayed to best effect by being hung flat, unlike a tailored garment, which requires a body underneath it to reveal its proper form. As Liza Dalby describes it, the flat nature of the kimono serves to "shift the issue of fashion away from shape to the areas of color, pattern, and decorative detail."26 A kimono is made up of FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT 137</page><page sequence="10">figure 3. Royal Palace, Bangkok. Left : Chedi in palace grounds. Right: Close-up of chedi surface. Photographs by the author. straight lengths of fabric, upon which designs are often nonsequential. On a body they often seem like fragments of a larger design, the center of which is beyond its boundaries. Unlike a tailored garment that is molded around the form of the body, a kimono instead modifies the body, in form and in action, to suit the cylindrical shape determined by its two-dimensionality. Waists are padded, breasts are compressed and legs restricted, so that the kimonos fabric, when wrapped round the body, forms a perfect cylinder. The kimono is, arguably, a 2.5-dimensional garment. Even when wrapped around the obvious three-dimensionality of the body, it is essentially a flat surface. This interest in the surface also has a specific history in Japanese art, traceable through traditions of painting and drawing, to contemporary pop- ular media such as manga and anime. Conjecture about meanings, such as whether the emphasis on surface or container meaningfully contributes to, or merely represses, what it represents or contains, have been debated in re- lation to these media. However, what is consistently argued is that depth and surface share a different relationship seen through Japanese percep- tions of their meaning.27 Japanese animated filmmakers, for instance, un- like makers of recent Disney or Pixar animations, have resisted the illusion of three-dimensionality offered via computer-generated imagery, retaining a visual style that has been described as "almost in denial of their impulse 138 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="11">to animate/"28 In art, these meanings have recently been made explicit by Murakami Takashi in his promotion of the superflat movement, led by him- self, Aoshima Chiho, Nara Yoshitomo, and other artists. The term superflat was coined by Murakami to describe the aesthetic that is by its nature two- dimensional, but instead of alluding to depth, emphasizes its intrinsic flat- ness.29 Azuma Hiroki describes Murakamis own art in the following terms: Resolutely planar, his works prevent the construction of visual depth. This is what Murakami means by Super Flat. That he occasionally refers to even his three-dimensional sculptural work as Super Flat provides testament to the consistency of his sensibility. Murakami not only rejects the spatial in the planar, he sees space itself as an assemblage of planes.30 A a r - • • j «.w that involves i . i TRAPITIONAUV, A a way or r seeing - is • required • j that «.w involves i a steady, . i mov- it-. while the overall urc, effect JAPANESE ARTISTS' ing gaze across a scene.

Traditionally, Japanese artists worked in a Chinese-derived tradition, where isometry had been developed to simulate depth. They drew on particular representational conventions, in which landscape elements of similar size were taken closer to the viewer if they were lower in the composition. This was effective in elon- gated, vertical scroll paintings, where distant mountains at the top of the im- age were equal in size to closer ones below. In Takahashi Sohei's Pure View of Stream and Hills, the distant trees at the tops of the highest hills are no smaller than the trees overhanging the small boat in the bottom of the picture. It was also effective in landscapes portrayed on Japanese folding screens. An iso- metric view meant that the viewer could perceive whatever was illustrated - pavilions, natural features, courtyards, castles - equally, without having to stand in a particular position. This image was best experienced by moving in front of the screen, with the image (literally) unfolding as one moved. This un- folding was made not just literal but physical in Japanese handscrolls. Dating back to the twelfth century CE, handscrolls contained a mixture of narrative FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT f39</page><page sequence="12">painting and text, designed to be held and slowly unrolled by the viewer.32 All these forms of painting, as Murakami argues, "control the speed of its observers gaze,"33 a perceptual device employed by contemporary Japanese media such as manga, anime, and his own superflat art. However, in portraying landscapes within the truncated proportions of the woodblock print, this method was much less effective. Because of this, ukiyo-e artists began to use different methods to portray built environments and landscapes, combining traditional methods with new techniques from the West.

With the viewer s eye unable to drift upward or sideways for any distance, Western perspective was much more effective in representing background depth. However, in the foreground, isometric methods of projecting buildings and interiors maintained a level of immediacy and familiarity. Hokusais A Treasury of Loyalty series illustrates this combination of isometric and per- spectivai projection in several examples. In Act 6, an outdoor background is depicted in Western perspective while, in the foreground, the interior is done in isometric projection. In Act 10, Hokusai combines two: an outdoor scene in Western perspective and an indoor scene, which is shown with the build- ing s walls and roof removed, a traditional way of viewing detail from above. Perspectivai techniques were also combined with other criteria in ukiyo-e land- scapes. Thomas Looser describes how, in Hiroshiges Landspar at Tango and The Ryogaku Bridge Riverbank , perspective is used to position some elements, while others are portrayed within the same picture as being within a depth- lessly flat space, their importance overriding any conformity to perspectivai rules.36 This mixture of techniques suggests that ukiyo-e art was not all about perceptual flatness, which in turn leads some to question Murakamis asser- tions.37 However, this mixture also gives some basis to Murakamis idea that '"Super flatness' is an original concept of Japanese who have been completely 140 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="13">Westernized."38 Moreover, ukiyo-e artists' methods of portraying depth in different ways and combining the perception of depth with depthless flat surfaces within the same composition suggest the potential for architectural explorations into dimensionality. SUPERFLflTNESS IN ARCHITECTURE The architectural implications of such a sensibility have not been ignored by Japanese architects, as they, too, grapple with the entwined legacy of Western modernity and Japanese traditions. As Igarashi Tarò relates, the current gen- eration of younger Japanese architects such as Aoki Jun, Sejima Kazuyo, and the founders of Atelier Bow-Wow (Kajima Momoyo and Tsukamoto Yoshi- haru) grew up with the first generation of manga such as the popular Astro Boy (1963-66, Tetsuwan Atomu ) and more recent anime such as Akira (1988) and Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995-96, Shinseiki evangerion).39 As Igarashi also argues, the Japanese urban landscape of repetitive, nonhierarchal elements strewn along roadsides has itself a sense of depthlessness; forms are blurred or superimposed over each other with no discernible order, until from the point of the observer, they form a continuous surface, obscuring the purpose and nature of any spaces behind. The resultant landscape has been described by the architect Ashihara Yoshinobu as an ameeba-toshi (amoeba city).40 Ele- ments are arrayed in a floating, almost isographic environment, where percep- tions of relative importance depend on the observers movement across the image. As Itõ Toyõ describes it, signs are transformed into space. Any "real" architecture is so covered in lights, signs, images, and other accretions that its formal qualities are hidden and, perceptually, only the surface remains.41 Design, as traditionally conceived in the West as form and spatial substance, is barely apparent, dissolved into a plethora of other competing stimuli. The connection between physical and cultural flatness can refer to a culturally spe- cific relationship between surface and skin, but also to the shift between the two- and the three-dimensional in architectural space, akin to the combining of isometric and Western perspective in ukie landscapes. One approach to planarity and flatness can be identified in the architec- ture of SANAA, the duo Sejima Kazuyo and Nishizawa Ryüe (Figure 4). Their 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa is in plan a perfect circle, within which are placed cubic, rectangular, and other circular spaces of different areas on a single plane (there is also a basement gallery). Each of these internal volumes is separated completely from the others. There is FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT J4)</page><page sequence="14">figure 4. 2lst Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. Left : Exterior view, look- ing at glass wall. Right : Interior view, looking at glass wall. Photographs by the author. no obvious hierarchy or sequential arrangement, either of volumes or of the spaces between them. From the outside what can be seen is a virtually unbro- ken curving glass plane, sitting within a flat park landscape. Any structure supporting this perimeter is hidden. Behind this glass wall can be seen the protruding cubic forms of some of the gallery spaces. These are also flat un- broken surfaces, this time white and opaque. Both inside and outside, there is no expression of structure, only the minimal articulation between planar sections. Like Murakami's art, this elimination of all but flat surfaces as the constituent parts of architecture posits space as an assemblage of planes. The focus of these buildings, the skins of which are essentially the wrapping around large multinationally branded boutiques, also alludes to the consum- erist aspects of Murakami's superflat art, where Japaneseness is not so much expressed as folded into an apparently globalized image. A number of recent buildings built for boutiques, including Itõ Toyõs Tod's and Mikimoto Buildings, and Aoki's Louis Vuitton stores in Tokyo's exclusive Aoyama district, are emblematic of a superflat approach to skin and content. Each of them treats the exterior surface as independent of the form and layout within. The Tod's store is clad with a skin of concrete and glass formed to suggest a tree in winter, with concrete elements tapering and diminishing toward the top of the building and wrapping around its L- shaped plan (Figure 5). In this flat treatment there is no articulation of the corners; like paper, the tapering two-dimensional forms merely fold around each corner. There is no reference to either the plan layout of the building or 142 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="15">figure 5. Tod's store, Aoyama, Tokyo. Left: Close-up view of exterior wall. Right : View of side and rear façades, showing corner. Photographs by the author. the expensive but rather bland products it contains. The building is its skin. Itõs Matsumoto Performing Arts Centre is formally quite different to the Kanazawa Museum but demonstrates a similar relationship between surface and space, and a similar subsumption of structure. Its treatment of surface and content is also analogous to the kimono, in that the building's material- ity is not entirely elided but concentrated into graphic techniques applied to its skin. The building's amoebic plan form is delineated by an exterior wall, which itself is punctuated by small blob-shaped areas of translucent, and oc- casionally transparent, glass (Figure 6, left). This forms a thin curved skin, as glass sections are flush-mounted both inside and outside to negate any sense of thickness. Perceptually, the wall is simply a screen-like surface, and from within, what is most apparent are blobs of light within blackness, rather than any structure. On the outside, the walls of the concert hall are lightly embossed with looping curvilinear patterns that, as the building has no external corners, seem to continue endlessly around it. Inside, the floors, ceilings, and balus- trades form distinct continuous surfaces; the joints between them are hidden, as is the structure, apart from a few thin white columns. Perceptual games are played, highlighting the way surfaces dominate the building's architectural expression. For instance, blob-shaped benches appear to cast a curiously pale shadow on the floor, but this is actually a color gradation dyed into the carpet (Figure 6, right). The overall effect is more like a computer rendering brought to life than a constructed space. FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT |43</page><page sequence="16">figure 6. Performing Arts Center, Matsumoto.

THE FUTURE OF THE ROBOT- THE ROBOT IN THE FUTURE The process started by the robot is continued with Jumsais Nation Newspaper headquarters, in a more abstracted (and literally flat) manner. Designed as the headquarters of the Nation Multimedia Group, the building shares with the Bank of Asia an anthropomorphic composition. Its overall form is described by the architect as being "like a 'head' with cut-outs for eyes' that peer over the road below."42 Compositionally, it is a vertical sandwich, with two flat fa- çades that are delineated with a graphic treatment derived from the architects idea of a "built painting." As a painting, the building alludes to a number of possible sources for its content: Other fleeting thoughts came at this point: "the profile of the chief editor working on a word processor, or perhaps a graphic artist working on a page layout, sitting on a stool; electronic circuitries surfacing here and there" as well as references to the robot and cubist painting.43 These buildings, while pointing toward the twenty-first century in ex- pressive terms, wrap their content in a manner calculated to flatten other meanings. In their design, the former Bank of Asia and the Nation Building selectively represent and project an image of a pan-Asian future. In portraying a cute, playful surface image, they are, in a way, pioneers of a forward-looking 144 DAVID BEYNON</page><page sequence="17">architecture that is both deliberately non- Western and nontraditional. They also key into the idea of the future as Asian, a notion that is already a well- used trope: When the architect Lee Ho-yin saw the sci-fi thriller Blade Runner in the mid-nineties, he was surprised about the film reviews that he read. "A gloomy vision of a big-city future" was the tenor of the American news- papers, because the film was set in dark alleyways between glittering sky- scrapers, crowds of people pushed past vegetable stands and collections of disembowelled electrical appliances, raindrops fell from leaky canvas covers, flickering neon lights bathed the passers-by in greenish-grey light. And Lee Ho-yin thought to himself. Future? Vision? This is the future and I am living in it. It is called Hong Kong.44 This broader cultural resonance connects with the dual notions of "Asian- ness" and modernity and how they can be represented within a country like Thailand. From being a Western construct, the notion of Asia is now widely used within the region to define attributes that are seen to be culturally em- bedded. Reference to "Asian values," especially by authoritarian governments in the region, is illustrative of this idea. In Recentering Globalization , Iwabuchi specifically discusses the exportation of Japanese technology and pop culture, but more broadly describes the late twentieth-century realization that Asia is no longer the passive recipient of globalized culture, but now rather actively produces and exports it.45 However, while this production of recentered cul- ture draws on shared characteristics, as Iwabuchi, Muecke, and Thomas argue; "what has become more prominent ... is the emergence of popular Asianism and Asian dialogues whose main feature is not Asian values or traditional culture but capitalist consumer/popular culture."46 In this, the dimensionality (arguably a culturally embedded way of seeing), the animism, and the pop- culture aspects of superflat art and architecture are combined. The overt use of cute imagery may wane, as suggested by the 2011 exhibition Bye Bye Kitty!!! and its associated lecture "Cordoning the Child, Killing the Kawaii." The in- tention here is explicitly to banish the specter of cuteness from Japanese contemporary art, and includes Nara Yoshitomo s photograph of Hello Kitty s gravestone.47 However, the interest in dimensionality (and within a Japanese context, the referencing of uki-e landscapes) remains, most notably in Ya- maguchi Akira s Narita International Airport : View of Flourishing South Wing , which applies intense detail to its architectural subject in floating isometric perspective.48 Perhaps the future of this combination will be a world like that FROM TECHNO-CUTE TO SUPERFLAT 145</page><page sequence="18">portrayed in the art of superflat artist Aoshima Chiho, integrating not only the endearingly anthropomorphic and the machinic but also the natural. In her computer generated cityscape image City Glow ; Aoshima brings Haraway s cyborgs to life as buildings with sweetly feminine faces, merging with an Ar- cadian landscape that has similar characteristics.49 Both graphically flat and luxuriantly alive, the continuum of human-building-landscape in the artwork is suggestive of a sensual, technological, and ecological future. The animist belief in the life force within all things is brought to its logical posthuman conclusion. Notes 1.
