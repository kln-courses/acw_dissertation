<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hermann Cohen and the Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism Robert Erlewine It should not be surprising that given the current political climate in both the international and domestic arenas that many scholars have turned their attention to the relationship of monotheism and intoler- ance.1 More specifically, the focus of such research is the apparent in- compatibility of the worldview more or less shared by the Abrahamic monotheisms and contemporary principles such as pluralism and toler- ance. While there have been some responses to these writings in defense of monotheism,2 my intention in this essay is to explore the position of perhaps the greatest thinker of liberal Judaism, Hermann Cohen, whose relevant Jewish works were produced almost a century before these cri- tiques (and defenses) of monotheism emerged. Cohen not only antici- pates the arguments of the critics of monotheism but provides a remark- able and unique solution that ameliorates the violence inherent in mono- theistic intolerance.3 1 The list of scholarly works on this topic includes the following. Jan Assmann's Moses the Egyptian (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard UP: 1997), and his even more impor- tant work Die Mosaische Unterscheidung: oder der Preis des Monotheismus (München: Carl Hanser Verlag, 2003), Martin S.

The existing scholarship has substantially dealt with issues such as Cohen's ethics, account of atonement, the religion of reason and its relationship to revelation, and his influence on later thinkers. How- ever, in that area in which Cohen's thought can perhaps most profit modern Jewish thought - and beyond that, philosophy of religion and theology for all three Abrahamic monotheistic religious traditions - the problem of monotheism and violence, scholarship has up to now by and large remained silent. In this essay I will argue that Cohen successfully dissolves the fateful link of monotheism and violence by rendering the intolerance inherent in the monotheistic worldview ethical. I will explore Cohen's solution by elucidating three inextricably connected correlations5 in his philosophy of Judaism, the correlation between God and human beings; the corre- lation between human beings themselves; and finally the correlation be- tween particularity and universality, which is embodied in the Jewish people. This last mentioned correlation provides the conditions for the emergence of the two previous mentioned correlations.

Terminology: Scriptural and Rational Universalisms Monotheistic intolerance towards the Other10 involves a tense and dy- namic relationship between particularism and universalism. This dialec- tic between particularity and universality is reflected in the operating logic of monotheistic religions, what I term 'scriptural universalism.' If we follow on the writings of Jan Assmann11 and especially Martin Jaf- fee,12 we can sketch out the following dialectical relationship of particu- larity and universality in the logic of scriptural universalism. In revela- tion, the one true God of the universe, i. e. the universal God, reveals himself13 and a set of doctrines containing universal significance to a particular community. These doctrines contain universal significance in that they reveal the universal human telos ordained by God and are therefore normative for all of humanity. The implication of this act of revelation is that a particular community alone grasps, and thus can fulfill, this universal human telos. All other peoples and communities, as a result of their lack of access (or full access) to this revealed knowl- edge, fail to live in accordance with this universal telos, and thus are estranged from the universal God.14 That is, according to the Abrahamic monotheistic worldview, a particular people is elected, and thus imbued 6 Hermann Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, Second Edi- tion, trans.

They are entrusted with a task to bring this knowledge of universal significance that was revealed to them in their particularity to the rest of the world. Until that happens, however, there is a tense relationship between those inside the elected community and those outside of it. Those outside the community are not simply the ones who live in ignorance without revelation but also the ones who willy- nilly oppose God by not living according to God's will, i. e. living in accord with the telos made manifest in revelation. During the Enlightenment (and Cohen is one of the last great cham- pions of the Enlightenment), many philosophers opposed a different logic to that of scriptural universalism, a logic I term 'rational univers- alism.' Rational universalism claims that its truths have the character of universality and necessity, like those of mathematics. Although many thinkers of the Enlightenment set up a radical dichotomy between ra- tional universalism and scriptural universalism, lionizing the former and devaluing the latter, some like Moses Mendelssohn and Cohen avoid setting up such a sharp disjunction between the two. Whereas it is a common critique that Mendelssohn's attempt at harmonizing the two logics founders, leaving his thought incoherent,15 Cohen succeeds in bringing these two universalisms together into a fruitful and dynamic relationship. Cohen argues that rational universalism, which begins as only a seed inherent in scriptural universalism, emerges and unfolds through the development of the scriptural literary tradition until it be- comes the dominant member in the relationship. It is precisely Cohen's ability to subordinate scriptural universalism to rational universalism while nevertheless preserving a viable relationship between the two that enables him to conceive of Abrahamic monotheisms in a totally new 15 The classical expressions of this criticism in Mendelssohn scholarship can be seen in Alexander Altmann's Moses Mendelssohn: A Biographical Study (London: Vallen- tine Mitchell &amp; Co.) 1973, 546-547, and his "Moses Mendelssohn's Concept of Juda- ism Reexamined," Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufklärung: Studien zur jü- dischen Geistesgeschichte, (Tübingen: J.

Cohen 's Methodology In order to understand Cohen's approach to Judaism it is essential to appreciate his Neo-Kantian methodology. Cohen, the founder of Mar- burg Neo-Kan tianism, is no slavish follower of Kant but rather feels free to innovate ways of interpreting Kant in order to solve certain problems with Kant's philosophical legacy and is willing to break with the master when he feels necessary. Cohen frequently utilizes elements in Kant's philosophy, often in original and unorthodox ways, to establish his own philosophical position, which profoundly opposes the Romantic turn in German idealism. Methodologically speaking, of particular im- portance for Cohen's thought is Kant's notion of the regulative ideal, where reason presents ideals that human knowledge strives to approx- imate but can never reach given that they exhibit a level of completeness impossible for the finite nature of human knowledge.16 The Kantian regulative ideal manifests itself in two essential respects in Cohen's methodology, the futurai, task-oriented account of knowledge and the notion of correlation. The first respect in which the regulative ideal manifests itself in Co- hen's thought is with his conception of knowledge, that knowledge is not a passive process but rather constitutes an activity of the mind. And, along the lines of scientific thought, knowledge is an ongoing pro- cess which perpetually corrects itself. Thus, rather than being the simple grasping of a datum, or of reaching a conclusion once and for all, knowl- edge constitutes an ideal for Cohen. In the words of Dieter Adelmann, "the 'Ideal' . . . does not constitute some form of the facts of the case in themselves [Sachverhalt für sich] against which one would oppose the thinking of 'reality', rather it is much more the task to idealize 'reality' [sondern vielmehr die Aufgabe, die 'Wirklichkeit' zu idealisieren.]"17 For Cohen, knowing is a perpetual task oriented towards the future, which alone possesses genuine being, not the present, which lacks stability.18 16 Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. Norman Kemp Smith (Boston: MacMillon and Co., 1929), 485 (A567-568/B595-596). 17 Dieter Adelmann, "Ursprüngliche Differenz: Zwischen Einzigkeit und Einheit im Denken von Hermann Cohen," Archivio di Filosofìa, vol. LXXI, (2003), 26. Note: be- cause of Cohen's frequent use of italics, I will not italicize every German word, but only those that Cohen himself italicizes.</page><page sequence="6">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 153 Second, the Kantian regulative ideal manifests itself in Cohen's no- tion of 'correlation.' Cohen explains that the correlation is: "Not an exchange [ Wechsel], but rather a preservation [Erhaltung] simultaneously of distinction [Sonderung] and unity [Vereinigung]. In the distinction unity is preserved, and in the unity distinction is preserved [In der Sonderung erhält sich die Vereinigung, und in der Vereinigung erhält sich die Sonde- rung]."19 That is, in a correlation two different terms are simultaneously held together and yet kept distinct. Each party of the correlation is changed and influenced by the other in the process of being held in orbit with it, even though each term remains distinct from the other.20 Since each term of the correlation (or at least one, when the correlation in- volves God),21 stands in an independent relation to a transcendent ideal, Cohen is able to preserve the significant difference between each term. The Correlation of Particularity and Universality in Judaism In Cohen's posthumously published magnum opus of Jewish thought, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, the methodology of correlation plays a central role. From the sources of Judaism, Cohen discerns three interwoven correlations, the result of which is the extirpa- 18 See Martin Kavka, Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy, 105; Robert Gibbs, "Hermann Cohen's Messianism: The History of the Future," in "Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums": Tradition und Ursprüngsdenken in Hermann Cohens Spätwerk. 334^335, 338-339, 341. 19 Cohen, Hermann.

Reprint of Second Edition (Hildesheim, Germany: Olms: 1914) 62; cited in Reiner Munk, "The Seifand the Other in Cohen's Ethics and Works on Religion," in Hermann Cohen 's Philosophy of Religion, 167. 20 Martin Kavka trenchantly remarks that with the correlation, "Cohen never uses the Hegelian language of sublating and dissolution (aufheben), but stays on its peri- meter in his use of the verb heben. In this movement of elevation towards the ideal, opposites flow into each other and interpenetrate, without dissolving and producing something new" (Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy, 105). 21 In his article "Ursprüngliche Differenz: Zwischen Einzigkeit und Einheit im Den- ken von Hermann Cohen," Dieter Adelmann helpfully elucidates the difference be- tween philosophical and religious thought, two related but distinct sorts of 'Denken.' Philosophy is concerned with "Einheit," which presupposes the "Unwandelbarkeit von allem ...; nämlich indem vorausgesetzt wird, dass es 'vom Denken in eine Einheit verwandelt' werden kann: d. i. die Instabilität von 'allem' bildet die elementare Voraus- setzung der Philosophie"(27) Hence, its preoccupation with the 'Ideal,' and the need of the future in its epistemological methodology. However, the '"Sein des Einzigen'; oder eben 'das einzige Sein'" i. e., God, exists in radical contrast to the 'All' in that it is fundamentally unchangeable (28). Thus, the full complexity of thinking involves "Den- ken zwischen Philosophie und Religion" (30).</page><page sequence="7">154 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 tion of the violence towards the Other inherent in monotheistic intoler- ance. The most prominent, and in a sense, most basic, of the three cor- relations is the one between God and human beings. Parasitic upon the correlation between God and human beings, is the correlation between human beings themselves. And finally, there is the correlation that is tied to the peculiar status of the people of Israel, the Jews. This is a correla- tion between particularity and universality. It is this particular people with their particular history that becomes universally significant by be- queathing to the world the previous two correlations, as well as perpe- tually bearing witness to them. That is, in the particular history of this people, or at least of their literary sources, Cohen argues that the emer- gence of these other two correlations is to be found. And it is in these correlations, which shape and are shaped by the history of the Jews, that Cohen is able to ameliorate the problematic violence surrounding mono- theistic intolerance. Cohen's critical idealism emerges immediately; it determines the man- ner of defining the topic of study in regard to Judaism, i. e. its literary sources. That is, rather than finding race, ethnicity, language, or even the actual history of the empirical Jewish people to be the essential founda- tion for his study, Cohen argues that it is the literary sources of Judaism that constitute the historical point of origin, the germ, which brings forth the correlation between God and human beings, as well as the concomitant correlation between human beings themselves. Cohen's method of reading the literary sources diverges sharply from the theolo- gical as well as historical.22 Cohen's hermeneutical method is a procedure of 'idealizing' the sources, i. e. he rationalizes them. In other words, in lieu of readings with dogmatic or historical emphases, Cohen looks for the text's highest possibilities according to reason.23 Nevertheless, history still plays a vital role in that "history, literary history, is the factor by virtue of which the actuality of Judaism comes to realization."24 That is, Cohen sees Jewish 22 However, rabbinic notions of interpretation have clearly influenced Cohen's no- tion of reason. This can be seen in the infinite, on-going nature of reason as a perpe- tual, interpretive enterprise similar to that of rabbinic understandings of the study of revealed texts. On this point see, Almut Sh. Bruckstein's "On Jewish Hermeneutics: Maimonides and Bachya as Vectors in Cohen's Philosophy of Origin," in Hermann Cohen's Philosophy of Religion, 36, 41, 43. Nevertheless, despite the important simila- rities between rabbinic methods of exegesis and Cohenian reason, methodologically, there remain considerable differences, in that ultimately, for Cohen, critical reason is privileged over any dogmatic claims to authoritative status of divine revelation. 23 Hermann Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 3-5.</page><page sequence="8">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 155 literary history as the medium in which concepts evolve and become more sophisticated and rational. For Cohen the correlation which animates Jewish literary sources and their history is between particularity, the particularity of the Jewish peo- ple, and universality, the universality of reason (it is a cornerstone of Cohen's thought that the idea of God is eminently rational). Thus, de- spite the fact that "literary sources are the immediate workings of a [particular] national spirit,"25 the universality of reason is nevertheless "able to wrestle its way into the history of the particular people."26 This correlation, which plays itself out in the literary history of Judaism, emerges quite early on in the Jewish literary sources themselves. In fact, the idea of the unique God is the primary origin, or Ursprung, of the national literature of the Jewish people. As a result, "[e] very thing that comes forth from the spirit of Israel comes forth just as much from the unique God as it does from the national spirit in its primary origin and peculiarity."27 Significantly, the two other correlations, that between God and the human being and that between human beings themselves, emerge in the process of this dialectical interplay taking place within the correlation of particularity and universality within Jew- ish literature. Cohen ultimately roots scriptural universalism in rational universal- ism, but refrains from effacing the particularities of scriptural univers- alism in the process.28 Rather than being impediments to rational uni- versality, the four moments constitutive of the "discursive structure" of monotheistic religions (revelation, election, historical mission, and the eschaton)29 play essential roles in the unveiling of rational universality itself. According to Cohen, the primary idea of revelation is the unique God, which in turn, entails the election of a particular community to promulgate this idea to the world as its historical mission, which when 24 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 3. 25 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 24. 26 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 8. 27 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 24. 28 In this sense, Cohen's Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism is sig- nificantly different than Kant's Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone, trans. Theodore M. Greene and Hoy te H. Hudson. (London: Harper Torchbooks, 1960). Kant can only envision a rational religion which undermines the particularities of all religious traditions, such that the traditions themselves, to the degree they are rationa- lized, become more and more homogenous, where differences are not genuine but merely superficial trappings. 29 In regards to the 'discursive structure' of Abrahamic monotheisms I am employ- ing the terminology and framework elaborated by Martin S. Jaffee in his essay, "One God, One Revelation, One People."</page><page sequence="9">156 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 complete will establish universal harmony throughout humanity. The rationality of this scheme is apparent in that the harmony secured in the eschaton provides a basis for conceptualizing the ideal of humanity, for the recognition of the inherent value of all human beings, which, according to Cohen, is a foundational concept in ethics proper.30 By privileging reason and rational universalism in his readings of scriptural texts, Cohen is able to trace out and secure ethical advance- ments within these documents, rather than reading them as if they are all of one piece, the typical manner of proceeding in scriptural universal- ism.31 The idea of the unique God, which is disclosed in revelation, already contains the germs of the other moments, including the escha- ton, with its recognition of the ideal of humanity. The ideal of humanity disclosed in the eschaton, however, conflicts with other moments of the discursive structure. Tension with the ideal of humanity emerges imme- diately with the structural moment of election, which remains a privile- ging of one group over others even if this elevation is only for the sake of promulgating the ideas of God and humanity to the rest of the world. As a result, Cohen finds in the Jewish sources a dialectical process, in which a harmony is slowly achieved between the ethical content con- tained within the idea of God on the one hand and the means by which this idea is to be brought to and established among the rest of the world on the other. Let us explore this process in a bit more depth. Although revelation arises with a particular people, who are then charged with the task of promulgating its message (election and historical mission), the actual content of revelation, once purified of its mythic dross, is a purely uni- versal notion of God, one inextricably bound to morality and the uni- versal idea of humanity. Revelation, then, is thoroughly rational, univer- sal, even though it initially appears in the national literature in mytho- logical forms of miraculous encounters with the divine.32 Thus rational universalism not scriptural universalism is foundational. This rationalist 30 On the idea of humanity in Cohen, especially its connection to the future, see Robert Gibbs's "Hermann Cohen's Messianismi The History of the Future," 334-335. 31 See for example, Daniel Boyarin's, Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994), 15-16. 32 For example, in Ethik des reinen Willens, (Berlin: Bruno Cassirer: 1907), 55, Co- hen chides his contemporaries for their fascination with the biographies of the prophets themselves. In particular, Cohen is distressed by his contemporaries' preoccupation with the accounts of the prophets' encounters with the divine, their becoming inhabited or possessed by the 'word of the Lord.' Cohen argues that the authors of these books are merely using the "device" of revelation, and in fact, the literal level of revelation, garnering such attention from his contemporaries, is, in fact, merely "a mythological</page><page sequence="10">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 157 grounding of scriptural universalism is essential, as by means of this Cohen creates the conditions through which bearing witness becomes comprehensible as a mode of promulgating the divine message. If revela- tion is ultimately rational, then even if its point of origin is with the literary history of the people of Israel, all human beings by virtue of their faculty of reason will be able to recognize its validity. Thus, bearing witness for Cohen is not an enterprise that ultimately defies human understanding because not only is the Other capable of recognizing the validity of the contents of revelation, but there is also no unfathomable mystery regarding the source of the mission to bear witness in the first place. Rather than resting disclosure or acceptance of the truth with the will of an unfathomable God, Cohen stresses human agency, the agency of the Jews in particular, to bear witness to the nations and convince them of the truth of the correlation between God and human beings (and the concomitant correlation between human beings). The relation- ship of the Other to revelation, then, is one of free assent or rejection based on their faculty of reason; there is no room for coercion based on divine commands that transcend the realm of human understanding. The correlation between God and human beings for Cohen, then, is rooted entirely in reason, which he claims is a concept in "common to God and man." This correlation, Cohen claims, involves a "reciprocal dependence" between God and human beings.33 God takes a direct role in rendering human beings themselves into infinite ethical tasks. The correlation between God and human beings thrusts the task-centered relationship between 'is' and 'ought' upon human beings. Human beings, as rational, ethical beings, are the "focal point" of creation, of existence, and are thus distinct from all other extant creatures.34 Cohen helpfully elucidates upon this with the idea of spirit, explaining that both God and human beings are spirit, however, not in such a way that their relationship is one of identity. When Cohen states, "spirit uni- tes both members of the correlation,"35 he means that human beings, as part of the process of becoming, receive their 'spirit' from God, who is being, the foundation of becoming. This derivation of spirit, however, is not a metaphysical relationship predicated upon some form of causality, concept." Cohen argues that if these books are read with sufficient rigor, the mythic and anthropomorphic device of revelation soon "shatters itself insofar as the reason of human beings is unified and reconciled [with the reason of] God." 33 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 88. 34 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 84. 35 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 89.</page><page sequence="11">158 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 but rather is rooted in teleology, in the purpose of human beings; the link is ethical. Cohen considers empirical human beings, human beings as they are 'given,' as corresponding to the 'is' in the relationship of 'is' and 'ought.' With Cohen's notion of holy spirit, we see that with the correlation between God and human beings, holiness, like spirit, binds God and human beings together, and yet it is distinct for each. Holiness is ineluc- tably tied to morality,36 and God's holiness exists solely for the sake of human beings. God's holiness is nothing other than the unity of the Maimonidean 'attributes of action,' which enables God to serve as an ethical model for the creation of the human Self.37 Rather than being content with the given self of the "empirical individual," God serves as the archetype for the Self which is "an ideal concept in ethics, defining a task assigned to man - a task which man has to commit himself inas- much as he strives for self-perfection in his effort to become an ethical person."38 God, as the moral archetype of the Self, is an infinite ethical task for human beings. If, in this correlation, human beings are enjoined to perpetually emu- late God, God, in turn, is conceived in strictly human terms, or to be more precise, God is conceived solely along the lines of human morality, which is the only sort of morality there is. This is what Cohen means in an earlier work, when he explains, "[t]he essence of God is and remains the essence of human morality [Das Wesen Gottes ist und bleibt das Wesen der menschlichen Sittlichkeit]."39 However, rather than comple- tely reducing God to a functionary of ethics in the manner of Kant, Cohen remains within the horizons of scriptural universalism by crafting his account of God in language of unknowability. "Outside of this inter- est in morality, the essence of God is unfathomable, that is, it is not an object of philosophical interest any more than it is of religious faith [Aus- serhalb dieses Interesses an der Sittlichkeit ist das Wesen Gottes uner- forschlich, d. h. nicht Gegenstand des philosophischen Interesses und eben- sowenig des religiösen Glaubens.]"40 God is perhaps not entirely reducible to morality, but as human beings, we cannot know God through any- thing but morality. 36 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 96. 37 While Cohen addresses this theme in both Religion und Sittlichkeit and Reli- gion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism he addresses this most explicitly in his work, Ethics of Maimonides. 38 Cohen, Ethics of Maimonides, 148. 39 Hermann Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 134. 40 Cohen, Hermann. "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 133.</page><page sequence="12">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 159 The result of this correlation is that morality and holiness, God and humanity, are thickly interwoven to such an extent that they are virtually inseparable even though they do not constitute an identity.41 God's holi- ness exists for humanity as a task, and thus human beings are the med- ium in which God's holiness becomes manifest. "God accomplishes his holiness in man."42 God's holiness is accomplished by means of human beings constructing (moral) Selves modeled upon God's moral attri- butes, which takes place through ethical action in the world.43 God's holiness, at least as it exists among human beings, is always a task, al- ways the moral ideal. Thus, "Man, in the infinity of his moral tasks, in the infinitely distant view of his horizon, man in his moral absoluteness, detached from all the relativity of nature and history, this absolute man becomes the carrier and guarantor of the holy spirit."44 In short, holi- ness is an ideal that demands to be realized, and yet, given the very fact that it is an ideal, it will never be realized fully. By means of this correla- tion with human beings, God and the moral order become synonymous, as God is the transcendental foundation of this moral order.45 And hu- man beings, as the partner in correlation with God, are the agents who are to bring about the realization of this order. Judaism and the Intolerance of the Moral Order According to Cohen, Israel's significance is not limited to giving birth to the idea of the unique God. Rather, the people of Israel, in all of their particularity, are to serve as the exemplar, the witness, to the universal idea of the unique God. This bearing witness constitutes at once the election and historical mission of the Jews. The Jews are elected insofar 41 In Autonomy and Jewish Philosophy, 170, Kenneth Seeskin explains that, "[a]s God is our creator, in Cohen's opinion, we, as it were, are God's discoverer. This does not mean that God is contingent but that given Cohen's idealism, the only way we can understand God is as a being in relation." 42 Cohen, Hermann.

Thus I clearly favor the interpretation of scholars such as Altmann, Schwarzschild, Holzhey, Seeskin, Wiedebach and Poma, over against Rosenzweig's influential interpretation of Cohen in the "Einleitung" of his Jüdisches Schriften, which proclaims that Cohen breaks with his neo-Kantian formalism in his posthumous work and becomes the fore- runner of Jewish existentialism.</page><page sequence="13">160 Rober t Erlewine JSQ 15 as they symbolize the universal idea of the unique God, and their mis- sion consists in bearing witness to it. Thus, the correlation between par- ticularity and universality in Israel continues. Cohen writes, "[w]ith re- gard to other peoples, therefore, Israel is not simply a people among a plurality of peoples. Because of its calling to profess the unique God and also to accomplish the historical work of the universal recognition of the unique God, Israel itself is distinguished as a unique people."46 The universal vocation of Israel secures its particularity. However, this dialectical correlation between particularity and uni- versality becomes complicated and contradictory in that "[o]nly knowl- edge of [the unique] God establishes a unified community of men."47 This claim raises two difficulties, one being highly significant. The less significant difficulty is that if the idea of the unique God translates into the idea of humanity as such, a united humanity with no divisions, then how can the Jews legitimately preserve their own distinct particularity? Is it not a contradiction for a particular people to embody universal humanity and yet remain distinct from all Others? Cohen deftly resolves this contradiction, because the world as it is remains fraught with dif- ference, humanity remains only an ideal that has not yet been accom- plished. Thus, the particularity of the Jews symbolizes the universality of humanity because this humanity is not yet, but remains a future goal, and the Jews are to serve as the witnesses in the present to a universal humanity that is to come.48 The second difficulty, however, gets at the heart of Cohen's enterprise. By claiming that 'only knowledge of the unique God,' of which the Jews are symbols, generates the ideal of humanity, an ideal essential to what he considers genuine or 'scientific-critical' ethics,49 Cohen decisively en- ters into the intolerant orbit of the discursive structure of the Abraha- mic monotheisms. Monotheisms understand themselves as not only en- trusted with a task of world-historical importance, and thus being uni- versally significant for all of humanity without exception, but also as possessing some sort of privileged knowledge about the human telos that other traditions lack. That is, there is an inherent religio-centrism within the self-conceptions of monotheistic religions, and thus, given 46 Cohen, Hermann.

While Cohen recognizes that intolerance is intrinsic to the monotheis- tic worldview, he nuances it by binding it up with a contradiction that arises between the Jews and the idea of humanity that needs to be worked out. On the one hand, with their idea of the unique God, the Jews bequeath to the world the correlation between God and human beings, which is inextricably linked to genuine morality, which not only possesses the universal idea of humanity - an idea that entails the re- cognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings, but it also pre- serves the difference between 'is' and 'ought.' Since the correlation be- tween God and human beings is an ideal task, the Jews, as the particu- lar, historical origin of this idea, are obligated by the logic of the idea itself, to embed this idea firmly in the empirical world, in history. To use monotheistic language, the Jews, in giving birth to this idea, are elected by its very logic, which demands that they embark upon a historical mission to bear witness to it. This logic gets more complicated in that in order to embed this idea in history, the Jews must radically oppose and negate other conceptions of the divine as idolatry and must work towards eliminating them. Cohen insists that monotheism absolutely "cannot permit any toler- ance of polytheism. Idolatry has to be destroyed absolutely."50 The dee- pest reason for this, Cohen claims, is that monotheism is firmly bound to the moral order, to the ideality of reality and especially, the ideal of humanity, whereas polytheism is bound up with the celebration of might and power, of existence as such, thus inhibiting morality on its most profound level. However, this moral rationale for the destruction of ido- latry creates the following contradiction. The mission of the Jews, to spread monotheism, which is inextricably bound up with the command to destroy idolatry, is simultaneously generated by the idea of the unique God while nevertheless being profoundly at odds with the inherent logic of this very same idea. In other words, the mission of the Jews which is done for the sake of the idea of the unique God seems to involve a conflict with the fruit of the idea of the unique God of monotheism, morality and the recognition of universal humanity. At least, this con- flict seems to exist insofar as monotheism demands the absolute destruc- tion of polytheism. To destroy polytheism, it seems, one must oppress and destroy idolaters, as people will not willingly abandon their culture and religions at the urgings of another. However, unlike Moses Mendels- 50 Cohen, Hermann. Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 52.</page><page sequence="15">162 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 sohn, who attempts to circumvent this contradiction by denying the very existence of polytheism, claiming that it is just culturally-coded mono- theism, or monotheism in a degraded form,51 Cohen remains true to the logic of monotheism insisting "[t]he plurality of gods should absolutely disappear from the earth."52 This means Cohen cannot avoid the most troubling form of this contradiction, those passages in the Hebrew Bible where the people of Israel are commanded by God to root out and destroy (i. e. kill) idolaters in one's midst, whether Jews or foreign peo- ples.53 Cohen finds his solution to this problematic issue in the Jewish lit- erary sources themselves, which he claims soon recognize that the radi- cal opposition to idolatry and polytheism is inconsistent with the idea of the unique God if it is construed as a call to violence against idolaters. Cohen argues that it is not coincidental that in the face of the demand to destroy idolatrous peoples, subsequent texts posit contrary claims com- manding love for the "Edomite" and even the "Egyptian." These texts testify to the humanity of the Edomite and Egyptian, insisting that ido- latry does not inexorably taint them or diminish their humanity.54 The significance of this development can hardly be overestimated, as it permeates Cohen's thought on Judaism. It is through this contradiction, Cohen claims, that the literary history of Judaism demonstrates that it is able "to correct its own teaching with respect to the strict command- ment to destroy idol worship and idolatrous peoples."55 In short, vio- lence against the idolater becomes absolutely prohibited as a solution to the problem of polytheism. As a result, while the Jews continue to insist that "[t]he unique God 'should be called Lord over all the earth,' and all men and all peoples should know and worship him," they eschew violence in carrying out their mission to bring about this state of affairs. That is, Cohen argues that the very superiority of monotheism over polytheism consists in morality and the ideal of humanity. As a result, the use of violence would undermine precisely what elevates monotheism over polytheism and would therefore contradict the inner logic of monotheism itself. Thus, Cohen's thought leaves us to ask, how are Jews to fulfill their historical mission without violence? That is, how, without violence, with- out dehumanizing the Other, are Jews to promulgate the ethical teach- 51 See Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, esp. 77-139. 52 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 243. 53 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 74. 54 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 120-121. 55 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 121.</page><page sequence="16">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 163 ings of the unique God in the face of idolatrous ideologies which cele- brate power and do not hesitate to use violence themselves? The answer to this question is to be found, Cohen argues, in a new correlation, one parasitic upon the correlation upon God and human beings, the correla- tion between human beings themselves. Judaism, Christianity, and Myth In order to understand how the correlation between God and human beings engenders the correlation between human beings themselves, one more step backwards is required. It is first necessary to understand that the ethical transfiguration of the idea of God that takes place in Cohen's correlation is itself competing with and replacing myth in its develop- ment. Myth is the primal layer of thought that exists prior to the devel- opment of critical reason. Cohen argues that myth must be overcome, even in monotheistic religions, in order for the ethical transfiguration of the idea of God, and subsequently, the correlation between human beings, to emerge. Cohen polemically uses Christianity to illustrate the dangers of monotheistic religions that have not overcome myth. The respective relationship to myth, Cohen claims, is the most pri- mordial and fundamental point of distinction between Judaism and Christianity regarding violence. Cohen claims that while Judaism decisi- vely breaks with myth by means of the correlation between God and human beings, Christianity remains beholden to myth, at least in certain capacities. A central defining feature of myth, according to Cohen, is that it maintains "an unmediated relationship between the human being and God [unmittlebares Verhältnis zwischen Mensch und Gott]."56 In myth, God exists as a person. In one sense, then, God is a person to whom one relates in a manner like any other. And yet, in another sense, God is a person like no other, in that God is all-powerful and all-know- ing, such that His57 will constitutes the good and the right. As a result, in mythic-worldviews, indeed even mythic-monotheisms, one encounters the Other mediated through one's personal relationship with the divine. This mediation restricts one to tribal or communal chauvinism insofar as the Other's recognition of the divine or lack thereof is all important in how one is to regard her. In such a system, maintaining good relations 56 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 134. 57 I intentionally use the masculine pronoun with regard to the mythic conception of God to stress that this conception is heavily anthropomorphized, and also because traditional mythic-monotheistic conceptions of God are almost overwhelmingly male.</page><page sequence="17">164 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 with the divine is far more important than ethical responsibility for the Other. It is God-the-person who arbitrates what is right and wrong, and the Other is either actively helping to realize God's plan or actively thwarting it, there is no in-between. God's honor and dignity is all con- suming, and thus human beings have no worth of their own except in- sofar as God bestows it upon them. As a result, sharp dichotomies divide communities, leading Cohen to conclude, "[w]ith the concept of humanity, myth has nothing in common."5* Cohen does not argue that Christianity is straightforwardly mythic, but claims that unlike Judaism, Christianity has not entirely broken with myth, leaving aspects of myth living on in it. The most striking mythical inheritance in Christianity can be found in its notion of God. Whereas Judaism conceives of God as maintaining purely ethical significance, as the ethical archetype of human beings, Cohen claims, for Christianity u[t]he God, who at the same time is human [Der Gott, der zugleich Mensch ist], is not only and not exclusively the archetype of human beings [nicht nur und nicht ausschliesslich das Vorbild des Menschen]. Therefore it is here the essence of God [Wesen Gottes] constitutes the peculiar content of faith [Inhalt des Glaubens]."59 That is, in sharp con- trast to Cohen's Maimonidean inflected Judaism that has no concern for God outside of God's ethical significance, this 'content of faith' pertains to an "extra-moral sphere [aussersittliche Sphäre]" that privi- leges dogmatic teachings over and above pure morality.60 This reliance upon dogma highlights that Christianity fails to subordinate scriptural universalism to rational universalism. In fact, for Christianity rational universalism is clearly subordinate to scriptural universalism, in that ethics, a sphere of human reason, is unable to establish autonomy, and thus elements of faith and dogma, which transcend the bounds of hu- man reason, are primary. Since scriptural universalism trumps rational universalism, and the 'extra-moral sphere' of faith trumps pure human morality, morality itself is now recast in terms of doctrinal and dogmatic knowledge. In privileging faith over morality and scriptural universalism over rational universalism, Christianity does not merely posit a radical cleft between the divine and the human, it also posits the radical superiority of the divine over the human. This, according to Cohen, has disastrous consequences for morality and intra-religious civility. Cohen writes: 58 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 139. 59 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 136. 60 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 137.</page><page sequence="18">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 165 This knowledge of divine essence, and . . . [this] determinate form and this unalterable content of knowledge of God is henceforth elevated to the pre- requisite for human morality [zur Grundbedingung der menschlichen Sittlich- keit erhoben]. And the more this knowledge of God feels itself to be at the same time love of God [Gottesliebe], regretfully, the more this becomes a struggle of faith [Glaubenskampf], the struggle for the knowledge and love of God. There is therefore a curtailment of love for human beings [Menschen- liebe], for humanity [Menschentums überhaupt] in general ...; for in no other way is morality conceived, much less realized, than as this way of knowledge of God, of faith in the essence of God and of divine salvation.61 From this perspective, the Christian's antagonism with the Other is the result neither of the need to assert her power over the Other nor neces- sarily to secure her own salvation. Rather, as nineteenth-century philo- sopher and theorist of religion, Ludwig Feuerbach points out, for the Christian qua mythical monotheist, in this conflict nothing less is at stake than the "honour of God."62 As Feuerbach claims, and here Co- hen would be in complete agreement, the Christian finds herself forced to choose between her duties to God and her duties to other human beings. Which duties are more important? The answer is clear. Accord- ing to Feuerbach, "[b]y how much God is higher than man, by so much higher are duties to God than duties toward man."63 As both Cohen and Feuerbach elucidate, in such worldviews duties to God almost al- ways conflict with duties to Others mainly because the Other simply cannot be recognized ethically without failing to recognize God. In contrast to mythical-monotheisms, the correlation between God and the human being, with its strictly ethical notion of God, causes a new and direct relationship to emerge between human beings. In "Reli- gion und Sittlichkeit," Cohen argues that for the prophets, whom he claims are the true creators of genuine monotheism (i. e. Judaism, and rationalized - i. e. 'Judaized' - forms of Christianity and Islam), rather than mediating all relationships, "God stepped back [trat zurück]" in order to purify the "relation between human being and human being [Verhältnis zwischen Mensch und Mensch]." That is, 'God stepped back' in order to make the concern for the other person more "ur- gent."64 If God remained some infinitely important person to whom one relates directly, as in myth, one's relationships to everything else including other human beings, would be drastically subordinated. Such 61 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit," 139. 62 Feuerbach, Ludwig, The Essence of Christianity, trans.

The correlation between human beings is a further development of the correlation between God and human beings. In order to understand the significance of this correlation we must briefly return to Cohen's discussions of myth. Mythic thought, which conceives of God as a per- son who is also the arbiter of the good and the right, is concerned with questions of causality, metaphysics and cosmology. Thus, when con- fronted with the Other, particularly the suffering of the Other, it asks questions of theodicy, and in order to justify God, it links this suffering inextricably to guilt, whether personal or inherited.65 At best, the suffer- ing of the Other is a theoretical problem, one that can be 'solved' through recourse to abstractions. One never encounters the Other in any sort of immediacy,66 particularly in regard to her suffering, but rather there is always room for ideological and conceptual frameworks to predispose one to indifference or hostility. Whereas Judaism nurtures the correlation between human beings, Cohen claims that Christianity remains beholden to myth. Christianity finds the suffering of human beings to be rooted in sin, and the release from suffering is tied to the Christological release from guilt. Since God has not been denuded of extra-moral essence, the relationship between the individual and God remains primary, and thus the pure interperso- nal relationship between human beings does not develop.67 As a result of this individualistic focus, the suffering of the Other can never become one's primary focus. In addition, Cohen claims that Christianity takes recourse to the mythical balms of the otherworld to ease the burden of guilt felt by witnessing the results of social suffering.68 Thus, given its mythic ties, Christianity serves as an obstacle to the correlation between human beings rather than a resource that supports it.69 Judaism, on the contrary, having broken thoroughly with myth, is conducive to the correlation between human beings. As a result, for 65 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 132-133. 66 By 'immediacy' I do not mean to suggest some sort of Levinasian encounter with the face, but rather, that the Other ceases to be an object of indifference and her suffering can be recognized for what it is, an offensive blight indicating the failure of culture and oneself for one's involvement in culture. 67 Cohen, "Religion und Sittlichkeit, 142-144. 68 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 214-215, 264. 69 It should be clear that Christianity serves as a heuristic device for Cohen, and while Cohen certainly maintains significant objections to Christianity he is not suffi- ciently 'objective,' (albeit with good historical and cultural reason) in evaluating Chris- tianity and the range and subtlety of Christian theology.</page><page sequence="20">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 167 Judaism the suffering of the Other is not a theoretical question where one looks to God for justification. The focus is practical not metaphy- sical, and thus one looks to humanity not God in the face of the ques- tion of human suffering. The suffering of the Other, particularly as it is objectively manifested in poverty, serves as a searing indictment of the failure to actualize the ideals of ethics. Those who suffer do not do so from their own guilt, nor do they suffer from death or other aspects pertaining to human finitude (which are ultimately metaphysical and individual in nature), but rather they suffer from the concrete failings of human beings to manifest ethical ideals.70 All of culture is indicted in poverty.71 It is precisely by means of taking the suffering of the Other seriously that the conditions emerge for the correlation between human beings. The suffering of the Other, objectified in poverty, not only reveals the failure of the culture to actualize ethical ideals, but moreover, it indicates one's own involvement in the culture's inhumanity, highlighting one's own failure to achieve one's ideal Self.72 From social suffering, an asym- metrical, non-reciprocal responsibility for the Other emerges, and this constitutes the basis of the correlation with the Other. With this correla- tion, one approaches the Other not in light of theoretical questions about the Other's possible guilt or other matters of theodicy, but rather with a responsibility that is accompanied by the affects of both personal guilt for one's own failures and for the failings of culture in which one is implicated and pity for the Other. Pity, for Cohen, is not a mere passive reaction, but rather is an active spur to moral responsibility, and it transforms the Other from a mere Nebenmensch (next-person), a He or She, to a Mitmensch (fellow-person), a Thou who faces one.73 The Mit- mensch is the center of the correlation between human beings; it is the condition for community in that it prevents all indifference and demands responsibility for the Other. It is the Thou, for whom one's relationship, one's responsibility, is rendered 'urgent.' Cohen states, "[t]his is the new insight that true monotheism brings about: the poor man is your own flesh. You do not consist of your own body, nor is your wife, the object 70 See Hartwig Wiedebach's, "Hermann Cohens Theorie des Mitleids," in Hermann Cohen's Philosophy of Religion, 235-236. 71 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 135. 72 Due to the limits of space, I am not able to go into the important contrast between Cohen's account of the notion of atonement in Judaism, which is thoroughly ethical and in accord with human autonomy as opposed to his account of the Christian notion. For a thorough account of the notion of atonement in Hermann Cohen's thought see Michael Zank, The Idea of Atonement in the Philosophy of Hermann Cohen. 73 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 138, 141.</page><page sequence="21">168 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 of your sexual love, the only flesh that is your flesh, but the poor man is also your flesh."74 A sentence later, Cohen continues, "And the [Mit- mensch] as the poor man brings God's love for man into the true light and the true understanding."75 The poor person/ Mitmensch reveals that the moral order, that what ought to be, remains to be enacted. God secures this moral order, and in the doctrine of Messianism, God serves as an assurance that morality will prevail in history. However, God is not therefore primarily to be taken as a comfort, but rather as the con- ditions for the ethical pursuit in general, and more directly, as the ideal. God's meaning is found in the ever-present demand to actualize one's ideal ethical Self. Bearing Witness and Reason The correlation between human beings, which Judaism enables to emerge, has significant implications for the correlation between the par- ticularity and universality of Israel. It affects this correlation regarding Israel in two interconnected ways, both of which enrich its complexity and further secure the extirpation of the violence implicit in monotheis- tic intolerance. The first way concerns the idealized Jewish homeland, while the second bears upon the role of the Jews in history. Together, these two interconnected influences inform the historical mission of the Jews to bear witness to the unique God of monotheism. The first level in which the correlation between human beings influ- ences the correlation between particularity and universality in Israel can be seen in the commands we discussed previously, to love the Edomite and the Egyptian. From the foundational notion of the unique God and its universality, Jewish literary works, particularly legal ones, extrapolate that it would be inconsistent for the universal God to love and care solely for the Jews, and thus, these works insist the contrary, that God must evince similar concerns and affections for all of humanity. Cohen reaches this conclusion by examining biblical laws and subsequent rab- binical laws which operate according to the ideal of a Jewish homeland. In these laws the Other is a foreigner, a stranger, which in biblical and rabbinic thought is inextricably bound up with the poor person. As a result, the Other is conceptually aligned with the poor person, who is approached with pity - understood as a lever to moral responsibility, 74 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 147-148. /D Cohen, Religion oj Reason Out oj the sources oj Judaism, 14».</page><page sequence="22">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 169 rather than with hatred or a feeling of superiority. Therefore the Other's rights are steadfastly maintained; even if she does not recognize the unique God the Other benefits from its conceptual fruits. Thus, a rigor- ous universalism is preserved within the particularity of the Jewish homeland. However, it is with the other side of the correlation that Cohen's real solution to the violence of monotheistic intolerance within the historical mission of Judaism becomes apparent. Whereas on the one hand, in Jewish law the humanity of the Other is recognized, on the other hand, in empirical history, Jews are the powerless ones whose rights and humanity are often not recognized by the Other. Cohen insists that the agony of statelessness, with the persecutions and endless suffer- ings that accompany it, are a necessary condition for Israel to play a universal role in world history.76 That is, on the opposite side of the correlation, Judaism as a particularity demonstrates its universality by serving as a symbol for the suffering of humanity, as the "prototype of human suffering in general" as the "social analogue of poverty."77 The election of Israel, as a particular people, does not entail it becoming a triumphant nation that conquers the Other, even if it is to bring them the truth. Rather, Israel suffers to draw attention to the unresolved so- cial suffering of the world, that what ought to be, is not, at least not yet.78 Thus, "God does not love Israel more or differently from his love for men in general, nor needless to say, could God's love for Israel limit and impair his love for the human race. In Israel, God loves noth- ing other than the human race."79 Cohen's ethical monotheism does not manifest an intolerance that entails or fosters any hostility towards the Other. In bearing witness, which maintains the intolerant differentiation between those within the community and those outside of it, the humanity of the Other is never effaced. In fact, the Jew opposes idolatry without effacing the Other's humanity by willingly taking on suffering, by serving as a "sacrificial victim who exposes himself to suffering because of his knowledge of the irreplaceable value of this suffering for the historical welfare of man- kind."80 The Jew, as the suffering servant, as the 'sacrificial victim,' who 76 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 252-253. 77 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 149. 78 For an excellent treatment of the notion of the suffering servant motif in Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism through the lens of the notion of the tragic hero in Cohen's Ästhetik des reinen Gefühls, see Hartwig Wiedebach's, "Hermann Co- hens Theorie des Mitleids," 231-244. 79 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 149. 80 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 286.</page><page sequence="23">170 Robert Erlewine JSQ 15 willingly reverses the trajectory of suffering in order to testify to the unique God, opens up the dimension of the future, an order radically different from all that has hitherto existed. By willingly accepting suffer- ing, the Jew discloses an "ethical conception of history" that refuses to recognize the equation of might with right.81 Bearing witness, for Cohen revolves entirely around responsibility for the Other. Or perhaps better, the love of the Other is a necessary result of the idea of the unique God, the idea to which the Jews bear witness. In addition, for Cohen, being obligated to God directly entails being responsible for the Other, such that there is no tension or divergence possible between these two roots of obligation. Thus, one serves God directly by bearing witness out of responsibility for the Other. Despite the fact that bearing witness involves the supererogatory, i. e. taking on the role of the suffering servant, Cohen claims this superer- ogation is a direct result of the rational universalism that inextricably links God to morality. The entirety of Cohen's account of Judaism is predicated upon the comprehensibility of bearing witness to human rea- son. The idea of the unique God is, in fact, the ultimate idea of reason. Therefore, the process of bearing witness to the Other is to be under- stood as a rational activity, as the Other has the faculties of understand- ing to grasp the idea of the unique God to which the Jews testify. It will be helpful to show how Cohen's rational reconstruction of Judaism and bearing witness elides the critique of monotheistic intoler- ance and violence, which pre-eminent critic of monotheistic violence, Jan Assmann, finds to be equally present even in martyrdom.82 In Die Mo- saische Unterscheidung, Assmann rejects the ethical potential of martyr- dom, claiming that monotheistic martyrdom is part and parcel of the same violent intolerance that leads to murder and persecution of the Other. He asserts that martyrdom, "as a refusal [Wiegerung], where one would rather die [lieber zu sterben] than accept forms of religion avowed false," is fundamentally tied to the problem of "monotheism and violence." Assmann argues that martyrdom is motivated by the same hatred of the Other as religious persecution. "It stands just as 81 Cohen, Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism, 265. 82 It is important to note that Assmann's work is not itself without critics. For a thorough and highly insightful critique of Assmann's methodology which problema- tizes the means in which he formulates the relationship of monotheism and intolerance, see Peter Schäfer's recent article, "Geschichte und Gedächtnisgeschichte: Jan Ass- manns 'Mosaische Unterscheidung'," Memoria - Wege jüdischen Erinnerns. Festschrift für Michael Brocke zum 65. Geburtstag, hrsg. Birgit E. Klein und Christiane E. Mül- ler.(Berlin: Metropol, 2005), 19-39.</page><page sequence="24">(2008) Humane Intolerance of Ethical Monotheism 171 much with that hatred [of the Other] [Ebenso steht es mit dem Hass]." That is, for Assmann, martyrdom is not so much about bearing witness to the truth for the sake of the Other as it is about refusal and rejection of the religion and culture (i. e., the otherness) o/the Other at all costs, even one's own life. Thus, since hatred of the Other permeates and mo- tivates martyrdom, according to Assman, it is really only a question of a differential of power whether one is to "go from the suffering [Erleiden] to the execution [Ausüben] of violence."83 The shift from suffering to persecuting for religion, Assmann claims, requires no qualitative change in religiosity, just an alteration regarding the direction of power.84 Assmann's critique fails to apply to Cohen, given that the two have a fundamental disagreement about the nature of revelation, concerning whether or not it contains any rational content. Since Assmann finds no rationality in revelation, stressing instead its radically transcendent nature, he finds only hatred of the Other in martyrdom. There is simply no medium in which the Other can grasp the content of revelation.85 Cohen, on the other hand, predicates his entire account of monotheism and revelation around rational universalism, which renders the content of revelation fundamentally accessible to the Other. Therefore his ac- count of bearing witness and martyrdom is immune to Assmann's cri- tique. Without Cohen's rationalist foundation, it is difficult to see how the willing martyrdom of Jews is not in some way bound up with the violence that haunts monotheistic intolerance. However, bearing witness for Cohen is predicated upon the assumption that the Other has some capacity to recognize the validity of the correlations between God and human beings and between human beings themselves, as well as the moral order and the ideal of humanity parasitic upon them. Thus the Jew suffers not because she has a privileged truth that the Other lacks and seeks to preserve her 'spiritual' advantage over the Other, but rather she suffers in order to draw the Other's attention to this truth, as the Other too can comprehend it and benefit from it. The Jew suffers in order to show the Other that her belief system is profoundly untrue and harmful to her herself, even if it provides her with power and worldly goods. 83 Assmann, Die Mosaische Unterscheidung, 35. 84 Jonathon Kirsch makes a great deal of this point in regard to the emergence of Christianity in the Roman empire.

Cohen secures the rational necessity and universal significance of the particu- larity of Israel by rendering Israel as the "symbol for the desired unity of mankind,"86 a unity whose fruition will not be achieved in actuality until the messianic era. By preserving this interchange between particularism and universalism, Cohen, unlike Kant, retains the dynamism of scriptur- al universalism. This retention of scriptural universalism also allows Cohen to account for Israel's need to preserve its radical particularity through the increase of ritual law, or Halakhah, under the rabbis, the 'building a fence around the Torah.' This process serves to isolate the Jews and thus preserve the purity of the idea of the unique God throughout the vicissitudes of history.87 However, Cohen's emphasis on the one-sided particularity of the Jews for the sake of universality is not absolute. Ultimately, national limita- tions are rendered superfluous, "and the 'people of Israel' becomes the 'remnant of Israel.'"88 With this move, Cohen fulfills the logic of his task-oriented ethics and notion of religion. Cohen's account of Judaism also presents the structural moments of election and historical mission as perpetual tasks of infinite responsibility for the Other as well as for the Jew. As a result of this shift to the 'remnant of Israel,' not only are not all members of the empirical community of Israel part of this ideal, but membership is opened to those who are not empirically Jewish. Judaism has long recognized the 'pious of the nations of the world,' as possessing religious status in Judaism, and as 'honorary Jews,' it is now recognized that they too "have their fully entitled share in this messianic suffering."89 Conclusion Given the world-wide political crisis caused at least in part by tensions between religions, especially monotheistic ones, it is imperative that we reexamine the legacy of Hermann Cohen.

Cohen's thought presents a powerful alternative to particularistic understandings of Juda- ism, and the force and tenability of it has not waned in the century since he wrote. 90 See the concluding chapter of Kenneth Seeskin's Jewish Philosophy in a Secular Age (Albany: State U of NY P: 1990), titled "Universality and Particularity," 213-226, which discusses the tensions between these two tendencies in Jewish thought through- out its history, and laments the current predominance of particularism.</page></plain_text>
