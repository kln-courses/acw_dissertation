The dipole compo- nent (represented by the bar magnet in the core of the Earth) is much greater than the non-dipole component (not shown). The field due to the magnetic dipole in the core is represented by field lines, which come closer together as the intensity and inclination of the field increase systematically between the magnetic equator and the magnetic poles.

The total field vector can be resolved into components (arrows) in the X (north), Y (east) and Z (vertical) axes.
