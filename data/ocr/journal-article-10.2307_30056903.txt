<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM' R. PERRIN2 AND M. ROUBAULT3 ABSTRACT Anomalies in the order of crystallization, the inadequacy of hypothetical aqueous residual and "pore" liquids, the complexities and inconsistencies of the theories of differentiation, the insuperable problem of granite emplacement (the "space problem"), the problem of the gneissic zones and the gradation of gneiss into granite, are all taken as evidence that the theory that granite is a product of crystallization of a magma is inadequate. Evidence that granite originated by diffusion and reaction in the solid state is presented. Supporting this concept are the observed feldspathization of inclusions and country rock, double and reciprocal inclusions, digestion of transgressive dikes by the host rock, failure of "stoped" blocks to settle, microscopic evidence of replacement and corrosion, and the incomplete or arrested state of alteration of inclusions. The eruptive character of granite dikes is an anthropomorphic or subjective impression. Conclusive evi- dence that some dikes are replacement phenomena is presented. Though some authors admit granite to be polygenetic, it seems more probable that such a singular rock should be of one mode of origin, namely, diffusion and metasomatism in the solid state. INTRODUCTION The granite problem is again in the limelight. For many years the magmatic origin of granite was accepted without dissent; but now this dogma is being questioned by "metamorphists." There is vigorous defense by the "magmatists" against what Niggli (1942, p. 17) has called a revival of the "Universal The- ory" without any new evidence or argu- ment in support of it. In the past few years several authors have considered this problem. We appear to have been the first (i937, 1939), followed by Niggli (1942), Reinhard (1943), Read (1943- 1944), and Raguin (1946). In the latest edition of Eruptive Rocks, Shand (i947) also presents a number of arguments for the classical theories.4 In this discussion we seem to represent the most liberal element, with Read fol- lowing closely, whereas Reinhard, Raguin, * Manuscript received September 27, 1948. 2 Administrateur-Directeur General de la Soci6t6 d'Electrochimie, d'~Electro-m6tallurgie et des Acieries electriques d'Ugine (Savoie-Alpes). 3 Professeur, Universit6 de Nancy, France. 4 Just after this article was completed, we re- ceived Memoir 28 of the Geological Society of and especially Niggli, support the more conservative views. Most petrographers in their writings have chosen one or the other theory. Some, on the other hand, (as, for example, Reinhard), have ad- mitted that granite may be polygenetic. The discussion has become more and more heated, and occasionally personal. P. Niggli (1942, p. 15) is particularly severe with R. W. van Bemmelen, who was the first to give full support to our ideas. Niggli makes no reference to our publications and therefore does not di- rectly discuss our arguments. Neverthe- less, he asserts that reactions in the solid state obtained in the laboratory are of little importance. He asks how the "ema- nations" were observed in the field and under the microscope, and why they rise. Finally, he asks what mysterious force tends to transform the sediments into a final product which is always the same, granite or granodiorite. In a memoir which is itself not free of America, "Origin of Granite" (conference at meeting of the Geological Society of America held in Ottawa, Canada, December 30, I947). Our com- ments on this important work are appended at the close of this paper (p. 376). 357</page><page sequence="2">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT contradictions, Max Reinhard (1943, p. 34) is clearly disdainful of "a few un- pleasing phenomena" (einige unerfreu- liche Erscheinungen). He concludes, after praising Niggli: "Je geringeres Gewicht man ihnen beimist, desto weniger werden sie die notwendigen Auseinandersel- zungen fiber das Problem der Granit- bildung belasten." On the other hand, Shand, though a "magmatist," does not agree with him, writing us recently: "Your contribution to the study is a most important one, and it will teach all of us to observe more closely and think more clearly." More recently Barth (1939; 1947, p. 181) cited our works in terms whose courtesy we thoroughly ap- preciate. The importance of reactions in the solid state and their role in granitization are viewed in completely contrary ways. However, these contradictory judgments so positively expressed do not lessen the general impression derived from reading the works of contemporary petrogra- phers, that most of them are obviously disturbed by the facts disclosed and the deductions drawn from them. However, many are evidently still influenced by the "magmatist" ideas that were taught them or which they themselves are teach- ing. Diffusion and reactions in the solid state are unfamiliar to most petrogra- phers. On the other hand, the prevailing concepts of magmatic differentiation ap- pear consistent with data presented in the solidification diagrams. The classical hypothesis about the influence of water, "pneumatolysis," etc., taught as a syn- thetic, apparently coherent, construc- tion, looks like a scientific certainty. For this reason it is necessary to review the whole question and to outline, very briefly, the hypotheses on which the magmatic theories rest. THE "MAGMATIST" HYPOTHESES SEQUENCES AND ORDERS OF CRYSTALLIZATION Rosenbusch has stated what is still considered the normal order of crystalli- zation of elements of eruptive rocks and, consequently, of granite. Accord- ing to him, the first to crystallize and therefore the first to be deposited in the theory of solidification of granitic magmas are zircon, apatite, rutile, and sphene. All these are uncommon con- stituents of rocks and therefore of the original mixture. The early crystalliza- tion of rare constituents is inconsistent with what is known of melts in general: rare constituents crystallize from a solu- tion only if there is a break in miscibility. However, zircon (zirconium silicate) and rutile (titanium oxide) are quite miscible in silicate melts and can be used in large quantities in metallurgical slags (whose nature is like that of rocks). This fact, in itself, is rather disturbing After the so-called "accessory" min- erals just referred to, there should appear orthosilicates with biotite, metasilicates, calcoalkalic feldspars, and, lastly, silica. Therefore, the deposition of potash oc- curs first during the forflation of biotite, is interrupted by crystallization of the plagioclases, and is resumed during the crystallization of orthoclase or micro- cline. Such an interruption of deposition of an element in this way is contrary to what is known about crystallizing solu- tions. A much more striking example of the interruption in deposition of a substance is that of water. During the crystalliza- tion of the magma, water appears as a constituent in early-formed minerals- biotite and, in many cases, hornblende, It is absent from the plagioclases, ortho- clase, and quartz but reappears, at least theoretically, with the residual solutions 358</page><page sequence="3">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM (rest Lsungen) of Niggli. However, this water is rarely found in any mineral formed from such solutions. An inter- ruption of deposition of this type is ab- normal and even improbable. S. J. Shand has noted this anomaly (i944). In a granitic magma (one with an ex- cess of silica) it is not the silica that is thought to be deposited first. However, in the known silicate melts with an ex- cess of silica, the silica is deposited first. How does one explain this anomaly? The usual concept is that water is in some way responsible. Assuming this and granting even the most improbable sin- gularities, observation shows that, even from magmas of almost identical com- positions, the order of crystallization may not be the same. We have cited (1939, p. 60) some of the numerous ex- ceptions to Rosenbusch's rule. Shand, in the third edition of Eruptive Rocks, wrote: The only conclusion that we can draw from the foregoing discussion is that there is no such thing as a constant order of crystallization, applicable to all magmas or even to one magma under different physical conditions. The Rosen- busch rule has no theoretical or experimental justification, and even on the basis of observa- tion it cannot be upheld. Yet the strange fact remains that the rule seems to be applicable to a large number of rocks. How can this be? What hypothesis, then, can we formu- late which will reconcile with physical laws of solidification these two numer- ous exceptions to the rule? Must we con- sider, as Niggli did, some mysterious "automorphoses" by the residual solu- tions of the magma? It would fail to ex- plain the deposition of hornblende or olivine last in granites, a fact which led Sederholm (1923-1926) to the hypothesis of an ultra-basic residual magma, which is quite out of harmony with the general rule. The formation of zoned feldspars with a sodic center or with alternating zones is not the least of the peculiarities of the crystallization of magmas. Several au- thors, including Phemister, Hil's, and Hibsch (Perrin and Roubault, 1939, pp. 63-65) have attempted to explain it. Norman L. Bowen, author of the anor- thite-albite diagram, postulated a veri- table dance of the feldspars in incomplete decantation in zones of magma with dif- ferent temperatures (1928, p. 275). How- ever, such an imaginative and unfounded hypothesis is inapplicable in the ob- served case of so-called "inverse zona- tion" (labradorite in the center and anorthite at the periphery), which is in absolute contradiction to the experi- mental diagram established by Bowen himself. THE ROLE OF WATER AND RESIDUAL SOLUTIONS Leaving out of consideration the water of quartz inclusions or of minerals such as mica, it is generally believed that water (or at least hydrogen) is necessary for the formation of granite (Perrin and Rou- bault, 1939, pp. 123-124). A considerable quantity is needed to explain the rela- tively low temperature of granite forma- tion (in agreement with Goranson's ex- perimental results). This water must dis- appear without producing the slightest distortion of the rocks by volume changes. Granite must have lost its water, de- spite the very high pressures and relative impermeability of the rocks overlying the magmatic reservoir. On the other hand, lavas of the same composition arrive at the surface with 8 per cent water, which they retain, so that they solidify practi- cally "saturated" with water (if Goran- son's experiments are a valid guide to the solubility of water in lava). Water plays a no less mysterious part 359</page><page sequence="4">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT in the explanation of the "palingenesis" of solidified granites, i.e., those trans- formed on the spot, according to Seder- holm, into new granites. These granites, having solidified and therefore lost their water, must now reabsorb water to ac- count for their remelting at a necessarily low temperature. Every palingenetic stage requires the entrance and loss of water, again without leaving any evi- dence of deformation The introduction of water quickly fol- lowed by its disappearance, which is needed to explain the lowered melting point of granite, is even more necessary to account for "residual" pegmatites, which, according to theory, were liquid at still lower temperatures What light do Goranson's experiments with alkaline quartz-feldspar mixtures shed on this question? Pegmatites should present few- er difficulties than the fusion of granite because both temperature and pressure were much lower. J. G. Koenigsberger (1942, p. 89) has given us the answer: Goranson's experiments have failed to prove anything in that respect. What happens, then, to the theory of pneuma- tolitic sequences and the older hypothe- sis? But let us return to the subject of the residual liquids. These solutions are re- garded as powerful agents of impregna- tion and transformation of the enclosing rocks (Niggli, 1942, p. 34). How, then, account for the extreme irregularity of metamorphism about granite bodies? In cases where it is almost nonexistent (Roubault, 1935, p. 21), must we assume the absence of pneumatolitic and hydro- thermal stages? These same residual fluids with their great impregnating power also have an equally important dissolving power over previously deposited minerals (Niggli, 1942, p. 21). This hypothesis championed by Niggli has been rightly attacked by several authors, including Bowen and Barth, who have shown that a residual liquid cannot dissolve previously formed crystals-it can only transform them into crystals with which it is in equilib- rium. It is an observed fact that pegmatite veins take on forms implying "corrosion" of enclosing rocks containing hornblende or biotite (early-formed crystals which ought not to dissolve), which makes it necessary to reaffirm the dissolving pow- er of the liquid. Niggli invokes the "reac- tion principle" (1942, p. 21), which, how- ever, does not permit a biotite or a mus- covite granite to dissolve pyroxene or hornblende because of the antecedent position of these minerals in the reaction series. Such granite is "saturated" with respect to these minerals. Production of such crystals by the assimilation of sedi- mentary rocks is also not permissible. Eskola (1939, p. 379) writes that, in the light of Bowen's reaction principle, the granitization of limestone is generally rather unlikely. Yet the transformation of limestones by granitic endomorphism into real diorites is a widely known phe- nomenon, as Lacroix (1899) showed in his classic memoir on the granite of the Massif de Querigut in the Pyrenees. What new hypothesis should be formu- lated to explain this granitic endomor- phism? DIFFERENTIATION The only scientific and logical theory published to explain the genesis of the so-called "differentiated" rocks from magmas is that of Bowen (1928). It is based on gravitative settling of heavy minerals, especially ferromagnesian, dur- ing the crystallization of the magma, and also upon a "squeezing-out" or filter- press action which separates the liquid parts from the already formed crystals. 360</page><page sequence="5">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM Bowen's idea rests on an experimental basis. Niggli (1942, p. 71) believes that the criticisms of Bowen's theory are un- justified because they are concerned with the letter of the theory He amended it in his theory of the "complex gravitation crystallization differentiation" (komplexe Gravitation Kristallization Differentia- tion), according to which the first-formed crystals descend into warmer zones and redissolve, thus serving as vehicles for the transport of molecules. To this are added equalizing movements (A us- gleichwanderungen) and separations (Ab- quetschungen) by pressure. In like man- ner, according to Niggli, the assimilation is chiefly accomplished by the sinking of most of the blocks separated by "mag- matic stoping." Niggli adds that we must explain not only how differentiation comes about but also how it leads to the formation of different, separated, partial magmas which are comparatively homo- geneous in themselves. The mechanisms postulated by Niggli lead us to expect complete gradation between magmas and the rocks formed from them, but Niggli thinks that these mechanisms surely lead to relatively homogeneous partial mag- mas. He does not give reasons for this "surely," which, to us, seems hazardous. But in some so-called "differentiated sys- tems," basic rocks overlie acid, which is contrary to theory and also to gravity. To interpret the relations on the basis of differentiation calls for new hypotheses involving squeezing, filter-pressing, or some other mechanism. In some places anorthosites overlie heavier gabbros (Nordingra-Gebiet in Sweden; Barth, 1939, P. 95), which is to be expected un- der the differentiation theory, but else- where, as in the Adirondacks, the gab- bros overlie anorthosites. The formation of alkaline rocks (Barth, 1939, p. 91), the zoned rocks, such as the banded gabbros of Duluth, and the al- ternating zones of lherzolite and ariegite of the Pyrenees (Lacroix, 1899) offer spe- cial difficulties for the theories of mag- matic differentiation. N. L. Bowen and Robert Balk have both offered hypothe- ses, but neither seems to us to be satis- factory. At what point are we to stop? Let us repeat what Niggli has correctly said, that not only the differentiation but also the comparative homogeneity of the parts must be explained. The last case mentioned above is a good example of the problem to be solved by the "magma- tists." Why not also attempt to explain the banded crystalline gneisses? Lest it be said that we exaggerate, let us point out that it is actually by differentiation followed by alpine dynamometamor- phism that Casasopra (1939) explains the formation of certain gneisses of the Le- ventina Valley in Switzerland. These are identified by analysis as orthogneisses and also display very fine regular alterna- ation of thin gneissic zones of various compositions. THE EMPLACEMENT OF GRANITE Although many "magmatists" regard assimilation of already existing rocks as of great importance, Niggli, carried along by the inflexible logic of his theories (which allow granite very weak assimila- tive powers), is led to regard most gran- ites as the products of juvenile magmas. However, being fully aware of the diffi- culty of introducing such magmas into already prepared openings (1942, p. 56), he seems to adopt Eskola's ideas of par- tial anatexis. In addition, he postulates subsidence of blocks detached by mag- matic stoping. More and more authors assign a large role to assimilation, but Bowen himself acknowledges that gran- itic magmas are incapable of large-scale 361</page><page sequence="6">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT assimilation, and Raguin (1946, p. 194) says: "One would be tempted to invoke other, unknown, factors" ("On serait tent6 d'invoquer d'autres facteurs in- connus"). The older work of the French school (Auguste Michel-L6vy, A. Lacroix, and Charles Barrois), together with that of Bucking and of more recent authors, such as Holmes and Reynolds (1947), have shown that in many cases the mise en place of so-called "eruptive granites" has taken place d l'emporte pieces without disturbing the sedimentary strata. In some cases traces of these strata have been found in exactly the position indi- cated by extension of the beds, either in the original form or as endomorphic modifications of the granite. What hy- pothesis will account for these relicts re- maining in exact alignment within what was an eruptive liquid granite? These ob- servations are of fundamental impor- tance and are inconsistent with the "magmatists' " theory. Besides, the en- domorphic parts of the granite are in many cases diorites or still more basic rocks. Theoretically, these rocks belong- ing to the eruptive rock facies went through a liquid stage, although, being anhydrous in the theory of differentia- tion, their melting point is much higher than that of watery granite. What new hypothesis must we create to explain this complete contradiction? Another important point to which we shall refer later but which should be kept in mind has to do with the so-called "stoped" blocks. The theory of crystal- lization differentiation requires that crys- tals of chrysolite, pyroxene, hornblende, etc., the first to be formed in the solidifi- cation process, be decanted by gravity. However, Stokes's law demands that, with equal density and similar shapes, the rate of sinking should increase even faster than the increase in size of bodies. To explain the sinking of small crystals in a case where large or even great bodies located far within a granite mass (as in the Bergell area) have not descended may require another hypothesis. Only if the granite had a practically infinite vis- cosity-the viscosity of solids-can these observations be explained. Related to the problem of granite em- placement is the emplacement of ultra- basic rocks: dunites, peridotites, and lherzolites, whose melting temperature at atmospheric pressure is very high (1,6oo°-I,8o00 C.). Here, too, hypotheses have been offered. However, Barth, who considered the matter at great length, unhesitatingly concluded that the prob- lem is still far from solved (1939, p. 96). ZONES OF ANATEXIS5 The emplacement phenomena briefly discussed above are more especially re- lated to "eruptive" granites which clear- ly cut across country rock. It appears de- sirable to summarize some "magmatist" theories arising from the study of zones of anatexis. It is not easy to understand the strict "magmatist's" theories of origin of the zones subjected to the action of Seder- holm's ichor. The theories appear, in es- sence, to depend on the action of "residu- al pegmatitic solutions" capable of pass- ing through all rocks, plus partial refu- sion-Holmquist's ultra-metamorphism and Eskola's partial anatexis imply such a selective fusion of the granitic ele- ments, always with the aid of water. These theories are contrary to Weg- mann's theory of transformations with- out fusion, by means of intergranular films. Eskola, however, seems to consider migmatization a sort of metasomatosis, but with the magma itself responsible s Including the "metatekt" zones of Scheumann. 362</page><page sequence="7">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM ("das Magma selbst als Triger fun- giert") (1939, p. 378). This refusion, thus admitted, leads to a new hypothesis: Most of the rocks may have gone through a molten stage without disturbance of the sedimentary laminations and the folding of the original layers (outlined mainly by residual micas). (It is these observations which led Wegmann-quite rightly in our opinion-to reject the presence of magmas in these zones.) It is common knowledge that rocks which have always been considered mag- matic (such as pegmatites or aplites) have been observed in "metatekt" zones, or even in higher metamorphic facies. They commonly occur as isolated masses, clouds, trainees diffuses ("schlieren"), veins, or veinlike bodies, without being visibly related to a deep-seated mass and without any possibility of injection. It is difficult to explain that isolation of rocks which supposedly formed from magmas at the end of "liquation." A new hypoth- esis-Ausbliitung, or exudation-came from the ideas of ultra-metamorphism. Niggli (1942, P. 33), after quoting from the words of Holmquist, Scheumann, and others, imagines a "molecular dispersion phase" (molekulardispersen Phase), whose migration would mean a partial remelt- ing of the rocks, accompanied by concen- tration of some of the constituents ("Das Einspritzen ist oft nur ein Sammeln und ein Wandern"). It is also noteworthy that Koenigsberger (1942, p. 89), who col- laborated with Niggli, considered the formation of anatexic pegmatites from exudations impossible. It is necessary to devise still another hypothesis to explain already formed cavities of extraordinary shapes in which the "exudation" products crystallized. Many of these are filled with feldspars only, and, as the feldspars are anhydrous and therefore have a high melting point, an explanation should be (but is not) forthcoming. In addition, what explana- tion is there of clays containing 5 per cent alkalies (Roubault, 1935, p. 253) found in contact with granite but without exu- dates? Likewise, how explain masses, veins, "schlieren," etc., filled with soda- lime feldspars and even ferromagnesian minerals (hornblende, micas, etc.) which are theoretically crystallized first and are not a part of the "light, liquid, portion" (leicht fliissiger Rest und Teile), gabbro pegmatite observed by A. Lacroix au Pallet, or pegmatites of nepheline syenite reported by Barth (1939, p. 97)? Indeed, the composition of such rocks bears no re- lation to theoretical "residual" solutions, Therefore, generally speaking, the classi- cal theories concerning the water of granites of the "anatexic zones" and of pegmatites leads to a law: The less hy- drated minerals a rock contains, the more water it has contained. This really dem- onstrates objectivity in adapting theories to observations! CONTINUOUS GRADATION OF GRANITE TO GNEISS This is, again, an old subject of discus- sion. H. H. Read (1944, p. 51), after not- ing Elie de Beaumont's opinion that the origins of granites, gneisses, and mica schists are related, adds (p. 52): "This profound statement has been forgotten by many a thoroughgoing magmatist. For example, Niggli [1942, p. 7] believes that the association of granite and gneiss complicates the granite problem. For some of us, on the other hand, this asso- ciation may clarify the problem." Niggli says: "It is obvious that these passages can be interpreted in two ways: the prox- imity of the granitic magma has created favorable conditions for an 'ultrameta- morphosis,' or the magma is but the end product of the 'ultrametamorphosis' " 363</page><page sequence="8">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT ("Es ist selbstverstandlich, dass sich diese tbergange zweifach deuten lassen: Die Nahe des granitischen Magmas schuf die ffir eine Ultrametamorphose giinstigen Bedingungen order das grani- tische Magma ist nur das Endresultat der Ultrametamorphose"). The hypothesis of convergence of structure and of composition between solid rocks which have been metamor- phosed (even if they have been partially melted) and rocks which have crystal- lized from a melted magma remains to be considered. Niggli makes no reference to the zones of completely chaotic mixtures of granites and gneisses of similar compo- sition which are well known to petrog- raphers. How can one conceive of some of them having been completely melted while others were not, when the points were so close that the temperature was necessarily the same? Evidence has apparently recently compelled Niggli (1947, p. 153) to make some concessions to the "metamor- phists" by distinguishing not only "mag- magranites" and "ultra-metagranites" but also "metagranites" resulting from metamorphism without any fusion what- ever. He thus presents the hypothesis of convergence. In short, the "magmatists" have gradually built up a whole series of hy- potheses (we have listed over twenty, and there are many others) which they require to explain the facts. But when a concept needs such a concourse of hy- potheses to support it (many of which are in opposition to one another), we can properly conclude that, however pleasant the structure may be to the eye, the foundation is weak. Moreover, as we have seen above, this accumulation of hypotheses leads the "magmatists" to postulate several differ- ent geneses for granite, the choice de- pending on the requirements of the case. Reinhard, like Niggli, admits of three- a priori, this fact alone should have brought doubts to the minds of these authors, for granite is so special a rock that it seems unreasonable even to con- sider the possibility of convergence. It is difficult for us to imagine that such a crystallization did not in every case sup- pose an environment of the same nature: solid or liquid-one or the other, but not both.6 No doubt we shall be told that we also venture a number of hypotheses, perhaps still weaker, in our theory of granitiza- tion in the solid state. Nevertheless, in the following section we shall endeavor to show that our theories are based on in- disputable observational data. EVIDENCE OF ORIGIN OF GRANITE BY DIFFUSION AND REACTIONS IN THE SOLID STATE GENERAL REMARKS The belief in magmatic granite began with Hutton's (the father of the plutoni- an school) observations of the eruptive aspect of some granites, their homogenei- ty, and their apophyses and veins. The differentiation-crystallization theory added in recent years only supports the conclusions derived from Hutton's origi- nal observations. Thus the belief in melted granite arises, first of all, from a subjective im- pression. "Anthropomorphic" was the term used by Maillet and Pavans de Ceccaty (1937) to characterize a similar attitude in tectonics. These authors wrote further: "Tectonics is not the only discipline in which the sensory imagina- tion should be neglected" ("La tecto- nique n'est pas la seule discipline oif 6 "Solid" is extended to include rocks previously discharged (epanches) in the liquid state but solidi- fied and, at a later period, affected by granitization. 364</page><page sequence="9">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM l'imagination sensorielle doit Atre n6gli- gee"), and they showed the importance of logical reasoning, "the only instru- ment which can give access to these for- bidden domains" ("le seul instrument qui puisse nous ouvrir l'acces de ces do- maines interdits"). In tectonics the "anthropomorphic" necessity of a plastic state of rocks no longer exists, and many authors admit the "flowing" of mountains by the action of gravity. A similar mental attitude seems indispensable when considering the petrography of granular rocks; for the problem is to determine whether a subjective impression is to prevail over rational deductions drawn from indisput- able observations. With this attitude of mind, let us examine the fundamental facts which justify our way of thinking. NIGGLI'S OBJECTIONS First, we think it is necessary to an- swer briefly Niggli's three objections, mentioned at the beginning of this ar- ticle. The first concerns the difficulty of reactions in the solid state. Our present state of knowledge of chemistry makes a discussion of this point superfluous. Our earlier memoirs (1937, 1939) contained an extensive bibliography on the subject. Since then Jens A. W. Bugge (1946) and Hans Ramberg (1945), in particular, have shown anew the fundamental im- portance of these reactions. No petrog- rapher should deny, therefore, that dif- fusion of ions in crystalline lattices is an experimentally proved fact. Industry daily makes use of such controlled reac- tions, as in the preparation of magnesium by the action in vacuo of silicon on dolo- mite. Niggli asks whether emanations have been observed in the field and under the microscope and why they rise. We could answer that they were observed as well as the molekulardispersen Phase of Niggli and that they rise for the same reason. Professor Niggli apparently believes that it is normal for the pegmatitic solutions resulting from differentiation to rise (al- though he does not say how), but he asks, if the granite is itself the result of deeper emanations, where do they come from? In reality, observation shows that the phenomenon is not restricted to a rising of elements. Close study of the borders of a granite body, with or without zones of "eruptive breccia" or of "magmatic stop- ing," and of the evolution of the inclu- sions (enclaves) in any granite shows that certain elements came in while others went out. Referring to such zones, Niggli wrote (1942, p. 41) that it is difficult to deci- pher from the final product all the stages of formation, because what has been a successive series appears in juxtaposition (das Nacheinander wie ein Nebeneinander erscheint). We do not agree with him; anyone who has examined border zones knows that it is possible to find practical- ly all stages of transformation in the dif- ferent inclusions, from the original rock (completely or nearly intact) to rocks hardly distinguishable from granite. This was observed by Lacroix in the Pyrenees (1898-1900). Raguin writes, about a schist-granite contact, that one passes into the other by a series of steps ("du schiste au granite, il y a ainsi continuit6 par une serie d'chantillons"), and he de- scribes examples of intermediate zones between the enclosing rock and the granite. Simple visual examination of the inclu- sions obviously indicates that this grada- tion usually is characterized by increase in the proportion of alkaline feldspars and a decrease of the ferromagnesian elements. We have called attention to the impor- 365</page><page sequence="10">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT tance of diffusions d double sens (1946a), and recently Holmes and Reynolds (1947, p. 55) have given a new and mag- nificent example of this phenomenon. Such diffusions seem to be a general phe- nomenon, observed not only in cases of granitization but also in basic rocks. In the latter case nonalkaline elements, such as alumina or iron oxide, are diffused to- ward the enclosing rocks (Tilley, 1947, p. o104; Lacroix, 1899). The phenomenon also seems to be characteristic of meta- morphism generally (Lapadu-Hargues, 1945; Perrin and Roubault, 1946). There- fore, the assertion that granitization is accompanied by diffusions d double sens is proved by verified facts. It is unimpor- tant that the reasons for these deep ex- changes are not yet apparent; the facts are there and are incompatible with the theories of simple influx of residual solu- tions, pore solutions, etc. On the contra- ry, they are observed in the case of reac- tions in the solid state. Niggli asks what mysterious force al- ways tends to transform the sediments into the same type of rock-granite or granodiorite. Niggli's idea is clear: it is normal for magmatic differentiation to tend toward a single rock type, but not for metamorphism to do so. He criticizes Van Bemmelen and Backlund (1942, p. 17), who think that the type "granite" is the expression of a tendency toward homogenization, toward a state of equi- librium. Let us note, first, that there is a tendency, not toward a single chemical composition, but rather toward an aver- age chemical composition. This is made obvious by the very existence of Atlan- tic, Pacific, and Mediterranean prov- inces, by the diversity of composition of crystalline massifs-in brief, by the mass of evidence which has led to the theory of differentiation. In spite of this, the tendency toward homogenization re- mains an observed fact: granites tend to alkalinize their inclusions and gabbros to basify theirs, etc. Recently, Lapadu-Hargues (1945) in- vestigated the composition of a great number of "silica-alumina" rocks, from unaltered sediments to mica schists, gneiss, and even granite. He plotted the percentage of alkalines in molecular pro- portions as the ordinate and the percent- age of alumina as the abscissa. For each rock type he drew a line enclosing the representative points of the alkali/alumi- na ratio, then connected the average points of the zones. He found, first of all, that the areas over which the points were distributed became smaller as the degree or metamorphism increased-in other words, the dispersion of analyses of rocks of the same type from different countries of the world decreases as the intensity of metamorphism increases. Moreover, he found that no break occurs in the line at the boundary of the gneiss and the gran- ites. Thus the tendency to homogeniza- tion is evident in general metamorphism; with the transformist theory in mind it does not seem extraordinary that this tendency would be maximized in granite. It should not be forgotten that geo- physicists consider the heterogeneity of the earth's crust as only superficial. Con- sequently, it is not unreasonable to be- lieve that sedimentary rocks, derived by alteration of the primitive crust, poorer than the crust in alkaline constituents, are in chemical equilibrium neither among themselves nor with their sub- stratum. If at some time proper thermo- dynamic conditions arose, we do not see what would prevent homogenization by diffusion of ions, with the rising of alka- lies from below. We shall now discuss results of incom- plete homogenization, namely, the so- called "eruptive" systems formed pri- 366</page><page sequence="11">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM marily from pre-existing detrital rocks. The world-wide abundance of granites and granodiorites testifies only to an an- cient predominance of siliceous and sili- co-aluminous detrital rocks. This does not seem to us to be inconsistent with the existence of petrographic provinces. Let us now examine the principal facts which support our viewpoint. THE FACTS FELDSPATHIZAT1ON OF THE COUNTRY ROCKS AND OF INCLUSIONS Many authors have pointed out the existence outside of granite (either in the enclosing country rock, which indis- putably remained solid, or in inclusions) of feldspars that are identical with those of the granite in every characteristic: composition, size, shape, color, inclu- sions, presence of microperthite, zonation (orthoclase surrounded by oligoclase, as in the rapakivi granite), etc. Large crys- tals of feldspar may even be found astride the granite contact. We have al- ready dealt at length with this subject (1939, pp. 69 ff., pi. i, fig. 15), taking into account the observations of other au- thors as well as our own. H. H. Read has independently cited similar examples. This extremely common observation is the basis of our ideas. Because forms of crystallization are so sensitive to chemi- cal composition and environment, we concluded: The probability that crystals of feldspars, identical in every way, could have originated and grown under such radically different conditions as those of an acid liquid magma on the one hand, and of a solid rock (with a different composi- tion, even mesocratic in some cases) on the other hand, is practically nil-and feldspars of a granite identical with those of the different, solid country rock, originated under the same conditions, that is to say, in the solid state.7 7 "La probabilit6 pour que des cristaux de felds- paths, identiques en tous points, aient pu naitre et In a less precise, but more pungent wording, Read takes up the argument: One can, of course, believe that the two sets of feldspars, though admittedly identical, are really formed in two quite different environ- ments, one magmatic and the other solid rock. I am tempted to remark, as the Duke of Wellington did on another occasion, that if one can believe this, one can believe anything! If this is really true, in view of the profound differences in the environments, I feel that a great part of the lore about magmatic crystalli- zation becomes meaningless. I consider it more reasonable, and in the ultimate more honest, to hold that there is only one environment, that of the solid country rock [I944, p. 86]. Niggli and Reinhard made no refer- ence to these observations or to the de- ductions drawn from them. Only Raguin attempted an explanation (1946, p. 184) by calling on Fenner's hypothesis, ac- cording to which, ". .. if three phases, solid, liquid, and gaseous, are in equil:, rium, the deposition of crystals out of the liquid should be accompanied by the deposition of the same crystals out of the gases" ("si trois phases, solide, liquide, gazeuse sont en 6quilibre, le dep6t de cristaux a partir du liquide doit s'accom- pagner du d6p6t des memes cristaux a partir de vapeurs"). However, the same author very prudently wrote also: If there is, in cases of this sort, an objection to the passage of the granite through the liquid state, one may answer that, among the pre- vailing chemico-physical conditions, no one knows which determine the composition and the facies of the feldspar crystals formed. It is possible that, among these factors, the liquid state, more or less advanced, is not essential. At se developper dans des conditions aussi radicalement differentes que celles de cristallisation dans un magma fondu acide, d'une part, et de cristallisa- tion dans un milieu solide, de composition diff- rente, allant jusqu'd des roches mesocrates, d'autre part, est pratiquement nulle et les feldspaths du granite, identiques a ceux des terrains 6trangers solides, ont pris naissance dans les memes conditions, c'est-A-dire dans le solide." 367</page><page sequence="12">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT the moment of crystallization of the feldspars, the granite is no longer liquid, but mixed, with numerous solid particles in suspension. Recipro- cally, the surroundings are soaked in the solu- tions. The physical states are perhaps no longer very different.8 Here again Wellington's remark comes to our mind. So, before changing our opinion, we shall await an incontrover- tible explanation of the phenomena of feldspathization based on the magmatic theory. THE PHENOMENON OF DOUBLE AND RECIPROCAL INCLUSIONS The formation of crystals in the coun- try rock or in inclusions identical with those of the granite is not restricted to the alkaline feldspars, particularly ortho- clase. Plagioclase and ferromagnesian minerals may occur in a similar manner; the examination of certain contacts gives the impression that granitization grows somewhat like a mold which invades the enclosing rocks little by little. There are either numerous isolated crystals on the bottom of the old rock corresponding to what we have called the "progression de la granitisation en cristaux isoles" (1939, p. 75) or actual granitic areas inside the rock (1939, pl. i, photo 3). The two phe- nomena are closely associated. Read (1944, pp. 86-87) has reported similar ob- servations. The continuity of the phenomenon is 8 "S'il y a, dans les faits de ce genre, une objec- tion au passage du granite par l'etat liquide, on peut repondre que, parmi les facteurs physico chimiques regnants, nul ne salt quels sont ceux qui determinent la composition et le facies des cristaux naissants de feldspaths. II est possible que, parmi ces facteurs, l'6tat liquide plus ou moins avanc6 ne soit pas essen- tiel. Au moment de la cristallisation des feldspaths, le granite n'est plus liquide, mais 'mixte' avec de nombreuses particules en suspension. Recipro- quement l'aureole est alors imbib6e de microsolu- tions. Les 6tats physiques ne sont peut-etre plus tres diff6rents." demonstrated by microscopic examina- tion. In the case of the granite of Tre- beurden, Bretagne, we have observed crystals of orthoclase with quartz, or crys- tals of orthoclase associated with plagio- clases (1939, pi. 3, microphoto 4). Final- ly, there occur masses of granite existing as inclusions within the inclusions of the same granite-it is to this phenomenon that we have given the name of "double inclusion" (double enclave).9 Also observed is granite which con- tains inclusions of the surrounding rock, and, reciprocally, this rock contains in- clusions of granite. This we term the "phenomenon of reciprocal inclusions." We have given an example of this from B6nodet, Bretagne (1947), and analogous observations have been reported by Wenk (1943, p. 267) and Barth (1947, p. I78). Some "magmatists" will be tempted here to invoke Ausbliitungen, which, ac- cording to the proponents of this hypoth- esis, are mixtures with minimum melting points, the melting points having been lowered by water, which afterward dis- appeared. We have already pointed out that a number of hypotheses are needed to support Ausbliitung. In the present case an explanation by means of Ausbli- tung with minimum melting point is im- possible by reason of the observed con- tinuity from the individual feldspar crys- tals (with a high melting point) to whole granitic bands. An indisputable geologic fact remains: there have existed, in rocks in contact with granite or enclosed within it, favored points where there were formed crystals identical with those of the granite, followed by the formation of whole granitic zones. 9 Raguin (1946, p. 183) explains double enclave as the presence of separate crystals of orthoclase in inclusions of the granite; we consider that a simple case of feldspathization of the inclusions. 368</page><page sequence="13">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM DIGESTION OF DIKES BY GRANITE Dikes of several kinds, with sharp con- tacts and parallel edges (diabase, doler- ite, aplite, granulite), intersect a granite, but in places some. granite "apophyses" project into the dike or may even replace it entirely and retain a few widely sepa- rated and more or less transformed inclu- sions of the vein (Perrin and Roubault, 1939, PP. 127-129; 1947). Sederholm (1923-1926) observed simi- lar phenomena, which he ascribed to a "reviviscence" of the granite. The latter, after having been cut by the dike, would have remelted and been injected into some fissures opened in the dike. Raguin (1946, p. 19) reverts to this hypothesis in studying a dike which intersects an old granite, described by Sederholm. He adds: "A paradoxical fact, this granite is at the same time much older and much younger than this basalt" ("Fait para- doxal, ce granite est a la fois beaucoup plus vieux et beaucoup plus jeune que ce basalte"). It is simple and positive! How did the granite melt again? How else except with the help of water because water is necessary for the refusion. The solidified granite all at once received a lot of water as the temperature rose; but, in spite of an implied large increase in volume, no mechanical strains resulted, as there is no evidence of deformation in the intact or unaltered portion of the dike. However, some fissures were opened, and the "revivified" granite was injected into these fractures; then the water went away, and all was normal again. The water must not have reached the dike or else (according to the classical theories) it would have been melted because its melting point ought to be lower than that of granite, even if it were aplite or granu- lite. Unfortunately for the theory, in many cases there is not only the appearance of injection but actually of digestion-of magmatic stoping or complete digestion. In some examples even the edges of the dike remain unchanged in the digested parts (Perrin and Roubault, 1939, pl. III, fig. 3; I947)- We shall not, for the time being, form a hypothesis concerning the genesis of the dikes; but, whatever the hypothesis, the contents of basalt or diabase dikes were injected in a liquid state. The relat- ed magma then intersected solid rock, and the granite was substituted in these necessarily solid rocks; the granite di- gested in places the earlier dikes as it di- gested the enclosing rock. This graniti- zation was possible only in the solid state; for, in the midst of the melted granite, some of the dikes of aplite or granulite, theoretically more fusible, would have melted and been mixed into the granitic magma. NONSETTLING OF INCLUSIONS Inclusions, very common in contact zones, even some of great size and heavi- er than granite, have remained in place. All the theories of Bowen and Niggli are based on the settling of little crystals of olivine or amphibole; but these same authors do not find abnormal the failure of enormous inclusions to settle. Such an attitude leaves us amazed! Some authors believe that the granite of border zones was extremely viscous. But we note that this granite, rich in pegmatitic solutions, cannot have high viscosity and, at the same time, the ex- treme fluidity necessary for the forma- tion of lit-par-lit injections. Observation shows that inclusions rich in "ferromagnesian" minerals are very common in the heart of granite masses. Some of them are homoeogines and others inallogines, according to Lacroix's ter- minology. For all of them the melting 369</page><page sequence="14">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT point is (according to the "magmatist" theories) higher than that of the granite, and their density is also greater. Al- though located in zones where there was no exceptional cooling, they did not settle. Lacroix and many others have empha- sized the extreme slowness of the graniti- zation processes. The failure of the inclu- sions to sink is compatible, therefore, only with a state of "infinite" viscosity- the viscosity of solids. EVOLUTION OF CRYSTALLIZATION We have considered, first, some funda- mental field observations and then some equally basic details of crystallization of the minerals of granite and of associated rocks. Lack of space prevents discussion here of the phenomenon of corrosion be- tween crystals (Perrin and Roubault, I939, p. i60, pi. 5, microphotos 7 and 8). Other authors, in particular Shand (1942) and Bugge (1946), have made similar observations of this very common phenomenon. We shall cite as an example only the plagioclase "islets," unquestionably "cor- roded," surrounded by quartz and ar- ranged in such a manner that the twin- ning planes are rigorously parallel. In ad- dition, twinning bands of the same width are clearly aligned from one "islet" to an- other. In such a case dissolution is out of the question. The new crystals were sub- stituted for the old ones by the substitu- tion of the new lattice for the old, and this was possible only by the diffusion of ions of alumina, sodium, and calcium, which diffused through the crystalline lattice of the quartz to become fixed at more or less distant points. The same is true of hornblende replacement by ortho- clase (Perrin and Roubault, 1939, pi. 3, photos 6 and 7); some calcium, iron, and magnesium ions diffused through the crystalline lattice of the orthoclase, and potassium ions diffused in the opposite direction to nourish the orthoclase lat- tice. Here is unquestionable evidence of diffusion in two directions in a solid state -diffusions observable on the micro- scope stage. Water or, more correctly, hydroxyl OH, is but a special case of the diffusion of hydrogen ions. Bugge (1946) insists that, even if the constituents of a hy- drated mineral were substituted in such a fashion, the reaction should be consid- ered as taking place in the solid state. Even if the processes had been "set off" by gases, pore solutions, or inter- granular films, microscopic observations demonstrate that diffusion of ions through the crystalline lattice was nec- essary. As an example, Shand (1942, p. 417) described "some plates of horn- blende which enclosed the corroded but undissolved remnants of the three min- erals [hypersthene, augite, and plagio- clase]"-how else may we explain the transformation of a pyroxene fragment wholly enclosed by the hornblende? Along the same line we have never understood how authors who invoke gases or pore solutions can thus explain the formation, in a solid rock, of a meta- cryst of orthoclase which replaces an ag- gregate of quartz, biotite, and plagio- clase; replacement requires that iron, magnesium, and calcium have gone out and potassium come in. In the light of modern physicochemical knowledge we see only one possible explanation: diffu- sion in two directions through the lattice. RATE OF GRANITIZATION Along the borders of many granitic systems (Mont-Blanc, Pyrenees, Massif de Bergell, etc.) are found inclusions of the country rocks. Some of these inclu- sions, located very far from the contacts, 370</page><page sequence="15">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM are at different stages of transformation. The very existence of incomplete trans- formation revealed by the study of these inclusions indicates extremely slow proc- esses. These processes were certainly much slower than the known speed of homogenization in a liquid state. They were also much slower than the speed of solution of a silicate solid in a molten silicate bath. Let us recall here the per- fect miscibility of silicates. The slowness of reactions of diffusions in the solid state has been cited as an ob- jection by some. To us it seems, on the contrary, indispensable to explain the facts, even in proved cases of diffusion over long distances. Taking into account the enormous duration of geologic time, experimentally determined speeds of re- actions in the solid state would be much too great for the inclusions to survive. When Bugge (1946, p. 48) writes: "The chief objections against such a long dis- tance diffusion of ions through the crys- tals is the small rate of diffusion. But I do not think this is a deciding objection. The total development of a mountain range comprises a period 250-300 million years," we quite agree with him, but with a difference. This slowness is a favorable, rather than a negative, argument for our viewpoint. THE ERUPTIVE CHARACTER OF GRANITE DIKES AND APOPHYSESI0 The eruptive character, or "aspect," is the basis for the classical conception of melted granite; it is therefore normal that it should form the "anthropomor- 1o Some authors (Wegmann, Green, Backlund, MacGregor and Wilson, and Reynolds) are quoted by Read in support of the hypothesis of "mobiliza- tion" to explain the eruptive aspect. We believe it unnecessary to envisage, for most cases, any major movement-in our opinion, and therefore in our analysis, the explanation of the eruptive aspect is different. phic" objection to our conceptions. Fol- lowing are some facts. We have previously described (I939, p. 95) the occurrence in some crystalline granitic masses of crystals of feldspar or amphibole in what appear to be apophy- ses or veins with parallel edges, but of coarser grain than the crystalline massif itself. The injection of a liquid in a pre- existing slit is out of the question. We have published photographs of this phe- nomenon (1939, pi. I, photos 6 and Io) and have since observed new examples of the same thing on the Brittany coast (in the Argenton area, in Finistere). We have also published observations on granite "veinlets" of the Anse de Sciottot, near Flamanville (1938a). Transverse sillimanite-rich zones in the granite dike appear to be but prolonga- tions of such zones in the country rock, and they thus preclude the possibility of a liquid injection of the dike. A very fine and quite similar example has just been described by Bearth (i945). He figured a granite apophysis of the "Mont Rose" in clear discordance with the paragneiss and described some garnet beds of the gneiss which continue into the granite. He con- cludes that the granitization is thus the result of a metasomatic process or re- placement. No comment appears necessary. Injec- tion of liquid is out of the question in this splendid example in which the garnet lines remained in place, just as zones of inclusions commonly do. We have in this example obvious proof of the emplace- ment of granite dikes by means of simple chemical exchange, to the exclusion of any injection. The alignment of discrete and sepa- rated feldspar crystals, which we as well as Charles Barrois and Auguste Michel- L6vy have described (1939, pp. 96-100), is a related phenomenon. Did not Barrois 371</page><page sequence="16">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT use the words filons moniliformes to char- acterize these peculiar alignments? After our first memoir we published a new study, with photographs (i938b), on the phenomena of magmatic stoping at St- Jean-du-Doigt and also observed another splendid example at Argenton, Finistere. In all these cases, in order to explain such alignments by the hypothesis of liquid injection, we must imagine some mysterious fissures which would later heal over without leaving any evidence. Must we also, perhaps, admit of cavities prepared in anticipation of the injec- tions? In the absence of such openings, what is the mysterious composition of a liquid which, by solution of hornblende and plagioclase, would lead to ortho- clase? If we are not to search for an inter- pretation which would at any cost save the idea of liquid injection, this phenom- enon must be considered, as being of the same nature as that responsible for feld- spars in the rocks bordering granitic masses. The feldspars found in the country rock are the crystal precursors of the normal granitization front; in like man- ner, the aligned feldspars are the precur- sor crystals of the apophyses or dikes of granite or pegmatite. We must therefore accept the idea that, in some cases, graniti- zation follows preferred directions; it re- sults, therefore, in the construction of apophyses or dikes. The phenomenon is the same whether granite proper or pegmatite or aplite is in question." ARE THERE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR THE GENESIS OF GRANITES AND ASSOCI- ATED GRANULAR ROCKS? Taking the advice of Maillet and Pavans de Ceccaty (1937), we have tried to neglect imagination sensorielle, to leave out of account the representations concretes to which our senses are accus- tomed, and to outline a theory for the genesis of granites from the observation of incontestable facts. Have we the right to extend to all granites the conclusions which have forced themselves upon us? Let us make it clear that we are con- cerned only with the process of granitiza- tion. We do not consider the fact that a granite can be formed by substitution from very different rocks-sedimentary, metamorphic, microlithic (such as lavas), or even other granites. Thus we do not exclude the possibility that some gran- ites or some granular rocks could have been formed through mere recrystalliza- tion in a solid state of eruptive rocks. One of us (Roubault, 1935) has described aplite veins in Kabylie de Collo, where the petrographic relationship with the rhyolite veins of the same area is obvious. We think it quite possible that the re- crystallization of veins whose contents were originally formed by a liquid lava has resulted in a granular rock of the same or very similar composition. All the observations that we have made lead us only to the belief that some diffusion, however slight it may be, is necessary for crystallization into a true granite with coarse constituents. But the essential problem is to determine wheth- er granitic texture always originates in the solid state. This is the crucial point. An increasing number of geologists, at first incredulous, now admit the possi- bility of granitization in the solid state but are reluctant to admit its prevalence. They tend to hold the opinion of Read, who wrote: "There are granites and granites." This author does not deny the " After considerable delay there has just come to our attention an article by H. G. Backlund (1943), in which we are pleased to find ideas convergent with our own. Wegmann's excellent observations (1943) concerning progressive granitization of the Amistock conglomerate in Greenland also adds new evidence favoring our thesis. 372</page><page sequence="17">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM possibility of a magmatic origin for little granitic bodies whose emplacement is not an insoluble problem; on the other hand, he repudiates it for most granitic masses and especially the big ones. As noted elsewhere, Max Reinhard, too, believes in the formation of granite without melting, by metasomatosis, but he also admits two other possible geneses: juvenile granites and palingenetic gran- ites. Niggli (1942, p. 83) approvingly quotes Frank Grout's remarks: Recent writers have now suggested that igneous-looking rocks resulted from meta- somatism in so many places that they assume the process is established, wholly fail to see the complexity of the problem, and quote each other as authorities, but not one area has been described convincingly. It seems that the enthusiastic advocates carry their idea too far, applying it to masses several miles across; the conservatives admit a few feet; the truth may lie between, but the conservatives have the weight of evidence on their side, and the burden of proof is on the advocates of extensive granitization. Grout seems to have summarized the situation quite well." The present con- flict is epitomized by the following quota- tion from H. H. Read (1944, p. 86): The inability of the magmatists to interpret the plain field-facts arises from the inertia of a century of belief in the magmatic origin of all granitic rocks. The inertia has been increased for many by the addition of weighty physico- chemical arguments which "explained" the phenomena. It takes a certain amount of cour- age to go around to the other side of these prob- lems and look at them from a completely differ- ent situation. The weight of evidence claimed by Grout does not seem very heavy to Read. Having for thirteen years had the cour- age to differ from the authorities, we con- 12 In 1941 Grout knew only one of our granite papers-the one about "magmatic stoping" of St- Jean-du-Doigt, which he quotes; accordingly, he makes no reference to our other observations and arguments. tinue to behave as representatives of the "extreme left," not because we mischie- vously want to look like revolutionaries, but because we know of no fact which would justify our setting a boundary be- tween the "few feet" and the "several miles"-and we do not want to say, out of caution, something that we do not be- lieve. At the risk of repeating ourselves, we think it necessary at this point to outline the granite problem as it appears from the writings of even the most "magma- tist" authors. None of them (Niggli, Raguin, Grout, or Reinhard, for ex- ample) would think of denying that rocks indistinguishable from granites were formed in the solid state by meta- morphism or metasomatism. Nor would they deny gradation from granite to alien rocks of sedimentary origin, in particu- lar, crystalline schists, paragneiss, quartz- ite, etc. However, the "magmatists" con- sider that only border phenomena are in question; Grout's "few feet" are ex- plained by the phenomenon (or, more correctly, the word) of "convergence," so they go on thinking of the interior as resulting from the crystallization of a liquid. Raguin (1946, p. 68) admits such a convergence between a granite with en- domorphic alteration and its sides or its exomorphosed inclusions. The same con- vergence is envisaged even where the granite border has not been endomorphi- cally altered. Grout, who does not deny the continuity, evokes the difficulty of proving metamorphic origin inside the massif. As to Reinhard, he admits the total structural convergence of meta- somatic, juvenile, and palingenetic gran- ites. Behind all the words and reservations is the following important hypothesis: Similar granitic structures can result from processes as radically different as 373</page><page sequence="18">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT crystallization from a liquid and trans- formation of a solid rock by means of chemical changes in the solid state. Nig- gli (1942, p. 60) and Reinhard (1943, p. 24) say so plainly: "Material transfer may result in structures convergent with magmatic structures; even if the meta- morphism takes place in the solid state," and "Granite may be formed from sand- stones and clays through such metaso- matic-metamorphic processes without liquefaction. These granites do not differ from magmatic granites either in mineral composition or in fabric" ("Stoffwander- ungen k6nnen zu Konvergenzen mit Metamorphose im festen Zustand erfolg- te," and "Es k6nnen aus Sandsteinen und Tonen durch solche metasomatisch- metamorphe Prozesse ohne Enischmel- zung Granite gebildet werden, die sich weder in Mineralbestand noch im Gefige von magmatisch entstandenen Graniten unterscheiden"). The thought behind the words is obvious: "endomorphe" sup- poses a melted state, "exomorphe" a solid state. We wonder if these scientists realize the full implications of the hy- potheses thus expressed, numerous singu- larities of granite structure and composi- tion being considered; for in the two cases the characteristics are the same down to the slightest detail. To put it emphatically: the probability of producing such similar structures by such diferent processes seems to us absolutely nil; and we think it wrong to postulate such funda- mental differences in genesis when ob- servation reveals only continuous grada- tion. Therefore, either all the observed rocks passed through the liquid state or they remained in the solid state. Nor have we the right, in our opinion, to imagine a semimelted state between the two. Before closing, we should like to point out that the observations which support our arguments were made by many au- thors independently in many parts of the world. As several authors have noted and as Read has emphasized, the pavements, the monuments, and the building fronts of the cities of the world offer countless examples; it seems as though they would shout the fact to petrographers. We would not go so far as to wish, as Read humorously did (i944, p. 50) regarding the twelve columns of Wisdom, that characteristic chips might be detached by air bombardment. But we both have traveled extensively and made the same observations from northern Europe to central Africa and across the United States. As Read has written, "Every city has on free display magnificent examples of granitization and migmatization." We are even astonished that the phe- nomenon which is at the base of our con- ceptions did not attract more attention among geologists. Unquestionably, we are concerned with a very general phe- nomenon, visible in all the granites of the world, which may therefore be consid- ered characteristic of granite origin. Let those who want to be convinced of it fol- low Read's advice and look at the "free displays" of their towns. It is the same with regard to the double enclave phenomenon and the digestion of veins. As to diffusion in two directions in the border zones and in the inclusions, we shall only refer to the work of H. G. Backlund and of Bugge on arendalites (1946). We have ourselves pointed out the very general occurrence of intercrys- talline corrosion. Under the circumstances, we really do not see why the importance of the ob- servations should be limited to some granites and to distances of but a few feet, especially (as Read pointed out) be- cause it is in the larger granitic systems 374</page><page sequence="19">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM that emplacement in the molten state is inconceivable. We think also that it would be dis- honest of us to imagine a different genesis for diorites, gabbros, and other granular rocks. The diorites and gabbros, chiefly the former, often constitute an "endo- morphic" alteration of granite. Nor should we forget the digestion of country rock with "endomorphism" of gabbros (Lacroix, 1899), the basification of acid inclusions in gabbros, banded gabbros, and the alternate beds of ariegite and lherzolite. At the risk of having Niggli accuse us of willingness to revive a "universal theory" incapable of explaining the mul- tiplicity of geologic facts, we shall indi- cate briefly why we believe the mechan- ism of diffusion a double sens in the solid state has an importance far beyond the case of the so-called "igneous" rocks. First, as we have already written (1939, p. 145), we think that some "ex- truded" rocks, i.e., lavas, underwent such diffusions after cooling, with the forma- tion of phenocrysts, which were by no means formed in the first stage of con- solidation. Later we observed at St- Jean-du-Doigt in Brittany feldspathiza- tion of some of the enclosing rock, lead- ing to the formation of feldspar crystals, which gave these materials an absolutely clear appearance of two times of crystal- lization (1938b). Observations on other lavas by other authors lead us to the belief that later diffusions have had a very clear influence upon the appearance of these lavas in the solid state. Approaching, now, the problem of metamorphism in general, such work as Lapadu-Hargues's statistical study dem- onstrates fractional diffusion (diffusions fractiones) in two directions-a process identical with that of granitization. Fur- thermore, in what is apparently a case of pure dynamic metamorphism, at Tre la Tete in the Mont Blanc system, we showed (i946b) by analysis and thin sec- tion the existence of these diffusions. This confirmed our idea that there is no break (coupure) between regional and dynamic metamorphism. Lastly, in many gneisses and mica schists, we find the same phenomena of superposition in crystallization between crystals and of crystal corrosion, as in granites. In the tradition of the French petro- graphic school and of Auguste Michel- Levy, we do not think it possible to prove that granitization, contact metamor- phism, and general metamorphism are of different natures. Being perhaps less pru- dent than some other authors (like Bugge, who, however, emphasizes the important role of reactions in the solid state), we do not consider other mecha- nisms, like liquid infiltration, very im- portant. We would except, of course, the cases of lavas and some metallic vein phe- nomena. As to Wegmann's intergranular films, they do not seem to have played a very important part. The following reasons lead us to the above conclusions. i. Crystal corrosion necessarily im- plies diffusions in the lattice, and conse- quently we see no necessity for recourse to another phenomenon. 2. Geological observations seem to show that the larger the crystals, the more intense the exchanges, although the opposite should be true if the major role were played by diffusion along the ad- joining surfaces because these surfaces are smaller in proportion as crystal sizes increase. Lastly, we are more and more con- vinced of the major role played by dif- fusion in the solid state in the genesis of 375</page><page sequence="20">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT many metalliferous ore deposits, par- ticularly igneous deposits. In 1934 one of us had already expressed this idea as a hypothesis (Perrin). The many discus- sions now appearing in the literature con- cerning the nature of some deposits, termed "hypothermal," "contact," or "segregation," and the increasingly fre- quent observation in ores of replacement structures and of crystallization with corrosion show that their genesis cer- tainly depended upon the same mecha- nism as that of granular rocks. In closing this paper, Read's humor- ous sentence comes to mind (1944, p. 84): "Nobody except him who has learnt less and forgotten less than any Bourbon can deny the validity of the conversion 'of solid rocks to rocks of granitic char- acter without passing through a mag- matic stage.' " We shall only point out to Read that it is not easy to get away from ideas which have impregnated one's mind since youth to such a degree that they have become a habit of thought, a habit of reasoning, a habit of language. Per- haps it is even harder not to be guided by subjective "anthropomorphic" impres- sions. As for us, we are convinced that not without an inner qualm do some eminent scientists make use, for the lack of a bet- ter one, of the word "convergence." SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS We had finished the preceding article when we received the report of the sym- posium on the origin of granite held at the December, 1947, meeting of the Geo- logical Society of America. Perusal of this report leads us to add the comments be- low. i. Professor Grout, citing Read's dis- cussion of feldspars, writes: "This has no basis in chemistry or in logic." Professor Shand also sees no reason why the same feldspars cannot have their origin in the country rock and in the magma under the same pressure and temperature con- ditions. Both completely exclude the fundamental influence on crystal growth of the medium in which the crystals were formed. We repeat that there is no prob- ability that crystals identical even to minute details (shape, color, inclusions) could be formed in part by replacement of solid crystals in a solid medium and in part by crystallization starting from a molten magma. In order to be sure, we have discussed the matter with eminent nongeological specialists, and their opin- ion exactly concurs with ours. Further- more, we should like to learn how Grout and Shand explain the porphyritic crys- tals which lie across the boundary of the granite and the country rock, as well as granitic bodies entirely isolated in coun- try rock near the contact. 2. Dr. Bowen criticizes but one cita- tion out of a hundred concerning reac- tions in the solid state-Greig's work on silica bricks-thinking, perhaps, that this one would throw doubt on our entire theory. He makes no reference to Adams' observations or to Perrin's experiments on refractories, in the course of which not the slightest trace of liquid could be found. Our experience with metallurgical linings enables us to state that if we men- tioned a "purely hypothetical intermedi- ary liquid" (intermediaire liquide pure- ment hypothutique) to explain the reaction mechanism, it was because we thought that, in the case of such phenomena, the existence of liquids is not the cause but the result; diffusion of elements in the solid state lowers the melting points of refractories while altering their composi- tion, and liquid parts are formed. Bowen cites, as evidence against our theory, the existence of zoned feldspars, 376</page><page sequence="21">ON THE GRANITE PROBLEM apparently claiming that the speed of homogenization of heterogeneous crys- tals of the same crystalline system are, in principle, the same as all rates of ionic diffusion, particularly those which lead to the replacement by substitution of one crystalline network for another. This is certainly erroneous (Perrin and Rou- bault, 1937, P- 58). Homogenization is a phenomenon which in many cases re- quires high temperatures. Bowen (1926) has shown that for the solid solution of NH4C1-NH4NO3 the homogenization temperature is very near the melting point. In our opinion it is much harder to understand why homogenization did not take place at the time of the certainly very slow cooling of a previously molten magma than is the case of reactions in the solid state, which experiments have shown to take place at temperatures much lower than the melting point (for example, BaO and SiO, at 3570 [Hedwall] CaO+sillimanite, resulting in metasili- cate of lime and alumina at 5300 [Taylor], etc.). Why did homogenization not take place in the process considered by Bow- en, which requires much higher tempera- tures than ours? Everyone knows that speed of diffusion increases very rapidly as the temperature increases. Bowen would give much better support to his theories if he would indicate how they can account for plagioclase with com- pletely reversed zoning: labradorite in the center and anorthite around it. How can they explain the existence of feld- spars in diorites, theoretically magmatic in origin but which are, in fact, one of the endomorphic facies of granite (La- croix, 1898-1900)? This phenomenon of inverse zoning is in direct contradiction with Bowen's own experimental diagram of solidification. In a different way, Bowen criticizes the theories of Ramberg and Bugge, which are merely the first tentative ef- forts at the erection of a theoretical basis for diffusion in the solid state as applied to geological problems. We believe the logical way to make progress in this problem must be (a) the making of field observations, (b) the drawing of scientific deductions from these observations, disregarding "an- thropomorphism," and (c) the construc- tion of a general theory of the processes. It is the general aspect, as seen in the field, which has led us to believe in the process of diffusion in the solid state. It is almost inconceivable that Ram- berg and Bugge could have succeeded, at the very first attempt, in formulating theories which could explain everything in a practically unexplored field like that of large-scale ionic diffusion. These au- thors, nevertheless, deserve a great deal of credit, as does Bowen for his attempt to set up a scientific magmatic theory. With a few exceptions, we might have agreed with him, if accurate observation had not shown that the facts demanded concepts of an entirely different nature. 3. Professor Read, although he favors a large part of our theories (since 1942 he has accepted unaware practically all our essential arguments concerning feldspars in the country rock), calls us "enthusi- asts." He considers that we go too far and that there are "granites and gran- ites," although he seems to leave but a small place to magmatic granites. We objected to the theory of total con- vergence of structure between rocks which would originate from entirely dif- ferent genetic processes; we will apply to geology a principle applied in other fields, that is not to introduce an arti- ficial hiatus where none has been ob- served. We note that in the course of the very 377</page><page sequence="22">R. PERRIN AND M. ROUBAULT interesting discussion at the Ottawa meeting, many petrographers asked for definite criteria for distinguishing the two kinds of granites, as there seemed to be no such criteria. This clearly shows that no one knows where the "hiatus" should be placed, and it is an encouragement for us to remain "enthusiasts." The only real, visible distinction, as indicated by Dr. Chapman, is the nonintrusive char- acter at depth and the intrusive at higher levels. But it so happens that the same body of granite has the two aspects, de- pending on the part of the border under consideration. Besides, feldspathization of country rock is considered clearer and more conclusive evidence of the intrusive origin. These remarks justify the special im- portance which we attach to evidence derived from accurately obtained samples in deciding that the intrusive aspect is not evidence of liquid flow but that, on the contrary, it coexisted with unques- tionable cases of replacement in the solid state. We are pleased to note Good- speed's striking example of granodiorite dikes with zoned feldspars, formed by re- placement, and Nelson's similar observa- tions. The simple anthropomorphic im- pression of injection of a liquid can no longer be taken as proof of such injection. Participants in the symposium dis- cussed the percentage of granites and granodiorites originating from magmas or by replacement in the solid state (de- spite convincing criteria for distinguish- ing them), and 15 per cent seems to have been suggested as a minimum for the latter by less optimistic members. In 1934 and 1935 Perrin came to the con- clusion that metamorphism took place by diffusion in the solid state and that granites were formed as a result of this process. He would have been called an enthusiast if he had estimated that 15 per cent, or even i per cent, of granites were thus formed. There is, therefore, some progress in our direction, and the recent discussions at the International Geological Congress in London have shown that we are not the only ones who think there are no magmatic granites in the strict meaning of the word. We admit, of course, that granites may result from the granitiza- tion of a lava, particularly of a rhyolite. Professor Read states that he has yet to be convinced of the possibility of the abrupt stopping of metamorphism by diffusion on meeting porous layers. We do not see how he, as a "metamorphist," can otherwise explain the genesis of cer- tain granites with strata of essentially unaltered quartzite within or in contact with the granites (Barrois, Lamotte and Routhier, Hietanen, et al.). The septa of limestone described by Moehlmann at the Ottawa meeting and many other phe- nomena also support this idea. REFERENCES CITED BACKLUND, H. G.
