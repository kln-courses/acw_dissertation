<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humanity between gods and beasts? Ontologies in question* G.E.R. Lloyd University of Cambridge Wherein lies the humanity of human beings? Many conflicting answers have been attempted in ancient and in modern times, with many focusing on the triadic relationship between humans, gods, and beasts. This article will review a wide range of suggestions, from those of ancient Greeks and Chinese, to recent anthropological proposals (by Viveiros de Castro and Descola in particular) of alternative ontologies. We have every reason to take rival human understandings seriously, but that should not be thought to lead to radical relativism, let alone to a breakdown of mutual intelligibility. Rather, they offer resources for exploring the substantive questions and for reflecting on the propensity of human beings to entertain or presuppose strong views on, precisely, what makes humans human. While evolutionary biology, ethology, cognitive science, and anthropology itself have all contributed to an increased recognition of the complexities of the question, we need the input not just of those disciplines, but also of philosophy and of history, to evaluate potential answers. In that spirit, the article offers an interdisciplinary commentary on the problems. One of the greatest modern interpreters of ancient Greek thought, who was one of my mentors as well as a close friend, Jean-Pierre Vernant, argued in a famous study that for the ancient Greeks, what it is to be human was defined by a triadic relation- ship, in which humans are sandwiched between gods, on the one hand, and the other animals, on the other.1 That might seem just an idiosyncratic notion of some ancient Greeks who are notorious for their vivid anthropomorphic imagination. This article sets out to explore the general issue, namely how did, how do, other societies get on with the business of defining what it is to be human, or what assumptions do they make on that score? Does being human arise as a problem, or is the concern not with other animals versus us, but between different human groups, between us and others, outsiders, strangers, enemies, who may or may not be humans exactly like us? The question of whether there are robust cross-cultural universais in this area - that is, in the understanding of what it is to be human - has recently received a lot of attention in anthropological debate, stimulated by the work of Viveiros de Castro and * Henry Myers Lecture, 2010.

But my studies of ancient societies, China as well as Greece, allow me to bring to bear some non-Western as well as premodern materials on such subjects. And since the question of alternative ontologies, alternative worlds, is in part a philosophical problem, I shall venture some comments on that, too, from my position on the sidelines. After briefly surveying the history of the Western debate, I shall outline the variety of views that can be found in Greek and Chinese thought. That will take me to the anthropological material and to the philo- sophical questions of the possibility of alternative worlds, the indeterminacy of trans- lation, and the possible incommensurability of conceptual systems, where again contrasting Greek and Chinese ontologies can be used to throw light on the issues. Throughout, my argument will be that we should resist the demand for simple answers to the question of what is distinctive about humanity. Rather, we should treat the divergences of the actual views that have been entertained as an opportunity to expand our own understanding. The history of the Western debate In fact, since the nineteenth century, attempts to settle on the defining characteristics of what it is to be a human have succeeded one another in Western thought with unnerving rapidity.2 No sooner had one proposal been tried and found wanting than another would be put forward, for it, in turn, more often than not, to founder. Is language an adequate criterion? That used to be one of the favourites. Aristotle already distinguished voice (which he recognizes in birds, for instance) from speech.3 But animals do not just communicate general messages. Evidently bird song is used to claim a territory and to find a mate, but there is much that we do not understand about the virtuosity of some bird performances: what does that add? There are still many questions we do not yet have answers to, as such authorities as Catchpole and Slater (2008) recognize. But animals also convey specific information. Vervets, for example, have one cry when the danger is a snake, another when it is a panther, a third when it is an eagle.4 And other creatures in their habitat can interpret those cries correctly: they understand the vervets' language, we could say, as is also the case when the vervets interpret correctly the alarm calls of other species, such as starlings. That is behaviour acquired in the wild, and in that respect more impressive than the well-known abilities of apes, such as the famous Washoe and Sarah, to recognize and manipulate signs, to solve puzzles, to express wants and feelings, and to attribute intentionality to others, for in those cases they were taught, of course, by humans. They have sometimes been cited, indeed, as evidence for the limitations of animal language acquisition, rather than for its potentialities.5 Another favourite was tool-making: Homo is Homo faber. But by now the evidence for some animals' abilities in that regard is overwhelming. Where there used to be just a few standard examples of animals using stones as hammers or anvils, we now have detailed documentation of, for instance, the techniques that chimpanzees have devised for ant or termite fishing.6 There are studies that show that some individual members of certain species are quick to learn from their conspecifics while others are very slow to do so. That suggests an obvious prima facie contrast between behaviour that is acquired, and what is innate, instinctive, or, as we now say, hard-wired, even though, as Bateson and Mameli (2007) and Nettle (2009) have recently insisted, that dichotomy, between the innate and the acquired, is less clear than is often assumed.

Wagner 1975)? Once again what seemed firm boundaries to earlier generations of researchers have been eroded. And once again the primatologists have led the way. In groups whose survival depends on close co-operation between the whole community, cheater detection mechanisms are needed to control or at least restrict free-riders, and these have been studied in a variety of species.7 Nor is it just primates that have complex social organizations. Where bees used to be the favourite example of this, with their social differentiations and communication abilities (the famous 'dance'), ants are now just as often cited, notably for their ability to 'farm' aphids as a source of food, and the habit, well known already to Darwin, of some species of ants to enslave other species.8 It was indeed Darwin's work especially that triggered the heightened interest in the question of the defining characteristics of humans in the mid-nineteenth century. It seemed to many more and more urgent to be able to draw the line between us and the other animals. Some were out to fill in the details of evolutionary theory, while others, to be sure, sought to gather evidence to refute it. But the question itself had, of course, a massively long history centuries before Darwin, in which Christianity looms large. Genesis had already taught that God created humans in his own image, giving them dominion over all other creatures. When they die, they just die; but we, as the New Testament and the subsequent teaching of the Church emphasized, are destined for immortality, in heaven or hell. Yet the Christian postulate of an immortal soul certainly did not resolve the key questions, not even for Christians. One that could and did repeatedly arise was whether creatures that certainly looked like humans were indeed endowed with those souls. When the conquistadors encountered native Americans in the Antilles, they wondered whether they were truly humans with souls that were there to be saved. The native Americans, for their part, conversely, worried whether the Spaniards had the same bodies as they themselves did. They drowned some of their Spanish prisoners to see whether they rotted. Lévi-Strauss, when citing this incident, pointed to the asymmetry: the Spaniards were tackling the problem like social scientists, while the Americans adopted what could be called a biological, scientific approach.9 Viveiros de Castro also cited that encounter in connection with his ideas on perspectivism, which I shall be considering shortly, but I use it now just to show that the Christian dogma still left open the question of which creatures were truly human, endowed with those immortal souls. Greek and Chinese views But many other answers besides Christian ones were given in antiquity to the question of what differentiates humans from other animals. The Christian legacy had, to be sure, particular impact on later European beliefs, but the issue was not just a concern for Christians, nor (as we shall see) just for Western thought.10 The Greeks, with whom I started, did not all agree on the subject - they hardly ever did. For the majority who practised the city-state religion, the distinctions that Vernant drew attention to were the ones that counted. The gods ate nectar and ambrosia and did not die. Beasts did not eat bread or cooked food and some of them were appropriate offerings for humans to make to gods. Humans in between ate bread, died, and entered into communication Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="4">832 G.E.R. Lloyd with the gods by means of sacrifices, of animals or of incense or of cakes. We have here then a classic ancient statement of the view that you are what you eat. Such beliefs were lived out and confirmed in state and domestic rituals throughout the year and were the subject of countless myths. But the philosophers came up with other ideas (as they often tend to do). Let me mention just three, those of Empedocles, Plato, and Aristotle. Before Empedocles, Pythagoras had already taught the doctrine of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls - which had the important moral conse- quence that how you were reborn - into what kind of animal or even plant - depended on how you lived your current life. But while Pythagoras himself is a rather shadowy figure, we know from the extant remains of the poetry of Empedocles how he devel- oped that notion. Transmigration already implied that all living things are kin. Empe- docles spelt out the implication that it was wrong to take life; wrong, therefore, to sacrifice animals on the altars of the gods.11 That overturned one of the cardinal institutions of the city-state religion, and remarkably, unlike some other religious innovators, he got away with it. Plato in turn flirted with the idea of transmigration in the Górgias , Republic , and Timaeus especially; it suited his moral teaching nicely that there were rewards and punishments in the afterlife. That underlined Socrates' message that the most impor- tant goal in life was to care for your immortal soul. But Plato's most influential doctrine related rather to his notion of a tripartite soul. The appetitive and the spirited parts, which humans share with animals, should be under the control of the rational faculty, the logistikou , a specifically human faculty. In the Timaeus (though not, it is true, so clearly in other dialogues), it is that part alone that is immortal.12 Aristotle, who knew more about animals than any other Greek, in turn drove a wedge between humans and them by way of the reasoning faculty, though there are considerable complications. First he recognized plenty of cognitive faculties in animals, not just perception but also imagination, intelligence ( phronesis ), including technical skills and the ability to learn.13 When he set out to consider the differences between all animals, humans included, he draws distinctions between their manners of life (bioi), activities ( praxeis ), and characters (ethe), as well as in their physical features, their parts {moria) ( History of Animals 487anff.). Some animals know what herbs will help to heal their wounds (6i2aiff.); one species of spider has a sense of the geometrical centre of their webs (623a7ff.); the construction techniques of swallows when they build their nests resemble those of human builders (6i2bi8ff.); while the complex social organi- zation of bees directed at the common good of the hive excites Aristotle's admiration (623bi7ff., 625bi7ff., 627a2off.). None of that stopped him from insisting in general terms that it is reason that marks out humans. But the second complication is that when reason is said to be immortal, this is not the passive reason (which ceases when we die) but the so-called 'active reason', where it is not at all clear whether he is talking about something human or something exclusively divine.14 God, for Aristotle, is identified as an Unmoved Mover who is responsible for the movements of the heavenly bodies not by pushing them, but by being the object of their love. He is a final cause, then, the good they aim at, not an ordinary efficient cause. But if we ask what activity God engages in (for He can hardly be idle or asleep), the answer is reasoning. And that, in Aristotle's view, is the highest faculty of which we humans are capable.15 So once again we have a sandwich. God is reason and reason alone: He does not need to perceive or imagine or move, let alone reproduce. We share the reasoning faculty Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="5">Humanity between gods and beasts? 833 with God, but also the other vital faculties, perception and the rest, with the other animals. But this is not just psychology, but morality, for we are enjoined to imitate Goďs activities as far as possible, to immortalize ourselves as far as possible, eph' hoson endechetai athanatizein - thus contradicting the usual Greek advice that as mortals we had better have merely mortal thoughts or aspirations, thneta phronein.16 Strange as his notion of the Unmoved Mover is, Aristotle's holding to immortality and his privileging reasoning as distinctively human seem familiar enough. It is salu- tary, therefore, to contrast a very different ancient culture - namely China - with its distinctive ideas about the gods, religious practices, and philosophical speculations. Among the latter we find a notion of something like a Scala Naturae in the third century ВСЕ writer Xunzi. Water and fire, he says, have qi&gt; Ж (which spans breath and energy), alone; grasses and trees also have life ( sheng , iË), to which birds and beasts add knowledge ( zhi , £P). But humans have qi , life, knowledge, but also an extra faculty, which makes us the noblest of them all. This turns out to be - not the reasoning faculty as in Aristotle - but righteousness, yi Щ: that is, a moral capacity.17 There are two main points about this view of Xunzi's. First, he does not extend the Scala upwards to gods. Elsewhere he is critical of many of the rites regularly directed to spirits and demons, which he thinks a waste of time and resources.18 But no more does he, in his Sea/a, invoke tian , :^C, heaven, for instance, conceived by many Chinese as an impersonal deity, though it is certainly no transcendent creator-craftsman. So gods, let alone the ancestors to whom most Chinese directed much of their worship, do not come into it. Secondly, the problem about using morality to differentiate humans is that, as the Chinese like the Greeks were very well aware, human views on right and wrong differ. That made it difficult to maintain that all humans shared the same sense of righteousness, or even the same sense of its importance. The moral sense has often been used to suggest not what all humans share, but what many humans lack. In many societies, as Lévi-Strauss (1973 [1955 ] ) already emphasized, the boundaries of the human stop at those of the society itself, though that is not just an idea about morality. Many have other names for other groups, but refer to themselves just as 'the people'. There is no need to travel to Amazonia or to Africa to illustrate the point. My own forebears, the Cymru, will do very nicely. That is a comparatively mild form of exclusiveness. But many stronger versions are widely attested. Many collectivities use their enemies the better to define themselves; they need their enemies in that sense. But that leaves open the questions of what kinds of beings those enemies are, where they came from and whether they are indeed permanent enemies (Vilaça 2010 [2006]; Viveiros de Castro 1992). Meanwhile the converse of the idea that certain humans are not like us - and so not human - is the equally common notion that many non-human animals are persons just as much as we are. That idea may be extended to what we consider inanimate objects, such as winds or stones, or even artefacts, such as kettles. Among many commentators who have explored this, Hallowell (i960), Howell (1984) and Viveiros de Castro (2009: i5f.) are exemplary. The problem of the concept of a person was opened up, in modern times, especially by Mauss (1938; see Carrithers, Collins &amp; Lukes 1985) and more recently has become, if anything, even more controversial (e.g. Strathern 1988; 1999; cf. Wagner 1991), and so too is that of a group, not just who belongs to a particular actual group, but the distinguishing marks of groups themselves, especially when they are relational, and indeed reversible (as well discussed recently by Vilaça 2010 [2006]). I shall be coming back to some of these issues shortly. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="6">834 G.E.R. Lloyd In antiquity, the Chinese mostly despised the alien peoples by whom they were surrounded, just as the Greeks did their barbarians who could not speak Greek and just made the noises ('ba-ba') that gave them their generic pejorative Greek sobriquet. The Chinese names for many non-Han tribes incorporate the radicals for animals, especially the dog. But against that, the Chinese term ren , l&amp;e the Greek anthropos , refers to humans in general, non-Han as well as Han, women as much as men. Xunzi's yi&gt; righteousness, is an idealization; but then so was Aristotle's logistikon , which he had no compunction in saying was possessed in only a very limited way by women and by slaves. But Xunzi was not the only Chinese theorist of what makes humans humans. In another third century ВСЕ text, the LiXshi chunqiu , we find that while what separates different human groups are such items as languages, customs, dress, taste, what unites them all is feelings, especially the need to satisfy certain basic desires.19 Speaking of two tribes called the Man and the Yi, the text says that despite their backward tongues, their different customs and odd practices, despite their clothes, caps and belts, houses and encampments, boats, carts, vessels and tools, and despite their preferences of sound, sight and flavour all being different from ours, [they] are one with us and the same as us in satisfying their desires. It is precisely because we all have the same basic desires that we are all humans, non-Han and Han, sage kings and tyrants. So quite different views were expressed within ancient Greece and again within ancient China on the question of what is distinctive about humans. There was no consensus, let alone an orthodoxy, on the subject in either society. But the issue of radically divergent ontologies has been opened up, especially by Viveiros de Castro's perspectivism and Descola's Par-delà nature et culture (2005), and, as I intimated before, I shall concentrate on them. Recent anthropological debate Viveiros de Castro introduced perspectivism in pioneering papers in 1996 and 1998, a set of reflections, so he tells us, on an indigenous theory extensively reported, but at that stage little commented on, in particular from Amazonia but far from limited to that area.20 According to this, 'the way humans perceive animals and other subjectivi- ties that inhabit the world - gods, spirits, the dead, inhabitants of other cosmic levels, meteorological phenomena, plants, occasionally even objects and artefacts - differs profoundly from the way in which these beings see humans and see themselves' (1998: 470). He then explained in a famous passage: Typically, in normal conditions, humans see humans as humans, animals as animals and spirits (if they see them) as spirits; however animals (predators) and spirits see humans as animals (as prey) to the same extent that animals (as prey) see humans as spirits or as animals (predators). By the same token, animals and spirits see themselves as humans: they perceive themselves as (or become) anthro- pomorphic beings when they are in their own houses or villages and they experience their own bodies and characteristics in the form of culture - they see their food as human food (jaguars see blood as manioc beer, vultures see the maggots in rotting meat as grilled fish, etc.), they see their bodily attributes (fur, feathers, claws, beaks, etc.) as body decorations or cultural instruments, they see their social system as organized in the same way as human institutions are (with chiefs, shamans, ceremo- nies, exogamous moieties, etc.). This 'to see as' refers literally to percepts and not analogically to concepts, although in some cases the emphasis is placed more on the categorical rather than on the sensory aspect of the phenomenon (1998: 470). Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="7">Humanity between gods and beasts? 835 Descola's ambitious fourfold schema does not just explore one set of data, but aims to provide a potentially exhaustive classification of ontologies, differentiated in terms of the notions of physicality and interiority they assume (Descola 2005). 21 Physicality relates to what is believed about bodies and physical objects generally; interiority concerns how one feels inside oneself, and beliefs about other persons or other inten- tional beings. The taxonomy proceeds by way of a contrast, in each case, between a view that stresses continuity, and one that emphasizes discontinuities, between humans and non-humans. Thus on the physicality axis, one view maintains that all physical bodies are essentially the same, while the opposing one stresses differences and postulates that what marks out different kinds of entities is, precisely, the bodies they inhabit. Simi- larly, on the interiority axis, the emphasis may be on continuity (the souls of all beings are the same) or on the discontinuities (humans are a race apart). This double differentiation yields a fourfold schema. 'Animism' (not of course Tylor's notion) is now redefined as an ontology in which other beings besides humans have spirits, but what differentiates them is their bodies. Interiority, selfhood, is common; physicality is what differentiates things. It is because the jaguar has the body that it has that it sees things in the way it does. 'Totemismi secondly, again redefined, is now applied specifically to an ontology where particular species of animals, plants, or other objects share with particular sets of human beings some complex of essential features that differentiates them from all other similar groupings. The unity or conti- nuity between humans and non-humans is assumed both on the physicality axis and on the interiority one. Intentional beings (human or non-human) and physical bodies (again human and non-human) form a continuous, seamless, whole. Thirdly, 'analo- gism' is the reverse of totemism, since it assumes discontinuities on both axes, postu- lating differences between humans and non-humans in both their physicality and their interiority, but finding analogies and correspondences across the domains thus differ- entiated. Descola sees this as the dominant ontology in both ancient Greece and China, for instance,22 and claims it was more or less universal in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Finally, there is what he calls 'naturalism', the default ontology of modernity, where physicality is unified, but interiority divided and discon- tinuous. This view insists on differences between humans and non-humans on the interiority axis with respect to minds and cognitive faculties generally (humans alone have culture in the strict sense), but sees humans and non-humans as linked by their shared physicality. We are all made of the same stuff. There are many aspects of these ideas that I cannot tackle here. I have elsewhere questioned how far 'analogism' will do as an overarching rubric to capture the diversity of views on offer from both Greek and Chinese antiquity,23 and one major problem for Descola certainly relates to how what he calls 'naturalism' arose from whatever it is imagined it developed from (analogism, principally), for on his account it was nowhere to be found before it came to dominate thinking in seventeenth-century Europe. Again in his new book, Viveiros de Castro (2009) identifies the various ways in which his perspectivism contrasts with Descola' s animism over and above the point that it did not form part of a comprehensive taxonomy of ontologies.24 He insists that what his perspectivism offers is not an elaboration or a type or subspecies of animism, but rather a concept, a theory, the basis of an indigenous metaphysics, or, as he puts it, a counter-anthropology, a metaphysics of cannibalism indeed. But setting aside most of the very considerable subtleties and complexities, I shall focus here on my question of ideas on the relations between humans and other beings. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="8">836 G.E.R. Lloyd On that question, the implications of these two - very different - contributions are clearly momentous. On Viveiros de Castro's account, humans turn out to be quite different when seen by spirits or by animals. (And that will differ again depending on whether those animals are human predators or human prey; and they may be both. The contexts change and they may be all-important.) But animals and spirits see themselves as humans; so what humans and animals have in common is not animality (as in Aristotle or Xunzi) but humanity. In Descolad schema, we have four distinct answers corresponding to the ontology in play, where humans are distinguished from other creatures either by interiority alone, or by physicality, or by both, or by neither. Whether we are or are not the same kinds of beings as animals, and if so, why, and if not, why not, are questions that receive radically different answers depending on the ontology adopted.25 A first conventional reaction to this (I mean from outside anthropological circles) might be flatly to deny the possibility of these alternative worlds. On one view of what we mean by 'world', there can only be the one, the universe as the totality of what exists, and we know how to investigate that, namely with what we call science. But that would be to miss the point. What is suggested here is that within this - single - universe, different beings, different animals, and also different members of the human race have such different experiences, perceptions, and ways of interacting with their environment that we should think of them as living in different worlds.26 The thought would be that conscious beings construct a world as they interact with it, though that is not to say that any such construction is purely arbitrary. Alternative ontologies Something of a digression is needed to clarify the philosophical question of the possi- bility of alternative ontologies, and for that I shall use an excursus on Greek and Chinese thought. At first sight, the usual Greek view about the constitution of physical objects seems familiar enough. The furniture of the world consists principally of solid, discrete, impenetrable objects that fall if they are not supported, that move in response to collision with other such objects, and so on. Some cognitive scientists indeed would claim that all humans have a domain-specific cognitive module that yields such an intuitive ontology, though everyone has to concede that modern chemical understand- ing complicates the picture and that is before we come to the paradoxes of fundamental particle physics. The cognitive universalists would counter that those are just theories and do not correspond to what experiments can reveal to be universal constraints on human cognition. But even if it were shown that children everywhere assume the same naïve physics, they, we, have to grow out of that, just as we have to grow out of naïve psychology (see, e.g., Gelman &amp; Spelke 1981), and indeed we do so in different ways, with differing views as adults, as the historical evidence confirms. We cannot experiment on Aristotle, to be sure, but in his physics (innocent of modern chemistry, of course) the primary category of being consists of substances that indeed exhibit many of the properties I have just mentioned. Yet, first, not all Greeks accepted such a picture. For the atomists in particular, atoms and the void alone exist, the atoms quality-less, indivisible, and invisible entities, separated by the void that ensures both plurality (it separates the atoms) and movement (the atoms are in con- stant motion: on their own they move in no particular direction).27 Moreover, secondly, the Chinese generally viewed the world very differently, as can be illustrated by the misunderstandings that arose when the Jesuits first arrived there Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="9">Humanity between gods and beasts? 837 in the sixteenth century.28 They interpreted Chinese physics as a botched attempt at Aristotelian elements. But the Chinese themselves spoke not of elements, but of phases. In their account of change, they focused on wu xingy SÍT, the five phases. These were named Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, Wood (I shall come back to the trans- lation of those terms in a minute). They were linked in two cycles, one of mutual production, in which fire produced earth, which produces metal, which produces water, which produces wood which produces fire to start the whole cycle off again. The other is a cycle of mutual conquest, in which fire conquers metal, which conquers wood, which conquers earth, which conquers water, which conquers fire, again to start the whole cycle over again.29 To the Jesuits, the issue seemed to be just one of four elements versus five; but that was to ignore how those phases were understood: it was to discount the possibility that the underlying ontology was quite different. The phases are not substances, but processes. In fact a Chinese text makes the point quite explicit.30 Shuiy 7jC&gt; the term conventionally translated 'water', is soaking downwards. HuOy 'fire', is flaming upwards. So where the Jesuits - and before them Aristotle himself, come to that - would have seen things , the Chinese saw events. But if Aristotle would have been baffled, another Greek would have been more sympathetic. I am thinking of Heraclitus, for whom the cosmos as a whole is an ever-living fire, kindling in measures and being extinguished in measures'.31 My thought experiment with the Chinese seeing fire, at least huo , as process and the Jesuits seeing it as an elemental substance is of course reminiscent of Quine's explora- tions of the radical indeterminacy of translation and of his and Kuhn's of the notion of incommensurable conceptual systems or worlds.32 Quine imagined an anthropologist in the field who in the presence of a rabbit hears an indigenous informant say gavagať. But Quine's point was that the anthropologist is not entitled to suppose that gavagať means rabbit, rather than, say, 'mere stages or brief temporal segments' of rabbits, the appearance of the rabbit, the way it runs off into the bush, or, alternatively again, not just a single rabbit but the whole of rabbithood in the world ( gavagai might be a mass noun, like gold or water in English).33 On the point that translation is always provisional, one may agree, and as it pro- ceeds, basic conceptual assumptions may need substantial revision (as Kuhn rightly insisted). But I would resist the further conclusion that has sometimes been drawn, that in such cases we may be dealing with worlds between which no communication is possible (which is the way that 4 strictly incommensurable' has sometimes been taken). That idea seems to me to be based on extravagant assumptions about the possibilities of mutual comprehension in the first place. That can never be perfect. But that does not mean that every effort at understanding is thwarted. We do not need to talk about communication in a foreign language to make the point, since even in English and among native English-speakers comprehension is never exactly perfect, if you compre- hend me. Anthropologists regularly remind us of the hazards of translation - as indeed do ancient philosophers. But I have yet to hear of an anthropologist who returns from the field announcing that she could understand nothing about the people she was studying. Thus far I have suggested not just that we should not set inordinately high, impos- sible standards for mutual understanding, but also that indeed history provides good examples where quite marked differences are found in what is assumed about what the world is made of. Alternative ontologies in that sense are there in the historical record. Rather than reject them out of hand as not making sense when they do not Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="10">838 G.E.R. Lloyd conform to our own assumptions, we should make the most of the opportunity they present to see things differently, indeed to entertain alternatives, hard work though that generally is.34 But now as regards humans, a further difficulty is suggested by those, such as Tooby and Cosmides and their colleagues,35 who cut through the problems and insist that, as the human beings we are, we all share not just our genes but also our basic cognitive capacities. The argument is that they were formed during the long centuries of human existence as hunter-gatherers in the Pleistocene and therefore common to the ancestors we all share. There are still plenty of disputed questions about human evolution from earlier hominids, including whether that was a once-for-all development. But strong as the arguments are not just for our shared biology, but also for the interactions of biology and culture, recently emphasized by Nettle,36 the problem I have with some evolutionary theses is that wherever we may have started, we as humans have now ended up with an altogether greater diversity of solutions to how to live - not merely how to survive, but the best social arrangements for life - than is catered for just by an appeal to our Pleistocene ancestry. Culture may reflect biology through and through: point taken. Sahlins (2008) even puts it that 'culture is the human nature'.37 But then our notion of biology has to take into account the complexities of our cultures. So that takes me back to anthropology, and to the alternative ontologies that Viveiros de Castro and Descola have proposed. Let me proceed outwards from the relatively uncontroversial to the less so. Discounting minor differences in the perceptual apparatus of individual human beings (some of us are tone deaf, others not, some are 'colour-blind', as we say - though that is an oversimplification38 - and others not), we may say that there are considerable commonalities in the ways we perceive: that is, in our perceptual apparatus. That applies to the ancient Greeks and Chinese as well as to the Achuar and the Araweté. Yet we know that other animals perceive things differently. Bats evidently navigate by sonar, so their sense of space is mediated by sound, not sight.39 But as regards many other animals (including jaguars), no one (I suppose) has enough information to justify a claim to give an account of their world that is anything more than a projection of their own ideas. I note that jaguars drink manioc beer in some parts of Amazonia, maize beer in others. But from the point of view of my discussion here, we can finesse the problem of jaguars' own experience and concentrate just on how that has been imagined, talked about, and used. We can see that to think of jaguars as forming societies like those of humans says something not just about a putative jaguar ontology, but also about us humans. It is certainly to adopt a very different attitude from the one we normally hold to the question of how humans relate to other beings, for it underlines that we are not the only creatures to have well-ordered relations with conspecifics, to behave appro- priately, to conduct ourselves with due decorum and respect. It is this opportunity to stretch our imaginations and rethink some basic assumptions that is opened up by the anthropological reports, just as I would hope it can also be opened up by exploring ancient Greek and Chinese thought. Descola's animism and Viveiros de Castro's very different perspectivism both see humans as living in a world surrounded by creatures that are endowed, like us, with selves and personhood. Descola's naturalism, by con- trast, cuts us off from the other animals, with nothing but stuff, what we are made of, to share. What is at stake here is, among other things, how we should live. Ontology here, as so often elsewhere, implicates morality.

Do we not know enough about animals to unmask those speculations about the animal world as a whole? Did I not point out that some species do (but by implication others do not) have complex social organizations? To say that all animals have culture is to make a similarly erroneous generalization as the denial that any do - though in both cases the issue revolves around what counts as 'culture'. That point has some force, as it seems to me. But the correct response is not to resolve the problem by legislating how culture is to be understood.40 What we need is not definitional fiat, but an understanding of the complexities of the question. We should acknowledge the limitations of our grasp of animal behaviour and psychology (the subject of so much ongoing research after all), and that means recog- nizing that some of our usual categories can be seriously misleading, not just the outworn dichotomy of nature versus culture, but also when we slip into talking about animals as if they were all the same, when we know perfectly well that that is a gross oversimplification, or when we persist in the use of a Scala Naturae in which everything else is ranked in relation to its proximity to us, at the top of the pile, though again the question has to be raised who we are. So it is not just a matter of acknowledging that there is still a long way to go in understanding other animals in all their diversity; we do not know enough about humans either, about the different ways humans have endeavoured to make sense of their environment and to organize their lives and their relations with friends, foes, and everything in between. We still have a lot to learn from anthropology, and maybe also from history, about how humans see themselves in relation to other humans and non-humans, about their - our - imaginations, hopes, and fears, and after all about our self-deceptions, errors, and delusions. We are not infallible, no more were the ancient Greeks or Chinese, no more are the Achuar or the Araweté. The trichotomy reassessed So I come back to the question I started with of where we stand and who we think we are. Many societies have used gods and beasts to arrive at an answer, though, as we have seen, the ways they have done so vary very considerably. Yet we may remark a persistent tendency to find some simple way of identifying what is distinctively human, Aristotle doing it with reason, Xunzi with morality, the Christians with an immortal soul, though the opposite extreme is represented by Descolad animism, with the claim that what separates humans and other beings is just their bodies, their coverings, their clothes, for that relegates all the differences to the side of physicality. Yet that desire for a simple ideal answer is repeatedly thwarted by the amazing proliferation of the actual answers that are given. The risks of schematization are obvious; maybe we should learn to do without the prop of simple answers. The two contrast sets traditionally invoked both have their snags. If gods are used, the trouble is that - as has always been known or at least suspected - views about them differ. Thaťs analogous to the point I made about using morality, in the manner of Xunzi, but the situation is appreciably worse, since faith alone (the sus- pension of disbelief) has to play such a large part if anyone is to claim that their own imaginings in this area alone are sound. Moreover, the insistence that there is just one true religion destroys the solidarity that might otherwise be suggested by having God create all humankind. If some are true believers, others infidels, some are saved, others damned, that tends to shatter any sense of the common humanity of humans as humans. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="12">840 G.E.R. Lloyd But if other animals are used, the first risk is that mirage I just referred to, of dealing with all animals as just animals, and the second is that they are often cited in further- ance of the idea of human dominion and of human uniqueness, and here what is undermined is any sense of solidarity between living creatures as the living creatures we all are - a solidarity that is not just a matter of biology, but also one of morality. But if both gods and beasts are difficult to think with, how do we use humans instead? In two ways, I suggest. One obvious recommendation, which does not need me to spell it out, is that in programmes of research in cognition, psychology, social behaviour, and evolution, studies of humans and animals need to be more fully inte- grated, more cognizant of one another, in some instances less blatantly Eurocentric, than has sometimes been the case. That is to avoid both the uniqueness claims and the types of global generalizations that I have criticized when the two domains, humans and non-human animals, are treated as polar opposites. But then the second tactic I would recommend is to turn the problem into an opportunity. We can and should use all the resources available to us, from anthropology and history, and, come to that, also from literature and art, to investigate how humans have got on with the business of self-understanding. To investigate what it is to be human is, among other things, to investigate the human propensity to investigate - to speculate, to produce cosmologies. That may sound too barren and self-reflexive to be useful; but I would disagree. We cannot do without ontology or values or notions of agency. So we had better pay attention to the gamut of possibilities our evidence throws up. This is not so much a matter of pursuing research in cognitive science, as exploring the plasticity of the human imagination, the range of human creativity. We need both to learn from the errors that we may be liable to commit - and there are errors that we must be prepared to diagnose even though that has so often been done out of mere prejudice - and then also to explore the imaginative possibilities that we may open up, difficult as that so often is. That has been the main goal to which my discussion in this article has been directed. NOTES The text of this paper is a slightly modified version of the Henry Myers lecture I delivered on 23 September 2010. 1 am grateful for the comments of the Editor and two anonymous referees and for points made to me by Philippe Descola and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro in correspondence. I hope to come back to the problems I broach here with further documentation and argument in a monograph in progress. 1 This idea of the triadic relationship was the product of the work of Vernant and his colleagues, Marcel Detienne and Pierre Vidal-Naquet, in the Centre Louis Gernet in the 1970s. In 1972, Vernant wrote the introduction to Detienne's Les jardins d'Adonis (Detienne 1977 [1972]), an introduction that was given the title 'Between the beasts and the gods' when the translation was reprinted as chapter 7 in Vernant (1980 [1972]). In the same year in which Detienne published that book he wrote an article entitled 'Entre bêtes et dieux' (Detienne 1972; later reprinted in a revised and retitled version in Detienne 1979 [1977]: chap. 3). Vidal-Naquet in turn wrote an article entitled 'Bêtes, hommes et dieux chez les Grecs' for a colloquium in 1973, later published in 1975. 2 Smith (2007) outlines the trajectory of European thought on the subject of human nature. Leach (1972; cf. Leach 1982: chap. 3) contributed a characteristically provocative study of humanity and animality, as did Ingold (2002), and Agamben (2004) is another subtle writer who has persisted in the quest for an answer to their difference. Most recently, the summer 2009 issue of Daedalus was devoted to the question of what it is to be human. 3 Aristotle, History of Animals 536b!. 4 See Cheney &amp; Seyfarth (1990); Seyfarth &amp; Cheney (1982).

While his official theory is that other animals do not share in moral or intellectual reasoning, in practice he allows them many other capabilities that involve calculation and learning from experience. Moreover, like most ancient Greeks, for whom the lion is the paradigm of courage, the deer of cowardice, and so on, Aristotle saw many analogies between human characters and those exemplified in other animals. 14 The only text in which Aristotle draws a distinction between these two types of reason is On the Soul III chap. 5, 43oaioff., 24f., the subject of extensive commentaries, and unresolved debate, in antiquity as well as in modern times. 15 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 117807-27. 16 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics Щ7Ьзз. 17 Xunzi 9, 16a: Knoblock (1988-94: vol. ii, 103-4). The question of whether or in what respects a moral sense can be attributed to certain animals continues, of course, to be hotly disputed. See de Waal (1991; 1996) on reciprocal altruism in chimpanzees, cf. Seyfarth 8c Cheney (1984) on vervet monkeys. 18 Xunzi 21.8: Knoblock (1988-94: vol. iii, 109-19). 19 Liishi chunaiu 19.6.2: Knoblock 8c Riegel (2000: 497-8). 20 Viveiros de Castro (1998: 484, nn. 2 and 3) itemizes the groups from Amazonia and elsewhere across the world in which perspectivism is present. There are two possible misunderstandings that centre on Viveiros de Castro's use of the term 'indigenous theory' in relation to perspectivism. Some, such as Willerslev, who offer a highly deflationary account of the perspectivai phenomenon, appear to have taken 'theory' as implying abstract speculation (opposing that to meanings that emerge from 'concrete contexts of practical engagement', Willerslev 2007: 94), but that is no part of Viveiros de Castro's interpretation. Nor is there, in that interpretation, any suggestion that there is uniformity in the lived experiences of the peoples in whom perspectivism is found. On the contrary, he acknowledges that 'people shift ontological gears every minute', though that leaves open the question of which of the presupposed, implicit, everyday context-bound ontologies is 'collectively foregrounded as conceptually worthy of reflection' (pers. comm., December 2010). 21 Descola (1992; 1996) had earlier offered a simpler triadic analysis of animism, totemism, and naturalism, before proposing his four fold schema (2005; cf. Descola 2009). 22 However, Descola (2005: 287-8) limits himself to only brief remarks on Chinese analogism. 23 Lloyd (2007: 144). In practice, Descola (2005) adds many qualifications to his four fold schema when he engages in a detailed examination of their historical manifestations, notably with regard to the various relations of prédation, protection, gift, exchange, and so on, that they may exhibit. 24 Some of the same Amazonian data receive very different analyses in the two interpretations. Descola's animist reading brings to bear his usual contrast between physicality and interiority - the body is a set of physical dispositions that predispose an animal to certain types of behaviour, while the common interiority shared by all animals allows communication between them. But Viveiros de Castro takes the contrast between body and soul to be one rather between figure and ground: the notion of the body, for many Amazonian peoples, he says (1998: 478, 481), already incorporates affects and memories (cf. also Vilaça 2010 [2006] on the Wari' concept of kwere-). 25 Viveiros de Castro (2009: chap. 3) elaborates the concept of 'multinaturalism' in the context of a contrast between it (and the perspectivism it implies) and the mononaturalism, but multiculturalism, of the domi- nant contemporary Western view. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 17, 829-845 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011</page><page sequence="14">842 G.E.R. Lloyd 26 Cf. Sperber (1985: chap. 2), who explores the possibilities in terms of what he calls 'cognizable worlds'. Cf. also Goodman (1978); Ingold (2000). Viveiros de Castro (1998: 477Í) put it that all living beings see the world 'in the same way'; what changes is the world they see. The things they see are different: what is blood to us is maize beer to the jaguar. 27 Yet Aristotelian qualitative four-element theory was opposed in antiquity not just by atomism, but by various versions of scepticism, which withheld judgement on all matters to do with invisible entities and hidden causes. 28 Gernet (1985 [1982]) provides a brilliant exposition of this encounter and of the misapprehensions on both sides. 29 Huainanzi chap. 4, from the second century ВСЕ, provides a clear statement of these two cycles (see Major 1993: i86ff.). 30 Hong Fan ('Great Plan') in the Shang Shuy or book of Documents (Karlgren 1950: 28, 30; cf. Lloyd 8c Sivin 2002: 259f.). The date of this text is variously estimated as between the mid-fourth and the early third century ВСЕ. 31 Heraclitus Fr. 30. Theophrastus was to criticize Aristotle's treatment of fire as an element, pointing out that it cannot exist without a substrate (fuel) and suggesting that it is always in a process of coming-to-be and is a kind of movement, and so should not be treated as a primary element (On fire III). 32 Quine (i960: 5iff., 7iff.) on 'gavagai'. Both Kuhn (1970) and Feyerabend (1975) have made much use of the notion that different cosmologies may be incommensurable. But as I argued in Lloyd (2004: chap. 4), while many key terms undergo radical shifts in meaning when one scientific paradigm replaces another, this does not imply total mutual incomprehensibility. Copernicus certainly thought he understood Ptolemy, as did Galileo Aristotle. Einstein has been thought not to have fully understood Niels Bohr, but that has not prevented commentators from making the comparison between them. There is, to be sure, no neutral, theory-free vantage-point from which evaluation can be made. But that does not mean that all discussion of alternative views is impossible. 33 Quine's discussion of the ontogenesis of reference, in particular his account of mass nouns (Quine i960: chap. 3), followed the standard practice among both linguists and philosophers of language of taking English as the prime target of analysis. If he had contemplated the sense and reference of Chinese terms such as shui ('water'), huo ('fire'), and jin (áè, 'gold', 'metal'), he might have paid more attention to the parochial characteristics of Western languages and been more alert to the limitations of the ontology they may presuppose. 34 Thus for Quine's indeterminacy of translation, generally viewed as a problem, we might substitute a principle of the open-endedness and revisability of interpretation - an opportunity. Cf. Ingold's plea for entertaining alternatives (Ingold 2008; cf. Ingold 2000). 35 For example, Tooby &amp; Cosmides (1992). Cf. Boyd &amp; Richerson (2005). 36 Nettle (2009) has recently underlined the interactions of biology and culture, emphasizing the differ- ences between 'evoked' and 'transmitted' culture. Runciman (2009) in turn provides a sophisticated triadic analysis of the interplay of 'evoked' (biological), 'acquired' (cultural), and 'imposed' (social) factors in the evolution of culture. 37 As Geertz put it (1973: 49), there is no such thing as a human nature independent of culture. 38 See Lloyd (2007: 19). 39 The question 'What is it like to be a bat?' was the subject of an influential paper by Thomas Nagel (1979 [i974])&gt; but that paid little attention to the detailed experimental evidence that was by then becoming available on their navigational skills (cf. Griffin 1974). Cf. also Nagel (1986). The 'what is it like' question has been intriguingly pursued in a wide range of contexts (e.g. Leach 1972: 11, what is it like to be a rat, and Agamben 2004: 39fr. on the non-communicating worlds of flies and spiders), especially, but not exclusively, in connection with the development of consciousness, as in Humohrev (2011). 40 The confusions surrounding attempts at the definition of culture were well emphasized long ago by Kroeber &amp; Kluckhohn (1952); cf. also Kuper (1999).

Les ontologies en question Résumé Où se situe l'humanité des êtres humains ? On a donné à cette question beaucoup de réponses contradictoires, depuis les temps les plus anciens. Ces réponses se concentrent souvent sur une relation triadique entre humains, dieux et bêtes. L'auteur fait ici un tour d'horizon de multiples propositions, des Grecs et Chinois de l'Antiquité aux récentes approches anthropologiques (en particulier celles de Viveiros de Castro et Descola) des ontologies alternatives. Il y a tout lieu de prendre au sérieux ces perceptions concurrentes de l'humanité, mais cela ne doit pas conduire à un relativisme radical ni même à l'abandon de toute possibilité d'intelligibilité mutuelle. Ces approches offrent, au contraire, des ressources pour explorer les questions substantives et réfléchir à la propension des êtres humains à exprimer ou présupposer des opinions vigoureuses sur ce que les rend, justement, humains. Bien que la biologie évolutionniste, l'éthologie, les sciences cognitives et l'anthropologie elle-même aient contribué à une meilleure reconnaissance de la complexité de cette question, nous avons besoin non seulement de ces disciplines mais aussi des travaux de la philosophie et de l'histoire pour peser les réponses potentielles. C'est dans cet esprit que l'auteur propose ici un commentaire interdisciplinaire de ces problèmes.
