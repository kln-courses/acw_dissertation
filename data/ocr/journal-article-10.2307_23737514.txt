<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECOLOGY OF THE MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION: AN INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW Harry Berger, Jr. I In a series of four essays, the first of which appeared in the Review of Metaphysics (September 1963) and the others in The Centennial Review (Fall 1964, Winter 1965, Spring 1966), I have outlined and exemplified what I call an eco logical theory of interpretation. These essays are attempts to define as a working hypothesis an idea of period imagination phenomenologically considered, and to apply this hypothesis to certain texts and aspects of the Renaissance. In the present discussion I shall consider some general tendencies of Chris tian medieval thought, amplifying certain remarks made in the second essay listed above. The ecological approach is grounded in the attempt to ap ply the methods of close literary interpretation to the study of cultural history. It began, for me, with a consideration of individual literary texts as externalized acts of mind, self or consciousness; the interpretive approach was subsequently extended to works not usually called "literary" in the narrow sense of literature as fiction, poetry or drama. The attempt presupposes some fairly simple if arbitrary hypothetical deductive assumptions about the relationships among cer tain mental modes of activity: "receiving" appearances, "making" interpretations and "positing" or "discovering" realities. (Realities may include, for example, such items as the atom, the earth's motion around the sun, another self, God and any number of relations-between.) The assump tions allow us to construct and infer a specific mental or cul 279</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW turai "ecology"—what a particular author presupposes as belonging to or initiated by himself, and what he presup poses as belonging to or initiated by the world surrounding self, mind or consciousness. This "ecology" is ultimately carried into the individual work, tested and corrected as part of the activity of close interpretation. The theory is pragmatic in that its ultimate aim is the elucidation of individual works. There is of course no such thing as a unit idea, a period imagination or a period con sciousness until someone, looking back, says there is. It is a pure hypothetical construction partly imposed on, partly elicited from individual works. Since the present essay is in troductory and does not go very far into any individual text, this caveat should be kept in mind throughout. The theory is also phenomenological, because it assumes that the objects of the mental functions named above (appearances, inter pretations and realities) are "created" by the mind through its intending them, and are continually transformed and revised in the dynamic of consciousness. Perhaps I should add that the theory is only in a very limited sense related to phenomenological criticism as practiced by Georges Poulet and some of the European critics with whom he is associated. Poulet's phenomenological criticism is not adequate by itself because of the ease with which it ignores the contextual boundaries established by the authors to which the method is applied. Poulet tries by an analytical overview of a writer's total work to identify not simply his central concerns and motives but their operation as functions of consciousness. He sees the total oeuvre as externalizing the author's spiritual profile or biography, although the "development" he traces is not that of a literary chronology; it is rather a reconstruc tion based on the critic's analysis of primary and secondary aspects of the writer's thought. The method is quasi-mythic in that it locates the beginning of the reconstructed sequence not in what was temporally prior but in some philosophi cally fundamental arché from which the externalized consci ousness ultimately derives its forms of thought and expres 280</page><page sequence="3">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION sion, its tendencies and its achieved shape. However brilliant the individual results of such criticism may be, there is some thing perverse about a method which, on the one hand, claims to describe an externalized process of consciousness and, on the other hand, often violates a basic premise of that consciousness: namely, that what it intended to produce, what in fact it did produce, was a number of discrete works, individual poems, treatises, etc., and not a single overarching image of itself. In every work which may be interpreted, an intentionality appropriate only to that work (and to its cre ator as producer of that work) exists and may be discerned; the "spiritual profile" may also be made to yield its inten tionality, but only as the sum total of all the individual moments of intentionality which it did in fact produce. Pou let's form of phenomenology might well serve as the prelude to a study of the work of an author or a period, but not as the study itself. With this amplification of my caveat, I shall proceed to the phenomenological prelude to the study of "medieval" culture. II A basic axiom of the medieval imagination was the familiar passage from Romans 1:20—"For the invisible things . . . from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being under stood by the things that are made." This means that the cos mos is to be seen in a dual perspective: it is itself incarnate reality and also an analogue of a reality "behind," "above" or "around" it. Phenomena are identical with things-in themselves, and things-in-themselves are symbols giving in formation about the reality of which they are the effects. Be lieving firmly in one sacramental universe, the mind could activate what Keats called its "negative capability" and en tertain both Aristotelian and Platonic feelings about the relations of visibilia to invisibilia: reality surrounds and bounds actuality insofar as God's infinite and eternal power creates, shapes, contains and sustains the finite cosmos. But the First Cause is also, by participation, at the core of every 2 8 l</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW created effect, surrounded by the actual and phenomenal veils which at once reveal and conceal this core. One dis covers God by going all the way out and up, but also, as Augustine made abundantly clear, by going all the way in and finding God, the Other, at the very center of self. In Paradiso xxviii Dante dramatizes this double perspective in the vision of the divine point surrounded by the nine angelic circles, a vision which—as Beatrice tells him—reverses the order of phenomenal actuality whose center is earth and container the empyrean. The symbolic or sacramental method whereby such a world view is created exemplifies a universal human tech nique common to the most primitive and the most sophisti cated thought: by performing operations on a proximate, viable and controllable model, one hopes to learn about or to influence (perform operations on) that to which the model refers or for which it stands. In any symbolic relationship there is an asymmetrical thrust, a tendency to move from symbol to referent. In more primitive and intuitive modes of operation, this thrust approaches the speed of light and is negated, since the referent may be fluidly identified with the symbol in what Levy-Bruhl has called participation mys tique. Here the power of the referent may be collapsed into the power of the symbol, or the two may enter a more com plicated relation in which the mind, construing relations of similarity as relations of causality, wedges symbol and re ferent apart. But this is merely the self-deception of magic in which self extends its "power" by denying independent otherness to the referent; causality proceeds outward from self through symbol. The great difference between archaic and Christian modes of symbolic operation may be briefly summarized by recall ing the following developments: 1) In archaic cultures of the Near East, myths of regeneration, the recurrent evocation of primordial events or archetypes, manifest an ecology which does not sufficiently negate the felt presence of the not-self; repetition is thus necessary not only to the form but to the 282</page><page sequence="5">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION activity itself, since problems continually recur and no mythic effort can be final. Hebrew monotheism moves be yond this method in separating God from nature and trans ferring magic from man to God—as in the opening verses of Genesis, where the divine magician's power is simultane ously word and deed. The direction of causality is consci ously reversed; human assertion of power is seen as the sin of disobedience, as stiff-necked pride; cosmic evil is justified as a form of divine retribution; what God does to man is also for man. Iconoclasm is itself a form of symbolic operation which emphasizes the gap between creation and creator, sym bol and referent. 2) In Plato's Timaeus the demiurge explicitly represents reason in the world soul, and the highly artificial treatment of "creation" is meant to persuade us that what is being de scribed already exists, that the myth of creation simply refers to philosophic exposition and discovery. Tacitly, however, the activity of the demiurge seems identifiable with the creative activity of the philosopher in this dialogue—for example, being without jealousy, he desired that all things should come as near as possible to being like himself. That this is the supremely valid principle of becoming and of the order of the world, we shall most surely be right to accept from men of understanding. . . . Taking thought, therefore, he found that, among things that are by nature visible, no work that is without intelligence will ever be better than one that has intelligence . . . and moreover that intelligence cannot be present in anything apart from soul. Plato claims for his world image and demiurge only the heuristic validity of a likely story, but this claim is the stylis tic negation of the contradictory fact revealed by the likeness of the demiurge to Plato. Plato, that is, must assert and deny the human source of causality in one and the same philo sophic act. The primary datum of the Platonic situation is the awareness that the philosopher must create what he dis covers, must confer symbolic value on objects in order to 283</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW posit realities above and beyond them. Otherness-as-rational, nous-as-other, can only be sustained by continual pressures of mind, by continual circling and shifting between the ex tremes of self-expansion and self-limitation. 3) In Plato it is still the human soul which confers sym bolic value on objects, and it is man whose effort of mind must hold fast to both sides of the symbol—its character as barrier and as communicant. In the medieval imagination, all this is performed by the God of Genesis and Revelations. This change can only have been effected by a return from Platonic scepticism to naive realism, by a strategic appeal to the projective tendencies of popular imagination. Such an appeal was made by Aristotle, who exemplifies, even if at first he only indirectly and partly influenced, the process which led from Platonic to medieval symbolism. Aristotle has been frequently castigated and occasionally praised for committing physics and logic to naive spatio-temporal cate gories. This commitment was deliberate and, whatever its effect on specialized fields of inquiry, it seems to have been motivated by general ecological considerations: he wished to make use of the intuitive or "natural" sense of otherness which accompanied the from-there-to-here vector of ordi nary perceptual experience. In order to do this, he had to conflate deductive premises, empirical inferences and naive observations. In De Cáelo I.3, for example, after demonstrating the eternity and circular motion of the quintessence, he appeals to common sense and popular tradition: Our theory seems to confirm experience and to be confirmed by it. For all men have some conception of the nature of the gods, and all who believe in the existence of the gods at all, whether barbarians or Greek, agree in allotting the highest place to the deity. ... If then there is, as there certainly is, anything divine, what we have just said about the primary bodily substance was well said. The mere evi dence of the senses is enough to convince us of this, at least with human certainty. For in the whole range of time past, so far as our inherited records reach, no change appears to 284</page><page sequence="7">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION have taken place either in the whole scheme of the outer most heaven or in any of its proper parts. The common name, too, which has been handed down from our distant ancestors even to our own day, seems to show that they conceived of it in the fashion which we have been expressing. The same ideas, one must believe, recur in men's minds not once or twice but again and again. The same motive impels him to read his arguments and in ferences into the appearances and to align himself with those whom he elsewhere censures for being uncritical. What is more real is now rendered visible but kept at a distance—the divinity lives literally in the highest place. By virtue of its visibility and its place, the objectivity, character and distance of perfect existence is controlled. The Platonic relation of image to paradigm is mapped on a cosmic continuum, while at the same time Aristotle maintains the Platonic method whereby the local model—the here of earthly life—is trans formed by sublation and correction to the there of eternal life: the heaven or upper place ... is unaffected by any mortal discomfort . . . for it needs no constraining necessity to keep it to its path. . . . Such a constrained movement would necessarily involve effort . . . and would be inconsistent with perfection. Hence we must not believe the old tale which says that the world needs some Atlas to keep it safe—a tale composed, it would seem, by men who, like later thinkers, conceived of all the upper bodies as earthly and endowed with weight, and therefore supported it in their fabulous way upon animate necessity. Aristotle thus establishes the possibility of symbol-referent relations based on a physico-spatial hierarchy with asym metric thrust from near to far, lower to higher, mortal to immortal. A symbol-referent relation does not in fact exist, however, since sublunary life does not "stand for" super lunary life, and there is nothing beyond (or in addition to) the physical cosmos for which it can stand. Aristotle has as yet no reason to extend efficient causation. Yet it is only this causal mode which implies purposive and creative activity. 285</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Only this mode entails the presence of a transcendent self there whose causal influence may be felt to controvert the centrifugal force of man's nous, to emanate from the pe riphery toward the geocentric self-here. The medieval imagination will posit God as primary effi cient cause, and will thus establish a spiritual referent, a Wholly Other, outside the cosmos within which he manifests himself. Later on, when Aquinas revives the Aristotelian distinction between the order of nature and the order of knowledge, it will be supported and transformed by this more dynamic interaction of divine Other and human self: asymmetrical thrust from symbol to referent, from self and world to God, is felt as a response—moral, psychological, epistemological—which mirrors the original thrust of God in the opposite direction, that is, mirrors his efficient causal ity as expressed in creation, incarnation, revelation, illumi nation, grace, salvation, etc. The Aristotelian and Ptolemaic spheres were later conceived as enclosed in the empyrean or fiery sphere, sometimes called the mind of God and "place" where the blessed live. This provides a kind of active staging area from which vectors of divine influence may be coordi nated with perceptual vectors. The opposition of earth and empyrean transforms the classical cosmos whose activity was bound in the circular motion of integrated but self contained spheres: superimposed on and cutting athwart this kinesis is the energeia of spiritual vectors which have some resemblance to Plotinian vectors of procession and reversion. On Aristotelian principles, the near, the lower, the mortal, the physical and visible are assembled in one group, the far, higher, immortal, spiritual and invisible in another, but the extremes are then conceived as interpenetrating in a contin uous graded manner which may be exemplified by Yeats's famous double cone. Any object is both real and symbolic insofar as it is the terminus of a creative thrust "from above" or "from the out side." Phenomena, as Augustine reminds us in De Libero Arbitrio, are existentially grounded in number: "Look at 2 86</page><page sequence="9">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION the sky and the earth and the sea; all things within them —whether they shine from above or creep below or fly or swim—have forms because they have numbers." From this the object derives a certain opacity, an intelligible structure which makes it the source of information about its cause. This very opacity, which resides in the concreteness of an individual existent, sustains the distance between symbol and referent: here, numbers are kept in place or turned through time, but there number transcends time and place. Pointing beyond itself, the object becomes transparent. But it cannot become too transparent, for then the referent would collapse into the symbol or would itself become a symbol of something beyond it. Separateness and distance must be affirmed at the same time that they are overcome, so that they may be continually overcome: the mind is kept in motion and desire only by being kept in place. As a medium, the symbol equilibrates the creative vector from God to man and the reflective vector from man to God. Ill As crystallized during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the cosmos projected by men and attributed to God ex ternalizes like a shell the form of imagination for which it exists. Thus it is not surprising to find the journey between self and God spatially mapped out, with the cosmos func tioning as the medium which both separates and communi cates. The basic astronomical model which Thomas Kuhn, in his The Copernican Revolution, has called the two sphere universe becomes a three-sphere world with material and spiritual, spatial and non-spatial components strangely interwoven: to the sub- and superlunary regions is added the qualitatively different empyrean which is the dwelling of saints and angels, the container of the spatial universe, yet somehow not itself spatial, being identified with the mind of God. The logic of projection may perhaps best be exempli fied in a characteristic treatment of the middle region: St. Thomas coordinates the three regions with three temporal 287</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW categories, the temporal, the aeviternal and the eternal. Aeviternity is a mean between time and eternity by which things not subject to change are measured. These things have change annexed to them either actually or potentially. This appears in the heavenly bodies, the substantial being of which is unchangeable; and yet with unchangeable being they have changeableness of place. The same applies to the angels, who have an unchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards choice; moreover they have changeableness of intelligence, of affections, and of places, in their own degree. (S.T., I, 10, 5, resp.) Aeviternity is above time but requires space; it is below or within eternity, because this can be predicated only of God, who is absolutely immutable, and who has no need to change his locality since he fills all places. The concept of aeviternity is another means whereby the spiritual can be woven into the spatio-physical, separated from any dependence on the subjective and temporal processes of human experience. For the aeviternal is really a kind of spatial category through which the mind envisages spiritual force embodied in spa tial form in such a way that it is at once apprehensible to mind yet distinct from it. The mind projects this relation of force to form in the cosmological assertion that there are angels "in" the spheres. Thus the progression time aeviternity-eternity is cosmographically translated to the progressions sublunary-superlunary-divine and elemental quintessential-spiritual. These progressions are themselves extensions of a basic dense-to-rare scheme. This means that the farther we move from man's position at the earthly center, the closer we get to "the simultaneous possession of eternal life," as Boethius put it. The farther out we go, the more real and permanent things become. If one moves far enough out along a straight line from the point at which one stands, out necessarily becomes up. The medieval thinker not only projects his categories of thought safely be yond himself in objective reality: he has shaped that reality into a physical and spatial model which reproduces his proc 288</page><page sequence="11">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION ess of thought, even his process of projection. The outward movement reflects two patterns of thought in terms of which the world is objectified and stabilized so that it seems given to man, an environment he did not create, therefore not subject to his own mortal limitations: i) A movement from time to space. It is a simple fact of psychology that we can see everything at once by translating temporal experiences into spatial form—a fact naively exemplified by the "many mansions" of architectural backgrounds in medieval paint ing and staging. It is an equally simple fact, especially since Kant, that temporal and spatial senses seem to be internal and external intuitions. In thus formalizing the movement from the first to the second, medieval thought creates and affirms an ontological counterpart to the mental process in which many particulars are translated into one universal, and universals are referred to spiritual essences outside the mind. 2) The physical gradation from dense to rare reflects a psychological movement through perceptual categories from touch to sight. Unlike tactile objects, the objects of vision are not material and do not require time to perceive. What is seen out there is at once safely beyond us and totally apprehensible by us. By moving away and avoiding immedi ate contact we affirm the wholeness and boundedness of the object, its otherness and transcendence; at the same time, we possess it much more completely in perception and thought. The basic methodological tool of the medieval imagina tion is a semantic device which St. Thomas' Dominican translators call antonomasia, or extension of terms, a device in which a proper or common noun expresses a more general idea added by usage to its original meaning. The purpose of this form of extension is to cut between strictly literal and strictly metaphoric interpretation, as Aquinas' discussion of the term "light" shows: In its primary meaning it signifies that which makes manifest to the sense of sight; afterwards it was extended to that which makes manifest to cognition of any kind. If . . . the word is taken in its strict and primary meaning, it is under 289</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW stood metaphorically when applied to spiritual things. . . . But if taken in its common and extended use, as applied to manifestation of every kind, it may properly be applied to spiritual things. (I, 67, 1, resp.) Strictly literal usage refers terms to perceptual experience, that is, to physical and psychic phenomena insofar as they are given. Metaphor is its contrary: originating in the mind, it involves a transfer of one part of the cosmic model to an other in a relationship which is understood not to corre spond to anything in the reality outside the mind. Its func tions are rhetorical, decorative, interpretive, heuristic. In extension or antonomasia, the reference of a term is trans ferred from one part of the cosmic model to another in a relationship which does correspond to something in the re ality outside the mind. Extend is an appropriate word be cause the reference is literally stretched through the appear ance and its actuality to the spiritual reality within or beyond it. Speaking of religious thought in general and late medieval thought in particular, J. Huizinga remarks in The Waning of the Middle Ages that "the imagination was continually striving, and in vain, to express the ineffable by giving it shape and figure. To call up the absolute, recourse is always had to the terminology of extension in space, and the effort always fails." But we must distinguish between the futile effort to visualize the ineffable and a more or less controlled failure, a deliberate blurring of the edges of the cosmos. Extension of a perceptual term like "light" meant that some thing of the physical was carried into the domain of the spiritual, and it was by not asking too precisely how little or how much that the mind preserved the linkage between phenomenal actuality and spiritual reality. The "physical" aspects of things like quintessence and the empyrean are, as noted above, crucial to such a linkage: concepts of rarity and purity, the belief in a subtle spirit-like stuff resembling ether, allow the mind to establish a volatile middle region between visibilia and invisibilia where the necessary con 290</page><page sequence="13">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION fusion between symbol and reality may be promoted. Thus the dense-to-rare and matter-to-spirit transitions, mapped from the earth to the outermost spheres, are fulfilled in the empyrean, where the edges thin away to nothing. The em pyrean provides both a luminous place containing the primum mobile and a "place" in the divine mind (or rather the divine mind as "place") occupied by blessed souls and angels. The term "place" is here used antonomastically, not metaphorically, and when St. Thomas discusses the sub stance of this "place" he is careful not to commit himself. He assigns it a brightness which is more than natural, yet still apparently perceptible to the eye: since the body of the firmament, though solid, is transparent, for that it does not exude light (as is clear from the fact that we can see the stars through the intervening heavens), we may also say that the empyrean has light, not condensed so as to emit rays, as the sun does, but of a more subtle nature. Or it may have the brightness of glory which differs from mere natural brightness. (I, 66, 3, ad 4) Antonomasia is thus a means of mixing physics, metaphysics, belief and dogma in such a way that the decision-making alternatives of literal vs. metaphorical interpretation may be avoided. As the above passage shows, an air of indistinct ness allows the mind to affirm the transcendence of spiritual reality and at the same time makes it difficult to conceive of this reality as extricable from its spatial model. IV As exemplified so far, the ecological idea of a period imagi nation is an integrated field which may be rationally de duced from a few simple axioms and then used to coordinate a large and diverse collection of data. Such an approach claims to make sense of what in special fields of study appear as weaknesses. The familiar defects of medieval physics, cosmology, epistemology, art and literary theory, etc., emerge as partial reflections of a single interlocking system of re sponses. Insufficient knowledge or method will certainly help 291</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW "delay progress" in any field, but insofar as the particular character or level of knowledge and method fulfills general ecological needs, it will have a positive cultural function. Physics of the Aristotelian type, for example, is not simply bad physics but also a major instrument in justifying an ontology based on perceptual categories. Whether or not Aristotle's physics indirectly influenced medieval physics be fore it was revived in the later middle ages, some such physics would probably have evolved; as we know, alternatives were available in Aristotle's time, but they had to wait for the proper ecological situation in order to be more than brilliant eccentricities. Science, philosophy and art are not only ab stractable as individual strands of activity whose histories can be isolated and traced through time; they are also collab orative strategies whereby a period imagination dynamically sustains itself in balance between the excesses of self-limita tion and self-expansion. Thus a period imagination, even though a hypothetical entity, need not be viewed as if it were monolithic and stag nant. So far we have explored what might be called the statics of the medieval imagination, which means that we have focused on a general set of responses, or, as in the pres ent instance, on a general ecological solution to problems which had not been so solved in previous cultural environ ments. Ideally, the medieval solution ought to allow the self to fulfill itself by transferring its nature, power and crea tive or interpretive functions to the Other like filings to a magnet. In practice, such a solution needs continually to be sustained and defended and drives a period imagination through a course of continual readjustment. An ecological approach to the dynamics of the medieval imagination would have to concentrate on two interrelated processes: 1) the increasingly sophisticated and intensified modes of "other ation" leading to sharper and sharper distinctions, even dis junctions, among ecological components (self, God, world, nature, state, church); 2) the gradual emergence of the architecture of the medieval world view into a system of 92</page><page sequence="15">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION articulated forms clearly made by and available to conscious ness. The relation between these processes is obviously dia lectical: the first is both the result and the counterpoise of the second. As this cosmos moves from the status of an in tuited and adumbrated given to the status of an interpreted and contemplated given, as it moves from the background into the foreground of individual works, the existence of the medieval imagination is threatened. What follows is, in very cursory profile, a model of one way in which the dynam ics of this movement might be approached. To begin with a general observation, we should note that the relations between popular and sophisticated thought in any cultural moment raise important questions for a study of this sort. Though social changes cannot in themselves be accurately registered by an ecological inquiry carried out at this level, their influence can be traced in the dominance or recessiveness of popular thought as stylistically reflected in any given work. Herein lies the value of the Marxist and per haps of any sociological approach to culture; the limits of such studies, as we have them, consist not only in their in ability to conceive causes, laws, etc., in terms of a sufficiently up-to-date methodology of thought, but also in their con fusion of background with foreground and perhaps above all in their ignorance of the techniques of literary interpreta tion. That medieval culture is often felt to extend from the Dead Sea Scrolls to the Divine Comedy suggests important facts about the style and history, the variety and unity of a particular period imagination, and one would not want to generalize this pattern by appealing to cyclical or other modes of typological interpretation. The socio-historical exigencies which gave rise to Chris tianity were not in themselves enough to develop it into a form of cultural imagination. The sense-certainty of evan gelical zeal, the simple immediacy of faith, the felt proximity of a transcendent Other—these had to be sublated and re flected into articulate self-consciousness by persons who not only underwent the primitive Christian experience but also 293</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW saw its value as a cultural form. It was not primitive Chris tianity in itself, its historical actuality, which lived on in the medieval imagination—the early Christians seemed often to consider themselves close to the end of time. It was the image of primitive Christianity as a germinal symbol felt to infold a new vision and system of existence. Perhaps the very notion of a cultural self-image is inherent in the historical self-consciousness of early Christianity, in its revolutionary conditions, its social orientation and all those other circum stances and beliefs which made "giving witness" so impor tant to the faith. The sense of racial, national and historical destiny easily communicated itself to individuals living within the orbit of Rome or of the Old Testament; their first task was felt to be that of asserting, defining and sharply distinguishing the new Way from the old; this was all the more urgent in that they saw themselves squarely within one or another traditional domain of biblical culture, as continu ing and fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament. Ret rospective analysis must be careful to separate an actual historical issue from its recorded image—for example, for such analysis the inquiry into the problematical relations between the Essene Teacher of Righteousness and Christ would not have the same importance as an inquiry into the way relations of this sort are generalized and dramatized in the A cts of the Apostles. Auerbach's classic study of the sermo humilis in the early chapters of Mimesis clearly exemplifies an analysis which isolates popularistic thought from popular thought—his book is significantly subtitled The Representation of Reality in Western Literature. That the various Gospels and the Acts reveal different interpretive phases and perspectives, all of them relatively sophisticated, is nothing new, but the impor tant point is the extent to which this sophistication deliber ately manifests itself in a coherent image of simplicity, an image which penetrates both the early Christian experience and the style in which it is rendered. The Gospels abound with references to the new semantics which Christ requires 294</page><page sequence="17">SlOU-i. ■■ MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION and is in process of creating: by toning down the stylistic level, one also tones down the appearance of human power and assertion, and at the same time enforces the gap between what is said and what is indicated, between man and God, the kingdom of Earth and the kingdom of Heaven. But this strategy also serves a quite different purpose, brought out most clearly in the use of parables. For the popular, agrarian and pastoral style is not used merely to reach the multitude of simple folk. On the contrary, it is meant to emphasize the difficulty, the exclusiveness, the need for initiation and proper interpretation, which attend the new faith and its kingdom. The disciples are radically set off from the mob, the new from the old, the pure in heart from the pure in ap pearance—again, though in a different way, the kingdom of Heaven from the kingdom of Earth. Once the difference is dramatized, the other value of the sermo humilis may be dialectically brought into play—the universality of its mes sage and welcome, the inevitable rooting and flowering of the mustard seed, the new as continuous with and fulfilling the old. This shift from exclusiveness to universalism is symboli cally portrayed in the structure of the Acts, which moves from the brief and uncompromising ministry of St. Stephen to the sustained and dynamic persuasions of St. Paul. The way of Stephen is a way of direct confrontation and judg ment—as it were, the way of single encounter aiming to re solve the issue in one blow. But it is not yet time for the martyr-hero: Stephen sees the glory of God and dies with a heroic Christian gesture ("Lord, lay not this sin to their charge," 7:60), but his words so anger the Jews that they begin new persecutions. The Apostles are at this moment of the ministry more useful to the Spirit alive than dead; they require tact and flexibility as well as courage and patience. They must spend most of their time dealing with nuisances rather than major issues—with such everyday problems of organization, for example, as that which led to the selection of Stephen: 295</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. (6:1-3) They must learn that the support of the Spirit is not an un conditional guarantee of missionary success, as Paul and Barnabas recognized at Antioch: "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of ever lasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles" (13:46). They must put up with their own petty failings and arguments (16:37 41), keep on the move, travel light and change plans at a moment's notice. They must expect their message to be easily misunderstood, adapted to more familiar pagan or Hebrew habits of thought, as when men are taken for gods (10:25, 14:11, 19:15, 28:6). Obstacles are equally posed by pompous, fatuous and pathetic figures like Simon (8:9-24) and the sons of Sceva (19:15), and by the petty self-interest of schemers like Bar-Jesus (13:6) and Demetrius the Ephe sian goldsmith (19:24). Above all—or more precisely, be hind all the aforementioned problems—the apostles have to adapt themselves to local conditions which vary from place to place and from congregation to congregation. This is brilliantly detailed in the narrative of Paul's ministries (13 20) preceding the climactic visits to Jerusalem and Rome; we see it in the flexible attitudes of James and Paul toward circumcision (15:14-29 and 16:1-3) and especially in the different levels and modes of response which Paul encoun ters in Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinth and Ephesus (17-20). Things gradually improve from Thessalonica to Corinth, then take a turn for the worse at Ephesus, which anticipates the more serious dangers of Jerusalem. It is only at the very end of the Acts, in the symbolic movement from 296</page><page sequence="19">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION Jerusalem to Rome, that the grander scope of the Pauline mission makes itself felt: in the concentrated enmity of the Jews at Jerusalem, in the sympathetic yet cavalier detach ment of high imperial authorities and in the final triumph at Rome, Luke allows us to feel once again the working of the larger plan, the thrust of the Nazarenes toward universal acceptance. The basic problem dramatized in the Acts, and the basic problem confronting the Church of the first three centuries, was that which the strange gift of tongues prefigured: when the Holy Spirit descended with cloven tongues of flame, and Galileans began involuntarily to praise God in all the tongues of the earth, we are shown at once a historical con trast to the divisions of Babel and a harbinger of universal triumph. The whole of God's providential plan is concen trated into this pentecostal moment. But this promise must be brought about by the voluntary and painfully slow ef forts of men, not by any swift and overriding intervention of God using men as puppets. The narrative of the Acts de scends from this symbolic peak into the everyday confusion, the piecemeal conquests and persistent oppositions of the early ministries, and reascends, as we have seen, only at the conclusion. Luke thus conveys the sharp contrast between the sudden power of the divine call—"a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind . . . filled all the house"—and the finite, step-by-step progress of the human response, or rather responses, for the divine seed is planted in individuals on whose diverse capacities its rate of growth depends. As John Marsh's translation of Ethelbert Stauffer's New Testament Theology declares: the Church which grows from this missionary activity can be neither a national Church, nor yet a world Church. It must be a Church for the peoples of the world. The most powerful witness to this is the story of Pentecost, the story of the gathering of the dismembered unity of peoples into a new unity, the unity of the Church of the peoples . . . what the story of Pentecost has to say to us is this: if the 297</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW same Logos ... be preached to the different peoples of the world in the same tongue, or if different Logoi ... be preached in different tongues, then the Spirit is not present. But if the same Logos ... is preached in many tongues, if the good news of the one Name under Heaven reaches each people on the earth in its own tongue, then the Holy Spirit is at work. . . . The differences between one man and another are not done away in the Church. ... In the same way the division of mankind into peoples is not something that ceases to be in the Church. The many differences between one people and another are not blotted out—on the contrary they are rather made use of. . . . This was a difficult middle course to steer, and it took some centuries to attain the kind of social and intellectual unity which constitutes what I am calling the medieval imag ination. Clearly this unity did not spring full grown from the head of Jesus and his apostles. There was a long period of search and change and confusion, a period during which any number of alternative solutions might have been offered to individual problems, a period also during which problems were dealt with individually and not from the standpoint of an attained and articulated "world view." If in the retro spective view of ecological analysis we can see where these efforts tended and why they tended there, it is essential to see that they proceeded for the most part blindly, through trial and error. This is of course a central function of historical retrospect: to scan the relatively blind, the apparently for tuitous growth of a world view for underlying criteria gov erning the particular lines taken by its development. We be gin, as above, with a static approach, which means that we rough out a hypothetical image of the period imagination, treating it as if it were a coherent and systematic unity en tailing certain consequences of thought and style. From this image we derive criteria applicable to the dynamic inquiry into historical development. Such criteria may be seen to be active at some level in the acceptance or rejection of various solutions, so that the dynamic approach may view develop 298</page><page sequence="21">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION ment on the analogy of natural selection: those solutions which most adequately meet the demands of the criteria are those best fitted to survive.1 From the character of the medieval imagination drawn above, one might expect some of the following criteria to be at work in the early formation of the Christian world view: i) Rules of faith, theories, doctrines, etc., should not look man-made either in character or in source. By character I refer not only to the quality of appearing intellectual or ag gressively philosophical, but also to the quality of appearing to be a projection, an analogy too patently derived from hu man activity and attributed to God; by source I refer simply to the quality of appearing like the work of an individual person. Here we see that it is not so much ideological content as phenomenological status which may determine the ac ceptability of an idea. From this the next two follow: 2) El ements of a world view are best presented in modes which emphasize the "fact" that they could not have originated in the mind but were given to it or discovered by it. Thus per ception and its analogies (for example, revelation, illumina tion, apocalyptic vision, etc.), sensation, intuition and super stition could be encouraged as inducements to naive or animal faith even—or rather, especially—when the element in question was a sophisticated interpretation. Here, as we have seen, lies the value of the appeal to popularistic style and the popular imagination. 3) Another use of popularism arises in connection with the criterion of source, namely, that anonymity be stylistically enforced by honoring (or appearing to honor) the majority will. Agreement and uni formity point toward the ideal of a universal response to the one true revelation of the one true Creator. We should then expect that solutions which seem more individual, which i This is not to force historical or cultural change into the mold of a literally organic theory. "Growth" and "decay" are applicable, if at all, only in terms of the hypothetical unity called "medieval imagination." The process of shift in which one set or sort of criteria gradually loses dominance and is replaced by another is simply change, not decline; it is only from a specially biased viewpoint that history gets better or worse before or after a certain time. 299</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW vary more from the consensus, would be discarded or else modified. 4) I described above Aristotle's more or less de liberate conflation of observations with inferences, and I think the same process is an obvious desideratum here, where it is essential to retain de facto control over interpre tation while giving it up in appearance. Thus, whether the distinction between theory and revealed fact, between specu lation and received doctrine, is blurred as a result of naive or of misguided thinking, the blurring itself is of strategic value. This is of course a corollary of the familiar require ment 5) that faith precede knowledge and that knowledge be employed to support faith. The situation of early Chris tianity called for a strategy opposite to Kant's "I have . . . found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith." So long as the assumption of the Creator as Wholly Other is a primary datum of belief, so long as ac ceptance of his revealed word is not problematical, men may feel relatively free to reflect and amplify what they have re ceived "in the mode of the knower." It goes without saying that the basic condition without which all such criteria could not be satisfied was the historical character of the Church and of revelation; the basic literary mode was that of historical narrative; the basic perspective was that of the engaged eyewitness so struck by what he saw and felt that he was compelled to make himself a medium through which the events and their message could be communicated; the basic mode of transmitting was writing, scripture, which helped guarantee the accuracy, uniformity and stability of what was witnessed, and which conveyed the sense not of something handed down from man to man and generation to genera tion, but rather of something which happened only once, in a certain fixed way, and having been recorded was available equally to all men and generations. It would be beyond the scope of this essay and the ability of this writer to trace in detail the influences of the above cri teria on the early development of the medieval imagination. However, some generalizations may briefly and conveniently 300</page><page sequence="23">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION be lifted from Edwin Hatch's great Hibbert Lectures which, though delivered in 1888, are still in many respects authori tative. The following passages at one point or another dem onstrate all the criteria in action: Thinkers of all schools, within the original communities and outside them, introduced conceptions which were afterwards discarded. One group of philosophers, treating the facts of Christianity as symbols . . . framed cosmogonies which were symbolical also, and fantastic in proportion as they were symbolical. Another group of philosophers, dealing rather with the ideal than with the actual, framed cosmogonies in which abstract ideas were invested with substance and per sonality. The mass of men were sick of theories. They wanted cer tainty. The current teaching of the Christian teachers gave them certainty. It appealed to the definite facts of which their predecessors were eye-witnesses. Its simple tradition of the life and death and resurrection of Jesus Christ was a necessary basis for the satisfaction of men's needs. Philosophy and poetry might be built upon that tradition; but if the tradition were shown to be only cloudland, Christian philos ophy was no more than Stoicism. All parties within the Church agreed as to the need of a tribunal, but each party had its own. Each made its appeal to a different apostle. But since, though many in number, they were teachers, not of their own opinions, but of the doctrine which they had received from Jesus Christ, the more orthodox or Catholic tendency found it necessary to lay stress upon their unity. . . . While the Gnostics built upon one apostle or another, the Catholics built upon an apostolic consensus. Their tradition was not that of Peter or James, but of the twelve apostles . . . there came to be a standard which the majority of the churches . . . accepted ... it is in the main preserved for us—with undoubtedly later accretions —in the Apostles' Creed. . . . The additions were made by the gradual working of the common sense, the common con sciousness, of the Christian world. They were approved by the majority; they were accepted by the sees which claimed to have been founded by the apostles. The result of the fading away of this distinction [between an original belief or historical fact and speculations about 301</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW such beliefs or facts], and of the consequent growth in impor tance of the speculative element, was a tendency to check individual speculations, and to fuse all speculation in the average speculations of the majority. The battle of the second century had been a battle between those who asserted that there was a single and final tradition of truth, and those who claimed that the Holy Spirit spoke to them as truly as He had spoken to men in the days of the apostles. The victorious opinion had been that revelation was final, and that what was contained in the records of the apostles was the sufficient sum of Christian teaching. . . . The battle of the third century was between those who claimed . . . that inspired documents were to be taken in their literal sense, and those who claimed that they needed a philosophical interpretation,—that while these monuments of the apostolic age required interpretation, yet they were of no private interpretation, and that theories based upon them must be the theories of the apostolical churches. In other words, the contention that Christianity rested upon a basis of a traditional doctrine and a traditional standard, was neces sarily supplemented by the contention that the doctrine and standard must have ... a traditionally authoritative inter pretation. ... A new principle had to be introduced—the denial of the right of private interpretation.2 Viewing these developments from the standpoint of 19th cen tury Anglicanism, Hatch saw as unfortunate the uncritical acceptance of the theory "that God never speaks to men ex cept through the voice of the majority," also the theory that "the interpretation of the divine Voice was developed grad ually through three centuries, and . . . was then suddenly arrested," that is, considered as fixed in the final form of Nicene theology. He was not entirely happy with the confla tion of facts or beliefs and interpretations. From our stand point, the very fact that such developments were relative and partisan and selective is valuable in suggesting the ecological necessity of growth in a certain direction. Whether "right" or "wrong" they reveal the working of a kind of natural se lection which, at this phase of cultural history, produced 2 The Influence of Greek Ideas on Christianity (New York, 1957), pp. 190, 312, 316-318, 324-326. 302</page><page sequence="25">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION what biologists call a "climax equilibrium": a balance of interests and tensions and interchanges making for a rela tively stable ecology—one which, as we know, lasted for many centuries. V The value of popularism as a style and strategy is obviously less apparent to "the people" than to those extraordinary and often unpopular figures who employ it. The image of early Christianity was fixed in the shape given it by the patristic tradition and preeminently by one man, St. Augus tine, who himself upheld the middle way. The influence of popular on sophisticated thought in this time is shown in opposite ways by the extremes against which he fought: on the one hand, the widespread millenarianism accompanied by political and secular irresponsibility which testified di rectly to this influence; on the other hand, the reaction of esoteric withdrawal from popular thought which led to the antihistorical excesses of gnosticism and Alexandrian spir itualism. St. Augustine realized that the symbols describing the mystical and moral realities were being confused with the things they represented. His great effort was directed to ward wedging apart the various levels of symbol and refer ent. He labored to convert magical or allegorical symbols into more limited yet more opaque and self-sufficient models —models whose relative independence would elicit greater respect for the value of earthly life while keeping it clearly distinct from the higher reality for which it stood. The early medieval imagination, with its axis determined by St. Paul and St. Augustine, thus offered the middle ages a mediated image of the primitive Christian experience un folded into the outlines of a cosmos. Except for isolated lu cid areas, focused in scriptural history and theology, this out line remained an outline, or better, a blurred unarticulated whole, for centuries. To the familiar social, historical and material reasons for this, one might add the fact that there was no further need to articulate the whole, that indeed the very act of structural articulation might diminish the crucial 303</page><page sequence="26">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW aspect of this cosmos, its givenness and otherness. Insofar as the cosmos, God's unified creation, was accepted as an as sumption, not questioned as a proposition, it could remain tacitly in the background of thought. The predominance of the encyclopedic and grammatical (exegetical, glossarial) traditions testifies to this: the products of such enterprises do not display any substantive or systematic organization be yond the superficial ordering required for rhetorical, peda gogical or ornamental purposes. These traditions are in style intrinsically fragmentary, discrete, because they depend on a unified system which is not problematical and is therefore outside the scope of human inquiry. Collecting, re-collecting, remembering, commenting, amplifying, abbreviating, rely ing on tradition—through these essentially passive and mimetic modes, the mind affirmed its self-appointed function as reflector, not creator, of its environment. The encyclopedias are aggregates whose principle of organi zation exists outside them, in the traditional world view and therefore in God's creation. The Summa Theologica, on the other hand, is a self-contained system—a highly articulated speculum which clearly reflects and is at the same time clearly distinguished from the Creation of which it is a mental analogue. The need for an apologia suggests the emergence of a problem, and in fact from the ninth century on the medieval imagination was to be continually exercised and modified by its awareness that the mind had consciously to restrict its power. Historically, this problem was coped with first through the symbolic or sacramental method, then, after the criticism which the realism-nominalism debate brought to a head in Abelard, through the more sophisti cated methods of scholastic analogy. As an example of sym bolic method, let us look at Hugh of St. Victor's description of the work of the first day: And at the very moment when light was visibly and corpore ally separated from darkness, the good angels were invisibly set apart from the wicked angels who were falling in the darkness of sin. The good were illumined and converted 304</page><page sequence="27">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION to the light of righteousness, that they might be light and not darkness. Thus we ought to perceive a consonance in the works of God, the visible work conforming to the tissue of the invisible in such wise that the Wisdom which worked in both may in the former instruct by example and in the latter execute judgment.3 The visible object or event is unofficially the paradigm of which the invisible is a copy. It may seem to modern readers that Hugh is giving free expression to his esthetic impulses, binding together the different levels of being by means of resemblances which are man-made and excessively facile. He does this, however, with the understanding that he is doing something quite different, something virtually the contrary of metaphoric constitution, for he believes the visible world to approximate a copy, "conforming to the tissue of the in visible" so closely that it can be used for the kind of point-by point revelation on which faith depends for its persuasive ness. The mind must maintain a delicate balance of power between itself and God: the more it explicitly disclaims its own creative power, the more God will have to do for it in order to sustain the equipoise between presumption and despair. On the other hand, as more is understood to be de termined from outside and above, the mind can find more justification for the magical exercise of its own powers: fan ciful metaphors may be handled as if they were theophanies. The creative imagination covers its traces by the concept of sacramental efficacy, that is, by the attribution of symbolic magic to God. "God's word," as Aquinas was later to put it, "operated in the creation of things, and it is the same which operates in this consecration [of the eucharistic bread] . . . here it operates effectively and sacramentally, that is, in vir tue of its signification" (S.T., III, 78, 2, ad 2). VI The weakness of the symbolic method lay in its tendency to assert the vertical thrust from symbol to referent, effect to 8 De sacramentis Christianae fidae, translated and quoted by H. O. Taylor in The Medieval Mind (Cambridge, 1949), Vol. II, 94. The entire chapter by Taylor, pp. 86-101, is an instructive primer of sacramentalism. 3°5</page><page sequence="28">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW cause, nature to God. The weakness is endemic to the method because man's apprehension of God through the symbolic manifestations of nature will be more complete as physical nature is less autonomous and human will less free to err. From a purely epistemological standpoint, it does not matter whether the vertical relationship is conceived in terms of Neoplatonic transcendence or pantheistic im manence: both equally support and justify the exercise of the mind's constitutive powers by denying to created nature any real autonomy, any self-contained system of causes and effects which can be coherently explored at the literal level. The universe which the symbolist imagination informs is essentially an aggregate of phenomena—individual things, persons and events—whose system is imposed from "above." And here the paradoxical quality inherent in all symbolic relations, and perceived by Plato, makes itself felt: "if a thing is made in the image of the Form, can that Form fail to be like the image of it?" (Parmenides 132 D). In the asym metrical and vertical movement, the symbol gives way to the referent, yet at the same time the character of the symbol rubs off on the character of the referent. The symbol is not construed as a model (in the modern scientific sense of the word) which has a structure and opacity all its own, but as a copy. Possessing less autonomy, it thereby gains greater power; its magical ability to focus the reality and bring it into view threatens to subject the reality to anthropomorph ism. The theophanies of Eriugena provide an example of this danger, as Richard McKeon's summary in Selections from Medieval Philosophers unwittingly reveals: "ideas are not built up out of images; rather images are intelligible by ideas. Reason raises us to a contemplation of Ideas which subsist eternally in God and which are reached without the intermediary of sensible things." The mind knows these Ideas "by theophanies, that is divine apparitions comprehen sible to human intellects." But these are equally sensible ap paritions, and if sensible things are themselves no longer needed it is because their phenomenal manifestations have 306</page><page sequence="29">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION been retained at a higher level which is "true and immutable and eternal." Later Augustinians like Bonaventure and Matthew of Aquasparta were to defend this position more rigorously be cause they were confronted, as Eriugena was not, by the Aristotelian world of self-sufficient natures and the corre sponding reliance on sense perception for the principles of natural knowledge.4 They held, as Gilson stated in The Unity of Philosophical Experience, "that truth being neces sary, unchangeable, and eternal . . . cannot be the work of a contingent, mutable and impermanent human mind inter preting unnecessary, changeful, and fleeting things." Yet Matthew can admit with Aristotle and St. Thomas that since things contain intelligible essences they are contingent and original causes of knowledge. For—and here he follows Augustine and Bonaventure—" the created truth is not other than a certain expression of the uncreated truth; and each created truth is true in so far as it imitates that exemplar." But so dynamic an intercourse between visible and invisible worlds was bound to cause trouble. Created truth could be explicitly believed to imitate uncreated truth only on the condition that the uncreated truth had been tacitly modeled after the specifications of created truth. Thus Plato's prob lem returns in the form established mainly by Augustine: if visibilia were justified insofar as they were effects and like nesses of invisibilia, it was necessary to keep in mind the infinite distance between the two forms of being. This problem had been placed in sharp relief by Hugh's contemporary, Abelard. He held against extreme realists that genera and species were fictions of the mind, psychological entities; and against extreme nominalists that genera and species must have ontological status as exemplars in the di vine mind. He affirmed the objective reality of individuals * See McKeon, Selections, II, 240-268, for Matthew's discussion of the disputed question "whether for the knowledge of a thing the existence of the thing is required . . . which he answers in the negative (see esp. pp. 254-258). See also E. Gilson, Spirit of Medieval Philosophy, tr. A. H. C. Downes (New York, 1936), pp. 231ft. 307</page><page sequence="30">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and at the same time denied the possibility that human and divine minds could be bound by a relation of necessary truth. The Kantian solution—retraction of phenomena into the mind—was inconceivable to the medieval imagination, so that Abelard was left with Kant's alternative (Prolego mena I, remark I), namely, that the ens rationis must be to some extent the product of man's imagination. Since from our point of view phenomenal forms are always in some measure the exemplars of spiritual and mental essences, the important differences in various medieval attitudes lay in the degree to which this was acknowledged or concealed. Wil liam of Champeaux's rose might be sublimated to some amaranthine garden, stripped of all irregularities and la beled a divine creation given directly to the human intellect, but it remains a mental construct whose definition "imitates" an imagined visual model. The practical problem focused by Abelard was that extreme realism laid phenomena open to question and allowed one to feel that what the mind ab stracted was perhaps more real than what was given to it from the outside. When Abelard wants to relate the general idea to its par ticulars he relies on a visual paradigm which may suggest to us how much the structure of "higher" reality was actually controlled by sense experience: "to show the nature of all lions, one picture can be made representing what is proper to no one of them." This reminds me of the French archi tect Villard de Honnecourt's famous drawing of a lion (c. 1235) which, though copied "al vif," is still sufficiently schematic to represent a lion rather than to resemble this lion. Though philosophic and artistic methods move in op posite directions, they tend to reflect, as in facing mirrors, a common set of assumptions. To the medieval artist, E. H. Gombrich writes in Art and Illusion, "the schema is the image; to the post-medieval artist, it is the starting point for corrections, adjustments, adaptations, the means to probe reality and to wrestle with the particular." And he suggests that the schematic style of the former is due not simply to 308</page><page sequence="31">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION technical inadequacy but to a belief in the superior reality of generic or specific forms. Where the post-medieval artist asks "How shall I render this lion as I see it, or have seen it, in nature?," the medieval artist corrects the particular image to approximate the schema, and so far as the practical result is concerned the motive may be indifferently stylistic or symbolic. In a similar fashion, we may see the medieval philosopher as sublating a phenomenal image to a schema or blueprint in terms of which to construct the form com mon to all members of the class but proper to no one of them. As Abelard puts it, the distinction between particular and universal may well be reducible to that between two kinds of visualization. The first is based on the reality given in perceptual experience, the second on a mental construct which Abelard at one point calls a fiction. Abelard's critique jeopardized symbolic method, and his contemporaries were made aware of the danger by his Sic et Non, which affirmed the validity of Scriptural phenomena while implying that the whole corpus of tradition and doc trinal interpretation was no better than arbitrary opinion. The fact that both Abelard and Hugh accepted the reality of phenomena, yet approached them in opposite ways, sug gests the insufficiency of the aggregate-view underlying sym bolic method. The mind could not adequately defend itself against the possibility that it might discover the extent to which the spiritual forms attributed to God were constituted by itself. And the corollary is equally dangerous: that God may have created a phenomenal actuality, a Nature, which was not full-bodied and independent, not an esthetically satisfying system of organic natures. For how, Gilson asks in Unity as he describes the "theologism" of the Franciscans, How could anything be natural, in a doctrine where each particular being is but a mystical symbol of its Creator? In common sense, we can form the general idea of Tree, because there really are such things as trees; but in a doctrine wherein the truth of our judgments rests ultimately with the divine light, no number of particular observations could ever yield the necessary essence that we call tree. 309</page><page sequence="32">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The shift from symbolic to analogical method is in es sence a shift from an aggregate to a system-view of the world; this is produced by a kind of braking mechanism through which the mind reduces the velocity of asymmetrical thrust by affirming, allowing or justifying a greater measure of self sufficient reality to the physical model. The early stages of the shift should probably be attributed to the school of Chartres whose members, as A. C. Crombie says in Medieval and Early Modern Science, tried to explain the universe "in terms of natural causes, after the dissatisfaction with the at tempt to interpret it merely in terms of moral symbols." They accommodated the cosmology of the Timaeus to the de mands raised by the gap between observed data and the ac count of creation in Genesis, thereby assigning the intrinsic rationality of the Greek system to God. But the full articula tion of the analogical method had to await St. Thomas' re sponse to the crisis produced by the invasion of Aristotle. Plato posed no real problem because his work was trans mitted in a cosmological fragment known to the Middle Ages chiefly through late antique interpreters who partly and inconsistently systematized what in the Timaeus was only tentative. But Aristotle invaded western culture as a developed system in one man's name, a system whose threat to divide authorship was increased by the imprimatur of Averroes. The Thomistic method of analogy was thus de veloped to cope with two cultural problems which were virtually contrary in character; the threat of univocity of fered by symbolic method and the threat of equivocity of fered by Aristotelian physics. Theoretically, the method of proportional analogy entails similarity or identity in relations, difference in terms. But, as Edwyn Bevan states in Symbolism and Belief, the familiar example of the relation between human and divine attri butes suggests that the theoretical ideal cannot easily be actualized in medieval thought: if you were to call God wise univoce, that is, in the same sense in which a man is wise, you would fall into the pit 31O</page><page sequence="33">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION of anthropomorphism: if you were to call God wise aequivoce, that is to say, if by wisdom in the case of God you mean an unknown something not parallel in any respect with what is ordinarily understood by "wisdom," you fall into the pit of agnosticism. . . . You cannot say what "wisdom" means in the case of God, but you can say that there is something which is to God what wisdom, when a man has it, is to the being of a man, that there is something which is to God what being or existence is to a man, something which is to God what goodness is to a man; and so on. Yet since God is perfectly simple, He can have no real plurality of attributes. The analogy is only sustained by the antonomastic blurring which allows similarity or identity of terms to be asserted implicitly while it is denied explicitly. Given the tradi tional, cosmological and theological exigencies of medieval Christian thought, the strict demands of the method cannot be met. In Aquinas' case the problem is further complicated by the fact that he is fighting a rearguard action. He does not justify Aristotle for Aristotle's sake; rather he enlists this justification in the service of his defense of tradition, and in this case the tradition means the symbolic or sacramental method. The logic of symbolic method finds a more natural and consistent defense in the elaborate network of ontologi cal modes of resemblance devised by St. Bonaventure, but it is in St. Thomas that the pressures of modern thought are most fully recognized. From a historical point of view, one of St. Bonaventure's more significant achievements, exemplified best in the Itin erarium, is his dialectical interweaving of two itineraries— the older Neoplatonic-Augustinian path of inward illumina tion sustained and refined in the mystical theologies of mo nastic culture; and the more modern or scholastic cosmo logical via developed through a revival of Ptolemaic and Aristotelian science. A major difference between St. Bona venture and St. Bernard (or St. Augustine) is that the former had these two ways clearly before him with their parallels and antitheses manifest. In the per of natural knowledge and the in of mystical knowledge, the first dead 3 1 1</page><page sequence="34">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ing through psychology to ontology, the second through psy chology to ecstasy, the first leading through cosmic effects to the First Cause, the second leading through the human per son toward the divine Persons, St. Bonaventure converted two massive bodies of culture into a supple spiritual dy namics. In this he was both pressed and aided by the fact that a problem existed in articulate form: the problem, namely, that God seemed to have divided man's attention by offering two different paths to Himself (Breviloquium, II.xi.2-6), one outward through macrocosmic traces, the other inward through personalistic images. Insofar as both were creative enterprises of the mind, the will to cosmological exploration and the will to interior illumination were not entirely com patible. For St. Augustine, of course, the problematic divi sion did not exist; moving away from the sparse traces of independent and systematic Greek science, he could validate phenomena and allow for the possible changes which further scientific investigation might require in Scriptural exegesis. For St. Bernard, the threat did not come from cosmology but from dialectics: his own per-in antithesis—ibi accessus vs. hie ingressus (In Cant. Cant., 23.14)—isolates and coordinates two kinds or degrees of knowledge. For St. Bonaventure the corporalis mundi machina tota (Brev. Il.iii.i) exists not merely in and for itself but chiefly in itself and for man. Man as an earthly and generated crea ture, also as a fallen creature—especially if he has not yet felt the clamor orationis—man exists in the dense and opaque center of the cosmos among the other creatures of the six days' work. Raying signs and influences toward the center, this world is his temporary home until he arrives at the heavenly home in body as well as soul (Brev. II.iv.5). But in sofar as the cosmic machine is a trace and man an image, man's place is not at the earthly center but in the middle of the hierarchy, a medium who separates and unites physical and spiritual nature. Here the cosmos functions as the base of a vertical cylinder pinched in at the middle (Yeats's double cone once more, silhouetted and standing on end). Man de 3 1 2</page><page sequence="35">MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION fines himself by locating his place in these two orders, as a generated mortal creature in the first, as a governing and aeviternal spirit in the second. But the relation between these two orders is itself reversible, depending on how it is approached: if from the standpoint of consciousness, of the inner ascent, then the cosmic order is included or "con tained" within the hierarchic order as one of its phases; if from the strictly objective or ontological standpoint, then the inner ascent is contained within earthly experience and is fulfilled by another, actual ascent of soul, then of body, after death. In the first context, directional terms like supra and sursum are opposed to infra understood as extra and do not, therefore, mean "overhead." In the second context, after the spherical cosmology became a fact for cultural con sciousness, supra and sursum, do involve a spatial movement up and out from the center toward a particular locus, the empyrean. The itinerarium mentis is crucial to the itinera rium hominis, but the former means little if the latter is not literally believed. 3 i 3</page></plain_text>
