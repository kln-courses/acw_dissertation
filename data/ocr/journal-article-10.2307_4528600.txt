Brill, Leiden POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA: OBSERVATIONS ON THE ALMANACS OF SHUI-HU-TI BY MU-CHOU POO Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, Taipei I. Introduction Ever since the discovery of the 1156 bamboo slips from a Ch'in tomb (c. 220 B.C.) at Shui-hu-ti, Hupei province, in 1975, scholars of early Chinese history have been busy examining the rich mate- rial contained in the texts. A rough estimation of the number of articles and books on the subject published between 1975 and 1989 amounts to about 700.' The large majority of these works is devoted to elucidating the legal and socio-economic significance of the various legal documents and law books included in the materials.2 Only a fraction of the studies, about thirty or so, deal with religious aspects in one way or another. In fact, about one-third of the bamboo slips (425) are religious in nature, consisting of a particu- lar text (in two versions) with the title "Daybook" (Jih-shu H X )-a work more or less the equivalent of an "almanac" in the West.3 The The main publication is Yiin-meng Shui-hu-ti Ch'in-mu pien-hsieh tsu @ltPhtg8 , Yun-meng Shui-hu-ti Ch'in-mu f (Peking: Wen-wu, 1981).

Only in the mid-1980s did scholars begin to pay more attention to this "Day- book", a collection of various "treatises" concerning the auspi- ciousness of the days and hours for the daily activities of peasants, local officials and merchants. The jih-shu of Shui-hu-ti (henceforthJS) is replete with difficult words and phrases. Some early studies, quite naturally, are devoted to the explanation of individual terms or expressions in order to elucidate the basic meaning of the text. This kind of philological study, of course, is highly technical and requires both erudition and patience. There is no doubt that more such studies are needed to make the text easy to read throughout.4 In the meantime, however, there is no reason why one should not try to investigate some general issues, such as economic, social and political situations, marriage and family relationships, and, above all, divination and religious beliefs. This paper offers an examination of the last issue mentioned. I will first review some recent publications, and then offer my own observations. II. The Religion of the Ch'in People So far, most of the studies related to the JS have been published by Chinese scholars. Although many of them touch upon the problem of religion, only a few focus on this special topic.5 One introductory study of the JS points out that the religion of the Ch'in people, as reflected in this text, consisted of "supersti- tious taboos" and "belief in ghosts and gods", and that "the religion of the ghosts and gods of the Ch'in society was still rather primitive. Because it was primitive, ghosts and men were similar in and structural analysis of this text, without much discussion of the actual content, is provided by M. Kalinowski, "Les traites de Shuihudi et l'hemerologie chinoise a la fin des Royaumes Combattants", T'oungPao LXXII (1986), pp. 175-228.

However, due to the introductory nature of the article, the points raised are not fully discussed. The idea that the religion of the Ch'in people was "primitive" is further developed in an article by Li Hsiao-tung and Huang Hsiao- fen published in 1987.7 The authors discuss the concepts of kuei R (ghost) and shen i* (god, spirit) in the JS, and come to the conclusion that "the religious system of the Ch'in people was immature and underdeveloped; it preserved many characteristics of primitive religion, while it failed to develop satisfactorily the religious ethics which a civilized age should have" (p. 58). The Ch'in people, according to the authors, "lacked any rich imagina- tion in their perception of ghosts and gods" (p. 62). For them, the ghosts were creatures with psychological and emotional needs simi- lar to those of human beings. The gods, instead of being a power in regulating the social order and providing ethical standards, were no more than numinous forces in nature, dispensing fortune or catastrophe at their whim (p. 60, 62). In other words, theJS lacked any theoretical explanation concerning the principles on which the behaviour of the gods and ghosts was based. What interested the Ch'in people (as reflected in the JS) was not the propagation of benevolence and moral justice, nor was it the performance of ritual and music; it was sundry mundane concerns such as war, business, agriculture, marriage, childbirth, sickness, or death. Moreover, the nature of the days, auspicious or otherwise, was pre-determined. There was no need, therefore, to make any personal judgment if one believed in the efficacy of the JS. This implies that its users shared a kind of utilitarian mentality, which was in tune with the supposedly practical and utilitarian nature of the Ch'in cultural tradition.8 It is appropriate to say that in thejS the gods and ghosts, who do not seem to be guarantors of justice and morality, are unpredict- able and often dangerous. However, it is problematic whether one 6 Jih-shu yen-tu-pan FH , "Jih-shu-Ch'in wen-hua ti i-mian ching- tzu" FH -&lt;:Lk J i, Wen Po -PCA, 1986:5, pp. 8-17. 7 Li Hsiao-t-ung k and Huang Hsiao-fen Xg, "Ts'ung Jih-shu k'an Ch'in-jen kuei-shen-kuan chi Ch'in wen-hua t'e-cheng" E tg1,&amp;t-5G4ttm, Li-shihyen-chiu, ,7_f 1987:4 pp. 56-63. 8 See note 52 below.</page><page sequence="4">MU-CHOU POO should agree that the "religion of the Ch'in people" was "primi- tive", and that the "utilitarian nature"of the religious concepts in theJS reflected the Ch'in cultural tradition. Without first clarifying the definition of "religion", the use of expressions such as "imma- ture" or "underdeveloped" cannot really explain the "religious system" of the Ch'in, or of any other people for that matter. Moreover, without further investigating the social background of the users of the JS, one cannot accept it unquestionably as a document reflecting only Ch'in culture or ideology, even though it was found in a Ch'in tomb. The tomb owner Hsi H, one should recall, was a local official of the Nan Commandery (Nan chiin ), i.e., a territory annexed by the Ch'in from the state of Ch'u only about fifty years before. To speak of a "Ch'in tomb", therefore, may not be entirely adequate in terms of its cultural background.9 In discussing this problem, Li and Huang compare the religious concepts inJS with those of the Ch'u-tz'u uR and conclude that the JS betrays characteristics of the Ch'in culture.10 Yet, even if this conclusion bears some truth, to compare works of such a different nature and coming from such different social strata is methodologi- cally questionable. Nor are these fundamental issues the concern of Wang Kuei- chiin and Tou Lien-jung, the authors of two other recent articles." The term "Ch'in people" is frequently used in referring to the users ofJS without further explication of their cultural and social back- ground. Even when these problems are acknowledged and the users of the JS are defined as the "middle-lower stratum" of Ch'in society,12 the terms "Ch'in people" and "Ch'in culture" are still freely used in denoting the users and their culture. Moreover, no attention is given to the question of the differences or similarities among the "middle-lower stratum" of Ch'in culture and that of 9 For an archaeological assessment of the "cultural background" of his tomb, see Yiin-meng Shui-hu-ti Ch'in-mu, chapter 3. The conclusion of this chapter is rather inconclusive concerning the cultural background as the tomb possesses both Ch'in and Ch'u characteristics. In a brief article, Li Hsiieh-ch'in ? iti also alludes to the material in the JS as reflecting a mixture of Ch'in and Ch'u traditions. ("Shui-hu-ti Ch'in-chien Jih-shu yii Ch'u Ch'in she-hui" Jfi*;Pt H ~ ~ j~IHi*~, Chiang Han k'ao-ku 1:gt 1985, 4, pp. 60-64.) 10 Li Hsiao-tung and Huang Hsiao-fen, Li-shihyen-chiu 1987, 4, pp. 56-63. See below for further discussions on this point in relation to other jih-shu.

In other words, they do not consider whether the social and cultural background of the JS sufficiently bears out the claim that it represents Ch'in culture. Indeed, some other scholars actually consider that the materials in theJS reflect, at least partially, the culture of Ch'u rather than Ch'in. We shall return to this point later. Some Japanese scholars have discussed the JS in the vein of textual studies. For example, Kud6 Motoo, in a series of articles, examines various problems concerning the astronomical divination method,'4 the concept of the Five Phases in theJS,'5 the protective god of travel,16 and Ch'in rule in Ch'u territory.17 Yoshinami Takashi also discusses some parts of theJS by tracing their possible successors in the Han dynasty.18 These studies are informative and useful, but their interests are predominately text-critical and philo- logical, and they do not really concentrate on religious issues. In the West, Donald Harper has published an extensive philolo- gical study of the relationship between one particular section of the JS, known as Chieh J, and later Chinese demonographical litera- ture. He characterizes Chieh as "a manual of demon lore which was 13 Besides the problems discussed above, the aforementioned works also abound with terms that cannot be defined precisely. For example, the religion of the Ch'in people, as well as the religion reflected in the JS, are described as "worship of one god, observance of animism" (i-shen ch'ung-pai, fan-ling hsin-yang --TFq , ' {21:[ffp ), if one may so translate. What is this "worship of one god"? Is it monotheism, monolatry, or something else? The authors claim that "observ- ance of animism" is "not worshipping more than one god", and that the "Red Emperor" (Ch'ih-tiliW) (JS no. 1028, henceforth only numbers are quoted) was only another name of "The Supreme Emperor" (Shang-huang iL), that is, the sun god. However, the JS mentions many more "gods", such as the "earth god" (t'u-shen±it) (764 ver.), or the "god of the ladle of earth" (ti-shao-shen't+ikt) (758 ver.), which cannot possibly all represent one god. 14 "Nijuhachi shuku uranai (1) Chinkan Nisho sakki"-tA-/,rt -- f aHIJg, Shiteki, 8 (1987), pp. 30-44. 15 Suikochi Shinbo chikukan Nisho ni tsuite." 16 "Umorete ita koshin-shutoshite Shinkan Nisho ni yoru" i t -_ t ( 4 7 4 i-t L U, , T FH 75 Toyubunka kenkyujo kiyo X-&lt;:-;FI f igeo no. 106 (1988), pp. 163-207. 17 "The Ch'in Bamboo Strip Book of Divination (Jih-shu) and Ch'in Legalism", Acta Asiatica , 58 (1990), pp. 24-37. 18 See Yoshinami Takashi ft[], "Unbo Shinkan Nissho shoron" ZW EtH \ ,,in .Yokoyama Hide ;Ll* and Teraji Jun Pt* , eds., Chugoku shakaishi no shoso6 rflgt*_t fH (Tokyo: Keiso shobo, 1988), pp. 1-51. 229</page><page sequence="6">230 MU-CHOU POO intended for use by the believers".'9 He briefly mentions some of the spirits described in the Chieh, but without further discussing their nature, although, judging from his introductory remark, it is rather clear to him that: The ancient Chinese conception of the spirit world did not tend towards making a categorical division of the spirits into the good and the evil or the gods and the devils. The general sentiment was, however, that the ghosts of the dead and the sundry spirits who inhabited the terrestrial realm were a hazard to humankind.20 Further investigation of the entire JS is obviously needed to strength- en or refute this point. Michael Loewe also has contributed an introductory article concerning the JS. He points out various later documents that deal with subjects similar to those in theJS. Con- cerning the religious significance of the text, Loewe singles out "the mythology" surrounding the Ch'ien-niu *4t (i.e. the Cowherd) and the Chih-nu Q (the Weaver), and "hungry ghosts". The latter may have some connection with the Buddhist concept of ghosts.2' Finally, Marc Kalinowski has examined the internal orga- nization of the JS by regrouping the various sections into several systems. He pays particular attention to problems related to the calendars and astronomical materials.22 None of these scholars, however, has made a detailed examination of the cultural back- ground of the JS. A fresh look at the nature of the "religion" reflected in the JS, as well as an examination of the socio-cultural background of this document, are therefore needed in view of some of the issues raised by these recent studies. III. Ghosts, Spirits, and Gods Most of the "chapters" in theJS deal with daily life in a general way by indicating the auspiciousness of certain days for various activities such as marriage, building, farming, travelling, hunting, and even drinking and eating. Some chapters, however, are exclu- sively "issue oriented". For example, one deals with dreams (883 ver.-882 ver.),23 and another with thieves (827 ver.-814 ver.). What will concern us here is the above-mentioned Chieh, or 19 Harper, "A Chinese Demonography." 20 Ibid. 21 Loewe, "The Almanacs." 22 Kalinowski, "Les traites de Shuihudi." 23 See Lin Fu-shih &amp;c+, "Shih-shih Shui-hu-ti Ch'in-chienJih-shu-chung ti</page><page sequence="7">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA 231 "Inquiry",24 which contains instructions for handling various evil ghosts, spirits, and even gods. In the "Inquiry", dozens of evil ghosts and spirits are first identified, the text then detailing various exorcism methods. Some of the ghosts are animal in appearance, such as the "sacred dog" (Shen-kou Onp1 ): When a dog continuously enters a person's house at night, seizing the husband and sporting with the woman, and it cannot be caught, it is a sacred dog disguised as a ghost. Use the bark of a mulberry tree . . ., roast it and eat it. This will stop it. (848 ver.-847 ver.) Or it may be a "sacred serpent" (Shen-hui Jif): When a ghost persistently follows a man and a woman but goes away upon seeing other people, it is a sacred serpent disguised as a human being. If you stab its neck with a good sword, it will not come anymore. (862 ver.) Although the word shen (god, sacred) is incorporated in the names of these two apparitions, it is clear from the context that they were seen as malicious demons. The word shen here is only an adjective describing their supernatural nature. Some other evil ghosts may originate from plants, e.g., a certain "thorn demon" (Chi-kuei "X ): When in one house, without reason, all inhabitants fall victim to a plague, some dying and some suffering illness, this is caused by the presence of a thorn demon. It is buried upright and the earth above it is damp during a drought, and dry during a flood. If you dig it out and throw it away, this will stop it (859 ver.-858 ver.) As the ancient Chinese believed that certain plants, such as peach wood and thorn,25 possessed mysterious powers, it is not surprising meng"ttgUltPhffiHtt, FShih-huo .A (new series), vol. 17, no. 3/4 (1987), pp. 30-37. 24 See Harper, "A Chinese Demonography". Some of the exorcism methods mentioned in the JS are rather similar to those found in European demonology. See Ioan P. Couliano, "Demonomagic", in his Eros and Magic in the Renaissance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 144-173. 25 For example, the Tso-chuan (fourth year of Duke Chao) states that "a bow of peach wood and arrows of thorn were employed to put away calamitous in- fluences." J. Legge, The Chinese Classics, vol. V, The Ch'un Ts'ew with the Tso Chuen (Taipei: Southern Materials Center reprint, 1985), p. 596a. Even in Chieh itself, we can find the use of peach wood (no. 872 ver., 869 ver.), mulberry wood (no. 864-863 ver., 848 ver.), as well as mu-chi (a kind of wood) (no. 871 ver., 868 ver., 845 ver., 830 ver.), as materials for making exorcist weapons. See Derk Bodde, Festivals in Classical China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975), pp. 127-138.</page><page sequence="8">232 MU-CHOU POO that some of them should have become evil demons. Natural phenomena are another source for the formation of evil powers, e.g., "Heavenly fire": When heavenly fire burns a person's house and is unstoppable, it will stop if it is quenched using white sand. (885 ver.) Similarly, other malicious powers of nature such as "thunder" (854 ver.), "cloud" (852 ver.), "cold wind" (838 ver.), "swift wind" (839 ver.), etc., can also be curbed by various methods of exorcism. Lastly, the dead were, of course, expected to become ghosts, especially when they died an untimely death. Thus, there is the "hungry ghost": Whenever a ghost holds a basket in order to enter a persons's house, saying: "Give me food", it is a hungry ghost. If you throw a shoe at it, it will stop. (834 ver.) The "young dead" can also haunt people if they have not been buried: When a ghost continuously enters a person's house naked, it is someone who died young and was not buried. If you spread ashes on it, it will stop. (846 ver.) Of the seventy entries in the C/hieh, almost half of the ghosts and spirits are anthropomorphic; over ten entries concern zoomorphic demons (including insects), and in nine cases the forces of nature are the troublemakers. It is interesting that even inanimate objects are considered as possible sources of demonic spirits: When throughout the house there is the sound of a drum but one does not see that drum, it is a ghost-drum. It will stop if you answer it with a human drum. (862 ver.) This thriving ghostly community constitutes the object of worship on occasions such as "ghost worshipping" (819) or "sacrifice to the multitude of gods above and below" (732), mentioned in the other chapters of the JS. The nature of the "gods", furthermore, is basically similar to that of the ghosts. Thus we read about the "Great God" (Ta-shen)cJf ): His place cannot be passed through because he is good at harming people. Make balls from dog's excrements and take them along when you pass through that place. When you see the god, hit him with these, and it will not harm anyone anymore. (869 ver.-868 ver.) There is also the "God on High" (Shang-shen JZJ1ifP): When a man like a bird and a beast continuously walks into a person's house, it is the God on High .. . If you strike the drum and sound the cymbals and scare it with the noise, it will not come anymore. (865 ver.-863 ver.)</page><page sequence="9">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA 233 There is practically no difference between these "great" and "high" gods and the malicious demons, either in the nature of their deeds, or in the treatment they receive from the people. The idea that there is little difference of nature between gods (shen) and ghosts (kuei) is, of course, not peculiar to the JS.26 The two characters "ghost" and "god" (kuei-shen9Jif$ ) often refer to the same supernatural being in pre-Ch'in documents. The general meaning of shen is clearly stated in this passage from The Book of Rites: Mountains, forests, streams, valleys, hills and mounds, which are able to produce clouds, create winds and rain, and generate monsters, are all consi- dered as having spiritual power (shen).27 Thus, the word shen is often better rendered as "spirit" rather than "god". This idea was not confined to the Confucianist circles. One passage in the Han Fei tzu 9Pf states that: When the world is ruled according to the Tao, the ghosts will not be powerful (pu-shen &gt;T,~). The people of an orderly age and ghosts and gods do not harm each other. Therefore it is said that it is not because their "ghosts" (kuei) are not powerful (pu-shen), it is because their "spirits" (shen) do not harm people.28 Here the word shen is used as a description of the nature of the ghost, and shen and kuei are interchangeable terms. Although there is a paucity of information concerning the popu- lar conceptions of gods, spirits, and ghosts in traditional sources, one can still discern that the concept of spiritual beings in the JS does not differ from other traditional perceptions. For example, the Chou-li W]dz records the following method to expel the "god of the water-bugs": The Hu-chuo-shih TZf is responsible for the elimination of water-bugs. To expel them, use a drum made of earth, and throw burnt rocks at them. If one 26 See Harper, "A Chinese Demonography".

The idea of killing a "god" or "spirit" reveals another aspect of the people's understanding of the nature of "supernatural beings". Since they can be killed, it follows that they are "mortals" too. The distinction between "supernatural" and "natural", therefore, was probably not very obvious, especially with regard to the "lesser spirits" and demons. In other words, in the popular conception as revealed in theJS, the worlds of man and of the spirits were not separate, but formed one continuous whole. This is in contrast to the famous exposition by Kuan Yi-fu 04,1 to the effect that the earth and heaven were separated by Ch'ung { and Li V on the order of Emperor Chuan Hsii 30.3 The world of the JS, to use Kuan Yi-fu's words, was still one in which "people mingled with gods and spirits" (min-shen tsa-jou K:,itg) . Thus our use of the term "supernatural" is only conventional, as it is difficult to find its equivalent in the vocabulary of ancient China. A more pertinent term in referring to the nature of those beings that the users ofJS had to deal with might be "extra-human", which would denote the sphere of existence of these spirits without referring to their quality or ability. As pointed out above, the gods, ghosts and demons in the JS do not act as arbiters of human morality and ethics. They are not part of the mores, i.e., the moral standards and ethical behaviour of the people using the JS. Their actions, therefore, are not responses to human behaviour but expressions of their own intention, for good or for ill. As for their misdeeds, some produce various sorts of annoyance,3' some affect people's psychological balance,32 and some cause all kinds of diseases.33 These are, indeed, unfriendly ghosts. Yet it seems that in the end they pose no real threat to the user of theJS. It is always possible to counteract a demon, as illustrated by 29 Chou-li )IjI (Taipei: I-wen, 1970, Shih-san-ching chu-shu), chuan 37, p. 7. 30 Kuo-yu (Taipei: Chung-hua, 1970), "Ch'u-yT"'", chuan 18, pp. la-2a.

This partly reflects the mechanistic and optimistic world view of the JS, which I shall examine in a moment. From the gallery of demons and spirits mentioned in the JS, we gain the impression of a world inhabited not only by men and animals but also by a host of supernatural beings. These can be categorized into certain orders. The lowest order, it seems, in- cluded forces close to natural phenomena, such as wind, thunder, or heavenly fire. The highest order, on the other hand, might include such deities as the "Lord on High" (Shang-ti), the "Emper- or on High" (Shang-huang), the "God on High" (Shang-shen), "Heaven" (T'ien), or the "Red Emperor" (Ch'ih-ti). Between the highest and the lowest orders were various demons, ghosts, and spirits such as the "Earth God" (T'u-shen) (764 ver.), and others that we have already mentioned. Nevertheless, all the supernatural forces belong to the same category of beings. In other words, it is not their general nature but their respective individual powers which distinguish them. Some scholars are inclined to see the various deities in the highest order as being only difFerent names for a single "supreme god".34 This view, however, is untenable, at least in the identification of the "Red Emperor" with the other high gods. Worshipped by the Ch'in court alongside the other three heavenly sovereigns (White, Azure, and Yellow) ,35 the "Red Emperor" obviously was not the same as the "God on High" or "Emperor on High". This order of spiritual beings is broadly consistent with that found in the classical texts: the spiritual world reflects the human world, and the relative positions among spiritual beings are compa- rable to those in human society. What is special in the case of the JS, however, is the preoccupation with those beings that belong to the lower-middle echelon of the spiritual power structure. While the higher gods are rarely mentioned, the text abounds with var- ious minor demons and spirits. This is seldom found in the tradi- tional texts, which are documents pertaining primarily to the ruling class, politically as well as culturally, and which usually perceive ` See Tou and Wang, "Ch'in-tai tsung-chiao chih li-ch'eng". ` Shih-chi (Peking: Chung-hua, 1960), chuian 28.

This naturally leads to the next question: what kind of religious mentality does this preoc- cupation with the minor demons reflect? And how does it differ from the picture in the classical texts? IV. The religious mentality reflected in the Jih-shu Generally speaking, the main object of religious beliefs is to explain the relationship between man and the spiritual and to find a standing point for man's existence in the world.36 The various divinational, as well as demonographical, treatise contained in the JS provide us with the substance of a particular belief in the spiritual world. Furthermore, from the methods that the people employed to deal with extra-human forces and beings, and thus to survive, it is possible for us to investigate the mentality that sup- ported this belief. The cosmos reflected in the JS has a dual nature. On the one hand, it is predictable, for every phenomenon in it is already fixed according to its correspondence with the nature of the days and hours indicated in the various divinational treatises. In other words, things move in a pre-determined direction. Even the iden- tification of thieves, for example, can easily be achieved by referring to the time when the burglary occurred (827-814 ver.).37 On the other hand, it is also a world full of capricious spirits and demons, who often act beyond human comprehension. Yet, since the world is basically predictable, the role played by demons and gods is also fixed into a set structure. Thus, these unwelcome spiritual beings can be shunned through the observance of certain methods of exorcism. For example, there are certain days suitable for "removing the disastrous and expelling the inauspicious" (734). The "In- quiry", or "Demonography", discussed above, moreover, provides the user with all sorts of methods for the successful handling of an attack by the unfriendly demons. What one can deduce from this is a kind of mentality wherein the unpredictable elements of the world are recognized as such, but at the same time contained by concep- tualizing them as part of a pre-determined structure, thereby be- 36 For a recent discussion of the definition of religion, see P. Byrne, "Religion and the Religions", in S. Sutherland et al. ed., The World's Religions (London: Routledge, 1988), pp. 3-28. 3 For an introduction to these divinational methods, see M. Loewe, "The Almanacs (ih-shu) from Shui-hu-ti." See also his general introduction to the art of divination in ancient China, in M. Loewe and C. Blacker eds.

Inc., 1981), pp. 38-62.</page><page sequence="13">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA 237 coming no more unpredictable than the changing of the seasons. The rationale of the JS is based precisely on this worldview: every phenomenon in the world has a one-to-one correlation with a certain day or hour, and the auspiciousness of the day or hour is a known fact. This, however, is not the same as determinism. Man has to follow the instructions prescribed in the JS to find his way through the perils of life, but he can still move freely within the fixed structure, as in playing a game of chess according to the rules. Yet since he has only to select the appropriate timing of daily events according to the prescribed days and hours with their inhe- rent nature, there is no way, or no need, for him to apply his subjective and independent intelligence and will-power beyond a limited and conventional value system. In order to enjoy a comfort- able and prosperous life, one does not have to exert any personal effort, but only to choose the correct day and hour to undertake something. There is no need for any moral reflection on the part of the user of such a Daybook since neither the nature of the days nor the gods and spirits are correlated with ethical or moral values. In the "Inquiry", for example, no explanation is given as to why people are infected by unfriendly demons and ghosts. In many cases, the text plainly states that the reasons are unknown. Thus we read: When a person is constantly attacked by a demon for no reason, it is the thorn demon. If you make a bow from peach wood and arrows fromjujube and feather them with cock feathers, and shoot it when you see it, it will be stopped. (869-868 ver.) In a sense, this reflects an optimistic mentality: there is no unsolv- able dilemma in the world, one need not search one's conscience before trying to find a simple solution from the Daybook. This world view, it should be made clear, is not unique to theJS. The theories of Yin-yang and of the Five Phases, which first appeared during the Warring States period, also reflect a cosmolo- gy based on the mechanical movements and inter-dependency of various elements. The structure of the chapter "Monthly Ordi- nances" (Yueh-ling PJ e ) in the Lu-shih ch'un-chl'iu i Att7, for ex- ample, resembles certain parts of the JS in that the characters of all the days in a year are defined according to a pre-determined scheme which applies the Yin-yang and the Five Phases theory.38 38 Lii-shih ch'un-ch'iu (Taipei: Chung-hua, 1972), chuan 1-12; two other versions are found in Li-chi, chuian 14; Huai-nan tzu (Taipei: Chung-hua, 1976), chuian 4. See Loewe, "The Almanacs".</page><page sequence="14">238 MU-CHOU POO Although the JS does not fully employ the Yin-yang and Five Phases theory,39 and although its scope, encompassing the more mundane concerns of the commoners, is not quite comparable to the higher concerns for the welfare of the entire society and state expressed in the Yueh-ling, both texts express a rather similar men- tality. The universe, according to this mentality, is inhabited by autonomous numinous forces the nature of which, nevertheless, is recognizable and therefore subject to human manipulation. Thus, by consulting the Daybook, an ordinary person can try to avoid disaster and gain a better life; whereas, by conforming to the instructions of the Yueh-ling, the head of the state is able to guide his subjects in the proper manner in all social, political, and economic undertakings throughout the year. It seems, therefore, that the cosmology of the JS grew out of the same cultural milieu as that which produced the Yieh-ling.40 Unlike the highly idealized Yueh-ling, however, the JS is not an integrated, homogeneous work. The very fact that there are two versions of it in the corpus of texts discovered at Shui-hu-ti, plus a recent discovery of another example in Kansu, as well as some earlier examples,41 of similar "treatises", albeit differing in length, demonstrates that we are dealing with a kind of "miscellanea" of individual divinational methods then in current use and frequently appearing as part of a collection. Furthermore, the contents of the various treatises often contra- 39 For the use of the Five Phases theory in the jih-shu, see nos. 974-978; 813 ver.-804 ver.

Yet they never seem to have totally displaced the role of spirits which resist incorporation into abstract schemes ..... one can thus find themes of correlative cosmology intri- cately interwoven with the active intervention of spirits . . ." I would suggest that, in the JS at least, the active intervention of spirits was still controllable and controlled. 41 Ho Shuang-ch'iian O : "T'ien-shui Fang-ma-t'an Ch'in-chien tsung- shu"X;W% .itLL , Wen-wu -z-t, 1989, 2, pp. 23-31; idem., "T'ien-shui Fang-ma-t'an Ch'in-chien chia-chung jih-shu k'ao-shu" Ni FP 9 H tL, in Ch'in Han chien-tu lun-wen-chi, pp. 7-28.

For example, slip no. 837 states, "Do not buy or sell slaves, concubines, or horses on wu X days", and slip no. 840 states, "Do not buy or sell slaves, concubines, horses, cattle or merchandise on shen F days". Since no restrictions on the months are given, all the wu and shen days, accordingly, should be consi- dered as unfavourable for transactions in the above mentioned "articles". Yet this cannot be taken as a general principle in the entireJS. In the chapter "Ch'in-ch'u" j,, the wu days of the eighth month are "shou M&amp; days" (750), and the shen days of the tenth month are also "sshou days" (752). The shou days, however, "are suitable for buying slaves, horses, and cattle" (752), a direct con- tradiction to the statements of nos. 837 and 840. To give another example, no. 834 states, "Do not bury (the dead) on ch'en R days", yet in the chapter " Chi-ch'en" MR, the ch'en days of the seventh and eighth months are called "cheng-yang IEP- " days, which are "favour- able ... for giving birth to a son, and to bury (the dead)" (763). It is not easy to reconcile such mutually contradictory statements. Even among the chapters that deal with the general principles of the various daily activities, such as the "Ch'in-ch'u" and "Chi-ch'en" chapters mentioned above, it is difficult to find total agreement. In the chapter "Ch'u ", the tzu f days of the eleventh month are called chiehk days, the qualification given to which reads: "Chieh days: unsuccesful in (all kinds of) work" (731). In the chapter Ch'in-ch'u, however, the tzu days of the eleventh month are called "chien k days", and chien days are "auspicious days, suitable for a she-fu t (local official) to perform his duties, for making offerings, etc." (743). It is obvious that, if we are to accept that these different chapters do have their own inner logic, then they ought to be seen as originally separate divinational treatises which do not necessari- ly belong to the same tradition.42 A passage in the Shih-chi illustrates this situation very cogently: In the days of Emperor Wu, the diviners were once gathered together and asked whether a certain day was suitable for taking a wife. The Wu-hsing E Y diviner said "yes", the geomancer said "no", the Chien-ch'u I diviner said "inauspicious", the Ts'ung-ch'en tR diviner said "great disaster", the Li , diviner said "minor disaster", the T'ien-jen XA diviner said "somewhat auspi- cious", the T'ai-i t- diviner said "highly auspicious." They could not come to a conclusion in their heated debate, and a petition was sent to the Emperor. The 42 For example, Chang Ming-ch'ia Au, "Yiin-meng Ch'in-chien jih-shu chan-pu-shu ch'u-t'an" Ii H [ h ilJW , Wen Po, 1988,3, pp. 6-74, iden- tified sources representing six different schools of divination in the various sections of the jih-shu.</page><page sequence="16">240 MU-CHOU POO Emperor replied: "To avoid the various death taboos, follow the Wu-hsing method in principle".43 Although the incident occurred in the Han dynasty, it certainly reflects the chaotic situation among the diviners of earlier periods, and corroborates our observation concerning the miscellaneous nature of the material in the JS. What principle or strategy, then, should the user of the Daybook follow? We do not really know. But a clue can be found in a passage in the chapter "hsing I" (to travel): Whenever one plans to do something, it is necessary to choose the "leisure" days within a month, as long as these are not the days for the descent of the Red Emperor. Even if those other days bear inauspicious labels, there will be no great harm. (858-859) In other words, even if "those other days" in the hsing chapter are inauspicious days mentioned in other chapters, one can still consid- er them harmless in a travel context. This instruction, therefore, actually tells the user that under certain conditions some of the inauspicious days can be safely ignored. It also shows that people recognized the existence of inconsistencies among the various di- vinational treatises contained in theJS, and that they considered it impossible or impractical to follow all the instructions at once. The users of the JS, therefore, did not concern themselves with whether these "instructions for daily activities" constituted a logic- al system. What interested them was whether they could use any one of the divinational methods to solve their immediate problems. In a sense, the contradictions that existed among the different divinational treatises actually provided the user with a loophole when certain days were considered unfavourable in one method but favourable in another. Is it fair to assume, then, that this kind of self-contradiction reflected a lack of logical reasoning, or an oppor- tunist mentality that strived to gain maximum benefit by any means available? To make such ajudgment may seem inevitable to the modern eye, as evinced by the use of terms such as "imma- ture", "superstitious", or "primitive" in some of the studies men- tioned above. However, one should at least consider the possibility that the various divinational treatises represented different methods used by the ancients to decipher the mysteries of the spiritual forces in the world, and that their primary concern was not to construct a comprehensive structure of the workings of the 43 Shih-chi, chuan 127, p. 3222.</page><page sequence="17">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA 241 universe, something along the lines of the Yueh-ling, but to provide solutions to practical problems, albeit on a limited basis. This is not unlike the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians or the Meso- potamians, which had a host of deities whose functions and nature contradicted each other and yet still co-existed, and which are seen as beliefs that approached the universe in a pluralistic manner producing a rich diversity of answers. An explanation concerning a certain deity, or a natural or social phenomenon, or even the origin of the universe, was designed for no more than solving some par- ticular problem.44 To sum up the idea of the spiritual world in the JS, it is clear that, like in most other classical texts, the gods, spirits, and ghosts are more or less anthropomorphic in nature. There is a distance between this and the concept of t'ien X, a more abstract idea of the moral principle of the universe developed in theju f tradition from the Western Chou period onwards.45 Furthermore, the mechanistic cosmology also differs from the more sophisticated organismic cos- mology which, later in the Western Han period, became the pre- dominant ideology of the official and elite class. This organismic cosmology sees the universe as a harmonic entity comprised of Heaven, Earth, and Man. The crucial part of the theory is that these three elements are intertwined and influence each other through the principles of the Yin-yang and Five Phases theory.46 There the mechanistic cosmology of the more down-to-earthJS was recreated in a far more complex way that was incomprehensible to the common people. The proliferation of various divinational and mantic works cited by the I-wen chih t,Z of Han-shu A , under the shu-shu WiJt section ,47 as well as those "superstitions" that Wang Ch'ung and other intellectuals tried hard to rebuke, suggest what the common people availed themselves of when practical problem needed to be resolved. ` H.

The socio-cultural background of the Jih-shu Although a kind of guidebook for daily life, theJS does not cover every aspect of society. In particular, problems related to themes such as literature, social ethics, or statecraft find little echo in it. What it deals with are mainly the daily concerns of common people: the time to get married, to do business, to sow the seeds, to pay a visit to an official, or to start a project.48 As a practical handbook, its contents cater to a heterogeneous readership, since it can be used by a minor official (886-895), a farmer (747-745 ver., 941, 962), or a small businessman (818). Yet the way in which the concerns of these different social groups are presented indicates that they actually share a common mentality. For example, in the chapter "ch'u" (730-742), which gives a general picture of the nature of all the days in a year, we read statements such as: Yin 1 days: favourable for the household, for making offerings, for marriage, very auspicious for buying merchandise. When paying a visit to high officials, the results should be fine and no problem should arise. (735) Or, Ta A days: favourable for marshalling the troops, for setting out to battle, for meeting with people. When making offerings to (the gods and ghosts) high and low, all will be favourable. If a son is born, favourable; if it is a girl, she is destined to leave the country. (736) In another chapter, "chi-ch'en", the statements are even more elabo- rate: Hsiu W days are the so-called "double-bright (days)": favourable for fighting in the field, certain to be able to capture kings and dukes; when a son is born he will be handsome and tall and wise. Favourable for meeting with people and for raising cattle. Good for getting married, for marrying daughters off, for making garments, for making offerings. Suitable for eating, drinking, singing and making merry, and for approaching officials. Favourable for changing official jobs, , even if it stops raining, do not repair rooms or build houses. When it is dry at the beginning of the first month, the harvest will be good, and there will be military actions. (761-762) 48 A convenient subject index of the contents of the JS is provided in Jao Tsung-i and Tseng Hsien-t'ung, Jih-shu. Most scholars agree that the JS represents the life-style of the common people.

For discussion, see P'u Mu-chou, "Shui- hu-ti Ch'in- chien Jih-shu ti shih-chieh."</page><page sequence="19">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA 243 From these paragraphs it is apparent how the interests of the various social groups are integrated into a single text. It remains to be demonstrated, however, whether the text reflects the characteristics of Ch'in culture. Based on its contents, it would be somewhat tenuous to argue that it represented the cultural life of only the Ch'in people, since the mundane concerns revealed in the text could have belonged to the lower-middle stratum of many regions in China at that time. Moreover, it has been argued that the existence of a conversion table of the names of the months in the Ch'in and Ch'u calendars (793-796) suggests that the text was used by the local Ch'in ruling class as a reference for Ch'u customs, and that the ch'u :Ft chapter is actually a Ch'u divinational text.49 This can be corroborated by the fact that on a silk manuscript discovered in a Ch'u tomb of the late Warring States period at Ch'ang-sha, there is a brief "treatise" on inauspicious days which bears a close resemblance to some of the passages inJS.0 It has also been suggested that the method of using the position and move- ment of the planet Jupiter to predict fortunes was a Ch'u custom.5' On the other hand, those who maintain that the JS is a product of Ch'in culture state that this is evinced by the fact that no special attention is paid to either the larger issues of social justice (i X ), or the ideals of humanity (en i'), or (Confucian) ritual and music, the hallmarks of the Ch'i O and Lu C culture, but only to those matters concerning the everyday life of the people. This view of Ch'in culture opines that its nature was vulgar, uncouth, and utilitarian. It is an image perpetuated by ancient texts such as the Tso-chuan and Shih-chi.52 This kind of argument, however, errs in 49 Kudo Motoo, "The Ch'in Bamboo Strip Book of Divination (Jih-shu) and Ch'in Legalism." Also see Chang Wen-yii g3E, "Yiin-meng Ch'in-chienjih-shu ch'u-t'an" 5 H * H 1, Chiang Han lun-t'an, 1987, 4, pp. 68-73. 50 See a detailed study of this manuscript by Jao Tsung-i and Tseng Hsien- t'ung, Ch'u Po Shu f (Hong Kong: Chung-hua, 1985), especially pp. 71-85 for this brief section.

The traditional texts unanimously claim that Ch'in culture was of such a uncultivated nature.

The famous essay by Chia i MY , Kuo Ch'in Lun W (cited in Shih-chi, chuian 6, pp. 276 ff.) is a striking example. Although it is not easy to discredit all the accounts, one may suspect that the formation of this negative image of Ch'in</page><page sequence="20">244 MU-CHOU POO comparing the worldview and religious beliefs of the lower echelon of society with the culture of the elite of Ch'i and Lu. To say that thejS reflects a certain utilitarian and vulgar spirit is one thing, to say that this spirit belonged only to the Ch'in people is another. It might have been equally suitable for representing the Ch'i or Lu popular culture, since the ordinary people of the states of Ch'i and Lu might have more in common with their counterparts in Ch'in or Ch'u than with the high-flown culture (in the Chou court tradition) of the upper class of their own states. The recent discovery in T'ien-shui, Kansu province, of two more versions of the Jih-shu, while adding to the academic debate, also provides the possibility for the emergence of new perspectives on the nature of this kind of text.53 From the published text and descriptions, it is certain that there are similarities as well as differences between these two versions of the Jih-sAfu and the JS. Some scholars now propose that the T'ien-shui versions are repre- sentative of Ch'in culture, and the JS representative of Ch'u cul- ture. The T'ien-shui versions, it is argued, contain little informa- tion concerning ghosts and spirits, which indeed was of little in- terest to the Ch'in people, who were more concerned with practical matters than with intangible ghosts and spirits. In contrast, thejS contains far more information on spirits and ghosts, which must be a reflection of the more mystical Ch'u religion.54 Although the validity of this argument has yet to be further demonstrated, it contradicts directly the above mentioned contentions of both Li and Huang and Tou and Wang. It is interesting to note that, observing the same descriptions concerning the ghosts and spirits in the JS, Li and Huang consider that they show a "lack of rich imagination", and claim that they represent the Ch'in religious tradition. The fact that neither Li and Huan'g nor Tou and Wang culture may have been due to the animosity of the people of the Central Plain states, who were proud of their own cultural traditions, yet ever since the Eastern Chou period had been unable to curb the rapid growth of the "barbarian" Ch'in influence. For a re-evaluation of the traditional concept of the Legalist tradition in the Ch'in state and empire, see L. B. Fields, "The Legalists and the Fall of Ch'in: Humanism and Tyranny", Journal of Asian Histoiy, 17 (1983), pp. 1-39. 53 Ho, Wen-wu, 1989, 2, pp. 23-31; Ch'in Han chieh-tu lun-wen-chi, pp. 7-28. ` Ibid. One has to remember, however, that the main difference between the T'ien-shui and the Shui-hu-ti versions is the number of chapters that have been preserved, and few of the available chapters in the chia f3 version of T'ien-shui texts mention gods or spirits. This also applies to the corresponding chapters in the JS. It would be interesting to see, when the i Z version of the T'ien-shui Daybook is published, whether more gods and spirits are to be found.</page><page sequence="21">POPULAR RELIGION IN PRE-IMPERIAL CHINA have seen the T'ien-shui versions, and thus concluded that the JS was a product of the Ch'in culture, seems to indicate that their arguments are built more on subjective impressions than on actual evidence. In fact, there is no need to choose or judge at this point. What would seem to appear is that the wrong questions are being asked: the issue is not whether the text reflects Ch'in or Ch'u culture-it may include both, or even more. One might consider, preferably, that the JS may have reflected a layer of popular culture that was shared by people from a wide area, extending to all of China proper. With regard to the possible geographic distribution of popular beliefs similar to those found in the JS, a story mentioned in Han Fei tzu is of special interest: A man of the state of Yen named Li Chi was wont to travel to faraway places. His wife thus had an affair with another man. One day Chi came home unexpectedly when the man was with his wife in the inner chamber. His wife was frightened. However, the housemaid advised, "Let the young gentleman be naked with dishevelled hair, rush straight out through the door. Then we will pretend to have seen nothing". Thereupon the man followed her advice and ran out fast through the door. Chi said: "Who is that?" "Nobody", replied everyone in the house. Li Chi asked, "Have I seen a ghost?" His wife replied: "Certain- ly!" "What shall I do then?" "Take the excrement of five kinds of animals and bathe in it." Chi said: "All right." So he bathed in the excrement."55 This story concerning the popular beliefs of Yen, a state located to the north of the Central Plain, is quite similar to a paragraph mentioned in the JS: When a ghost continuously follows a person's wife and cohabits with her, saying: "(I am) a son of the Lord on High (shang-ti h± ), who has come down for taking my pleasure," he will die if one, wanting him to leave, bathes with dog's excrements and beats him with a reed. (858 ver.) The similarity between the exorcism methods as well as the reasons for applying them suggests that the JS reflected not merely a local custom or belief, but something that had a wider cultural basis. For another example, the Shan Hai ching 'IXE, in which various sacri- ficial rituals to the spirits and monsters of distant places are de- scribed, is likely to stem from the same religious milieu as theJS. In the JS, there are also various paragraphs for choosing auspicious days and making proper offerings before travel, such as ssu-hsing liang-jih fJ- B (808), ssu-hsing jih i1 HE (932), hsing-ssu TfiJ 55 Wang Hsien-shen, Han Fei tzu chi-chieh, chiian 10, "Nei-ch'u-shuo hsia UTl-T", pp. 182-183. Cf. W. K. Liao, The Complete Works of Han Fei Tzu, vol. II., pp. 7-8. My translation follows Liao with minor changes. 245</page><page sequence="22">MU-CHOU POO (1039).56 It seems that whereas the JS provided people with a means to decide on auspicious days for travelling, the Shan Hai ching provided people with a guide to the correct manners to make sacrifices to the foreign spirits of their destinations.57 Both reflect the needs of travellers at different stages of their travels, and both are unambiguous about and certain of the working and structure of the spiritual world, thus betraying a similar religious mentality. The diviners, who may have been the keepers of the various divinational methods collected in the Daybooks, were not restricted to Ch'in or Ch'u either. In Mo-tzu MT, for example, it is recorded that once when Mo-tzu travelled to the state of Ch'i, he met a diviner (jih-che H3 ) who advised him not to go north, for it was a day when the Ti i was going to slaughter the black dragon, and black was a synonym of mo , .58 In the Shih-chi, Ssu-ma Ch'ien also writes that "the diviners of Ch'i, Ch'u, Ch'in and Chao each have their own customs."59 The diviners were therefore scattered among the Warring States. The differences between the Shui-hu-ti and the T'ien-shui versions may be attributed to local customs, cultural characteristics, the idiosyncracy of the individual practitioners, or simply pure chance as to what has been preserved, even though a detailed study has yet to be undertaken. But the basic similarity of the craft of the diviners and whatever cultural phenomenon they represented certainly suggests that the users ofJih-shu constituted a 56 See Kudo Motoo, "Umorete ita koshin". 57 It has been suggested that the Shan Hai ching was originally a catalogue of distant countries and subjects or a travel guide. An earlier study in this respect is Chiang Shao-yuan I:j , Chung-kuo ku-tai lii-hsing chih yen-chiu PlifftS f WI/T (Shanghai: Shang-wu, 1937). This is not to deny the fact that the Shan Hai ching contains a wealth of mythological as well as folkloric allusions. Scholars of early Chinese myth and religion in general agree that the Shan Hai ching contains material from as early as the Warring States period, if not earlier.

In the Han dynasty, moreover, fragments of a similar jih-shu are found as far away as Wu-wei on the western frontier, as well as in Hopei.60 That the custom of consulting the Jih-shu became a deep- rooted part of popular culture in the subsequent centuries is exem- plified by the great collection of this genre in the Hsieh-chi pien-fang shu }S ff m, compiled on order of the Ch'ien-lung Emperor of the Ch'ing dynasty.61 The modern descendants of the Jih-shu, i.e., the t'ung-shu / M , huang-li X , or nung-min-li ~ , are pieces of folk literature that are still very widely used.62 It is also worth noticing that although the JS is a product of popular culture, it cannot be seen as a comprehensive "mirror" of the culture of the people that produced it. The culture or mentality of any people is built on a structure far more complicated than can be represented by any single type of text. From the similarity between the structure of some of the chapters of the JS and the Yiieh-ling, one can see that both texts shared a common ground in cosmology, and this rules out a clear-cut differentiation between the so-called popular and elite cultures. The owner of the text, more- over, can hardly be seen as a person lacking sophisticated thought if we admit that another text found in his tomb, Wei-li chih tao ,i; ;g (The Way of Serving as an Official) (679-729), in which Taoist, Legalist and Confucian ideas are intermixed, also reflects his intellectual world. It would be problematic to judge the cultural background of this particular user of theJS based on theJS alone.63 60 See note 41 above and Yoshinami Takashi, "Unbo Shinkan Nisshoshoron." Also see Loewe, "The Almanacs". 61 Hsieh-chi pien-fang shu, in Ying-yin Wen-yiian-ko Ssu-k'u ch'ian-shu f p T JiS,tE/~rSl , nno. 811 (Taipei: Shang-wu reprint). 62 One such "Daybook" published in 1991 in Taiwan, for example, still lists under each day various activities and their auspiciousness in a language almost the same as that found in the JS. Its utilitarian nature, albeit in a modernized fashion, is amply illustrated by a section that "predicts" the rise and fall of the stock market in a sexagenary cycle. (Chung-kuo min-li qs ] , distributed by the Farmers Association of Taipei County.) For a study of divination in the Ch'ing period, see R. J. Smith, Fortune-tellers and Philosophers: Divination in Traditional Chinese Society (Boulder, San Francisco, London: Westview Press, 1991). 63 This raises the question of why the tomb owner Hsi possessed such a text. Some scholars suggest that the purpose of his collecting the Daybooks (since there are two versions of jih-shu in his tomb) was to help him better understand, and therefore control, the local population. See Kudo Motoo, "Suikochi Shinbo chikukan Nissho yoi mieta ho to shuzoku" bt- t X / : t E i _, Mokkan kenkyu 7f,ffi5, no. 10 (1988), pp. 113-129; Lin Chien-ming, "Jih-shu yu Ch'in 247</page><page sequence="24">248 MU-CHOU POO The worldview or religious mentality reflected in the JS may not be totally alien to those of the upper-middle stratum of society, yet it demonstrates a keen concern for the daily lives of the common people. To say that the religion in the JS was "immature" or "primitive", however, is to judge from an evolutionist point of view and a narrow concept of the nature of religion. This concept holds that all religions possess the same nature and undergo the same development. The truth is that, despite the fact that the religious mentality presented in the text seems to be illogical, amoral, and utilitarian in nature, this "immature" religion was in itself a self- contained form of religious belief. In addition, the existence of various Daybooks from the Han dynasty, as well as the unbroken tradition of the Huang-li over two thousand years, forcefully demon- strate that a good part of the popular mentality of the Chinese people had been formed even before China entered the Imperial period. If, indeed, before the Ch'in Dynasty united China political- ly, the people in various parts of the country already shared a more or less common "popular culture", as reflected in theJih-shu, it is very likely that this sharing of popular culture facilitated the uni- fication and subsequent sustenance of the Ch'in-Han empire. Han shih-tai ti li-chih" H j Hsinshih-hsieh Pr r*, vol. II, no. 2 (1991), pp. 31-51. It is also possible, however, that the Daybook served not only Hsi's own personal interests, but also those of the people in determining the auspiciousness of their daily activities. This is feasible since, as a local official, he bore the responsibility to "teach" the people, as is made clear in the text Wei-li chih tao.
