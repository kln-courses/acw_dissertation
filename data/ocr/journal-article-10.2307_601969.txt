<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELEPHANTA AND THE RITUAL OF THE LAKULISA-PASUPATAS CHARLES D. COLLINS ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY The relief-panels inside of the rock-cut temple at Elephanta reveal an integrated program when related to standard literary sources. The sectarian affiliation of the temple points to the LakulTga-Pasupatas, of which two ritual texts are available. These texts are used to explain in what ways sectarian ritual might have related to the sculptural and architectural scheme at Elephanta. THE LARGE ROCK-CUT TEMPLE dedicated to Siva on Elephanta Island in Bombay Harbor is one of the most important monuments of Indian art. Many un- certainties still exist about Elephanta, however, be- cause there is no inscription with which to date or otherwise identify the cave-temple.' In addition, while much has been written about the iconography of the individual relief-sculptures inside Elephanta, these panels have not been systematically studied as an integrated program,' especially with reference to spe- cific sectarian literary sources. I propose to briefly survey some of the relationships between the Ele- phanta reliefs in light of ritual practice and doctrine, ' There is reliable information recorded as early as 1603 by the Portuguese chronicler Diogo de Couto that there was an inscribed stone over the entrance to Elephanta which had been removed fifty or so years before and shipped to the Portuguese king, D. Joao 111, in order to have it translated. It then appears to have been lost. I have summarized the material relating to this inscription and others found on Elephanta Island in an appendix to my dissertation, and have concluded that the archives of D. Joao III would be the most promising avenue to search for this important primary source for the cave-temple. See Revd. W. K. Fletcher, trans., "Coutto's Decade VII.-Book III.-Chap. Xl.: Of the very remarkable and stupendous Pagoda of Elephanta," The Jour- nal of the Bombay Branch of the Roy~al Asiatic Societyl, I (July, 1841-July, 1844), 44-45 and see Charles Dillard Collins, "Iconographic Sources for the Sculptural Program at Elephanta," Diss. University of Iowa 1980, pp. 260-271. 2 A number of writers have discussed some or all of the sculptures within Elephanta, most often in pairs-as reliefs that face each other in the three porches, or as reliefs that seem compositionally similar, or as reliefs that offer thematic parallels or contrasts. They have not, however, gone beyond such pairings to indicate the overall or connected signifi- cance that these reliefs might have within the cave-temple. The only one to suggest an integrated program of reliefs and its meaning at Elephanta was the Rev. J. Stevenson, "The Theory of the Great Elephanta Cave," Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay, IV (July, 1852), 261-275, esp. 265 and 270: he associated a number of the Elephanta reliefs with the Linga Purdana and proposed that the five relief-sculptures along the southern wall, including the Siva Mahddeva/ Maheivara bust, reflected the tradition of "Unity and Trinity in the Deity" that is common to all ancient civilized nations; that the two panels on the north wall along with that of Siva dancing referred to the great struggles that Saivism under- went in its growth; and that the final relief of the ascetic Siva renders the calm that follows such struggles. The only other hints of which I am aware that Elephanta has a connected program were made by Stella Kramrisch, "The Image of Mahadeva in the Cave-Temple on Elephanta Island," Ancient India, No. 2 (July, 1946), p. 7 where she noted that "The plan of the rock-cut temple-and not only the disposition of the iWld-murtis [relief-panels]-was thus adjusted to the [Mahadeva/Mahegvara] image, the entire hall is laid out in front of it in its deep recess" and in her new authoritative iconographic study, The Presence of ?iva (Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1981), which contains an appendix on pp. 443- 468 with an eloquent stylistic analysis of Elephanta that complements her command of the stories found elsewhere in the book: she amplifies her earlier statement, noting the way that the Sadadiva (=Mahadeva/Maheivara in this article) bust flanked by Siva as Half-female and the Descent of Ganga dominates the cave-temple, and that the other relief "grottoes" in the three porches "arrest and attune to Siva's Wllas the devotee's circumambulation around the liniga shrine" (pp. 453-454); Kramrisch further notes the varied "resolution of the male-female concomitance" that is found in the Siva 605</page><page sequence="2">606 Journal of the American Oriental SocietY 102.4 (1982) and then indicate in what particular manner the ritual of the Lakuli~a-Padupatas might have related to the architectural layout at Elephanta. One of the sculpted images at Elephanta has been identified as the yogic figure of LakuliTa, the twenty- eighth and last incarnation of Siva according to the Puranas. LakulTha is also believed to have been the historical teacher who founded the LakulTla-Padupata sect of Saivas.3 Recent attempts to assemble relevant information about the sponsors of Elephanta have pointed to the Kalacuri dynasty, who proclaimed their devotion to the Padupata sect in their grants. They are believed to have been the only rulers in the immediate area with sufficient resources to support such a project and recently a number of copper coins of the Kalacuri king Krsnaraja (r.ca.550-575 A.D.) were found on Elephanta Island. On the basis of cumulative evidence, a date in the later sixth century A.D. appears to be justified for Elephanta.4 as Half-female, Descent of Ganga, and Marriage of Siva reliefs, but does not go beyond this and the beneficent- malevolent duality that is observed in at least one pair of reliefs, to indicate any more overall programmatic trend at Elephanta (pp. 455-456); and by Walter Spink, Ajanta to Ellora (Bombay: Marg Publications, [1967]), p. 66 where he observed that the reliefs with "Siva provided an organized series of votive points within the diagrammatically significant plan of the cave" and more recently in "Jogegwari: A Brief Analysis," The Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art: Dr. Moti Chandra Commemoration Volume (Part 11), ed. Umakant P. Shah and Krishna Deva (Calcutta, 1978), p. 17, he stated "The Main Hall ... becomes a kind of Mandala, a complex diagram filled with significant and integrated meanings"; and lastly by Benjamin Rowland, The Art and Architecture of India (3rd ed.; 1967; rpt. Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1971), p. 190 where he says, "The subsidiary tableaux at Elephanta are arranged like so many Stations of the Cross, each dedicated to a significant aspect of Siva Mahadeva." 3 Hirananda Sastri, A Guide to Elephanta (Delhi: Manager of Publications, 1934), pp. 33, 53-54; J.

There are two images of yogic Siva at Ele- phanta that have been proposed to represent Lakuliga: the major one is in the north porch of the main cave and another is in the west wing. Both are damaged and the normal cognizances of Lakuliga, a club and an erect phallus, are not now visible. Sastri, in his 1934 guide to Elephanta, was apparently the first to identify both figures as showing Lakullsa by comparison with an intact corresponding image in the Elephanta-inspired Cave 29 (Dhumar Lena) at Ellora (pp. 33, 53-54); this is the major positive evidence for such an identification, which is not accepted by all scholars. In common with the Ellora image, the damaged Elephanta reliefs have lotus seats beneath Siva, with nagas upholding their stalks, that are distinctive of Lakuliga compositions (as well as paralleling Buddhist Miracle at Sravastl reliefs)-see Collins, pp. 184-187. 4 V. V. Mirashi connected Elephanta to the Kalacuris on the basis of their Padupata sect affiliation, the figure of Siva as Lakullsa found in the ancillary west court at Elephanta, and their family resources to support such an extensive project-see Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi, ed., Inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi Era, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. IV, Pt. 1 (Ootacamund: Government Epigraphist for India, 1955), pp. cxlvii-cxlviii; at least thirty-one copper coins with Krsnaraja's likeness were found, exclusively on Elephanta Island, and six of these had his name inscribed in Brahm! characters similar to those on his silver issues found elsewhere-Shobhana Gokhale, "Elephanta Hoard of Copper Coins of Krsnaraja" (paper presented at the All India Numis- matic Conference, Indore, Oct. 2, 1975; copy sent to me by W. Spink), 4 pp. where she suggests that such low value coinage might have been distributed for the daily wages of workmen during excavation of the cave-temple; W. Spink reinforced the idea of Kalacuri sponsorship by tying it to the stylistic development from the Vakataka dynasty supported cave-temples at Ajanta, and to historical evidence gleaned from Dandin's seventh century prose romance, Dasakumdra- carita, that parallels the downfall of the Vakatakas-see Walter Spink, "Monuments of the Early Kalachuri Period," Journal of Indian History, XLVI (1968), 263-270 and his "Bagh: A Study," Archives of Asian Art, XXX (1976-1977), 55-59; known grants of the early Kalacuris date from Kala- curi Era (K.) 347 to 361=A.D. 596-611 under their third and fourth (final) rulers -see Mirashi, pp. 42-44, 51, 55-56; Dr. Spink concludes that Elephanta was completed under their second king, Krsnaraja, before A.D. 550, whereas I believe that Elephanta was more likely excavated under their third ruler, Sankaragana, who reigned ca. 575-600 (Mirashi, p. cxlviii, dates Elephanta to the last half of the sixth century "when the Kalachuri power was at its peak")-the reasons for this discrepancy within the sixth century are complex and not necessary to go into here, but the reader may consult Spink, AJanta, pp. 8-9, 50, 55, 64, 66 and Collins, pp. 14-19.</page><page sequence="3">COLLINS: Elephanta and the Ritual of the LakulIsa-Pis'upatas 607 ,]e w wX va s -- iva Siva ~~~~~~~~~~~~~Marriage and Parvati of Siva on a mountain and Parvati East 0 T iI- - West Court shrine ~~III7~~~~h7~~I?IIY-~~~~~ Court Ravana shaking Siva slaying Mt Kaildsa -- -- [ ---x- - - -- - | iva as Siva | FLakuiTsa dancing Plan, Elephanta Rock-cut Temple (one inch equals about 25 feet) In addition to standard literary sources, such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana epics, the Matsi'a, Vdmana and Linga Puranas, and secular works by the poet Kalidasa, all of which can be used to establish relationships between the relief-panels at Elephanta, two Lakuliga-Pagupata texts are available to compare with the sculptural program there. The more important of these sectarian sources is the Pd?upata Satra (PS) with its Paficdrtha-bhdsva (commentary) by Kaundinya that was published in 1940. The PS itself may have been composed in the first or second centuries A.D., and is traditionally attributed to LakulsTa. The commentary was added in the fifth or sixth centuries by Kaundinya, most likely before Elephanta was begun.5 The other sectarian text 5 The Pa-supata Su-tra is the oldest surviving text of the Pa5upata sect and may be the original one, since reference is made to it by every other text of the school or that is concerned with the school; the character of the text is primarily ritualistic and didactic, and it was intended solely</page><page sequence="4">608 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.4 (1982) for the LakullTa-Pasupatas is the Ganakdrikd (GK) with its Ratnatikd (or 77ka) commentary by Bhasar- vajnia which was published in 1920. The GK may have been compiled about a century before its bhdsya or sometime in the ninth century. The GK is much shorter than the PS but is more systematized than the earlier work on which it is based. It certainly dates later than the excavation of Elephanta but is valuable for its clarification of the PS.6 An important and distinctive ritual component in the PS that might be related to Elephanta is counter- clockwise ambulation, a reversal of the normal prac- tice (pradaksina) in India. The commentary to the sutra prescribing such action states that this normally inauspicious manner of movement is a method of worship similar to withdrawal of the senses and "by force of the image of [God] as the cause not only does the inauspicious become auspicious but circum- ambulation to the left becomes [as auspicious as] circumambulation to the right."7 In the context of Elephanta, this circumambulation could take place around the open interior of the cave-temple or, in a broad manner, around the liniga-shrine even though it is off-center (see plan). It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the eight major relief-panels at Elephanta, not necessarily in- cluding the colossal three-faced bust of Siva as Mahadeva or Maheivara, might be connected in some way with this counterclockwise ambulation.8 Several of the epic and Puranic texts named above can be for practitioners of the sect; the published text was based on two imperfect manuscripts, but it has been translated by Hara in his dissertation on Pasupata sources (n. 3 above) and by H. Chakraborti (see below). See R.

Wearing the cord apasavva means wearing it over the right shoulder. In apasavya circum- ambulation the worshipper begins by stepping to his right and continues in circumambulation of the object to be worshipped, keeping his left side toward it. This means of course that he turns constantly to the left as he makes his circle. It is possible that in giving the etymological sense of apasavya Kaundinya intends it to refer to the wearing of the sacred cord as well as to circumambulation. 8 It may be pertinent in this regard that several writers on Elephanta have discussed the reliefs in a counterclockwise order, although without indicating a reason: Kanaiyalal H. Vakil, Rock-Cut Temples Around Bomba': at Elephanta and Jogeshwari, Mandapeshwar and Kanheri (Bombay: D. B. Taraporevala Sons &amp; Co., 1932), pp. 27-57; Sastri, Elephanta, pp. 25-55; and Muriel Neff, "IV. Sculpture," Marg, XIII, No. 4 (1960), 32-44-each writer discusses the reliefs beginning with that of Siva dancing in the north portico and ending with Siva as yogi, which is opposite it. Kramrisch, "Image of Mahadeva," p. 5 fig. I shows a plan of the cave-temple with the reliefs numbered counterclockwise from Siva Mahadeva/ Mahesvara to the Descent of Ganga. Ratan Parimoo, "Elephanta in the Context of Evolution and Significance of Saiva Sculpture," Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, XXVI, No. 3 (1977), figs. 17, 18 numbers the reliefs in the plans of both Elephanta and Ellora Cave 29 counterclockwise. Through all of these references, it is as if there was some implied logic in this anticlockwise order.</page><page sequence="5">COLLINS: Elephanta and the Ritual of the LakulTa-Pdiupatas 609 used to demonstrate some connections between stories relating to most of the reliefs in this sequence. The first relief encountered upon entering Elephanta through the right side of the main east portico depicts the demon Ravana shaking Mt. Kailasa (Rdvandnugra- hamirti, or showing favor to Ravana), upon which giva and Parvat! are seated (see plan). This panel does not appear to relate strongly to the one following, but its significance may correspond to a sectarian point. In Kalidasa's epic poem Raghuvamsra (The Dynasty of Raghu), Rama as an incarnation of Visnu admires Ravana because, among other things, the latter had worshipped giva.9 Implicit in such a narrative is at What perhaps further supports this order is that other author- ities discuss the reliefs in a more disjunct way, jumping from one side of the cave to the other, and only one appears to have considered the reliefs in a purely clockwise manner-a sequence that one would think the norm in discussing an Indian sacred monument. Reproductions of all the Elephanta relief-sculptures may be found in either Sastri, Elephanta, Pis. VII-XVI or Neff, figs., 2, 9, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 25, 27 and 29, and many of them also in Kramrisch, Presence, Pls. 1-25. It may be appropriate to mention here that the accounts of Vakil, Sastri and Neff began and ended their discussions with reliefs in the north portico of the cave, which is con- sidered by them to represent the limit of the main axis (north-south) of Elephanta. A glance at the plan, however, will confirm that the lihga-shrine is set off from the north- south axis that culminates in the bust of Mahadeva I Maheivara. The linga-shrine is the focal point of the axis leading from east to west and, since the linga is the quintes- sential symbol of Siva and that which precedes any of the deity's anthropomorphic manifestations, therefore it is this axis that takes precedence. A more detailed plan of the cave (e.g., Kramrisch, Presence, p. 444) also shows a more elabo- rate staircase at the east porch and, directly in front of it on an axis with the lifga-shrine, an empty circular base where Siva's bull Nandi may originally have been placed facing the shrine. See note 36 below for possible ritual implications of the north-south secondary axis. Spink, "Jogegwarli," pp. 15-16 has proposed the possibility that since the Mahadeva/ Maheivara bust with the flanking panels of Siva Half-female and the Descent of Ganga are found neither at Ellora Cave 29 nor at the Jogegwaff (Yogeg- vanf) cave-temple outside Bombay, although these two sites do contain the remaining six subjects found in the reliefs at Elephanta, that the original intent might have been to pro- vide a fourth entrance at the south side of Elephanta ap- proached by a long tunnel; technical problems might have caused the abandonment of the idea and the three reliefs were then carved as "inspired ... afterthoughts." Though this might help explain the absence of these reliefs at Jogeg- wanf, which is believed to precede Elephanta, it hardly seems to do justice to their grandeur and symbolism, and might further complicate the reason for the off-center linga-shrine (especially if an "auspicious arrangement" to coincide with the vdstupurusamandala was desired-see p. 14). Spink also underscores "the primacy of the east-west axis" and the technical difficulties involved in establishing it (pp. 16-17). 9 XII.87-89: Robert Antoine, trans., Kalidasa: The Dynasty of Raghu (Calcutta: Writers Workshop, 1972), p. 144; the dating of the epics and Purdnas as well as of Kalidasa's works is both hypothetical and conjectural, but for purposes of this essay both of the epics, the MatsI'a Purdna and Kalidasa's writings are believed to precede the excavation of Elephanta in the sixth century; the Kirma, Lihga, Vdmana and Visnudharmottara Purdnas were begun by the sixth century but were finished later-for a summary of the prob- lem, see Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Hindu Myths (1975; rpt. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1976), pp. 16-18. Jus- tification for the inclusion of Kalidasa's works as the only secular sources lies in several areas: he was a votary of Siva and was connected with the western India city of Ujjain, which was a prominent center of Saivism; it is often surmised that he served the Gupta emperor Candragupta II (roca. 375- 415) who made that city his capital in the Malwa region; the Kalacuri ruler Sankaragana (r.ca. 575-600), who succeeded Krsnaraja, emulated Gupta epithets for the first time in his Abhdna grant of K.347=A.D. 596-597, issued from Ujjain upon his conquering Malwa-see Daniel H.

Finally, it may not be simply fortuitous in this context to note that PS 1. I bhasva states "God in the shape of man took the form of a Brahmana and became incarnated in Kayavatarana. And he walked on foot to Ujjain-lV (Chakraborti, p. 49); thus, Lakuliga presumably established his teachings in the same city where Kalidasa later lived.</page><page sequence="6">610 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.4 (1982) least a respect if not a more direct obeisance of Rama for Siva. In this case, Siva is able to vanquish the great demon of the Ramayana without resorting to extraordinary lengths he merely presses his foot down to contain the mountain-moving demon. So the devotee would be shown a lesson in sectarian superi- ority upon entering Elephanta. The following three sculpture-panels at Elephanta Siva as a yogi (Yogesamarti; equivalent to LakulTga here), Siva dancing (Nrittamarti) and Siva slaying the demon Andhaka (Andhakdsuravadhamarti) have con- nected themes in the Vdmana Purdna: within the extensively narrated Andhaka story, while the gods and demons are fighting, Siva performed meditation and later danced vigorously by twirling his long arms. "Having performed Sandhyd (meditation) and having danced to the utmost of his desire, he again made up his mind for battle with the demons." Siva then conquered Andhaka and granted him a boon of re- moving his evil nature so he would be perpetually devoted to God. Finally, Siva turned Andhaka into lord of his ganas (attendants).10 This transformation of Andhaka into a ganapati is also found in the Matsvia, Kirma and Linga Purinas, and it is paral- leled in the goal of the Padupata Saivas (see below).' The Linga Purana connects Siva as a yogi and Siva dancing when it says, "Others [sages including Sanaka] are of the opinion that the Tandava [a dance per- formed at dusk] of the lord is due to the Bliss of yoga."'2 In Kalidasa's lyric poem Meghaduita (The Cloud Messenger), the evocative passage describing the arrival of the cloud at the Siva temple called Mahakala at Ujjain is viewed by Daniel H. H. Ingalls as the sequel to the yogic Siva: the dancing girls at the temple perform at sunset, evoking the "creative, erotic, nature of giva."13 The next verse tells the cloud to . . .offer yourself to Shiva for the elephant's bloody hide He wears in His [Pagupati's] dance. In the Andhaka relief at Elephanta, Siva holds the elephant's hide as a cape behind him and dances ominously as he slays the demon. The narrative there- fore shows the dance of creation preceding the dance of destruction in the same order it is found at Elephanta. The Slayer of Andhaka relief is opposite the Mar- riage of giva and PdrvatT scene (Kal'dnasundara- mi7rti) in the west portico. In Kalidasa's epic poem Kurndrasambhava (The Birth of the War God), a passage on the marriage preparations describes Siva in his "dire vesture" as sporting a withered skull, an elephant's hide, a terrifying third eye, and twining serpents as well as being covered with dust (ashes? see below for significance) before he was transformed into a "gentle bridegroom."' This description is simi- lar to the figure of the demon-slayer at Elephanta and again parallels the sequence of both reliefs there. The Marriage of Siva episode is likewise connected with that of the next panel, Siva as Supporter of Ganga (Gahgadharamirti), in several sources. The Mahabharata mentions both Parvati and Ganga as spouses of giva. In the Ramayana, the narrative of Ganga and her descent to earth forms a sequel to the marriage episode. The Matsya Purana tells of the seven sages' request of diva that he have an offspring by ParvatT to quell a demon.

The Descent of Ganga and the next narrative relief, Siva as Half-female and Half-male (ArdhandrTsvara- murti), both of which flank the large triple-faced bust of Siva Mahadeva or Mahesvara at Elephanta, are paralleled in the Mahabharata in terms of creation. With reference to Gafiga, the gods convince Siva not to unite with ParvatT because the two would create an offspring who would consume the world. Siva, how- ever, inadvertently released a small quantity of energy that was cast by Agni into the River Ganga where Skanda (Karttikeya) was produced to rid the world of a demon. Thus, Ganga was the carrier of Siva's son. For Siva as Half-female, this epic states that the deity, "displays in his form the indications of both the sexes as the one cause of the creation of the universe."" The final narrative relief in this anti-clockwise sequence at Elephanta shows Siva and ParvatT upon a mountain often identified as Mt. Kailasa (Umdmahes'a- murti). The scene is difficult to identify due to its damaged condition, but it is a domestic tableau with a child held by an attendant in the background. If the child is meant to be emphasized, this panel could form a sequel to the creation imagery found in the previous two relief-panels in the cave-temple. The Matsv a Purana describes the divine couple in their mountain home after their marriage. During a dice game, a loud uproar causes in inquiry by ParvatT. Siva says that his attendant ganesIvaras, who were virtuous human beings that he elevated to a deified state and whom he favored over the other gods, were sporting on the mountain. Parvati was impressed by one of them who Siva identified as VTraka or Vira- bhadra, who was Siva's personal favorite. ParvatT wished to have a son like him, so Siva granted him to her as a boon and she cherished him. "It is this Viraka that became the real son of the DevT on some future occasion."' In addition to foreshadowing the births of Siva and ParvatT's offspring, Skanda and Ganega, the VTraka story symbolizes the goal of the PaMupata 16 Kisari Mohan Ganguli, trans. and Pratap Chandra Roy, publ., The Mahahharata of Krishna-Dwaipavana Vvasa, IV, 3rd ed.

It is conceivable, due to the fact that all of the relief subjects found at Elephanta are present at Jogeswari and Ellora Cave 29 except Siva Half-female, the Siva Mahadeva,;' Mahesvara bust and the Descent of Ganga (see Spink, "Jogegwarfi," p. 15), that the integrated sequence should move directly from the Marriage of Siva to this final relief of the divine couple on the mountain; in other words, that the other three reliefs intrude upon the rest of the program and may have had a different significance intended. In that case, the final domestic scene is a logical sequel to the marriage, with or without emphasis on the child, as in the Matsva Purdna account. What then is the significance of the other three reliefs? The Mahadeva/ Mahesvara bust is separate to begin with due to its iconic character; it represents an intermediary stage be- tween the aniconic linga of Siva and the fully manifested scenes in the other reliefs. The Descent of Ganga, in which the triple bust of Ganga presses down on Siva's locks, might contain esoteric symbolism connected with Pasupata ritual: PS 11.16 bhhjsia tells of the three means to the Pasupata goal (transcendent gifts or atiddna meaning the giving of one's self to God, transcendent sacrifices or atii'ajana meaning serving God with offerings such as the six ritual acts in the temple and courting dishonor in public, and transcendent asceticism or atitupa meaning enduring the dishonor pro- voked in public) and that "By these three means his merit flows in and his demerit flows out after the fashion of the current of the Ganges"-see Hara, "Materials," pp. 5, 291, Chakraborti, pp. 111-113, Collins, pp. 221-222, 232-233, and Minoru Hara, "Pasupata and Samkhya-Yoga," Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, XXXIV-XXXV (1973), 78 where he indicates that these means are peculiar to Pdsupata Saivism and not to Sam.khya or Yoga. This is incidentally the only mention of Ganga in the PS. As to any analogous symbolism of Siva Half-female, I am not sure. The only reference in the PS that to my mind might provide an allegory is 1.44 bhhs va concerning Siva as the source of creation: "Here the cause (karana) has the power of produc- ing, preserving and dissolving, while the effect (karya) is possessed of the quality of being produced, preserved and dissolved" (Chakraborti, p. 97). Since the female part of Siva was derived from the male half, perhaps the male reflects the cause and the female the effect-cf.

This brief discussion indicates some of the more prominent relationships that can be made using stan- dard sources to interpret the Elephanta reliefs. Return- ing from these broad-based literary sources to the sectarian PS and GK with their commentaries, the ritualistic emphasis of these Pasupata texts precludes making the descriptive relationships of the kind indi- cated above for the Elephanta reliefs. The sculpture of Siva incarnated as yogic LakulTga is important not only for showing the sect's founder but also because of the implications of yoga for the Pasupatas. The commentary to PS 1. 1 states that yoga "means the conjunction of the (individual) soul with God through the intellect." This union with God is considered to be the perfection of yoga and by virtue of it, the yogin attains a status above the other gods, the cessation of sorrows, and the acquisition of merit; he acquires the ability to change forms at will and thus assumes similar powers to those of Mahesvara (Siva). The adept is said to become "the Great chief of the Ganas of Bhagavan Mahadeva" upon attaining the marks of spiritual success.'9 Ingalls sums up the Pasupata ideal: The ultimate goal was freedom (moksa), which they understood to mean not only freedom from suffering, but freedom to act without any let. The latter implied omnipotence, the being beyond the power of all others and the having of all others within one's power (P.S.I, 27-28), i.e., the nature of Rudra-Siva himself.20 The distinctive emphasis on association with the Godhead found in this system would lend an unusual dual role to the sculptural program at Elephanta. Not only is one seeing religious symbols which remind the adherent of their prototypes, but these are also visions of what the untrammeled devotee might be able to attain by the grace of his God. This gives a richer context to the panel of Siva as Lakulisa: we are witnessing the descent of the God in human form as founder of the sect and, conversely, a paradigm of the Pasupata aspirant raised to an exalted status of unin- hibited sovereignty. Besides the eight narrative panels in Elephanta with their relationships including the distinctly sectarian image of Siva as LakulTga, the large three-faced bust of Siva as Mahadeva or Mahesvara (Mahesamarti) in the center of the south wall is an important com- plement of the quintessential lihga-shrine, due to the former's iconic character and axial placement. The Mahadeva/ Mahegvara image appears, from the socket holes in its threshhold, to have been concealed on occasion, so that its meaning could have been inten- tionally more subtle than that of the other reliefs. It represented a symbolic focal point for meditation and, although it might not normally have been open to view, was sculpted to indicate that behind the screen really existed the manifested Lord.2' Descriptions of Siva in both Pasupata texts em- phasize a three-fold deity, rather than the more typical five-faced lifiga, the five-formed Pafica Brahmans, or the five-faced Sambhu that are known respectively from the Kirma, Linga, and Visnudharmottara 19 Chakraborti, PS 1. I bhdsya (p. 52), V.33 bhdsya (p. 176), V.39 bhdsya (p. 184), V.40 bhdsyya (pp. 185-188), 1.24 and its bhdsja (p. 87) that states "By his [the adept's] power of supremacy he is identical with Mahesvara," and finally 1.38 bhdsva (p. 93) which says that the eight marks or qualities of spiritual success are the conditions of being uncontrollable, not to be overpowered, not to be killed, fearlessness, indes- tructibility, freedom from old age, freedom from death, and unobstructed movement. 20 Ingalls, "Cynics," p. 292; cf. Dasgupta, p. 147, Lorenzen, p. 19 1, and Hara, "PaTupata and Sam.khya-Yoga," pp. 76-87 for a lucid discussion of the Pasupata goal, which is variously referred to as atigati, vikarana and duhkhdnta. 2' An observation by V. S. Agrawala, Siva Mahadeva: the great God (Varanasi: Prithivi Prakashan, 1966), p. 24 con- cerning the manifestations of Siva may be appropriate in this context: "In fact, Siva in his absolute form is One, but in his differentiated form he becomes Trimiurti, that is, the pos- sessor of the Triple Form and the Trimurti is conceived of as Ashtamiirti, the owner of Eight Forms." The statement is made without reference to Elephanta and might indicate the general interrelationship between respectively the lifiga- shrine, the bust of Siva Mahadeva/ Mahesvara, and the eight narrative panels in the cave-temple. Agrawala elsewhere (p. 60), however, describes the Elephanta bust of Siva as representing the five-faced paiiabrahma concept of the God -see n. 22 below. The eight forms of Siva are commonly mentioned in literature, for example in the invocation to Kaliddsa's ?dkuntala. The problem is that I have not been able to make a reasonably direct correlation between the astamartis, which consist of the five gross elements, the sun, the moon and the mind/sacrificer/priest, and the relief- sculptures at Elephanta.</page><page sequence="9">COLLINS: Elephanta and the Ritual of the LakulTsa-Pdiupatas 613 Purdnas22 In the PS, Siva is described as the Rsi (seer), Vipra (learned), and either Adhipati (presiding deity) or Mahan (superior, best, distinguished).23 The triple function is emphasized in the passage, "The Lord is nothing but a player and He creates, protects and destroys three types of karya [effect] known as vidya [knowledge], kala [material components] and Pagu [cattle]."24 In Chapter II of the PS on effect and cause, Siva is spoken of as the cause (kdrana) in terms of Vamadeva, Jyestha and Rudra as follows: Vama means the best or the beautiful one, Deva signifies playing in the sense that Siva "produces, changes and dissolves three types of karya-s vidya, kala and pagu"; Jyestha signifies the Highest Being in the sense of the Supreme power of knowledge and movement; and Rudra means that He unites the created world or its "beings with various types of actions and fear."25 The importance of these many terms is to define qualities of Siva that might be worshipped as an aid 22 The five-faced linga or paiicdyatana form of Siva named Omkara that has five imports, namely, ultra-calmness, learn- ing, excellent art, stability, and cessation, is found in Gupta, Karma Purina, 1.30.1-8 (p. 213); the "Pafica Brahmans" form of Siva described as Sadyojata, Vamadeva, Tatpurusa, Aghora and Eana, is enunciated and explained-including the countenance for each of the faces-in Shastri, Linga- Purdna, VI, 11.14.1-33 (pp. 651-653) and Shastri, Liiga- Purdna, V, 1.10.42-53 (pp. 46-47), 1.11 to 1.16 (pp. 47-58), and cf. 1.23.1-29 (pp. 86-88); the five-faced Sambhu form of Siva is described in dual epithets as Sadyojata-Mahadeva, Vdmadeva-Umavaktra, Aghora-Bhairava, Tatpurusa- Nandivaktra, and ITana-Saddgiva in the Visnudharmottara (Upa-)Purdna-see 111.48.1-8 in Stella Kramrisch, trans., The Vishnudharmottara (Part III): A Treatise on Indian Painting and Image-Making, 2nd ed.

The Visnudharmottara has been drawn on by scholars such as Kramrisch and Banerjea as a major source for identifying the faces of the Mahadeva/ Mahesvara bust at Elephanta; this text, however, beyond indicating natural elements, directions and attributes for each of the faces and their corresponding hands, which are not directly applicable to Elephanta, indicates the expression of only the Bhairava face as being terrific (raudra); Kramrisch, "Image of Maha- deva," pp. 6-8 proceeded to apply the names Tatpurusa, Aghora (described as fierce, terrific and wrathful), and Vama- deva (handsome, 'woman's delight,' equivalent to Siva's Sakti --Uma or Parvati) to the center, proper right and proper left faces of the Elephanta image using corroborating but later sources such as the IRdnasivagurudevapaddhati (an Agama or Tantra) and the R paman~dana (a Vastugastra), stating on p. 6 n. 9 that, The dh'ana.slokas in the various texts are not iden- tical in detail. There are as many, if not necessarily the same, variations there as in the images. The vision held by signs and words is the same: different ages and different schools see it under particular modifi- cations. In the recent study, THe Presence of ?iva, she underscores the above identifications which along with the invisible rear and top faces form the five-faced Sadasiva, whose iconogra- phy is outlined in an eleventh century ritual text, Somasam- bhupaddhati-see p. 446 and n. 6, and cf. pp. 178-189. Banerjea, p. 131 used the terrific countenance of Bhairava and the relative sequence of directions from the Visnudhar- mottara for the faces at Elephanta, beginning with Mahadeva/ Mahesvara facing east as the central face (that is, the north- ern face at Elephanta) since "the shrines usually face east" and the face would then be aligned along one of the two major axes in the cave-temple (see plan)-his sequence is essentially like that of Kramrisch above; for further dis- cussion, see Collins, pp. 141-147. I do not intend to make light of the fact that each of the five chapters of the PS ends by invoking one of the five mantras-Sadyojata, Vamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusa and Tgana being their initial words-that originate in the Tait- tiriva Arani'aka X.43-47, and which are prescribed in the sixth mode of worship (see below) and elsewhere in the PS. Kramrisch maintains the priority of these Vedic mantras in identifying the three-headed bust of Siva as Saddgiva, a variation of a paiicamukha-linga, that is, even though only three faces are visible, five are implied (Presence, pp. 445- 446 and cf. 177-189, 244, 255). The matter is obviously a complex one, involving philosophical and categorical distinc- tions between the Samkhyas, Yogas and the Pdsupatas, as well as artistic precedents and usage, and so requires a more thorough treatment than is possible here. In a separate article on a reevaluation of this Mahadeva/ Mahesvara image at Elephanta, I will amplify my proposal that the sculpture represents a triune concept. 23 PS 1.9 hhdsva, V.26 and hhdsva: Chakraborti, pp. 61, 171-172. 24 PS 1.9 bhdsiXa: Chakraborti, p. 61. 25 PS 11.1-4 and bhhdsva, 11.22 and bhdsta: Chakraborti, pp. 98-99, 116; also Hara, "Materials," pp. 296-297 and cf.

The terms that refer most closely to the functions of creation, protection and destruction are Vdmadeva for Creator, Jyestha for Protector and Rudra for Destroyer. Attributes are not discussed in the PS or in the GK to aid in applying these names to the sculpture at Elephanta. Using the meanings of the names as indicators, how- ever, it would seem that Vamadeva, the beautiful one, could apply to the proper left or feminine face, that Jyestha as the Highest or Eldest Being could refer to the central one, and that Rudra as the cause of fear could fit the agitated proper right face. This sequence would conform with a counterclockwise ambulation of the cave-temple; even if the sculpture was con- cealed, the logic of its conception with relation to the rest of the cave would prevail. The aspirant would encounter the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer in order, with the visage of the Preserver appropriately in the center facing front, since the universe has already been created and has not yet been destroyed. With these preliminary ideas in mind, the ritual of the Lakullsa-Pasupatas may now be outlined from both sectarian texts and then its relationship to Elephanta suggested. The more systematic formula of the GK with its Ratnatikd commentary delineates good conduct as one of five ways to approach the Pasupata goal. Conduct is further broken down into two categories and the primary one or the main regimen consists of bathing and lying in ashes, offering (upahdra), prayer (japa) and circum- ambulation (pradaksina). It is called the main regi- men, because it is performed directly and primarily to bring about merit and destroy demerit.26 Thus it is part of a larger though integrated program which the initiate undergoes. In both the PS and GK, the worshipper is instructed to cleanse (actually void himself), prepare ashes, and cover the entire body with ashes while praying to Rudra. Upon finishing this 'bath', he goes praying to the temple where he pays respect to Siva and announces his deed to the God. In the GK, he then enters the inner shrine, falls "to his knees there in a spot to the south of the image" and "renders homage in his heart, looking upon Siva in the image as God himself." The PS states that, "after he has arrived, his first prayer of 'om, om, om' is to achieve withdrawal of the sense-organs (pratvd- hara)" and the GK explains this by saying, one will see that it follows of necessity that the worshipper must go and, facing north with self-control pray for complete withdrawal of his senses. Then only after praying and when he is plunged in meditation upon Siva should he repeat again and again the wild laugh (attahdsa). 27 Laughter is the first of six forms of worship that are to take place in the temple. The character of each is explained in both the PS and the GK: 1. Laughter is a wild laugh, with the throat and lips wide open (PS). 2. Song "is performed according to the rules of the Gdndharvasaistra and in which, in public hearing, the names of God, those which derive from his qualities, his substances, and his acts, are called to mind" (PS);28 while singing, the adept rises to his feet (GK). 3. "DANCE is what is performed according to the rules of the Ndtrvadstra and consists of [all pos- sible] motions of the hands and feet: upward, downward, inward, outward and shaking motion" (PS); it should be accompanied by song (PS and GK). 4. "DLUMDUMKiRA [Hudukkira per GK] is the sacred sound like the bellowing of a bull, pro- duced by the contact of the tongue-tip with the palate" (PS); this is performed after the dance when the devotee has again sat down and is still meditating on Siva (GK). 5. Inner worship or namaskira is to be done mentally only (PS). 6. "PRAYER is thinking and reflecting with the mind on the meaning (hhiva) of each successive syl- lable and line of the mantras, sadi'o'dta, etc." (PS). The GK notes that laughing, singing and hu~duk-kara are verbal, dancing is bodily, and inner worship and prayer are mental.29 26 GK 7 bhdyva: Hara, "Materials," p. 546. 27 GK 7 hdsva and PS 1.8 hhdasva: Hara, "Materials," pp. 549, 181. 28 PS 1.8 bhdsv'a: Hara, "Materials," p. 182 where it is also said that the songs may be in Sanskrit or Prakrit and be composed by the devotee or by others. 29 PS 1.8 and hhdvsva, GK 7 hhdsva: Hara, "Materials," pp. 181-183, 549-550; these are found in much the same way in Sdyana Mddhava-see Hara, "Pdgupata-Darianam," pp. 26-27; it is realized that the instructions in the GK are of a later date than those in the PS, but both texts are very similar in this section so that their collective use is justified.</page><page sequence="11">COLLINS: Elephanta and the Ritual of the Lakull-s'a-Pds'upatas 615 The six modes of worship or offerings (upahdras) as they are called take place, according to PS 1.9, in the area "Of the Great God conceived in His Southern Image" or "On the right side of the image of Ma- hadeva."30 It is further explained that southern is a direction that is divided or particularized by the sun, and the image in turn is so divided. The image means "whatever a man sees to the southern side of God when he stands nearby facing north" or what the devotee "seated near the right side of the Lord with his face turned north realizes."3' The image(s) is then said to be characterized by vrsadhvaja (bull banner), idulapdni (holding a trident), Nandin (Siva's bull), Mahakala (in the form of Fate), and ardhvalihga (with erect penis). Since the southern image or Dak- sinamurti is mentioned, images on or of the east, west and north are disregarded or excluded.32 The GK continues that after the six-fold worship is completed, one meditates on the God and declares that he will perform the avabhrthasndna or purifica- tory ablution. "He should then depart, making obei- sance to the Lord and after the obeisance slowly circumambulate [the image] three times while pray- ing." After he performs the ablution, he pays homage to the teachers of the sect ano does one circum- ambulation. Then he performs certain meditative practices near to, but outside of, the temple. This completes the prescribed regimen for the first religious stage.33 This is quite specific information regarding sectarian ritual; the question is how it might have related to Elephanta.34 It seems doubtful that the six acts of worship would be performed in a sequence relating individually to the reliefs in the cave. The order of activity from the Padupata texts indicates that upon entering the sanctuary, the devotee first kneels, then meditates, then rises for the dance, then sits again to meditate, performs the purifying ablution, circum- ambulates the image three times, pays respect to the teachers, and finally circumambulates once more be- fore leaving the temple. There is, of course, a problem with circumambulating an image in the cave-temple because only the lifiga-shrine is literally capable of being circumscribed, whereas none of the reliefs in- cluding the Mahadeva/Mahesvara bust are. The action taking place is on one individual's part and initiative, but it is likely that more than a single person would be undergoing devotions at one time not synchronized, however, as in congregational worship. Space is needed for meditation, dance, cir- cumambulation and ablution. Ablution would most likely take place in the shrine, where the lifga could be anointed. Circumambulation would logically take place around the shrine or, since the idea of image is implicit, around the interior of the entire cave passing by the eight narrative reliefs. Meditation would require an area away from walk- ways; it seems unlikely, however, that it would tran- spire in the diminutive cells next to the relief-panels of Siva Half-female and the Descent of Ganga. With reference to the architectural layout, William Erskine noted as far back as 1813 that ceiling beams or architraves (which connect each row of interior col- umns along east-west axes-see plan) are used as well to cut-off laterally the two rows of four pillars leading from the main eastern entrance to the linga-shrine. This creates a rectangular space and if draperies or such were hung from these beams, a separate room within Elephanta could have been produced.35 This area is the only other available space in the cave-temple with sufficient room to accommodate a 30 Respectively, Hara, "Materials," p. 184 and Chakraborti, p. 61. 3P1PS 1.9 hhdsva: respectively, Hara, "Materials," p. 185 and Chakraborti, p. 62. 32 PS 1.9 hhdsva: Hara, "Materials," pp. 184-186 and Chakraborti, pp. 61-62. G33K 7 hdsva: Hara, "Materials," pp. 551-552. 14 Several cautions are appropriate at the outset: the rela- tion of sectarian liturgy to early temples in India is largely unexplored territory due to the paucity of texts or to the poor condition of the monuments or both; later texts or practices are sometimes related to earlier monuments without an iconological or a theological understanding of what early practices might have been-even if an earlier temple is similar in form to later ones, it does not follow that practices would necessarily be the same, even within the traditional context of religion in India; the layout and nature of the reliefs at Elephanta may not per se relate to Pdsupata liturgy even if they do retain its symbolism because of secular dictates of its patrons, a prerequisite that is the rule rather than the exception in Indian temples whatever their affilia- tion; as specific as the Pdaupata texts are, they do not refer to any particular temple; and portions of their ritual may have been secret or transmitted orally or else are in lost texts. Therefore, this qualifies any statements that are made regarding their ritual vis-i-vis Elephanta and relegates any conclusions to working hypotheses subject to revision. 3 William Erskine, "Account of the Cave-Temple of Ele- phanta, with a plan and drawings of the principal figures: Read November 22, 1813," Transactions of the Literary SocietI' of Bombay, 1, 218, 234-235.</page><page sequence="12">616 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.4 (1982) number of meditating ascetics. It is sufficiently marked off by architectural elements so as not to require screens hung from the architrave level, but if necessity or occasion warranted, this could easily have been done. Conversely, this would help explain why short transverse beams were used to connect these rows of four pillars each: they inhibit a clear view of the shrine from the entrance but their ritual function necessitated an alteration of normal visual principles. The dance is the remaining portion of the liturgy to require space. It is possible that the devotee simply rose to his feet from meditating and danced in place within the rectangular "cloister," but it would seem at least as logical to step out of the area-especially since practitioners in the meditative posture would be variously laughing, making the dum~dumkdra or huduk- kara sound, in inner worship, or in prayer according to their stage in the regimen. The dance is performed only once in the sequence and probably not for an excessive length of time, although it could vary with the individual worshipper. It could easily be accom- modated in the long aisle to either side of the "cloister" (or in one of them), especially if limited to the area within two intercolumniations from the linga-shrine. In this case, it would not impede others who might be circumambulating, since they could follow the re- entrant angles of the cave walls between the porches while passing by the reliefs. Homage to the teachers of the sect would probably take place near the LakulTsa image in the north portico.36 A final problem relates to PS 1.9 (and bhds va) concerning the image-"Mahadevasya Daksinamfir- teh"37-meaning either southern image or that the devotee is on the right side of the image. It is quite difficult to know how to apply any directional sym- bolism to Elephanta, since it was rock-cut and direc- tions are at least partly programmed into the nature of the site.38 The Mahadeva/ Mahesvara bust of Siva does happen to be on the south side of the cave- temple, but this is probably coincidence. The exten- sion in the cave of the "cloister" is to the front and proper right side of the colossal image. The commen- tary to PS 1.9 describes characteristics of apparently 36 I do not wish to belabor this theory by associating it with other monuments, but it might be capable of being applied to Ellora Cave 29 or to the dynamic, transitional plan of the Jogegwarl cave, where the adaptation of a Buddhist vihdra plan is evident-see Spink, A/janta, pp. 18, 21 and his "Jogegwar!," pp. 1-35. Concerning the secondary north-south axis at Elephanta mentioned in note 8 above, the ritual act of homage to the teachers might help to explain why an unimpeded axis from the manifested form of Siva Mahadeva/ Mahesvara to the image of Siva as Lakuliga would be desirable. The only other functional reason for the offsetting of the linga-shrine would seem to be to produce the rectangular "cloister" for the devotees, an area that would not have been possible with a centrally placed shrine. This raises the question to what extent structural or ritual expediency might have over- shadowed adherence to transcendent design, such as con- forming to a vdstupurusamandala. Kramrisch emphasizes that the east-west axis leads to the unmanifest Siva within the linga, and the north-south axis leads to the manifest or iconic form of Siva (Presence, pp. 445-446 and cf. 162-189, esp. 165, 168, 174, 177). Kramrisch had earlier noted in a general context that, "Pradaksina in a Saiva temple, is not performed by going round and round the temple as in temples of other gods, but from the Bull toCanda (whose image is stationed to the west of the Northern 'door'; I.P. III.XII.59) and back to Nandin, thence to the Somasfitra, the water chute, and back again to Nandin, thence to Canda and from there again to the Bull" -Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol. 11 (1946; rpt. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1977), p. 300 n. 1. The apparent source for this practice is the late text I.P.=Ts-naswivaguru- devapaddhati mentioned in note 22 above. This suggests a multi-axis approach within the temple, although probably not along perpendicular axes. At Elephanta, Siva dancing is in the position prescribed for Canda. The PS does not contain any similar ritual, however. The only other functional analogy that comes to mind for the use of multiple entrances in an Indian sacred monument is in a Buddhist context: of the three entrances to the caitya- hall at KdrlT, for example, it has been noted that the central one was reserved for priests and monks, whereas lay devotees would enter and exit only through the side entrances that led to an ambulatory around the stipa-see Percy Brown, Indian Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu Periods) 3rd rev. ed.

I hesitate to apply this formula to Elephanta because there is no corroborating evidence, but merely mention it as a remote possibility. Chakraborti, p. 61. 38 Problems concerning the application of directional sym- bolism to multi-faced Mahesamfirti (-Mahadeva, Maheg- vara) images of Siva in the Linga and Visnudharmotiara Purdnas are alluded to in n. 22 above and are discussed in Collins, pp. 142-147 and cf. 195-196.</page><page sequence="13">COLLINS: Elephanta and the Ritual of the Lakullsa-PaiuPatas 617 more than one image, but is specific on the exclusion of images relating to other directions. If the devotee was in the "cloister" area facing north, only the Ravana and possibly the dancing Siva images would be visible, but at oblique angles. In this instance, proximity to an image or images may be one thing but the realization of an image quite another; four of the six acts of worship are enacted within a meditative state in which ordinary perception would be severely limited. In the song and dance portions, the aspirant is preoccupied so that only in the post-ablution period of circumambulation could the images be perceived, if even then because prayer accompanies this act too. Therefore, realization of the image(s) is probably in- tended to be a mental process during the regimen.39 It could be that after worship, ablution and homage to the sect teachers has all taken place, that the final circumambulation before leaving the temple would pass by and end at the relief of Siva and ParvatT on the mountain, across from the initial Ravana panel in the east porch. This scene apparently relates in a greater or lesser way to an offspring of the divine couple. If, for the sake of argument, we apply the Matsya Purdna account mentioned above, then the Pasupata aspirant would be graphically reminded that he too, like Viraka or VTrabhadra or by extension Ganega or Karttikeya, would eventually become de- ified as a legitimate progeny vested with superhuman powers like the great Lord Siva.40 39 The only alternative appears to be if we assume that the Mahadeva/ Mahesvara bust at Elephanta collectively repre- sents the Siva image(s) mentioned in the text and if the devotee was in the western bay of the "cloister" facing south on-axis towards the bust image, but this does not seem to be a very logical possibility whether or not the image was concealed behind a screen. 40 I wish to express my gratitude to Professor Wayne Begley of The University of Iowa for his encouragement and scholarly insights, and to Professor James Campbell of Eisenhower College, Rochester Institute of Technology, for his astute suggestions on the manuscript.</page></plain_text>
