<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHICS AND UNREPRESENTABILITY IN HEART OF DARKNESS1 ANDREW GIBSON The past two or three decades have seen a decline in confidence in ethical modes of reading fiction. To some extent, at least, it is the rise of theory that has been blamed for this, notably in David Parker's recent book Ethics, Theory and the Novel.2 Parker is surely right to reaffirm the importance of ethical discourses on the novel. But the ethical discourses that are now most significant for the novel are not ones opposed to theory, as Parker would have it, but discourses that have emerged within or engaged with or been produced by theory. To put it differently: it is important that we explore the relevance to fiction of what Zygmunt Bauman has called post-modern ethics3 ? a non-foundational ethics that does not assume knowledge or stable categories prior to praxis, articulation, event ? and the implication of that ethics for our reading. The point would be to return to ethics without returning to an ethical tradition, to reflect on how and how far new ways of thinking ethics might also transform the terms of our thought about reading novels. Of all the unexamined assumptions according to which an older ethical criticism of fiction proceeded, one of the most crucial was the assumption that in fiction, ethics and representation are inseparable. Such an assumption makes it impossible for a novel to 1 I am most grateful to my co-editor for his help with this essay. 2 David Parker, Ethics, Theory and the Novel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994). 3 Zygmunt Bauman, Postmodern Ethics (Oxford: Blackwell, Oxford, 1993).</page><page sequence="2">114 have an ethical dimension outside what is deemed to be its mimetic project. Ethics cannot subsist in a novel other than in relation to characters understood as clearly defined and represented entities. Hence, for example, the dearth, even now, of ethical readings of Beckett's work, where such entities cannot be imagined to exist, where discourse takes precedence over representation, and where the ethics in question would have to be considered, in the first instance, as a discursive ethics. But the point about ethics and representation is not to be confined to a comparatively extreme example like Beckett. It is an issue that can be ? perhaps needs to be ? addressed on a variety of different levels, in a variety of different kinds of text. Heart of Darkness, for instance, is a predominantly representational text that obstinately insists on the limits to representation and insistently dwells on the significance of those limits.4 As far as Conrad's text is concerned, the question seems to me to be this: what is the meaning, in a representational text with obviously ethical concerns, of a kind of faltering or failing of its representational project; and does not that faltering or failing recast the ethical import of the text in question far more radically than we have commonly thought? One of the reasons why Heart of Darkness is so absorbing in this context is that the link in criticism of Conrad's text between ethical questions and questions of representation is a long established one. It goes back as far as Leavis. It is worth recalling the terms of Leavis's argument, not merely because they are germane to my own case, but also because they are helpful as an illustration of an ethical reading of a more classical kind. Leavis, of course, detected two kinds of writing, two modes of discourse in 4 See for example James Guetti, %Heart of Darkness and the Failure of the Imagination', SewaneeReview, 73.3 (1965), pp. 488-504; Peter Brooks, vAn Unreadable Report: Conrad's Heart of Darkness', Reading for the Plot (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1992), pp. 238-63; and Robert Hampson, *Heart of Darkness and "The Speech That Cannot Be Silenced'", English, 39.163 (Spring 1990), pp. 15-32.</page><page sequence="3">115 Heart of Darkness. The first one ? for Leavis, the "strong' kind ? involves an art of "objective correlatives', evoking "a whole wide context of particularities' which convey "values' and "carry specificities of emotion and suggestion'.5 This is what Leavis calls Conrad's "art of vivid essential record' (GT, p. 176). The phrase is interesting: Conrad's is an art that is at one and the same time both "vivid' and "essential'. On the one hand, it is an intensely particular art. On the other hand, it is an art in which " significance' also resides in the presented particulars, in which the "essential', whilst never "separable from the thing rendered', is nevertheless always implicit within it, as qualities like "ordinary greed, stupidity and moral squalor' are translated to us "in terms of things seen and incidents experienced' (GT, id.). This is an art in which characteristics are "embodied' in particulars ? to use a term that Leavis employs with reference to The Shadow-Line (GT, p. 188) ? but where the relationship implied in "embodiment' is somehow mysteriously effaced, as though particularity and essence were one and the same thing; as though the vivid record of life and what Leavis calls the "pattern' of "moral significances' in Heart of Darkness were somehow identical (GT, p. 179). What runs counter to this art, in Heart of Darkness, counter to this v strong discourse', is another discourse that effects an "actual deepening' of the novel. According to Leavis, the consequences of this discourse are "little short of disastrous' (id.). This second discourse involves an " adjectival and worse than superogatory insistence on "unspeakable rites", "unspeakablesecrets", "monstrouspassions", "inconceivable mystery" and so on' (id.). This constitutes what Leavis calls Conrad's " insistence on the presence of what he can't produce', an insistence merely betraying an "absence' or "nullity' (GT, p. 180). In other words, for Leavis, what radically flaws Heart of Darkness and weakens its ethical force is its insistence on the limits to representation and the power of the unrepresentable. 5 F.R. Leavis, The Great Tradition (London: Chatto and Windus, 1948), hereafter Leavis, GT\ p. 174.</page><page sequence="4">116 Leavis's essay on Conrad was first published in 1941,6 yet his conception of what novels are and how they work (or fail to work) is still very much with us today, at least in England, in three respects that are particularly relevant here. Firstly, Leavis assumes that a novel's ethical power is inseparable from a kind of mimetic adequacy (N an art of vivid record'). No ethics is conceivable outside a mimetic project, at least so far as fiction is concerned. Certainty in and of representation is the sine qua non of ethics in narrative, the foundation without which that ethics cannot begin to function. Secondly, the moral power of fiction is inseparable from its certainty as to moral knowledge, the clarity of its moral categories. Of course, it would be absurd to suppose that Leavis was not aware of moral ambiguities in the masterworks of the great tradition. The reverse is often the case: he insists on the degree to which, at its best, the art of Conrad and James is a morally deliberative art that both works in terms of fine and careful moral discriminations and requires such discriminations of its readers. Nonetheless, for Leavis, Conrad knows his ethical terms from the start. He is endowed with a firm, secure, confident consciousness of the moral qualities, is sure of them as they are, unalloyed, beyond any modification or transformation by local context, contingency or history. Conrad knows Agreed', Nstupidity' and vsqualor', for example, as they exist in themselves, in self-sameness, for all people, under all skies. In Conrad's xart of essential record', the categories exist prior to their specific embodiments and their articulation in a specific language. Thirdly, for Leavis, the ethical power of a given novel is inseparable from its fusion of clearly defined category and vividly recorded particular (s an art of vivid essential record'). The particular is numinous, pregnant with a significance that both precedes and will outlast it and is not for an instant to be confused merely with the conventions of the language in which it is articulated. 6 N Revaluations: Joseph Conrad', Scrutiny, 10.1 (1941), pp. 22-50; 10.2 (1942), pp. 157-81.</page><page sequence="5">777 In other words, for Leavis, the ethical power of great fiction is inseparable from ontology on the one hand and cognition on the other: from a knowledge of essences, including the essence of the thing as it is known and rendered through language. But Heart of Darkness can be read in the reverse direction. Its ethical force is arguably located precisely in what it does not or cannot say, or breaks off from saying.7 To read it thus is to assimilate it to a strain in contemporary ethics that derives from Levinas's work and questions any automatic or unreflective valuation of cognitive and ontological assumptions in ethical thought.8 For Levinas, of course, ethics cannot be constructed on a foundation of essences. Indeed, ethics is not a question of cognition. The ethical relation ? for Levinas, the first relation ? takes place in an immediate realm where the relation to or encounter with the other is antecedent to all knowledge, and brings with it the burden of responsibility to the other. To proceed towards the other on the basis of what is deemed to be prior knowledge is at once to have neutralized the alterity, the complexity, the freedom of the other; to have reduced the other to the order of the same. vIn the word "comprehension"', writes Levinas, vwe understand the fact of taking [prendre] and of comprehending [comprendre], that is, the fact of englobing, of appropriating' (77, p. 70). To comprehend is to produce the other as totality. Certainly, vmen can be synthesized', as Levinas says. vMen can easily be treated as objects' (77, p. 170). But to approach 7 Note David Thorburn's response to Leavis in Conrad's Romanticism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), hereafter Thorburn; though Thorburn can no more resist the assumption of essences than Leavis: "Marlow's characteristic diction, his persistent reliance on what might be called a vocabulary of uncertainty, is intimately related to [his] confessions of limitation and bafflement...the famous adjectival insistence which has so disturbed Leavis and others is for the most part an essential aspect of the novel' s meaning' (pp. 117-118). 8 My main point of reference, here, will be Levinas's earlier work, chiefly Totality and Infinity, tr. Alphonso Lingis (Martinus Nijhoff: The Hague, 1961), hereafter Levinas, TI.</page><page sequence="6">118 the other by way of objective cognition and its totalizations is not to institute but rather to deny all ethical relation to the other. That denial emerges as what ? significantly for Heart of Darkness ? Levinas calls vontological imperialism' (77, p. 44). In Levinas's terms, this latter is the expression of the naive, arbitrary, spontaneous dogmatism of the self which directs the understanding at its thitherto obscure object as a clarifying vray of light' (id.), delivers being out of secrecy ? out of its heart of darkness ? and, in so doing, neutralizes the other as it encompasses him or her. This, says Levinas, is vthe very movement of representation and of its evidence'.9 Representation, totalization, ontology are all manifestations of and exercises in what Levinas calls freedom. Freedom is to be identified with what Spinoza famously called the conatus essendi, the Nright to existence' which Spinoza defined as the engine of all intellection. Levinas, however, has described his whole work as directed against that principle and what he takes to be its Hellenic endorsement as the latter is still prevalent today. For the principle of freedom or the conatus essendi is an egology and a principle of violence. According to the Levinas of the essay vThe Ruin of Representation', it is so precisely in representation itself.10 For representation takes as its premise a correspondence or adequation between thought and being, and thereby endorses the illusion of the sovereign and creative intellect. Cognition and representation, then, are both an exertion of violence, what Levinas calls negation, a denial of the independence of existents. vThe absolutely foreign alone can instruct us', he writes (77, p. 73). Thus a significant ethics can have nothing to do with any transcendental sanction, any abstract principles or rules. 9 By contrast, the process of mapping implicit in Marlow's narrative in Heart of Darkness replaces a blank with a darkness. See Christopher L. Miller, Blank Darkness: Africanist Discourse in French (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1985). 10 See Levinas, NLa Ruine de la Representation1, in En Decouvrant VExistence avec Husserl et Heidegger (Paris: J. Vrin, 1987), pp. 125-36.</page><page sequence="7">119 For such principles or rules will always have set terms for the encounter with the other in advance; they will always insist on our thinking and knowing beforehand. For Levinas, ethics is different from thought or knowledge. And not only that. It cuts right across ontology. It is radically and irreducibly other than all thought of essence. The ethical relation is the encounter with the other. Ethics intrudes in this relation precisely in the alterity of the other, an alterity which forever exceeds all knowledge I can have of her or him. An ethical priority emerges, not as my knowledge dominates the other, but as the moral height of the other dominates me and all the terms ? being, essence, identity, principle, the same ? in which I would seek to encompass her or him. The other overflows all ideas I can have of the other, and the consequence is shame; shame at the sheer contingency, the radical smallness of the ideas in which I would seek to encompass the other; shame at the stark exposure of the conatus essendi, the self-will that proposes those ideas as valid and important. What shames me, above all, says Levinas, is infinity as revealed in the other. Levinas understands this infinity, in the Cartesian sense, as always overflowing the thought that thinks it. The ethical relation, then, is a relation to infinity rather than the thought of totality. It is a question of "metaphysics', in the terms particular to Levinas, rather than vontology'. Because it is infinity that I encounter with and in the other as I cannot encounter it in myself, it is always the other who commands me. I am always responsible to the other. The ethical relation, finally, begins precisely as the other in its infinity exceeds my representation of it. It begins precisely in the faltering or failing or, as Levinas has it, "the ruin of representation'. Such an account of ethics has large implications for both the ethics of reading and the ethics of fiction.11 At the very least, it enjoins us to grow more thoughtful about the ways in which novels 11 For an excellent account of some of these implications, see Robert Eaglestone, Ethical Criticism: Reading After Levinas (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997).</page><page sequence="8">120 themselves address questions of representation and the limits of representation. There is arguably more at stake, here, than is commonly recognized in all the various and prolific, post-modern discussions of self-reflexivity, anti-realism, the writerly versus the readerly and so on. In the context of Levinas's thought, the issues in question take on an ethical dimension. This seems to me to be precisely the case with discussions of representation in Heart of Darkness. In one of its aspects, the novella is pervaded by two discourses. We might partly think of them, respectively, as Kurtzian and Marlovian discourse. But they are not to be identified with single characters. Indeed, to identify them thus would precisely be to begin to construct the ethics of Conrad's text around two persons understood as essences or homogenous entities. In Levinas's terms, Kurtzian discourse is ontological. Kurtz is persistently associated with the word "all' and the concept of the whole: You should have heard him say, 'My ivory.' Oh yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my ?' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to him.... (HD, p. 116) Kurtz's urge is precisely towards the domination of the whole: "By the simple exercise of our will', he writes, "we can exert a power for good practically unbounded' (HD, p. 118). If everything supposedly belongs to Kurtz then, of course, Marlow also informs us that "All Europe contributed' to his "making' (HD, p. 117). If Kurtz's drive is towards total possession, he also serves as a kind of total summation. In all its various implications and with all their various nuances, the meaning of Kurtz's story cannot be separated from the will to totalize, to think the whole that characterizes him throughout. Whichever aspect of his trajectory one chooses to emphasize, the totalizing impulse is intrinsic to it. Indeed, that impulse underlies all the various ethical inflections to Kurtz's career and is the very crux of the moral predicament that he both endures</page><page sequence="9">121 and embodies. In this respect, like Levinas, Conrad surely suggests that the ethical issues with which he is chiefly concerned are inseparable from the limits of a particular and culturally specific epistemology. For both Levinas the philosopher and Conrad the novelist, ethical questions are bound up with questions of how one knows, the terms in which one knows and in which one chooses to express one's knowledge. Thus in the phrase "Exterminate all the brutes!' (HD, p. 118), we should underline the relatively inconspicuous second word. If it gives the idea of "extermination' full weight and makes its meaning wholly explicit, the word also emphasizes a totalizing habit of thought and perception without which the idea of extermination itself is impossible. What hangs over Kurtz's deadly sentence is partly a question about the very reflexes that lead us to think peoples or races ? for instance ? as wholes. In fact, the word "all' is sufficiently momentous, here, for it to echo on afterwards in Marlow's subsequent discourse ("he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum'; "I had full information about all these things', etc.). Kurtz's last words equally function as the statement of a grim totality: "wide enough to embrace the whole universe', says Mariow, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness. He had summed up ? he had judged' (HD, p. 151). The ironic tone to the passage strikes as much at the very fact of summary judgment ? that queer native custom ? as it does at the nature of the judgment passed. It is of course an irony to which a whole tradition ? supremely, perhaps, an English tradition as exemplified in Leavis ? is not immune. Once again, too, Marlow insistently and repetitively emphasizes how far the Kurtzian predicament and the sombreness of Kurtz's closing moods are inseparable from the habit of thinking totality: The horror!'.... After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth ? the strange</page><page sequence="10">122 commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own extremity I remember best ? a vision of grayness without form filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things ? even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I have been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps! (HD, p. 151, italics mine). The "wisdom' with whose conviction Mariow ironically toys, here, is of a piece with the "knowledge of unexplored regions' with which Kurtz is also associated (HD, p. 153). Its totalizing aspiration ? its overbearing grandiosity ? finds an appropriate vehicle in grandiloquence. Crucially ? perhaps even in the first instance ? Kurtz's will to mastery manifests itself as a will to dominate through language, through a totalizing discourse. For Levinas, the corruptions of ontology are precisely and pointedly evident in rhetoric. Rhetoric is unscrupulous, calculating, a function of the intelligence that has designs upon and seeks to subdue others. The rhetorician takes "the position of him who approaches his neighbour with ruse': Rhetoric, absent from no discourse, and which philosophical discourse seeks to overcome, resists discourse.... It approaches the other not to face him, but obliquely ? not, to be sure, as a thing, since rhetoric remains conversation, and across all its artifices goes unto the Other, solicits his yes. But the specific nature of rhetoric (of propaganda, flattery, diplomacy, etc.) consists in corrupting this freedom. It is for this that it is preeminently violence, that is, injustice ? not violence exercised on an inertia (which would not be a violence), but on a freedom, which, precisely as freedom, should be incorruptible. (TI, p. 70) Rhetoric closes off all possibility of dialogue with the other in her or his irreducible alterity. Rhetoric is the violence which refuses to listen, refuses exchange, assimilation, hybridization, self-reflexivity.</page><page sequence="11">123 By contrast, on the one hand, conversation maintains the ethical relation with the other, with the possibility always of unsaying what is said; and, on the other hand, philosophical discourse seeks to avoid violence in turning away from rhetoric as discursive mode. In Levinas's sense, Kurtz is no philosopher. He is rather a discourser: I made the strange discovery that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn't say to myself, 'Now I will never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by the hand,' but, 'now I will never hear him.' The man presented himself as a voice.... The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words.... (HD, p. 113) Kurtz may be the author of "splendid monologues' on "love, justice, conduct of life' (HD, p. 132), but his famed "magnificent eloquence' (HD, p. 131) is precisely a rhetoric that permits no encounter with the other. "You don't talk with that man ? you listen to him', says the Russian harlequin (HD, p. 123). Coppola catches this very finely in Apocalypse Now in having Brando's head isolated in darkness as he talks to Sheen, as though he were one of Dante's damned. Humanistic at first, Kurtz's rhetoric can speedily reverse into the opposite of humanism. Humanism and nihilism appear as twin sides of the same coin, at least insofar as both are inextricable from a rhetoric that speaks totalities. Indeed, in Kurtz, the totalizing rhetoric is a figure for an egology finally revealing itself as insane catastophe. " "My ivory"', says Marlow, mournfully. " "My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my....'" It is thus that "everything belong[s]' to Kurtz (HD, p. 116). At the same time, there is a point to be made about the double set of quotation marks as I have just used them. I shall return to it very shortly. In Heart of Darkness, then, the Kurtzian principle is one of grandiose and summary representation which seeks to encompass and articulate the whole. As such, it is by no means confined to</page><page sequence="12">124 Kurtz. Indeed, there is a sense in which "everything' might be thought of as "belonging' to almost any given (European) character in the tale. For the kind of totalizing discourse most obviously associated with Kurtz is one from which no European character is free: the chief accountant, the brickmaker, the general manager, the Russian harlequin ? each of them is disposed to discoursing on the whole. "Transgression ? punishment ? bang!' says Marlow's papier-mache Mephistopheles, with reference to the "beaten nigger': "Pitiless, pitiless. That's the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations for the future' (HD, p. 80). Kurtz's final call for extermination may redound more ironically than this, but otherwise the distinction between the sentences is only one of degree. In the case of the Russian harlequin, of course, it is actually Kurtz himself who occupies the place of the desired totality: " It was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz', muses Mariow. " The man filled his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions' (HD, p. 128). As Marlow himself notes, the totalizing habit, here, is that of the idolater.12 Much more pressingly and significantly, however, it is the habit of the emperors of the earth, who "are accustomed to look upon' it in "the shackled form of a conquered monster' (HD, p. 96). In a sense, Heart of Darkness takes as its principal theme the Heideggerian nightmare, the impending triumph of Western metaphysics as it is ensured by and properly indistinguishable from the triumph of Western power. It is thus appropriate that all the European characters in the story should be representative of or instrumental to the spread of Empire whilst also doggedly articulating or reproducing an ontological discourse that insists on the priority of existence over existents, in Levinas's 12 For a discussion of the significance of idolatry in Heart of Darkness - and of the relationship between ideas and idolatry in Conrad's novella - see Patrick Brantlinger, Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism 1830-1914 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988).</page><page sequence="13">125 terms, of the Idea over embodiment, enactment, materiality.13 Everywhere, it is ontology that provides the justification imperialism seeks, that serves as the latterfs torch and sacred fire. It is evident enough in a conviction as to the principles of justice, for example, which is not only broached by the brickmaker, but runs through the tale like a refrain. Here Marlow's wonderful, wicked, brief, parodic sketch of the Scottish sailmaker stands as comment on the European enterprise itself: I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about 'walking on all fours.' If you as much as smiled, he would ? though a man of sixty ? offer to fight you. (HD, pp. 81-82) The vignette functions as a kind of comic reductio ad absurdum of the sort of certitude repeatedly evident in the Europeans in the story, a certitude that, in ethical terms, is profoundly disabling. In Heart of Darkness, no-one escapes ontology. Kurtz's "cousin', who calls on Mariow at the end, is an obvious enough example, with his assertion that Kurtz was a Universal genius' (HD, p. 154). But ontology is by no means the preserve of the less appealing characters. Indeed, part of the subtlety of Conrad's achievement arguably has to do with his recognition that, if ontology and the thought of totality spread everywhere, they do so at the expense of the more familiar moral distinctions ? between liberal enlightenment and benighted reaction, for instance ? that some might otherwise seek to sustain. Thus the first narrator, for instance, is a conspicuous example of the ontological principle, awaiting illumination, as he does, the key to Marlow's narrative: 13 For an important account of the relevance of an emphasis on materiality to an ethics of alterity, see Thomas Docherty, Alterities: Criticism, History, Representation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995).</page><page sequence="14">726 The others might have been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river. (iZD, p. 83) If there is a "clue' to the "uneasiness' in question, of course, it is perhaps inseparable from the hunger for an answer that so desires such clues. Above all, Mariow himself is by no means offered to us as having somehow moved beyond ontology. We should bear in mind the fact that, in the first narrator's terms, he is not only a "wanderer' but also a "seaman': ...most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them ? the ship; and so is their country ? the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself.... For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. (HD, p. 48) The passage from which this quotation comes is usually read in terms of its final assertion of Marlow's distinctive difference.14 But it is surely the case that what these lines offer us is a crude and extreme version of what are nonetheless features of Marlow himself. Part of his mind does indeed have the " stay-at-home order' of the seaman's ? the order of ontology, in which home is always with one and sameness prevails over difference. In particular, the oracular, generalizing Marlow is unable to escape the totalizing 14 See for example Cedric Watts, Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness': A Critical and Contextual Study (Milan: Mursia International, 1977), pp. 41-42.</page><page sequence="15">127 principle, the assumption of the one truth, the conviction of universals and essences. This is strikingly evident, of course, in his view of women: It's queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own, and there had never been anything like it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over. (HD, p. 59) The voice, here, is surely that of Mariow the seaman and not Marlow the wanderer, a Marlow for whom, indeed, va casual stroll' on shore v suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent'. Hence the tone of unreflective superiority to feminine self-deception.15 Marlow's problem is in large measure his implicit faith in a singular knowledge. Its necessary consequence is the assumption that others are excluded from the possession of such knowledge. For this Marlow, essences always proceed singularities. This Marlow enters a lady's room and finds that it looked vjust as you would expect a lady's drawing-room to look' (/ZD, p. 59). For him, realities lie deeper than appearances. v Belief must be opposed to v acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags ? rags that would fly off at the first good shake' (HD, p. 97). There are vessentials...under the surface' (HD, p. 100). This Marlow insistently returns to the conviction that there is a v truth of things', even if he may feel kept away from it (HD, p. 61). In bluff, virile terms, he asserts that one must "meet that truth with his own true stuff (HD, p. 97). This Marlow knows about Geist in that he knows what an v absolutely pure' spirit might be (HD, p. 126). Hence the fact that he can 15 Ruth Nadelhaft has suggested that Marlow disparages women because he finds it difficult to be indebted to them. See Joseph Conrad (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991), p. 49. Nadelhaft suggests that, as men "cling to the "idea" in the face of the "facts'" (p. 45), so Marlow substitutes anxious idealization for "the humanity of any woman' (p. 49).</page><page sequence="16">128 conceive of Kurtz as having N filled' the life of the Russian harlequin (HD, p. 128). It is therefore not surprising to find Marlow suggesting that, if the colonial enterprise is to be redeemed, it will be only by the videa at the back of if (HD, p. 51, italics mine). The predicament of this Marlow is partly a matter of the limited ? not to say banal ? range of his spatial metaphors for knowledge. But then, part at least of the originality of Heart of Darkness has to do precisely with the connection it repeatedly establishes between, on the one hand, the mentality that sees truth in terms of what is vwithin' or Ninside', as 'hidden' (HD, p. 93) or buried, and its discovery as an unearthing or penetration (HD, p. 95); and, on the other, the drive Nto tear treasure out of the bowels of the land' (HD, p. 87). Marlow, then, is himself much given to thinking the totality. Indeed, it is one of the story's most significant ironies that we cannot be certain how far the totalizing principle as exemplified in Kurtz is not in fact a projection of Marlow's own drive to totalization. It is Marlow, after all, who is responsible for conveying the Kurtzian principle to us, in what is at times a grandiloquent rhetoric that is hardly distinguishable from Kurtz's own. In part, Marlow's rhetoric might actually be imagined as a translation of Kurtz's, revised and improved. Equally, it is Marlow who is the allegorist; Marlow who tells us, for example, that all Europe went into Kurtz's making; Marlow who ultimately suggests that Kurtz's stare N was wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness' (HD, p. 151). Hence my point, earlier, about the double quotation marks. Everything that Kurtz says in the story is in double quotation marks. It is speech incorporated into Marlow's speech. In a sense, Kurtz is absorbed into Marlow's very substance, is even the corruptive principle within that substance; except, of course, that there is an aporia as to the v origin' of the tale. Kurtz is both the pretext for and in that sense the origin of Marlow's story, and yet also its product. It is even possible to read Heart of Darkness as psychomachia, with Marlow engaged in a struggle with the Kurtz</page><page sequence="17">129 present both in himself and in his narrative. Marlow, then, is deeply complicit with Kurtzian discourse, with ontology. As he ruefully admits at one point in his story, T also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings' (HD, p. 65). There is a profound double irony to his respect for the chief accountant (HD9 p. 68), the N apple-pie order' of whose books is surely bound to remind us of the v stay-at-home order' of the seaman's mind (HD, p. 68). It is precisely here that the other discourse in Heart of Darkness ? the one that Leavis found so 'disastrous' ? becomes important. Leavis saw this discourse as having the v strained impressiveness' of a rhetoric that seeks to generate a vague sense of vprofound and tremendous significance' (GT, p. 180). But the stress for example on v implacable force' and v inscrutable intention' (HD, p. 93) in the tale is surely part of something larger that runs insistently through Marlow's discourse both as narrator and as character. Indeed, it also runs through the discourse of the first narrator: in that sense, like Kurtzian discourse, it is finally impersonal, not individuated, not to be reduced to a particular subjectivity. What pervades Marlovian discourse is a sense of epistemological dead-end, of determinate limits to knowledge and representation, the irreducibly complex mystery of the world as it is encountered by the cognitive intellect.16 In this discourse, representation itself is constantly threatened by the vunfathomable enigma' (HD, p. 105) whose mention so dismays Leavis. In Levinas's terms, this is a discourse that starts from the principle of infinity, as opposed to totalizing discourse. It is the discourse of a Marlow well-known for his accounts ofv inconclusive experiences' (HD, p. 51). This Marlow is worried by the v incomprehensible' (HD, p. 62). Of course, what most obviously balks understanding, in Marlow's case, is Africa, v the silence of the land.. .its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed 16 Cf Thorburn: ...as Kurtz's eloquence and Marlow's tormented narrative indicate, art itself and even the grounds of Western epistemology are challenged by the darkness' (p. 124).</page><page sequence="18">130 life' (/ZD, p. 80). But equally, once recognized for what it is, the fact of ineluctable mystery radiates everywhere. If Africa is irreducible to European terms then, equally, Europe must be imagined as a source of perplexity to Africa, van insoluble mystery from the sea' (/ZD, p. 64). So, too, Europeans are puzzles to each other. vThey can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means' (/ZD, p. 85). The Russian harlequin, for instance, is imagined as N improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering', like the jungle (/ZD, p. 126). Indeed, the image of the vast tangle of the jungle might partly be thought of as Conrad's metaphorical reproof to all epistemological assurance: The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence. (/ZD, p. 86) But then, in Marlow's terms, the amazed encounter with alterity ? an alterity that will subsequently be subdued ? lies at the very root of the European experience. His imaginary commander of a Roman legion in Britain, for example, is pictured as tormented by living vin the midst of the incomprehensible' (/ZD, p. 50). It is precisely the recognition of the encounter with alterity that baffles all representation, making its impossible', for instance, vto convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence': It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream ? making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams.... (/ZD, p. 82) Indeed, the encounter with alterity seems to ask for full expression in terms that go beyond anthropomorphism, into the further reaches of time and space: N prehistoric earth' on the one hand; on the other,</page><page sequence="19">131 the vunknown planet' (HD, p. 95). The Marlow who finds those terms, of course, is most certainly one of the v wanderers' (id.), not at all the man who positions himself as the sane onlooker v secretly appalled...before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse' (HD, p. 96). Yet, as we have seen, there is an ample measure of the seaman's as there is of the wanderer's disposition in Marlow, and this mixture is also there in Heart of Darkness itself. My point is not that what I have called Marlovian discourse somehow Novercomes' or Nresists' or neutralizes the ontological discourse in Conrad's tale. Rather, it gnaws away at it, like an unease that cannot be stilled. It provides an insistent reminder that ontology itself has a history, that ontology is itself a discursive construction. In this respect, Marlovian discourse deconstructs Kurtzian discourse, in what I take to be the better sense of deconstruction: it does not destroy ontology; it leaves ontology standing, but as a hollow shell. It indicates the finitude of ontological discourse, its lack of purchase on the real. This is partly the consequence of the modes of ironic play which Marlow adopts during the course of his narration. In Heart of Darkness, Marlovian discourse might be said to open up an ethical space in which alterity is registered precisely as it persistently and forever exceeds cognition and indicates the limits of ontology. But this is by no means simply a question of a Conradian ethics of discourse. On another level, that ethics is also v dramatized', not least in the conclusion of the novel, the encounter with the Intended. It is interesting to note what happens to Marlow before that encounter takes place. Under Kurtz's spell, in Levinasian terms, he comes close to rejecting infinity for totality. The vtotalizing vision' in question, of course, is Kurtz's at the end of his life. It is the vision of Kurtz the despairer, not the colonialist or bringer of enlightenment. But it is none the less imposing for that. Marlow believes, after all, that he has seen vthe appalling face of a glimpsed truth' (HD, p. 151), and the proleptic significance of the metaphor</page><page sequence="20">132 will shortly be apparent. The v truth' in question, of course, is that of the N impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around' (HD, p. 150.). Part of Marlow's problem is his aptitude for double voicing as indicated by those double quotation marks. For if the advantage conferred by such an aptitude is a disposition to irony, the disadvantage is a propensity for being submerged or absorbed: ...it is not my own extremity I remember best ? a vision of grayness without form filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things ? even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to have lived through. (HD, p. 151) Hence his conviction that all wisdom Nand all truth, and all sincerity' may after all have been Ncompressed' into Kurtz's summary judgment (id.). Indeed, Marlow's more nightmarish version of this is his image of Kurtz on his stretcher, v opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind' (HD, p. 155, italics mine). This Marlow ? now back in Europe ? is no longer a baffled intelligence on the threshold of the wilderness. He is rather caught up once more in a European agonistics of knowledge, in a conflict with all those v intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew' (HD, p. 152). For Levinas, of course, the ethical relation is not abstract but personal. It is first and foremost an encounter with a face. The Nsituation where totality breaks up', writes Levinas, is precisely Nthe gleam of exteriority or of transcendence in the face of the Other' (77, p. 24). The face is va living presence', expression (77, p. 66). As such, in its mobility and multiplicity, it escapes any vform' to which I might seek to reduce it or its possessor. It cannot be vcontained...comprehended, that is, encompassed' (77, p. 194):</page><page sequence="21">133 The face of the Other at each moment destroys and overflows the plastic image it leaves me, the idea existing to my own measure and to the measure of its ideatum ? the adequate idea. (77, pp. 50-51) Thus the principle of irreducibility ? of infinity itself ? is experienced in the face of the Other and its unmasterable vforeignness' (77, p. 194). The 'epiphany of the face' involves an experience of its 'nakedness' or destitution as supplication or demand (77, p. 75). The face asks for a response of me. It engages me in responsibility, because it requires that I give. It commands me from an absolute height, in Levinas's phrase, and its 'mastery' of me (id.) is inseparable from the fact that, in principle, I cannot master it. Thus ...the presence before a face, my orientation toward the Other, can lose the avidity proper to the gaze only by turning into generosity, incapable of approaching the other with empty hands. (77, p. 50) The 'generosity' in question manifests itself in the first instance as communication: in Levinas's terms, in language. As an 'exchange of ideas about the world', language actually presupposes 'the originality of the face' (77, p. 202). Language breaks out of us in response to the other and his or her destitution. As Blanchot describes it, the Levinasian imperative insists that ' I will not speak of the other or about the other but I will speak.. .to the other'.17 For the primary feature of language is 'the interpellation, the vocative': The other is maintained and confirmed in his heterogeneity as soon as one calls upon him, be it only to say to him that one cannot speak to him, to classify him as sick, to announce to him his death sentence; at the same time as grasped, wounded, outraged, he is 'respected.' The invoked is not what I comprehend: he is not under a category. (77, p. 69) 17 Maurice Blanchot, Our Clandestine Companion', in Richard A. Cohen (ed.), Face to Face with Levinas (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986), pp. 41-50, p. 45.</page><page sequence="22">134 Thus the encounter with the face and through language has an absolute ethical priority over cognition and representation, over any impulse to know the other. For to speak in response to the other is always, in the first instance, to refuse to reduce him to terms, to greet him or her in his or her alterity. The crucial point about Marlow's final encounter with the Intended seems to me to be that, in what Levinas calls the face to face, Marlow turns aside from the notional priority of vthe things I knew'. He abandons his own conclusive truth, the truth he has represented and produced in his own narrative, the truth to which his narrative has led. He does this in the service of a higher claim: the immediate demand of the other. Throughout the tale, Marlow has repeatedly been aware of the demand or supplication of the face, notably in the case of the "moribund shape' beneath the tree: .. .1 saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly. (HD, p. 66) But he also repeatedly withdraws from the face into thinking what Levinas calls the category. (sThe man seemed young ? almost a boy ? but you know with them it's hard to tell', HD, p.67). If, from the start, for Marlow, the Intended appears as an unreal figure or vShade' (HD, p. 160), it is precisely because she comes to him as a face of whose appeal he is immediately and agonizingly aware: She came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards me in the dusk.... This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. (HD, p. 157) The destitution or v awful desolation' (id.) of the face of the Intended is something of which Marlow is at once aware, and to which he cannot but respond. (VI saw her and him in the same instant of time ? his death and her sorrow ? I saw her sorrow in</page><page sequence="23">135 the very moment of his death', id.). Equally, vthe appealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my lips' (HD, p. 158) repeatedly summons Marlow into speech. But, more remarkably, it compels him into an acknowledgment of the absolute priority of the other. For he now not only repeatedly responds to the need of the face, but surrenders his own knowledge and truth to it. As the ethical demand persists, so the clarities of enlightenment begin to fade: 'You knew him best,' I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every word spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white, remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief and love, (JfD, p. 158) The significance of the final lie thus becomes evident: it is in no respect a defeat for Marlow, but a triumph. For it involves a final abandonment of truth and the category in the service of the ethical demand. It gives priority to the face and the need to respond to the face. Marlow gives up his knowledge in favour of the other's need. In doing so, he resorts to a very different conception of justice to the patriarchal one that has hitherto dominated the novel and is exemplified in the brickmaker: It seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens do not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn't. (HD, p. 162) Various editors point out that Marlow is here recalling the Latin maxim, ^Fiat justitia, mat coelum' ,18 The implication of the end of the story is something like the reverse of that maxim: it is when such a conception of justice is abandoned that ethics ? like 18 See, for example, Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness, ed. Robert Hampson (Penguin, 1995), p. 139.</page><page sequence="24">136 Marlow's v infinite pity' (HDy p. 161) ? is made possible. But finally, how adequate a response is Heart of Darkness in such a reading to the questions ? of race, gender and the colonial enterprise ? that it raises today? Achebe has insisted that what should be the vreal question1 in Conrad's story ? vthe dehumanization of Africa and Africans' as the result of an Nage long' European attitude ? never really gets mooted at all.19 Is an account of Heart of Darkness which reads its self-deconstructive impetus in ethical terms an adequate rejoinder to Achebe's argument? Undoubtedly not. But perhaps Achebe's case should not exactly be N answered'. There is conceivably a certain implausibility, an element of wishful thinking, to attempts to turn Conrad into a post-modern liberal ? or any kind of contemporary liberal ? avant la lettre, at least, in Heart of Darkness. But, however compelling Achebe's account of Conrad's complicities in certain respects, it has at least one feature in common with liberal and equally with conservative accounts of Heart of Darkness: it assumes that, in principle, the story speaks of and addresses a whole, claims the attention of a whole readership. Yet Conrad himself puts such totalizing discourse radically into question. Even if it is indeed the case that the story had nothing much of positive value to say to blacks (or women) ? even if its significance is a matter of particular historical and cultural proportions ? that significance is not negligible. Contemporary thought has repeatedly suggested that the cruelties and injustices of imperialism and patriarchy, and the miseries that have been their consequence, may finally be inseparable from Western ontology, from a habit of thought that deems it possible and necessary to speak of and therefore master the other as whole, to reduce the other to the terms of the same. In Heart of Darkness, in playing Kurtzian discourse off against Marlovian discourse, Conrad plays totality off against infinity, the thought of being and the representation of being against the thought 19 Chinua Achebe, vAn Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness', pp. 251-62, p. 257.</page><page sequence="25">137 of an alterity that overflows all ideas and representations of being. In that respect, he begins to deconstruct a discourse upon which imperialism depends for its conviction and survival, the N idea at the back' of the v conquest of the earth1 (HD, pp. 50-51). It is precisely in that practice that I would want to locate the more significant ethics in Heart of Darkness. It may be that thus, like others more or less contemporary with him (Nietzsche and Freud, for example) and with similar resistances and complicities, Conrad begins the long job of winding white, European, masculine culture towards the end of its power, in a manner from which modern, white European males have chiefly to learn.</page></plain_text>
