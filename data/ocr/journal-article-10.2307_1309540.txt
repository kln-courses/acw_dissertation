<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN BIRDS... Current Ornithology, vol. 1. Richard F. Johnston, ed. Plenum Press, New York, 1983. 402 pp. $39.50 (cloth). A 1976 national workshop sponsored by the American Ornithologists' Union and the National Science Foundation on the future of American ornithology con- cluded that review volumes should be published regularly in this field. This charge was finally realized in 1983 with this first volume of Current Ornithology. The first chapter, "Comparative Avi- an Demography" by Robert Ricklefs, is a theoretical and conjectural review with a narrow series of construct models. Apparently, for this and other chapters, production schedules limited reference citations to those published in 1980 or before; in this and other fast-moving subdisciplines of ornithology, such time lags can be frustrating. Chapter 2, the "Determination of Clutch Size in Precocial Birds" by D. Winkler and J. Walters, solidly summa- rizes breeding biology in precocial birds (51 families), with intriguing discussions of the various explanations for clutch size evolution. The complexity of the hypotheses for these "primitive" preco- cial species clearly rival those for altri- cial species. The "Structure and Func- tion of Avian Eggs" (Chapter 3) examines the physiological dimensions of embryo environmental regulation. Here Cynthia Carey argues effectively for active regulatory ability in embryos themselves, in addition to classic exter- nal controls. Larry Martin supports "The Origin of Birds and of Avian Flight" (Chapter 4) from an ancestor related to the crocodil- ian branch of early reptiles; his discus- sion will certainly arouse controversy among some paleontologists. With a literature review from Audu- bon (1897) to the present, Chapter 5, "Great Plains Hybrid Zones" by J. Ris- ing, updates the studies of hybridization in the Midwest within fourteen genera. Rising's evidence of natural selection against the hybrids argues against cur- rent trends for a conservative taxonomy, with the original eastern and western forms retaining species rank. In Chapter 6, "Species Concepts and Speciation Analysis," J. Cracraft clearly challenges some traditional definitions of species and shows how alternative defi- nitions can influence our understanding of avian evolution (e.g., the phylogenetic species concept). In "Bird Chromosomes," G. Shields shows the great need for research on avian genetics. This field suffers from technical difficulties; only a few percent of the world's 8900 bird species have so far been karyotyped. K. Corbin looks at current population genetics in Chapter 8, "Genetic Struc- ture and Avian Systematics." Corbin analyzes genetic distances, character- ized by protein variations, with Wright- ian F statistics to identify generic and interfamilial relationships. The longest chapter, "Phylogeny and Classification of Birds Based on the Data of DNA-DNA Hybridization" by Charles Sibley and John Ahlquist, con- tinues with taxonomy based on genetic material. Their exhaustive review con- cludes that many moder avian phyloge- nies have been "misinterpreted and mis- understood to an astonishing degree." Again, this chapter will not be without its critics. J. R. Hinchliffe and M. Gumpel-Pinot provide details on the "Experimental Analysis of Avian Limb Morphogen- esis" in Chapter 10, including advances made possible by scanning electron micrographs. In Chapter 11, "Variation in Mate Fidelity in Monogamous Birds," N. Ford looks at the ethology/ecology of mating systems in a diversity of birds. Particularly striking is the frequency of polygyny reported in 61 species of North American passerines. In "The Evolution of Differential Bird Migration" (Chapter 12), E. Ketterson and Val Nolan Jr. discuss modern migra- ... AND HOW THEY LIVE Avian Ecology. C. M. Perrins and T. R. Birkhead. Blackie, Glasgow and Chap- man &amp; Hall, New York, 1983. 221 pp., illus. $42.00 (cloth), $19.95 (paper). Avian Ecology, one of 35 volumes in the tertiary level biology series produced by Blackie, is intended for advanced undergraduates and serious amateurs wishing to know more about the ecology of birds. It aims to fill the niche between popular bird books and texts for profes- sional ornithologists. As an introduction to avian ecology for nonprofessionals it is extremely successful, and it will also help beginning students serious about studying birds. The book is divided into nine chapters that include the following topics: terri- tion hypotheses in detail, including tests from their data on junco (Junco hyema- lis) movements. Again, many unresolved difficulties appear, but the direction of future research is indicated. The book concludes with a thorough author index for references cited throughout the text, an exhaustive bird name index, and a conventional subject index. I found Current Ornithology stimulat- ing and generally well written. The pro- duction quality is high, as is the price. Most of the chapters have a limited scope, emphasizing the authors' own re- search, and a large proportion (about half) of the chapters deal with avian genetics, DNA, and hybridization. More general review articles would have been better for teaching (e.g., for an advanced ornithology course). If the Plenum series becomes successfully established as an annual or biennial review, its format will undoubtedly evolve; the publishers must aim for annual publication if the series is to be a useful current one. It is a minor distraction that the A.O.U. Centennial review volume, Perspectives in Ornithol- ogy, appeared at the same time as Cur- rent Ornithology with some unfortunate replication (e.g., both have an "origin of birds" chapter by L. Martin). Overall, however, I welcome this new ornitholog- ical contribution. CHARLES F. LECK Department of Biological Sciences Rutgers University New Brunswick, NJ 08903 toriality and coloniality, breeding sys- tems, breeding seasons, clutch size, life cycles and population studies, bird com- munities, foraging behavior, and migra- tion. Each chapter begins with an intro- duction to the main issues and concludes with a summary of the major theories, observations, and ideas presented in the preceding pages. The book also contains several easy-to-understand figures and tables enabling the reader to clearly fol- low the text as well as the main theoreti- cal framework for each chapter. Al- though some figure captions could have been better, their overall quality was high. The book's theme is the adaptive sig- nificance of bird ecology and behavior, and the evolutionary approach is evident throughout. Another theme is optimality theory; most topics are considered in light of the theory's predictions and tests BioScience Vol. 34 No. 10 652</page><page sequence="2">of these predictions. Using this theory as a framework is particularly helpful in discussions of sociality, reproduction, and foraging behavior. The many dia- grams showing costs and benefits of par- ticular behaviorial or ecological prob- lems make the text even more understandable. In general, definitions of terms are adequate, although I take exception to the authors' defining ecology as "evolu- tion in action"; for the truly beginning student, this definition would hardly be adequate. There is a good discussion, however, of how ecologists often use anthropomorphic terms (e.g., "breeding strategies") as a type of shorthand for more complex evolutionary concepts. The authors necessarily had to make some choices of both topics to be dis- cussed and ideas presented under each topic. Topics omitted that I would have liked to see include: behavior during the nonbreeding season (not just migration), mate selection, parent-young interac- tions, and habitat (including nest site) selection. Similarly, there are subjects that might have been discussed within the broad topics covered that were not, specifically: age effects (under mating strategies and foraging), importance of critical resources such as nutrients (un- der foraging), and display sites (under territory). Nonetheless, for a text aimed at a general audience, this book is ade- quate and even presents an exciting pic- ture of the field. For nonamateurs the book presents a few problems, however. For example, although it is difficult to imagine what an advanced undergraduate really knows about avian ecology, I found some of the descriptions and discussions oversimpli- fied, possibly giving the student the im- pression that ecological phenomena are PRIMATOLOGY AT CAMBRIDGE Primate Social Relationships: An Inte- grated Approach. Robert A. Hinde. Sin- auer Associates, Sunderland, MA, 1983. 384 pp., illus. $40.00 (cloth), $21.00 (paper). Probably no one has done more to further our knowledge of primate behav- ior-through his own research and the training and nuturing of students-than Robert Hinde. This book is a showcase for much of that work with students and close associates at Cambridge. If primatologists are to grapple with clear-cut and easy to study. Territoriali- ty, for example, is discussed in terms of economic defensibility-the cost and benefit of the system to the individual. Mere cost-benefit analysis may not com- pletely explain territoriality, since some aspects relating to energy constraints are not included in the analysis. Birds may select a territory based on its adequate display sites for attracting mates, avail- able cover for chicks, or optimal nesting density for adequate predator defense. These factors are not necessarily mea- sured by energy constraints. The authors' discussion of the center- edge effect in colonial nesting birds (cen- ter-nesting birds produce more young) also oversimplifies this concept, compli- cated by many other factors including age; many authors have failed to find a center-edge effect at all. Indeed center- edge effects may be entirely due to other factors, resulting only from age, particu- lar predators, or some other aspect of colony structure. Unfortunately, winter territoriality, a case where optimality theory is particularly useful, is not ade- quately discussed. In their discussion of breeding timing, Perrins and Birkhead imply that early nesting birds are more successful, giving examples to support this viewpoint. In fact, however, there are many examples of mid-nesting birds that raise more young and even a few examples of late- nesting pairs being most successful. When birds are most successful depends upon many factors, including weather conditions, food availability, and preda- tors during each breeding season. For the North American reader, the book may contain too many examples from Europe. In many instances it would have been more appropriate to use ex- amples from both the Old and the New key issues and if findings are to generate principles of wider applicability, Hinde argues, then more than additional facts about monkeys and apes is needed. Pri- matologists need a conceptual frame- work, one yielding "an ordered body of knowledge-a science of social behav- ior." For full understanding, contends Hinde, social behavior must be studied at several levels, including individual be- havior, relationships, and social struc- ture, for at each level "emergent proper- ties" not apparent at lower levels may surface. Behavioral explanations should interweave considerations of causation, Worlds. Both authors have more experi- ence with European species, of course, but even the advanced ornithology un- dergraduate student in North America would have little knowledge of these Old World species. And one more minor flaw-I note that there are 14 references by Lack and 5 by Coulson, but only 5 by MacArthur, 1 by Trivers, and none by Niko Tinbergen. Surely avian ecology has been greatly influenced by Niko Tin- bergen, who published some of the first and classical studies on territoriality, co- loniality, and antipredator behavior. Nonetheless, these authors are to be commended for producing a beginning avian ecology book useful for a wide array of people. Professionals will find the text valuable as a brief summary of the ideas, theories, and research in cur- rent avian ecology. Amateurs will find a readable and enjoyable account of the evolutionary approach to birds, and ad- vanced undergraduates will get a good introduction to some of the problems in avian research today. Perrins and Birk- head discuss some complicated topics (resource-based polygyny, ideal-free dis- tributions, coevolution, ultimate and proximate factors) but in a manner al- lowing most readers to understand them. Their use of tables summarizing advan- tages and disadvantages of behavior pat- terns such as coloniality, group foraging, and specific mating systems is also help- ful. All in all, I highly recommend this book to amateurs, advanced undergradu- ates, beginning graduate students, and professionals who want to get a broad overview of this research area.

This holistic perspective, a welcome al- ternative to the reductionism of early social deprivation research, underscores the need for sociobiologists to avoid oversimple models of genetic determin- ism for individual behavior within pri- mate social groups. Hinde has champi- oned these views for years, and the combined research efforts of the 21 con- tributors to this volume come closer than ever before to realizing many of these goals. Most of the authors have contributed several sections to one or more of the November 1984 653</page></plain_text>
