The latest writers on Heraclitus, namely Gustav Teichmuller and Edmund Pfleiderer, have thought it necessary to preface their works with an apology for adding other monographs to the Heraclitic literature, already enriched by treatises from such distinguished men as Schleiermacher, Lassalle, Zeller, and Schuster. That still other study of Heraclitus, however, needs no apology, will be admitted when it is seen that these scholarly critics, instead of determining the place of Heraclitus in the history of philosophy, have so far disagreed, that while Schuster makes him out to be a sensationalist and empiricist, Lassalle finds that he is a rationalist and idealist.

Heraclitus' theology was derived, according to Teichmuller, from Egypt; according to Lassalle, from India; according to Pfleid- erer, from the Greek Mysteries. The Heraclitic flus:, according to Pfleiderer, was consequent on his abstract theories; according to Teichmuller, his abstract theo- ries resulted from his observation of the flus. Pfleid- erer says that Heraclitus was an optimist; Gottlob Mayer says that he was a pessimist. According to Schuster he was a hylozoist, according to Zeller a pan- theist, according to Pfleiderer a panzoist, according to Lassalle a panlogist. Naturally, therefore, in the hands of these critics, with their various theories to support, the remains of Heraclitus' work have suflered a violence of interpretation only partially es:cused by his known obscurity. No small proportion of the fragments, as will be seen in rny introduction, have been taken in a diametrically opposite sense. Recently a contribution towards the disentanglement of this maze has been made by Mr. Bywater, an acute English scholar. His work (Heracliti Ephesii Reli- quiae, Oxford, 1877) is simply a complete edition of the now existing fragments of Heraclitus' work, together with the sources from which they are drawn, with so much of the context as to make them intelligible. Under these circumstances I have thought that a translation of the fragments into English, that every man may read and judge for himself, would be the best contribution that could be made. The increasing interest in early Citreek philosophy, and particularly in Heraclitus, who is the one Glreek thinker most in accord with the thought of our century, makes such a translation justifiable, and the excellent and timely edition of the Greek tes:t by Mr. Bywater makes it practicable.</page><page sequence="3">5tS9 s FERTHER STEDY OF HERACLITES. The translations both of the fragments and of the contes:t are made from the original sources, though I have followed the text of Bywater except in a very few cases, designated in the critical notes. As a number of the fragments are ambiguous, and several of them contain a play upon words, I have appended the entire Greek tes:t. The collection of sources is wholly that of Mr. Bywater. In these I have made a translation, not of all the references, but only of those from which the fragment is immediately taken, adding others only in cases of especial interest. My acknowledgments are due to Dr. Basil L. Gil- dersleeve, of the Johns Hopkins University, for kind suggestions concerning the translation, and to Dr. G. Stanley Hall for valuable assistance in relation to the plan of the work.</page><page sequence="4">560 PATRICK: INTRODUCTION. SECTION I. HISTORICAL AND aRITICAL. Modern Heraclitic literature belongs wholly to the present century. The most important works are the following: Schleiermacher: Herakleitos, der Dunkle von Ephesos, in Wolf and Buttmann's Museum der Alterthumswissenschaft, Vol. I, 1807, PP. 313-533, and in Schleiermacher's Sammt. Werke, Abth. III, Vol. 2, Berlin, 1838, PP. 1-146; Jak. Bernays: Heraclitea, BOnn, 1848; Heraklitische Studien, in the Rhein. Mus., new series, VII, pp. 90-116, 1850; Neue Bruchstucke des Heraklit, ibid. I)E, pp. 241-269, 1854; Die Hera- klitischen Briefe, Berlin, 1869; Ferd. Lassalle: Die Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunkeln von Ephesos, 2 vols., Berlin, 1858 ; Paul Schuster: Heraklit von Ephesus, in Actis soc. phil. Lips. ed. Fr. Ritschelius, 1873,1II,1-397; Teichmuller, };eue Stud. z. Gesch. der Begriffe, Heft I, Glotha, 18763 and II, 1878; Bywater: Heracliti Ephesii Reliquiae, Oxford, 1877; Edmund Pfleiderer: Die Philosophie des Heraklit von Ephesus im Lichte der Mysterienidee, Berlin, 1886; Eduard Zeller: Die Philosophie der Griechen, Bd. I, pp. 566-677. There may be mentioned also the following addi- tional writings which have been consulted in the preparation of these pages: Gottlob Mayer: Heraklit von Ephesus und Arthur Schopenhauer, Heidelberg, 1886; Campbell: Theaetetus of Plato, &amp;ppendis A, Oxford, 1883; A. W. Benn: The Greek Philosophers, London, 1882. After the introductory collection and arrangement of the Heraclitic fragments by Schleiermacher, and</page><page sequence="5">561 A FURTHER StEDY OF HERACLITES. the scholarly discriminative work and additions of Bernays four attempts have been made successively by Lassalle Schuster, Teichmuller, and Pfleiderer, to reconstruct or interpret the philosophical system of Heraclitus. The positions taken and the results arrived at by these eminent scholars and critics are largely, if not wholly, difEerent and discordant. A brief statement of their several positions will be our best introduction to the study of Heraclitus at first hand, and at the same time will offer us incidentally some striking examples of prevalent methods of his- * * . - torlc crltlelsm. One of the greatest evils in circles of philosophical and religious thought has always been the evil of over- systemtzation. It is classification, or the scientific method, carried too far. It is the tendency to arrange under any outlined system or theory, more facts than it will properly include. It is the temptation, in a word, to classify according to resemblances which are too faint or fanciful. In the field of historic criticism this evil takes the form of over-interpretatton. Just as in daily life we interpret every sense perception according to our own rnental forms, so we tend to read our own thoughts into every saying of the ancients, and then proceed to use these, often without dis- honesty, to support our favorite modern systems. The use of sacred writings will naturally occur to every one as the most striking illustration of this over-interpre- tation. Especially in the exegesis of the Bible has this prostitution of ancient writings to every man's religious views been long since recognized and condemned, and if most recently this tendency has been largely cor- rected in religious circles, it is a11 the more deplorable, in philosophical criticism, to find it still flourishing.</page><page sequence="6">562 PATRICE: Unfortunately, this vice continues, and it appears nowhere more plainly than in the interpretation of GEreek philosophy. There is a great temptation to modern writers to use the Greek philosophers as props to support their own systems a temptation to inter- pret them arbitrarily, to look down upon them patron- izingly, as it were, showing that what they meant was this or that modern thought, having only not learned to express themselves as well as we have. Among his- torians of philosophy this appears as a one-sidedness, so that it is commonly necessary in reading a history of philosophy to make a correction for the author's " personal equation." The histories of Schwegler and of Lewes are examples the one biased by Hegel- ianism, the other by Positivism. Undoubtedly, a cer- tain personal equation is unavoidable, and it is as impossible for an interpreter of Glreek philosophy to make himself wholly Glreek as it is unfair to represent the ancient thinker as wholly Glerman or English. But when this becomes complete one-sidedness, or blindness to all but one series of an author's thoughts, or a willful or even unintentional perversion of his words, vigorous remonstrance is called for. This attempt to fully understand the ancients, to make thern speak in the phraseology of sorne modern school, must be distinguished from the recent move- ment, represented bX itrof. Lagarde and others; in interpreting historic thought and historic events psychologically. This movement is certainly legiti- mate, based as it is on the truth of the similarity of constitution of all human minds, and the probability that underlying all representative historic creeds are great related if not identical thoughts. Even here, of course, the attempt to express these thoughts in the set phrases of any one people is inadequate.</page><page sequence="7">563 s FURTHER STUDY OF HERA¢LITE8. We proceed, then, to look at some of the work done upon the philosophy of Heraclitus. Eere we shall not attempt any examination of Zeller's exposition, since his works though it is perhaps the very best that has been done in this field, is critical rather than recon- structive, and like his whole history of Greek phiTos- ophy, is a marvel of candor as well as of immense research. Even Zeller, however, has not wholly escaped the charge of one-sidednessJ since Benn, in the preface to his work on the Greek philosophers, has accused him of never having outgrown the semi-Hege- lian prejudice of his youth. LASSALLE. Lassalle, in two ponderous volumes noted above (page 560), made the first and most elaborate atternpt to reconstruct the system of the Ephesian philosopher. His work exhibits immense labor arld study, and extended research in the discovery of new fragments and of ancient testimony, together with some acuteness in their use. Lassalle has a very distinct view of the philosophy of Heraclitus. But it is not an original view. It is, in fact, nothing but an expansion of the short account of Heraclitus in lIegel's History of Phil- osophy although Lassalle makes no mention of him, except to quote upon his title-page Hegel's well-known motto, " Es ist kein Satz des Heraklit, den ich nicht in meine Logik aufgenommen." Hegel's conception of Heraclitus is, in a word, as follows: Heraclitus' Absolute was the unity of being and non-being. His whole system was an expansion of the speculative thought of the principle of pure becoming. He appre- hended, and was the first to apprehend, the Absolate as a process, as the unity of opposites, as dialectic</page><page sequence="8">564 PATRICE: itself. His great contribution was the speculative transition from the being of the Eleatics to the idea of becoming. Now how does Hegel support this position ? There is in his Logic but one passage referring to Hera- clitus. There he says, " Gl lancing at the principle of the Eleatics, Heraclitus then goes on to say, ' Being no more is than non-being (ov8sw yaiRow TO 8&gt; TOV #§ OSTOs @Tt), a statement expressing the negative nature of abstract leing and its identity with non-being " (Wallace, The Logic of IIegel, p. 144; cp. Science of Logic, Hegel's Werke, Vol. 3, p. 80). Hegel omits, in the Logic, to give the reference to the above quotation, but in his History of Philosophy (Werke, Vol. 13, p. 332) he quotes the same passage with the reference. It is to Aristotle, Metaph. i. 4. We turn to the same and find that it is a passage which Aristotle quotes from the Atomists, Democritus and Leucippus, and that it has not the slightest reference to Heraclitus, Brho, indeed, is not mentioned in the same chapter. This is rather discouraging, but the account in the History of Philosophy, to which we now turns is scarcely less so. There Hegel begins his exposition of Heraclitus as follows: "1. Das allgemeine Princip. Dieser kuhne GEeist (Heraclitus) hat zuerst das tiefe Wort gesagt, ' Das Seyn ist nicht mehr als das Nichtseyn,' es ist ebenso wenig, oder, ' Seyn und Wichts sey dasselbe,' das Wesen sey die Veranderung " (GEesch. d. Phil. Vol. 13 p. 332). Now it happens that Heraclitus said nothing of the kind. As references Hegel gives Aristotle, Meta- phys. i. 4; iv. 7; iv. 3. The first passage, as we have already seen, is from the Atomists. The second turns out upon examination to be simply the expression,</page><page sequence="9">565 A FERTHER STEDY OF HER^CLITUS. " All things are and are not " (ZSTa £7Yat xac g t7waz), and the third is a statement of Aristotle that some people supposed Heraclitus to have said that the same thing could ooth be and not be the same. Moreover, neither of these passages is Heraclitic in form, and they are not even mentioned in Bywater's edition. The ouly expression of Heraclitus that resembles in form the above passage from Aristotle is that of frag 81, ' Into the same river we step and we do not step. _^rwr 1 s * * 1 we are ancl we are not." lne over-:rnterpretatlon ny which this simple passage, expressing incessant phys- ical chanye is transformed into the logical principle of Hegel, "Das Seyn ist nicht mehr als das Nicht- seyn,&gt; " Seyn urld Nichts sey dasselbey' is audacious at least. Furthermore, we may say here in passingX that neither the expressions RQ OYJ #§ 03 nor even TV rq&gt;ovuswov occur in any genuine saying of Heraclitus; although if they did occur, it would be easy to show that they could not mean at all what Hegel meant by being, non-being, and becoming. Even the Eleatic Being was not at all the same with that of Hegela but was finite, spherical, and something very much like that which we should call material But IIeraclitusS who indeed preceded Parmenidesa said nothing of being nor of non-being, nor did he speak of becoming in the abstract although the trustful reader of Hegel Lassalle, or Ferrier might well suppose he spoke of nothing else. That which these writers mistook for becoming was as we shall see later only physical chcmye. With the loss of this corner-stone, the Hera- clitic support of the Hegelian Logic fails, and Hegel's toast that there was no sentence of Heraclitus that his Logic had not taken up becomes rather ludicrous, especially if one will read through the remains oft</page><page sequence="10">566 PATRICE: Heraclitus' work on Nature and search for his rich and varied thoughts in the Logic of Hegel. Returning now to Lassalle, the above principles are carried out more in detail as follows: The chief point in the philosophy of Heraclitus is that here first the formal notion of the speculatinTe idea in general was grasped. With him first emerged the conception of pure thought defecated of the sensuous. His ground principle was the dialectical opposition of being and non-being. The kernel and whole depth of his phil- osophy may be expressed in the one sentence, " Only non-being is " (Lassalle, Vol. 1, p. 35). The unity of being and non-being is a unity of process (processi- rende Einheit). It is the unity of opposites, the idea of becoming, the divine law, the &gt;cts,uq of the determining God (Id. Vol. 1, p. 24). Fire, strife, peace, time, neces- sity, harmony, the way up and down, the flux, justice, fate, Logos, are all different terms for this one idea (Id. Vol. 1, p. 57). Hence arises Heraclitus' obscurity. It is not a mere grammatical obscurity, as Schleier- macher, following Aristotle (Rhet. iii. 5, p. 1407, b. 14) thought; nor is it a willful obscurity, but it arises from the very nature of his great thought, which could not be enunciated in exact terms, but could only be suggested by such words as fire, time, etc., and so he labored on with one new symbol after another, vainly trylng to express himself. The Heraclitic fire is a " metaphysical abstraction " - a pure process, " whose existence is pure self-annull- ing (sich aufheben), whose being is pure self-consump- tion (sich selbst verzehren) " (Lassalle, Vol. 1, p. 18). Most clearly, however, is the great thought of Hera- clitus shown in " the way up and down," which does not involve change of place, but only a logical process.</page><page sequence="11">567 A FERTHER Y OF HERAaLITUS. It is " nothing else " than the change from being into non-being and the reverse. The way down is transi- tion into being; the.way up is the return into the pure and free negativity of non-being, motion in the undis- turbed ideal harmony (Id. Vol. 2, p. 241 ff.). God, in his adequate form, is "nothing else" than pure negativity, the pure unity of process of opposites. Nature is only the corporeal manifestation of the law of the identity of opposites. It owes its existence to privation (a3c'xa), that is, to the injustice which pure becoming suffers when it becomes being (Td. Vol. 1, p. 138). The d&gt;exAv,ecrazc of Heraclitus is not any vapor or sen- sible ez:halation, but is " nothing else " than the way up or the dx7rupcoacc, that is, the cessation of the sen- sible and the particular and the assumption of the real universal becoming. 'Avadvyccoyevac Lassalle says, should be translated " processirend ' (Id.Vol. 1, p. 144). The lIeraclitic flux is thfe same as the way up and down. It is the dialectic of spacial being; it is the unity of being and non-being as spacial; it is the here which is not here. The 'eP'eX°&gt; of Heraclitus is not anything physical or spacial, but " the universal real process of becoming," which works through the Logos or law of thought (Id. Vol. 1, p. 306). The Heraclitic Logos is the pure intelligible logical law of the identity in process (die processirende Iden- titat) of being and non-being. It is " nothing else " than the law of opposites and the change into the same (Id. Vol. 1, p. 327; Vol. 2, p. 265). The substance of the soul is identical with the sub- stance of nature. It is pure becoming which has in- corporated itself, fambraced the way down. The dry or fiery soul is better than the moist because moisture</page><page sequence="12">568 PATRICK: is "nothing else " than a symbol of the downward way. The soul that is moist has descended out of its pure self-annulling mc)vement or negativity in process, into the sphere of the particular and determinate (Id. Vol. 1, pp. 180, 192). Heraclitus, in his desperate labor to express this idea, enters the sphere of religion. Dionysus and Hades are the same, he says (see frag. 127). That is, says Lassalle, Dionysus, the god of generation which repre- sents the descent of pure non-being into being, is iden- tical with Hades, the god of death; and this fragment, which is a polemic against Dionysus, is really a polemic against being, which is inferior to non-being (Id. Vol. 1, p. 208). Knowledge consists in the recognition in each parti- cular thing of the two opposites which constitute its nature (Id. Vol. 2, p. 272)* Of ethics, the formal prin- ciple is self-realization or self-representation. It is the realization of what we are in ourselves or according to our inner nature. The ideal is separation from the sensible and particular and the realization of the uni- versal (Id. Vol. 2, p. 428 ff.). Such in brief outline is what Ferdinand Lassalle finds in Heraclitus' book On Nature. As an e2cposition of Heraclitus it is not worth the space we have given it, or any space, in fact; but as one of the most beau- tiful illustrations of over-systemization, it is extremely valuable. Any formal refutation of his conception of Heraclitus is unnecessary, for almost the whole of it is without any foundation whatever. The expositions which are to follow, or even a slight reading of the fragments themselves, will sufficiently show how thor- oughly fantastic and arbitrary are his interpretations. Lassalle seems to have been misled partly by Hegel's</page><page sequence="13">misinterpretation of the passages from Aristotle not- iced above, and partly by the principle of opposition which runs through a number of the sayings of Hera- clitus an opposition which, as we shall see later, was wholly physical, and farmore simple than the abstruse logical meaEting given it by Lassalle. This Glerman scholar had no power or no wish to put himself in the attitude of the Greek mind, which was as widely dif- ferent from his as possible. It was a mistake for this diseiple of pure thought, bred in the stifling atmosphere of a nineteenth century Hegelian lecture-room, and powerless to transport himself out of it even in thought, to attempt to interpret the sentences of an ingenuous lover of Nature, who, five centuries before the Chris- tian era, lived and moved in the free air of Ephesus. In this we do not mean to say that the philosophy of Heraclitus was purely physical rather than metaphys- ical, for we shall see that such was not the case, but primitive pre-Socratic metaphysics and the panlogism of Lassalle are as wide asunder as the poles. On this point, Benn, in the work already referred to, well says, {' The Greek philosophers from Thales to Democritus did not even suspect the ez:istence of those ethical and dialectical problems which long constituted the sole object of philosophical discussion " (Vol. 1, p. 4). Those who wish to trace Lassalle's orrors further may compare, on his mistaken conception of th;e Hera- clitic fire, Zeller. Vol. 1, p. 591, 31; G#rote: Plato, Vol. 1, p. 33, note. On "the way up and down," com- pare Zeller, Vol. 1, p. 619, 1. On the flus, compare Schuster, p. 201; Zeller, Vol. 1, p. 577, 1. The characterization of Lassalle's book as a whole ' The references to Zeller in the following pages are to the fourth German edition of Die Philosophie der Griechen. 569 A T;TTOtYtT;*O OrlsTT D rt A NT TO X UXlr-IlDSl 1v1 UV1 XJX X;lDliWSJl | UlQ-</page><page sequence="14">570 PATRICE: is, that it is a striking e2cample of great philosophic waste, turning as he does the rich and suggestive phil- osophy of the Ephesian into a wretched mouthful of Hegelian phrases. His citation of so many diverse sentences of E[eraclitus, drawn from theology, ethics, nature, and ulan, and his discovery in all of them of nis single ever-recurring notion of " dis3 reine umschlag- ende Identitat von Sein und Nichtsein," impresses us with the power which the.tyranny of a single idea may have to so blur one's vision as to cause him to see that idea reflected in everything that is presented. It is not true, as Lassallens motto goes, that there is no sen- tence of Heraclitus that Hegel has not incorporated in his Logic, but it is not far from the truth that there is no sentence of Heraclitus which Hegel and Lassalle have not either willfully or ignorantly perverted. SCHUSTER. We will mention now the work of Paul Schuster (see above, p. 560). Schuster approaches the problem of the interpretation of Heraclitus with the advantage of a rich philological and historical knowledge. He suf- fers a disadvantage, however, in the magnitude of the task he undertakes, which is nothing less than the reconstruction of the order and plan of the book of Heraclitus itself. The interpretation of the fragments, he justly observes, depends upon the connection in which they occurred. It will be necessary, therefore, if we will grasp their true sense, to recover the plan of the original writing. Such a reconstruction Schuster holds to be possible, since by the law of selection, the fragments which have been preserved to us must have been the central thoughts of the original work. Con- trary to Schleiermacher, he accepts as trustworthy the</page><page sequence="15">statement of Diogenes (Diog. Laert. ix. b) that the book of Heraclitus was divided into three parts or Logoi, the first concerning "the all," the second poli- tical, the third theological. On this basis Schuster arranges the fragments, freely translated or rather paraphrased, and interspaced with the restored pro- gress of thought. The well known obscurity of our philosopher, Schuster, contrary to all other critics ex- cept Teichmuller, supposes to have been partly, at least, intentional, as a precaution against persecution for atheism.l The distinctive feature of Schuster's conception of Heraclitus is that he was not a distruster of the senses, but on the contrary the first philosopher who dared to base all knowledge upon sense experience. He was therefore the first of experimental philosophers. To this idea the introduction of Heraclitus' book was devoted. The majority of people, says the Ephesian, have little interest in that which immediately sur- rounds them, nor do they think to seek for knowledge by investigation of that with which they daily come in contact (Clement of Alex. Strom. ii. 2, p. 432; M. Aurelius iv. 46; cp. frags. 5, 93). :5revertheless, that which surrounds us is the source of knowledge. Wature is not irrational and dumb, but is an ever living Voice plainly revealing the law of the world. This Voice of Nature is the Heraclitic Logos. The thought which Heraclitus utters in the passage stand- ing at the beginning of his book (frag. 2, Hippolytus, Ref. haer. ix. 9; cp. Aristotle, Rhet. iii. 5, p. 1407, b. 14) is no other than that which since the Renaissance has l Compare Plutarch. Pyth. orac. 21, p. 404; = frag. 11; Clement of Alex. Strom. v. 13, p. 699; = frag. 116. The numbers refer not to Schuster's numbering of the fragments, but to that of the present work, which is the numeration of Bywater. 571 A FURTHER STUDY OF EERACLITUB.</page><page sequence="16">2 PATRICE: inspired natural science and its accompanying specu- lation, namely, that truth is to be won by observation of the visible world. But the people, he complains, despise the revelation which Nature oSers us with audible voice. Why, asks Heraclitus (Hippolytus, Ref. haer. i:S. 9; cp. frag. 47), should an invisible harmony be better than a visible ? It is not better, but, on the contrary, whatever is the object of seeing, hearing, or investigation, that I particularly honor (idem is. 10; cp. frag. 13). Men, therefore, must trust their eyes (Polybius, xii. 27; cp. frag. 15) and not make reckless guesses concerning the weightiest things (Diog. Laert. ix. 73; cp. frag. 48). That HeraclitusS theory of knowl- edge, thx3refore, based it upon se:ase perceptio:n and reflection thereupon, is shown, continues Schuster, not ouly by the above passages but also by the fact that the exaggerated form of the theory held by Protagoras (cp. Platos Theaetetus) must necessarily have had its source in Heraclitus his master. iNone the less is this shown also by Parmenides' attack on the empirical theory of knowledge (Sestus Empir. vii. 3), which could have been aimed only at the philoso- pher of Ephesus (Schuster, pp. 7 and 13-42). Turning now from the theory of knowledge to its results the first law which the observation of liature teaches us is the law of eternal and recurrent mo- tion (rd&gt;ra XoPsv zae °u8sw ,Rvez, Plato, Crat. p. 402 A). The starting point and central position of our philoso- pher we must find in this recurrent motion, rather than in the primitive fire which itself held a subordi- nate place in the system. But the Heraclitic motion was not conceived as any absolute molecular change in the modern sense, nor yet as that absolute insta- bility which appeared in the nihilism of the later</page><page sequence="17">573 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. Heracliteans. It was rather conceived in a simpler way, as a general law that everything comes to an end and there is nothing permanent. Under this was included: 1) spacial motion, as of the flowing river; 2) qualitative change as in the human body; 3) a kind of periodicity which brings everything under its dominion. The last was the most emphasized. Birth and death are universal; nothing escapes this fate. There is no fixed or unmoved being above or outside the shifting world, no divine heavenly existenge that does not change, but all is involved in the same perpetual ebb and flow, rise and fall, life and death (Schuster, p. 81 fE.). But this life and death of the universe is literal, not figurative. The world itself is a great living organism subject to the same alternation of elemental fire, air, and water. This thoroughgoing hylozoism which Schuster attributes to Heraclitus, he bases principally on the writing de dtaeta of Pseudo-Hippocrates, who, he believes, made a free use of the work of Heraclitus, if he did not directly plagiarize from him. Comparing this writing (particularly the passage, c. 10, p. 638) with Platos Timaeus (p. 40 A, also drawn from Eera- clitus), he ventures to reconstruct the original asz follows: " Everything passes away and nothing per-- sists. So it is with the river, and so with mortal beings; in whom continually fire dies in the birth of air, and air in the birth of water. So also with the divine heavenly existence, which is subject to the same process, for we are in reality only an imitation of that and of the whole world; as it happens with that so it must happen with us, and inversely we may judge of that by ourselves ' (Schuster, p. 118). The life principle of the universe, as of the htlman</page><page sequence="18">57£ PATRICK: organism, is fire. This fire is everywhere present, so that "everything is full of gods and souls" (Diog. Laert. ix. T). The life of the body is sustained by the breath which inhales the dry vapors kindred to fire. At night, when the sun is extinguished and the world becomes unconscious, we inhale the dark wet vapors and sink into death-like sleep (Schuster, p. 135). The sun, which is new every day, changes at night into the surrounding air and then into the water of the sea. The sea produces the daily sun, as it is the source of all earthly phenomena. On a large scale this three- fold change takes place with the universe, which will ultimately be consumed in fire, again to become sea and cosmos. This is " the way up and down " not a circular movement of the elements within the cosmos (Zeller), but the periodicity of the world itself. The way up and the way down relate only to the cosmogony. The latter is the creation of the world by condensation of fire into water, then earth; the former is the reverse process of vaporization (Id. p. 169). This law or order is not dependent upon any divine purposeful will, but all is ruled by an inherent neces- sary " fate." The elemental fire carries within itself the tendency toward change, and thus pursuing the way down, it enters the " strife ' and war of opposites srhich condition the birth of the world (aza;!ovy7yaz;), and e2cperience that hunger (tpa,avau&gt;a) which arises in a state where life is dependent upon nourishment, and where satiety (xopo) is only again found when, in pursuit of the way up, opp6sites are annulled, and " unity " and '; peace " again emerge in the pure original fire (@XztJpat).

The Heraclitic harmony of opposites, as of the bow and the lyre, is a purely physical harmony. It is simply the operation of the strife of opposite fotces, by which motion within an organism, at the point where if further continued it would endanger the whole, is balanced and caused to return within the limits of a determined amplitude (Id. p. 230 ff.). The identity of opposites means only that very dif- ferent properties may unite in the same physical thing, either by simultaneous comparison with different things or successive comparison with a changeable thing (Id. pp. 236, 243). The second or political section of Heraclitus' work treated of arts, ethics, society, and politics. It aimed to show how human arts are imitations of Nature, and how organized life, as in the universe and the indi- vidual, so in the state, is the secret of unity in variety. The central thought was the analogy existing between man and the universe, between the microcosm and the macrocosm, from which it results that the true ethical principle lies in imitation of Nature, and that law is founded on early customs which sprang from Nature (Id. p. 310 ff.). The third or theological section was mainly devoted to showing that the names of things are designations of their essence. That Heraclitus himself, not merely his followers, held the 5nuase Op8OT§f OSO#aT@S, and used etymologies as proofs of the nature of things, Schuster believes is both consistent with his philosophy and conclusively proved by Plato's Cratylus. Primitive men named things from the language which Nature spoke to them; names, therefore, give us the truth of</page><page sequence="20"> PATRICR: things. Etymologies of the names of the gods was the proof first brought forward, as in Plato's CDratyluvs; hence the name of this section of the work. To show this connection of narnes and things was to prove the intimate connection of man with STature, and so to lead to the conclusion that all knowledge is based on experience, which, indeed, was the end he had in view (Id. p. 317 fE.). It is not our purpose to criticize in detail Schuster's conception of Heraclitus. Much of it will commend itself to the careful student of the remains, particu- larly that which relates to the Heraclitic flux and its relation to the primitive fire. Suggestive, also, if not unimpeachable, is his conception of the relation of the microcosm to the macrocosm, and of the harmony and identity of opposites. In his exposition of these doctrines, Schuster has rendered valuable service. We can by no means, however, allow thus tentatively to pass, Schuster's conception of Heraclitus as a purely empirical philosopher. Before noticing this, a word needs to be said in regard to Schuster's method as a whole. As to the latter, the very e2ctent of the task proposed made over-systemization inevitable. In criticism of Schuster's attempt, Zeller has well said that with the e2atant material of Heraclitus' book, the recovery of its plan is impossible (Vol. 1, p. 570, note). Such a plan of reconstruction as that which Schuster undertakes, demands the power not only to penetrate the sense of every fragment, but also soto readthemind of the author as to be able to restore that of the large absent portions. The small number and enigmatical character of the fragments which are extant, together with the contradictory character of ancient testimony to Heraclitus, makes such a task e2ctremely hazardous.</page><page sequence="21">577 A FURTHER STEDY 0F HERACLITUS. It can be carried through only by the help of " unlim- ited conjecture." Such conjecture Schuster has used extensively. The necessity of carrying through his plan has led him to find in some passages more mean- ing than they will justly bear, while his apparently preconceived notion as to the wholly empirical charac- ter of the system has led him to distort the meaning of many sentences. We shall see examples of this presently. Incidentally, his method may be illustrated by his connection and use of the two passages: d&gt;0focorov; yev&lt;z d;roSavovror&lt;, avaa oux sA;rov:ezz ov8e 30xsovve (Clement of Ales. Strom. iv. 22, p. 630; cp. frag. 122), and a? sbuxac O(J#@ST! X02 f28§S (Plutarch, de Fac. in orbe lun. 28, p. 943; cp. frag. 38). Schuster conjectures that these passages came together in the original work, and he renders and interprets them as follows: " There awaits men in death what they neither hope nor believe," namely, rest and the joy of a sleep-like con- dition (!), so that even instinctively " souls scent out death," desiring to obtain it (Schuster, p. 190). Not to speak of the forced translation of the latter fragment, only the most vivid imagination would think of using these passages in this way, especially as Clement himself, in his use of the firstpassage, refers it to the punishments which happen to men after death (see below, frags. 122 and 124, sources), and Plutarch, in respect to the second, uses it as proof that souls in Hades are nourished by vapors (see below, frag. 38, sources). But Schuster's conception of Heraclitus did not admit of belief in a distinot life after death, and it was necessary to make these passages fit in with the plan. ThX3 attempt to weave the fragments into a con- nected whole, and their division into the three Logoi, may be regarded on the whole as a decided failure.</page><page sequence="22">.57&amp; PATRICE: Schuster finds only thirteen fragments for the con- cluding theological section, although our kno-wledge of Heraclitus and his times would rather indicate, as indeed Teichmuller thinks probable, that the theo- logical section was the principal portion of the book. Turning now to the theory of knowledge, according to Schuster, as we have seen, Heraclitus is an empiri- cist and sensationalist and kno^rs no world but the visible. With this conclusion we cannot agree. Schus- ter's argument that this doctrine must have arisen with Heraclitus since it was held by Protagoras, his disciple, has little weight. The order of development was rather that pointed out by Plato himself in the Theaetetus (p. 151 ff.), namelyS that the sensational theory of knowledge was the outcome of the Protagorean doc- trine that Inan is the measure of all things, and that this in turn grew out of the Heraclitic flux. No doubt the sensational theory was implied by the Sophists, but it was inciplent with them and not yet formulated. Much less can it be attributed to Heraclitus, whose colltribution to the theory loegan and ended xvith the eternal flus. A sensational theory of knowledge, it is quitetrue, was likely to be an outcome of the Ephe- sian's philosophy, but he did not himself proceed thus far. The question, theoretically considered, was be- yond his time. There are passages which indicate that he held, inconsistently it may be, quite the oppo- site doctrine. " Eyes and ears," he says, "are bad witnesses to men having rude souls" (Sextus Emp. adv. Math. vii. 126 ;=frag. 4; cp. frags. 3, a, 6,19, etc., and below (p. 609). The passage which offers Schuster the strongest support for his sensationalism is that noted above (p. 572) from Hippolytus, " Whatever concerns seeing, hearing and learning (,act#^§az*, Schuster</page><page sequence="23">579 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITES. translates ( Erforschung "), I particularly honor " (frag. 13). Adopting the simplest and most natural meaning of this passage, it has no bearing on any theory of knowledge, but means merely, as Pfleiderer points out (Heraklit, p. 64, note), that Heraclitus prefers the pleasures of the higher senses, as of seeing, hearing, and the knowledgx3 acquired thereby, to the sensual pleasures of the lower senses which the masses pursue. Ifn however, Schuster will take it in a theoretical sense, then it comes into conflict with the other passagen " The hidden harmony is better than the visible. " The contradiction is foreseen by Schuster, who deliberately changes the latter into a question (see above, p. 572), without a shadow of right, as may be seen by reference to the context in Hippolytus (see below, frag. 47), who e2rpressly states that the two passages seem to conflict. Further support for his interpretation Schuster seeks in the following passage from Hippolytus: Tov 3e sorov TOV8} dOSTOf assc dYvptroc rcYovTac avAproc xae27rpov#pv q dxouvae xac dxouva&gt;rs; TO 7rpt0TO&gt;. tCYO/lRY@S rajo 7raSTfoS XraTa TOY iotoY TON)48&lt; drpc,oozvt doexavt srsepbe),*&gt;oz xac dgTez. &gt; xas ePr&gt; TOtOVTR(t)Y OXOt'(l)Y ar 8tCtRv,Aat, ozatp;'ov EXaXtTOS XOtTA 50,'JfJ!S XOtC 5)p(ItCUS OXh1); gX! (Ref. haer. ix. 9; = frag. 2). This is the passage of which Schuster says that if Heraclitus had written nothing more it would have given him a place of honor in philosophy, for here for the first time appeared the thought that has inspired speculation and modern science since the Renaissance, that truth is to be sought in the observation of Nature. But we are unable to find here any such meaning. The sense of the passage depends upon tha sense of Logos. Of course, if Schuster is free to translate this word in any way he chooses, he can get from the pas-</page><page sequence="24">580 PATRIC:E: sage almost any meaning. He chooses to render it the Voice of Nature or the Speech of the visible world. In this he is not supported by any other critics. By ancient commentators of Heraclitus the Logos was understood as Reason, and in this general sense it is taken by modern commentators including Heinze, Zeller, Teichmuller, and Pfleiderer, although more specifically they see that, in harmony with the whole Heraclitic philosophy, it is to be taken as Reason immanent in the world as Order or Law. Schuster objects that Logos could not mean Reason, since before the time of Heraclitus it had never been so used, and no author would venture to introduce at the very beginning of his work words with new tneanings. But precisely the same objection applies to its meaning the Speech of Nature, for the whole point in Schuster's exposition is that this was an original idea with Heraclitus. If the Logos is conceived as Order, this objection is met, since this meaning is given in the derivation of the word. Moreover, if Schuster could show that the word meant " speech " or " discourse," then the discourse referred to must have been not that of Nature but of the author himself. Finally, if we adopt Reason as the meaning of Logos here, the whole passage, so far from supporting, directly refutes Schuster's sensational theory of knowledge. Another argument for the empiricism of Heraclitus, Schuster seeks in his denunciation of the people for their failure to interest themselves in acquiring knowledge by empirical investigation of the things that surround thern, which he bases on a couple of passages from Clement and M. Aurelius (see above, p. 571). Heracli- tus, in fact, said nothing of the kind; but Schuster, by conjectural reconstruction of the text and an arbitrary</page><page sequence="25">581 A FERTHER STUDY OF BERSCLITES. translation, extracts a theoretical meaning frore simple sentences which no one who had not a preconceived theory to support would ever imagine to mean more than a reproach upon the masses for their superficiality and neglect of interest in a deeper knowledge of the world (see Schuster, p. 17, and cp. frags. .a, 93). What Heraclitus' theory of knowledge really was we shall see more fully in the examination of Pfleiderer's posi- tion later. Here it is sufficient to add that, whatever empirical tendency his philosophy may have had, any such positive doctrine as that which Schuster ascribes to him was far beyond the time of Heraclitus. Schuster's interpretation of the Heraclitic xp;1aJloav&gt; and xopos is also open to criticism. Zeller, indeed, has given a similar explanation of these words (Vol. 1, p. 641), but Pfleiderer has understood them differently (p. 176). From Heraclitus himself there remains only the two above words (frag. 24). Hippolytus (Ref. haer. is. 10, cp. frag. 24, sources) says that the arrangement of the world (azaxovyaz*), Heraclitus called "crav- ing" (xpayoav&gt;a), and the conflagration of the world (2xriJp(ovts) he called " satiety" (xopos). Schuster, therefore, understanding by 8zaxds,cl;1ats, not the process of world-building, that is, the passing of the homoge- neous original fire into the manifold of divided exist- ence, but the completed manifold world itself or the xos,uo*, interprets the " craving " or hunger as belong- ing to the present differentiated world, which hungers, as it were, to get back into the state of c)riginal fire or satiety. The testimony is too meagre to say that this is not a possible interpretation, but it seems to be wrong. For Schuster admits, as of course he must, that the original fire carries within itself an impulse to change and develop into a manifold world. But</page><page sequence="26">582 PATRIC1{: this impulse to change is hardly consistent with a state of perfect " satiety." If now we take 8zaxosf&gt;Cazs in its primary signification denoting the action or pro- cess of arranging, then craving becomes the designa- tion of the world-building process itself. Craving then is nothing but the original impulse to evolve itself, contained in the primitive fire, while the reverse pro- cess, the conflagration, is satiety, or better, the result of satiety. TEICHMULLER. The work of Teichmuller (see above, p. a60) does not profess to be a complete exposition of the philosophy of Heraclitus, but to indicate rather the direction in which the interpretation is to be found. Teichmuller believes that the philosophy of the ancients is to be interpreted by their theories of Nature. Physics came before metaphysics. Particularly does this apply to Heraclitus of Ephesus. His philosophy of Wature, therefore, is the key with which Teichmuller will unlock the secrets of his system (Teichmuller, I, p. 3). But yet Heraclitus was not a naturalist. Of the sun, moon, eclipses, seasons, or earth, he has little to say. In the astronomy of Anaximander or the mathe- matics of Pythagoras he took little interest. On such polymathy he cast a slur (Diog. Laert. ix. 1; cp. frag. 16). He went back to Thales and started from his childlike conception of Nature. To Heraclitus the earth was flat, extending with its land and sea indefinitely in each direction. The sun, therefore, describes only a semicircle, kindled every morning from the sea and extinguished in it every evening. Moreover, the sun is no larger than it looks (Diog. Laert. ix. 7). The sun, therefore, cannot pass his boundaries (of the half- circle), else the Erinyes (who inhabit the lower world)</page><page sequence="27">583 ^ FURTHER STEDY OF HER^CLITES. will find him out (Plutarch, de E:xil. ii. p. 604; - frag. 29)* Up and down are not relative but absolute directions (Teichmuller, I, p. 14). Thus upon physical grounds we may interpret at once some of the aphorisms. For instance, since the sun is a daily exhalation from the earth, sun and eart must have in part a comon substance; hence Diony- sus and Hades are the same (Clement of Alex. Protrept. ii p. 30; cp. frag. 127), since the former stalads for the sun alad the latter for the lower world. Likewise day and night are the same (Hippolytus, Ref. haer. ix. 10; cp. frag. 35), since they are essentially of the same elements, the difference being only one of degree, the former having a preponderance of the light and dry, the latter of the dark and moist (Teichmuller, I, pp. 26, 56). The four elements, fire, air, earth, and water, are not, as with Empedocles, unchangeable elements, but in ceaseless qualitative change are continually passing into one another. Experience itself teaches this in the daily observation of such phenomena as the drying up of swamps, the melting of solids, and the evapo- ration of liquids (Id. I, p. 58)* Fire is not a sylnbol, but is real fire that burns and crackles. It is the ground principle, the entelechy of the world, in which reside life, soul, reason. It is God himself. It is absolute purity. It rules in the pure upper air, the realm of the sun. Its antithesis is moisture, absolute impurity, whicll rules in the lower regions of the earth. The sun with his clear light moves in the upper fiery air. The moon with her dimmed light moves in the lower moister air. The central thought, therefore, is purification, or '; the way up," from the moist and earthy to the dry and fiery (Id. I, p. 62 fE.).</page><page sequence="28">584 PATRICE: The psychology of lIeraclitus is not analogous, but identical with his physics. The soul is the pure, light, fiery, incorporeal principle which burns like the sun. Its degree of life and intelligence depends upon its purity from moisture. The stupid drunken man has a moist soul (Stobaeus Floril. v. 120; cp. frag. 73). " The dry soul is the wisest and best " (frag. 749. In sleep the fire principle burns low; in death it is extinguished, when the soulj like the sun at night, sinks into the dark regions of Hades. Hence it follows that there was srith Heraclitus no doctrine of the immortality of the soul (Teichmuller, I, p. 74 fE.). Ethics, therefore, is purification, and in this thought we see the origin of that general idea which as "Catharsis" became prominent in Plato and later philosophy. Teichmuller finds it of the greatest interest to have traced the history of this idea, with its related one of " separation " or " apartness," back to Heraclitus. " Of all whose words I have heard," says the latter, " no one has attained to this to know that Wisdom is apart (xzxcopcvyevov) from all" (Sto- baeus Floril. iii. 81; = frag. 18). This ;' separateness " of Wisdom, which was only another term for reason, God or pure fire, reveals the origin of the distinction of the immaterial from the material. With Hera- clitus, to be sure, the idea of immateriality in its later sense was not present, but fire as the most incorporeal being of which he knew, identical with reason and intelligence, was set over against the crude material world. We have therefore here neither spirstualism nor crude materialism, but the beginning of the dis- tinction between the two. With Anaxagoras another step was taken when fire was dropped and the Nous was conceived in pure separateness apart even from</page><page sequence="29">585 A FERTHER STUDY OF HER ACLITE S. fire. Following Ana:x:agoras, Plato regarded the Ideas as distinct and separate (tis!Xpt&gt;pc, XPX0pt#j&gt;O&gt;). In Aristotle it appears as the separation (Zdpearow) which belongs to absolute spirit or pure form. Finally in the New Testament it is seen as the purity (p!xpc&gt;pea) which is opposed to the flesh (Paul, Epist. to (:orinth. II, i. 12; ii. 179. Human intelligence, according to Heraclitus, attains only in the case of a few to this greatest purity, this highest virtue, this most perfect knowledge. They are the chosen ones, the elect (@xaSxroc) (Teichmuller, I, p. 112 f.). The senses, since they partake of the earthy char- acter of the body, give us only deceitful testimony as compared with the pure light of Reason which alone, since it is of the essence of all things, that is, fire, has the power to know all. Here therefore was the first distinction of the intelligible from the sensible rorld (Id. I, p. 97). Again, in the qualitative change of Heraclitus we discover the incipient idea of the actual and potential first formulated by Aristotle. Since the elements pass into one another, they must be in some sense the same. Water is fire and fire is water. But since water is not actually fire, it must be so potentially. To express this idea, Heraclitus used such phrases as '; self-con- cealment," "sunset," "death," "sleep," "seed" (Id. I, p. 92 fE.). Moreover inasmuch as we have a progress from the potential to the actual, from the moist and earthy to the dry and fiery that is, fromthe worse to the better, we find in Heraclitus the recognition of an end or purpose in Nature, or a sort of teleology, subject, how- ever, to the rule of rigid necessity (Id. I, p. 137). Thf3 flu2i: of all things Teichmuller understands not</page><page sequence="30">586 PATBICE: as a metaphysical proposition, but as a physical truth gained by generalization from direct observation of Nature. Furthermore, it was nothing new, all the philosophers from Thales on having taught the motion of things between beginning and end (Id. I, p. 121). That which was new in this part of Heraclitus' work was his opposition to the transcendentalism of Xeno- phanes. Over against the absolute, unmoved and undivided unity of the Eleatic philosopher, lIera- clitus placed the unity of opposition. In Xenophanes' system, above all stood the immovable, transcendent God. In Heraclitus' system there was nothing tran- scendent or immovable, but all was pursuing the endless way upward and downward. His ()od was ceaselessly taking new forms. Gods become men, and men gods (Heraclitus, Alleg. Hom. 24, p. 51, Mehler; cp. frag. 67). The immanent replaces the transcendent. Here emerges the historically significant idea of unity. Against the unity of Xenophanes, a unity opposed to the manifold, Heraclitus grasped the idea of a unity which includes the manifold within itself. "Unite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accor- dant and disaccordant from all comes one, and Xrom one all " (Arist. de mundo 5, p. 396, b. 12; = frag. 59). Everywhere is war, but from the war of opposites re- sults the most beautiful harmony (cp. frag. 46). lIere three principles are involved: 1). Through strife all things arise; the birth of water is the death of fire, the death of water is the birth of earth, etc. (cp. frag. 68). 2). Through strife of opposites all things are preserved; take away one, the other falls; sickness is conditioned by health, hunger by satiety (cp. frag. 104). 3). There is an alternating mastery of one or the other oppo- site; hence it follows that since all opposites proceed</page><page sequence="31">587 A FERTHER STEDY OF HERACLITES. from one another, they are the same (Teichmuller, I, p. 130 ff.). What did Heraclitus mean by the visible and invis- ible harmony? Teichmuller censures Schuster for failingto recognize that most significant side of Hera- clitus' philosophy which is represented by the invisible harmony in other words, for reducing him to a mere sensationalist. The visible harmony, according to Teichmuller, is the entire sensible world, in which the war of opposites results in a harmony of the whole. But the invisible harmony is the divine, all-ruling and all-producing Wisdom or World-reason, concealed from the senses and the sense-loving masses and revealed only to pure intellect. Thus Heraclitus, to whom there was an intelligible world revealing itself to intellect alone, and in the recognition of which was the highest virtue, was the forerunner of Plato (Id. I, pp. 154, 161 ff.). By the Logos of Heraclitus was indicated Law, Truth, Wisdom, Reason. It was more than blind law, thinks Teichmuller, it was self-conscious intelligence; for self-consciousness, according to Heraclitus, who praised the Delphic motto, "linow thyself" is the highest activity of man, and how could he attribute less to GUod, from whom man learns like a child ? (cp. frag. 97). But this self-conscious reason is not to be understood as a constant, ever abiding condition. God, who in this purely pantheistic system is one with the world, is himself subject to the eternal law of ceaseless change, pursuing forever the downward and upward way. But is not then (kd, Logos, Reason, subject, after all, to some higher destiny (s&gt;apyev^q) ? No, says Teichmuller, for it is this very destiny which it is the highest wisdom in man to recognize, and</page><page sequence="32">588 PATRIC15: which is, therefore, identical with the Wisdom which rules all. The difficulty here he so far admits, how- ever, as to acknowledge that this doctrine is dark and undetermined " (Id. I, p. 183 fE.). Finally, says our author, there was no idea of per- sonality of spirit in the philosophy of Heraclitus, as there was not in any G#reek philosopher from Xeno- phanes to Plotinus (Id. I, 187). In closing this part of his exposition, Teichmuller calls attention to the relation of Heraclitus to Ana2i;- agoras. M. Heinse (Lehre vom Logos, p. 33), following Aristotle, attributes to Anasagoras the introductior into philosophy of the idea of world-ruling intelligence. But, says Teichmuller, this idea was present to every Greek from Homer oll. Its recognition by Hera- clitus has been shown by the fact that everywhere he attributes to his GUod, wisdom (a05De), intelligent Tvill (^rvd,§), reason ((DpO&gt;OUp and (ppewrlpe), and recog- nized truth (Aoro*). What then did Anaxagoras add ? The history of the idea of trarlscendent reason turrls upon two characteristics, Identity (rabror;7c) and Pure Separation (etAtxpc&gt;sc). With Heraclitus both failed; -the former, because the World Intelligence took part in the universal change; the latter, because it was mingled with matter. For, in choosirlg fire for his intelligent principle, although as Aristotle says he chose that which was least corporeal (&amp;a#arcUraTow), he did not escape a sort of materialism. The new that Anaxagoras added, therefore, was the complete sepa- ration of reason from materiality. In a word, while the Logos of the Ephesian was at once world-soul and matter in endless motion, the Nous of Anaxagoras was motionless, passionless, soulless and immaterial. Iden- tity, the other attribute, was added in the epoch-</page><page sequence="33">589 A FIJRTI1ER STEDY OF EERACLITES. making work of Socrates when the content of reason was determined by the definition, following whom Plato established the complete transcendence of the ideal world (Teichmuller, I, 189 ff.). Heraclitus assumed a world-year or world-period, the beginning of which was the flood, and whose end was to be a universal conflagration, the whole to be periodically repeated forever. In this he was preceded by Anaximander and followed by the Stoics. This general idea was adopted by the Christian Church, but the latter limited the number of worlds to three, the first ending with the flood; ours, the second, to end with the conflagration of the world; the third to be eternal (Epist. Pet. II, iii. 4 ff.; Clement of Rome, Epist. to Corinth. i. 57, 58); (Teichmuller, I, 198 ff.). In the second part of his work, Teichmuller enters upon an exhaustive argument to show the dependence of the Heraclitic philosophy upon Egyptian theology. Heraclitusmoved within the sphere of religiousthought. He praised the Sibyl and defended revelation and in- spiration (Plutarch, de Pyth. orac. 6, p. 397; cp. frag. 12). His obscure and oracular style, lile that of the king at Delphi (cp. frag. 11), was in conformity with his religious character. Observation of Nature he fully neglected, depending for his sources more than any other philosopher upon the beliefs of the older theo- logy. Without deciding how far Heraclitus is directly, as a student of the Book of Death, or indirectly by connection with the Glreek Mysteries, dependent upon the religion of Egypt, he proceeds to indicate the interesting points of similarity between them (Teich- muller, II, p. 122). Among the Egyptians the earth was flat and infi- nitely extended. The visible world arose out of water.</page><page sequence="34">590 PATRICE: The upper world belonged to fire and the sun. As tlle sun of Heraclitus was daily generated from water, so Horus, as Ra of the sun, daily proceeded from Lotus the water. &amp;s the elements with Heraclitus proceed upward and downward, so the gods of the elements upon the steps in Hermopolis climb up and down (Id. II, p. 143). With these illustrations, it is sufficient to say, with- out following him further in detail, that Teichmuller carries the comparison through the whole system of Heraclitus, and parallels his actual and potential, his unity of opposites, his eternal flux, strife, harmony, purification, Logos, and periodicity of the world, with similar notions found in the religion of Egypt. In order to appreciate the worth of Teichmuller's work, it is necessary to remember that, as we have said, it does not profess to be a unified exposition of Hera- clitus' philosophy, but a contribution to the history of philosophic ideas in their relation to him. In afford- ing this service to the history of ideas, he has thrown a good deal of light upon the true interpretation of the philosophy of Heraclitus. But the very purpose of his task has caused him to put certain of the ideas into such prominence, that ullless we are on our guard, we shall not get therefrom a well proportioned conception of the system as a whole. We shall do well, conse- quently, to make a short examination of the work out- lined in the foregoing pages, to put the results, if we can, into their fit relation to the whole. Concerning Teichmuller's starting point, namely, that the physics of Heraclitus is the key to his vvhole thought, we must observe, in passing, the inconsist- ency between the first part of Teichmuller's book,</page><page sequence="35">591 A FERTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. where this principle is made the basis of interpretation, and the second part, where it sinks into comparative insignificance when he discovers that Heraclitus is primarily a theologian and gets his ideas from Egyptian religion. To say that we shall better appreciate a philosopher's position if we understand his astronomy and his theories of the earth and nature, is of course true to every one. Moreover, that Heraclitus con- sidered the earth as flat, the sun as moving in a semi- circle and as no larger than it looks, the upper air as drier than the lower, and the lower world as dark and wet, there is no reason to deny. In fact, this cosmology, as Teichmuller details it, is so simple and blends so well with the Heraclitic sayings in gelleral, that the picture of it once formed can hardly be banished from the mind. But that it adds much to the explication of the philosophy as a whole is doubtful. It is true that physics came before metaphysics, if by that is meant that merl speculated about Nature before they speculated about being. But this distinction has little bearing on the interpretation of Heraclitus. A prin- ciple more to the point, and one that Teichmuller has not always observed, is that religion, poetry and metaphor came before either physics or metaphysics. lfrom the very fact, also, that physics came hefore metaphysics, when the latter did come, men were compelled to express its truths in such physical terms as they were in possession of. He therefore who will see in the sentences of Heraclitus nothing beyond their physical and literal meaning, will miss the best part of his philosophy. For instance, Teichmuller interprets the saying that day and night are the saine, as meaning that they are made up of the same physical constitu- ents (see above, p. 583). If possible, this is worse than</page><page sequence="36">592 PATRIGK: Schuster's explanation that they are the same because they are each similar divisions of time (!), an explana- tion which Teichmuller very well ridicules (Id.

No such childish interpretations of this passage are necessary when it is seen that this is simply another antithesis to express Heraclitus' great thought of the unity of opposites, on the ground that by the universal law of change, opposites are forever passing into each other, as indeed is said in so many words in a passage from Plutarch which these critics seem to have slighted (Consol. ad Apoll. 10, p. 106; see frag. 78). Equally unnecessary and arbitrary is Teichmuller's singular attempt to prove on physical grounds the identity of the two gods, Dionysus and Hades (see above, p. 583). In pursuance of his method, Teichmuller supposes that the Heraclitic fire was real fire such as our senses perceive, fire that burns and crackles and feels warm. No other critic agrees with him in this. Zeller espec- ially opposes this conception (Vol. I; p. 588). It is not to be supposed that Teichmuller understands Hera- clitus to mean that the present world and all its phenomena are real fire. Fire he conceives to be, rather, the first principle or dpxa, the real essence of the universe, chosen as water was by Thales or air by Anaximenes, only with more deliberation, since fire has the peculiarity of taking to itself nourishment. In a word, since anybody can see that our present earth, water, and air, are not fire that burns and crackles, all that Teichmuller can mean is that this kind of fire was the original thing out of which the present world was made. But there is not the least support for this meaning in any saying of Heraclitus. In all the sen- tences, fire is conceived as something of the present,</page><page sequence="37">593 A BURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. something directly involved in the ceaseless change of the world. "Fire, (z. e., xtpauvos, the thunderbolt)," he says, "rules all" (Hippolytus, Ref. haer. ix. 10; - frag. 289. "This world, the same for all, neither any of the gods nor any man has made, but it always was, and is, and shall be, an ever living fire " ((:lement of Alex. Strom. v. 14, p. 711; = frag. 20). ; Fire is exchanged for all things and all things for fire" (Plutarch, de EI. 8, p. 388;-frag. 22). These passages are sufficient to show that Teichmuller's conception of the fire is untenable. We may, however, rnention the fact noted by Zeller (Vol. I, p. 588), that both Aristotle (de An. i. 2, 40S, a, 25) and Simplicius (Phys. 8, a) explain that Heraclitus chose to call the world fire " in order to express the absolute life of Nature, and to make the restless change of phenomena comprehen- sible. " Another point that demands criticism is the idea of actuality and potentiality which Teichmuller finds hidden in Heraclitus' philosophy and metaphorically expressed by sunsetS death, sleep, etc. Since there is a qualitative interchange of the elements, they must be in some sense the same. Water is fire and fire is water. But since water is not actually fire, it must be so potentially. Therefore, water is potential fire. Such is Teichmuller's reasoning, as we have seen. Of course, it can be reversed with equal right. Since fire is not actually water, it must be so potentially. There- fore, fire is potential water. Which is to say that we have here a simple reversible series in which there is not only an etereal progress (or regress) from fire to water, but equally, and under the same conditions, an eternal regress (or progress) from water to fire. Either, therefore, may, with as good right as the other,</page><page sequence="38">594 PATRICK: represent actuality or potentiality. In other words, actuality and potentiality are superfluous ideas in this system. In fact, this antithesis has no place in meta- physics outside the philosophy of Aristotle, and he who has failed to see that right in this connection lies the main difEerence between the philosophy of Aris- totle and that of Heraclitus, has missed the most vital part of the latter. With Aristotle there is an eternal progress but no regress. The potential is ever passing into the actual, but not the reverse. To be sure, a thing may be both actual and potential, but not as regards the same thing. The hewn marble is potential as regards the statue and actual as regards the rough marble, but of course the hewn marble and the statue cannot be reciprocally potential or actual. Matter is eternally becoming form, but not the reverse. Thus follows Aristotle's necessary assumption of a prime mover, an inexhaustible source of motion, itself un- moved-pure actuality, without potentiality. Herlce the mainspring of the peripatetic philosophy is the unmoved rnovtng Jirst cause. But the philosophy of the Ephesian is the reverse of all thist With him there is no fixed being whatever (see Teichmuller him- self, I, p. 121: " Es bleibt dabei nichts Eestes zuruck," etc.), no unmoved first cause outside the shifting world which is its own GEod and prime mover. Thus Teichmuller, in identifying the Heraclitic fire with the Aristotelian pure actuality, overlooked the slight difEer- ence that while the one is absolute motion, the other is absolute rest ! We are glad, however, not to find this Aristotelian notion, which, though prevalent in meta- physics, has never added a ray of light to the subject, present in the philosophy of the Ephesian, and we see here another case of over-interpretation by which</page><page sequence="39">595 A o.rsTTn omrs Ar vrD A fsr TmTTC! £ U-Da D1 U; Vn Dsswnss UDv Heraclitus' innocent use of such terms as sunset, death, and self-concealment, caused Aristotelian metaphysics to be forced upon him. In tracing the history of ideas, much emphasis has been laid bDr Teichmuller, as we have seen, upon the iclea of purification (xd(3apac;) as it appears in Hera- clitus, and in connection therewith he has found the beginning of the idea of the " apartness " or " separa- tion " of the immaterial world, an idea so enormously enlarged by Anaxagoras and Plato. As regards the Catharsis proper, Teichmuller has rendered a service by pointing out Heraclitus' connection with the idea; but in reading Teichmuller's book, one would be easily led to believe that the Catharsis idea is much more prominent in Heraclitus than it really is, and as regards the doctrine of ;; separation," it seems at once so incongruous with the system as a whole that we must inquire what foundation, if any, there is for it. The student of Heraclitus kno&gt;1vs, although the reader o; Teichmuller might not suspect, that the words xd(3apvt;, xa(3apo;, sStxpt&gt;Z siAtxpep¢ta, X@PtT°&gt;) XC')Pt(3e&gt;) dxisxroe, themselves do not occur in the authentic remains of his writings. One exception is to be noted. The word XEtCl)ptA,eSOk occurs in the passage from Stobaeus already noticed (see above, p. 584). It is as follows: ' Oxovct)&gt; Aorov: xovaa ovose; dx&gt;errat d; rouro cl)ars r&gt;0ffXtp o' °fop @ffrt d&gt;r&gt; x!xdpffy&gt;op (Stobaeus Floril. iii. 81). This passage Teichmuller uses as his text in establishing the connection of Heraclitus with the doctrine of " separation," unfortunately, however, first because he has not found the correct interpreta- tion of it, and second, because, if he had, it would stand in direct contradiction to the doctrine of imma- nence which he spends all the nest chapter in estab-</page><page sequence="40">596 PATRICE: lishing for IIeraclitus. Cosoow in this passage does not stand for the world-ruling Wisdom or Reason, or Divine Law, of which Heraclitus has so much to say in other passages. To assert the sc apartness " of that Law would be to disintegrate the entire system, the chief ?oint of which is the immanence of the Divine Law as the element of order in the shifting world. It does not follow that because ro vOsDOw is used in the above larger sense in the passage from Clement of Alexandria (Strom. v. 1A, p. 718; - frag. 65), that vOsD8&gt; cannot be used in quite the ordinary sense in the present passage. That it is so is attested by the agreement of Schuster (p. 42), Heinze (Lehre vom Logos, p. 32), Zeller (Vol I, p. 572, 1), and Pfleiderefr (p. 60). Lassalle, indeed, agrees with Teichmiiller. Schuster, following Heinze, understands the sentence to mean merely that wisdom is separated from all (men), that is, true wisdom is possessed by no one. Zeller, followed by Pfleiderer, renders it: " No one attains to this-to understand that wisdom is separated from all things, that is, h-as to go its own way inde- pendent of general opinion." Schuster's interpretation is the most natural, so that the fragment belongs among the many denunciations of the ignorance of the common people-as indeed Bywater places it-and has nothing to do with any theory of the c separateness " of an absolute or immaterial principle. Neither is there any other passage which supports this doctrine. Irl further support, however, of the C:atharsis theory in general, Teichmuller alleges the passage from Plutarch (Vit. Rom. 28), which speaks of the future purification of the soul from all bodily and earthy elements, and which Teichmuller thinks to have a strong Heraclitic colorirlg. Ia this passage iE3:eraclitus is quoted as</page><page sequence="41">597 A FURTHER STEDY OF EERACLITUS. saying that "the dry soul is the best," but beyond this fragment it is a mere conjecture that it was taken from him. The passage at any rate is unimportant. What then remains to establish any connection what- ever of Heraclitus with the " history of the idea of the stAt^pC&gt;ec ? Only the most general antithesis of fire and moisture, with the added notion that the former is the better and the latter worse. Since the divine essence of the universe itself is fire, the way upward from earth and water to fire is the diviner process, and pure fire is the noblest and highest existence. But this is shown better in the ethical sphere. The soul itself is the fiery principle (Arist. de An. i. 2, p. 40S, a, 25). " The dry soul is the wisest and best " (frag. 749. The soul of the drunken, stupid man is moist (cp. frag. 73). The highest good was to Heraclitus the clearest perception, and the clearest and most perfect percep- tion was the perception of the Universal Law of Nature, the expression of which was pure fire; and such perception was coincident with that condition of the soul when it was most like the essence of the uni- verse. This is the sum-total of the idea of the Catharsis found in Heraclitus. It is worthy of notice, to be sure, but it is not so diiEerent from what might be found in any philosophy, especially an ethical philosophy, as to make it of any great moment, either in the history of ideas or in the exposition of this system. We have studied now those parts of Teichmuller's work which, either by reason of their incompleteness or manifest error, most needed e2ramination, namely his method, his wrong conception of the Heraclitic fire, his useless and unfounded theory of the actual and potential and of the separateness of the imma- terial, and his over-emphasized doctrine of the Cathar-</page><page sequence="42">598 PATRICB: sis. Concerning the other points, it is only necessary in addition to call attention to the extreme value of his contribution in his explanations of the relation of Heraclitus to ;Kenophanes, to Anaxagoras and to Plato, of the Heraclitic Logos, of the flux, of the unity of opposites, and of the invisible harmony and the intelli- gible world defended against the sensationalism of Schuster. In the second part of his work also, though its value is less, he has contributed not a little light by his emphasis of the theological character of this philosophy, though one doubts whether his laborious collection of resemblances between the philosophy of the Ephesian and the religion of Egypt has shed much light on Heraclitus' position. It is seen at once that by taking such general conceptions as war and harmony, purification, periodicity of the world, etc., it would be easy to make a long list of parallelisms between any religion and any system of philosophy not separated farther in time and place than Heraclitus of Ephesus and the Egyptians. The resemblances, however, are certainly not all accidental, but they are such as do not affect the originality of the Ephesian, and unfor- tunately do not add much to a better knowledge of his philosophy. PPLEIDERER. Dr. Edmund Pfleiderer comes forward in a recent vol- ume of 380 pages (see above, p. 560), with an attempt to interpret the philosophy of Heraclitus from a new and independent standpoint. He expresses dissatisfac- tion with all previous results. Other critics have made the mistake of starting not from the positive but from the negative side, namely, from the universal flux (as Zeller), or from the law of opposites (as Lassalle). But the hatred of the opinions of the masses which</page><page sequence="43">599 A FURTHER STEDY OF HERACLITUS. Heraclitus exhibits, calls for some greater philosophical departure than the above negative principles, which indeed were already well known truths. Moreover, if we take these for his starting point, we can get no consistent system, for the doctrine of the universal flux does not lead naturally to the law of opposites, but rather the reverse. Again, neither the flux nor the law of opposites harmonizes with the doctrine of fire. Finally, the pessimistic, nihilistic tendency of the theory of absolute change does not agree well with the deep rationality and world-order which Heraclitus recog- nizes in all things, nor with his psychology, eschat- ology, and ethics (Pfleiderer, p. 7 f.). We must look elsewhere for his ground principle. To find it, we must discover the genesis of this philoso- phy, which did not spring into being spontaneously, like Pallas Athena from the head of her father. It could not have come from the EleaticsS for the chro- nology forbids, nor from PythagorasS whom Heraclitus reviles, nor finally from the physicists of Miletus, with whose astronomy Teichmuller has well shown our philosopher to be unacquainted. Its source is rather to be sought in the field of religion, and particularly in the Glreek Mysteries. In the light of the Orphico- Dionysiac Mysteries, in a word, according to Pfleid- erer, this philosophy is to be interpreted. IIere is the long-sought key. The nzystic holds it, as indeed Dio- genes Laertius says: TaXVc 'ffpaXiCETOV @Z ay9aRow rs'ArC :e'320&gt; rovsveov ydia roe 8uvRaroc Arpayreros. bpswD&gt;7y xae AXOTOc 4ATtS dAdywrsow * (&gt; 8e sz #svTas eevar4p7} soaS¢pou A(X,7TPOT6P ^z£A!OV.- iX. 16. With the religion of the Mysteries, in its older and purer form, Heraclitus was in full sympathy. By his</page><page sequence="44">600 P A TRICK: family he was brought into close connection with it. Ephesus, too, his city, was a religious centre. Dio- genes (ix. 6) relates that he deposited his book in the temple of Artemis. Heraclitus, indeed, was not a friend of the popular religion, but that was because of its abuses, and it was in particular the popular Olym- pian religion that he attacked. The connection of the Ephesian with the Mysteries may be considered as a deep-seated influence which their underlying princi- ples exerted upon him. These religious principles he turned into metaphysics. His system as a whole was religious and metaphysical (Pfleiderer, p. 32 f.). With this introduction, Pfleiderer proceeds as fol- lows. Heraclitus' starting point lay positively in his theory of knowledge, which was a doctrine of specu- lative intuition and self-absorption. In this sense our author understands the fragment from Plutarch (adv. Colot. 20, p. 1118;-frag. 80), 'EdeCvsf,tl&gt; @#s@VTOS, ;; I searched within myself," that is, I wrapped myself in thought, and so in this self-absorption I sought the kernel of all truth. Hence his contempt for the masses who act and speak without insight. But does not this conflict with those Heraclitic sentences which place the standard of truth and action in the common or universal (vpow) ? (cp. frags. 92, 91). Do these not lead as Schuster holds, to the rule, Verum est, quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus credituzn est ? No, says Pfleiderer, the common here does not mean the general opinion of the majority. All such interpret- ations are sufficiently refuted by that other passage, " To me, one is ten thousand if he be the best " (frag. 113). What Heraclitus really meant by the common (¢vpow) was " the true inward universality. " Absorp- tion into one's inner self was absorption into that</page><page sequence="45">601 A XTYBf1fUD CI tTTs A1; rhD A Pt smrra r v-ss IasUul Vn Xa=wssuc ground of reason which is identical with the divine principle of the world. By this universal reason under which he contemplated all things, lIeraclitus meant nothing different from what by Spinoza was expressed by "sub specie aeternitatis," and in subsequent phi- losophy by " intellectual intuition " and " the stand- point of universal knowledge." lIeraclitus fell back upon that universal instinct which in the form of human language is exhibited as the deposit of succes- sive ages, and which again he did not distinguish from the voice of the Sibyl, representative of divine revelation. As respects the source of knowledge, Heraclitus as little as Spinoza, Fichte and Hegel, looked to himself as individual, but rather to that singular and qualitative divine source in which the individual participates (Pfleiderer, p. 46 ff.). The senses, though they do not give us the whole truth, yet furnish the sufficient data that are to be interpreted by the light of reason. The errors of the masses do not arise from trusting the senses, for the latter give not a false, but a partial account. Their error lies in missing the spiritual band which unites the manifold of sense into the higher unity, an error distinctive of the popular polytheism as against the religion of the Mysteries (Id. p. 70). The theory of knowledge, lIeraclitus' starting point, being thus disposed of, Pfleiderer proceeds to discuss the material principles of his philosophy in their abstract metaphysical form. The keynote here is the indestrt6ctibility of ltfe. The oscillating identity of life and death, a truth adopted from the Mysteries, is taken up by lIeraclitus and elevated into a universal and metaphysical principle. It is based on the simple observation of Wature, which sees the life and light</page><page sequence="46">602 PATRICK: and warmth of summer passing into the death and darkness and cold of winter, only to be revived and restored in the never-failing spring. So on a smaller scale, day passes into night, but night ever again into day. So everywhere in Nature nothing passes away but to revive again. From this follows the hope of the universality of this law, the indestructibility of human life, and the resolution of the opposition be- tween the light, warm life here above and the dark, cold death below. This is the hopeful element which characterizes the philosophy of the Ephesian. Over against it was the hopeless creed of the masses, whose complaint over the inexorable destiny of death found expression from the earliest times in the despairing lines of the poets. The common view does not see too much continuanca and constancy in reality, but too little. " What we see waking,?' says Heraclitus, " is death, what we see sleeping is a dream " (Clement of Alex. iii. 3, p. 520; =frag. 64). Which means, that like the unreality and inconstaney of dreams is this ephem- eral and perishing existence which we, the vulgar people, see when awake. Reversing this gloomy viewf the DIysteries taught that Hades and Dionysus were the same (cp. frag. 127). That is, the god of death feared in the world below, is identical with the god of life and joy of the world here above, which is to say that the regenerative power of life persists even in death and shall overcome it (Pfleiderer, p. 74 fE.). From this theory of the indestructibility of the fire force of life, Heraclitus passes to the ancillary truth of the unity of opposition in general. Hence he asserted the identity of day and night, winter and summer, young and old, sleeping and waking, hunger and satiety (cp. frags. 36, 78). His whole theory of the</page><page sequence="47">603 A FURTEER #TUDY OF EERAtITE#. harmony of opposites was, as it were, apologetic. If life rules in death, why does death exist ? It was in answer to this question that Heraclitus developed his science of opposition and strife, by showing the pres- ence here of a general law (Pfleiderer, p. 84 fE.). In the same spirit Pfleiderer interprets the much contested figure of the harmony of the world as the harmony of the bow and the lyre (see frags. 4S, 56). Without rejecting the interpretation suggested by Bernays (Rhein. Mus. vii. p. 94) and followed by most other critics, which refers the figure to the form of the bow and of the lyre, their opposite stretching arms producing harmony by tension, Pfleiderer finds in the comparison still another meaning. The bow and the lyre are both attributes of Apollo, the slayer and the giver of life and joy. Thus the harmony between the bow and the lyre, as attributes of one god-symbols respectively of death and of life and joy expresses the great thought of the harmony and reciprocal inter- change of death and life (Pfleiderer, p. 89 fE.). The El:eraclitic flux of all things, says Pfleiderer, was not antecedent to his abstract teachings, but the logi- cal consequence thereof. The identity of life and death led him to the identity of all opposites. But opposites are endlessly flowing or passing into each other. Hence from the principle that everything is opposition, follows the principle that everything flows. The universal flux is ouly a pcture to make his relig- ious metaphysical sentences intelligible (Id. p. lOG ff.). The Heraclitic fire is real fire as opposed to the logical symbol of Lassalle, but not the strictly sensible fire that burns and crackles, as Teichmuller supposes. It is rather a less definite conception, which is taken now as fire, now as warmth, warm air or vapor. It is</page><page sequence="48">604 PATRICE: the concrete form or intuitional correlate of the meta- physical notion of life (Id. p. 120 fE.). " The way up and down " refers not only to the trans- mutations of fire, water, and earth, but holds good in general for the oscillation of opposites, and particularly for the polarity of life and death (Id. p. 140). As one result of his investigation, Pfleiderer affirms a strong optimistic element in the philosophy of the Ephesian. He contests the opinion of Schuster and Zeller that the endless destruction of single existences is kindred to the pessimistic doctrine of Anaximander, of the extinction of all individuals as an atonement for the " injustice " of individual existence. The pro- cess indeed goes on, but it has a bright side, and it is this that Heraclitus sees. Life, to be sure, is ever pass- ing into death, but out of death life ever emerges. It is this thought, the powerlessness of death over the indestructible fire force of life, which Heraclitus em- phasizes (Id. p. 180 S. ). Still more decided is his rational optimism, his un- swerving belief in a world well ordered and disposed. A deep rationality characterizes the universe (cp. frags. 2,1, 91, 92, 98, 99, 96,19). To express this idea, Hera- clitus used the word Logos, which after his time played so prominent a part in the older philosophy. This word, passing even beyond its signification of " well ordered relation," conveyed finally with Heraclitus, as Aoro; tvpo:, rather the idea of Reason immanent in the world (Pfleiderer, p. 231 fE.). In the invisible harmony we find the same general thought. As distinguished from the visible harmony, which meant that external order of Wature insuring to the trustful peasant the never failing return of summer and winter, heat and frost, day and night, the invisi-</page><page sequence="49">aos A FURTHER #TEDY OF HEPACLTTE#. ble harmony was that all-embracing harmony which is revealed to thought as the rational union of all oppositions. Against this theodicy there is no valid objection to be derived from the accounts which repre- sent the Ephesian philosopher as sad and complain- ing, nor from the passages descriptive of the evils of life and the weakness of men (cp. frags. 86, 5S, 112, etc.). In all cases these refer not to the philosopher's own opinions, but to the errors of the ignorant masses (Pfleiderer, p. 23o ff.). The future existence of the soul, though not consis- tent with his physics and metaphysies, was neverthe- less held from the religious and ethical standpoint. In fact it was involved, as has been shown, in Heraclitus point of departure, so that we have less reason to com- plain of inconsistency in his case than we have, in reference to the same matter, in the caLse of the Stoics later (Id. p. 210). We have given, perhaps, more space to the exposi- tion of Pfleiderer's work than it relatively deserves, because it is the last word that has been spoken on Heraclitus, because, also, it has deservedly brought into prOminenGe the optimism and the religious char- acter of his philosophy, and because finally it presents another instructive example of over-systemization. It claims our attention, too, because the view it proposes is a complete reversal of the prevalent conception of Heraclitus, and if seriously taken, changes the whole tenor of his philosophy. In what follows we shall e2amine chiefly the two main points in Pfleiderer's work, :namely, the theory of knowledge and the connection with the G#reek Mysteries; the latter, because it is Pfleiderer's particu-</page><page sequence="50">606 PATRIC1r: lar contriblltion, and the former, because it will open to us an important aspect of the Ephesian's philosophy. In the first place, however, it can by no means be admitted that the doctrine of the flus and the harmony of opposites represent the negative side of his system, and are secondary to his theory of knowledge and his religious dogmas. The unanimous testimony of the ancients cannot be thus easily set aside. That of Plato and Aristotle alone is decisive. Pfleiderer objects that Plato's purpose, which was to establish the changelessness of noumena against the change of phenomena, led him to emphasize the flux of Hera- clitus. But if Heraclitus' positive teachings were, as Pfleiderer says, first of all the theory of knowledge, this and not the flux must have been emphasized in the Theaetetus where the theory of knowledge was Plato's theme. It is sufficient, however, here to note that what Heraclitus has stood for in philosophy from his own time to the present, is the doctrine of absolute change, and this doctrine may, therefore, properly be called the positive side of his philosophy. If what Pfleiderer means is that the theory of knowledge and not the flllx was his starting point, he would have a shadow more of right. It is, however, misleading to say that his theory of knowledge was his starting point, for, as we have indicated in our examination of Schuster's work, Heraclitus was not concerned with a theory of knowledge as such. To state in a word what his point of departure really was, regarded from a common-sense view, it was his conviction that he was in possession of new truth which the blindness and ignorance of men prevented them from seeing (the point of departure indeed of almost every one who writes a book), and the three leading ideas in this</page><page sequence="51">607 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITES. new truth were: 1. the absence of that stability in Wature which the untrained senses perceive; 2. the unsuspected presence of a universal law of order; 3. the law of strife which brings unity out of diversity. In one sen. se this may be called a theory of knowledge, and only in this sense was it his starting point. But concerning the theory of knowledge itself, we cannot accept Pfieiderer's position. By placing it in speculative intuition and self-absorption, he has rushed to the very opposite e2rtreme of Schuster's sensation- alism, and in so doing has equally misrepresented Heraclitus. Either extreme is forcing a modern theory of knowledge upon the Ephesian of which he was wholly innocent. What support has Pfleiderer for his "self-absorption" theory ? None whatever. iEe alleges the fragment 'EdzZuqvd,u&gt; @#¢@VTOS (cp. frag. 80), which he arbitrarily renders, " I searched within myself " (" Ich forschte in mir selbst "). This frag- ment is from Plutarch (adv. Colot. 20, p. 1118), Diog- enes Laertius (is:. 5; cp. frag. 80, sources), and others. Plutarch understands it to refer simply to self-knowl- edge like the r&gt;@at xtaurov at Delphi (similarly Julian, Or. vi. p. 185 A). Diogenes understands it as referring to self-instruction (similarly Tatian, Or. ad GEraec. 3). Diogenes says, " He (Heraclitus) was a pupil of no one, but he said that he inquired for himself and learned all things by himself" (xovas r' ov8Swocn dAA' airow ef7y dzO7'aasttac xae yad£cp rdpra rap @VfOU). The latter seems to be its true meaning, as is seen by comparing the passage from Polybius (xii. 27; cp. frag. 15), " The eyes are better witnesses than the ears." As here he means to say that men should see for themselves and not trust to the reports of others, so in the fragmerlt in question he means only that he himself has inquired of</page><page sequence="52">608 PATRICE: himself and not of others (cp. also frags. 14, 13). But Pfleiderer, in order to support a theory, has taken these two innocent words and pressed them into a doc- trine of contemplative intuition, by giving them the meaning, " I wrapped myself in thought " (" Ich ver- senkte mich sinnend und forschend," etc., p. 47). So far is it from the case that lIeraclitus sought the source of knowledge by turning inward, that he ex- pressed himself directly to the contrary. Thus we read in Plutarch (de Superst. 3, p. 166; =frag. 95): o'Hpa- Xi¢tTOu f§at, TOc5 arPCropotp ppa xa xozvov XOS/10&gt; sNat, rov 8&amp; XOt#hU#s&gt;(ok exaarov ¢vs 'ozov droarpessdat, the sense of which is well given by Campbell (Theaetetus of Plato, p. 246), " To live in the light of the universal Order is to be awake, to turn aside into our own microcosm is to go to sleep. " Again, the whole passage from Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math. vii. 132, 133; cp. frags. 92, 2) is conclusive. " For," says Sextus, " having thus statedly shown that we do and think everything by participation in the divine reason, he [Heraclitus] adds, 'It is necessary therefore to follow the com- mon, for although the Law of Reason is common, the majority of people live as though they had an under- standing of their own.' But this is nothing else than an explanation of the mode of the universal disposition of things. As far therefore as we participate in the memory of this, we are true, but as far as we separate ourselves tndtvtdually we are false. A more express denial of any self-absorption or a prtorz theory of knowledge would be impossible. Heraclitus is con- stantly urging men to come out of themselves and place themselves in an attitude of recepttvtty to that which surrounds them, and not go about as if self- included (cp. frags. 94, 3, 2). But what does Hera-</page><page sequence="53">609 A FU1lTHER STIJDY OF HE1DACLITUS. clitus mean by participation in the divine or universal Reason ? Is not this just Pfleiderer's position when he says that the Ephesian as little as Fichte or Hegel looked to himself as individual, but rather to that abso- lute reason in which the individual participates ? The diference is radical and vital, but Pfleiderer, like Lassalle, failed to see it because he did not free himself from strictly modern theories of knowledge. The dif- ference is simply this. The universal reaso:a of which Pfleiderer is speaking is that in which man necessartly and by hts tntellectucll nature participates. That of Heraclitus is the divine Reason, in which man ought to participate but may not. Pfleiderer's universal reason is universal tn man. That of Heraclitus, out- side of and independent of man. The latter, so far from being necessarily involved in thought, is inde- pendent of thought. It is that pure, fiery and godlike essence, the apprehension of which gives rationality in the measure in which it is possessed. No reader, therefore, who can think of only two theories of knowledge, a strictly a prtort theory and a strictly empirical theory, can understand Heraclitus. But, it may be asked, if knowledge does not come from with- out through the senses, nor from within from the nature of thought, whence does it come ? IIeraclitus, however, would not be disturbed by such a modern dilemma. There is reason, in fact, to believe, though it sounds strange to us, that he supposed this divine rational essence to be inhaled in the air we breathe (cp. Sextus Emp. adv. Math. vii. 127, 132). It exists in that which surrounds us (Z6peexov), and the measure of our rationality depends on the degree in which we can possess ourselves of this divine flame. There was no conciseness of thought here, however, and lIeracli-</page><page sequence="54">610 PATRICK: tus seemed to thillk that it was partly apprehended through the senses, that is, the most perfect condition of receptivity to truth was the condition in which a man was most awake. The stupidest man is he who is asleep, blind, self-involved, and we may add, self- absorbed (cp. frags. 9S, 90, 77, 3, 2, 94). Hence, if we have rightly interpreted Heraclitus here, a man might wrap himself in thought forever and be no nearer to truth. The source of knowledge did not lie in that direction to any pre-Socratic Glreek philosopher. Absorption into one's inner self, which Pfleiderer thinks was Heraclitus' source of absolute knowledge, was the one thing he most despised. Let us now consider the connection of Heraclitus with the Glreek Mysteries, which Pfleiderer makes the basis of his interpretation of the whole philosophy. Pfleiderer has done a good work in emphasizing the religious character of the philosophyof theEphesian. Lassalle and Teichmuller had already pointed it out. Failure to recognize this is the gravest fault in the critical work of Zeller. But as in Lassalle we found over-systemization of the logical idea, in Schuster of the empirical, in Teichmuller of the physical, so in Pflei- derer there is great over-systemization of the religi- ous element. More strictly, it is a vast over-emphasis of one thought, namely, the indestructibility of life, or the alternating identity of life and death, which Pflei- derer claims to be a religious truth taken from the Mysteries, and out of which, as we have seen, he spins the whole philosophy of IIeraclitus, including the doctrine of the eternal flux, the unity of opposites, and the fire. The slight grounds on which all this is based must have already impressed the reader with surprise that Pfleiderer should make so much out</page><page sequence="55">611 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. of it. The fact that Heraclitus lived in Ephesus and that Ephesus was a very religious city, is a fair speci- men of the arguments by which he would establish a conllection with the Mysteries. There have been pre- served only three fragments in which Heraclitus makes any direct reference to the (;reek Mysteries, all taken from (:lement of Alexandria (Protrept. 2, pp. 19, 30; cp. frags. 124, 12S, 127), and in these three passages other critics have found no sympathy with, but stern condemnation of the mystic cult. In the first passage where the PVXTtUO2iOtx drot, &amp;Z°t A&gt;ae and yuaTae are threatened with future fire, Pfleiderer admits con- demnation of mystic abuses. But the third fragment, relating to the Dionysiac orgies, is the one upon which he most relies to establish the sympathy of our philo- sopher with the Mysteries. The passage is as follows: Ee , rceP atO&gt;9ff 0/&gt;ff§&gt; @FOtRD&gt;TO xae vy&gt;row aya as30soez, &amp;&gt;az8eaTaTa ;7p^aaT avs FVTOf 8R' 'Ac3a: xat 3tO&gt;DAOf OaT;t yaspovrae xae A&gt;asCovz. " For were it not Dionysus to whom they institute a procession and sing songs in honor of the pudenda, it would be the most shameful action. But Dionysus, in whose honor they rave in bacchic frenzy, and Hades, are the same. " Although this has usually been interpreted (by Schlei- ermacher, Lassalle, and Schuster) to mean that the excesses practiced in these ceremonieswill beatonedfor hereafter, since Dionysus under whose name they are carried on is identical with Pluto, the god of the lower world, Pfleiderer, interpreting it in a wholly different spirit, believes it to mean that these rites, although in themselves considered they would be most shameful, nevertheless have at least a partial justification from the fact that they are celebrated in honor of Dionysus, because since Dionysus and Pluto are the same, the</page><page sequence="56">612 PATRICl: rites are really a symholism expressing the power of life over death and the indestructibility of life even in death. These vile phallus songs are in fact songs of triumph of life over death (Pfleiderer, p. 28). Although somewhat far-fetched, this is a possible in- terpretation of this obscure passage. This explanation is perhaps not more strained than the others that have been given (see below, frag. 12T, crit. note). Granting it, and granting that Heraclitus here expresses a cer- tain sympathy with, or at least does not express condemnation of the Mysteries, what follows ? Surely, Pfleiderer would not seriously ask us to conclude from a single passage friendly to the religion of the Myste- ries, that IIeraclitus' whole philosophy or any part of it was drawn from them. But this fragment has another and more important use for Pfleiderer. In the religious truth here expressed of the identity of Dionysus and Hades, that is, the identity of life and death, he finds the germ of all the Heraclitic philosophy. But the serious question immediately arises whether the philosophy of oppo- sites grew out of this identity, or whether this identity was merely another illustration of the law of oppo- sites. As Pfleiderer has produced no sufficient reason for believing differently, the natural conclusion is that, as elsewhere we find the unity of day and night, up and down, awake and asleep, so here we have the unity of the god of death and the god of life, as another illustration of the general law. To reverse this and say that in this particular antithesis we have the parent of all antitlleses is very fanciful. Still further, we should infer from Pfleiderer's argument that the identity of Dionysus and Hades was a well known and accepted truth among the Mysteries, and that in the</page><page sequence="57">613 A FURTHER STEDY OF HERACLITUS. above fragment we find it in the very act of passing into the philosophy of the Ephesian. How much truth is there in this ? So little that there is no record of the identity of these two gods before the time of Hera- clitus. Later, to be sure, something of the kind ap- pears. Dionysus represented at least five different gods, and in different times and places seems to have been identified with most of the principal deities. In Crete and at Delphi we hear of Zagreus, the winter Dionysus of the lower world. iN o doubt other instances might be shown where Dionysus was brought into some relatiorL or other with a chthonian deity. But Heraclitus, if he had wished to develop a philosophy from the alternation of summer and winter and the mystic symbolism of life and death therein contained, would hardly have chosen so dubious all expression of it as the urLity of Dionysus and IIades. We have no reason to regard this as anything else than one of the many paradoxical statements which he loved, of his law of opposites. Indeed, the genesis of this law is not so obscure that we need to force it out of a hidden mystic symbolism. Zeller in his introduction to (;reek philosophy has well said that philosophy did not need the myth of Kore and Demeter to make known the alternation of natural conditions, the passage from death to life and life to death; daily observation taught it"(Vol.1,.60). The intrinsic weakness of Pfleiderer's position is best seen when he attempts to pass to the doctrine of the flux. It taxes the imagination to see how the identity of life and death should le.ad to the universal principle rd&gt;ra tco,osc xat ov3sw #s&gt;£t. Pfleiderer would have us believe that the eternal flux was a subordinate thought-a mere picture to help the mind to conceive</page><page sequence="58">614 PATRICE: the primary metaphysical truth of the unity of oppo- sites. We have already attempted to show that any explanation of the Heraclitic philosophy must be wrong which reduces the doctrine of the flux to a subordinate position. Here it is sufficient to add that if Heraclitus had been seeking a picture to illustrate the optimistic endurance of life even in death, and the rational unity and harmony of opposite powers, he could not possibly have chosen a more unfortunate figure than the ever- flowing river into which one cannot step twice. Pflei- derer, in saying that Heraclitus chose the picture of the evanescence of things to illustrate his law of opposites and the endurance of life, seems to have forgotten that on a previous page (above, p. 602) he said that the hopeless creed of the masses, against which the Ephe- sian was trying to establish the triumph of life, saw not too much permanence and constancy in the world, but too little. We are forced, therefore, to conclude not only that Pfleiderer has failed to establish any especial depend- ence of IIeraclitus upon the religion of the Greek Mys- teries, but also that h.is supposed discovery that we have here a metaphysical philosophy developed from the material principle of the oscillating identity of life and death, is an assumption without basis in fact. In redeeming the Ephesian from the charge of pessi- mism, Pfleiderer has done a good work. But here again he has gone too far, in finding not only a well grounded rational optimism in the doctrine of a world- ruling Order, but also a practical optimism in the idea of the indestructibility of life, an idea which, although it appears on every page of Pfleiderer's book, is not to be found in any saying of Heraclitus or in any record of his philosophy.</page><page sequence="59">615 A FURTHER STUDY OF EERACLITUS. SEaTIoN II. REaoNsTRuaTIvE. I. Having examined the four preceding fundamentally different views of the philosophy of Heraclitus, and having discovered that the opinions of modern critics on the tenor of this philosophy furnish a new and un- expected illustration of Heraclitus' own law of abso- lute instability, it remains to be considered wllether it is possible to resolve, as he did, this general diversity into a higher unity, and in this case to verify his law that in a11 opposition there is harmony. If such a unity is sought as that attempted by Lassalle, Schuster and Pfleiderer, it may be said at once that the task is impossible. All such ambitious attempts in construc- tive criticism in the case of Heraclitus are certain to result, as we have seen in over-interpretation, and while they may leave a completed picture in the mind of the reader, they do not leave a true one. Not only is such a unified view of the philosophy of the Ephe- sian unattainable, but it is unnecessary. It is quite certain that had we before us his original book in its entirety, ave should find therein no fully consistent system of philosophy. Yet it is just this fact that modern critics forget. While they point out errors and contradictions by the score in the books of their fellow critics, they allow for ncs inconsistencies on the part of the original philosopher. Presuppositions of harmony between all the sentences of an ancient writer have led to much violence of interpretation. Our interest in Heraclitus is not in his system as such, but in his great thoughts which have historic signifi- cance. These we should know, if possible, in their</page><page sequence="60">616 PATRICE: original meaning and in their connection with preced- ing and succeeding philosophy. Before concluding this introduction, then, it will be of advantage to re- capitulate the results of the foregoing criticism, and to place together such conclusions concerning the chief Heraclitic thoughts as we have drawn either from the agreement or the disagreement of the various critics. We shall loest understand Heraclitus if we fix well in mind his immediate starting-point. As we found above in the examination of Pfleiderer's position (p. 606), the Ephesian philosopher was first and primarily a preacher. To him the people almost without excep- tion, were blind, stupid, and beastly. Heraclitus hated them. They got no farther than crude sense perception (cp. frags. 4, 6, 3), failing not only to recog- nize the invisible harmony of the changing world, but even the change itself (cp. frag. 2). They believed things were fixed because they appeared so at first sight. They preferred the lower passions to the higher senses (cp. frag. 111). He is from first to last a misan- thrope. lIe despises the people, yet as if constrained by a divine command, he must deliver his message (cp. frags. 1, 2). To understand lIeraclitus we must free our minds from conceptions of every other (}reek philoso- pher, except, perhaps, his fel]ow Ionians. Never after- wards did philosophy exhibit such seriousness. We can no more imagine lIeraclitus at Athens than we call think of Socrates away from it. Although, as we shall see, the philosophy of Plato stood in vital con- nection with that of Heraclitus, no contrast could be greater than the half playful speculative style of the former, and the stern, oracular and dogmatic utter- ances of the latter. We shall find no parallel except in Jewish literature. Indeed, lIeraclitus was a pro-</page><page sequence="61">617 A FlrRTHER STEDY OF HERACLITUS. phet. As the prophets of Israel hurled their messages in actual defiance at the people, hardly more does the Ephesian seem to care how his words are received, if only he gets them spoken. STot more bitter and mis- anthropic is Hosea in his denunciation of the people's sins (cp. ch. iv. 1, 2 fE.), than is our philosopher in his corltempt for the stupidity and dullness of the masses. At the very opening of his book he says, from his lofty position of conscious superiority: " This Law which I unfold, men insensible and half asleep will not hear, and hearing, will not comprehend " (frag. 2; cp. frags. 3, 5, 94, 95). Now what was the prime error of the people which so aroused the Ephesian, and what was the message which he had to deliver to them ? Zeller is wrong in saying (Vol. 1, p. 576) that, according to Heraclitus, the radical error of the people was in attributing to things a permanence of being which they did not possess. In no passage does he censure the people for this. What he blames them for is their insenstbtltty, for looking low when they ought to look high in a word, for blindness to the Divine Law or the Universal Reason (frags. 2, 3, 4, 51, 4S, 14). He blames them for not recognizing the beauty of strife (frag. 43), and the law of opposites (frag. 45). He blames them for their grossness and beastliness (frags. 86, 111). Finally, he blames them for their immorality (frag. 124), their silliness in praying to idols (frag. 126), and their imbecility in thinking they could purify themselves by sacrifices of blood (frag. 130). We see therefore how wholly impossible it is to under- stand Heraclitus unless we consider the ethical and religious character of his mind. Thus Zeller, in as far as he has attempted to give us a picture of Heraclitus'</page><page sequence="62">618 PATRICE: system, has failed by starting with the doctrine of the flu2r and overlooking the religious motive. This is not to say, as Pfleiderer has done that the flux was merely a negative teaching. Next to the recognition of the Eternal Law, it was the most positive of his teachings, and was the ground of his influence upon subsequent thought. As such it is of chief interest to us; but as far as we wish to get a picture of Heraclitus himself, we must think first of his religious and ethical point of departure. Thus the content of Heraclitus' message to his countrymen was ethical. It was a call to men everywhere to wake up, to purify their ,Sapdpous 0uXds and see things in their reality. What now was this reality which he with his finer insight saw, but which ruder souls were blind to? This brings us to the theoretical side or the philo- sophical content of Heraclitus' message. Here comes in the contribution of TeichmuIler, who, as we saw, clearly pointed out that the great new thought of the Ephesian was the unity in the manifold, as opposed to the unity over against the manifold, taught by Xenophanes. It was the unity of opposition, the harmony of strife. It was Order immanent in cease- less change. To use a phrase of Campbell's, " The Idea of the universe implies at once absolute activity and perfect law" (Plat. Theaet. Appendi2r, p. 244). This was the central thought of Heraclitus, i' the grandeur of which," says Campbell, " was far beyond the com- prehension of that time." But, it may be said, if we have rightly apprehended Heraclitus' position as a prophet and preacher, this was rather strong meat to feed the Inasses. But the 7roRi0e with Heraclitus was a very broad term. It included everybody. The arro- gance of this man was sublime. STeither Homer nor</page><page sequence="63">619 A VTTzDttTB^D a-T\ X TYtO A {1T Ttl*Ttwd n UX^lDSl ^U^JS VW al&gt;\JsJll UPe Eesiod nor Pythagoras nor :x:enophanes escaped his lash (cp. frags. 16, 1T, 119, 114). He had especially in mind the so-called " men of repute," and said they were makers and witnesses of lies (cp. frag. 118). The whole male population of Ephesus, he said, ought to be hung or expelled on account of their infatuation and blindness (cp. frag. 114). Addressing such an audience, indeed, his message had to be pitched high. We have in the Ephesian sage a man who openly claimed to have an insight superior to all the world, and the history of thought has vindicated his claim. Furthermore, it must be remembered that Heraclitus did, in a measure, try to make the world-ruling Law intelligible. He pictured it now as Justice, whose handmaids, the Erinyes, will not let the sun overstep his bounds (frag. 29); now as Fate, or the all-determin- ing Destiny (Stobaeus, Ecl. i. 5, p. 178; cp. frag. 63); now as simple Law (frags. 23, 91), now as Wisdom (frag. 65), intelligent Will (frag. 19), God (frag. 36), Zeus (frag. 65). Respecting the latter term he e2r- pressly adds that it is misleading. So we see that Heraclitus did what some modern philosophers have been blamed for doing he put his new thoughts into old religious formulas. But it was more justifiable in the case of the Ephesian. He did so, not to present a semblance of orthodo2ry, but to try to make his idea intelligible. In fact, Heraclitus, no less than :X:eno- phanes, was a fearless, outspoken enemy of the popular anthropornorphisms. " This world, the sarne for all," he says, " neither any of the gods nor any man has made, but it always was, and is, and shall be, an ever living fire, kindled and quenched according to law " (frag. 20; Gp. frag. 126). At this point it is natural to ask ourselves what,</page><page sequence="64">620 PATRICE: more e2ractly considered, Heraclitus meant by his Uni- versal Order, his Divine Law, xotwo5 Aoro5, etc. This inquiry fair criticism will probably not allow us to answer more concisely than has already been done. We have found ample reason for rejecting the notion that it was of a logical nature, or any objectification of that which is inherent in human thought. Yet it was not without human attributes. As fiery essence, it was identified with the universe and became almost material. As Order, it approached the idea of pure mathematical Relation or Form (cp. frag. 23, and Zel- ler, Vol. 1, p. 628, 3, and 620). As Wisdom, it was pic- tured as the intelligent power or efficient force that produces the Order. When we reflect what difflculty even at the present day we find in answering the simple question, What is Order ? we are less surprised to find that the Ephesian philosopher did not always distinguish it from less difflcult conceptions. We are, however, surprised and startled at the significance of the thought which this early G#reek so nearly formu- lated, that the one permanent, abiding element in a universe of ceaseless change is mathematical relation. At any rate, while recognizing the want of perfect consistency and coordinatiou in Heraclitus' system here, we shall be helped by keeping this in mind, that the system was pure pantheism. Too much stress can- not be laid upon Teichmuller's e2rposition of the history of the idea of Transcendent Reason, which first arose, not in Heraclitus, but in Ana2ragoras. To the latter belongs the credit or the blame, whichever it may be, of taking the first step towards the doctrine of imma- teriality or pure spirit, which has influenced not only philosophy, but society to its foundations even to the present day. Heraclitus was guiltless of it. To</page><page sequence="65">621 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERSCLITUS. him the world intelligence itself was a part of the world material itself took part in the universal change. In close connection with the Heraclitic Universal Order stands the doctrine of strife as the method of the evolution of the world, and the doctrine of the har- mony and ultimately the unity of opposites thoughts which were not only central in Heraclitus' system, but which, being too advanced for his time, have waited to be taken up in no small degree by modern science. It is unnecessary to repeat here the explana- tions of Schuster (above, pp. 574, 575), and particularly of Teichmuller (above, p. 586), which we found to indi- cate the correct interpretation of these thoughts. These principles are to Heraclitus the mediation between absolute change and perfect law. That which appears. to the senses as rest and stability is merely the tempo- rary equilibrium of opposite striving forces. It is har- mony by tension (cp. frags. 4S, 43, 46). This law, elementary in modern physics, is yet, as we shall pres- ently see, not the whole content of the Heraclitic thought, although it is its chief import. But in the equilibrium of opposite forces we have at least relative rest, not motion. And of molecular motion Heraclitus knew nothing. How then did he conceive of appaxent stability as absolute motion ? This question supposes more exactness of thought than we look fo in the Ephesian. The eternal flu2r was more generally con- ceived as absolute perishability. Nothing is perma- nently fised. All is involved in the ceaseless round of life and death, growth and decay. Strictly, however, there is no contradiction here, since the rest of balanced forces is only relative rest. It is possibly not going too far to accept an illustration given by Ernst Laas (Idealismus u. Positivismus 1, p. 200) of Heraclitus'</page><page sequence="66">622 PATRICK: conception of absolute change under the dominion of law. He compares it to the actual path of our planets, which move neither in circles nor in e2ract ellipses, but under the influence of the attractive forces of moons and of other planets, or of comets, continually change both their course and their velocity, and yet all accord- ing to law. In addition to the explanations now given, how- ever, there is something more to be said concerning the unity or sameness of opposites. This teaching is very prominent in the Heraclitic fragments (cp. frags. 3S, 36, 39, 43, 4S, 46, 52, 57, 58, 59, 67, 78). This prominence was no doubt less in the original work, as the parado2rical character of these sayings has encour- aged their preservation. But all the critics have failed to notice that we have in these fragments two distinct classes of oppositions which, though confused in Hera- clitus' mind, led historically into diSerent paths of development. The first is that unity of opposites which results from the fact that they are endlessly passing into one another. It must not be forgotten that this is a purely physical opposition, as has been pointed out by Zeller, Schuster and others, in refuta- ftion of the opinion of Lassalle, who fancied that he had found here a Hegelian logical identity of contra- dictories. As examples of this class of oppositions may be mentioned the identity of day and night (frag. 35), gods and men (frag. 67), alive and dead, asleep and awake (frag. 78). The identity of these oppositions means that they are not in themselves abiding condi- tions, but are continually and reciprocally passing into one another. As lIeraclitus plainly says, they are the same because they are reciprocal transmutations of each other (frag. 78). But now we have another</page><page sequence="67">623 A FURTHER STUDY OF EERACLITUS. class of opposites to which this reasoning will not apply. "Good and evil," he says, " are the same " (frag. 57). This is simply that identity of opposites which developed into the Protagorean doctrine of relattvity. The same thing may be good or evil according to the side from which you look at it. The passage from H;ppolytus (Ref. haer. is. 10; cp. frag. 52, sources) states the doctrine of relativity as plainly as it can be stated. " Pure and impure, he [Heraclitus] says, are one and the same, and drinkable and undrink- able are one and the same. ' Sea water,' he says, ' is very pure and very foul, for while to fishes it is drink- able and healthful, to men it is hurtful and unfit to drink.' " (Compare the opposition of just and unjust, frag. 61; young and old, frag. 78; beauty and ugli- ness, frag. 99; cp. frags. 104, 98, 60, 61, 51, 53.) This simple truth is so prominent in the Heraclitic sayings that we see how Schuster could have mistaken it for the whole content of the theory of opposites and ig- nored the more important doctrine of the other class. We see further that Plato's incorrect supposition that the Protagorean subjectivism was wholly an outgrowth of the Heraclitic flux, resulted from his insufficient acquaintance with the Ephesian's own writings. It was a characteristic of Heraclitus that, in a degree surpassing any other philosopher of antiquity, and comparable only to the discoveries of GEreek mathema- ticians and of modern physical philosophers, he had an insight into truths beyond his contemporaries, but he knew not how to coordinate or use them. Having hit upon certain parado2rical relations of opposites, he hastened to group under his new law all sorts of oppo- sitions. Some that cannot be included under either of the above classes appear in a passage from Aristotle</page><page sequence="68">624 PATRICE: (de Mundo, 5, p. 396 b 12; cp. frag. 59, sources; cp. Eth. Eud. vii. 1, p. 1235 a 26; frag. 43), where in the case of the opposites sharps and flats, male and female, the opposition becomes simple correlation and the unity, harmony. The order of treatment brings us now to the Hera- clitic flux, but we have been compelled so far to anti- cipate this in discussing the Universal Order and the Law of Opposites that but one or two points need be considered here. As we have seen in the study of Schuster and Teichmuller, the Heraclitic doctrine of the flus was a thoroughly radical one. Heaven and earth and all that they contain were caught in its fatal whirlpool. It exempted no immortal gods of the poets above us, no unchangeable realm of Platonic ideas around us, no fi2red Aristotelian earth beneath us. It banished all permanence from the universe, and banished therewith all those last supports which men are accustomed to cling to. It introduced alarm into philosophy, and set men, even to the present day, asking, What can be saved from this general wreck ? What is there absolutely permanent in the universe ? This question, as we have seen, did not trouble Hera- clitus hilnself, for, consistently or inconsistently, he had a foundation rock in his Universal Law, Reason or Order, which was his theoretical starting-point. Furthermore, concerning the flus, it is doubtful whether he ever pictured to himself such absolute instability as his words imply. But we are tempted to ask, Is his system here really, as it first appears, inconsistent ? Mr. Borden P. Bowne in his Metaphysics (p. 89) says that the Heraclitic theory of change thus extremely conceived " is intelligible and possible only because it is false."</page><page sequence="69">625 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITES. Let us look at Mr. Bowne's argument. He has first shown in the same chapter that the Eleatic conception of rigid being without change is impossible, since in a world of absolute fixity, even the illusion of change would be impossible. Furthermore, he has shown that the vulgar conception of changeless being with chaEIging states is untenable, since the "state of a thing expresses what the thing is at the time. " Changing states would be uncaused and undetermined except as the being changes. There can be therefore no fixed useless core of being. In general there is no changeless being. All is change, all is becoming. Is there then, he asks, any permanence or identity what- ever, or is the e2ctreme Heraclitic position true ? It is false. Why ? Because, as in a world of E]eatic fixity, even the illusion of change would be impos- sible, so in a world of absolute change, even the appear- ance of rest would be impossible. There must be some abiding factor, that change may be known as change. There must be something permanent somewhere to make the notion of flow possible. This permanent something Mr. Bowne finds in the knowing subject- the conscious self. Having proceeded plainly up to this point, here he becomes mystical. The permanence of the conscious self, he continues, does not consist in any permanent substance of the soul. The soul forever changes equally with other being. The permanence consists in memory or self-consciousness. " How this is possible," he says, " there is no telling." The per- manence and identity of the soul consists, however, only in its ability " to gather up its past and carry it with it. " In this argument, Mr. Bowne's first fallacy is in saying that in a world of absolute change there must</page><page sequence="70">626 PATRIC:E: be some permanent factor in order that the change itself may be known. This is meaningless. Perma- nent as regards what ? Permanence as regards other moving factors is simply relative difference of change. Mr. Bowne seems to have committed the primitive error of supposing that because all things seem to move, he alone is fixed-like the earth in the Ptole- maic astronomy. According to his argument, if he were in a moving car and should meet another moving car, the perception of movement would be impossible. His reasoning assumes that by absolute change is meant uniform change all in one way, which would not be change at all, but absolute fixity. Dtfrerence is the essential element in change, and difference is all that is necessary to the idea of change. The assumption of permanent personality in order to make change itself possible is unnecessary. Mr. Bowne says that what constitutes permanence in the conscious self is its ability toj gather up its past and carry it with it. But a stratifying rock or growing tree gathers up its past and carries it with it. But the apparent perrnanence in the case of the rock or tree is a tempo- rarily abiding forzn or temporarily abiding spacial relations. The apparent permanence of personality may similarly consist wholly in a temporarily abiding form or relation, must in fact consist in this, since Mr. Bowne rejects any abiding soul substance. But temporarily abiding relations, the extreme Heracli- teans do not deny, certainly not Heraclitus, to whom apparent rest was due to the temporary equilibrium of opposite balancing forces. We conclude, therefore, that Mr. Bowne's charge of falsity against the theory of the Heraclitic flux is not well substantiated. Here as ever we see the difference between modern and</page><page sequence="71">627 A FURTHER 6TEDY OF HERACLITUS. ancient philosophy. The former looks within, the latter without. Mr. Bowne seeks the abiding within himself. Heraclitus looked away from himself to the Universal Order without, which determined all things and himself. But though the Heraclitic absolute flux is vindicated from objections of the above character, the question still remains unanswered whether the doctrine is con- sistent with his conception of absolute Order. Did not Heraclitus make the common mistake of hyposta- sizing law ? Did he not conceive of law as something by which the action of things is predetermined, rather than as a mere abstraction from the action of things ? No doubt he did even worse than this, for he ascribed to his xozvos Aoroc, attributes which led Bernays and Teichmiiller to believe that it was a self-conscious being, (a conclusion questioned by Zeller, Vol. 1, p. 609, 3). But yet again he saved his consistency here by identifying his Absolute with fire and thereby bringing it after all into the all-consuming vortex of endless change. But in the face of this all-embracing flux, the one idea which stands out most prominent in Heraclitus is the deep rationality of the world the eternal Order. Nor in the last analysis are these two at variance, for any world must be rational to the beings in it, for the rationality of the world to us is only our adaptation to the world, which is involved in the very fact of our existence. C:oncerning the cosmogony, it is worth while to re- call the suggestive thought contained in the xpayoav&gt; and xopo: of Heraclitus. In our examination of Schus- ter's work we found reason to believe that the word xp;qa,aovuv7g, which we may render sc craving " or sc long- ing," was used by the Ephesian to denote the charac-</page><page sequence="72">628 PATRICE: ter of the impulse or motive force by which the primi- tive world matter or fire evolved itself into the world of individual things. The records are too meagre to warrant much enlargement upon this idea; neverthe- less it is important historically and in itself interesting. It is the beginning of that line of thought which finds the analogy to the original motive or creative power of the universe, not in man's intellectual but in his emo- tional nature, not in pure thought but in pure desire. It is opposed to the conception of Aristotle that the absolute first mover is pure intellect, the thought of thought (&gt;o^§azs woapa)c), and to the modern German enlargement of the same which began with the intel- lectual monads of Leibuiz. On the other hand, it is in agreement with the idea brought out by Plato in his Symposium, the idea of Love as the source of devel- opment and immortality, and it reminds us later of Plotinus, who refuses to predicate thought or reason of the One but identifies it with the GLood. The Hera- clitic-Platonic notion is no less anthropomorphic than the Aristotelian-Leibnizian; but if the human mind must furnish forth some faculty to be singly hyposta- sized into God, we much prefer the richer emotional side to that of pure dry intellect or reason. We come now to the Heraclitic ethics, the freshest and most vital part of his philosophy, but most misun- derstood by all the critics. The practical ethical rule with Heraclitus is to follow the law of the state, which again is dependent upon the Divine Law (frags. 91, 100). From his standpoint this agrees with his in- junction to live according to Nature (frag. 107). More broadly stated, men should follow the Universal as opposed to individual whims. " The Law of Reason is common, but the majority of people live as though</page><page sequence="73">629 A T3tmTrTst D d" AD T A PT Td &lt; r Uh^a^b DlUUl VX DlSwDl1UD they had an understanding of their own " (fragX 92). This leads us directly to the theoretical ethical prin- ciple which lay at the root of all Heraclitus' philosophy, and whicll we have outlined above (p. 617) in defining his starting point as that of a preacher and prophet. The highest good was not contentment (EvapRaT^(az;) a statement taken from a single indefinite passage in Clement of Alexandria (Strom. ii. 21, p. 417; Clement is followed by Theodoretus, iv. p. 984, ed. Halle), and which, though adopted by Zeller, is as silly and impos- sible as the better authenticated statement that Hera- clitus wept over everything. Such an ethical principle ss at variance with every sentence of the Ephesian. He continually exhorts men, as we have seen, to arise, get out of their lethargy and wake up. His most pungent sarcasm is directed against the people who are in a state of indifference, sleepiness, contentment (frags. 22 3, 5, 94, 9S, etc.). The highest good with Hera- clitus, therefore, is the greatest intellectually acttvtty, the greatest reseptivtty to the divine reason around us, the greatest freedom from individual peculiarities and the greatest possession of that which is universal. cc Human nature," he says, '; does not possess under- standing, but the divine does " (frag. 96). We must look away from ourselves to Nature around us. We must follow the universal Reason therein expressed. Proximately for men this is best found in the common, the normal, the customary, finally therefore in public law. It will thus be notice(l. that we have in Heraclitus an emphatic expression c f the type of ethics peculiar to the Greeks. Of the individual he thought little. cv To me one is ten thous: Jnd if he be the best " (frag. 113). He blamed the F.phesians for their declaration</page><page sequence="74">630 PATRICE: of democracy (frag. 114). He would not have been able to appreciate those modern systems of ethics which make a moral law out of individual conscience and justify actions by good intentions. Heraclitus, as well as psychologists of recent times, seemed to appre- ciate the dangers of self-involution. His whole sys- tem is a protest against individual intensification. He will not have men roll themselves into a cocoon of a single system, or revolve in the circle of a single set of ideas. He will have them throw themselves open to the common light, keep every sense open and recep- tive to new impressions, and thereby attain truth, which is found in the universal alone. The optimism which Pfleiderer justifies for Hera- clitus does not stand in contradiction to the misan- thropy that we have found to characterize him. His optimism was thoroughly Leibnizian. It was reasoned optimism, resulting in the strong conviction that the world is good, rational and orderly. Most men, to be sure, are fools, but it is their own fault, as they will not put themselves in right relation to the world. GEottlob Mayer, in a pamphlet entitled cc Heraklit von Ephesus und Arthur Schol?enhauer,'' has been at pains to prove that Heraclitus is a Schopenhauer pessimist. We cannot regard his attempt as successful. Our study of the Ephesian philosopher in the preceding pages has shown nothing more clearly than that the logical result of his metaphysics is not, as this author claims, pessimism, but quite the opposite. None of the passages which he cites (cp. frags. 86, 5S, 84, 66, 20, 111) can be made to yield any pessimism beyond mis- anthropy, unless possibly the one from Lucian (Vit. Auct. c. 14, QNH TH3. tc rap o accei&gt; 8StC&gt;; HPA- KGEI TO3, racs 7rac:0w, 7revasuCx)v 8taepof&gt;evos, cp. frag.</page><page sequence="75">631 A FIJRTlIER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. 79), where Time is compared to a child at play, now arranging, now scattering the pebbles. And yet noth- ing is conclusive from this. It refers evidently to the periodic creation and destruction of the world. Whether this world building is a pastime of Jove, or the product of fate or of love, makes no difference in this case, provided only the resulting world is one well disposed and rational. II. What has given rise to the reviving interest in Eera- clitus attested by the monographs which have lately appeared ? The modern world hardly hopes to get any llew light from his oracular sayings gathered in muti- lated fragments from Philo and Plutarch, from Cle- ment and Origen. Such unhoped for light, however, as our introductory study has shown, may for some minds be found breaking in after all. But the interest in the philosopher of Ephesus is historical. The llew discovery of the present half century is that the way to study philosophy is to study its history, and especi- ally its genesis. The passion for origins has carried the interest back to Greek philosophy, and finally back to the beginnings of Greek philosophy. But there is still another reason for going back. In the confusion arising from the fall of the idealistic philosophy in Germany, it was first thought that it would be neces- sary to return to Kant and secure a new footing; not that any new light was seen emanating from Kant, but error having arisen, it was necessary to trace it to its source. This movement has neither been successful nor does it promise to be. In fact, there is a certain weariness in philosophy of the whole modern subjective method.</page><page sequence="76">632 P A TRICK: The result has been that thinkers have turned away from it to the one objective side of modern philosophy, namely, the sciences. Those, however, who still retain their love of philosophy in its larger sense, are going back farther than Kant. They see that the whole Hume-Kantian-Fichtean movement was a digression, a sort of branch road, which to be sure had to be explored before philosophy could go on in safety, but which was found to lead nowhere in particular, and that, having thanked these investigators for their ser- vices rendered, we may decline to concern ourselves further with this digression, but go on with our search for objective results. In this search our starting point must be from that philosophy which is most free from this whole subjective tendency. Such is the philosophy of Greece. Considering therefore that the introspective method has not proved so fruitful as was hoped, and that it is at least more modest if not ulore rational to regard man as a part of Nature, rather than Nature as a part of man, students of philosophy are turning their attention to the GEreek philosophers where the freer and more ingenuous conception rules. se two causes, therefore, the former? the passion for studying the origin and development of thought and the connection of different systems of thought, the latter, the need of disinfecting our minds from all the germs of a pathological introspective habit, and putting ourselves as an experiment in the position of those who took it for granted that Nature was larger than man, have led us back to Greek philosophy and especially to its sources. In either of these aspects Heraclitus is important. He is a perfect, by all means the most perfect, illustra- tion of those qualities which are usually supposed to</page><page sequence="77">633 A . 4'USTH £; g 3TU DY O. 45 z 3^CLITt S characterize the GUreek mind, namely, receptivity, url- prejudiced freedom of thought, love of order, and trust- ful confidence in the unity of man and Nature. Of all the Greek schools these qualities were best represented by the Ionian thinkers who, coming before what has been called s; the fall of man in Socrates" were free from the later dialectical disturbances. And of the Ionians, Heraclitus, the last, best incorporates them. But it is in the other aspect that the philosopher of Ephesus is most important, namely, in the origin and history of ideas. Let us notice summarily what has come from him. To Heraclitus we trace the philosophy of change, prominent in subsequent GEreek philosophy as zwofevov the indirect cause of the counter movement of Socrates and Plato with its powerful determining influences, central in modern times as motton in the pllilosophy of Hobbes and the ground principle in the important system of Trendelenburg, and finally in a logical trans- formation, prominent in both GEerman and English thought as WVerden or Becoming. To Eeraclitus we trace the notion of Relativity, the central point in the doctrine of the Sophists, which by withdrawing every absolute standard of truth, threatened to destroy all knowledge and all faith, and which sent Socrates searching for something permanent and fixed in the concepts of the human mind, and so led to the finished results of Plato and Aristotle. To Heraclitus we trace some of the fundamental doctrines of the Stoics, namely, their abrogation of the antithesis of mind and mattsr and their return to pre-Socratic monism, their conception of Nature as larger than Inan and his com- plete subjection to it, and finally their doctrine of the future conflagration of the world, later an influential factor in ahristianity.</page><page sequence="78">634 PATRICK: These were the thoughts which were most important in their determining influence upon subsequent philo- sophy. The following, while in themselves no less im- portant, were less directly involved in the history of opinion. Of these the first is the notion of Law and Order absolute and immanent in the world, an idea so large that no Greek follower could grasp it, and yet vital to Heraclitus' system, for without it his philo- sophy becomes the philosophy of desperation, the source among the ingenuous GUreeks of the nihilism of ()or- gias or the universal doubt of the skeptics, and among the brooding moderns the source of the pessimism of Schopenhauer. To Heraclitus again we trace, as Teichmuller has shown, the closely related doctrine of the immanence of Gkod in the world, so that we have in him one source of the pantheistic systems. To Hera- clitus, finally, we trace the physical law of opposites, the thought that all order and harmony and apparent permanence are the result of opposite tension, the bal- ance of centrifugal and centripetal forces. Less in- volved in the history of philosophy, though most im- portant to Heraclitus, and in themselves most interest- ing to us of modern times, are his great ethical thoughts which we have already outlined. The determinative ideas of the iliphesian may be summed up in a word by saying that they represent all that way of thinking against which Socrates and Plato raised the whole: weight of their authority. Without repeating here the facts, well enough known to everybody. of the Socratic reaction in G#reek philo- sophy, we must sketch one or two phases of it in order to establish the influence and explain the final defeat of the Heraclitic philosophy. In Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, philosophy underwent a change more radical</page><page sequence="79">635 A FIJRTHER STIJDY OF HERACLITES. than any other in its history, a change that was ulti- mately to revolutionize all thought, and through its influence on C:hristian theology, to enter as a large determining element into all western civilization. Heraclitus is the representative of what philosophy was before that change. Socrates said he could not understand the book of Heraclitus. That was not strange. The Ephesian could have told him the reason why. The man who could learn nothing from the fields and trees (see Plato's Phaedrus, p. 230), who spent all his time in the Agora conversing with other men about virtue, and who never seemed to realize that there was a world above the heads and under the feet of men, was not likely to' understand the book of Heraclitus. Could the Ephesian philosopher have taken the Atheni- an logician out and given him a few lessons from Nature at first hand, could he have induced him to desist for a while from his boring into human intellects in searcll of a definition, and got his gaze lifted up to the clouds and stars, and put him in actual contact with the Z:R,OtR/Ok, he would have been arl apter scholar with the book. But it is quite impossible even in fancy to think of these two men together. The communer with Nature, the stern misanthropic sage and prophet of Ephesus had no points in common with the society- loving Athenian sophist. They were radically differ- ent, and on this difference hangs the secret of the development of philosophy for two thousand years. Socrates was not a G#reek at all. He denied the most characteristic traits of his nation. lIe was a modern in many true senses. He was a curiosity at Athens, and consequently very much in vogue. Socrates represents the birth of self-consciousness. In</page><page sequence="80">636 PATRICK: practicing his maieutic art to this end, he little thought that he was giving the death-blow to the most beauti- ful trait of his countrymen, namely, the instinctive, the unconscious, the naive. No doubt this new birth had to take place some time, but under Socrates' direction it was premature. The old methods were not yet dead. Here historians of philosophy err. They say the pre-Socratic philosophers of Nature had in vain tried to solve the prololems of the world, and it was high time for a critical philosophy that should begin with man. In vain, indeed ! Had the naturalists labored in vain when the foundation of the atomic philosophy had been laid in Abdera, that of mathematics in Italy, and a far-seeing metaphysics and ethics in Ephesus ? Soc- rates and Plato took fright too easily at the Sophists. Their philosophy would have died with them. Not so that of Democritus, Pythagoras, and Heraclitus. Soc- rates was a professor of clear thinking. Clear thinking is in itself well, but two solid centuries of clear think- ing from Descartes to Hegel have in modern times ellded in failure. We long to know what natural thinking would have accomplished if it had been left an open field a while longer in G#reece. Then again clear thinking was overdone. It was, to be sure, not Socrates' fault that his method was afterwards abused, but as, a matter of fact it took in later history a patho- logical turn that has resulted in wide-spread evils. Over self-consciousness, too much inwardness and painful self-inspection, absence of trust in our instincts and of the healthful study of Nature, which in ethics are illustrated in modern questions of casuistry, and in philosophy in Cartesian doubt and the skepticism of Hume, characterize our worst faults. The philosophy and ethics of Heraclitusn as we have seen, stood in vital opposition to all these traits.</page><page sequence="81">637 A tBnr tnt ^ TTD A ^T smra v 1! U XJ1 11D1 D L U 1J 1 tJX I11;Wt/D11 U iZ&gt;* But there was another respect in which the fall of man took place in Socrates. The love of beauty and form, and particularly beauty of the human body, characterized all the Glreeks until Socrates, but char- acterizes modern people in a relatively small degree. Socrates cared nothing for outward beauty, but to the surprise of his fellow-citizens laid all the emphasis upon moral beauty. (We will say he xvas too large hearted to have had a pt?rsonal motive for so doing.) It may be that the GUreeks estimated physical beauty relatively too high, but the rebound has been too great. Caught up by the genius of Plato and inten- sified by the tenor of his philosophy, and met six centuries later in Alexandria by a powerful current of the same tendency from Judea, it effected the com- plete destruction of the Glreek idea, and with it of course of G#reek art. In the medieval churclln inherited moral deformity was a sin of such extreme import, that for it a man was to be forever damned; but inher- ited physical deformity was not only not a sin, but often a blessing, teaching him as it did the relative worthlessness of the earthly life and body. So far was the Greek idea reversed that the body, instead of being the type of beauty, became the type of impurity, and from being the support of the soul, became its con- taminator. The "flesh,n' indeed, was the symbol of evil. The results in modern life are orlly too well known. Among them may be mentioned the loss of appreciation of the worth of the present physical life in itself, failure to recognize the close connection of soul and body, and that the health of the former depends on the health of the latter, resultlng in all the strange devices to secure the welfare of the soul in the face of persistent disregard of the laws of physical</page><page sequence="82">638 PATRICR: health, or in such attempts as that of sustaining the moral status of a community where all hygienic laws are violated. This idea has been ground into the popular mind by so long education that modern educators find it a serious problem how to correct it. It is not merely physical education that is wanted, but a reconstruction of our notions about the relation of body and mind. The Socratic work must be in part undone, and we must get back more nearly to the pre- Socratic conception of balance, for to them physical ugliness was no less an evil than moral ugliness. But there is still another aspect of the Socratic apostasy, as important as those we have mentioned, and so far-reaching in its effects that it determines modern thought even to the lowest ranks of society. In this movement begun by Socrates, but perfected by Plato and Aristotle, the central thought of the Heraclitic phi- losophy was denied, and denied with such power that now after twenty-two hundred years it hardly dares assert itself. We refer, of course, to the Platonic tran- scendentalism. It was designed to give the death-blow to Heraclitus, and it succeeded ultimately beyond the wildest hopes of its founders. Strictly it was loegun by Anaxagoras. We have already seen with Teichmuller how the doctrine of transcendent reason gained its first characteristic, Pure Separation, in the Nous of Anax- -agoras, its second, Identity, in the definitive work of Socrates. But it was Plato who elevated it into a great system and gave it to the world for a perpetual inheritance. Finally, Aristotle, as if the fates con- spired to make this doctrine immortal, took it up and adapted it to unpoetical inductive minds. Heraclitus in a wonderful conception of the world had abolished every alltithesis and enunciated a system of pure</page><page sequence="83">639 A FERTHER STEDY OF HERACLITES. monism. The Socratic school reversed his plan and set up a dualism of universal and particular, noumenon and phenomenon, mind and body, spirit and matter which has dominated all philosophy, religion and literature. It is with the origin of this dualism that we are concerned, not with the familiar history of its out- come, but yet we may recall what to the student of philosophy or even of history it is needless to more than mention, how this dualism fastened itself upon subsequent thought; how as realism and nominalism it divided the schoolmen; how as mind and matter it left Descartes in hopeless difficulty; how Spinoza founded a philosophy expressly to resolve it, but suc- ceeded only by the artifice of terms; how Leibnitz solved the problem, though with too much violence, by use of the same boldness with which its founders established it; how Kant finally left the antithesis unexplained; how again as the material and irnrna- terial it fixed itself in the psychology of Aristotle, who afflrmed as the higher part of the human mind, the active Nous or principle of pure immateriality, cogniz- ant of the highest things, identical with the divine Prime Mover, and immortal thus constituting for man the highest glorification that he ever received from his own hand; how Thomas Aquinas, spokesman for a powerful church, adopted this psychology and fast- ened it upon the modern popular world; how finally, in the sphere of religion proper, the transcendent- alism of Plato has grown into the belief in pure Spirit and spiritual existences, peopling heaven and earth, and holding communion with matter and body, though having absolutely nothing in common (if the paradox may be excused) with themv Such has been in part the wonderful expansion of the Platonic Idealism.</page><page sequence="84">640 PATRICE: And what was all this for in the first place ? It was raised primarily as a barrier against the dissolving power of the eternal flux of the Heracliteans. A philo- sophy had arisen in GUreece that denied all perma- nence. Misunderstood by the Sophists and abused by Cratylus, it called out the protest of Socrates, at heart the sincerest man of his contemporaries. Man, im- pelled by that very faculty which connects him most closely with Nature, namely, the sense of dependence, demands something permanezlt and unchangeable, upon which he can base his laws, religion and philo- sophy. If he cannot find it in Nature or in Revelation, he will make it out of a part of himself. This is what Socrates and Plato did. Socrates, seeking the perma- nent for ethical motives, detesting Nature and failing to find there anything fixed and abiding, turned to man and man's manner of thinking. By analysis of thought he separated out general concepts which ap- peared to be the same for all. Plato, perhaps less in earnest than subsequent ages gave him credit for, hypostasized them, raised them into real objecttre existences, henceforth to become idols, convenient entities to fill all gaps in human reasoning, objects of the dreams of poets and the worship of the religious, archetypes from which a lazy philosophy could deduce the universe. How, we naturally ask, could this auda- cious piece of anthropomorphism, in which man delib- erately took his own norms of thought, projected them outward, and elevated them into gods, impose itself upon the world as it did? There are two answers. First, it flattered men immensely, and like all anthro- pomorphisms, thereby won half the battle. Second, it did not succeed at once, but slumbered for four centu- ries, and finally, in the decadence of all systems of</page><page sequence="85">641 A FURTHER STEDY 0F HERACLITUS. philosophy and the breaking up of the old civilization, awakened to supplyt the groundwork of a religious revival. Platonism fell dead on the Greek world. Plato, and Aristotle as well, shot over the heads of their fellows. The philosophy of the Academy was a brilliant piece of speculation such as only the age of Pericles could call out. After that, philosophy fell back into the old ways. The Older Academy dragged out a short existence and died. Zeno, a Cypriote, but in his desire for unity more GUreek than Plato, studied first with Polemo, head of the Academy, but disap- pointed with Platonism, turned back to lIeraclitus. His school, as well as the Epicureans and Skeptics, returned to the Eleraclitic monism. These schools loyally upheld for three centuries the Greek idea of the unity of man and Nature. But philosophy itself was doomed and fated to pass over into religion on the one hand and mysticism on the other. Platonism was admirably adapted to this end. In luxurious Alex- andria, the weary inductive method of Aristotle, which the Ptolemies had instituted in the Museum, soon yielded to the fascinating lazy philosophy of Plato. Philo the Jew, Plutarch the moralist, Valentinus the Gnostic, Origen the Christian, all yielded to it in greater or less degree. In Plotinus it reached its full fruitage. Porphyry, his pupil, relates that he was ashamed of having a body and was careless of its needs, so anxious was he ecstatically to absorb his soul in the Supra-rational Transcendent One. lIere we have a last consequence of the Socratic doctrine of mind. Here we have the extreme opposition to the naturalism of IIeraclitus which considered man as a subordinate part of Nature. Greek philosophy ended with the triumph of Socrates and the defeat of IIera-</page><page sequence="86">642 PATRICE: clitus. The wealth of Plato and Aristotle was the bequest that was handed over to the coming centuries. The Greek naturalists were forgotten. It was reserved for the present century to revive and vindicate them. In what has been said in setting in relief the philo- sophy of Heraclitus, it is obvious that we have been concerned with but two or three aspects of that of Socrates and Plato, namely, its transcendental, ideal- istic and subjective character. It is not necessary to add that were we referring to other sides of it, as for instance, the undeniable importance of Socrates' con- tribution to ethics, and that of Plato to ethics and reli- gion as well as to real scientific thought, the result rould be very different. And of the Idealism itself, its very fascination and prevalence argue that it meets some want of human beings. It is poetry to be sure, but as poetry it has been and will still be useful in saving men from the dangers of coarse materialistic thought.</page><page sequence="87">HERACLITUS OF EPHESUS ON NATURE.

He thus praises and admires the unknown and unseen more than the known. And that that which is discoverable and visible to men is [better], he says in these words, " Whatever concerns seeing hearing, and learning, I particularly honor," that is, the lTisible above the invisible. From such expressions it is easy to understand him. In the knowledge of the visible, he says, men allow themselves to be deceived as Homer was, who yet was wiser than all the Greeks; for some boys killing lice deceived him saying, " WVhat we see and catch we leave behind; what we neither see nor catch we take with us " (frag. 1, Schuster). Thus Heraclitus honors in equal degree the seen and the unseen, as if the seen and unseen were confessedly one. For what does he say ? " A hidden harmony is better than a visible," and, " Whatever concerns seeing, hearing, and learning, I particularly honor," having before particularly honored the invisible. XV.- Polybius sii. 27.

Our sord Reason may express the same idea more in accord with the thought of that time (see Introduction, p. 618 ff.). Zeller and Pfleiderer understand by it, Reason ruling or immanent in the world; Heinze, the obiective (unconsciolls) law of Reason; Bernays, conscious Intelligence; Teichmuller, self-conscious Reason; Schuster, on the other hand, regards it as the "revelation oiVere(l us by the audible Speech of Nature." In the present passage, Zeller is inclined to understand by rov Soyov TOVdE, primarily the discourse of the author, but contain- ing also the idea of the content of the discourse, z. e. the theory of the world laid down in his book (Vol. 1, p. 572, 2).

Note 8. rt.pryCrrip is rendered by Schuster "fiery wind" such as forms the stars. Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 588,1) believes it has essen- tially the same signification as KepavvOf in frag. 28, both words being other terms for the world-ruling fire or formative principle of the world. FRAGMENT 23. Note 9. Eusebius omits Ywi, and is followed by Lassalle and Heinze. The former (Vol. 2, P. 63) translates, "Das Meer wird ausgegossen und gemessen nach demselben Logos, welcher zuerst war, ehe es (selbst) noch war," and finds here a confirmation of his interpretation of the Logos as the eternal preexisting law of the identity of being and not-being. Heinze understands it as follows: "Das Meer verwandelt sich in denselben Logos, also in dasselbe Feuer, von welcher Beschaffenheit es w-orher war, ehe es selbst entstand." Schuster reads ywiv and translates, " Das Meer ergiesst sich und nisnmt sein Maass ein im selben Umfang, wie damals als lloch keine Erde war" (p. 129). Zeller reads ya and understands the passage to refer to the return of the earth into the sea from which it sprang. By iL6yof here he understands "proportion of magnitude " or " size," so that ef, ov avroV AoyoV means that the sea returns " to the same size " as before it became earth (Vol. 1, p. 628, 3).

This fragment is not accepted by Zeller, who holds that air was not recognized by Heraclitus as one of the elements, but that he accepted only the three, fire, water, and earth. Air was added, Zeller thinks, by later writers, who confused it with the " soul " of Heraclitus (Vol. 1, p. 615). Schuster, who thinks Hera- clitus did not teach a specific number of elements after the manner of Empedocles, regards the passage as trustworthy (p. 157 ff.). Teichmuller gives to air an important place in the system of Heracli- tus, distinguishing the upper E)ure air, which is not difEerent from fire, and the impure lower air (Vol. 1, p. 62).</page><page sequence="120">676 PATRICK: FRAGMENT 27. Note 12. Schleiermacher, followed by Mullach, reads Tzva for ttf, SO that the sense becomes, "How can that which never sets escape any one ? " This is unnecessary and violates the context in Clement. That srhich never sets is the eternal Order or Law, con- ceived here as Destiny or Justice. According to Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 590), that which never sets is fire. According to Schuster (p. 184), it is Relation or Law, and the Ttf refers to Helios, which, though itself the centre of power and intelligence, is yet subject to law. Teich- muller (Vol. 1, p. 184) understands it to refer to Justice or Destiny, which nex er sets like the sun, and which none can escape. FRAGMENT 35. Note 13. IIAel¢rG)v may be taken as neuter: "Hesiod ras a teacher of the greatest number of things." On the unity of day and night, compare Introduction, p. 591 f. FRAGMENT 36. Note 14. The original text, which reads OKbTaV CV#8Cyt7 it6yaCe, has been variously colrrected. As the subject of av,u,uty7, Schuster inserts olvof, the sense then beingthat as wine is mised with spices and labelled as any one pleases, so God receives different names under diiTerent forms (p. 188). Bywater, following Bernays (Rhein. Mus. ix. 245), inserts %S8aX and Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 602, 2) reads OK(X)f aap for OKS:X6p Teichmuller (Vol. 1, p. 67) attempts to save the original reading by making o flsos, (z. e. fire) the subject both of a7L7LocoUrat and CV,U,Ulyv . The correction of Bernays is the most satisfactory; the meaning then being, that as when perfumes are mixed, the mixture is named according to the scent that impresses each person, so God is named according to the attribute that most impresses the individual. Com- pare frag. 6o. About the same sense, however, is derived from the other readings. FRAGMENT 38. Note 15.-Schleiermacher and Zeller think it doubtful whether any sense can be made out of this fragment. For Schuster's fanciflll explanation, see Introduction, p. 577 f. Bernays (Rhein. Mus. ix. p. 265, 6) interprets it to mean that the perception of fire, upon which depends the existence of the soul, is gained after death and the extinction of the sense of sight, by the sense of smell, just as the passage from Aristotle (frag. 37) teaches that in the conflagra- tion of the world, all perception will be by the nostrils. Pfleiderer (p. 218) suggests oCtoUvral for oSvrac.</page><page sequence="121">677 A FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. FRAGMENT 40. Note 16. Of this passage from Plutarch only the words AKtdV8ff( Ka ¢srayEe, daseaL Ka a7rEz:z, can with any certainty be attributed directly to Heraclitus. The rest bears marks of later hands, as shown by Bernays (Heraklit. Briefe, p. 55), and Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 576, 2). FRAGMENT 45. Note 17. Bernays' explanation of this passage (Rhein. Mus. sii. P. 94; compare Introduction, p. 603 f.) has been followed by Zeller, Schuster (partly), and Arnold Hug. According to this interpretation, the association of the bow and lyre lies in their form, which in the case of the old Greek or Scythian bow with its arms bent back at the ends, was like that of the lyre. Hence we have in the bow and the lyre, two distinct illustrations of harmony by opposite straining tension. Lassalle (Vol. 1, p. 113) understands it to refer to the harmony bet?zeen the bow and the lyre; the bow and the lyre being symbols in the Apollo cult, the one of singularity and di1Ter- ence, the other, of universality and union. On Pfleiderer's modi- fication of Lassalle's view, see Introduction, p. 603. In place of T6$0V Kaz 7Lvpf Bast reads rov o$Rof rE Kaz pepEof. Bergk conjectures T6fov Kau verpf.

The common reading is wav EpfrEraV eV yaV v8tTat which Zeller retains, understanding it to refer to the beastliness o:f men, who " feed upon the earth like the worm " (Vol. 1, p. 660). Pfleiderer likewise accepts this reading, quoting Sallust, Catil. 1: Vitam silentio transeunt veluti pecora, quae natura prona atque ventri obedientia finxit. That rtaysi, the reading of Stobaeus, followed by Bywater, is correct, however, is shown by comparison with JEschylus, Ag. 358, heof 7rkayav etov¢lv elvez", and Plato's Criti. 109 B, Kat9aFrep sroziueveS KrfiV7y srA7y1,1 VE#OVREf. With this reading, the sense then becomes that man is subject to eternal divine force or law.</page><page sequence="122">678 PATRICK: FRAGMENT 56. Note 21.-Compare frag. 45 and note 17. Bywater reads raRtvrovos dpllori)7, here; but though in three passages, those namely given under this fragment, fra71tproloof is found in the MSS, yet the context even in Plutarch, where sharps and flats are spoken of, calls for the meaning "harmony of oppositions," as explained in note 17, for which we should expect rAzvrpoirof rather than ra?&gt;z&gt;, ovo. FRAGMENT 60. Note 22. What is referred to by ravTaX { these things," has been questioned. Teichmuller, followed by Pfleiderer, has given the true explanation. Tav; refers to some idea the opposite of " justice." Clement is illustrating the Pauline principle that without law there would have been no sin. For this, Heraclitus, whose prominent thought was, no war without peace, no good without bad, etc., serlted him as good authority. FRAGMENT 62. Note 23.-The original text is as follows: Ez dE XPv TOV T2e#OV Eowra fuviiv Kaz zKA/V EpElV K(tl yZvo#EvA ravra zar' mlV za tpES#EVa. Schleiermacher proposes Et8EVt for Et 4E and EpZV for EpEtV, and has been followed by Zeller, Bywater and others. Schuster retains the MS form in the first clause. XpES#EVa also gives trouble. Brandis proposes :rbAcEva. Schuster reads KaraxpeSA6vXzs approved by Zeller Lassalle and Bywater retain X,OES,UEIJa. This passive use is unusual, but possible, as shown by the analogy of zaraXpEs,aeva. The transla- tions of Schuster and Lassalle are as follows: Schuster (p. 198)-" In dem Falle muss man also den gemeinsamen Krieg sogar Recht nennen und [sagen] das alles [nur] in Folge des Streites entsteht und sich aufbraucht.' Lassalle-" Man mllss wissen dass der Krieg das Gemeinsam ist, und der Streit da&gt;3 Recht, und dass nach dem Gesetz des Streit;s alles wird und verwendet wird (or lit. und sich bethoitigt)." gvbs in this passage has almost the signification " common good." FRAGMENT 64. Note 24. Critics have expended their ingenuity in trying to make something out of this obscure fragment Teichmuller (Vol. 1, p. 97 f.) says that we have here the distinction of the intelligible from the sensible world. The former is the pure, light, Sery and most incor- poreal being, compared with which the world of the senses is death. Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 651) similarly refers it to the testimony of the senses, which see the world as something " stifE and dead," when really everything is in constant motion. Schuster (p. 276) labors with a far fetched interpretation to show that the passage does not</page><page sequence="123">679 A FURTHER STEDY OF HERACLITES. cast any disparagement upon the senses. For Pfleidererts explana- tion, see Introduction, p. 602. All these interpretations look for a theoretical meaning, when it is quite possible that no theoretical meaning was intended. It is simpler to compare it with frag. 2, and refer it to Heraclitus' repeated charge against the people, of their sleep-like condition when awake. FRAGMENT 65. Note 25. We have followed Schuster's punctuation of this frag- ment. Bywater, with other critics, reads, NEV T0 60t0V fOtwVOV XEyEC&amp;t OtK £0E2EZ Kaz E0E^E't ZUMOC orvoya. To aofov, here, is the world- ruling Wisdom or Order, to which Heraclitus applies many names. (See Introduction, p. 619 f.) It wills and wills not to be called by the name of Zeus, because that name, while it points towards its true nature, yet but partly indicates it, or in part mTrongly. The variety of meanings, however, which have been drawn from this fragment may be shown by the following translations. Schlei- ermacher (and Lassalle): " Das Eine Weise allein will nicht ausgesprochen werden und will ausgesprochen mTerden, der Name des Zeus." Schuster: " Nur eines ist die Weisheit; sie lasst sich nicht und lasst sich doch auch wieder benennen mit des Zeus Namen." Bernays: "Eines, das allein Weise, will und will auch nicht mit des zvv Wamen genannt werden." The poetical form zavof is chosen, thinks Bernays, to indicate that the One WVise is the source of sc life." Zeller: " Eines, das allein Weise, will und will auch nicht mit dem Nanlen des Zeus benannt werden." Pfleiderer: "Als Eins will das weise Allwesen, Zeus genannt, nicht bezeichnet werden und will es." Teichmuller: "Die Weisheit, Zeus genannt, will allein eins heissen und will es auch nicht." FRAGMENT 72. Note 26. This fragment is connected by Schuster and Zeller with the group of passages concerning rest in change (see frags. 82, 83)} and refers to the pleasure which the rest and change of death bring to souls. They therefore reject the ,v fyararov of Numenius as not Heraclitic. (Schuster, p. 191,1. Zeller, p. 647,2.) Pfleiderer, howv- ever (p. 222), retains the ,v eaWaTUv as genuine, and explains that it is a pleasure to souls to become wet, because so by pursuing the way down into al)parent death, they attain their new birth of life ill death. He therefore retains also the 4 EpttV 4E' Etvat avratf TaV Fif r?'lM yEvE:zv gTr:lV, of Numenius, as expressing the true sense of the passage. FRAG)IENT 74. Note 27. The added clause of Plutarch, " It fl&amp;shes through the body like lightning through the clouds," is also regarded by Schleier- macher, Schuster, Zeller, and Pfleiderer, as Heraclitic.</page><page sequence="124">680 PATRIC:E: The similarity of the three fragments 74, 75, and 76 suggests, of course, that they are all corrupted forms of a common original. Bywater, however, accepts the form of expression in frag. 74 as surely Heraclitic and marks the other two as doubtful. Schleier- macher, from the number of citations of each of these fragments, concludes that Heraclitus had expressed himself in each of these three forms. Lassalle, in agreeing with him, believes also that Heraclitus, who was given to playing upon words (for further examples of Heraclitus' puns, compare frags. 91,101,127, 66), not without purpose chose the w-ords avA and evyv, and sees in the use of the latter word a reference to the lightning-like movement of the soul (Vol. 2, p. 196 f.). Zeller thinks it difflcult to determine the original form, but he does not regard the proposition euyv F8 Wvxv ao0STaT as Heraclitic (Vol. 1, p. 643, 2). FRAGMENT 77. Note 28. The original of this difficult and corrupted passage as it appears in Clement, is as follows (unpunctuated), tAvfUprs? ev evfpovu faof arreraz eavry arodavsv afroape:0Etf ;v f3e aFrTeTaz TE0JESTOf EV6SV arro:pe:0eif o+Etf eypg7t/op arreraz erlSovro. Various emendations and translations of this have been made. Compare Schuster, p. 271; Pfleiderer, p. 204,1. Bywater, however, finally rescues as Hera- clitic the form given above in the text. FRAGMENT 80. Note 29.-That this fragment is to be taken in the sense in which Diogenes understands it, rather than in that of Plutarch, is held by Schuster (p. 61) and Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 654, 4). Lassalle (Vol. 1, p. 301), following Schleiermacher, takes it as Clement does, in the sense of the Delphic inscription, " I have sought myself in the general flux of things, I have striven to know myself." For Pfleiderer's inter- pretation and the true meaning, see Introduction, pp. 600, 607. FRAGMENT 82. Note 30. Lassalle, following Creuzer, reads ayXeat instead of apXe:8at (Vol. 1, p. 181.) FRAGMENT 90. Note 31. Lassalle (Vol. 1, p. 290) interprets this fragment as follows: In waking, we distinguish our ovw n representations from the objective world common to all. In sleeping, they are one and the same. Hence Heraclitus says the sleeping make their own world. Similarly Pfleiderer (p. 202 f.) understands Heraclitus to mean that the sleeper makes his own world, while the waking man is con- scious that corresponding to his world of ideas there is a common</page><page sequence="125">681 A FIJRTHER 8TEDY OF HERAaLITE8. objective world. Pfleiderer rejects Ecai avvepyovf as an addition of Aurelius. FRAGMENT 97. Note 32.-This fragment has given trouble. Bernays (Heraclitea 15) proposes to substitute o$a 7filovof for datyovof, but has not been followed by other critics. Schleiermacher transtates, " Ein thorichter Mann vernimmt nicht mehr von Schicksal als ein Kind von einem Mann." Schuster (p. 342) renders, " Der Mensch in seiner Kindheit hat (sie [i. e. the names]) von Gott gehort, wie (jetzt) das Kind von dem Manne," and finds here support for the theory of the natural fitness of names (see Introduction, p. 575), which primitive man learnedl directly from Nature. Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 653) refers it to the childish want of reason in man, which does not perceive the voice of the deity. Pfleiderer (p. 51) renders, " Der unverstandige Mensch hat von jeher nur soviel von der Gottheit gehort, als ein Kind vom Manne." FRAGMENT 103. Note 33.-Yppzv here is to be taken in the sense of excess of self- assertion, the private will against the universal Law. Compare frags. 92, 104, etc. FRAGMENT 107. Note 34. The latter clause may also be translated, "Wisdom is to speak and act truly, giving ear to Nature." FRAGMENT 110. Note 35.-Clementine MS reads povAry. Eusebius, followed by all but Mullach, reads povA. For Heraclitus' opinions on democracy, see, further, frags. 114,113. FRAGMENT 116. Note 36. The passage in Clement is as follows: aa Ta /1eV rryf yvSCESf pat}# /cpv7rretv a7reariU av aery /ca{8 'HpalcAszrov * aFreCTzU yap 4eafryyavEl yry ytyMSC/CEC0at from which it is seen that the words of Heraclitus, aFrzaTzX7 6eafryyaMEl ,llrl ytyv@CKEC0al were diferently understood by Clement and Plutarch. Schuster (p. 72) accepts th e Clementine form, and regards the whole passage as Heraclitic, and renders, " Die Tiefe der Erkenntniss zu verbergen, das ist ein gutes Misstrauen. Denn dllrch diese miss- trauische Behutsamkeit entgeht man dem Schicksal durchschaut zu werden," by which he accounts for the (intentional) obscurity of Heraclitus' writings. Zeller (Vol. 1, p. 574, 2), following Schleier- macher, rejects the Clementine version, and regards the words as teaching that truth is hidden from the masses because it seems incredible to them. A still difl erent meaning may be found in the words if we take aTlarlU as subjective, referring to the want of faith which prevents us from seeing truth.</page><page sequence="126">682 PATRICK ' FRAGMENT 118. Note 37.--The common reading is, 400EOVTSV O &amp;K@@rdrof yevaKel fvAaCCezv} which makes nonsense. Schleiermacher proposes KEovra o doecc,rarof yzv:Keev fvAa:aszv. Schuster (p. 340) suggests, doKEjl5vrSv, o hyoKe/uSTaTov ylvETal, &gt;ev@aKEt fv7laaC£tv, and fancies the allusion is to the poets} who from credible things accept that which is most credible. Bergk, followed by Pfleiderer, reads 0^va:aRZv, to talk nonsense. Bernays, followed by Bywater, reads TXavaRev. FRAGMENT 121. Note 38. This fragment has been variously translated, but the meaning seems to be that a man's God or Destiny depends not upon external divine powers, but upon his own inner nature. Teichmuller finds here the further meaning that the essence of mind is the essence of deity. FRAGMENT 123. Note 39. The meaning of this passage is N ery doubtful. We have followed Bernays' reading instead of the common evSa e15vrz, which Bywater retains7 although he marks it uncertain. Schuster (p. 176, 13 suggests [al#v eftEAst] Eviaf5E tOVTt trtzaraaat lfai fv71asof /C. T. i. Zeller (5iol. 1, p. 648, 4) regards it as a reference to the demons who are made protectors of men. Lassalle (Vol. 1, p. 185) thinks it refers to a resurrection of souls. FRAGMENT 127. Note 40. For text and discussion of this passage, see Introduction, p. 611 fE. Teichmuller7s interpretation of it is as follows: " Wenn es nicht Dionysus ware, dem sie die Processionfuhren und dabeidas Lied auf die Schamglieder singen, so wtire das Schamloseste ausgefuhrt. Nun aber, ist Hades (der Sohn der Scham) derselbe urie Dionysus, dem sie rasen und Feste feiern.'} This means, says Teichmuller, that the shameful and the becoming are the same gIdentification of opposites). For what is improper for men is proper for Dionysus, because he is the same as Hades, and Hades is the sama as shame, which latter he attempts to prove from Plutarch, de Is. 29 b. Again, Dionysus aIld Hades are the same because the former staIlds for the sun and the latter for the lower world, and as the sun is absorbed into the earth at night and generated therefrom in the morning, they must be essentially the same. (Neue Studien, Vol. 12 p. 25.) FRAGMENT 12'3. Note 41.-That the use of this term w-as ironical, is made probable by the following fragment.</page><page sequence="127">683 s FURTHER STUDY OF HERACLITUS. HPAK^EITOt EbESIOY IIEPI bYEEQ2.
