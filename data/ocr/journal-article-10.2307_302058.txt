Beckett: Watt, Watt The literary revolution called Modernism that took place at the end of the nineteenth century in reaction against the European middle class ethos and reached its apogee in the work of such writers as Marcel Proust, St6phane Mallarm6, W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, and Virginia Woolf -- and in the New Criticism -- was, ideologically, a revolt against the Western humanistic tradition and, aesthetically, against the 'Aristotelian" tradition. The modern movement continues to the present 147</page><page sequence="2">to be characterized by its "anti-Westernism" and its "anti-Aristotelianism." But about the time of World War II, which witnessed -- especially in the context of the Resistance -- the emergence of Existentialism not merely as a philosophy but as a mode of consciousness, the "anti-Aristotelianism" of the modern movement underwent a metamorphosis so profound that it has become necessary, I submit, to differentiate between an early or Sym- bolist modernism and a later "postmodernism." Broadly speaking, the anti-Westernism of the Symbolists was above all an aesthetic reaction against the humanistic principle of utility, the imperative that man's role vis-a-vis the material world was to control or, more accurately, to manipulate Nature (the word "manipulate" will assume a different significance for the existential imagination) in behalf of the material wellbeing of man. Analogously, the anti-Aristotelianism of the Symbolists constituted a rejection of "prose" in favor of "poetry" or, as Henri Bergson observes in Time and Free Will, a rejection of language that solidifies "our conscious states" for the purposes of social action in favor of a language that achieves an autonomous and something like auto- telic status. On the level of mimesis, Symbolist anti-Aristotelianism con- stituted a rejection of the primacy of linear and temporal plot in favor of the simultaneity of "spatial form." I will return to this all too brief defin- ition of Symbolist modernism. What I wish to suggest at the outset is that, unlike the early modern imagination -- indeed, in partial reaction against its refusal of historicity -- the postmodern imagination, agonized as it has been by the on-going boundary situation which is contemporary history, is an existential imagination. Its anti-Aristotelianism -- its refusal to fulfill causally oriented expectations, to create fictions (and in extreme cases, sentences) with beginnings, middles, and ends-- has its source, not so much in an aesthetic as in an existential critique of the traditional Western view of man in the world, especially as it has been formulated by positivistic science and disseminated by the vested interests of the modern -- technol- ogical -- City. It is not, in other words, the ugliness, the busyness, the nois- iness of a world organized on the principle of utility that has called forth postmodern anti-Aristotelianism; it is rather, though the two are not mut- ually exclusive, the anthropomorphic objectification of a world in which God is dead or has withdrawn. At the heart of the existential critique of positivistic humanism -- indeed, at the heart of all existential philosophies as such -- is the well known but too often misunderstood concept of dread (Angst) or, rather, the distinction between dread and fear (Furcht). According to Heidegger, for example, who, it should be remembered, derived his fundamental cate- gories from SBren Kierkegaard, dread differs radically from fear. "We are always afraid of this or that definite thing which threatens us in this or 148</page><page sequence="3">that definite way." Fear, in other words, has an object which, as Tillich puts it with Kierkegaard and Heidegger clearly in mind, "can be faced, analyzed, attacked, endured." That is, fear has no ontological status be- cause, having an object that can, as it were, be taken hold of, one is certain that it can be dealt with: eliminated or neutralized or even used. (This obsessive need to take hold of nothing, it is worth observing, reminds us of Keats's implicit criticism of the kind of writer who, because he does not have Negative Capability, reaches irritably "after fact or reason.") Dread, on the other hand, has no thing or nothing as its object. This "indefiniteness of what we dread is not just lack of definition: it re- presents the essential impossibility of defining the 'what.'" It is, in other words, an existential and ontological (as opposed to existentiell and ontic) structure of reality: In dread, as we say, "one feels something un- canny [unheimlich] ." What is this "something" [es] and this "one"? We are unable to say what gives "one that uncanny feeling. "One" just feels it generally [im Ganzen]. All things, and we with them, sink into a sort of indifference. But not in the sense that everything dis- appears; rather, in the very act of drawing away from us everything turns towards us. This withdrawal of what-is- in-totality, which crowds round us in dread, this is what oppresses us. There is nothing [as there is in fear] to hold on to. The only thing that remains and overwhelms us whilst what-is slips away, is this "nothing." What is crucial to perceive in Heidegger's phenomenological example is that dread generates a withdrawal of the world as web of definite or de- fined objects ("what-is-in-totality") and discloses itself in its primordial ontological state, which is oppressive not only because it "crowds round us" -- invades, as it were, our formerly secure world -- but also because it provides us -- like the chorus in the epigraph from Eliot's The Family Re- union -- with "nothing to hold on to." Following Kierkegaard, whose existentialism exfoliates from his assertion that "Nothing begets dread," Heidegger concludes: "Dread reveals Nothing." Put in the way suggested by his reference to the feeling of uncanniness (Unheimlichkeit), dread dis- closes Dasein's (human being's) not-at-homeness in the world. Seen in the light of the existential distinction between dread and fear, the Western perspective -- by which I specifically mean the rational or rather the positivistic structure of consciousness that views spatial and temporal phenomena in the world as "problems" to be "solved" -- con- 149</page><page sequence="4">stitutes a self-deceptive effort to find objects for dread in order to dom- esticate -- to at-home -- the threatening realm of Nothingness, the not-at- home, into which Dasein is thrown (geworfen). It is, in other words, a rigidified, evasive anthropomorphism which obsessively attempts by co- ercion to fix and stabilize the elusive flux of existence from the vantage point of a final rational cause. By means of this coercive transformation, the positivistic structure of consciousness is able not only to manipulate, to lay hands on, the irrational world (including man, of course) for the purpose of achieving what one early spokesman for this perspective referred to as "humane empire" over nature "for the benefit of man's estate." More basically, according to the existentialists, it can also justify the absurdity of human existence: it allows man, that is, to perceive the immediate, un- certain, problematic and thus dreadful psychic or historical present of Dasein as a necessary part of a linear design, as a causal link between the past and/or future determined from a rational end. The one thing needful to fill the gaps between apparent discontinuities in both the internal and external worlds (i.e., memory and history) or, another way of putting it, to apprehend and to exploit this comforting linear design behind the absurd and dislocating or, better, dis-lodging appearances, is a careful, "objective" observer of the uniformity among diverse phenomena, i.e., the positivistic scientist or, what is the same thing, the behaviorist psychoanalyst. According to the implications of existential philosophy, then, the problem-solution perspective of the "straightforward" Western man of action, as Dostoevsky's denizen of the underground calls the exponents of the Crystal Palace, has its ground in more than merely a belief in the sus- ceptibility of nature to rational explanation. It is based, rather on a mono- lithic certainty that immediate psychic or historical experience is part of a comforting, even exciting and suspenseful well-made cosmic drama or novel -- more particularly, a detective story (the French term is polici're) in the manner of Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue or Conan Doyle s The Hound of the Baskervilles. For just as the form of the detective story has its source in the comforting certainty that an acute "eye," private or otherwise, can solve the crime with resounding finality by inferring causal relationships between clues which point to it (they are "leads," suggesting the primacy of rigid linear narrative sequence), so the "form" of the well- made positivistic universe is grounded in the equally comforting certainty that the scientist and/or psychoanalyst can solve the immediate problem by the inductive method, a process involving the inference of relationships between discontinuous "facts" that point to or lead straight to an explan- ation of the "mystery," the "crime" of contingent existence. "'This is most important,' said [Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles]. .... 'It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex 150</page><page sequence="5">affair. Far from being arbitrary, this way of defining the structure of consciousness into which modern Western man has coerced his humanistic inheritance from the Renaissance is, as we shall see, amply justified, espe- cially by the evidence of his popular arts and public-political life. Though, on the whole, scientists and psychologists no longer are inclined to view existence in this rigidly positivistic and deterministic way, it is nevertheless this structure of consciousness, which assumes the universe, the "book of nature," to be a well-made cosmic drama, that determines the questions and thus the expectations and answers -- in language and in action -- of the "silent majority," das Man of the modern technological City and of the political executors of its will. II As the profound influence of certain kinds of literature on exis- tential philosophy suggests, the impulse of the Western writer to refuse to fulfill causal expectations, to refuse to provide "solutions" for the "crime" of existence, historically precedes the existential critique of Westernism. We discover it in, say, Euripides' Orestes, Shakespeare's problem plays, the tragi-comedies of the Jacobeans, Wycherley's The Plain Dealer, Dickens's Edwin Drood, and more recently in Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilych, Dostoevsky's Notes from Underqround, Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi Kafka's The Trial, Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, and even in T.S. Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes. (These are works, it is worth observing, the radical temporality of which does not yield readily to the spatial meth- odology of the New Criticism, which has its source in the iconic art of Symbolist modernism.) In Notes from Underqround, for example, Dos- toevsky as editor "concludes" this anti-novel: The "notes" of this paradoxalist do not end here. How- ever, he could not resist and continued them. But it also seems to me that we may stop here. Fully conscious of the psychological need of the "straightforward" Gentle- man of the hyper-Westernized St. Petersburg -- the "most intentional city in the whole world" -- Dostoevsky refuses to transform the discordant experience of this terrible voice into a "sublime and beautiful," that is, "straightforward" and distancing story. So also in Six Characters in Search of an Author. Seeking relief from the agony of their ambiguous relation- ships, the characters express their need to give artistic shape to the "infinite absurdities" of their lives. But when the Director (I want to emphasize the 151</page><page sequence="6">coercive implications of the word) -- who hates their authorless, i.e., incon- clusive drama ("it seems to me you are trying to imitate the manner of a certain author whom I heartily detest") -- tries to make a well-made play, a melodrama in the manner of Eughne Scribe or Alexander Dumas fils of their dreadful experience ("What we've got to do is to combine and group up all the facts in one simultaneous close-knit action"), they refuse to be coerced into that comforting but fraudulent "arrangement." Similarly in Sweeney Agonistes, just as Sweeney will not allow his anxious listeners to package the terrible "anti-Aristotelian" murder story he tells them ("Well here again that don't apply / But I've gotta use words when I talk to you"), so Eliot in his great anti-detective play will not allow his audience of middle class fugitives to fulfill their positivistically conditioned need to experience the explanatory and cathartic conclusion. Rather, like Dostoevsky, he ends the play inconclusively with the dreadful knocking at the door. But in each of these earlier works, one has the feeling that the writer has only reluctantly resisted the conventional ending. It is actually the unconscious pressure of the powerfully felt content -- the recognition and acknowledgment of contingency, or what I prefer to call the onto- logical invasion -- that has driven him into undermining the traditional Aris- totelian dramatic or fictional form. The existential diagnosis and critique of the humanistic tradition had not yet emerged to suggest the formal im- plications of metaphysical disintegration. Only after the existentialist phil- osophers revealed that the perception of the universe as a well-made fic- tion, obsessive to the Western consciousness, is in reality a self-deceptive effort to evade the anxiety of contingent existence by objectifying and taking hold of "it," did it become clear to the modern writer that the end- ing-as-solution is the literary agency of this evasive objectification. And it is the discovery of the "anti-formal" imperatives of absurd time for fiction and drama and poetry (though poetry, which in our time means lyric poetry, as Sartre has said in What is Literature?, tends by its natural amen- ability to spatialization to be non-historical) that constitutes the most dynamic thrust of the contemporary Western literary imagination and dif- ferentiates the new from Symbolist modernism. Taking their lead from the existentialists, the postmodern absurd- ists -- writers like the Sartre of Nausea and No Exit, the Beckett of Watt and the Molloy trilogy as well as Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and Krapp's Last Tape (the titles should not be overlooked), lonesco, Genet, Pinter, Frisch, Sarraute, Pynchon, etc. -- thus view the well-made play or novel (la pibce bien faite), the post-Shakespearian allotrope of the Aristotelian form, as the inevitable analogue of the well-made positivistic universe de- lineated by the post-Renaissance humanistic structure of consciousness. More specifically, they view the rigid deterministic plot of the well-made 152</page><page sequence="7">fiction, like that of its metaphysical counterpart, as having its source in bad faith. I mean (to appropriate the metaphor Heidegger uses to remind us of the archetypal flight of the Apollonian Orestes from the Erinyes) the self-deceptive effort of the "fallen 'they'" (das verfallene "Man") "to flee in the face of death" and the ominous absurd by finding objects for the dread of Nothing, that is, by imposing coercively a distancing and tran- guillizing ending or telos from the beginning on the invading contingencies of existence. What Roquentin says in Sartre's Nausea about I'aventure (which is the aesthetic equivalent of the Bouville merchants' arrogant posi- tivism -- their certain "right to exist") in distinguishing it from la vie is precisely what the postmodern absurdists seem to imply in their "de-com- posed" drama and fiction about the modern humanistic structure of con- sciousness and its metaphysical and aesthetic paradigms: . . . everything changes when you tell about life [ra- conte la vie: Sartre seems to be pointing here to the relationship between the mathematical associations of the etymology and the concept of story or well-made plot and, ultimately, the re-counting of existence from the vantage point of the end]; it's a change no one notices: . . . Things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: "It was a fine autumn evening in 1922. I was a notary clerk in Marommes." And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning. "I was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles." This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other [as in life], they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: "It was night, the street was deserted." The phrase is cast out negli- 153</page><page sequence="8">gently, it seems superfluous [superflue: an equivalent of de trop, Sartre's term for the condition of man in the primordial realm of existence which is prior to essence]; but we do not let ourselves be caught and put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annuncia- tions, promises, or even that he lives only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure.... I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail. (My emphasis). In short, the postmodern absurdists interpret this obsession for what Roland Barthes, perhaps with Sartre in mind, calls the fiction of "the preterite mode," for the rigidly causal plot of the well-made work of the humanistic tradition, as catering to and thus further hardening the expec- tation of -- and aggravating the need for -- the rational solution generated by the scientific analysis of man-in-the-world. As the reference to the tech- nique of the detective story in the passage from Nausea suggests, these expectations demand the kind of fiction and drama that achieves its ab- solute fulfillment in the utterly formularized clock-work certainties of plot in the innumerable detective drama series -- Perry Mason, The FBI, Hawaii 5-0, Mannix, Mission Impossible, etc. -- which use up, or rather, "kill," prime television time. Ultimately they also demand the kind of social and political organization that finds its fulfillment in the imposed certainties of the well-made world of the totalitarian state, where investigation or inquisition in behalf of the achievement of a total, that is, pre-ordained or teleologically determined structure -- a "final solution" -- is the defining activity. It is, therefore, no accident that the paradigmatic archetype of the postmodern literary imagination is the anti-detective story (and its anti- psychoanalytical analogue), the formal purpose of which is to evoke the impulse to "detect" and/or to psychoanalyze in order to violently frustrate it by refusing to solve the crime (or find the cause of the neurosis). I am referring, for example, to works like Kafka's The Trial, T.S. Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes (subtitled significantly Fragments of an Aristophanic Melo- drama), Graham Greene's Brighton Rock, Arthur Koestler's Arrival and Departure, Beckett's Watt and Molloy (especially the Moran section), lonesco's Victims of Duty, Robbe-Griliet's The Erasers, and Nathalie Sar- raute's Portrait of a Man Unknown (which Sartre, in his characteristically 154</page><page sequence="9">seminal way, refers to as an "anti-novel that reads like a detective story" and goes on to characterize as "a parody on the novel of 'quest' into which the author has introduced a sort of impassioned amateur detective" who "doesn't find anything . . . and gives up the investigation as a result of a metamorphosis; just as though Agatha Christie's detective, on the verge of unmasking the villain, had himself suddenly turned criminal"). In Victims of Duty, for example, the Detective, like Sherlock Holmes, is certain in the beginning that "everything hangs together, every- thing can be comprehended in time" and thus "keeps moving forward ... one step at a time, tracking down the extraordinary": "Mallot, with a t at the end, or Mallod with a d." Holmes, of course, eventually gets his man (though the foregone certainty, especially of the monstrous evilness of the criminal, should not obscure the grimness of the metaphor that character- izes Conan Doyle's fictional and real universe): "This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare swear that before tomorrow he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!" But the Detective in the process of lonesco's play cannot make Choubert "catch hold of" the elusive Mallot. Despite his brutal efforts to "plug the gaps [of his wayward memory] " by stuffing food down his throat, what he "finds" is only the bottomless hole of Choubert's being: that is, Nothing. And so, instead of ending with "A Retrospective" that ties everything to- gether (clarifies the mystery) as in The Hound of the Baskervilles, Victims of Duty "ends" in verbal, formal and, analogously, ontological disintegra- tion. The disturbing mystery still survives the brutal coercion. What I am suggesting is that it was the recognition of the ulti- mately "totalitarian" implications of the Western structure of conscious- ness -- of the expanding analogy that encompasses art, politics, and meta- physics in the name of the security of rational order -- that compelled the postmodern imagination to undertake the deliberate and systematic subversion of plot -- the beginning, middle, and end structure -- which has enjoyed virtually unchallenged supremacy in the Western literary imagin- ation ever since Aristotle or, at any rate, since the Renaissance interpreters of Aristotle claimed it to be the most important of the constitutive ele- ments of literature. In the familiar language of Aristotle's Poetics then, the postmodern strategy of de-composition exists to generate rather than to purge pity and terror; to disintegrate, to atomize rather than to create a community. In the more immediate language of existentialism, it exists to generate anxiety or dread: to dislodge the tranquillized individual from the "at-home of publicness," from the domesticated, the scientifically charted and organized familiarity of the totalized world, to make him ex- 155</page><page sequence="10">perience what Roquentin sees from the top of a hill overlooking the not so "solid, bourgeois city," Bouville: They come out of their offices after their day of work, they look at the houses and the squares with satisfaction, they think it is their city, a good, solid, bourgeois city. They aren't afraid, they feel at home. . . . They have proof, a hundred times a day, that everything happens mechanically, that the world obeys fixed, unchangeable laws. In a vacuum all bodies fall at the same rate of speed, the public park is closed at 4 p.m. in winter, at 6 p.m. in summer, lead melts at 335 degrees centigrade. ... And all this time, great, vague nature has slipped into their city, it has infiltrated everywhere, in their house, in their office, in themselves. It doesn't move, it stays quietly and they are full of it inside, they breathe it, and they don't see it, they imagine it to be outside, twenty miles from the city. I see it, I see this nature. ... I know that its obedience is idleness, I know it has no laws: what they take for constancy is only habit and it can change tomorrow. What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing? Then they would notice it was there and they'd think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their dykes, bul- warks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them? This aesthetic of decomposition is not, as is too often protested, a purely negative one. For the depaysment -- the ejection from one's "home- land" -- as lonesco calls it after Heidegger, which is effected by the care- fully articulated discontinuities of absurdist literary form, reveals the Ur._r- grund, the primordial not-at-home, where dread, as Kierkegaard and Hei- degger and Sartre and Tillich tell us, becomes not just the agency of despair but also and simultaneously of hope, that is, of freedom and infinite pos- sibility: [If] a man were a beast or an angel [Kierkegaard, echoing Pascal, writes in The Concept of Dreadl , he would not be able to be in dread. Since he is a synthesis he can be in dread, and the greater the dread, the greater the man. And no Grand Inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has dread, and no spy knows how to attack 156</page><page sequence="11">more artfully the man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest, nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and ensnared as dread knows how, and no sharpwitted judge knows how to interrogate, to ex- amine the accused, as dread does, which never lets him escape, neither by diversion nor by noise, neither at work nor at play, neither by day nor by night. Dread is the possibility of freedom. Only this dread is by the aid of faith absolutely educative, lavinq bare as it does all finite aims and discovering all their deceptions. ... He who is educated by dread is educated by possibility, and only the man who is educated by pos- sibility is educated in accordance with his infinity. (My emphasis.) Thus on the psychological level too this dislodgement not only undermines the confident positivistic structure of consciousness that really demands answers it already has (i.e., the expectation of catharsis). It also compels the new self to ask, like Orestes or Job -- the Job who, against the certain advice of his comforters, the advocates of the Law, "spoke of God that which is right" -- the ultimate, the authentically humanizing questions: die Seinfragen, as Heidegger puts it. To evoke the buried metaphor I have hinted at in the passage from The Concept of Dread, the postmodern anti- literature of the absurd exists to strip its audience of positivized fugitives of their protective garments of rational explanation and leave them standing naked and unaccommodated -- poor, bare, forked animals -- before the en- croaching Nothingness. Here, to add another dimension to the metaphor, in the precincts of their last evasions, in the realm of silence, where the language that objectifies (clothes), whether the syntax of plot or of sen- tence, as Sweeney says, "don't apply" (is seen to be mere noise), they must choose authentically (eigentlich: in the context of the naked my-ownness of death and Nothingness) whether to capitulate to Nothingness, to endure it (this is what Tillich calls the courage to be in the face of despair), to affirm the Somethingness of Nothingness "by virtue of the absurd," or to risk letting Being be. It is this metaphor of divestment and silence, which finds its most forceful pre-modern expression in such works as King Lear Fear and Trembling, Crime and Punishment, and The Death of Ivan Ilych, that gives postmodern anti-novels and anti-plays like Sartre's Nausea and No Exit, lonesco's Victims of Duty; Tardieu's The Keyhole (La Serrure); Beckett's Watt and Molloy; Genet's The Maids; Pinter's The Homecoming and Sarraute's Tropisms their special ambience. 157</page><page sequence="12">Ill We have seen during the twentieth century the gradual emergence of an articulate minority point of view -- especially in the arts -- that inter- prets Western technological civilization as a progress not towards the Uto- pian polls idealized by the Greeks, but towards a rationally mass produced City which, like the St. Petersburg of Dostoevsky's and Tolstoy's novels, is a microcosm of universal madness. This point of view involves a growing recognition of one of the most significant paradoxes of modern life: that in the pursuit of order the positivistic structure of consciousness, having gone beyond the point of equilibrium, generates radical imbalances in nature which are inversely proportional to the intensity with which it is coerced. However, it has not been able to call the arrogant anthropomor- phic Western mind and its well-made universe into serious question. As I have suggested, this is largely because the affirmative formal strategy of Symbolist modernism was one of religio-aesthetic withdrawal from existential time into the eternal simultaneity of essential art. The Symbolist movement, that is, tried to deconstruct language, to drive it out of its traditional temporal orbit -- established by the humanistic commit- ment to kinesis and utility and given its overwhelming socio-literary auth- ority, as Marshall McLuhan has shown, by the invention of the printing press -- in order to achieve iconic or, more inclusively, spatial values. Its purpose was to undermine its utilitarian functionr in order to disintegrate the reader's linear-temporal orientation and to make him see synchronically -- as one sees a painting or a circular mythological paradigm -- what the temporal words express. In other words, its purpose was to reveal (in the etymological sense of "unveil") the whole and by so doing raise the reader above the messiness or, as Yeats calls the realm of existence in "Phases of the Moon," "that raving tide," into a higher and more permanent reality. This impulse to transcend the historicity of the human condition in the "allatonceness" (the term is McLuhan's) of the spatialized work of Symbolist literary art is brought into remarkably sharp focus when one perceives the similarity between the poetic implicit in W.B. Yeats's "Sail- ing to Byzantium" with Stephen Dedalus's aesthetic of stasis in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which has often been taken, especially by the New Critics, as a theoretical definition of modern Symbolist literary form: You see I use the word arrest. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire and loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to some- 158</page><page sequence="13">thing; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from some- thing. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. O sages standing in God's holy fire As in the gold mosaic of a wall, Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre, And be the singing-masters of my soul. Consume my heart away; sick with desire And fastened to a dying animal It knows not what it is; and gather me Into the artifice of eternity. Once out of nature I shall never take My bodily form from any natural thing, But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make Of hammered gold and gold enamelling To keep a drowsy Emperor awake; Or set upon a golden bough to sing To lords and ladies of Byzantium Of what is past, or passing, or to come. For Stephen, growing up has been a terrible process of discovering the paradox that the City -- for Plato, for Virgil, for Augustine, for Just- inian, for Dante, for Plethon, for Campanella, the image of beauty, of order, of repose -- has become in the modern world the space of radical ugliness and disorder. To put it in Heidegger's terms, it has been a process of discov- ering that the at-home of the modern world has in fact become the realm of the not-at-home. This process, that is, has been one of dislocation. Thus for Stephen the ugliness and disorder, the "squalor" and "sordidness," that assault his sensitive consciousness after his "Ptolemaic" universe (which he diagrams on the fly-leaf of his geography book) has been utterly shattered during the catastrophic and traumatic Christmas dinner, is primarily or, at any rate, ontologically, a matter of random motion: He sat near them [his numerous brothers and sisters] at the table and asked where his father and mother were. One answered: -- Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro 159</page><page sequence="14">houseboro. Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often.... He asked: -- Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question? The sister answered: -- Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro will- boro putboro usboro outboro.... He waited for some moments, listening [to the children sing "Oft in the Stilly Night"], before he too took up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the overtones of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. Even before they set out on life's jour- ney they seemed weary already of the way. ... All seemed weary of life even before enter- ing upon it. And he remembered that Newman had heard this note also in the broken line of Virgil.giving utter- ance, like the voice of Nature herself, to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the experience of her children in every time. (Walter Pater too had heard this sad Virgilian note and in quoting the pas- sage in Marius the Epicurean, another novel having its setting in a disinte- grating world, established the nostalgia for rest as the essential motive of the aesthetic movement in England.) Seen in the light of his discovery that random motion is the radi- cal category of modern urban life -- that existence is prior to essence, which the postmodern writer will later present as the Un-Naming in the Garden- City -- Stephen's well-known aesthetic or rather (to clarify what persistent critical reference to Stephen's "aesthetic" has obscured) his iconic poetics of stasis, both its volitional ground and its formal character, becomes clear. He wants, like T.E. Hulme, like Proust, like Virginia Woolf and like most other Symbolists, a poetry the iconic -- and autotelic -- nature of which arrests the mind -- neutralizes the anguish, the schism in the spirit -- and raises it above desire and loathing, which is to say, the realm of radical motion, of contingency, of historicity, in the distancing moment when the whole is seen simultaneously. The "epiphanic" -- one is tempted to say "Oriental" -- nature of this iconic poetic is further clarified in Stephen's amplification of the prin- ciple of stasis in terms of Saint Thomas's "ad pulcritudinem tria rauir- 160</page><page sequence="15">untur, integritas, consonantia, claritas" especially the first and, above all, the most important third categories. Integritas or "wholeness," Stephen observes, is the apprehension of "a bounding line drawn about the object" no matter whether it is in space or in time: ". . . temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and self- contained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. You apprehend it as one thing. You see it as one whole." Conson- antia or "harmony" is the apprehension of the "rhythm of its structure"; the feeling that "it is a thing," "complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of parts, the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious." Fin- ally, and most important for Stephen, claritas or "radiance" (the etymology of his translation -- 1radiance" is the light emitted in rays from a center or logos -- and his analysis of the term clearly suggest its relation with revela- tion) is the apprehension of "that thing which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which [Saint Thomas] speaks is the scholastic quidditas, the whatness of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination .... The instant where- in that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony in the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure. .. ." (My emphasis) So also in "Sailing to Byzantium" -- though the metaphysical con- text is more ontological than social in orientation -- Yeats's speaker, like Stephen, is articulating, both in the content and form of the poem, an iconic poetic that has its source in an impulse for epiphanic transcendence -- what Wilhelm Worringer (the proponent of primitive and oriental, in- cluding Byzantine, artistic models who influenced T.E. Hulme) in Abstrac- tion and Empathy calls the "urge to abstraction." As fully, if more im- plicitly, conscious of the paradoxical horror of the modern Western City as Stephen, the poet has come to the City of the iconic imagination -- the City of Phase 15 -- to pray his mosaic models to teach him an art of poetry that will "consume my heart away" -- a heart like Stephen's which, "sick with desire / And fastened to a dying animal / . . . knows not what it is." Such a heart is ignorant because, as Yeats says here and reiterates in in- numerable ways throughout his early and middle poetry, its immediate relationship to history makes everything appear to be random motion, that is, absurd. Clearly, to continue with the phenomenological language of existentialism, this heart is a synecdoche for the dislodged and thus anguish- ridden man-in-the-world, the alienated man in the dreadful realm of das Unheimliche. And, as in Stephen's iconic poetic, Yeats's moment of con- summation (the parallel with "radiance" should not be overlooked) which negates the human heart and neutralizes (arrests) desire -- the Western, the 161</page><page sequence="16">empathetic urge "to possess, to go to something" -- is the consummation of the creative act, the metamorphosis of kinesis into stasis, becoming into being, the uncertain temporal life into assured iconic artifact, "selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it." (Similarly, the image of a Byzantine mosaic Panaghia or Saint is sharply articulated upon a depthless and vast gold space that sug- gests the absolute purity of eternity.) Like Stephen's "instant" of "lum- inous silent stasis," Yeats's moment of consummation is thus the distancing moment when all time can be seen simultaneously. Whereas the real birds of the first stanza -- "those dying generations" -- know not what they are because they are "caught" in time, the poet in this moment of consum- mation, having assumed the form "as Grecian goldsmiths make / Of ham- mered gold and gold enamelling," can sing in full knowledge from a per- spective beyond or "out of nature" of the world below, which is to say, of history seen all at once, i.e., spatially: Of what is past, or passing, or to come. In the words that Yeats's myth or rather his "sacred book" insists on, this burning moment, like that of Joyce's "priest of the eternal imagination," and of so many other Symbolist poets and novelists, is, in Ortega's term, the "dehumanizing" epiphanic moment of transcendence. IV Committed to an iconic poetic of transcendence, the literature of early modernism thus refused to engage itself in the history of modern man. Though it was able to reveal the squalor of the "Unreal City" of the West, where, as one of T.S. Eliot's Thames daughters puts it, "I can connect / Nothing with nothing," and even point with Dickens and Dostoevsky to the ontological invasion that had already begun, it did not challenge the positivistic structure of consciousness which organizes and sustains it. De- spite, therefore, the terrible lessons of World War I and again World War II, especially of the genocidal holocaust perpetrated in the name of "the final solution," it is still the positivistic frame of reference that determines the questions-and-answers, that delineates the Western image of the universe and creates Western man's values. From the governing bodies and the scientific-industrial-military complex and even our educational and religious institutions to the so-called hard hat and blue collar workers, it is this well- made world, the world pointing toward a materialist utopia, toward a Crys- tal Palace end, that appears real. And as Sartre suggests in his assault on les salauds in Nausea and "The Childhood of a Leader," it is the certainty 162</page><page sequence="17">of the rightness of this fictional image of the macrocosm that continues to justify the coercion of the unique and disturbing deviant into its pre-deter- mined role -- or its elimination ("liquidation" or "wasting") -- when it does not fulfill the rigid and inexorable expectations established by a precon- ceived end. Indeed, this world-picture, as a book like Lewis Mumford's The Pentagon of Power suggests, becomes more rigid and inclusive, i.e., totalitarian, in proportion to the irrationality it generates. The investigator and monstrous proliferation: these are the presences of contemporary life. And this is no accident. As I have already suggested, my definition of the Western struc- ture of consciousness as one which perceives the world as a well-made melodrama is not a tour de force of the critical imagination. It is discover- able everywhere in the language and the shape of action of men from all social levels of the Western City. All that is necessary to perceive it is atten- tion. It is impossible in this limited space to support this claim in any de- tail. But perhaps a quotation from an editorial on the subject of literature that appeared some time ago in The Daily News, the New York tabloid with a circulation of over two million, may suggest how rooted and inclu- sive this perspective is: Winner and Still Champ For generations William Shakespeare has been recognized as the greatest English master of the drama, and quite possibly the greatest handler of the English language, that ever yet has trod this earthly ball ... Shakespeare and Dickens had several things in common. They . . . composed stage or fictional pieces which had definite beginnings, unmistakable climaxes and positive endings. Neither Dickens nor Shakespeare wrote so-what tripe that gets nowhere and is in some fashion nowadays. Nor did they glorify characters whom even the ablest of modern psychiatrists couldn't help. End of today's discussion of matters literary. This obsession for the "positive" and comforting ending in the face of Shakespeare's -- and even Dickens' -- disturbing ambiguities, to say nothing of the uncertainties of contingent existence, I submit, lies behind this newspaper's editorial support of all causes "grounded" in a story- book patriotism (such as United States involvement in Vietnam, President 163</page><page sequence="18">Nixon's invasion of Cambodia, Vice-President Agnew's political rhetoric) and vilification of all others "grounded" in story-book treachery (such as the peace movement, senatorial opposition to unilateral policy-making by the executive branch, and even Scandinavian anti-Americanism). More pernicious, because its implications are harder to perceive, this structure of consciousness also lies behind this newspaper's presentation of the news, whether a tenement murder, a campus uprising or an international incident, as sensational melodrama whose problem-solution form not only neutral- izes the reader's anxieties but even makes him a voyeur. To forestall the objection that this evidence is unreliably partisan, let me parenthetically refer to the parallel with, say, Time or Newsweek, where the narrative structure of every article is conceived as a well-made fiction, that is, writ- ten -- manipulated -- from the end. Further, as even the most cursory examination of "The Pentagon Papers" clearly suggests, this positivistic structure of consciousness also lies behind the actions that constitute the news. It has governed the United States' involvement in Vietnam from the overthrow of Diem, the Tonkin Bay incident, and the ensuing large scale "retaliatory" bombing of North Vietnam to the Vietnamization -- which means the Americanization or rather the Westernization -- of Vietnam. It is, then, no accident that every- where in these secret documents the Southeast Asian situation is seen by their American authors as a problem to be solved; that the planning to solve the problem -- to achieve conclusive American objectives -- is referred to in the metaphor of plotting a scenario; that the execution -- the acting out - of the scenario in this recalcitrant theater of operations is to be ac- complished, first, by the CIA -- the international detective agency whose job it is to coerce the reality under investigation to conform to a precon- ceived order -- and, then, by the military arm by way of a massive assault on the "criminal" enemy. In short, what emerges in these disturbing docu- ments, if we pay critical attention to the language (especially to its trite metaphors), is an image of an action in which virtually everyone involved in this terrible human disaster -- from the executive branch and its councils to the intelligence agencies and the military and the American press and its public -- speaks and acts as if he is playing a role in a well-made fiction in the utterly dehumanized mode of a play by Eugbne Scribe, a novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, or closest of all, an episode of Mission Impossible. I will refer specifically to only one concrete but representative action of the war in Vietnam: the large scale interservice rescue operation staged against the Son Tay prisoner-of-war camp in North Vietnam in December, 1970. Seen in the light of my discussion, this melodramatic action constitutes an illuminating paradigm not only of the war that Amer- ica has been waging against Southeast Asia since 1954, but also -- and more 164</page><page sequence="19">fundamentally, for it is not so much politics as ontology that concerns me here -- of the war that the West has been waging against the world, indeed against Nature itself, ever since the seventeenth century. It reveals, that is, how embedded -- how located -- in the Western consciousness is the meta- phor of the well-made universe and how intense the conditioned psychol- ogical need behind it. This elaborately plotted action, the "scenario" of which, according to the New York Times report, "was rehearsed for a month in a stage-set replica of the objective on the Florida Gulf Coast," did not achieve its objective, i.e., did not end, because, despite the split second timing with which all the roles were acted out, there was no one there to rescue at the climactic moment. "It was like hollering in an empty room," one of the bewildered actors in this dreadful experience put it. "When we realized that there was no one in the compound," said another -- his language should be marked well -- "I1 had the most horrible feeling of my life." And Time summed up in language that unintentionally recalls Watt's agonized quest for or rather his futile effort to take hold of the elusive Knott in Beckett's novel: "All the courage, the long training, the perfectly executed mission, had come to naught." Despite these revelatory glimpses into the horror, the Secretary of Defense was driven to declare reiteratively in the following days that the Son Tay affair was a successfully completed operation. It is this meta- morphosis of the absurd into manageable object, into fulfilled objective, into an accomplishment, which is especially revealing. For the obvious incommensurability between the assertion of successful completion and the absurd and dreadful non-end constitutes a measure of the intensity of the need that the power complex and the people that depend on it feel for definite conclusions. Returning to the ontological level, it is a measure of modern Western man's need to take hold of the Nothing that despite, or perhaps because of, his technics is crowding in on him. To put it in the central metaphor of the existential imagination, it is the measure of his need to flee from the Furies of the not-at-home and its implications for freedom. V In the past decade or so there have emerged a variety of "post- modern" modes of writing and critical thought that, despite certain resem- blances to aspects of the existential imagination, are ultimately extensions of early iconic modernism. I am referring, for example, to the structuralist criticism of Roland Barthes, the phenomenological criticism of conscious- ness of Georges Poulet and Jean-Pierre Richard, and the neo-lmagism of Marshall McLuhan; the "field poetry" of Charles Olson and the concrete 165</page><page sequence="20">poetry of Pierre Garnier, Ferdinand Kriwet, and Franz Mon; the roman nouveau of Robbe-Grillet and Michel Butor; the "Happenings" of Allan Kaprow and Claes Oldenburg; and the Pop Art literature advocated by critics such as Leslie Fiedler (who, it is worth observing, wants to reconcile the sensibilities of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Stephen Foster with those of the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, etc., all of whom have in common not only the clich6s and the assertive end rhymes he admires for their expression of childlike innocence, but also, and in a way at the source of these characteristics, the desire to go home again: the nostalgia for the hearth). These modes of creativity and critical speculation attest to the variety of the postmodern scene, but this pluralism has also tended to hide the fact that, in tendency, they are all oriented beyond history or, rather, they all aspire to the spatialization of time. As a result the exis- tential sources of the primary thrust of the postmodern literary imagination have been obscured, thus jeopardizing the encouraging post-World War II impulse to recover the temporality of the literary medium from the plastic arts, which is to say, to engage literature in an ontological dialogue with the world in behalf of the recovery of the authentic historicity of modern man. Seen in this light, the "Pentagon Papers" not only emerge as a stark reminder that the totalizing structure of consciousness of the "straight- forward" Gentlemen who built the modern City continues to coerce his- tory with missionary certainty into well-made fictions. Because they re- semble so closely the kind of fiction and drama associated with the rise of science, technology, and middle class culture in the nineteenth century, they also emerge as a paradigm capable of teaching both the contemporary writer and critic a great deal about the Western mind and the popular arts and the media that nourish it. In so doing, finally, they suggest a way of discriminating between modernisms and of clarifying the direction that the main impulse of the postmodern sensibility has taken and, I think, should continue to take in the immediate future. Ultimately, one would like a literature of generosity, a literature, like Chaucer's or Shakespeare's or Dickens' or George Eliot's or Tolstoy's, that acknowledges, indeed celebrates, the "messiness" of existence, as Iris Murdoch puts it, in the context of discovered form. But at the moment, Western man as a cultural community or rather public is simply incapable or responding to the generosity -- the humane impulse, having its source in the humility of acknowledged uncertainty, to let Being be -- that, on occasion, infuses Shakespeare's stage and his world as stage. (As the edit- orial quoted above suggests, the ungenerous effort of the "Enlightenment" to rewrite the "endings" of Shakespeare's "inconclusive" plays continues down to the present, though it takes the form of accepting the rewritten 166</page><page sequence="21">version as myth while the plays themselves are locked up in university libraries.) For, to put the point in the familiar language of the historical critical debate, unlike the Western past, when Art (The Odyssey, for ex- ample) was justifiably a taxonomic model for ordering a brutal and terrify- ing Nature (existence) or a mode of psychological consolation in the face of its catastrophic power, the Western present, as the "Pentagon Papers" and the Son Tay "scenario" and the Mission Impossible series and The Daily News and Time suggest, is a time that bears witness to a Nature whose brutal and terrifying forces have been coerced -- and domesticated -- into a very well-made and therefore very dangerous work of Art. The Western structure of consciousness is bent, however inad- vertently, on unleashing chaos in the name of the order of a well-made world. If this is true, contemporary literature cannot afford the luxury of the Symbolist, or, as I prefer to call it, the iconic literary aesthetic nor of its "postmodern" variants. For ours is no time for psychic flights, for Dedalean "seraphic embraces," however enticing they may be. Neither, for that matter, despite its more compelling claim as an authentic possib- ility, can it afford the luxury of the aesthetic implicit in the concept of the later Heidegger's Gelassenheit (that receptivity which might disclose the Being of Not-being and thus the sacramental at-homeness of the not- at-home), the aesthetic of "letting be" or, perhaps, of letting Being be, that Nathan Scott seems to be recommending in his important recent books, Negative Capability and The Wild Prayer of Longing. For, in the mono- lithic well-made world that the positivistic structure of consciousness per- ceives -- and perceiving, creates -- it is the Detective who has usurped the place not only of God but of Being too as the abiding presence and, there- fore, has first to be confronted. Our time calls for an existence-Art, one which, by refusing to resolve discords into the satisfying concordances of a telos, constitutes an assault against an art-ificialized Nature in behalf of the recovery of its pri- mordial terrors. The most immediate task, therefore, in which the con- temporary writer must engage himself -- it is, to borrow a phrase ungrate- fully from Yeats, the most difficult task not impossible -- is that of under- mining the detective-like expectations of the positivistic mind, of unhoming Western man, by evoking rather than purging pity and terror -- anxiety. It must, that is, continue the iconoclastic revolution begun in earnest after World War II to dislodge or, to be absolutely accurate, to dis-occident, the objectified modern Western man, the weighty, the solid citizen, to drive him out of the fictitious well-made world, not to be gathered into the "artifice of eternity," but to be exposed to the existential realm of history, where Nothing is certain. For only in the precincts of our last evasions, where "dread strikes us dumb," only in this silent realm of dreadful un- 167</page><page sequence="22">certainty, are we likely to discover the ontological and aesthetic possibil- ities of generosity. In this image-breaking enterprise, therefore, the contemporary writer is likely to find his "tradition", not in the "anti-Aristotelian" line that goes back from the Concrete poets to Proust, Joyce, the Imagists, Mallarml, Gautier, and Pater, but in the "anti-Aristotelianism" that looks back from Beckett, lonesco, and the Sartre of Nausea and No Exit through the Eliot of Sweeney Agonistes, some of the Surrealists, Kafka, Pirandello, Dostoevsky and the "loose, and baggy monsters" of his countrymen, Dic- kens, Wycherley, and -- with all due respect to the editor of The Daily News -- the Shakespeare of King Lear, Measure for Measure and the ironically entitled All's Well that Ends Well, in which one of the characters says: They say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.
