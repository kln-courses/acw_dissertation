<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 Foreword This list of acquisitions is the third in its series, those for the years 1957 and 1958 having previously appeared in the Journal. The descriptive catalogue has been compiled by Dr. Joseph Raftery, Keeper of Irish Antiquities, who also provides a short account of a Late Bronze Age hoard of gold objects from Derrinboy, Co. Offaly. A note on an interesting stone bowl of Viking affinities from Beginish, Co. Kerry, has been kindly supplied by Professor Michael J. O'Kelly, University College, Cork. During the year the Museum acquired a large number of antiquities in the sale of the effects of the late Henry Naylor, a well-known Dublin antique dealer, and Miss E. Prendergast writes on a group of bronzes from Charleville Forest, Co. Offaly, which formed part of this collection. A preliminary report on a sandhill settlement in Dooey, Co. Donegal, which was investigated by the Museum in 1959, is contributed by the excavators, Messrs. A. B. 6 Riord&amp;in and E. Rynne. Mr. 6 Riordain also contributes a note on a Neolithic vessel from Bracklin, Co. Westmeath; and Mr. Rynne a report on an urn burial at Caltragh, Co. Galway. We wish to express our gratitude to all those persons who assisted the work of the Museum in so many ways during the year under review. Special thanks are due to Lord Talbot de Malahide for the gift of an extensive collection of antiquities, including a number of hitherto unpublished objects from Lagore Crannog, Co. Meath; to Dr. George A. Little for the gift of a number of items, including two interesting bronze pins from Clonmacnoise; and to the officials of Bord na Mona for their continuing help in obtaining articles discovered in the Bord's various works throughout the country. A. T. LUCAS, Director. NEOLITHIC VESSEL FROM BRACKLIN, CO. WESTMEATH In March, 1959, in the course of turf working at Bracklin bog, Co. Westmeath, a decorated pottery vessel was found at a depth of approx imately 3.00 m. below the original bog surface. The discovery was reported to the National Museum and the find-spot was examined by the writer but not before the vessel, which had been found inverted, had been removed by the finders. The vessel (Fig. 1) measures 20.5 cm. in diameter at the mouth and 12.5 cm. in height. It has a round base. Only a small portion of the original rim remains and this appears to have been rounded. The wall of the vessel is 1.7 cm. in average thickness and, for its size, the</page><page sequence="2">44 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND vessel is extremely heavy. Many large mineral grits are incorporated in the core. Externally, the vessel is decorated all over with rows of circular and, in some cases, oval impressions but this ornament has disappeared from some areas owing to damage to the surface. ! i i i Fig. 1.

Realising the nature and importance of the discovery, the finders reported it to the National Museum through Mr. Jarlath Burke, The Herald, Tuam,5 but, unfortunately, not before the lower part of the vessel had been badly broken; otherwise there was no disturbance. 2PR1A 29C, 1911-1912, 311-347, PI.

The upright stones had narrow (some almost pointed) ends, but went no deeper than the flagged floor. The internal measurements of the cist at its bottom were 62 cm. from S.W. to N.E. and 55 cm. from N.W. to S.E. All of the upright stones, except one, were backed by a packing of small rounded stones, averaging under 10 cm. in diameter, and two or three larger, slab-like stones. The exception was the upright stone on the north-eastern side of the cist which was placed directly against the pit wall; this was probably the first stone placed in position by the builders. The capstone rested on the top of only one of these upright stones, that immediately to the south of the stone which was placed against the pit wall. This stone stood 65 cm. high above the top of the flagged floor and, reckoning in a clock-wise direction around the cist from it, the other stones were 55 cm., 50 cm., 40 cm., 50 cm., 50 cm., 50 cm., and 55 cm. high respectively. To bring the tops of these stones up to the level of the highest, smaller slabs were laid horizontally on them. The capstone measured 85 cm. in length by 60 cm. in greatest width and was 25 cm. in maximum thickness. It was irregularly shaped except for its naturally flat underside.6 The pit had been dug to a depth of about 70-80 cm. into the hard, sticky, grey sub-soil. (See plan and section, Fig. 2). Inside the cist, placed in an inverted position on the flagged floor, was a large cinerary urn. This covered a heap of cremated human bones,7 some potsherds, a flint slug-knife, and a bone pin. The lower levels of the bones were considerably blacker and stickier than the rest as if ashes were mixed with them.8 There was a thickness of about 10-12 cm. of fairly homogeneous grey-brown material around the cinerary urn on the bottom of the cist, particularly on the western side where there was the widest gap between the upright stones. (See section, Fig. 2). The cinerary urn (Reg. No. 1959: 2; Fig. 3) is of coarse, poorly fired ware containing large grits,9 with walls averaging 1.5 cm. in thick ness. Originally about 39 cm. high, it is 36.5 cm. in diameter at the rim and about 12 cm. at the base. The internal bevel of the rim is 6Dr. J. S. Jackson, Keeper, Natural History Division, National Museum, identified a sample of the capstone as " crinoidal limestone of Carboniferous age." The other cist-stones appeared to have been of the same material. 7Reg. No. 1959: 5A. Kindly examined by Prof. E. Keenan, Dept. of Anatomy, U.C.D., who comments: "Cremated fragmented human skeletal remains of at least one adult and a young child (7-10 years). Owing to the fragmented and warped condition of the bones, it is not possible to estimate stature, age or sex." 8No charcoal was found, but some of the black material, which was also adhering to the inside of the rim of the Cinerary Urn, was identified by Dr. Jackson as " soot encrustation." 9Dr. Jackson identified the grits as "Crystalline Calcite, probably associated with mineralised cavities in local limestone."</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 47 decorated with two horizontal rows of impressed comb ornament forming a line of herring-bone pattern 3 cm. wide. The outer surface has three main horizontal zones of ornament covering the upper 14.5 cm. of the vessel. The top 2.5 cm. has a row of tripartite zig-zags executed in impressed comb technique. Below this there is a 6 cm. wide band of scored linear ornament, consisting of alternately inverted triangles filled with diagonal lines. The third zone consists of two rows of comb impressed herring-bone ornament, each about 2.5 cm. wide. The sherds (Reg.

Most of the sherds are small and none could be joined. All were of finer and better-fired pottery than that of the large cinerary urn and they average about 1 cm. in thickness. Three larger pieces could be assembled and there was also one large rim sherd. No base sherds were found. The large rim sherd (Fig. 4, A) is slightly everted and its interior surface is decorated with</page><page sequence="6">48 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND a row, 3 cm. wide, of lightly scored diagonal lines. The flat rim is decorated with deeply impressed radial lines. The upper 7 cm. of the vessel is decorated with four irregular horizontal rows of deep crescentic, "thumb-nail" impressions. The vessel seems to have been a large urn which would originally have been about 22.5 cm. in diameter at the rim. One of the other large fragments (Fig. 4, B), probably from the widest part of the same vessel, has a horizontal row of scored herring Fig. 4. Bronze Age burial, Caltragh, Co. Galway.

Below the lowest of these rows the ends of scored diagonal lines are noticeable. Two other large fragments, probably from the wall of the same vessel, have scored, linear ornament. Unfor tunately, neither of these shows a complete design but it would appear that the ornamentation consisted of a band of large inverted triangles filled with diagonal lines (Fig. 4, C).</page><page sequence="7">Plate V] [To face page 48 m;f^.. . . .. - - \ --- GOLD HOARD, DERRINBOY, CO.

It is 7.5 cm. long and 2.4 cm. and 5.5 mm. in maximum width and thickness respectively. One of its ends is more pointed than the other. The convex surface has been secondarily worked all over. This object shows signs of having been subjected to intense heat, suggesting that it may have accompanied the corpse during the cremation rites.10 The small bone pin which was found among the cremated bones (Reg. No. 1959: 5; Fig. 5) was also burnt and may likewise have accom panied the corpse during the cremation. Portion of its head, which probably was originally crutch-shaped, is now missing, as also is the extreme point of the round-sectioned stem. Now 5.3 cm. long, the pin was probably originally about 5 mm. longer. The stem curves sideways in the same plane as the head. When viewed from above the head must D \ Fig. 5. Bone pin, Caltragh, Co. Galway. have been oval in outline, about 1.3 cm. by 5 mm. in greatest length and breadth. It is 5 mm. thick and is grooved around its girth thus dividing it into two segments. The pin appears to have, been polished. 10Concerning it Dr. Jackson writes: "The material used in this artifact is chal cedonic silica, probably flint, in which small perforated spicules are not uncommon and probably represent the megascleres of fossil sponges. The surface has been extensively modified by heat and has taken on a haphazardly crazed pattern. Vitrification has only occurred to a limited extent and the surface is not glazed. Approximately two-thirds of the surface is of a lead-grey colour and the cause of this is apparently associated with the burning. The colouration is superficial, ex tending only 0.1-0.2 mm. below the surface, and yet the pigmentation and surface are sufficiently vitrified to render the colour irremovable with a steel point." D</page><page sequence="10">50 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND Discussion11 In Ireland, the relatively rare circular cist composed of several upright stones appears to be associated predominantly with cremated burials and with vessels of the cinerary urn class. Good examples of this include Clonshannon, Co. Wicklow, where three polygonal cists containing cinerary urns of various types and a pigmy vessel were found;12 Agower, Co. Wicklow, where an encrusted urn was found in a roughly circular cist formed of seven upright slabs;13 Ballinlyna Upper, Co. Limerick, where an ovoid cist of seven uprights contained an encrusted urn;14 Kilmashogue, Co. Dublin, where a circular cist formed of eight uprights and containing a cinerary urn was inserted secondarily in the ante-chamber of a Wedge-type megalithic tomb.15 An example containing three food-vessels of Bowl type is, however, known from the multiple-burial mound at Corrower, Co. Mayo;16 one from Fassaroe, Co. Wicklow, which produced two small unburnt chips of flint but no pottery,17 and one formed of seventeen upright stones from Hempstown Commons, Co. Kildare, whic^ contained an unburnt crouched burial but no grave-goods.18 The last had a decorated capstone and was dated to early in the Bronze Age by its excavator. Some of the graves in the multiple-cist cairn at Poulawack, Co. Clare, are polygonal, but do not seem to be of the same type as the above, there being, apparently, no attempt to make a rounded cist. One of these, Grave 6, produced a beaker sherd.19 Little can be said about the large cinerary urn, except that its position, inverted over the cremated remains, is characteristic of such vessels in this type of grave and that the comb-impressed ornament is very rare on cinerary urns, Urn 1 from Harristown, Co. Waterford,20 being probably the best Irish example. The sherds discovered among the cremated bones appear to be part of a cinerary urn, the decoration of which included motifs executed in a manner rather reminiscent of a type of ornament known on Carrowkeel and Peterborough ware. The very fragmentary nature of the vessel and the complete absence of base and lower part suggests that this vessel was broken before the burial took place. It is not uncommon to find two or more vessels associated with a single burial. lrlhe writer wishes to thank Mr. B. 6 Riorddin, Irish Antiquities Division, National Museum, for much assistance with this part of the text. i2Mahr and Price, JRSAI, 62 (1932), 75-90. i^Price, JRSAI, 68 (1938), 157-159.

The only other known Irish pin with a segmented head is the somewhat different example found in a stone cist at Corrandrum, Co. Galway, about seven miles distant from Caltragh, which was associated with a vase type Food-Vessel, two flint implements, and a cremated burial. This pin has been compared with bone pins with cylindrical, segmented heads from Iberian chambered tombs of the Chalcolithic Period.22 Dating It has become almost traditional to date cinerary urns to the Late Bronze Age in Ireland and the discovery of such vessels in the circular or oval cists referred to above has been used to date those graves to that period. More recent work on the pottery associations has, however, suggested that such dating may not in all cases be acceptable and, for some burials, a date in the earlier portion of the Bronze Age has been convincingly argued.23 The bone pin from Caltragh, as suggested above, seems to have analogies in the earlier part of the Bronze Age and flint slug knives are generally found in early contexts; the ornament on the sherds found among the bones may also indicate an early dating, although too much reliance should not, perhaps, be placed on this. Taking every thing into consideration, an early date for the Caltragh burial may, therefore, be postulated. ETIENNE RYNNE GROUP OF BRONZES FROM CHARLEVILLE FOREST, CO. OFFALY In 1944 the National Museum acquired a small group of prehistoric bronze objects from an antique dealer in Dublin. These objects were: a palstave, a socketed axehead, a socketed sickle and a socketed gouge. They were said to be from "Charleville Forest Estate" near Tullamore 21Hartnett, JRSAI, 82 (1952), 160. Dr. Jackson commenting on the slug-knife from Caltragh writes: " In an examination of several heat-modified chalcedonic artifacts from other sites I have noticed that those with a high glaze were not crazed whereas those with haphazard crazing were unverified or, at the most, had a sub-vitreous surface. It would appear to me possible, therefore, that the two heat-modified surfaces in question, unverified or semi-vitrified and crazed, on the one hand, and vitrification and glazing without crazing on the other, may be mutually exclusive." 22Chitty, /.

When the residue of the dealer's collection was being dispersed after his death in 1959 three socketed spearheads, labelled "Charleville Forest, Tullamore", were acquired. No further information concerning the group is available. Description of Objects 1944: 266 Palstave. The flanges and stop-ridge, which are wide, form a unit. The latter has the shape of a small pocket. The butt is somewhat damaged, the cutting-edge is convex but not widely splayed. There is no loop. The casting seams have not been completely rubbed down. The only ornament consists of a U-shaped ridge, pendent from the stop-ridge on each broad face. Faulty casting is indicated by the presence on one of the narrow edges of comparatively large flaws. L. 17 cm.; W. at cutting-edge, 6.8 cm., at butt, 2.55 cm.; max. T. (including flanges), 2.6 cm. (Fig. 6: 7). 1944: 267 Socketed axehead. Slender specimen with thin walls. Longitudinal facets produce an octagonal cross-section. The socket-mouth is slightly splayed. Below the rim there is a slightly raised broad band immediately below which the loop is placed. The cutting-edge is splayed and slightly convex. It appears to have been sharpened. A jagged hole on one side of the socket, coupled with an irregularity of profile at the same place, indicates imperfect casting. Casting seams rubbed down. No internal ribs in the socket. L. 9 cm.; W. at cutting-edge, 5.2 cm.; socket mouth, externally, 3.2 cm. by 3.5 cm. (Fig. 6: 5). 1944: 268 Socketed sickle. The mouth of the socket is ovoid, the two narrow ends being flattened. Internally, the socket closes to a point. There are two circular rivet-holes near the rim, the line between them being at right angles to the plane of the implement. From one of the rivet-holes towards the blade the socket is split, due, apparently, to faulty casting. A casting seam is faintly visible on the blade side of the socket. The blade is curved; its cross-section is a pointed oval. Though now blunted, both edges seem originally to have been sharp. L. of blade (excluding socket), 8.3 cm.; W. of blade, 2.3 cm.; max. T. 6 mm.; L. of socket (externally), 6.3 cm.; mouth of socket, 2.7 cm. by 1.9 cm.; D. of rivet-holes, 7 mm. (Fig. 6: 4). 1944: 269 Socketed gouge. Socket round at the mouth, flattening towards the bottom. No rivet-holes. There are two short, narrow ribs on the inside of the socket; these coalesce at the</page><page sequence="14">54 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND bottom. The cutting-edge is slightly convex. Casting seams not visible. L. 7.3 cm.; D. of mouth of socket, 1.8 cm.; W. of cutting-edge, 1.5 cm. (Fig. 6: 6). 1959: 153 Spearhead with loops on socket. In elevation, the loops are rhomboid. The socket runs nearly to the point of the blade; on the external surface it continues to the tip as a stout midrib. The blade is wide for the length of the weapon. It is four-sided: from the tip two bevelled edges with curved outline run in the direction of the socket-mouth; the other two sides, concave and flat, join the ends of the bevelled sides to the sides of the socket. On each side of the blade two ridges run from the socket roughly parallel with the curved edges. L. 10.3 cm.; max. W. of blade, 4.2 cm.; D. of socket mouth, externally, 1.8 cm.; L. of loop, 1.8 cm. (Fig. 6: 3). 1959: 154 Spearhead similar in outline to 153. The flat, concave edges of the blade continue to the loops and are ornamented with transverse notches arranged in groups of three. The rhomboid loops are covered with cross-hatching. Between the ridges on the Made and the socket and continuing the length of the socket to its mouth there are closely-set tiny hammer marks, producing a sort of 'rain pattern'. L. 15.6 cm.; W. of blade, 4.75 cm.; D. of socket-mouth, externally, 2 cm.; L. of loop, 1.9 cm. (Fig. 6: 2). 1959: 155 Socketed spearhead with peg-holes. The socket, which is conical, is not much longer than the narrow, leaf-shaped blade, the edges of which are bevelled and now somewhat gapped. There is a dent on one side of the socket nearer the tip; this has worn through at one point. The casting seams have not been rubbed down. L. 11.3 cm.; max. W. of blade, 3.3 cm.; D. of socket-mouth, externally, 2.4 cm.; D. of peg-holes, 6 mm. (Fig. 6: 1). Comment Due to the lack of particulars of the discovery of this group of bronze objects it is impossible to be certain if they were found in association. Furthermore, the degree of patination varies and for these reasons it might be misleading to regard them as a hoard. The dates of the individual items may range from the middle to the end of the Bronze Age. The palstave may be the earliest object and, as suggested by Evans, the larger looped, kite-shaped spearhead (154) may be as early as 1400 B.C.24 The uneven tapering of the socket on the smaller, looped spearhead is unusual, especially as it is combined with a **UJA 17 (1954), 57-9.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 55 kite-shaped blade. The spearhead with side-holes for shaft attachment (155) is generally regarded as intrusive in the native Irish series at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age.25 Hodges would date socketed axeheads with octagonal cross-section, like the Charleville example, early in the Late Bronze Age.?6 The sickle with a laterally-attached blade seems to be earlier than the type with the blade attached at the end of the socket. Both types belong to the Late Bronze Age but are not as yet dated more closely.27 The final item in the Charleville group, the gouge (1944: 269), dates to the Late Bronze Age but has no feature by which it might be more closely dated within this period.28 Even should the group be a hoard there would be nothing discon certing in the mutual association of the objects and they could all, even the leaf-shaped spearhead, be native productions assembled in the Late Bronze Age. Only a detailed study of the individual types and of their occurrence in related hoards might yield more precise dating. ELLEN PRENDERGAST THE DERRINBOY HOARD, CO. OFFALY During turf-cutting operations in June, 1959, Patrick McGovern of Ballycollin, Kilcormac, Co. Offaly, came across a hoard of metal objects consisting of two gold bracelets, two gold tress rings, a gold necklet and a piece of copper wire. They were found at a reported depth of 13 feet below the surface of the bog in Derrinboy td., Par. Ballyboy, Bar. Ballyboy, Co. Offaly (O.S. 6", Sheet 31). The specimens lay closely together, apparently surrounded by the length of stout copper wire (1959: 698). The necklet (PI. V: 5) was intact when first uncovered but the wire was pulled out of position and the leather core broken when being removed from the bog. The hoard was acquired as Treasure Trove by the Royal Irish Academy and deposited amongst the collections of prehistoric gold in the National Museum, Reg. Nos. 1959: 693-698. The Museum is grateful to Matthew O'Connor, Birr Street, Kilcormac, for first bringing the discovery to scientific notice. The objects comprising the hoard were as follows: 693, Two gold bracelets. These form a pair, the only differences 694 between them being inessential details incidental to handworking. Each specimen is made from a rectangular sheet of thin gold folded 25See PPS 14 (1948), 234-5. **UJA 19 (1956), 29.

The object was strengthened by folding all the edges back on the body of the bracelet and hammering to produce a stout flange running all round the edges on the outside. The whole surface of the bracelet is ornamented. The decoration consists of a combination of repousse and punched devices, the hammering being done on the inner, the punching on the outer surface. The major portion of the ornament comprises five plain repousse bands running round the bracelet which alternate with six bands of short, vertical oval ridges. These bands are contained within a rectangular, raised frame, between the narrow ends of which and the edges of the bracelet there are three vertical lines of dots punched on the outer surface and separated from each other by plain ridges. The bracelets are now somewhat distorted but the openings appear to have been oval originally. At one end, the axes of the bracelets measure 6.2 cm. and 5.3 cm., at the other, 5.7 cm. and 5.1 cm., respectively. Where the terminals meet, the bracelets are 6.9 cm. wide and, at a point opposite this, they measure 7.3 cm. in width. 693 weighs 2 ozs. 3 dwts. 16 grs., 694 is 2 ozs. 3 dwts. 10 grs. (PI. V: 1, 2). 695, Two gold tress-rings. Like the preceding specimens they are 696 formed of rectangular sheets of gold, .4 mm. thick, bent to ring shape, the short edges just touching. The long edges are thickened by fold ing and hammering so that a strengthening flange is produced. The outer surface in each case is ornamented with a series of fine, horizontal grooves, set very closely together. External D., 3.7 cm.; W., 2.7 cm. Weights, 695, 8 dwts. 16 grs., 696, 8 dwts. 16J grs. (PI. V: 3, 4). 697 Necklet. It consists of gold wire wound on a cylindrical leather core. Much of the wire had been pulled off the core when it reached the Museum but some sections still remained intact. There is no reliable information about the original appearance of the necklet as a whole but it is probable that the restoration illustrated on PI. V is the correct one and would justify the use of the term 'necklet'. It consists of three elements?a sewn leather core, a length of coiled gold wire and a cylindrical gold clasp. When received in the Museum the two ends of the necklet were in position within the clasp. The leather core is made from a thin strip, probably continuous, folded over and sewn with gut from the inside with zig-zag stitches. The leather core is 4 mm. in diameter externally. It was covered all over by a closely coiled gold wire of D-section, the full length of unbroken wire used being 15.25 m. It is 1 mm. wide and half that in thickness. The wire-covered leather core appears to have formed a necklet, drop-shaped in outline; its two ends were brought together and fitted tightly into a gold clasp of cylindrical shape, the closed end of which had a projecting flange all round. Two holes opposite each</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 57 other near the open end of the clasp suggest the former existence of a peg or pin for securing the two ends of the necklet within the clasp. The clasp is 1.6 cm. long and 7 mm. in external diameter. Including the projecting flange, the closed end of the clasp is 9.5 mm. in diameter. The long axis of the necklet is 37.7 cm. overall, the shorter axis 23 cm. Its expanded length is 94 cm.; its weight (including the leather core) is 19 dwts. 17 grs. (PI. V: 5). 698 Thick copper wire of round section. The surface is pitted and somewhat uneven. A seam running along its whole length suggests the possibility that the wire was made by bending a strip over and hammering it on itself when heated. There was an ancient crack on this folding seam; this broke through when the wire was lifted from the bog. The wire is folded into a rough circle with overlapping ends. External axes, 13 cm. and 12 cm.; T. 5 mm. (PI. V: 6). If one excludes the copper wire (698) it seems a legitimate inference that the gold objects in the Derrinboy hoard represent a set of personal ornaments?a necklet, two wristlets and two smaller, wide rings which, it is here suggested, were worn as 'tress rings'. No ready explanation of the presence of the piece of copper in a context of personal accessories occurs to the writer. There seems little doubt that the material was deliberately hidden in the bog, rather than lost or deposited ritually; and this, coupled with the nature of the articles and the period to which they belong?Late Bronze Age?brings the Derrinboy gold hoard into conformity with the large number of other Irish Late Bronze Age deposits of personal ornaments of gold. The collar of wire and leather is so far without parallel. Technically, it is of a high standard of production, the manufacture alone of such an unbroken length of wire of D-section being something that would set a problem to a modern goldsmith. There are five complete and two incomplete 'tress rings' in the National Collection; one of these (R. 4034), of unknown provenance, appears to have been a single find; all the others were found in pairs. (W. 273, W. 279: found in a hoard at Saint johns, Co. Kildare; W. 292, W. 293: found together in Co. Tipperary; W. 294, W. 295, no provenance). The ornament of fine, parallel grooves occurs also on the double-conical hair ornaments of thin sheet gold which the Gorteenreagh, Co. Clare, hoard (Archaeological News Letter, Jan./Feb. 1953, p. 177) shows belong to the Late Bronze Age. In the Gorteenreagh group is found the fine-groove ornament as well as the repousse decoration of the large gorgets or collars. In the Derrinboy hoard the same combination is found, the large wristlets being decorated in the manner of the gorgets and the 'tress rings' like the hair ornaments. A close affinity between these two hoards is shown by the use in each of repousse and punched work on the same article. On the terminals of the Derrinboy wristlets one can observe two lines</page><page sequence="18">58 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND of dots punched from the front with, between them, a line of tiny repousse dots; on the Gorteenreagh collar the repousse ridges are divided by lines of dots punched from the front. Parallels in gold to wristlets of the Derrinboy type?also known as ribbed bracelets?are preserved in the National Museum from Dysart, Co. Westmeath (R. 4052) and Skreen, Ardnaglass, Co. Sligo (S.A. 1913: 126). They are, however, single finds. The Derrinboy hoard is of much interest for technological reasons; it is also significant in that, within itself, it embodies much information about Ireland's external contacts in the Late Bronze Age. The ribbed bracelets, linked in manner of execution and ornament to the large collars, point to Northern Germany and Scandinavia; the 'tress rings' are related by their decoration to the biconical hair-ornaments which, in turn, tie Ireland to France and farther afield to east Central Europe; the closest parallels to the wire of the Derrinboy necklet appear to be in the peculiar decoration of Villanovan bronze fibulae on the one hand and northern sword-hilts on the other. The several lines of enquiry suggest for the Derrinboy hoard a date in the seventh century B.C. JOSEPH RAFTERY A SETTLEMENT IN THE SANDHILLS AT DOOEY, CO. DONEGAL The site is situated in the townland of Dooey, parish of Letter macaward, barony of Boylagh, Co. Donegal. It lies on the edge of a fairly level plain which forms part of a peninsula bounded by the estuary of the Gweebarra River on the south and by Trawenagh Bay on the north. In the immediate neighbourhood of the site the coastal portion of the Dooey peninsula is strewn with sand dunes, some of which rise to a height of more than 20 metres. In this, it is similar to other coastal districts in the county, in particular, Narin-Portnoo, which lies on the opposite shore of the Gweebarra estuary, Rossbeg, Maghera, Dunfanaghy and Bundoran.29 Marked "Cloghastuckan" on the Ordnance map, the site was formerly a grass-covered dune with an upright standing stone at its approximate centre.30 From the year 1939 onwards, due to the burrowing of rabbits and as a result of erosion of the surface by wind, human skeletons were uncovered at the site from time to time. As erosion continued a number of finds of archaeological interest were reported 2?Finds from Irish sandhills are listed in PRIA 17, 1889, 173-178, 612-625; 19, 1895, 650-663. Co.

In recent years the grass sod which had once covered the dune was eroded away and the standing stone, formerly a prominent feature, was undermined and fell. The western sector of the site had suffered con siderably from the action of the wind and it was in this sector in particular that skeletons and objects had come to light; erosion had completely removed the original strata and a deep wind-scooped hollow in this part of the site had greatly changed its original contours. The finds which had come to light from time to time previous to excavation suggested that it was a habitation site and the discovery of the human skeletons seemed to indicate that the site had also been used as a cemetery. In order to establish the extent of the original settlement two cuttings, each 3 m. wide, were made through the approx imate centre of the site (from north to south and from east to west); the remaining areas were excavated by the use of the grid system. The stratification, though varied because of differential sand-blowing and erosion of various parts of the site, was fairly consistent, particularly in the lower levels. Briefly, the sequence of phases as revealed by the excavation was as follows: Phase 1 An unprotected area, approximately 56 m. N-S and 64 m. E-W, was inhabited apparently for a short period. The chief feature of this phase of habitation was a number of fire pits all of which contained a charcoal layer. Shallow and deep pits were found and the deep pits, which were flat-bottomed and rather straight-sided, were in general about 2 m. in diameter and 70 cm. in depth. Phase 2 The central portion of the area mentioned in Phase 1 was surrounded by a fosse which at its deepest part measured 75 cm. The top of the fosse, from edge to edge, was 2 m. in width. The area encircled by the fosse was 38 m. N-S and 40 m. E-W. It is unfortunate that this central area, protected by a fosse and therefore presumably an important 31The National Museum wishes to express its thanks to the following persons for donations of material discovered at the site before excavation commenced : ?

Sullivan, Dublin.</page><page sequence="20">60 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND part of the site, should have been chosen in later times as a cemetery site (see Phase 4). As a result of the disturbance by the burials few of the finds from the area inside the fosse were found in situ. Phase 3 The fosse filled up rather quickly with blown sand and with habitation refuse, mainly animal bones and shells of molluscs. When the fosse had become almost completely filled an enlargement of the site appears to have taken place and this is represented by an occupation layer running from the central area over the partially-filled fosse and beyond it, this habitation layer being delimited on the eastern side of the site by a trench averaging 75 cm. wide and 40 cm. deep. Phase 4 The central area of the site was used as a cemetery from which upwards of 70 skeletons were excavated. Taking into account the number of skeletons uncovered by wind erosion in previous years, particularly in the western part of the site, the original number of burials may be estimated conservatively at a hundred or more. Almost all of the skeletons were extended and orientated E-W, heads to the west. Some of the burials were made in individual graves. Other graves contained two skeletons, one above the other, but since in no case had the bones of the lower skeleton been disturbed, it would appear that either the two bodies had been placed in the grave simultaneously or the second inter ment had followed the first after a fairly short interval. The remains included those of men, women and children. Portion of the upper stone of a rotary quern was found with one of the 'burials. No other associated material was found in the course of the excavation of the burials. The standing stone from which the site takes its name?Clogh astuckan?was 2.65 m. long, 33 cm. wide and 25 cm. thick. It bore no markings and was erected, probably in the final stages of this phase of the site, to mark the central burial area. No dating evidence is available for the period of the use of the site as a cemetery but the fact that the interments were intrusive in the occupation strata establishes that it was later than the habitation phase. Remarks Postholes were found associated with the first three phases of the site but stonework was noticeably absent from Phase 1. A hearth with a stone setting was associated with Phase 2 and to Phase 3 belonged a short pathway which traversed the filled-up fosse. A number of stones, possibly representing a collapsed structure, were found within the fosse surrounded area and they also belonged to Phase 3. Many other stones, found scattered haphazardly on the surface of the site before excavation</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 61 commenced, probably originally belonged to Phase 3 but, due to the disturbance in Phase 4 and due to disturbance in more recent times, it is not possible to determine their structural significance. Finds About 2,000 items were found during the excavation, most of them, unfortunately, not closely stratified. In general, however, it would appear from the finds, as well as from the nature of the site itself, that occupation there probably did not last for more than a century or two at the most and that, furthermore, it was of fairly continuous duration. Even a cursory examination of the finds and the results of the excavation in general show that the inhabitants at Dooey were almost entirely self-sufficient. The evidence seems to suggest that the site was inhabited by a community of craftsmen who also practised agriculture and kept domestic animals. The secondary importance of the agrarian aspect of their lives is suggested by the relative scarcity of sickles, shears and other such articles. The animal bones found show that cattle, sheep and pigs were kept, while the presence on the site of much antler, worked and unworked, and of fish-bones demonstrates that the food supply was augmented by hunting and fishing, parallel evidence for which is supplied by finds of flint arrowheads and iron fish-hooks. Large middens of the shells of oysters, mussels, clams, periwinkles and limpets prove that shell-fish were an important item in the community's diet. But by far the greatest quantity of shells found were of the small, white, dog-whelk (Nucella (Purpura) lapillus L.). In all cases the ultimate whorl of this spiralled shell had been broken off and this, taken in conjunction with the fact that they were found in separate middens unmixed with the shells of the edible shell-fish, suggests that they were collected selectively for the purpose of producing a purple or crimson dye. Apart from the food-producing aspect of life in the settlement, there is much evidence to suggest that the main work of the inhabitants was the manufacture of objects of iron, bronze, bone and antler, and that the site was an important centre of industry. Large quantities of iron slag testified to iron working and on various parts of the site complete and fragmentary clay moulds (Fig. 7) and crucibles, for the manufacture of bronze articles, were found, while bone and antler working of a high order was a feature of at least one phase, the second, of the occupation. The majority of the objects found were of iron and included items representative of nearly every aspect of the lives of the inhabitants. By far the most numerous group comprised iron knives, over 120 of which, complete or fragmentary, were discovered. Some of these still had bone or antler handles attached, while fragments of wood still adhered to the corroded tangs of others. Many of these knives were probably used for industrial rather than domestic purposes and may, therefore, be included among the many iron tools found at the site.</page><page sequence="22">62 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND These last included numerous tanged points or awls (a small bronze awl was also found), a couple of chisels and gouges, a hammer-head, an implement, possibly a pincers, and several pronged tools with split sockets which may, perhaps, have been used for leather- or wood-working. Iron was used in many cases for the manufacture of pins, ring brooches, belt-buckles, and similar objects. The iron ring-brooches are nearly all of the penannular type with outwardly bent-back terminals, a type probably derived from the Roman and post-Roman "omega" type. Bronze was, however, the material most used for decorative pur poses and about 50 complete or fragmentary bronze pins, many of them tastefully ornamented, were found. Bronze ring-brooches were rare, but the ring-pins found are almost as numerous as the pins. Four of these are of the "omega" type, having their terminals shaped to give the impression of birds' heads. There are also several bronze belt-buckles, I ?' " mm lcm Fig. 7.

This nearly complete specimen (portion of another was also found) is of a type rather rare in Ireland but which is very common during Migration times on the Continent. Three, at least, of the bronze objects found have amber settings and two small bronze mountings originally had enamel decoration. One of these still retains three of its four pieces of millefiori set into a field of champleve enamel. Although several glass beads were also found, there is no evidence to suggest that glass was ever manufactured at the site and it appears probable that glass and amber were imported,</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 63 Fig. 8. Carved antler object, Dooey, Co. Donegal.</page><page sequence="24">64 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND possibly in exchange for some of the fine bronze articles made there. Very few bronzes came from the earliest phase of occupation and those which did appear to be importations rather than articles made on the site. They include two silvered or tinned finger-rings and two toilet articles of the type known as nail-cleaners, all of which may, perhaps, have come from post-Roman Scotland. There are other signs of influence from post-Roman Scotland among the finds from Dooey, notably part of an iron pin which has a hollow bone head which is almost identical with some ten or twelve Scottish specimens. Somewhat similar pin-heads were found at the crannogs of Ballinderry 2 and Lagore, although these have bone or wooden stems. Many of the very numerous polished bone pins or fragments of pins found also show a relationship with post-Roman Scottish pins, but there was also present in significant numbers a distinctively Irish type of pin which is characterised by a backward curve of the lower half of the stem near its point. Some of these have finely carved anthropomorphic or zoomorphic heads. Hencken (PRIA, 53, 1950, 190) refers to such pins as toilet-articles. Delicate carving was a feature of many of the pins, needles, combs, spindle-whorls, knife-handles and other objects of bone or antler found on the site, the finest example being an object of unknown use found in the lowest or primary phase of habitation. This object (Fig. 8) is made of a portion of antler, 12 cm. long by 4.4 cm. in maximum diameter. It is covered with panels of carving executed in chip-carving {kerbschnitt) technique. Four of these are filled with beautiful scroll work, four with tightly-packed rows of chevrons, while two small circular panels are each filled with a marigold. A short length of herring bone ornament is incised at one end of the object, while lightly incised elsewhere is what appears to be an unfinished attempt at designing another marigold. Although the exact purpose for which this object was originally intended has still to be determined, its finding in a sealed and stratified occupation layer and its intrinsic artistic merit show it to be a find of primary importance and the dating applied to it must, in the final analysis, play an important role in the dating of the site. It is evident that the whole period of occupation belongs to the early centuries A.D., but a more exact statement of date must await the detailed analysis of the material. A. B. 6 RIORDAIN ETIENNE RYNNE A STONE BOWL OF VIKING TYPE FROM BEGINISH ISLAND, CO. KERRY This object was found during the summer of 1959 by Mr. F. Mackey of the Cable Station, Valentia Island, to whom the Museum is grateful for reporting the discovery and for the donation of the vessel. I arn personally indebted to him for his help and hospitality on the occasion</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 65 of my visit to the island in his company. Beginish lies near the tip of the Iveragh Peninsula and in the strait between Valentia Island and Doulus Head. When walking over a stony area of sand near the southern shore of the eastern part of the island, Mr. Mackey noticed part of the rim of the bowl protruding through the sand. On clearing the sand, approx imately half of the bowl came to light. It was not until a subsequent visit several days later that he was able to find the rest of the bowl (as a number of fragments) and then only by making a very careful search amongst the stones and by sieving the sand. The bowl has since been reconstructed by the Museum staff and, as can be seen from Plate VI: 1, very little of it is missing. I was invited by the Director of the Museum to contribute this note on the find because of my previous fieldwork on some of the monuments of the island.32 The bowl has an external diameter at its flat rim varying between 34.5 and 34.8 cm. The thickness at the rim varies from 1.5 to 2.0 cm., while the external vertical height varies between 17.0 and 17.5 cm. These variations, though small, are sufficient to show that the bowl was not lathe-turned, a fact which is made clear in any case by the tool marks that are visible on both inner and outer surfaces. There is no doubt that the bowl was hand-carved out of a single block of stone. The inner surface shows numerous short cuts (PL VI: 2) which lie at various angles and may have 'been made by some kind of chisel or gouge with slightly curved cutting edge, or with a knife which had a rounded end to its blade. These marks are a residue of the hollowing-out process. The external face exhibits numerous slight facets which indicate that a knife was used in various directions to shave off the unwanted material so as to give the bowl its final form and finish. The smooth external surface seems to have been achieved by this shaving process. If it had been rubbed down subsequently, the fine facets would not have survived for the material of the bowl is soft. On the inside the bowl is a light grey colour, but the outside is darkened from use over a fire. The darkening is little more than a light stain on the upper part, but lower down and on the bottom there is an appreciable accretion of carbonised soot. There are three roughly circular, shallow flake-scars (2, 4 and 5 cm. in diameter) on the external surface. These are ancient since they are partly sooted over. Cracks in the sides of the bowl were repaired in antiquity by means of stitches of iron wire run through holes bored through the stone on each side of the cracks. The bowl was provided with an iron handle attached by means of iron escutcheons which themselves wer** fixed to the bowl by iron rivets 32See O'Kelly: "An Island Settlement at Beginish, Co. Kerry" in PRIA 57 C, 1956, 159-194. The structures dealt with in this publication include eight houses and their associated fields and animal shelters as well as a Runic inscription discovered in the course of excavation. E</page><page sequence="26">66 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND (Fig. 9: 1, 2, 3). The handle originally could move freely in the eyes of the escutcheons in the same way as that of a modern bucket. One escutcheon and about half of the handle survive, but both are very heavily oxidised, so much so that cleaning could not be attempted without running the risk of destroying these features altogether. The radius of curvature of the handle was the same as that of the mouth of the bowl, so that when not in use it swung downwards to lie on the surface of the flat rim. The surviving escutcheon is 12 cm. long, almost 3 cm. wide and at least 1 cm. thick at the maximum points, but (because of the amount of corrosion and the accretion of rust and sand, these dimensions serve merely to give a general indication of the original size of the feature. It was held to the bowl by two iron rivets, set 6.5 cm. apart, which show on the inside of the vessel as rather flat exposures. The external '*&amp;'"' *'"" '" o_S 10cm, Fig. 9.

The missing escutcheon has left an oxide stain on the outer surface of the bowl, but this is not sufficiently well defined to give a reliable indication of the form of the fixture. It may, however, have been shorter and broader than the surviving escutcheon. One of the ancient cracks on the side of the vessel occurred just where this escutcheon had been attached and was repaired by inserting an iron stitch, parts of which remain in two of the holes through the vessel (PI. VI: 3; Fig. 9: 5, 6). Three other holes exist here which, though now quite open, exhibit oxide stains. The positions of the holes as well as differences in the staining suggest that more than one repair was carried out here and indeed it seems that the escutcheon itself was</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR 1959 67 moved from one side of the crack to the other. These careful if ineffective repairs suggest that the bowl was one of the treasured possessions of its owner. So far as I am aware, the Beginish find is the only example of this type of vessel known in Ireland. Its special interest lies in the fact that its close parallels are to be found in Viking contexts in Scandinavia and northern Germany. These north European bowls are made from soapstone and originate in southern Norway, where some of the quarries in which they have been made have been identified.33 The Scandinavian vessels are not lathe-turned. In fact, they were made by carving the living rock in the quarry sites. When the external form had been roughly achieved, the bowl-shaped piece was detached from the parent body of rock by undercutting the base. After the inside had been hollowed out on the spot, the bowl was taken from the quarry to the settlement site for finishing. According to Jankuhn, there was a specific trade in the manufactured 'bowls from Norway into Denmark and northern Germany, areas where they are well known and where they were used as cooking vessels. The Kerry bowl fits well into this picture in that its method of manufacture, its iron handle and the use to which it was put place it in the same category as that of the north European examples. Can our find, then, be regarded as an import into Ireland from Scandinavia? an object which had its ultimate origin in Norway? Here a difficulty arises. The Norwegian bowls are made from soapstone whereas the Beginish find is made from chlorite schist, a different though related material. Chlorite schist is harder than soapstone but, nevertheless, is soft enough to be cut easily with a knife (soapstone has a hardness of 1, chlorite schist a hardness of 1J to 2\). Dr. Jackson, Keeper of the Natural History Division of the Museum, reports on the material of the bowl as follows: ? "This is essentially a monomineralic mass of the mineral chlorite (the hydrated silica of aluminium, iron and magnesium) with subordinate quantities of limonite (the hydrated oxide of iron). The chlorite occurs in tabular and foliaceous scales having preferred orientation so that the rock may be regarded as a chlorite schist. The disseminated 'pockets* of limonite probably represent the alteration products of pyrite and many of the 'pockets' have retained an obvious cubic form. They do not appear to be residual limonite resulting from the decomposition of the iron garnet almandine." Dr. Jackson cannot at present suggest a probable provenance in in Ireland for this type of rock. It is a metamorphic material and since the backbone of Beginish Island is an igneous intrusion mainly composed 33See H. Jankuhn: Haithabu, ein Handelsplatz der Wikingerzeit, (3 Auflager Neumtinster, 1956), pp. 167 ff. and distribution map, Fig. 32. I am indebted to Dr. O. Klindt-Jensen, National Museum, Copenhagen, for this reference. E2</page><page sequence="28">68 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND of greenstone diorite, the possibility that there was an immediately local source of the chlorite schist cannot be absolutely ruled out though no such occurrence is at present known. Whether the bowl was made in Ireland or in Scandinavia or elsewhere cannot, therefore, be determined until further geological work has been done. The find-spot of the bowl on Beginish is itself of some interest. It came from the sand about 3 m. to the north-east of the north-east corner of House 6. This and the conjoined House 7 are the only rectangular structures in the settlement of eight houses and, while this plan-form may be due to Viking influence, the houses are themselves not typical of the known Viking dwellings. Viking activity in the area is attested in annalistic references34 and the Runic inscription35 found on Beginish itself shows that there was some settlement of these people in the district. The bowl is, therefore, a welcome addition to the surpris ingly small body of Viking material that has been found in Ireland. MICHAEL J.

Fermanagh. A large, narrow-butted specimen. The butt, which is rounded and sharp, is slightly damaged. The narrow sides splay out to a wide and deeply convex cutting-edge. The axehead thickens in the middle so that a form of stop-ridge is produced. The narrow edges have been hammered to form an ornamental pattern of pointed ovals and, as a result of the hammering, very slight side-flanges have been produced. On each of the broad faces, between the central thickening and a slight ridge above the cutting-edge, there is a panel of decoration divided into two by a central, incised line. In each of the two narrow rectangles thus formed there is a series of triangles filled with punched dots; on the cutting-edge side of the rectangle there is a narrow band with an incised chevron motif.

Narrow-butted specimen with thickening in the centre and sharp, round butt, splaying narrow sides and deeply convex cutting-edge. The hammering of an ornamental cable pattern on each of the narrow edges has produced a very slight, flange-like edge to the broad faces. From the central thickening there extends towards the cutting edge a zone, almost 5 cm. wide, covered with small, slanting strokes to form a 'rain pattern.' Between this zone and the cutting-edge and parallel with the latter are two wide grooves formed by hammering. L. 16.8 cm.; W. at cutting-edge, 9.1 cm., at butt, 3 cm.; T. (max.) 1.3 cm.

The narrow edges are parallel for most of their length and then splay out to a wide cutting-edge. The transverse section is rectangular, the longitudinal section a pointed oval. Each of the broad f&amp;ces bears the same decorative pattern. From the butt to the centre approximately there is a lightly-incised zig-zag pattern and from this point almost to the cutting-edge there are, running parallel with each of the narrow sides, two narrow bands made up of short strokes. One face is deeply pitted; this is probably a casting flaw. L. 15.25 cm.; W. at cutting-edge, 8 cm., at butt, 2.4 cm.; T. (max.) 1.15 cm. (Fig. 15 : 3). 62 Found in Co. Wexford. A large axehead of narrow-butted type. The rounded narrow edges have been hammered to a series of contiguous, long pointed ovals; in consequence of the hammering very slight side-flanges have been produced. The specimen thickens slightly towards the centre and between the ridge thus formed and the cutting-edge there is a series of eight slight ridges formed by hammering. They are equally spaced and the shallow zones between them carry short, parallel, vertical strokes. Both faces are similarly decorated. L. 22.4 cm.; W. at cutting-edge, 11.7 cm., at butt, 3.8 cm.; T.

BRONZE SPEARHEADS With Loops on Socket 19 Found at an uncertain depth in a bog in Lahardan td., Co. Clare. The socket continues as a rounded midrib to the tip of the blade which is wide. From the lower edges of the blade two ridges run towards the tip, joining the socket at a sharp angle. The metal of the loops has been expanded by hammering to give them a broad oval shape on their outer aspects. L. 17.25 cm.; max. W. of blade, 5.6 cm.; external D. of socket, 2 cm.41 The loops are 2.2 cm. long and 1.3 cm. wide. 11 Found 3 feet deep in Derrybrien bog, Maghera td., Co. Clare. The socket continues as a rounded midrib for about half the length of the blade which is narrow and has bevelled edges. The loops are lozenge-shaped. There is a hole on one side of the socket near its end in the blade, but this appears to be ancient. L. 11.9 cm.; max. W. of blade, 2.55 cm.; external D. of socket, 2 cm. The loops are 2.2 cm. long and 9 mm. wide. 157 Found at Finglas, Co. Dublin. There are two cracks in the blade, which appear to be ancient, possibly casting flaws. The socket continues upwards through half the length of the blade; the midrib?a narrow ridge?runs from the tip to a line between the tops of the two loops; externally, it gives a lozenge-shaped section. The edges of the blade are bevelled. The loops have very small openings and the metal has been expanded by hammering to pro duce an oval shape on their outer aspects. There is a shallow, rounded groove round the socket just above the rim. L. 10.55 cm.; max. W. of blade, 2.7 cm.; external D. of socket, 1.85 cm. The loops are 1.65 cm. long and 4 mm. wide. 158 Found in Derrynahesco td., Co. Monaghan. The tip is now rounded, the edges of the blade are bevelled. The socket continues almost to the point of the weapon. On the outer surface it gives a lozenge-shaped section. From the lower edges of the blade, on each side of the midrib, a narrow ridge runs almost to the tip, joining the midrib at an acute angle. Each ridge is flanked by two shallow depressions running parallel to it, the edge of that nearer the midrib producing the appearance of a second rib. Running round the base of the socket there is a single incised line; the lip of the socket has been hammered and bent back and the outline of the socket deformed, but whether through faulty casting in ancient times or not is not evident. The metal of the loops has been expanded by hammering to give them a lozenge shape on their outer aspects and hammer marks may be observed on the socket alongside them. One of the loops appears to be a replacement, that is, a new loop cast on to take the place of a defective one. Both loops are ornamented: in each case an incised line runs beside the edge and, inside this on the replacement loop just mentioned, there are two incised lines crossing at an acute angle; on the other loop there are two similarly placed lines crossed by a third which is off centre. L. 11.85 cm.; max. W. of blade, 4 cm.; external D. of socket, 1.85 cm.; the loops are 2.2 cm. and 1.9 cm. long and 8.5 mm. and 9.5 mm. wide respectively. 156 Found in Rathcarrick td., Co. Sligo. Small specimen, badly damaged. Much of the blade is missing. The socket continues almost to the tip of the blade and gives a rounded section externally.

F</page><page sequence="42">82 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND 180 Found at Tobercurry, Co. Sligo. The socket continues almost to the tip of the blade, the edges of which are bevelled, and the external section of the socket changes from rounded below the base of the blade to lozenge-shaped in the blade itself. The mouth of the socket is bent slightly all round. One loop is missing, apparently since ancient times; the metal of the other has been expanded by hammering to produce a pointed oval shape on the outer aspect. Both are continuations of the blade but are not incorporated in it. One edge of the blade is concave, probably due to sharpening. L. 23.2 cm.; max. W. of blade, 3.8 cm.; external D. of socket, 2.2 cm.; the remaining loop is 2.2 cm. long and 9 mm. wide. 162 Found at Benburb, Co. Tyrone. The socket appears to extend almost to the tip of the weapon. It is rounded at the mouth but changes, at about the level of the base of the blade, to a lozenge-shaped section. The edges are blunt and the point is not sharp. A raised mid-rib runs along the outside of the socket from tip to the loops, the metal of which has been expanded by hammering to produce a pointed oval shape on their outer aspects. L. 20.8 cm.; max. W. of blade, 3.6 cm.; external D. of socket, 1.95 cm.; loops, 2.4 cm. long, 9.5 mm. wide. 165 Also from Benburb, Co. Tyrone. Small specimen. Junction of base and edge of blade rounded. Socket has external rim-bevel; it is rounded from opening to loops and then changes to a lozenge-shaped cross-section. Edges and point of blade blunt. Loops thin and expanded by hammering to an oval shape on their outer aspects, the hammer marks being visible. L. 10 cm.; max. W. of blade, 2.55 cm.; external D. of socket, 1.5 cm.; loops are 1.7 cm. long, 6 mm. wide. 604 Found at Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow. Socket continues just to the tip of the blade. Externally, it is rounded throughout its length on one side; on the other there is a roughly cast midrib. On the blade, on each side of the socket, there is a deep, V-shaped groove from the outer edge of which the blade is bevelled. The base of the blade continues along the socket to join the loops, the metal of which has been expanded by hammering to produce a pointed oval shape on their outer aspects. L. 11.4 cm.; max. W. of blade, 2.8 cm.; external D. of socket, 2.1 cm.; the loops measure 2.3 cm. long and 8 mm. wide. Spearheads with Peg-holes in Socket. 163 Found at Cavan, Co. Cavan. Portion of mouth of socket missing as well as a large part of the blade. The blade resembles in shape those of the previous group, consisting of two long edges and two shorter basal sides. The socket runs only a short distance into the blade which has a strong midrib of lozenge-shaped section. There is a slight, rounded collar on the mouth of the socket. The two pegholes are close to the rim of the socket. They are counter sunk and the edges of the holes have not been cleaned. Though ancient, to judge from their patination, it may be that these holes are secondary and may not have been used. Running around the socket at the level of these holes there is a lightly-incised discontinuous line, but this looks modern, as if it were the beginning of an attempt to shorten the socket. L. 11.75 cm.; max. W. of blade, reconstructed, 5 cm.; external D. of socket, 1.95 cm. 168 Found at Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal. The point is missing and the edges of the blade are broken off along their length. The socket continues almost to the tip of the blade. From the rim upwards it is cylindrical for 4 cm. and then, at the peg-holes, it narrows and continues as a gradually tapering midrib in the blade. This is not a common feature. L. 14.4 cm.

L. 28.5 cm.; W. at shoulders, 2.3 cm.; max. T. of blade, 4 mm. BRONZE SWORDS 172 Found in Mullyleggan td., Co. Armagh. Sword broken across the blade into two pieces; the hilt-plates are preserved. They are made from antler, probably of red deer. The blade has a pointed oval cross section and a not very pronounced ricasso. There are four counter-sunk rivet-holes in the tang; these are not expertly made. In addition, there are, on one side, four rough depressions, two on each edge of the plate; these look like incipient rivet holes; on the other side two such depressions are visible. Two of the rivet holes are in the tang proper and two are in the shoulders of the blade. One rivet remains. It is poorly made and appears to have been hammered to shape. Its patination differs considerably from that of the rest of the sword; it is possibly a modern addition. The hafting-plate was broken in ancient times and a new end cast on to the remaining stump. The hilt-plates are now much thinner than they were originally, the hard outer surface of the antler having disappeared completely to leave only the F2</page><page sequence="44">84 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND soft spongy core. The two pieces of antler, forming the plates, are wider than the tang and the shoulders of the blade. L. of sword, 50.6 cm.; W. across shoulder, 4.3 cm.; T. of hilt (including antler plates), 3.3 cm. (Figs. 17, 18). 174 Found at Willowfield Lough, Cannaboe td., near Ballinamore, Co. Leitrim. Short sword with pointed oval cross-section, slightly bevelled edges and deep ricasso. There is a rivet-hole in each shoulder and one in the wide portion of the tang. The holes appear to have been punched after the weapon had been cast: that in the tang was made, counter-sunk fashion, from one side. One of the shoulder holes has been enlarged so that it is now pear-shaped rather than round. At the T-shaped end there is a shallow, rounded depression giving the appearance of a fishtail ending. &gt;' O ?j *% * ?T v ' / \r I&amp; i /' W \ I'*-*!.; \ if': 'i ( ' A 1 ' \kJA ^i_, usH | 5cm: \ ^ / | EJJU RF3 ]j?--\ f ' ?^ w'" "S II fa "v) | I "** ~^fm 1 V / ? \ / ? :y, ? ^m&gt; Rivet ? ? iBHMHitil \ / \ / t J 1 5~~I 2~~3 &lt;T^cm _ I ?/ ^tf^te Q_3cm.

The tang is incomplete; one side of the T-shaped end is missing, but the edges of the remaining portion are smooth and rounded, suggesting the possibility that the sword never was complete in the conventional manner at the tang-end. On one face of the tang there is an irregular groove running the length of the haft between the rivet holes, of which there are three, equally spaced. On the other face there is a similar groove, not so pronounced and in addition a groove which runs along each edge and continues to the rivet-hole near the point of each shoulder.

Sword with wide blade swelling from narrow shoulders, no ricasso and a lozenge-shaped cross-section. The edges of the tang swell slightly; there is no T-shaped ending as is usual on these swords. There are three rivet-holes evenly spaced along the tang and a central groove runs through them along the length of the tang; there is a similar groove running along each edge of the hilt and across each shoulder to its point. In each shoulder there is one rivet-hole, one being somewhat defective. On each face of the blade, on one side of the midrib, a number of long striations resemble the grain of wood. It has been suggested that these are derived from a clay mould which was made from a master mould in wood. L. 39.8 cm.; W. across shoulders, 3.45 cm.; max. T. of blade, 7 mm.

The cross section of the socket is now rectangular with rounded ends, but it may originally have been oval. In it, on one side, there are two irregular holes, on the other side, one hole which does not lie opposite either of the other two. From its opening the sides of the socket slope inwards towards the closed end. The blade and socket were cast as a unit; the blade is not set centrally to the socket. It is long and narrow and a pointed oval in cross-section. It is now somewhat twisted, but it is not clear that this was an original feature.

External rim D. 29.5 cm.; base D., 12.5 cm.; H., 27.8 cm.; T. of wall, 1.7 cm. Prof. C. A. Erskine, School of Anatomy, Trinity College, Dublin reports as follows on the bones (1959 : 21) : ? "The bones consist chiefly of small, completely calcined fragments of human origin; they comprise parts of the skeleton of 1 adult and 1 child.</page><page sequence="48">88 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND The larger pieces are adult long bones of 5 cm.-7 cm. and pieces of flat skull bone; in addition, there is a large number of rib fragments present. The child's bones are mainly segments of skull and vertebrae. No teeth could be found among the material and there are only small fragments of mandible present. No opinion can be given as to sex, or cause of death." The State Chemist, D. H. Earle, M.Sc, and Dr. J. S. Jackson, Keeper of the Natural History Division, National Museum, examined the pieces of metallic foil (1959:21 A). They report that this proved to be lead, the oxidised surface of which was contaminated with a certain amount of aluminous clay material. It was clear that the lead foil had been deposited with the bones after their cremation, for the relatively high temperature necessary for the incineration of the bones would have caused the metal to be reduced to small beads or to a single lump. Burials of the Shevry type?cremation in a cinerary urn of the 'encrusted' group?are of common occurrence in this country and in Britain. The only unusual feature is the presence of the lead foil which, as far as I am aware, is without parallel. Present evidence indicates that 'encrusted' urns are Bronze Age in date and that they should not all be dated, as was once thought probable, to the later stages of that period. A date ? 1000 B.C. seems to be likely for the Shevry burial. 9 Round-bottomed, ornamented vessel of Neolithic type. Found about 10 feet below the surface of a bog in Bracklin td., Co. Westmeath (Fig. 1). The discovery is described in detail about, p. 43. 577 Food vessel found with skeleton. Provenance unknown but probably from the Malahide neighbourhood of Co. Dublin. The specimen has been broken into small sherds; about two-thirds of the upper portion of the vessel only is capable of reconstruction. The pot was apparently of that variety of the Bowl Group with two ridges round the body, only the upper ridge being extant. The rim is internally bevelled and ornamented with a rounded zig-zag band in false relief. The lip of the vessel on the external surface is decorated with sloping parallel lines of comb impressions below which is a narrow false relief zig-zag band; then comes a broad band of sloping lines of comb impressions and a hori zontal, false relief, zig-zag band; next comes the horizontal ridge with reserved comb-decorated lozenges within a false relief framework of zig-zags, the external triangular spaces of which are also filled with lines of comb ornament. The biscuit is fine and hard; no visible bonding grits are visible. Only a few of the bones of the skeleton have been preserved. Rim D., 14 cm.; T. of wall, 8 m.m. BURIALS, PREHISTORIC AND LATER 29, Cremated human bones from a short cist, Kilmurry td., Co. Kilkenny.43 30 Only one individual was represented, but neither age nor sex could be established by Prof. E. Keenan, University College, Dublin, who examined the remains. With them was found a small piece of quartz called a ' slickensides.' This, though not a humanly worked object, may have had a ritual or cere monial significance. The grave was roughly rectangular: its sides were formed of six conglomerate slabs, two of them, at the eastern end, sloping slightly towards each other. Internally, the cist was 76 cm. long E-W, 38 cm. wide and about 41 cm. deep. The floor of the cist was covered by a single slab which fitted closely. It was closed by a capstone, 20 cm. below the surface, measuring 90 cm. long, 60 cm. wide and 18 cm. thick. The cremated bones lay in the centre of the bottom slab and a layer, about 3 cm. thick, of earth had filtered in to cover the whole slab. 24, Human skeletal remains. Derrymaquirk td., Co. Roscommon. The remains of 25 two individuals were discovered during turf-cutting operations 1.65 cm. below the surface of the bog, which lies close to the eastern shore of Lough Gara. The bodies were those of a well-formed woman, about 25 years old, some five high and with a cephalic index of 74.25 (mesaticephalic) and of a child about 43A brief report of the discovery has been published by Miss E.

The body of the young woman lay extended E-W on its back, the head to the west. It lay in a grave, oval in plan, 1.80 cin. long E-W and 70 cm. wide. Its depth was uncertain. This was dug into the peat and was lined with branches. Behind the skull there was a large, irregular block of wood and a smaller knot of wood lay under the ends of the femora at the eastern end of the grave. Over the body, in the region of the pelvis, was a flat stone, 30 cm. by 25 cm. by 10 cm. thick. Just beside it lay the skull portion of the child. No statement can be made as to the disposition or orientation of the child's bones. At the eastern end of the grave, near the young woman's feet, were a few animal bones, of dog and sheep or goat. The only artefact recovered was a small knife-handle made from the tine of a red deer antler. A double row of grooves ran round the wider end of the object. 737 Human skeleton. Found in a quarry in Slagfield, Mackeralackagh td., Co. to Sligo. The grave was disturbed before it could be investigated, but the body 743 appeared to have been deposited with the head to the west. How it had been interred originally was not clear as the bones were found in a disarticulated condition. It is uncertain whether the grave was a natural cleft in the rock or was artificially cut. It measured 2 m. long, but was probably somewhat longer before quarrying commenced at the site. It was 1 m. wide. The bottom of the grave was 1 m. below the surface. The humus layer on top was 20 cm. thick so that the fill of the grave, consisting of broken pieces of rock and earth, was 80 cm. deep. A few objects were found scattered through this fill. They are : ? 737 Potsherd, portion of rim. Hard, brick-red biscuit. No visible bonding grits. L. 3.2 cm.; W. 1.6 cm.; T. 7 mm. 738 Potsherd. Hard biscuit, no bonding grits.

It is difficult to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion about the nature or date of this burial. The broken rock in the fill of the grave suggests that a natural cleft had been slightly enlarged. It is possible that the objects discovered in the fill had been on the site before it was adapted for burial and may, therefore, not be used for dating purposes. They may themselves be ascribed to the later mediaeval centuries, but the burial can be appreciably later than this. 16 Cremated human bones. From a pit in Reardnogy More td., Co. Tipperary. The site was a flat, sandy area about 700 ft. O.D. and had been marked by a prostrate pointed stone which may originally have stood upright. It was 1.70 m. long, 80 cm. in maximum width and averaged 25 cm. thick. This rested over a bucket-shaped pit, 65 cm. deeo and 52 cm. wide at the surface. The humus here was 23 cm. deep; it overlay a layer, 7 cm. thick, of yellow soil and under this was a horizontal flagstone, roughly squared, measuring 55 cm. along each side and averaging 5 cm. thick. Below this the pit was filled with burnt earth, ashes, charcoal and cremated bones. There was no stratigraphy in the fill. Because of the fragmented and warped condition of the bones no estimate as to the number of individuals, their sex, age or other physical characters could be made by Prof. E. Keenan, University College, Dublin, who kindly carried out the examination.

Found in Co. Wexford. The pin, of round cross-section, widens gradually from the tip to a point where it bends bends at right angles; on the end of the projecting arm thus formed there is an open ring in the same plane as the pin. The ring is flat on the back, con vex on the front surface. It widens out on its lower side and here there is a central, circular, flat knob flanked by two stylised, snout-like projections. L. of pin, 9.1 cm.; max. D. 3.5 mm.; D. of ring, 1.25 cm. (Fig. 23b). 216 Bronze ring-pin of Omega type. Found in Co. Wexford. The pin is com paratively short, the ring very thin. The shaft of the pin is round in cross section. The head of the pin is flattened and bent over to form a loop. On its outer surface it is ornamented with a central ridge which runs round the loop, widening towards each end of the ring. The ring itself is round in cross-section. One of the everted ornithomorphic heads is broken off. L. of pin, 5.2 cm.; max. D. of shaft, 2 mm.; external D. of ring, 1 cm. (Fig. 23c). 217 Ring of ring-pin or brooch. Bronze. Irish but provenance not recorded. The ring is penannular, D-shaped in cross-section, flat on the back. Most of the circle is ornamented by a pronounced ribbing, running from terminal to terminal. The ends are a stylised variety of the zoomorphic brooch terminals. External D. 2.65 cm.; T. 3 mm. 626 Portion of bronze mount. Irish; provenance not recorded but it may be from Lagore Crannog. One end is broken, the other ends in a disc which is ornamented with a red enamelled pattern of a marigold; in each triangular space between the petals there is a miniature petal in red enamel flanked by two red enamel dots. Between this disc and a lip-like ridge is a hatched area which was probably enamelled originally. L. 3.7 cm.; max. W. 2.4 cm.; T. 2 mm. (Fig. 23d). 629 Bronze ring-brooch, zoomorphic type. Irish but provenance not recorded. Penannular with stylised zoomorphic terminals.

The sunken triangular ter minal panels have lost their enamel and are not ornamented on back or sides. The snouts, however, are cross-scored to take enamel. The loop of the pin is decorated with an incised line running close to each edge. The rest of the original pin is missing. Its place has been taken by an Early Christian pin which appears to have been soldered on to the loop in modern times. This pin has a rhomboid, faceted head, ornamented on one side with an incised swastika and, on the other, with a poorly executed piece of simple, single-strand interlacing. Running transversely at this point is the small hole through which the original ring swivelled. The pin, too, has been interfered with: the point has been worked to a short point, oblong in section. L. of pin, 8.5 cm.; D. of shaft, 4 mm.; external D. of ring, 5 cm. (Fig. 29). 630 Ring of bronze ring-brooch, zoomorphic type. Irish but provenance not recorded. Penannular. Ring plain, round in cross-section. Triangular terminals retain some of the discoloured red enamel. The pattern was a hand mirror like device encompassing two C-curves placed back to back. The edges of the triangular terminals are plain; the snouts, however, have a chevron pattern in red enamel. Back plain. External D. 5.7 cm. (Fig. 30). icm. I] -^2^W_ / V ^^^t^ icm. Fig. 29.

It consists of two parallel strips of bronze of D-section joined in a sharp arch by a piece of square section ornamented on one face by simple interlacing, which still retains traces of gilding. Each of the arms is broken where there was a rivet-hole; a further rivet-hole remains in each arm. It seems likely that, instead of being parallel as now, the two arms may originally have been at right angles to each other and may have formed part of a shrine mount. L. of longer arm, 13.4 cm.; W. across arms, externally, 4.2 cm.; W. of each arm, 4 mm.; T. of each arm, 4 mm. (Fig. 31). MEDIAEVAL AND LATER 519 Iron sword. Found at Clogh Castle, Ballymena, Co.

Near each end of the box there is a pair of round holes, one in each of the long sides near the rim. Fastening straps may have pivoted on pegs through these holes. In the centre of the box on each side, from about half-way up to the base, there are the marks of a strap which was fixed by two rivets (of brass or bronze) on each side. As the box, after its discovery in 1952, was used by a local carpenter, whatever strap was here may have been modern. The lid, which is somewhat defective, is flat on one surface, convex on the other; from one of its narrow ends a triangular handle pro jects.
