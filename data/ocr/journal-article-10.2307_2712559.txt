I propose to show that, above all, they reflect the very essence of those works which are "initiatic" both in their nature and form. Each is conceived as a liber mundi, that is, as being the manifestation of the divine and offering the revelation of the divine Wisdom, whatever its nature may be.' Reading thus becomes an initiatic quest leading to the revelation of the origins of life, of the Invisible, which is simultaneously the organizing principle or vital center of the volume = liber mundi = manifestation of the author's cosmic creation. The book contains what the author considers to be the original Word, which has been submerged by the crass materialism of America, the dominance of the White Man and his value system to the detriment and exclusion of those of the Red-Man and the Black Man. The indictment goes beyond America to Christianity, to the institutionaliza- tion of one creed, one truth to the exclusion of all others. To the reader who discovers or rediscovers the "lost Word,"2 the volume becomes * Editorial Note: American Quarterly is pleased to publish this leading example of French work in American Studies.

It corresponds to the apparent visible world, to matter. An intermediate symbolic level deals with the mythic world. There exists yet another hidden dimension, reserved to the few who are willing to patiently work their way through a labyrinth of symbols, key words, signs to the hidden center of the book, where the revelation of the Spirit occurs. The apparent, that is, the external level of the text (the architecture of the books recreates, as we shall see, the form of a sphere containing different layers) corresponds to the profane world. Destructive polariza- tion, fragmentation, sterility, and annihilation characterize it. The internal level evokes the sacred world, marked by wholeness. An intricate set of analogies and concealed correspondences, which unravel gradually in the process of depth reading,4 indicate that every detail, however minute, participates in a meaningful center, be it the scarlet letter or the whale. It constitutes the primordial Whole, out of which all life stems, and which contains the vital principle. Time and space are geographical and historical on the apparent level of the text, and mythic on the hidden one. Superimposed upon each other, they form two entirely separate worlds. On the inner level of the text (= sacred world) time is cyclical and endless; death leads to rebirth and dissolution to a recreation of the cosmic cycle. Time and space are de- picted by means of cyclical and spiral images, the interplay of darkness and light, colors, numbers, and the evocation of geometrical and graphical forms. Cardinal points create mythic space; stars, movements of the sun and moon, and zodiacal signs depict time. The very form and architecture of these two American masterpieces are determined by the passage from the profane level of the text to the sacred one. The labyrinth (maze) functions not only as an important word-symbol, but also, and above all, as an essential element of the formal structure of the book, for the narra- 3The writing of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is intimately linked to the symbolism of the tree. Chapter 63, "The Crotch" (the title enhances the symbol of the principle of life), opens as follows: "Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in productive subjects grow the chapters."

Les Structures anthropologiques de l'imaginaire, Book 2 (Paris: Bor- das, 1969).</page><page sequence="3">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 125 tive is conceived as a path leading through the labyrinth to the hidden cosmic center of the volume. Thus, in the opening chapter of Haw- thorne's romance, the narrative is compared to a "track" emerging out of the "Prison-Door" (the title of ch. 1); it leads to "The Revelation of The Scarlet Letter" (title of ch. 23, preceding "Conclusion"). Reading becomes thus, for an exclusive few,5 a rite of initiation leading to gnosis. The initiate-reader witnesses and participates in the act of creation. The transmission of this gnosis, of the original Word, leads to the spiritual salvation of America.6 The active participation of the reader constitutes an essential device in the form of these works, for through it, he joins in the process of literary creation and, thereby, in the act that repeats archetypal cosmic Creation. By the time the reader, like the minister, emerges from the labyrinth, he discovers "a vast, immeasurable tract of written space behind him" (ch. 20, "The Minister in a Maze," p. 275). The common etymological root of track and tract stresses the relation between the narrative = initiatory reading and the writing of the book itself. In Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, the "twisted tattooing" on the body of the Cannibal, who "in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume, " contains "a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth" (ch. 110, "Queequeg in His Coffin," p. 399). The tattoo- ings are the work of a "departed prophet and seer of his island" described in chapter 12, "Biographical" (read Bio/graphical-the writing of life), as not being "down in any map; true places never are" (p. 56). Its nature is mythical; the preposition in stresses the connection between writing and the inward quest. If the reader follows the "odd little parti-colored squares and triangles" and the "interminable Cretan labyrinth of a fig- ure" (ch. 4, "The Counterpane," p. 32), traced upon the cannibal's arm compared to the patchwork of a counterpane or blanket, he will penetrate 5 In the opening paragraph of "The Custom-House," Hawthorne writes: The truth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him, better than most of his schoolmates and lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation, as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer's own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it.

The author goes on to comment: Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground forfar other delinea- tions. These are hieroglyphical. (ch. 68, "The Blanket," p. 260) These hieroglyphics (hiero = sacred, gluphicos, gluphe = carving) en- graved upon the body of the whale and of Queequeg constitute the sacred signs of the author/Creator. In chapter 68, "The Blanket," the reader not only penetrates beneath the skin of the whale, but he also literally finds himself in the very center of the 135 chapters of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. He is both in the center of the whale and of the volume, the two being essentially one. There he discovers the principle of energy from which all life stems.7 By following the labyrinth formed of squares and triangles, the reader finds himself carried through a spiral movement8 right into the center of The Whale = book, built, as we shall see, in the shape of a circle and a sphere. The numerous references to hieroglyphs and pyramids (formed of squares and triangles) reflect the fascination of Melville's age with Egyp- tology.9 Yet, it is important to understand that the concern with Egyptian and other mythologies and the interest in the pictographic and occult origins and comparative history of different alphabets'0 stimulated such American writers as Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Thoreau, and Whitman to 7 In the center of the whale = the great feminine principle = the archetypal mother, stands the energy of nature: "Of erections, how few are domed like St Peter's" (p. 261); both the image and the vocabulary evoke the phallus. The name of the landlord of The Spouter-Inn, Peter Coffin, acquires a new dimension: he introduces Ishmael into the initiatic chamber; like St Peter, he retains the keys to the sacred death (coffin) and life (the coffin becomes a life-buoy). 8 "Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so it is stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it" (ch. 67, "Cutting-In," p. 258). The middle of the book and of the whale functions also as a refuge. In this context see the remarkable study carried out by the Centre de Recherche sur l'Imaginaire, "Le Refuge," Circe, 2 and 3, 1970, 1972. Note also that such key images in Moby-Dick as the brain, the nut, and the intestines evoke the spiralic labyrinth. 9 For a study of Melville's use of Egyptian mythology, see H. Bruce Franklin, The Wake of the Gods (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1963). 10 Chambers Cyclopaedia, edition of 1792 which Melville owned (cf. Merton M. Sealts, Jr., Melville's Reading: A Checklist of Books Owned and Borrowed [Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1966]), describes each letter together with its numeric value as it appears in different alphabets and languages. Penny Cyclopaedia (1833) carries under the article "Al- phabet" various comparative plates showing the evolution of letters and their corresponding sounds.</page><page sequence="5">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 127 invent a sacred script of their own." These writers were already sen- sitized by the discussions concerning the need of finding another language than English to render the national experience of creating a New World. It is in this context that the use of numerology, intimately linked to the meaning of letters and of geometrical forms, becomes meaningful. They express the author's desire, on the one hand, to bring back to writing its original function, that of giving a sign to the Word, and, on the other, that of creating a script that would incorporate all alphabets, transcending thereby the division of languages and cultures. This script is meant to serve as a remedy against the loss of the primordial Word,'2 the origins of which go beyond Christianity to "unchristian Solomon's wisdom." In The Wisdom of Solomon (1 1:20), which according to Melville is "the truest of all books" (ch. 96, "The Try-Works," p. 355), we read that God made "All things in measure, and number, and weight." In Melville and Haw- thorne, numbers translate the timelessness and ahistoricity of their cosmos. Let us now follow the "lurid gleam" which Hawthorne's hieroglyph, the scarlet letter, throws "along the dark passage-way of the interior" (ch. 3, "The Recognition," p. 82) of the text. * * * The title, The Scarlet Letter, refers both to the book conceived as a sphere, and to the center which generates it. Contrary to the general assumption, the scarlet letter and the letter A are not identical in meaning. A is the apparent form of the scarlet letter. The order and manner in which these two letters are first described indicates the difference. In the narrative, the description of A precedes that of the scarlet letter. Its presentation evokes an involutive spiral movement going from the circumference (bosom) to the center: On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate em- broidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. (ch. 2, "The Market-Place," p. 62) 11 Walter Channing, "Essay on American Language and Literature," Literary Criticism in America, ed. by A. D. V. Nostrand (New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1957), 4. Hawthorne's and Melville's attitude towards writing does not diverge from Emerson's interpretation of languages as emblematic and as being a "grand cipher" ("Nature," Complete Essays and Other Writings [New York: Modern Library], 18). 12 See Jacques Derrida, "Le Pharmacon de Platon," Tel Quel, 32 and 33, 1968, for a study of the Platonic conception of writing as a remedy. 13 The number of chapters (24), the movement of the narrative from bright sunlight of noon to the darkness of midnight and back again into the bright sun, the period of seven years which elapses in the narrative, all indicate that a cyclical conception of time underlies the mythic structure of the book.</page><page sequence="6">128 American Quarterly Flourishes stresses the link between the letter A and the "blackflower of civilized society" (ch. 1, "The Prison-Door," p. 56), that is, the prison and thereby its intimate connection with the canonic law which this "edifice" (aedis = temple + ficium, facere = make) enforces. The scarlet letter is the point from which originates an evolutive spiral movement creating another sphere: But the point which drew all eyes, and as it were, transfigured the wearer ... was that SCARLET LETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It had the effect of aspell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity, and inclosing her in a sphere by herself. (ch. 2, p. 64) The description preceding this quotation reveals the existing link be- tween the scarlet letter and the wild rosebush that "sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted Anne Hutchinson as she entered the prison door." It symbolizes "the deep heart of Nature" (ch. 1, p. 56). Thus right from the outset, the presentation of these two letters offers a clue to Hawthorne's writing: the letter A pertains to the Christian and civilized world (prison) and to the external text. The scarlet letter linked to Nature, to the heart, to wilderness, is the center of a different cosmic order and the sign of the author's sacred writing. The word spell enhances the connection between breath, writing, and magic. The key to the meaning of the scarlet letter resides in the relation between Anne Hutchinson, the Antinomian (word present in the text unlike adultery for which the scarlet letter is supposed to stand) and "the heart of Nature." Antinomian (anti + nomos) signifies anti law; the law it alludes to is the law of the God of the Old Testament, for it is the seventh commandment that has been broken. Once this is realized, the full impli- cations of the words applying to law (be it canonic or secular) and its implementation become clear. Thus the Custom-House of Salem does refer to a historic and biographic reality; but through its very function and geographical position, it operates as a "lieu de passage," both literally and symbolically, between two worlds, the Old and the New. Like the prison, it enforces a set of rules, laws, secular in nature, yet the text also plays on the word custom. "The Custom-House" is described as "Intro- ductory to 'The Scarlet Letter"' which emerges out of it just like the narrative leading to "The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter" does out of "The Prison-Door." Both the Custom-House and the prison function as confining womb symbols, as dark, ponderous matter that petrifies the spirit and obscures or renders dim the light buried in it. They stand for the old order, for the profane world, that of the Puritans, and their canonic law. They symbolize the matter that has to be dissolved so that the Spirit of America, conceived as a new cosmic order, can become manifest.</page><page sequence="7">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 129 The scarlet letter is a "hieroglyph," that is, a sacred mark of another order than that of the Puritans; it stems from a rejection of the mosaic law. It might be the sign of "The Other" with its gnostic connotations, if we take the suggested word adultery in its etymological sense of the introduc- tion of the other. The scarlet letter is the sign of a "tongue unknown" (ch. 12, "The Minister's Vigil," p. 189), a mythic primordial fiery solar tongue, incomprehensible to the non-initiate, a tongue in which Pearl expresses herself in the midnight scene on the scaffold and which the "erudite" Dimmesdale cannot understand at that point. Its nature is closely connected to that of the Red-Men, so intimately linked in their wildness to the wild rose-bush and to Pearl. It is not a coincidence that the minister writes his inspired Election Sermon after he has come back from a visit to Apostle John Eliot, who translated the Bible into an aboriginal tongue. At the end of the novel, the minister voices the Tongue of Flame, but the Spirit he expresses is that of spiritualized Nature. His "words of flame" announcing the creation of the Kingdom of God are voiced in a tongue that transcends the confusion of languages and expresses therefore the Spirit of the Pentecost. The literal language in which the text is clothed, that is, English, corre- sponds to the confusion of languages; it transmits the message of the Christian civilized world, and is incomprehensible to others. Yet, to the initiate, it conceals and permits the form "to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images" (ch. 11, "The Interior of a Heart," p. 170). The opening paragraph of chapter 23, "The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter," shows that the letter represents a whole scale of sounds, linked to the four cosmic elements. The eloquent voice, on which the souls of the listening audience, had been borne aloft, as on the swelling waves of the sea, at length came to a pause. There was a momentary silence, profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles. Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed tumult; as if the auditors, released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of another's mind, were returning into themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In a moment more, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church. Now that there was an end, they needed other breath, more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame, and had burdened with the richfragrance of his thought. (p. 302) The "words of flame" so intimately linked to the "fragrance" of the "delicate gems" of the "wild rose-bush" presented to the reader "on the threshold of our narrative" (ch. 1, "The Prison-Door," pp. 56-57) express</page><page sequence="8">130 American Quarterly the process of cosmic creation and the spiritualization of matter. The Scarlet Letter refers thus to the Word, the sign, and the book. It is the "speaking book."" The Scarlet Letter is the mark and the book of the Black Man, that is, of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The one "among [the] many morals" which the author draws from the minister's tale corresponds to that "sweet moral blossom" which the wild rose offers us on the "threshold" (ch. 1, p. 57) of the narrative. Reminis- cent of the Rosicrucian symbol, it stands right at the outset of the book, yet the reader has to undergo an initiatic quest to acquire the knowledge it symbolizes. It reads: "Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred." (ch. 24, "Conclusion," p. 316) The number of letters and words in this sentence (three-fold repetition of a sentence formed of six letters, followed by 18 words) conceals a numerologic pattern revealing that 666, that is, the number of the beast of The Book of Revelation constitutes this trait.15 The narrative-track (etymologically cognate with tract and trait) has led the reader to partici- pate in the creation of "the vast immeasurable tract of written space" of the new cosmic order in which the beast constitutes the "trait". In esoteric lore, the number 666 is linked to the sun, and to the cult of Baal; the function of the sun, so important in this text, acquires thus a deeper meaning. The fire of the scarlet letter is a celestial one, but it partakes of pagan nature, of the wildness of love (Amor), of the heart. It can only be seen in its full import by the initiate (that is, the initiated reader). To him "It was revealed," but like all that pertains to the sacred, it was "irreverent to describe the revelation" (ch. 23, "The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter," p. 311). The sacred signs, that is, the sacred writing of The Scarlet Letter, are, symbolically speaking, of the color of the vital flow of blood (so impor- tant an image in the book), of that of the heart (as opposed to the mind), of the wildness of the Red-Man (as opposed to the civilization of the White Man). The title page of the first Boston edition, with its SCARLET LET- TER in bold red type, enhances this. It expresses the mythic Adamic (Adam signifying red) tongue. Hawthorne's technique is the reverse of the one used by John Eliot in his translation of the Bible into Algonquian. 14 Henry Corbin, 45. 15 For other concealed references to the beast and to The Book of Revelation of Saint John, see my paper "The Scarlet Letter: An Initiatory Reading," to be published in the Acts of the XVIIth Congress of the S.A.E.S. held at Tours, in May, 1977.</page><page sequence="9">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 131 Because it was an oral Indian language, he transcribed the Algonquian sounds with the letters of the English alphabet. The result to the English reader is that of apparently meaningful signs conveying meaningless words. Hawthorne (and Melville) use letters and words apparently mean- ingful to the reader which conceal signs that have to be deciphered, so that the "words of flame," expressive of Nature,16 can be heard and read. Does this mean that Hawthorne's cosmology glorifies the beast? By no means. The book is conceived as a vessel in which the alchemical process of transmutation occurs.17 The matter that is submitted to the process of spiritualization is that of American reality, that of the Puritan world. It is also the black lettered text on its apparent external level dealing with the Christian world, which is as important a component of The Scarlet Letter as the wild spirit it stands for in the esoteric discourse. It is only through a gradual dissolution of this matter or substance or text that the imprisoned primordial light and spirit can become manifest.18 The Scarlet Letter be- comes thus the manifestation of a cosmic order which effects the fusion of myths from different cultures and above all stands for the coincidentia oppositorum of the fundamental dichotomies of American culture: civilization/wilderness, Christian/heathen, the White Man/the Red Man, the Black Man. The historical and cultural dimension of the characters-Hester, Dimmesdale, Pearl, and Chillingworth-dissolve and give place to figures reenacting different myths of cosmic creation. Hester is the Adulteress, the Babylonian whore of The Book of Revelation; she also is the Virgin 16 Sacvan Bercovitch, The Puritan Origins of the American Self (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1975), quarrels with Perry Miller's view that the romantics saw Nature as the Ameri- can Temple; he argues that "they saw America as the temple of nature, and then, not a temple in the topological sense, as a general moral guide, but in the exegetical "full sense," as christology and sacred history combined" (p. 152; my italics). 17 The wild rose standing at the threshold of the narrative symbolizes the alchemical redeemer, the coincidentia oppositorum between spirit and soul, fire and water, sun and moon. Such is also the meaning of Pearl linked through her name to the female symbolic cluster water-moon-white color and through her description to the male cluster: fire-sun- red. The closing sentence of the book. ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A GULES contains the three colors in the proper order of the magnum opus black, white and red (gules, from Old Fr. goules = ermine, hence white, dyed red). 18 Gray, the first hue in the opening sentence of the narration, in its context signifies sadness, age, and constraint; the recurrence of the consonantal group gr reinforces the statis. As the narration proceeds, gray appears in conjunction with light and sunlight, till it dawns upon the reader that the ray of light is present from the outset-g/ray-but im- mobilized by the heaviness and opacity of matter. The image "gray, steeple-crowned hats" (p. 55) acquires a new meaning: its shape evokes the triangular form of the letter A; crown evokes the cabalistic Keter (=crown, law) linked to the Hebrew aleph and symbolizing the Hidden of Hiddens.</page><page sequence="10">132 American Quarterly Mary,19 and Dimmesdale is the Holy Ghost, and Pearl20 their androgyn- ous offspring. Yet, in Hawthorne's cosmology, Satan-Chillingworth- participates in the creative process.21 Dimmesdale also carries reminis- cences of the legend of the ray of light which penetrates the shell (Mother) to give birth to the Pearl. He also contains a particle of the gnostic Light or Spirit obscured and muffled by the engrossing matter of his body and wanders like a stranger on the terrestrial earth, till he can discard his bodily envelope.22 Hawthorne is not in full command of his text; the ambiguity, so striking in this book, and commonly attributed to his mixed feelings towards the Puritan heritage, is also ambivalence towards his own thoughts and self. His writing often lapses into platitudes and shallow didacticism. Melville seems to have grasped the very essence of the problem in his comment to their mutual friend Duyckinck that "there is something lacking-a good deal lacking-to the plump sphericity of the man," and adds: "he needs roast-beef, done rare." 23 Unlike Hawthorne, Melville comes to terms with himself and realizes the full implications of what he is writing. His is the terrible solitude of the artist who cannot, as he complains, be entirely frank with his reader.24 At least he can be frank with himself or with his "bosom friend," Haw- thorne, to whom he dedicates Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, and confesses "I have written a wicked book, and feel spotless as the lamb. "25 His complaint to his friend- "though I wrote the Gospels in this century, I should die in the gutter" 26-voiced at the height of the creation of Moby-Dick, reveals that Melville's "gospel cetology" ("Extracts," p. 2) is the Gospel of the Leviathan. Though Melville cannot be frank with the reader, he incites him by means of hints dispersed throughout the text, to follow the clues that lead to the sanctum sanctorum of his liber mundi. '9 Virgin, Mary, and Queen are key words in the sacred writing of Moby-Dick. They connote the fertile virgin land and mother and, in the case of Moby-Dick, the non-existence of a spiritual Father, of anything else than matter. 20 Sea and water constitute the undertone of the minister's voice, and are key images in the book. 21 Cf.

He is a direct descendant of the Puritans who, as Sacvan Bercovitch puts it, "conceived of reality, in accordance with their concept of the unity of knowledge, as a system of linked analogies, inter- lacing every strand of recorded experience, ancient and modem, scientific and humanistic no less than theological." 28 Besides the workable experi- ence which he acquired while writing Mardi (1848), entirely structured, as Maxine Moore has brilliantly proved, upon an astrological and astronomi- cal game,29 there is no doubt that Melville possessed a profound sense of the quality of numbers, so frequent in poets. Critical evidence points to the gradual growth of the book. In a recent essay, Harrison Hayford argues most convincingly that even Ahab, Queequeg, and Ishmael are late additions in the process of creation.30 When Melville set off to write what must have begun as a whaling adven- ture, everything predisposed him to grasp the whale as a cosmic symbol. As he dove deeper and deeper into his own unconscious and into the writing, the overall pattern must have emerged. To add details, to re- arrange the materials already written, change their disposition, add a paragraph, change details, count words and letters, etc., is feasible in a very short period of time. 27 See my book La Contre-Bible de Melville-Moby Dick dechiffre (Paris: Mouton, 1975), for a description of the different elements of the code. The text carries various hints pointing to the existence of a numeric code: for instance, Pythagoras is referred to twice in carefully coded passages; the name T. Browne, who made wide use of numerology, is appended to the 19th extract and to chapter 91 linked to 16 (the number upon which the structure of the book rests) through inversions in a mirror. Possibly, the reading of Shakespeare, deeply impreg- nated by Pythagorean cosmology and Rosicrucian symbolism (cf. S. K. Heninger Jr., Touches of Sweet Harmony: Pythagorean Cosmology and Renaissance Poetics [San Marino: The Huntingdon Library, 1974]; also Frances A. Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlight- enment [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972], and Shakespeare's Last Plays [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975]), in the midst of writing Moby-Dick may have helped to crystallize this esoteric form. 28 Sacvan Bercovitch, The American Puritan Imagination, Essays in Revaluation (Lon- don: Cambridge Univ.

However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation" (ch. 32, "Cetology," p. 119). Elsewhere, in a chapter significantly dealing with law, he appar- ently describes a "whaling code" elaborated in Holland, but in reality, he is referring to his own code when he says: But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it. (ch. 89, "Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish," p. 331) The code can be reduced to a series of signs and their reflection in a mirror. The author even, jokingly, tells us that "While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me" (ch. 85, "The Fountain," p. 313). The mirror is the key both to Melville's cosmology in which the Invisi- ble is nothing else but the inverted image of the visible and of his writing.31 The book contains a variety of mirrors, the most important ones being the constantly moving sea, water, and the doubloon. The whale itself is an anthropomorphic mirror. The narrator even hints that the transparent membrane isinglass that covers the whale might be used to read Moby- Dick; or, The Whale: I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whalebooks. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. (p. 259) Just as the mirror of Pythagoras is linked to writing, so the Melvillean mirrors and glasses decompose the apparent text and evoked forms, to create new ones through all sorts of combinations. Essentially they serve to reduce the multiple figures and totally diverse objects and signs to the Whole, which in the Melvillean cosmos is the formlessness of naught. In chapter 99, "The Doubloon," the Pequod's second mate, Stubb, gazes at the cabalistic inscriptions on the gold coin nailed to the mast; it is 31 Chapter 1, "Loomings" introduces the function of water as a cosmic mirror: "medita- tion and water are wedded for ever" (p. 13); or referring to the story of Narcissus: "But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all" (p. 14).</page><page sequence="13">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 135 worth 16 dollars. His exclamation echoes the well-known biblical phrase "signs and wonders" indicating that we are in fact dealing with signs of the divine: "Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist-hark! By Jove, I have it." (p. 361) This apparently meaningless exclamatory phrase conceals the key to Melville's gospel. Chapter 43, of hardly any import to the narration, is entitled "Hark! " It opens with the word Hist; the last sentence begins with its metathesis Tish. Moreover, the sum of all numbers referred to in this chapter (the indefinite pronoun one included) is 61, that is, the transposition of the digits of number 16. "Hist-hark! By Jove, I have it." The planet Jupiter is the seal of the magic square of 4 (= 16). If we add horizontally, vertically, or along diagonals the numbers inscribed in this magic square, we obtain the sum 34. The number of the chapter entitled "Hark!" is 43, the trans- position of the digits of 34. The sum of all the numbers contained in the magic square of 4 is 136; Moby-Dick; or, The Whale has 135 chapters plus the "Epilogue. " 32 Moreover, this particular magic square figures in Diirer's print Melen- colia. Durer is referred to as that "fine old Dutch savage" (ch. 57, "Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood, in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars," p. 232; I do not follow the correction introduced by the Norton edition; the import of the error will be discussed further on), in a passage which compares different forms of signs to a "Latin lexicon." The text does not mention this particular print, though it is clear that the author had it in mind, for it is in chapter 16 that the word melancholy (so sparsely and carefully used in the text and evoking one of its dominant themes) appears for the first time. What is the meaning of this esoteric game? Chapter 97, "The Lamp," evoking the symbolic connotations of light and knowledge, ends on the 32 Chapter 25, "Postscript," does not figure in the English edition The Whale which has only 134 chapters. The title Post/script indicates that it is a late addition. The implications are that it was in the final stage of creation that Melville became aware of the possible relations between the magic square of 4, the theme of melancholy, and the name of the narrator. Moreover, the chapter in question follows a paragraph on writing: "if at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling (ch. 24, "The Advocate," p. 101). "The Honor and Glory of Whaling" is the title of chapter 82, which describes in the opening sentence the technique of the author's writing: "There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method" (p. 304).</page><page sequence="14">136 American Quarterly word game, indicating that gnosis is to be found by playing Melville's game of creation. It will reveal that the Invisible is but the reversed image of the visible. Symbolically speaking, the square represents the terrestrial: by having a magic square underlie the structure of his whole book, that is, his Gospel, the author conveys the message that it is the terrestrial and not the celestial that constitutes the basis of all existence. Out of this terres- trial square (with its sum of 136) he wants to create a circle inverting the problem of the squaring of the divine circle to which he refers in chapter 80, "The Nut." The circle is never completed, for in the "Epilogue," which takes the place of the 136th chapter, a spiralic movement carries the narrator right back to the center, and everything begins anew: Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst. . . . (p. 470, Melville's italics) The image of the black button evokes the scene where Queequeg, "the Cannibal," compares the signs of the doubloon to a mark tattooed upon his body: "And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh-I guess it's Sagittarius or the Archer. No: he don't know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers." (ch. 99, "The Doub- loon," p. 362) Sagittarius, the zodiacal sign linked to Jupiter, stresses the link with the magic square of 4; the "button-like black bubble" from which Ishmael is reborn stands for the black sun, the sun that Queequeg thinks "is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels." Its colour is that of the black squares tattooed upon Queequeg's skin described as we have seen as "an interminable Cretan labyrinth." Black also brings to mind Melencolia (melas = black) with its magic square. Melville indeed refers to another of Dfirer's prints, Melancthon (Melville's erroneous spelling) and para- phrases Dfirer's inscription as follows "God: done this day by my hand" (ch. 79, "The Praire," p. 292-we do not follow Norton's correction of the error in the title; praire for prairie phonetically evokes prayer). The implications are clear: God is a manmade creation. Such is the meaning to the clue of the book: "Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You'll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts." (ch. 99, "The Doubloon," pp. 360-61)</page><page sequence="15">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 137 Once this is understood, the religious implication of the errors so abun- dant in this book emerges. Looking at the doubloon, Flask, the third mate, says: "It is worth sixteen dollars, that's true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty cigars." (P. 361) The mistake of 160 cigars too many, or 320 cents too few, serves to call the reader's attention to the importance of the number 16 in this chapter and in the underlying structure of the book. It points to the fact that truth is to be found in error, the cosmic error committed by the Demiurge, the Creator of the gnostics. Melville's message reads that no primordial Spirit or Light exists, that all life stems from matter. Hist and tish, anagrams of shit, refer us to the precious ambergris, the mystic rose of Melville's cosmology found in the bowels of a blasted whale. The excrement, the filth so abhorred by Christian religion and, in particular, by Protestants, becomes the symbol of the coincidentia oppositorum of chased and being chased, of devouring and being devoured. The image of the sharks biting at their own disembowelments "till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth" evoke through their form the gnostic Ouroboros; theirs is the "generic or Pantheistic vitality" (ch. 66, "The Shark Massacre," p. 257) of Melville's cosmology in which matter in its basest form is sacralized. The cornerstone of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is "the castaway," that is, everything that has been cast away by the Judeo-Christian culture, be it the cannibal, the Black Man, the wild Indian, the Mohammedan, Cain, Belial, the devil, Typhon, the leviathan, Rahab, Sodom and Gomorrah, the phallic idols, the golden calf, the body, filth, and so on. Ishmael, the biblical narrator, personifies them all. His name is linked to the hidden architecture of the book, for his story is told in chapter 16 of The Book of Genesis. He is the son of Abram, whose wife Sarai, being barren, offered her Egyptian handmaid to her husband so that he might conceive a son by her. When Abram was 99 years old, God made a Covenant within him, in token of which a son by his lawful wife was promised to him; the letter h or ha in English was added to his name. All men in his household were circumcised; Ishmael was then 13 years old. Thus, in the consciousness of the Melvillean Ishmael, the letter h or ha (so abundant in the narration), the numbers 16, 17, 13, and 99, the existence of a mother and a stepmother (referred to in ch. 4, "The Counterpane"), the Egyptian lineage, and the act of circumci- sion are intrinsically related to his rejection, to the separation between him and his brother, the heir, the elect of pure racial origins, the fruit of a sanctioned spiritual union as opposed to a carnal one.</page><page sequence="16">138 American Quarterly The book opens with "Etymology," that is, with the apparent intention of giving the original Word; yet numerous indications point to the con- trary. It is supplied by a late consumptive usher to a grammar school, who lacked creative breath. He kept dusting the lexicons "of all the known nations of the world" implying the existence of unknown ones. There follows a quotation by Hakluyt which reads: "While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true." (p. 1) The letter H is associated with our tongue and culture, to the detriment of other tongues, perhaps those that preceded the confusion of languages that occured at the tower of Babel. The word whale is listed in 13 different languages; their number evokes the age at which Ishmael was circumcised in token of Abraham's accept- ance of the Almighty God to the detriment of all other idols. It becomes thus clear that "Etymology" (Etumos = true + logos = word) presents but the apparent vision of the whale, and of the Word. The famous opening sentence of the narration, "Call me Ishmael," shows that the narrator has assumed a name which does not really trans- late his identity. Only after having been initiated by a cannibal, after having salaamed and kissed the nose of Queequeg's phallic idol, after having discovered that "Nothing exists in itself' and that "darkness" is "the proper element of our essences" (ch. 11, "Nightgown," p. 55), does the narrator accept himself, exclaiming "I, Ishmael," in Chapter 16 (p. 66). Chapter 17, "The Ramadan," offers the sacred ritual of a cannibal savage squatting on his hams with a phallic idol on his head and celebrat- ing the holy day of the Mahometans. The coexistence of different creeds contrasts with the Covenant as described in chapter 17 of the Book of Genesis. Similarly chapter 99, "The Doubloon," so intimately linked, as we have seen, to the number 16 and thereby to the biblical Ishmael, evokes through its number the age of Abram just before the Covenant. ("And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be thou perfect." ) 33 "The Doubloon" offers a vision of the whole such as it existed before Abram accepted the separation of men into perfect and non-perfect, into the chosen race and the others, which brought about the division of nations. Had not God predicted that Abraham would be "the father of many nations" 34 while of Ishmael he said "I will make him a 33 Gen. 17: 1; my italics. 34 Ibid., 17:5; my italics.</page><page sequence="17">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 139 great nation" ? In the "Epilogue," Melville's narrator is reborn the father of a new cosmos that has abolished all distinctions introduced by the Holy Covenant. Thus, in its form, Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is an initiatic book. Yet Melville's gnosis denies the existence of anything else than matter in constant movement. Therein lies Ahab's tragedy. He refuses to accept his leviathanic origins; it is he who pits himself against Moby Dick, the primordial mother principle = the Leviathan = Rahab, and then sets off on his mad quest of the White Whale, the father he will never find, for he does not exist.36 Only matter, chaos, and Moby-Dick; or, The Whale exist. The fact that the equivalent in the title does not read the White Whale is highly revealing.37 Melville's "Cetology" (ch. 32), so full of "leviathanic revelations" (p. 116), offers the key to this enigma of the title. The Right Whale is indiscriminately designated by "the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale" (p. 121); the word titles and the capital T in the definite article qualifying Whale point to the relation with the title Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is the Green/land Whale evoking the ver- dant "insular Tahiti ... encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life" (ch. 58, "Brit," p. 236), the mythic green island of truth which man discovers in his quest. It is the Black Whale, which is also the Great Whale, the True Whale, the Right Whale. The apparent error of reproduc- ing the figure of a Right Whale instead of that of a Sperm Whale on the spine of the English edition of The Whale hardly thus seems to be the printer's mistake. No essential distinction exists between the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale. The image of the circumference/center, so important in the book, expresses their relation.38 The "Greenland or 35 Ibid., 17:20; my italics. 36 "God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates" (ch. 44, "The Chart," p. 175). In his elemental fight, Ahab loses both a leg and a letter to his name for his hidden essence is Rahab. Concealing the sacred unpronounceable name behind apparent ones is one of Melville's devices. Thus, in "The Honor and Glory of Whaling" (see note 32) he says: "Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head-waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves" (p. 306). 37 The existing proof of the title page of the American edition (I am indebted to Harrison Hayford for this information) bearing the same title as the English edition, that is, The Whale, shows that Melville introduced last minute changes. For a reading of the typographi- cal disposition of the title, see La Contre-Bible de Melville, 93. 38 "Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,-the Greenland whale is deposed,- the great sperm whale now reigneth" (ch. 32,</page><page sequence="18">140 American Quarterly right-whale" (p. 117; note capitalization and hyphen) constitutes the center, the Sperm Whale being the circumference. The same is true for the relation black = center/white = circumference. The essence of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale (referring both to the whale from which all life stems and to the volume) is darkness. Like the white man who is nothing "more dignified than a whitewashed negro" (ch. 13, "The Wheelbarrow," p. 60), Moby Dick's whiteness conceals "the blackness of darkness." 39 Similarly "the Holy one that sitteth there white like wool" in "the Vision of Saint John," as described in the 18th (= 6 + 6 + 6) phrase of the famous paragraph discussing the "Whiteness of the Whale" (ch. 42, p. 164), conceals the blackness of the number of the beast.40 Knowledge of the fundamental double nature of the Universe and the nonexistence of a primordial Spirit leads to the salvation of the narrator. He has learned to transcend the division among languages and has redis- covered the sacred primordial unwritten tongue. "Unlettered Ishmael" has deciphered and read the mystical signs inscribed onto the "awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow" (ch. 79, "The Praire," p. 293). The cannibal's coffin, bearing a copy of the tattooings imprinted onto Queequeg's body and comporting "a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth (p. 399)," is the cradle of Ishmael become according to the biblical prophecy "a wild man." 41 He is picked up by a ship bearing the name of Rachel, so fre- quently symbolizing America in the writings of the Puritans.42 The prophet of America, of the new cosmic order, is reborn an orphan (last word of the text) for no father exists. Echoing the famous verse of the Book of Job, "And I only am escaped alone to tell thee" (p. 470), he transmits to the world by means of hieroglyphic signs the Word of the Cannibal, of Nature, of the Leviathan, of the Serpent. Such is the meaning of the word FINIS appended to the text and appar- ently contradicting the author's famous assertion: "Cetology," p. 118). The reference to Charing Cross, the geometric center of Old London, conceals the image of center/circumference. The use of capitals indicates the subordinate role of the sperm whale, whose existence is linked to time (See La Contre-Bible, 50-51, for the pattern of transformation of parmacetti-*Sperm Whale inscribed into "Extracts"). 39 This phrase occurs twice in the text; it alludes to Sodom, Gomorrah, Cain, and other abominations as described in Jude, 6-13. 40 The two references to St. John conceal a relation with the number of the beast. St. John is mentioned in the chapter entitled "The Pacific," its number ( 111) being linked to the magic square of 6, in which the sum of all inscribed numbers is 666. Chapter 42, "The Whiteness of the Whale," so imbibed with mythological allusions, makes no explicit reference to Egypt (=black land in biblical terms) yet through a cross set of allusions, it constantly sends us back to passages concerning Egypt, thus offering a perfect illustration of Melville's technique of writing. 41 Gen. 16:12. 42 Cf. Sacvan Bercovitch, The Puritan Origins of the American Self, 156.</page><page sequence="19">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 141 I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished.... For small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. (ch. 32, "Cetology," p. 127) Read backwards (in a certain way) FINIS means IS IN F. Young's article on Egypt published in the 1838 Appendix to the Encyclopaedia Britannica points to the correspondence between the hieroglyph of the homed serpent and the letter F. Melville's "Cetology" (logos of the Cetus) contains the Word of the Whale-he presents his "Bibliographical system" or writing of the Bible in the cetological subchapter "Fin-Back" (Back in F). Like the shadow that moves back on "Ahaz-dial" (p. 122) it carries us back in a leftwards writing translating the undoing of history and civilization to the Word of the Serpent, to "unchristian Solomon's wisdom" of which the "wilful world hath not got hold of ... yet" (ch. 96, "The Try-Works," p. 355). The end of the book becomes the beginning, reminding us of the car- penter's complaint of doing "a cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end" (ch. 126, "The Life-Buoy," pp. 430-3 1).43 To the initiate, "Etymology" offers the Word of the Levi- athan. The errors it contains-the apparent printing mistake of a redupli- cated heading at the top of the opposite page44; the misspelled Greek equivalent for whale signifies fault, lack; the Hebrew word is meaningless unless the missing K45 is discovered forming the cabalistic word Keter = crown, divine law 46-offer a key to Melville's secret writing and its mes- sage. They read that truth is to be found in error and that what the gnostics consider to be the cosmic error of Creation is the only truth. Unravelling the author's elaborate code upon which his sacred writing is based leads to the existential discovery of naught.47 Nothing exists beyond the appa- rent, visible world, and the Invisible is but the inversion of the visible, 4 Chapter 68, "The Blanket" is, as we have seen, the middle of the book; yet, it is also the end of the involutive spiral movement. Moby-Dick is structured on the principle of double and triple (see La Contre-Bible, 32); if we take the 135 chapters and the "Epilogue" and fold the book in two, like the Folio of Melville's "cetological System," then chapter 68, "The Blanket," and "Epilogue" form respectively the end of the involutive spiral movement and the beginning of the evolutive one. 44 See Harrison Hayford, "Unnecessary Duplicates." 45 K is the missing letter in the Hebrew word "Etymology" (cf. La Contre-Bible, 68) signifying Keter = crown. It implies that the Hidden of Hiddens is the whale. 46 The Scarlet Letter rejects the purely spiritual origin of creation; Melville denies it entirely. The "crown" is to be found on the Right Whale's head, close to the "two f- shaped spout-holes" (ch. 75, "The Right Whale's Head-Contrasted View," p. 282). The whole imagery stresses the fertility mother cult. 47 The correspondence between the doubloon described as a possible "empty cipher" and naught/not aught/, and thereby belonging to the realm of formlessness, of chaos, is to be noted.</page><page sequence="20">142 American Quarterly that is, of matter.48 With "an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face," the author, assuming the name of the Hyena Whale better known as "the Black Fish, so called because blackness is the rule among all whales" (ch. 32, "Cetology," p. 124), tells us: There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own. (ch. 49, "The Hyena," p. 195) The wit (etymologically cognate of wisdom) which the initiate reader finally discerns is that Melville's sacred writing translates the very dynamics of matter-life-truth; it cannot be reduced to formulae. The spout of the whale described as a "spiracle" (p. 310) and compared to a "foun- tain," with all the sacred connotations it bears, expresses this endless movement which leads nowhere. The "Cretan labyrinth" of Melville's writing is "interminable" (p. 32). That is the great joke played by the author/Creator upon his reader/man. * * * The question arises whether this initiatic form of writing is unique to The Scarlet Letter and Moby-Dick, or whether the patterns here described represent certain invariables of the predominantly Protestant white American imagination, of what Jean Duvignaud would term an "ecologi- cal niche." 49 I have shown elsewhere that the apposition of the profane and the sacred offers a key to the understanding of American writings in which the myth of America, i.e., the myth of the creation of a new world or re- creation of the world, constitutes, overtly or not, the underlying theme.50 These conclusions stem from the analysis of a limited number of ro- mances and short stories but they apply as well to Walden or Leaves of Grass, or The Bridge, for in such a perspective the distinction between literary genres does not seem essential. The origins of this cosmological literary form can be traced back to the Puritans' "ideology," 51 to the vision they had of being the Chosen People 48 See Gilbert Durand, 225-68 for the relation between the symbols of inversion and the night pattern of images, and their link to colors. 49 Jean Duvignaud, "La pratique de l'imaginaire," Les Imaginaires (Paris: Uhion Generale d'Editions, 1976), 435. 50 Works already cited; also The Myth of America: Essays in the Structures of Literary Imagination (Hague: Mouton, 1973); Le Blanc et le Noir chez Melville et Faulkner (ed.), (Paris: Mouton, 1974).

Press, 1970).</page><page sequence="21">The Gnosis of Hawthorne and Melville 143 encumbered with the mission of creating a New Canaan, to the way they would translate the terrestrial into the divine, transform Geography into Christianography, project the life of an individual against a supernatural fabric, transform a historical character into an exemplum exemplorum. The roots are deeply anchored in the Bible and in its hermeneutics, which insisted that the literal text of the Scriptures concealed a transcendent meaning, in the interest of the Protestants for Christian hermeticism, heretical writings, Gnosticism, and neoplatonic thought. Just as everyday affairs concealed signs of Divine Providence, and the world of natural phenomena revealed the "handwriting of God" to the Protestants, so the hidden text of The Scarlet Letter, Moby-Dick, and others reveals the word/Word of the author/Creator. This form draws upon the Puritan rhetoric with its theory that style, in order to express the Word, should recover its original simplicity. This to a large extent ac- counts for the writers' use of the etymological meaning of words in their sacred discourse. Just as etymology was to the Puritans "a form of exegesis, a clue to sacred signs," so to Hawthorne and Melville, it is an essential formal device indicative of their return to the primordial sacred language. To this should be added the impact of what Howard Mumford Jones termed "The Great Debate" 52 on the nature of American literature. As I have already said, it made the American writer sensitive to the impor- tance of form in the expression of the national experience. I believe that the originality and greatness of American mid-nineteenth century literary writings compared to those of South American countries is greatly in- debted to this debate. True, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Thoreau did not follow Walter Channing's extreme suggestion that American writ- ers discard the English language, expressive of an old, corrupt (read pro- fane) world, and create a tongue of their own, by adopting an Indian one, to translate the spirit of the New World.53 Yet, out of the old materials the English language-they did, like Thot, Hermes, or Enoch invent a script which would translate the Word of the new cosmic order, and created an art capable of rendering the painful and arduous process of creating the New World.* 52 Howard Mumford Jones, The Theory of American Literature (Ithaca: Cornell Univ.
