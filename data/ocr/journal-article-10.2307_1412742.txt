<plain_text><page sequence="1">LITERATURE. Outlines of Metaphysics, by J. S. MACKENZIE. Published by Macmil- lan and Co., New York and London, 1902. The book is a study of the problems of metaphysics from the stand- point of the philosophical thought of the day. It centers round the problems relating to experience, and advances a step on Bradley in that it is enabled through its use of the genetic method to gain through the idea of the becoming of experience a new light on experience, not more experience, perhaps, but more significance in experience. And then after a thorough study of experience by the genetic method, bring- ing out all its phases, he studies the forms of the constructive activity, as they build up their interpretations of experience, from the stand- point of the whole of experience. The work opens up with a provisional definition of metaphysics, namely, it is the science that seeks to deal with experience as a whole, or rather as a systematic unity. After discussing the special sciences, showing how all deal with only a part of experience, he changes his definition of metaphysics by saying metaphysics is the science which seeks to take a comprehensive view of experience with the view of understanding it as a systematic whole, by experience understanding the experience of an individual yet an experience common to all, indi- vidual yet universal. With the seeming fundamental duality of expe- rience, of subject and object, mind and matter, and on the other hand with its equally seeming unity arises the first great problem of meta- physics, namely, that of their reconciliation. Some attempts have been Dualism, Inonism, Agnosticism, Materialism, Idealism, Trans- cendentalism. What we want, says MacKenzie, is not a Theory of Knowledge but a Theory of Experience. What we want, then, is a method which will enable us to arrive at the solution of our prob- lem mentioned above. (a) Early dialectic method, (b) dogmatic meth- od, (c) psychological method, (d) critical method, (e) later dialectic method have been tried and found wanting, and since we want to study experience from the point of view of its becoming as well as what it becomes, and also since it was the method led up to by the develop- ment of both ancient and modern philosophy Aristotle and Hegel; and since it keeps us in touch with the coticrete content of experience the genetic method seems by far the best; therefore it will be our method. We wish to consider ist the genesis of experience, asking two questions: (a) how does experience of a world grow up? (b) the significance of the various elements in its development? Before answering the two ques- tions let us restate our problem. The problem is to try to understand the general significance of our experience as a whole by observing the process of its development. In answer to the first question we would say, we have (a) the simple emergence of a manifold content in con- sciousness. This content is always somehow presented within a unity but there need not be any conscious reference to such unity, the presence of the unity being shown in that the content presented is not bare or cold but has always an effective side, (b) this consciousness of harmony or dissonance is seen, on reflection, to be connectedwith changes that take place from within in the content of our experience. In answer to ques-</page><page sequence="2">LITERATURE. tion two we have the three elements (a) simple presentation in con- sciousness, (b) feeling, (c) conscious activity; simple presentation be- ing the most significant in the first stage, feeling in the second stage, conscious activity in the third stage; and, as the third stage is the most important, and since it is to thought experience we must hope for met- aphysical enlightenment, conscious activity is the most important and most significant element. The three stages of development are (a) sensation, (b) perception, (c) conception. Nine problems seem to be in- volved in sense-experience, seven in perception, four in thought. While all the problems of the two lower stages are involved in the highest stage (thought), the advantage of rising to this problem through a genetic study lies mainly in the fact that it enables us to put the whole of our material before ourselves in proper perspective. Meta- physics is the criticism by thought of its own constructions, thought being considered as the culminating point in the general process of experience. The chief value of a genetic survey lies chiefly in the fact that it enables us to have definitely before our minds a connected view of experience as a concrete whole. Again it abolishes the fundamental distinction between mind and matter, and the apparent fundamental antithesis between apparent duality and equally apparent unity of ex- perience, for both the world of mind and matter are ideal constructions. What we have to do is to take mind and matter as elements in the totality of our experience and try to see what place belongs to each with- in the concrete system of our world. Most fundamental antithesis is that between the That and the What. Yet nowhere in our experience have we pure Thatness or pure Whatness. The development of experience is from the less to the more determinate by the introduction of more and more definite constructive forms. We have certain constructive activities involved in experience. As it is, the problem of metaphysics is that of considering and criticising the whole work of these. Accordingly, the question for metaphysics is (a) What are the fund- atnental forms of construction in the building up of our experience? (b) How far is each of these forms coherent in itself and capable of be- ing worked out? The forms of construction are (i) Perceptual, (2) Sci- entific Construction, (3) Ethical Construction, (4) AEsthetic Construc- tion, (5) Religious Construction, (6) Speculative Construction. The second question is answered in particular in the remaining part of the book and his conclusions summed up as follows. There are certain difficulties in the constitution of human knowledge but at the same time there are indefinite possibilities of gradually removing such difficulties, or at least reducing them to a minimum. Take any con- struction by itself and it fails, take it in relation to the whole, for ex- perience is an organic whole, and we may reasonably believe it does not fail. The book I wish to commend very highly, ist because it real- izes the ideal Prof. MacKenzie had in mind when he wrote it, for it was to be a book for the student just beginning seriously to face the prob- lems of metaphysics. It lays out the problems in a clear manner be- fore the student so that he knows what he faces and from what sources these problems rise. 2nd, for his use of the genetic method, the best possible method to gain a complete insight into the significance of experience. 3rd, for his recognition of the claims of all the construct- ive activities contained in experience. The plan of the book is admira- ble. It is the best book of its kind I have ever come in contact with. My only criticism would be that Dr. MacKenzie in one or two places has asked questions and then failed to give definite answers. He seems to have wandered away into something else. R. M. MOORE. Kant's Prolegomena. Edited by Dr. Paul Carus. Published by Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago, 1902. A new translation of Kant's Prolegomena, by Dr. Paul Carus, with 320</page><page sequence="3">an Essay on Kant's Philosophy by Dr. Carus, and supplementary materials for the study of Kant's life and philosophy, consisting of estimates of different phases of Kant's philosophy by Windleband, Weber, Schwegler, Lange and others. An exceedingly valuable book, enabling us to grip the essentials of Kant's philosophy. Dr. Carus has rendered a great service to English students of Kant in this book. Leibniz Discourse on Metaphysics, Correspondence with Arnauld, Monadology. Translated from the originals by Dr. George R. Montgomery. Published by the Open Court Publishing Co., Chi- cago, Nov.-Dec., I90I. Dr. Montgomery, by translating these parts of Leibniz's works, has enabled the English student of philosophy unable to read French, to study the Leibnizian philosophy from the genetic standpoint, thereby enabling him to grasp the true significance of the monadology through a study of his earlier writings. The translations are exceedingly well done, and the introduction by Paul Janet illuminates the pages fol- lowing. A Scientific Philosophy the Harbinger of a Scientific Theory; or, Steps to Philosophical and Theological Unity. Swan Sonnenschein and Co., London, I90I. pp. 24I. The writer's effort is to show that the old Scottish philosophy of common sense which proclaims an objective reality can be satisfac- torily established on scientific principles; and secondly and chiefly, that the doctrines of Holy Scripture, duly interpreted, can be made to rest on and be consistent with the self same principles. Causality is the test of science. With this end in view, God, sonship, the origin and removal of sin, the soul, freedom, causality, election and predes- tination, priesthood, and the Lord's Supper are discussed. A Primer of The Christian Religion. Based on the Teaching of Jesus, Its Founder and Living Lord, by GEORGE H. GILBERT. The Macmillan Co., New York, I902. pp. 76. This primer, we are told, and the whole Gospel is a primer, seeks only to turn the reader's thoughts to the great events and to the main features of the life and teachings of Jesus. It speaks the language of the school, and treats of Jesus, God, spirit, the kingdom of God, fol- lowing Jesus, the Bible Sunday and the hereafter. The whole is put in eighty-five questions printed in red, each with a concise answer, evidently for memorization, with a few proof texts and generally a note. The Menopause, by ANDREW F. CURRIER. D. Appleton and Co., New York, I897. pp. 309. Although this work is not exactly new, it is so excellent and com- pendious and so supersedes Tilt's well known book upon the same subject, that it deserves brief mention. Die Entwicklung der Religionsbegriffe als Grundlage einer progres- siven Religion, von STEFAN von CZOBEI. Lotus-Verlag, Leipzig, I901. This is the last half volume of a work briefly characterized in a former number of this Journal. This is devoted to morals, external cult and priesthood. Der Gesang der Vogel, seine anatomischen und biologischen Grund- lagen, von VALENTIN HAECKER. Gustav Fischer, Jena, I9oo. pp. Io2. In this interesting and important work, the writer treats first of the LITERATURE. 321</page><page sequence="4">LITERATUR.E structure of the vocal organs of birds. He then discusses at length sexual dimorphism. Most interesting, perhaps, is the third chapter on the development of the singing instinct in its various forms. He then treats other courtship phenomena-drumming, tumbling, play- ing, mock fighting, etc. Finally, he discusses the development and significance of the courting instinct and the relations between reflexes, instinct and play, and ends with a good nomenclature. Les Arts et Mdtiers chez les Animaux, par H. COUPIN. Nony &amp; Cie, Paris, 1902. pp. 422. This ingenious and industrious writer has collected from many sources accounts of the industries of animals, which he classifies as masons, potters, weavers, paper makers, cotton makers, mound build- ers, road and bridge makers, sewers, wax moulders, rosin makers, tapisers, miners, basket makers, wheel makers, confectioners, cigar makers, hammock makers, comb maKers, spinners, architects of houses of amusement, carpenters, hut builders, ditch makers, stone borers, etc. La Logique chez 1' Enfant et sa Culture, par FRED;RIC QUEYRAT. F. Alcan, Paris, I902. pp. I57. This naturally follows the two earlier works of the author on "Im- agination and its varieties in children " and "Abstraction and its r61e in education." First comes the logic of images with examples seen in their comparisons and the construction of phrases and propositions, personification and anthropomorphism. Analogical reasoning is thus the first type. Child sophisms are classified under induction (mainly those of insufficient data, errors concerning causes and sophisms of accidence) and deduction or a begging question, and ignorance of the subject and vicious circle. The chief faults of children might be characterized as due to credulity, candor, naYvete, folly, precipitation, prejudgment, irreflection, sentiment and imagination. The last chap- ter praises the importance of rational training. Der Selbstmord im kindlichen Lebensalter, von A. BAER. G. Thieme, Leipzig, I90I. pp. 84. A member of the council of public hygiene in Berlin here ably sums up the history of the statistics of suicide of youth in France, Italy, an(l especially Germany, and draws therefrom important lessons. He holds that the chief cause is not to be found in the school, although he would relieve it from over pressure and especially from the worry of examina- tions, to which some cases especially in the lower schools can be directly traced. The chief cause to him is precocity or the premature develop- ment of an adult sense of responsibility, altruism or knowledge, and finds it most frequent in the lowest and in the highest stages of society, or better among the poorest and the richest strata of society. Of twenty- five interesting cases, he has himself made a special study. It is ex- tremely desirable to have data on this subject collected with the same care for Anglo-Saxon races. The Four Temperaments in Children. Their Appearance and Treat- ment in Rearing and in the School. As Appendix: The Tempera- ment of Parents and Teachers. By BERNHARD HELLWIG. J. Esser, Paderborn. pp. 79. This is an interesting characterization of each of the four phrenologi- cal types of childhood-the sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic. The treatment proper to each type is considered, and there is an appendix on the temperament of parents and teachers. Whatever we may think of phrenology, this book is of much interest and value. 322</page></plain_text>
