The book limits itself to a five-million-year period of the Creta ceous, 87-82 million years ago, during which the limey mud that would eventually become the Smoky Hill Chalk was deposited. More than a century of paleontological work on the chalk provides the raw material for a paleoecological sketch of the seaway. Introductory chapters on the discovery of the Western Interior Sea and the Smoky Hill Chalk's stratigraphy and inverte brate, plant, and trace fossils provide context for Everhart's main focus: predator-prey and scavenging interactions, emphasizing marine reptiles and fish. Individual chapters are de voted to sharks, fishes, turtles, elasmosaurs (long necked, small-headed plesiosaurs), pliosaurs and polycotylids (short-necked, large-headed plesiosaurs), mosasaurs, pteranodons, and birds. Everhart also offers a short chapter on the rare dinosaur fossils that occur in the chalk. A final chapter provides a broad overview of this five million-year slice of Western Interior Seaway history. Oceans of Kansas offers insights and context of value both to paleontologists and neontologists, emphasizing the evolutionary possibilities once expressed by sharks, fishes, and reptiles. Many of the species described lack modern analogues, except in the broadest ecological sense. While a toothed whale is in some respects ecologically equivalent to a mosasaur of similar size, the mosasaur's example affords an opportunity to consider the diversity of life over geological time and the manner by which natural selection always acts similarly on vertebrate raw materials but necessarily does so with different results. While mosasaurs are ecologically analogous to toothed whales, for instance, they are anatomically very distinct. Elasmosaurs are also unique, both anatomically and ecologically. No other known marine vertebrates had necks equal to or greater than half their entire length and relied on the same methods of locomotion and predation. Everhart's book deals routinely with a host of novel species, all long extinct. To the extent that biology refines and systematizes the human fascination with life's variety, a work like Oceans of Kansas is liable to be of interest, and perhaps even inspiration, to a broad audience. It is one thing to know intuitively that past ecosystems and their key actors were as diverse and interesting as their modern equivalents; it is quite another thing?and a much more rewarding one at that?to have that intuition substantiated with details. The natural history Everhart offers is attractive partly because it is very much a work in progress. ICnowledge of the Western Interior Seaway's ecology remains limited. Complete specimens of many species are lacking, as are explanations for the numerous faunal changes that occurred over the five million years covered. In telling us what is known and suspected, Everhart also necessarily tells us what remains to be done. The risk in a study of this sort is that the author will be forced to offer a series of free standing species accounts, without the unifying benefit of ecological context. By focusing on a five-million year period with a relatively rich fossil record, Everhart avoids this pitfall. Although the taxon omy of fossil species is always subject to major revision, Everhart's attention to ecological detail insures that Oceans of Kansas will remain a valu able resource for the foreseeable future. Fortu nately, Everhart also takes pains to get the taxonomy right, paying close attention to what is known or suspected about the species he discusses, often by recounting detailed histories of their discovery and formal description. Eco logical reconstructions are similarly well grounded, often by fossil evidence of predation or scavenging (the two are difficult to distinguish in the fossil record). Everhart's familiarity with the literature and experience collecting and researching Smoky Hill Chalk specimens allows him to take an informed but balanced view of his subjects, and he takes care when offering opinions to point out where, how, and why they differ from other assessments of the same evidence. In an era of well-illustrated vertebrate paleobi ology books, the graphics in Oceans of Kansas more than hold their own. They also strike a necessary balance between being informative and inspiring wonder?which is arguably what the illustrations in every book-length study of vertebrate paleobiology intended for a broad audience should aspire to. Readers are presented with photographs of everyday-looking fossils that provide important paleoecological insights along with colorful reconstructions of large marine predators interacting, often aggressively. In keeping with the study's emphasis on historical context, numerous illustrations from nineteenth and early twentieth-century manuscripts are also reproduced. Black-and-white photographs are more typical, however, and are generally clear and relatively large, although there are excep tions (e.g., Figure 4.9). Russell Hawley's line drawings are generally well-crafted, aside from a few lapses (e.g., Figure 7.9), and Dan Varner's necessarily speculative paintings of fish and marine reptiles are typically dynamic and engag ing. Oceans of Kansas has some problems, but they tend to be more matters of presentation than</page><page sequence="3">500 COPEIA, 2007, NO. 2 substance. Among the book's weak points are the fictionalized accounts of predator-prey interac tions that open each chapter. In addition to giving some sense of what life might have been like for the various species discussed, these accounts offer one possible explanation for the condition and unique characteristics of the fossil specimens discussed. Unfortunately, these sec tions tend towards the rhetorical missteps of sensationalism and overly broad speculation that are more typical of (if not more forgivable in) popular science television programs. Readers sophisticated enough to appreciate Everhart's writing, which is generally very clear and not overly technical but certainly not simplistic, can be expected to do without anthropomorphic presentations of extinct vertebrates?or, worse, attempts at reconstructing their thoughts or perceptions. These narratives also tend toward unfounded speculation?which Everhart occa sionally admits immediately after presenting them. Here, the book gives readers less credit than it should. Moreover, Everhart's writing is more than up to the task of handling the same topics in straight nonfiction prose. Oceans of Kansas also occasionally bogs down in the details of species discovery and description, focusing on historical narratives at the expense of the natural history promised by the study's title. This is especially evident in the chapter on pteranodons, which offers an excessively detailed historical account of fossil discoveries before concluding with a disappointingly brief summa tion of current research. Whether or not the attention to historical detail is a weakness of the book depends on the reader. Those particularly interested in the history of Western Interior Seaway vertebrate paleontology will find a wealth of information. Those whose interests lean more toward evolution and paleoecology will also be rewarded, although not always so richly. That being said, Oceans of Kansas remains the best and only book of its type currently available. Ever hart's treatment of extinct marine reptiles synthesizes source materials far more readably than any other recent, nontechnical book-length study of the subject while ably incorporating fishes, sharks, birds, and pteranodons into the ecological picture. WTiile other authors bog down in reciting details, sometimes without the necessary expertise to assess conflicting claims about the species or ecosystems in question, Everhart is always headed somewhere, and the journey is informed by expertise. Regrettably, ichthyosaurs and giant pliosaurids were already extinct before the Smoky Hill chalk was de posited and so are not covered here. That's too bad. I suspect a great many readers?like me? would have enjoyed Everhart's take on them as well. Jeffrey V. Yule, School of Biological Sciences, P. 0.
