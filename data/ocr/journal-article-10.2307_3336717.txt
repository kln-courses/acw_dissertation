<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mangbetu Pottery: Tadition and Innovation in Northeast Zaire ENID SCHILDKROUT* JILL HELLMAN* CURTIS KEIM The figurative pottery of the Mangbetu of northeastern Zaire has been well known to scholars and collectors of Afri- can art since the beginning of the cen- tury It is one manifestation of the an- thropomorphic art long considered typi- cal of the Mangbetu, much of which is strikingly stylized in form, portraying the elongated head shape characteristic of these people at the turn of the century and, in many cases, the fan-like coiffure then fashionable among the women (Figs. 1,2). Like other types of Mangbetu anthropomorphic art, the pottery ap- pears to have been created during a rela- tively brief period that coincides with the onset of Belgian rule in northeastern Zaire. It is clear that this genre was based on preexisting aesthetic traditions found in many parts of the region, particularly among the northern neighbors of the Mangbetu. It flourished in its "classic" form from the end of the nineteenth cen- tury until the Second World War, and has now virtually disappeared. The brief efflorescence of figurative pottery can be analyzed from two perspectives: the first considers the con- text of artistic traditions in northeastern Zaire, including not only those of the Mangbetu but also those of neighboring peoples; the second considers the histor- ical context. There is a great deal of his- torical evidence to help us interpret the meaning of these pots. We must stress that while the famous anthropomorphic pieces are of the greatest significance from the point of view of the Western art collector and historian, they are in fact a sidelight to a more extensive ceramic tradition. Previously published work on the pot- tery has considered only the an- thropomorphic style attributed to the Mangbetu, but that genre should be con- sidered in a larger ethnographic con- text.1 Northeastern Zaire's varied envi- ronments and abundant natural re- sources have attracted a diversity of peoples. The Mangbetu-speaking peoples2 straddle the border zone be- tween forest and savanna, where popu- lation densities surpass those of neighboring areas and where peoples of three major linguistic groups - the Bantu, Central Sudanic (of which Man- gbetu is a part), and Ubangian - have shared certain linguistic, artistic, and other cultural traditions for centuries. Within what can be called the Mangbetu cultural area, subtle differences in art styles, embodied in the pottery, reflect contacts with adjacent peoples, in par- ticular the Azande3 and Barambo. The art known as Mangbetu is not the exclu- sive work of Mangbetu artists, but is rather an expression of the political and cultural preeminence of that group at the time it was created.

Most of the data for this paper derive from a study of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) Congo Expedi- tion accession (1915-29), which includes several thousand ethnographic objects collected in northeastern Zaire between 1909 and 1914. This collection is extraordinarily well documented, pro- viding us with an unusual abundance of evidence concerning the context of pro- duction of African art and artifacts in the early twentieth century. One year after the Belgians took over the administra- tion of the Congo Free State from King Leopold in 1908,4 Herbert Lang, a mam- malogist, and James P. Chapin, an or- nithologist, were sent to Zaire by the AMNH to collect and study the fauna of the northeastern region.5 The expedition was supposed to last for two years, but the two men stayed until 1915, returning with 54 tons of zoological and ethno- graphic specimens, 9,000 photographs, and extensive field notes. Although their sponsors might have been satisfied with a few fine examples for the new African 1.

Lang also became interested in the ethnography of the region and acquired almost 4,000 objects from the Mangbetu, Azande, Barambo, Logo, and neighbor- ing peoples.6 Although he was not a trained ethnographer, his field notes are excellent sources of descriptive informa- tion. Lang studied the pottery and even wrote an account of its manufacture. The Congo Expedition material in- cludes about 200 pots. The majority (about 120) are Mangbetu, which in- cludes the Meje, Makere, Matchaga, and Mangbele peoples. They were acquired largely in Niangara - in the northern Mangbetu region - and from around Medje, a post in the southern Mangbetu region.7 There are also pots (about 20 each) from the Azande and the Barambo, obtained mostly in Niangara and Poko, an administrative center on the border between the two peoples, and a few pots from other groups in the area, including the Mongelima and the Logo. Most of the examples in this collection are utilita- rian, including pots for cooking; for drinking water, wine, and beer; for stor- ing water or oil; and for carrying. About 20 are anthropomorphic. There were two other expeditions to northeastern Zaire during the same period. These were the German Central African Expedition (1907-8 and 1910-11) with Jan Czekanowski and Hermann Schubotz, and the Belgian Ethnographic Mission to the regions of the Uele and Ubangi rivers (1911-12) with Armand Hutereau. The latter resulted in a large collection, now in the Musee Royale de l'Afrique Centrale (MRAC) in Tervuren, Belgium, but there are no anthropomor- phic pots in it. Those held by the AMNH are therefore the earliest definitively dated examples of "Mangbetu" figura- tive pottery. Earlier travelers, beginning with John Petherick, Orazio Antinori, and Carlo Piaggia, who visited the coun- try of the "Niam-Niam," or Azande, in the mid-nineteenth century, provided descriptions of the local peoples and made small but significant collections (see Bassani 1978, Petherick 1861). There are nineteenth-century exam- ples of nonanthropomorphic pottery from the northeastern region as well as a number of early written accounts of pot- tery from the explorers Georg Schwein- furth (1874, 1875), Gaetano Casati (1895), Wilhelm Junker (1890, 1891, 1892), and others.8 The first Mangbetu pottery de- scribed is that illustrated in 1874 and 1875 (Fig. 3) by Schweinfurth, who had this comment:9 "Although they remain as unacquainted as other races with the use of the wheel, their productions, besides being of a superior quality, are of a more perfect symmetry than any which are elsewhere observed. All the vessels and drinking-cups of the Africans in general have the character of urns, being made without handles and being never other- wise than spherical in form; but those of the Monbuttoo exhibit a manifest im- provement, and by having the surface decorated either with some raised sym- metrical pattern (which is especially the case upon their oil vessels) or with some ornamental figures, they afford a firm hold to the hand, and thus make good the lack of handles for lifting them. It is, however, principally upon the water- bottles that the greatest care is bestowed, some of which may barely be said to rival in symmetry the far-famed examples of Egyptian art, and to betray a considera- ble faculty of plastic genius" (Schwein- furth 1874, vol. 2:116).10 Although these nineteenth-century observers admired the pottery of the re- gion, especially that of the Mangbetu, none ever described a figurative ceramic genre. Between 1879 and 1883 Junker made a collection destined for the Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg (Leningrad) and the Museum fir V61o- kerkunde in Berlin. Almost all the exam- ples arrived broken (1890, vol. 1:515), but at least one double-necked jar remains in the Leningrad collection. 11 While Junker, like Schweinfurth, makes no mention of anthropomorphic pottery, he did collect a wooden box (illustrated in 1890, vol. 2:191) with a carved head forming the handle. This Zande box is the earliest container with figurative carving that is known from the region. It is predated, however, by other examples of an- thropomorphic art. In the 1860s Carlo Piaggia and Orazio Antinori collected anthropomorphic terracotta pipes from the Bongo and Azande, which are now in the collections of the Museo Ar- cheologico Nazionale dell' Umbria in Perugia (Castelli 1984). Piaggia and Antinori, and the Englishman John Petherick, also collected ivory trumpets and wood harps with carved necks from the Azande, Bongo, and other groups to the north of the Mangbetu. Taken to- gether, this evidence suggests that an- thropomorphism, found in the art of the region in the nineteenth century, was in- troduced into Mangbetu pottery in the very early colonial era - between the beginning of the Congo Free State period (1891) and the early years of Belgian rule (from 1908). In the two decades between the arrival of King Leopold's troops in 1891 and the Belgian government's takeover of the Congo Free State in 1908, the European presence in northeastern Zaire grew. Niangara, on the northern edge of Man- gbetu territory bordering the Azande, became the most important center in the Upper Uele region. It was first a district headquarters, and later a zone (subdis- trict) headquarters. By 1894 construction had begun on brick houses for five Euro- peans, storehouses, a rest house, a pharmacy, a dining hall and stables, headquarters and a residence for an Af- rican police guard, and forty six-man barracks for African troops drawn from other parts of the Congo and elsewhere. In addition to the resident colonial ad- ministrators of the Congo Free State and four hundred soldiers from other parts of Africa, there were Europeans who traveled through Niangara in transit to and from their posts farther to the east. 3.

THIS DOUBLE-HEADED POT REFLECTS THE ARTISTS' FONDNESS FOR MAKING REPETITIVE IMAGES OF THE CLASSIC MANGBETU HEAD IN POTTERY WOOD, AND IVORY COLLECTED BY LANG IN NIANGARA, 1913. 24cm. By 1908 at least eight Europeans resided there. When one adds those who lived in the region or had occasion to go through the area - including administrators, soldiers, technicians, inspectors, mis- sionaries, itinerant European ivory trad- ers, and a few travelers - the total number of Europeans who had been in the town comes to perhaps a hundred. Thus Niangara was not wholly a Man- gbetu town, but rather a cosmopolitan center. Without doubt this cosmopolitan presence created a new market for locally made goods. Evidence from Lang and other early collectors shows that kings and chiefs12 patronized the arts and employed artists to make objects that were presented as gifts to visitors. The strong possibility exists that some types of objects that were especially admired by Europeans were commissioned for or even by them. For example, in the last year of Lang's stay (1914), Chief Okondo commissioned ivory carvings for him. Lang's earliest (1910) ethnographic col- lection made in southern Mangbetu ter- ritory, around the government post of Medje, contains no anthropomorphic pottery and only one anthropomorphic carving, a knife.'13But the material he ob- tained through his contacts with Belgian administrators resident in the towns of Niangara, Rungu, and Poko included numerous figurative carvings in wood and ivory that seem to have been made by the same hand. Anthropomorphic pottery was first collected in cosmopoli- tan Niangara and in Okondo's village just forty kilometers south, both places where a foreign audience, however small, had some influence by 1910. While foreigners may well have en- couraged the production of an- thropomorphic art, we also know that it was made for local use. Lang's field notes confirm again and again that in his time many of the figurative pieces were created to demonstrate wealth and status. All important men wore beauti- fully worked knives, many with carving on the handles, that were both utilitarian items and prestigious ornaments. Some of the very naturalistic figure carvings in wood were made for important men who kept them in their houses "for amusement." In Lang's only reference to anthropomorphic pottery being used, he says that "distinguished men" liked to carry them around when they were 41</page><page sequence="5">traveling. There was a constant need for new prestige objects, particularly those, like knives, that could be worn. The nature of kingship among the Mangbetu also encouraged the produc- tion of art. Lang was told by Queen Nen- zima, Okondo's senior wife, and others that upon the death of a king, almost all of his precious objects, as well as some of his wives, were destroyed or buried with him. Each ruler built a new headquarters and commissioned new prestige items and regalia, always incorporating tradi- tional symbols of power associated with leadership - like leopard skins, red tail- feathers from the grey parrot, ornate knives, and the iron double gong. Kingship involved a glorification of the personality of the individual leader: there was little in the way of regalia, and virtually no "art," that belonged to the office itself. It is important to appreciate the tenuous nature of centralized power in this region, to understand the impor- tance of an ever changing array of pres- tige items used as symbols of authority. 5.

Despite Schweinfurth's glorious de- scription of King Mbunza's14 court, few of its material artifacts have endured. What made Mbunza powerful and what impressed Schweinfurth the most were the enormous numbers of people sur- rounding the king, many of them wives. Their presence and comportment, more than material objects, demonstrated his power. The Mangbetu kingdoms, never very secure in their hold over outlying ter- ritories, were greatly divided by the time the agents of King Leopold II entered the area. Pressure from the Azande to the north, the ravages of the slave trade, and inherent weaknesses in the political system had fractured the tenuous cen- tralization evident in Schweinfurth's time. The rulers at the beginning of this century were attempting to bolster their uncertain power, and although many re- sisted the incursions of European admin- istrative rule and military power, others sought to curry favor where they could. This jockeying for power occurred while the Belgians were tightening their grip on the region and precisely when the great early collections of Mangbetu art were being formed. Lang specifically states that chiefs often presented an- thropomorphic pots as gifts to passing officers to maintain their reputations as men of importance. When Mangbetu rulers commissioned artists to make prestige objects for their own use and for presentation as gifts, they selected professional blacksmiths and carvers who were not necessarily from their own group. There are indica- tions that by Lang's time, some of them employed Zande artists, particularly around Niangara. These men worked in several media. In addition to forging the elaborate iron blades for show knives, blacksmiths carved the knife handles in wood and ivory. Harps, not originally Mangbetu instruments, and never part of the important court orchestras, were embellished with similarly carved heads and sometimes full figures.'5 Careful examination of the anthropomorphic art reveals that the same hand often worked in a variety of media, and that almost identical images adorned different kinds of objects. Were the earliest anthropomorphic pots usually made by Mangbetu, or were they made by Azande or another people? All of the earliest examples in the AMNH collection, those in the "classic" black- ened Mangbetu style, come from the cosmopolitan center of Niangara or from Okondo's village a short distance away Okondo himself, although a Mangbetu ruler, was of Matchaga origin, and like other chiefs, employed artists from other areas. Lang specifically refers to one male potter as Mangbetu, but some other artists who created typically "Man- gbetu" images were said to be from dif- ferent groups. Many of the an- thropomorphic sculptures in pottery, iv- ory, and wood that have been identified as Mangbetu were made by Azande, Barambo, Budu, or others. They were, in fact, portraits of the Mangbetu in which the characteristic head shape and hairstyle were naturalistically rendered. References to portraiture in Mangbetu art date from the time of Schweinfurth, who illustrates a harp with a head that he says represents King Mbunza.16 Lang made such references frequently, and twenty-five years later Schebesta wrote of the Budu: "They have attained a defi- nite progress in plastic art. Their favorite models for clay casts [pots?] and engrav- ings are the elongated heads of the Man- gbetu which they reproduce with as- tounding realism" (1936:111).17 The fact that many of the artists in the Mangbetu courts were Azande or Barambo from areas to the north bears on the question of the gender of the pot- ters. Among the Mangbetu, utilitarian pottery was, and still is, made by women. Figurative pottery, however, was the work of men. Lang, Schubotz (1913:54), and others make this point. Lang notes that men make all "artistic" pottery (1915), an ambiguous statement that may refer to some of the elaborately shaped nonanthropomorphic vessels as well as to the figurative pots. Among the Azande, however, all of the evidence in- dicates that even the most utilitarian pots were sometimes produced by men.18 Whether some of the Mangbetu an- thropomorphic examples were the work of male Zande potters, or whether Man- gbetu artists at some point adopted clay in addition to metal, wood, or ivory, is not totally clear. Both situations probably occurred. A series of photographs by H. Goldstein in 1949 in Medje raises yet another possibility. The photographs show a Mangbetu woman making an or- 42</page><page sequence="6">dinary coiled pot. When she reached its neck, a man took over and sculpted a head.19 These pictures were taken, how- ever, at a time when production of this kind of pottery was declining. In our study of the AMNH collection, supplemented by data gathered from other sources, we noticed that all of the anthropomorphic pottery that Lang and subsequent museum cataloguers iden- tified as Mangbetu falls into two style categories that correspond to geographic areas. A third style developed later among Azande in the Sudan. "Preclas- sic" northern Mangbetu pots, even those that do not incorporate the human image (Fig. 8), present a complexity of form and design that was transformed, in the early part of this century, into the most well- known Mangbetu anthropomorphic style (Fig. 1). In that style, the base of the vessel is round and the neck forms a 8. THREE-CHAMBERED MANGBETU WATER JAR FROM NIANGARA.

The southern Mangbetu area developed its own distinct anthropomorphic pottery but at a slightly later date (Fig. 5). The surface of these vessels was rubbed with red camwood powder, and the facial fea- tures are more abstract. The Zande pot- tery dating from the 1930s consists of beautiful water jars and imaginative dishes with repetitive use of the an- thropomorphic motif. Pots are made in human form or have numerous heads or whole figures embellishing their bodies (Fig. 7). The variations within each of these three very different styles are so slight that we suspect that very few pot- ters worked in each style. Regional variations are not always clearcut when we look at the nonan- thropomorphic pottery, partly because of extensive trade throughout the re- gion. Examples from the southern Man- gbetu region, collected largely from Medje, tend to be utilitarian and of simple form. Most of the pots have quite beautiful and subtle surface decoration. Some of the oil containers are covered with basketry, an addition that is both utilitarian (allowing one a firm grip on the pot) and aesthetic (Fig. 12). Lang purchased a number of pots in Medje that had highly burnished sur- faces. According to his written analysis of the pots he collected, these were from areas to the north and had been traded into Medje (Fig. 9). They strongly re- sembled Barambo ware (Fig. 10) in their glossy surface decoration.20 The surfaces of Barambo, Zande, and northern Man- gbetu utilitarian pots are similar in sev- eral ways: they are black, smooth and sometimes highly polished; they display incisions that include areas of small dots, made with a roulette, which often ap- pear within a deeply grooved outline, made with the fingers; the circular pat- 7.

While the Meje can be called Mangbetu in terms of language and culture, only the northern Meje had kingdoms. The southern Meje did not, and the formally complex prestige pottery was absent among them, as it was among the forest peoples to the south. In contrast to the southern examples, the nonanthropomorphic pottery col- lected from the north, largely from the towns of Niangara and Poko, is more elaborate, innovative, and varied in shape as well as in surface decoration (Fig. 17). Spheres of varying sizes joined vertically or horizontally produce un- usual formal combinations (Fig. 8). Handles were often added (Fig. 13); prot- ruding elements such as spikes appear around the neck or over the entire base (Fig. 16). Each pot is formed by a unique combination of elements. It was this northern interest in sculptural elabora- tion that probably led to the develop- ment of anthropomorphic pottery. The potters from Niangara subsequently created not only the classic jar with heads, but the imaginative vessels with double heads and full figures embracing a pot. Mangbetu kingdoms have existed in the northern region since at least the be- ginning of the nineteenth century, and the use of complex and innovative pot- tery in the royal courts is evident in the earliest documentation from this area. An example of a prestige vessel in use first appears in a drawing of King Mbunza made by Schweinfurth in the 1870s. It also shows an elaborate two- chambered water bottle resting on a stool to the ruler's right (Fig. 14). Lang's photograph of Okondo, taken in 1910, displays a similarly embellished water jar (Fig. 15). These images suggest that rulers stimulated the production of lux- ury pottery for upper-class consumption and exchange. Objects in these upper- class styles then caught on among sub- jects and neighboring peoples, and be- came appropriate objects for prestigious gifts. While neither of the pots shown with Mbunza or Okondo incorporated the human figure, the emphasis on elab- oration and innovation paved the way for the emergence of anthropomorphic pottery in the north. The figurative pottery that developed in and around Niangara, much of it in Okondo's village, is in what has become known as the typical Mangbetu style (Fig. 1). Although in many cases the provenance is unknown, these pots often bear such strong resemblance to those collected by Lang that we can as- sume they too were made in Okondo's village, or in Niangara, and perhaps by the same potter. The style is naturalistic, depicting the typical elongation of the head. The opening of the pot, at the top, is formed by the Mangbetu woman's coiffure. Facial features are full and sen- sual, and the head rests on a slender neck and rounded base. In their elegance and their air of grace and nobility, these pots conform to the image of the Man- gbetu as described by Europeans as far back as the 1870s, when Schweinfurth wrote about them. The distinctive style of adornment was copied by many non-Mangbetu peoples, like the neighboring Budu and the Makere, and enshrined in their art. Among the pottery Lang collected in Medje in 1910 is one type that is clearly distinctive, and which seems to be the form that became the basis for the an- thropomorphic pots collected in Medje four years later. These are the water jars, which are graceful, elegant, and subtly decorated (Fig. 11). A common surface motif is a pattern of half-circles made up of a combination of horizontal and verti- cal lines. The forms of the pots are fairly constant: a rounded base, a tall cylindri- cal neck, and no handles. It was not until Lang returned to Medje in 1914, four years after his first major collecting visit there, that he ac- quired anthropomorphic pots in the area. Even then he collected only three examples. The pots repeat the pattern of half-circle incisions found on water jars, which they also resemble in form and material (Fig. 5). That Lang found these objects only during his second visit suggests that the figurative style in pot- tery was developing and spreading to the more remote regions during the time that he was in the Congo. However, in an interesting note, he mentions that the pots with the half-circle design, though collected in Medje, had been gifts originating from north of the town. Whether this design and the idea of an- thropomorphism entered the area at the same time is difficult to say, but it is clearly possible that this whole series of water jars and the three anthropomor- phic pots that resemble them were made by the same potter, probably in a village to the north. The difference between the Niangara and the Meje figurative pots is striking. What we have called the Meje style of an- thropomorphic pottery has a solid and distinct presence, but it only faintly re- sembles the highly esteemed classic type. Whereas much Mangbetu an- thropomorphic art, including many of the Niangara pots, seem to be realistic likenesses of the women, the Meje pieces are more abstract, with flatter faces and less clearly defined features. They are not blackened, and hence do not have the high luster found on many Niangara pots. Lang believed that the three exam- ples were crude imitations of the Nian- gara models. However, this judgment undoubtedly stems from his notion - typical for his time - that a higher de- gree of realism in art, and a more polished surface, reflected a higher de- gree of civilization. After the First World War, production of anthropomorphic pottery decreased. 44</page><page sequence="8">11. INCISED MEJE WATER JAR. COLLECTED BY LANG IN MEDJE, 1910. 25cm. 12.

In the 1920s Carl and Delia Akeley col- lected Mangbetu-style figurative pots (now in the Brooklyn Museum and the Newark Museum) that are reminiscent of those made for Okondo. The French Citroen Mission (1924-25) collected at least three examples (now in the Mushe des Arts Africains et Oceaniens), and the Dakar-Djibouti expedition in the early 1930s collected several more. In the late 1930s, Martin Birnbaum visited the Mangbetu in search of art, but he found no anthropomorphic pottery (Birnbaum 1939, 1942). He was not, however, in the northern region around Niangara. By the 1940s a few figurative pieces were still being made in Ndingba, near Okondo's former capital. According to Lelong, a Belgian missionary working there at the time, pottery from the area was of a most ordinary type, in no way comparable to that described in the nineteenth century (Lelong 1946, vol. 1:215). Goldstein's 1949 photographic se- quence of pottery-making in Medje, as well as written accounts, such as that from Lelong, suggest that men were not seriously involved in its production. As in earlier times, women were making or- dinary ceramic vessels for domestic use. Goldstein photographed a woman pot- ter making a coiled round pot, but she called upon a man to sculpt a head for the piece in progress. The head was of poor 13.

While an atelier of stool-makers existed in 1949, pottery-making seems not to have developed in this way Moreover, the mission School of Arts and Trades es- tablished in the Mangbetu town of Rungu never produced ceramic items. In the 1930s very fine anthropomor- phic pottery was made in an atelier at the Sleeping Sickness Station at Lirangu in the Azande area of the Sudan. Most of the examples, which include large water jars, bowls, and dishes adorned with sculpted heads, were made by one man, Mbitim. When he began working at the Sleeping Sickness Station he was en- couraged to make ceramic bookends and other objects of European design. Exam- ples of this pottery were collected on the Powell-Cotton expedition of 1932-33, and are now in the British Museum in London, the Pitt-Rivers Museum in Ox- ford, the Powell-Cotton Museum in East Kent, and in private collections (RAI: Proceedings, 1934). The AMNH has one example by Mbitim, received in 1963 as a gift from the Department of Antiquities in Sudan (Fig. 7). The Zande examples from Lirangu seem to have grown out of an older tradi- tion of anthropomorphic pottery found among the Adio Azande, also known as the Makaraka. John Mack has pointed out that Lirangu is on the frontier of Makaraka territory and that Makaraka pottery is stylistically related to a ceramic tradition that developed much earlier among the neighboring Belanda and 14.

Bongo peoples.22 In the 1920s Seligman observed that the Makaraka "excel other Sudan tribes in plastic ability, the human heads modelled on the mouths of their flask-shaped water jars being not un- worthy of West Africa" (Seligman &amp; Seligman 1932).23 Makaraka, Belanda, and Bongo anthropomorphic ceramics can be traced back to the nineteenth cen- tury: examples of figurative terracotta pipes from this area, collected in the 1860s and 1880s, are illustrated in works by Junker (1892, vol. 3:287) and Castelli (1984:68). The more we study Mangbetu and Zande anthropomorphic pottery, and the documentation available on it, the stronger is our suspicion that its disap- pearance is related to the possibility that very few potters made all of the known examples. Most of those in European col- lections seem to have been made by men within one or perhaps at most two gen- erations. Among the Mangbetu, at least, potters were traditionally women, and men entered into this activity for only a brief period. Lang explicitly noted that there were only a few men making pot- tery, each with his own distinct and rec- ognizable style. All were proficient in some other art form, being well known as carvers and blacksmiths, and were connected to certain chiefs. Lang ob- served that several pots were the work of the same man;24 in addition, there are anthropomorphic and nonan- thropomorphic jars from Niangara that have the same shape and body decora- tion and were clearly made by the same artist.25 Why is it that anthropomorphic pot- tery never became more than an episodic sidelight to a more extensive ceramic tradition in northeastern Zaire? Why did these artists not teach others, particu- larly if an outside audience existed for their products? Among the Mangbetu, women are still making utilitarian pots of a fairly ordinary type. Although manu- factured goods have replaced many tra- ditional items, men continue to work in iron and wood, concentrating on musical instruments and other utilitarian objects of the kind that predated the efflores- cence of figurative carving. The fact that anthropomorphic pots and harps were never well integrated into the daily lives of ordinary people partly explains their disappearance. The former were impractical as containers, could not be used for cooking, and in some cases would have been difficult to use at all, except perhaps if one drank from them with a straw (Figs. 4,6). (Straws were in fact used.) They may have been used as drinking vessels for a brief time, but only by important men as symbols of status. Furthermore, neither the harps nor the anthropomorphic pot- tery ever had any ritual meaning, despite Westerners' frequent assumption to the contrary. 15.

MANGBETU WATER JARS DISPLAYED ELABORATE AND IMAGINATIVE FORMS LONG BEFORE HUMAN IMAGES WERE INCORPORATED INTO CERAMIC ART COLLECTED BY LANG IN NIANGARA, 1910. 28.5cm. During the period when there was an audience for this pottery, it developed into an art form much appreciated by powerful individuals within the society and by outsiders who collected it. The European presence may have provided at least some of the impetus for the in- troduction of the human figure into Mangbetu ceramic traditions at the be- ginning of the colonial period; neverthe- less it was obviously insufficient to main- tain this innovation, despite the increase in the number of Europeans in the area and the pottery's growth in value among collectors over at least the last few de- cades. Indeed, most of the trade among collectors seems to involve the recircula- tion of pieces collected before the Second World War. While the great majority of these pots have ended up in non-African hands, outsiders were not in fact the main patrons of the potters. Historical and contextual evidence shows that the Mangbetu made an- thropomorphic pots as prestige items for powerful insiders and some selected outsiders, but they never really pro- duced them for commercial purposes, at least not on any large scale. For a short period, a few artists who normally worked in other media turned to clay. Chiefs, the primary patrons of the arts among the Mangbetu, solicited figura- tive pots for themselves and for others as gifts. However, no market for these goods ever evolved within Mangbetu so- ciety, and no significant commerce ob- tained between the artists and outside purchasers. Okondo, probably the most important patron of the anthropomor- phic pots, died in 1915. By the 1920s the colonial system had become so bureau- 17. ZANDE POT.

Unlike many figurative ceramic genres from other parts of Africa, which are usually understood to be expressions of the spiritual concerns of their creators, that of the Mangbetu was entirely secu- lar. Nevertheless, despite its appeal to outsiders, it cannot be seen as tourist art. The anthropomorphic pots were an in- novation built upon a longstanding tra- dition of decorated utilitarian pottery, to some extent drawn from neighboring peoples, which briefly became impor- tant to the Mangbetu for essentially polit- ical reasons.

We are grateful to the curators who made their collections accessible to us for this research, most especially Madame Huguette Van Geluwe of the Mus6e Royal del'Afrique Centrale, John Mackof the British Museum, and Derek Howlett of the Powell-Cotton Museum. John Mack also offered valuable information regarding Zande pottery traditions. 1. See Claire Kuennen (1983) for a study of Mangbetu an- thropomorphic pottery based on published examples. 2. Mangbetu is a Central Sudanic language, but the Mangbetu cultural area includes peoples of diverse origins. The Mangbetu kingdoms of the nineteenth century also incorporated non- Mangbetu peoples. 3. Azande is the noun form, while Zande is the adjectival form. 4. King Leopold II personally ruled the Congo Free State until 1908, when the government of Belgium took over the ad- ministration of the colony. From 1908 until the end of Belgian rule it was known as the Belgian Congo or simply the Congo. 5. In 1902 a major large mammal discovery had been made in Africa-that of the elusive okapi, the sole remaining relative of the giraffe. The AMNH and other natural history museums (including the MRAC) were interested in obtaining study and exhibition specimens of the okapi, the white rhinoceros, and other African fauna. 6. The AMNH will open an exhibition of this material in May 1990. "African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire" will travel to a number of other venues, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services. The par- ticipating institutions have not been identified as of the writing of this paper. 7. Medje is the spelling of the colonial post/town, while Meje is the modern spelling used for the people. 8. Some of the references to examples of nineteenth-century pottery are found in Schweinfurth (1874, vol. 1: 292; 1875, Tab. XIV, Tab. XV, Tab. XVI); Junker (1891: 285); Casati (1895: 90); Van Overbergh and de Jonghe (1909: 261-64). Examples are rare but can be found in the Ethnographic Museum in Leningrad and the Museum fiir Vl61kerkunde, Vienna. 9. It is curious that this pot is diminutive in Schweinfurth's drawing of King Munza, although in his description and il- lustration of it (fig. 2), it appears to be of the usual size-30-35 centimeters. 10. Schweinfurth further noted that the Mangbetu differed from their neighbors (e.g., the Azande) in that they did not use pottery pipes, but rather employed the midrib of the plantain leaf to smoke "Virginian tobacco" (1874, vol. 2: 117). 11. The museum is officially known as the State Ethnographical Museum of the Peoples of the USSR. This pot is illustrated in Junker's account (1890, vol.2:285) and is described as a drink- ing vessel for beer. 12. The literature switches between the terms "king" and "chief" although the Mangbetu term nekenyi applies to both. After King Munza, of Schweinfurth fame, died in the 1870's, powerful men and potential heirs (succession followed the male line) fought for power and carved up what remained of the short-lived centralized state of earlier days. 13. This knife, perhaps the finest carving in the AMNH collec- tion, is a well-worn example that clearly was made for local use. 14. Schweinfurth wrote "Munza," but the Mangbetu say "Mbunza." 15. They have completely disappeared, and today Mangbetu do not know how to play them. They used to be played for in- dividual entertainment. See the forthcoming AMNH exhibition catalogue for a fuller discussion of Mangbetu music by Didier Demolin. 16. The published drawing of this harp (Schweinfurth 1875) identifies it simply as Azande, but the unpublished drawing of the same piece, in the collection of the Frobenius-Institut in Frankfurt, notes the identity of the image. 17. It should be noted that the northern Budu were in close con- tact with the Mangbetu, and that some were ruled by Mangbetu chiefs. The Budu and others in the region are also known to have adopted the Mangbetu custom of elongating the head, which makes it still more difficult to determine who was being portrayed in this typically Mangbetu image. 18. Larken, writing in the 1920s, says that "waterpots are of the conventional type, and many people of both sexes know how to make them" (1927:129 ff.). During the 1930s, when Evans- Pritchard did fieldwork among the Avungara Azande in the Sudan, men made most of the pottery, even the most utilitarian forms. Evans-Pritchard actually apprenticed himself toa male potter and studied the craft in some detail. 19. These photographs are in the collection of the MRAC (cat. nos. EPH 14114-14125). 20. Before the mid-nineteenth century, many northern peoples-Azande, Bangba, Barambo, and others-were in- corporated by the Mangbetu. However, fortunes reversed in the last third of the century, when most northern Mangbetu territories were actually taken over by people from the north- the Bangba-Matchaga and the Azande-Avungara. In Lang's time the Mangbetu kingdom around Niangara was ruled by the Bangba-Matchaga and the Zande kingdom around Poko in- cluded subjects who had at one time been in the orbit of the Mangbetu. 21. C.G. Seligman, who spent time with the Azande of Southern Sudan and other peoples to their north in 1920-21, makes a reference to the pottery technique of the Mbegumba, a Belanda-related group who lived northwestof the Bongoand the Azande. He says women made the pots and that "before firing the pots are coated with a slip of the special kind of black mud called liki in Zande; the finished pot has a high polish, presumably obtained by burnishing before firing" (1932: 481). He provides no pictures, unfortunately, but from the descrip- tion there seems clearly a relation between the burnished pot- tery surface of this area and that of the northern Mangbetu and Zande pottery. 22. This will be described in further detail in John Mack's con- tribution to the forthcoming catalogue of the AMNH exhibition, "African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire." 23. This was based partly on information from Evans-Pritchard, who worked in the area in the 1920s. 24. Such as AMNH nos. 90.1/4658 and 90.1/4704, and 90.1/4678 and 90.1/4657. 25. For example, 90.1/4683 and 90.1/4692. 26. The ways chiefs cooperated with colonial officials chang- ed over the years but included collecting rubber and taxes, pro- viding labor, and enforcing various laws.
