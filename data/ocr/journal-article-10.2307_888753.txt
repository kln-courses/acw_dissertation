The exhibition is much stronger in its representation of the next, and arguably most important phase of Pissarro's career, including the time spent in London during the Franco-Prussian war, the works done immediately after his return, and the beginnings of'Impressionism'. The beauti- ful Chestnut trees in Louveciennes, Spring (no.8; Stiftung Langmatt Sidney andJenny Brown, Baden) of 1870 shows Pissarro's ability to handle complicated pattern effects - the trees and their long shadows - as he was to do so well in many of his most ambitious paintings later in the decade. In London, he painted the view from Sydenham Hill to- wards Lower Norwood, a painting now in the Kimbell (Fig.68), given to his wifeJulie as a wedding present, and distinguishable from the French landscapes of this date by its more vivid greens, and by its inclusion of the distinctive red-brick architecture of South London. Pissarro's return to France is marked by a fine group of paintings: the Staatsgalerie's own Seine at Port-Marly, domi- nated by the chimney-stacks of the barges (no. 18), and two paintings of a factory at Pontoise, producing sugar from sugarbeet, one loaned from Jerusalem (no.19), the other from Williamstown (no.20). All three pictures show Pissarro's easy accept- ance of industrialisation and his interest in the conjunction of smoke and steam with cloud and weather effects. The climbing path, L'Hermitage, Pontoise (Fig.69) of 1875 shows Pissarro spatially at his most accomplished, taking further the spatial effects of the Metropolitan's painting eight years earlier, leading the eye up the path and to the right, down to the trees and river, across to the houses on the far bank; he applies paint boldly, at least in part, with a palette knife. Two years later, this spatial sophistication is evident in the Rubens-like Rainbow, Pontoise (no.34; Kroller-Muller Museum, Otterlo) with its panoramic gaze over the landscape, and its sense of changing viewpoints, from the artist's feet, at the centre of the painting, to peripheral vision of the outer reaches of the vista. What happens then? It is a cliche of impressionist studies to talk of the 'crisis of Impressionism' but this really does seem to occur with Pissarro. The confidence of touch and handling of space which marks the best of the earlier paintings seems to desert him, long before he becomes a convert to Seurat's pointillism, and the paintings are awkward and stilted, like the Resting, peasant girl lying on the grass, Pontoise (no.41; Kunsthalle, Bremen) with its oddly twisted body. Despite his often-avowed con- tempt for the symbolic, all Pissarro's paint- ings of peasants are redolent of a rather obvious symbolism, an attempt to convey peasant life as idyllic, unchanging, and above all, 'good' in a moral and political sense. The city paintings of the 1890s were intended to be seen as a counterpoint to this obsession with the rural and the exhibition includes a selection of images from Paris, Rouen and Dieppe which served well to make this point, and to underscore Pissarro's decision to return to city subjects at a time when his impressionist colleagues had large- ly abandoned them. In the second part of the exhibition, the juxtaposition of Pissarro's works with paint- ings by his contemporaries enabled some interesting observations to be made. Pissar- ro's atmospheric June morning, view over the hills of Pontoise (no.16; Karlsruhe) of 1873, is placed between Monet's 1873 Summer and his Houses in Argenteuil (both from the Nationalgalerie, Berlin), and the similarities in tonality and palette are striking. Pissarro's use of the path as a recessional device, with some staffage figures in the middle distance, appears more conventional than Monet's tendency to organise the canvas as a series of horizontal bands, but both artists convey a sense of a particular summer day and use varied brushstrokes to convey textures in comparable ways. The Pissarro/Cezanne juxtapositions also heighten in a way sel- dom achieved in museums the idea of a shared philosophy and mutual interrelated practice. This thought-provoking, intelligent exhi- bition succeeds in being more than yet another retrospective of an impressionist painter. It brings together not only the var- ied strands of Pissarro's own work, includ- ing his book designs done in collaboration with his eldest son Lucien, but also draws out comparisons and differences between Pissarro and his colleagues in a way seldom attempted under the rubric of a mono- graphic exhibition.

New York New abstraction For a period roughly corresponding to the third quarter of the twentieth century, abstraction seemed fixated on innovation, on novelty. Decades earlier the inaugu- ration of abstraction per se had been accom- panied by the rhetoric of vanguardism and breakthrough; its continuity seemed to require the sustaining of that pioneer status. By piercing the surface, introducing kinesis, exploiting optical effects, recruiting emotive 'process' (burning, firing guns, riding bicy- cles over the support), or rational 'system', artists sought to make abstraction always new. Minimalists were the most dedicated followers of fashion - one season in polka dots, the next in stripes. The monochrome saw repeated incarnations, in a paradox- ical, infinitely renewed finity, while critics applauded as they might a tragedian expir- ing on stage. Painting could be rapturously implored: die again! die again! By the 1970s, however, novelty for its own sake, combined with reductivism, was widely seen as a fatal avant-garde fallacy. Alongside a widespread return to figuration around the 1980s, abstraction took to re- cycling its past styles ironically, most obvi- ously in Neo-Geo, which parodied the very notion of an idealistically vanguard mod- ernism. Since then the pastiche aesthetic has become so much par for the abstract course that young painters are able to proffer, often quite unconsciously, pictorial moves utterly familiar from the 1950s or 1960s, and these are readily assimilated into a contemporary climate of eclecticism. So much is this the case that earlier quests for novelty, however facile their results, now seem almost desirable again. In retrospect they can be seen to have in fact signalled a strong sense of tradition - of a body of achievement, in relation to which new work had to define itself. The current stylistic free-fall, by contrast, often reflects an amne- siac, dehistoricised sense of painting. Several recent exhibitions in New York demonstrated the ways in which abstract painting could relate to its past either passively, through a default genericism, or more purposefully, in an attempt once again to innovate but with something more, now, than superficial trend-making or trend- breaking motives. The paintings of Cecily Brown have been until recently quite explicitly figura- tive, depicting bodies in sexual, even porno- graphic interaction. However, in her recent exhibition at Gagosian (closed 19th Febru- ary) the huge canvases appeared for the most part entirely abstract (Fig.70). Only in one did an inverted face clearly loom out of the morass of expressionist slurps, scrapes and slippery trails of predominantly red, pink white and grey paint. Elsewhere the bodily and erotic was only insinuated (as in work by another painter of her generation, Sue Williams, with whom she has indeed been compared). Brown is already suffering a critical backlash from her swift rise to prestige via an exhibition at Deitch Projects last year to this (quite similar) showcase at Gagosian's downtown powerhouse. Com- mentators have been quick this time to point out her dependence on abstract expression- ism, often of a second-generation manner. Equally notable, however, is the European flavour of the work, reminiscent of 1950s Ecole de Paris stars such as Paul Rebeyrolle. As observed by those familiar with the Lon- don scene, Brown's mix is also curiously reminiscent of that which brought attention to another London painter, Therese Oulton, some years ago. It is a manner at once invit- ing of fantasy and psychological interpre- tation, yet also grandly decorative and redolent of high museum art. The young Spanish painter Santi Moix showing at Paul Kasmin's new Chelsea space displayed a more immediately indi- vidual vision. His exhibition (closed 11th March) showed a development away from the Gustonesque clusters of organic forms that he favoured two years ago. Now his odd impasted baubles, pendules, crustacea and coral-like protuberances are strung along horizon lines crossing sky-blue fields of loose brushmarks (Fig. 71). The structure is associative of landscape, specifically of mountainous terrain reflected in water. Again there is a 1950s flavour to the work, but specific precedents are harder to identify 257</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS works' ambition, authenticity, and laudable willingness to risk failure. Thus one quickly began to identify the more open, sensitive painterly performances (as in the smallest canvas of the show) from those (such as the largest) that seemed formulaic and somehow 'hard'. These kinds of distinctions become possible partly through the work's repetition, with variation, of a certain pictor- ial pattern and formula, and here we come up against a difficult issue. One of the com- monly depressing features of contempor- ary one-person painting exhibitions is their tendency to offer a neat 'product range' of instantly recognisable signature items, in a variety of sizes and formulations, but all reliably within one style and structure. Such was the prevailing feel of Cecily Brown's show, certainly, and something of the same 'sameyness' characterised the Moix exhibi- tion. What distinguishes the necessary and respectable consistency of a serious research project, and the development of a personal idiom, from the production of tediously familiar production units? Thomas Nozkowski at Max Protetch (closed 1 8th March) offered one convincing answer, in paintings which were intensely consistent, yet never repetitive or formulaic. There is a rock-solid reliability in the artist's format (he has almost always painted on just two sizes, 16 by 20 and 22 by 28 inches), and in his unmistakable vocabulary of built-up and scraped-down layers of paint, generat- ing luminous, faintly haloed ovoids, poly- gons, looping lines, and eccentric shards that can appear like die-cut fragments from garment patterns. Yet Nozkowski's works, while instantly recognisable, are very hard to typify. One may have a play of Persian arabesques, another a Purist architecture (Fig. 73). Another will offer a biological asso- ciation of cells on a microscope slide; yet another will have a sense of geography gen- erated partly from a map or aerial view feel, partly from suggesting cross-sections through soil strata, partly from evoking the temp- erature and atmosphere of an outdoor 70.

Gagosian Gallery, New York). than in Brown, and there is a more interest- ing, genuinely odd recasting of the familiar forms of decorative, slightly psychedelic, slightly 'tie-dye', popular abstraction. There is a real feeling of a painterly intelligence, or at least instinct, in the work. Moix's affin- ity with once-discredited abstract modes seems as conscious as that of the American painter Terry Winters,l but without trading on perverse style moves for their own sake, and without settling for familiar spatial structures or tastefully tokenist materiality. In particular what is impressive is the gen- uinely sensual use of paint and colour, with creamy browns and earth reds in complex harmonies, worked with a variety of touch and stroke, against the prevailing comple- mentary of cerulean blue. Moix's pictorial compound is complex enough, and his personal handwriting suffi- ciently nuanced, to begin to permit certain connoisseurialjudgments that are too rarely relevant for contemporary painting. Their appropriateness here was itselfa mark ofthe 71. Place VII: Bandiagara clffs, by Santi Moix. 2000. Oil on linen, 165.2 by 208.4 cm. (Exh. Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York). 72.

The artist has spoken of hidden or private narratives governing the develop- ment of each composition; and this is per- haps what guarantees him the degree of inventiveness he enjoys. Here too one is aware of a sometimes pungent sometimes elusive perfume, so to speak, from earlier painting. In particular it is rather forgotten mid-century School of Paris abstraction such as that of Dewasne, Deyrolle or Domela that comes to mind. And Nozkowski is neither a parodist, nor an unconscious recycler of styles. He is clearly a deeply informed painter who has found a practice which, while utterly personal, situates him very specifically in his tradition and thus allows genuine innovation. The contemporary to whom he is in some ways closest - though he has more breadth and density and restless resistance to the obvi- ously poetic - is the English artist Prunella Clough. Nozkowski is a mature, firmly established artist, but signs that younger painters might be learning some of his lessons could be found in the group exhibition entitled la la at Tricia Collins Contemporary Art (closed 5th February) which included Jason Rosenberg, Layla Lozano, Warren Isensee and a figurative artist, Michele Basora. (The ideological separation of abstraction and figuration has long since been eroded, no doubt for the best; but again, one sometimes yearns for the focused research that could be implied in the old factionalism.) Lozano's dancing splatters and trails of liquid silver paint deftly dissect the mechanism by which abstract marks take on anthropomorphic dynamism and bodily association. The phe- nomenon has long been exploited by artists from Masson and Gorky to contemporaries such as Cecily Brown, but Lozano has a modesty of format and a direct materiality that could take her into less familiar territory. Jason Rosenberg's confectionery tones and knowingly cute compositions (Fig.72), and Warren Isensee's arrangements of pale, oblate blobs and loops, cleanly rendered and variously grouped, may seem scarcely removed from late formalist exercises. How- ever, in both there was a winning sense of speculative picture-making that might at any moment modulate into genuinely new abstract registers. MERLINJAMES 'See the review in this Magazine, CXL [1998], pp.64-67. New York Stan Douglas and Douglas Gordon It is some consolation to New Yorkers who will not get to see the Canadian artist Stan Douglas's current touring retrospec- tive, organised by the Vancouver Art Muse- um,' that the Dia Center for the Arts has been showing over the past year Douglas's recent video installation piece, Win, place or show (1998; Fig.74) paired in an inspired double feature with Douglas Gordon's film installation, left is right and right is wrong and left is wrong and right is right (1999). The com- bined show (closed 5th March) was called Double Vision, a title apt on more than one level: both artists exhibited diptychs, simul- taneously projected on two abutting hori- zontal screens, and both pieces use and subvert the structures of film narrative to create disturbing, dreamlike alternate universes. The action of Win, place or show consists of two men arguing in a small apartment. The argument is pointless and, like all argu- ments, circular. The cheaply built interior with its flimsy green room divider and its indifferently plastered walls, looks like a low-budget set for a TV series (Fig.74). Every six minutes or so the action repeats itself and the men speak the same lines we have just heard, but they seem to come out differently. The younger man, Donny, picks up the newspaper and reads ajoke; it's not always the same joke, but sometimes it is. The radio plays indistinctly in the back- ground (we can just make out the music from Carmen at one point). There is also the faint, ever-present sound of rain. 'Ever notice how everywhere you go radio sounds the same?' Donny asks. 'Radio stations, news- papers, they could all be from anywhere ... like those scientists out there working on computers, plotting how everything moves . .'. It is, in fact, a computer that, in the immediate present, governs the characters' moves. The six minute mini-drama has been shot in many different short takes from different camera positions and distances all around the room. During the performance, a computer continually re-shuffles the vari- ous takes and decides which combination to project onto the two horizontal screens, which abut each other with a slight space between them. Usually the two screens show the same moment from different angles, but sometimes they combine into what appears to be a single double-wide shot, which, however, doesn't quite match up at the seam in the middle, so that a character might walk to the middle of the diptych and be swallowed up in the seam. Apparently there are a total of 204,023 possible permu- tations of the work. Why is this little drama so compelling? For so it is, even without the background information which, as with all of Stan Doug- las's pieces, we know must underlie it. It is partly the hypnotically fascinating opposi- tion of repetition and variation, almost like music. We wait hopefully for some unsus- pected difference in the text, some surpris- ing new camera angle (there, suddenly for a few seconds, is a close-up of the little dinette set at the back of the apartment), some slip of the tongue that will make the drama take an entirely new turn, solve the riddle and let us out of this strange, dreamlike stasis. About once every cycle the camera looks out of the window onto the rainy city, but that too has a computer-generated look, almost Bladerunner-ish in tones of silvery- black and grey. It seems that in the 1960s Strathcona, a working-class area of Vancouver of small wood frame houses, was earmarked for 'urban renewal', and about a quarter of the area was torn down and rebuilt before local protests halted the project. The set of the apartment that Donny and Bob live in was constructed by Stan Douglas following the plans of one of the huge, international-style apartment buildings designed for single working men in the redevelopment, but never built. Win, place or show takes place continually in an unbuilt world and a future that never happened. The future is marooned in the past. There are certain parallels between Win, place or show and Douglas's 16 mm. film in- stallation Der Sandmann (1995-97), the master- piece which single-handedly made the 1995 Whitney Biennial one of the best exhibitions 259</page></plain_text>
