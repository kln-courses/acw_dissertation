<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOANN WOLSKI CONN WOMEN'S SPIRITUALITY: RESTRICTION &amp; RECONSTRUCTION At the heart of the problem of women's spirituality is a subtle but devastating twist on the Patristic theme: "The glory of God is humanity fully alive." Women in the Christian tradition have unfortunately been led to believe that God is glorified by their humanity only partially alive, because they have been restricted to roles that limit their capacities for self-direction and restrict their ability to experience self-esteem. This article will examine three aspects of women's self-direction and self-esteem. First, how is this an issue in spirituality? Second, what are the central reasons why women's spirituality continues to be problematic? Third, what is being done now, and what can be done in the future to deal with this issue? What is Spirituality? Spirituality as life-experience and as a field of study is no longer iden tified simply with asceticism and mysticism, or with the practice of virtue and methods of prayer. From the perspective of the actualization of the human capacity to be spiritual, to be self-transcending — that is, relational and freely committed spirituality encompasses all of life. In general, religious spirituality is a matter of the experience and/or study of the actualization of human self-transcendence by the Holy, by Ultimate Con cern — that is, by what is acknowledged as "religious." Specifically, Chris tian spirituality involves the actualization of this human capacity through the experience of God, in Jesus the Christ, through the gift of the Spirit. Because this God, Jesus, and the Spirit are experienced through body community-history-influenced human life and symbols, Christian spiri tuality includes every dimension of human life. Thus, Christian spiritual development cannot legitimately be identified as soul development, nor be exclusively associated with development in prayer and virtue. To be adequately experienced and studied, it should be viewed as total human development. When this view is accepted, however, the problematic na ture of women's spiritual development begins to be recognized. Joann Wolski Conn is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Neumann College, Aspon, Pa., and a director of the College Theology Society. JOANN WOLSKI CONN 293</page><page sequence="2">Problematic Nature of Women's Spirituality Realizing that spiritual development is human development, however, makes women's spirituality problematic for three central reasons. First, for women the possibilities for mature humanity/spirituality are re stricted. Models of human development universally recognize that movement away from conformity and predetermined role expectations and toward greater autonomy (i.e. self-direction, self-affirmation, self reliance)1 is necessary for maturity. Yet, women's experience shows that most women are socialized into conformity to a passive role or are arrested at the threshold of autonomy.2 Second, Christian teaching and practice, instead of promoting women's maturity, has significantly contributed to this restriction. Especially sad is the fact that so many women are es tranged from themselves by absorption of the Christian tradition's most common God-images. Third, women's spirituality is problematic because some women judge that religious maturity can really only be accom plished by rejecting biblical tradition, while other women conclude that their spiritual development demands that women and men become cre atively involved in the challenging and long-range task of reconstructing the commonly accepted, male-dominated Christian tradition. Women's humanity I spirituality is restricted Most patterns of family and education continue to reinforce two roles for women. Women are socialized into being desirable objects who dress, think, and act in order to receive acceptance and adulation, especially from males. Living for "another" is the second pervasive role expectation set for women. "Living for" can usually be simply translated: submerge yourself in the other's identity, needs, interests. Thus, a woman's self actualizing potential is often anesthetized. She is taught to wait for some one to find her, and then life will take on purpose and worth. Even career women and members of religious communities do not escape this condi tioning. Junior executive women can become an "office wife" to the boss, taking care of all his detail work and envisioning their purpose in the business as "smoothing the way" so that he can be absorbed in important decisions. For religious women, their community can function as a surro gate identity. They can be encouraged to take on a new work because of "community needs" rather than because they have discerned that this is what they really want and are suited for.3 Because women are often thought to be naturally self-effacing and dedicated, the deeply problematic effects of the way women are con ditioned to this behavior are overlooked. Recent studies show that wom en's behavior that is praised as virtuous (i.e., loving) and mature (i.e., other directed) is actually often behavior symptomatic of severe immatur ity. Women spending themselves on their family, their students, patients, or members of their religious community often have low self-esteem, and thus their emotional dependency makes them subtly very demanding on 294 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="3">others for appreciation and adulation. Their inability to be assertive and their lack of self-worth can result in covert manipulation, pretended helplessness, evasion of conflict situations. Their desire for peace at any price has a high cost: repression of anger can result in bouts of depression. On the other hand, behavior that is criticized as not virtuous, as selfish or immature (e.g., a mother leaving small children in the care of others so that she can pursue an interesting job even though there is no severe financial need, or a member of a religious community questioning her superior's judgment about the appropriateness of an assignment) can be the behavior of a woman whose self-worth is more secure, who is less emotionally dependent and, thus, less demanding and less manipulative in her relationships.4 Because spiritual growth demands movement from an orientation toward heteronomy through autonomy in order to reach an ultimately mature, free relationship to God, women's conditioning toward confor mity to a passive "merger self' rather than a "seeker self' is an especially cruel seduction.5 Women are led to believe they are virtuous when actu ally they have not yet taken the necessary possession of their lives to have an authentic "self' to give in self-donating love. They are often praised as holy when they are still spiritually dwarfed! The central issues of the women's movement focus on women's growing awareness of their need for autonomy in order to be truly human: desire for equality and mutuality in female-male relationship; the need to evalu ate critically one's mother-daughter relationships; demands for symmet rical family patterns of work and parenting; conviction that woman-to woman relations are as life-sustaining as conjugal relations.6 Christian women need networks of assistance which will help them to realize that these are also central issues in the development of their spirituality — that is, of their basic capacities for self-transcending human and God relation ships. The sound assertiveness training that is a common component of programs to help women in transition from traditional roles to more self-directive lives might just as appropriately be a component of spiritual formation programs. An empirical approach to spiritual direction main tains that growth in prayer involves the ability to heighten awareness of what one really wants in life and how one really feels in God's presence.7 Women conditioned to role conformity, to self-doubt, and to dependency may find it quite difficult to get in touch with their own deepest desires or to be peacefully present to a God who respects their adult freedom and calls them friend not servant. Freedom and friendship involve making significant decisions and owning up to the consequences; they involve risk and struggle with ambiguity which insecure women find very difficult, if not impossible, to face. Christian tradition has legitimated a restrictive spirituality for women Christian teaching and treatment of women has been one of the most effective means of legitimating and even promoting restrictive JOANN WOLSKI CONN 295</page><page sequence="4">heteronomy rather than mature autonomy for women. Recent research has so carefully documented the sexism which permeates Christian churches that a few representative examples are sufficient to focus the issue. Jesus' complete acceptance of women's equal dignity and his calling women to full discipleship are clearly, though sometimes reluctantly, recorded in the Gospels.8 However, the Pastoral letters show that early Church practice and attitudes often were not in continuity with the gospel vision in which women were valued in themselves rather than as subordi nate wives or mothers or as unobtrusive virgins.9 From Patristic times to the present women have been presumed to be the image of God only or especially when conformed to male-approved roles which restrict women's self-esteem and self-actualization.10 Why did women support this religious vision so faithfully, and why do many women continue to support it? One of the main reasons is that ministers/priests and women identified religious with domestic values. For example, obedience to God became obedience to one's husband or to children's needs. Domestic virtues of humility and selfless devotion were cited as evidence that women are naturally more religious than men. When women have no other experiential source for rival values or sym bols, they find religion a central means to define themselves and to find community. Religion provided social involvement outside the home in maternal associations and moral reform societies. These had the effect of organizing women and promoting gender-group consciousness. How ever, these effects were quite ambiguous for women. For although volun tary associations encourage some independence and self-definition, they also encourage women to fit into limited, clerically defined roles centered on family and subordinated to male authorities. Thus women's emergence, in these situations, is not necessarily an indication of personal autonomy but rather a continuation of conformity to socially-religiously defined "female responsibility."11 When women's emergence is not ac companied by possibilities for public teaching and governing roles in the Church it is clear that heteronomy continues. Recent Vatican documents continue to project an inconsistent attitude toward women. Statements about women's equality and ability to direct their own lives stand alongside presuppositions about women's appropri ateness for serving in auxiliary, nurturing ministerial roles. The often repeated phrase, "women's different yet complementary role in minis try," is translated into action in almost every case as a subordinate role.12 Hierarchical resistance to canon law revisions that admit women to full participation in church leadership13 leaves no doubt about the way ecclesiastical practice continues to restrict women's spiritual development. Detrimental effects of prevailing God-images Women's mature humanity is also restricted by their absorption of the dominant God-images perpetuated by the fact that Church tradition 296 CROSS CURRENTS / FALL 1980</page><page sequence="5">often ignores or misinterprets basic biblical teaching. What is ignored is the clear affirmation of both the Hebrew and Chris tian Scriptures that God is spirit and, thus, totally transcends sex which is rooted in matter. Such an abstract theological statement is absolutely central to biblical revelation, yet is not often explicitly repeated in Scrip ture. Thus it can easily be obscured by the abundance of anthropomor phic language which, coming from a patriarchal culture, is dominated by the use of masculine pronouns for this spirit God. This male language is in practice often misinterpreted as, in some way, accurately expressing a revelation of God as a male being. There are scattered examples of feminine anthropomorphic language which could balance the picture, reinforcing that God is neither female nor male, but that feminine lan guage is seldom used in liturgical texts or Church documents. Jesus' understandable use of masculine parental language for this spirit God is mistakenly taken as a revelation that God is a male being. Consequently, most women absorb a totally masculine God-image and, thus, can mis takenly presume that men are more like God and women are rightly dependent on men for liturgical mediation of God's presence.14 Women's spirituality is severely damaged by this distortion of biblical revelation. It prevents a woman from valuing and affirming herself as authentically an image of God. It restricts a woman's ability to utilize her own experience as a revelation of God's qualities and activities. It can actually alienate a woman from her own experience when she presumes that "the Holy" is not at all like herself. Just how personally damaging this distortion is, and therefore how problematic the consequent lack of self-esteem can be for women's spiri tuality, is suggested by the research of Dr. Ana-Maria Rizzuto, professor of psychiatry at Tufts Medical School. In The Birth of the Living God, through clinical studies of women's and men's attitudes toward God, Rizzuto both explains how a person's God-image is formed and developed and demonstrates its potential for generating belief or unbelief. The principal research was done with Dr. Rizzuto's patients. However, at later stages of research, she studied persons on her staff at Tufts and found no difference of any significance between her staff members and patients in their way of relating to God.15 It is Rizzuto's central thesis that no child in the Western world brought up in ordinary circumstances reaches school age without forming at least a rudimentary God representation which she/he may use for belief or unbelief. Challenging Freud, Rizzuto makes two key points: 1) belief is not a symptom of pathology; 2) the God-image is more than an "exalted" father; it draws its components from other early objects: mother, grand parents, or even an early aggrandized self-representation. The rest of developmental life may leave the God-image untouched as the person continues to revise parent- and self-representations during the life cycle. Developmentally, a crucial moment for revision of the God-image is late JOANN WOLSKI CONN 297</page><page sequence="6">adolescence. At this stage there is a need to integrate a more cohesive, unified self-representation which will support major decisions about life, career, marriage. This reshuffling brings about new encounters between self-images and God representations. If the God representation is not revised to keep pace with changes in self-representation, it soon becomes experienced as ridiculous or irrelevant or, on the contrary, threatening or dangerous.16 Rizzutô's empirical studies show that "belief in God or its absence de pends upon whether or not a conscious 'identity of experience' can be estab lished between the God representation of a given developmental moment and the object and self-representations needed to maintain a sense of self which provides at least a minimum of relatedness and hope."17 Implications for women's mature spirituality are profound. On the one hand, if women retain a God-image that implies a denial or denigration of women's worth or potential for self-direction and full ministry, this is probably an indicator of unresolved developmental issues. For example, after studying misinterpretations of biblical language, some of my women students will say, "I don't mind that God is pictured only as a man or that we aren't allowed to do the same things men do in the Church." These women, almost without exception, are experiencing male resistance to their desire to be self-directing, or are very insecure and only beginning to sense their own potential. On the other hand, a woman experiencing a shift in self-representation from being dependent and conforming to being more self-directive, more willing to risk making significant deci sions, can be expected to feel a strain in her relation to her God-image if such a woman's God-image works to reinforce a lack of self-esteem and to restrict hope. Such a womari, in order to maintain her spiritual develop ment, must drop that God-image; she must cease to believe in that God. Some women authors who have come to the judgment that they must reject the Jewish-Christian tradition about God explain their decision in a way consonant with Rizzuto's thesis. Everything these women experi enced and knew of Christianity, they say, involved accepting God as ultimately present in male authority figures. Thus, when their self understanding evolved to the point where they moved away from a heteronomous conformity to roles insisted upon by male authorities, they realized that consistency in their life demanded that they renounce belief in the God that legitimated this male domination. These women are convinced that the Christian tradition will support no other God-image and, therefore, they must reject Christianity as a significant source for sustaining their spiritual development.18 Other self-affirming women agree that a solely male God-image must be set aside, yet they find flaws in the position just mentioned. These women pose a series of penetrating questions to those who reject Chris tianity on this ground. Since you can appreciate and even reconstruct such intrinsically patriarchal traditions like that of Freud and Jung, why can 298 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="7">you not do the same with biblical religion? Is it because religious authorities are still too intimidating? Rejection can function as unresolved dependency, as an indication that one is still responding to Jesus and God as oppressive fathers rather than encountering them as God-images which might have some liberating things to say as well as some severe cultural limitations. In addition, are you not sometimes writing about the Jewish-Christian tradition in such a simplistic way that, if this same method were applied to Buddhism or Hinduism you would be inclined to characterize the writers as very poorly educated in that tradition or even as bigots?19 Such challenging criticism is a demonstration that women religious scholars have "come of age." As adults they can deal with conflicting opinions and need not repress disagreement in order to project the illusory picture of a united front which actually hides insecurity. They are secure enough to raise difficult issues. What is more, they are courageous enough to face the full implications of renouncing a patriarchal Chris tianity while still hoping to find in Christianity resources for a mature spirituality. They are facing the call to reconstruct that tradition. Reconstructing a Tradition To Support Women's Spirituality A reconstructed Christian tradition is slowly emerging as women and men become aware of the detrimental effects of patriarchy on everyone and especially on women. Women's spirituality can be supported if all of us, both women and men, make progress in a twofold process. To begin, we must reexamine presuppositions about human development, discover the history of women's experience and leadership that has never been told, and explicate the women-liberating insights implicit in biblical teach ing about God. As soon as we have these resources available we must begin to incorporate them into every aspect of life and ministry: teaching, writing, celebrating, praying, counseling, reconciling, befriending, pro testing. As long as this process remains "frontier territory," experienced as the unknown and fraught with risk, women's spirituality will continue to be especially problematic. Examining models of human development Of the growing number of studies in this area the contributions of two women can serve as examples of significant new viewpoints. Carol Gilligan has examined the limitations of the developmental mod els constructed by Kohlberg and Erikson. These limitations result from their reliance on a predominantly male data base for their theorizing.20 Kohlberg describes the most mature level of moral development in terms of a person living according to universal principles of justice and respect for individual rights. For the men Kohlberg studied, the moral imperative is expressed as an injunction to respect the rights of others and to protect from interference the right to life and self-fulfillment. How JOANN WOLSKI CONN 299</page><page sequence="8">ever, for the women Gilligan interviewed the moral imperative repeatedly emerged as an injunction to care, a responsibility to discern and alleviate the world's trouble. In Kohlberg's view these women are judged to be developmentally immature, not yet to have moved beyond the interper sonal level and followed the path toward independent, principled judg ment he found in the research on men from which his stages were derived.21 Gilligan suggests that Kohlberg's repeated finding of de velopmental inferiority in women may have more to do with the standard used for measurement than with the quality of women's moral thinking.22 A more adequate standard, says Gilligan, would be one which incorpo rates the "moral voices" of both women and men. Development for both sexes then would involve an integration of rights and responsibilities through a principled understanding of the complementarity of these male and female views. For the women Gilligan studied, this integration of rights and responsibilities appears to take place through a principled understanding of equality and reciprocity. For the men Kohlberg studied, it appears to be the recognition through experience of the need for a more active responsibility in taking care that corrects the potential indifference of a morality of noninterference. Aware of the fact that social conventions now lend a particular shape to women's and men's moral experience, Gilligan envisions a general standard which could admit this diversity and promote genuine complementarity. Using such a standard, Gilligan con cludes that in the development of mature morality women come to see the violence generated by inequitable relationships, while men come to realize the limitations of a conception of justice blinded to the real inequities of human life.23 Although Erikson's life-cycle research recognizes the differences in women's and men's experience, Gilligan notes the limitation caused by the fact that Erikson does not incorporate women's experience into the nor mative model. Erikson observes: while for men identity precedes intimacy and generativity in the ideal cycle of differentiation, separation, and later attachment, for women these tasks seem, rather, to be fused. Intimacy goes along with identity as a woman comes to know herself through relationships with others. Erikson presumes this is a matter of meeting a man by whose name she will be known and by whose status she will be defined. In any case, the cycle-stages are admittedly different for women and men. Nevertheless, Gilligan observes, Erikson charts the life-cycle stages using only male experience to define development: identity con tinues to precede intimacy in his conception. Consequently, given Erik son's scheme, in the life cycle there is little preparation for the intimacy of the first adult stage. Only the initial stage of trust versus mistrust suggests the kind of mutuality Erikson means by intimacy and generativity. Other stages emphasize separation and differentiation.24 However, women's development, as Gilligan's research demonstates, is marked by a recogni tion of the way interdependence can create strength, build resources, and 300 CROSS CURRENTS / FALL 1980</page><page sequence="9">motivate giving in the mature feminine style. The elusive element in women's development lies in its admission of the continuing importance of attachment in the human life cycle. Gilligan maintains that only when life-cycle theorists divide their attention equally and begin to understand women's experience as well as they have understood men's experience will their vision be adequate and their theories become correspondingly more fertile.25 A second new viewpoint is Georgia Sassen's recent reexamination of women's response to our commonly held model of human success. It has led her to suggest that we reconstruct our basic institutions.26 Martina Horner's research in 1968 concluded that 65% of the women studied showed anxiety over success because they anticipated that success in competitive achievement activity, especially against men, produced social rejection and loss of femininity. These results were so widely ac cepted that "fear of success" became a common expectation in research on women.27 Sassen took another look at that research and came to a different conclusion. Defining anxiety as a sense of disintegration occurring when a person is unable to make meaning,28 Sassen judges that the women in the original research were not simply afraid. They were, rather, unable to take competitive success and construct a vision to which they could per sonally be committed. Their knowing structure was oriented more to preserving and fostering relationships than toward winning. What should be done about these results? Some people favor teaching women how to "succeed in a man's world." Sassen suggests, on the contrary, that society affirm the structures and values women bring to the issue of competition versus relationship and reconstruct institutions according to these values and structures.29 How does this affect women's spirituality? Women are especially com mitted to replace the emphasis on clericalism and hierarchical leadership in institutions which embody Christian ministry. Speaking from their own experience of attempting to live out communitarian, mutual workstyles which affirm gifts of ministry in all persons, they admit their scruples about being identified with a Church whose hierarchical response to women's desire for complete equality often treats that desire as an inap propriate desire to compete with men.30 Priests' refusal to relate to women in liturgical settings with an invitation to full participation creates a widen ing gap between liturgy and women's spirituality.31 Of course, there are also some men who are uncomfortable about defining success as competition. Since Vatican II priests commonly say that successful authority and leadership can only be service, not competi tive domination. The deliberate need to renounce power is a growing concern.32 Thus it is especially anguishing to women that they are sys tematically excluded from an equal share in areas which demand nurtur ing qualities they have "specialized in" for years. JOANN WOLSKI CONN 301</page><page sequence="10">Women must and do admit their collaboration in perpetuating this unhealthy model of human success by often encouraging men in their competitive ideal of history making, rather than criticizing that ideal.33 The challenge now is to grow together in fostering a renewed model of humanity. Recovering women's experience and leadership Christian women's spiritual growth, in addition to models of human development which explicitly include their experience, requires satisfac tion of the basic need for meaning and identity. Indispensable here is the need to recover the general history of women's religious experience. Urgent also is the need to tell the story of women's leadership. Because meaning requires imagination,34 women need to picture their own past and have role models to support their vision for the future. Although the field of women's history is young it has already developed through three phases or approaches. As in human growth, tasks of earlier stages remain significant even when later tasks emerge. Compensatory history was naturally the first phase. Because so many notable women are missing from traditional history, especially from re ligious history, this continues to be a long-term undertaking. Whereas the first phase documented oppression — handicapped sometimes by accep tance of these women as exceptional or even deviant (i.e. deviant from male-defined history and norms) — scholars have now moved to inves tigating how women operated in a male-defined world on their own terms.35 Phase two recovers women's experience expressed in their own words and, among many issues, investigates the extent to which women's religi ous experience indicates that a struggle for self-affirmation, self definition, and autonomous self-donation are intrinsic to their conversion and progress in holiness. For example, Penelope Washbourn's cross-cultural research on pre contemporary women shows how that particular tradition of female spiri tuality centers on the affirmation of female sexuality in its many seasons of change. Drawing from songs, prayers, liturgies, prose and poetry com posed by women, Washbourn demonstrates that the symbols and forms of women's worship, prayer and celebration express women's bodily experi ence: menstruation, passionate love and longing, motherhood or barren ness, and aging. The question for her modern readers is not how we can duplicate the past, but how we can discover in our new roles — which are defined in terms wider than fertility — a sense of worship which appro priately incorporates bodily experience in the many seasons of life.36 Studies of Teresa of Avila's spiritual development are nothing new. However, studies which incorporate the concerns of the present article are seeing Τ eresa's experience from a quite new angle of vision. Catherine Cress Romano has examined the struggles through which Teresa eventu ally found her own way to integrate passionate love and history-making work, given Teresa's erotic personality in her patriarchal Spanish culture. 302 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="11">Romano interprets Teresa's conversion struggle as rooted in an unresol ved adolescent identity crisis, or as assumption of a sick identity incapable of integrating body, early adolescent feelings of competence, and capacity for leadership and love of challenge, with the female roles permitted in her male-dominated culture. Her will to change was hampered by her immature pattern: excessive dependence, neurotic need for love, unex pressed anger turned instead toward herself.37 Exhaustion of old defenses and, eventually, autonomous self surrender to another force was Teresa's way, at mid-life, out of her old pattern. Teresa surrendered to a force (a faith-interpretation sees God working through this force) coming through her experience of con templating the wounded Christ suffering for her, accepting and loving her. This experience enabled Teresa to recognize and accept her anger at restrictions placed on her competence, to accept her own humanity and erotic feelings, and to reenter the world and create a new Teresa and a new environment of activity in which she plays a leading role.38 However, according to Romano, to handle the conflicts this leadership generated in her culture, Teresa's socialization led her to develop a new neurosis: she projected her wishes entirely onto Christ rather than accept them as genuinely her own. That is, Teresa could accept leadership only as an act of obedience to Christ who commanded it.39 Nevertheless, as Teresa consciously surrendered to her new states of ecstasy, she grew more confident of her new relationship to Christ as being her own relationship. In later life she admitted only one true authority in her life and that was the Christ of her visions.40 Romano thus explores a theme of particular interest to women: Teresa's progress in holiness necessitated a struggle for autonomy and self-affirmation. Other pioneering research in women's history has uncovered the way women's own ideals of holiness integrated love and intellect, and empow ered women to challenge family and social expectations and to esteem a self-chosen life.41 Because the spiritual tradition of women is often carried on in recent times outside the official context of religion, studies of women's fiction offer helpful resources for women's spirituality. This literature demonstrates how women's spiritual quest concerns women's awakening to forces of energy larger than the self, to powers of connection with nature and with other women, and to acceptance of body. For women, conversion is not so much giving up egocentric notions of power as passing through an experience of nothingness finally to gain power over their own lives.42 In summary, this second phase of women's history has already recov ered sufficient evidence about women's experience to challenge basic assumptions about women's natural passivity or innate possession of religious virtue. Most important of all, though, it provides women today with resources for praise, pride, and power to affirm their own unique JOANN WOLSKI CONN 303</page><page sequence="12">spirituality. A third phase is emerging in which women view themselves not as another minority but, more accurately, as the majority of humanity. Now the question becomes: what would history itself look like if seen through women's eyes and values? Let me give just one example of the consequent shift in basic patterns of meaning. Elisabeth Schtissler Fiorenza recon structs early Christian history according to a new interpretive model which sees the early Christian movement basically as a conflict movement struggling with acceptance of egalitarian leadership relations rather than as an intrinsically patriarchal society trying to restrain heresy and pre serve orthodoxy.43 Because all historical reconstructions, including the New Testament, are not facts but interpretations, we must evaluate the interpretive model through which references to persons and events are already filtered. That Western culture is interpreted through a systematic androcentrism is evident in the fact that nobody questions the historical role of men as agents in the Church. Only the leadership role of women is problematic because maleness is the norm. Given her command of the sources, Fiorenza has no trouble showing how the Lukan Easter narrative omits other material favorable to women's full apostleship and how the Pastoral letters require that the structures of leadership be patterned after the patriarchal family structure. But was this an inevitable development?44 Any insistence that it was inevitable overlooks the fact that these pat riarchal structures were not the only institutional options available to and realized by Christians. Since women such as Phoebe were founders and leaders of house churches (Rom. 16:1-3), the missionary house churches seem to have been patterned after egalitarian private associations and not after the patriarchal household.45 What is even more significant is the evidence that patriarchal structures are not normative because the Jesus traditions promote egalitarian im pulses; they are not patriarchally defined. They record that, although women in ancient culture were socially marginal and religiously inferior, Jesus included women as disciples and primary witnesses of the resurrec tion. Since discipleship replaced traditional family bonds (Mk 3:35), women disciples are no longer defined by the patriarchal order of mar riage and family. It is not natural motherhood but being Jesus' disciple that is decisive. Why? A sevenfold transmission of the snyoptic tradition proclaiming that the first and the leaders should be last and slaves, demonstrates that Jesus radically criticized social and religious hierarchi cal and patriarchal relationships of dependence and domination. God's fatherhoood prohibits any ecclesial patriarchal self-definition. Christ's lordship rules out any relationship of dominance within the Christian community.46 When this egalitarian impulse becomes the defining element in the interpretive model for reconstructing early Christian history we can do 304 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="13">justice to all the New Testament traditions and need not eliminate or downplay women's discipleship and leadership.47 Women's and men's spirituality can thus be nourished and challenged by the radical call to egalitarian relationship to Jesus ("I have not called you servants but friends.") which could be the pattern for all our relationships, and the inspiration for new theology. The Leadership Conference of Women Religious has already begun to incorporate implications of this reconstruction in its suggestions for a contemporary theology of the vows, particularly the vow of obedience. If to vow obedience meant to commit oneself to a personal quest for freedom and holiness in a community context and to involve oneself in a broader human quest for the liberation of all people both by a prophetic challenge to structures of domination and by a construc tive participation in the evolution of new models of community the vow would make sense not only to religious but to their contem poraries.48 Reinterpreting familiar God-images The importance of symbolism for spirituality cannot be overestimated. The experience of grace cannot be accurately recognized or correctly interpreted without the help of symbols derived from the world of ordi nary sensory experience. Any image or analogy naturally has limited ability to express symbolically God's self-communication, to be revela tion.49 However, it is the common interpretation of symbols, as we saw earlier in this article, that has been particularly limiting for women's spirituality. Therefore, attention to recent reinterpretations of familiar God-images and to their liberating and challenging implications will con clude this article. For centuries, interpreters of scripture have explored the male lan guage of faith. Now, like the housekeeper of Luke 15:8, Phyllis Trible, among other scholars, has lit a lamp and once more swept the house of biblical tradition to find the lost coin: female imagery and motifs.50 Scripture itself, in the formal parallelism between the phrases "male and female" and "in the image of God" (Gen 1:27) provides the metaphor which Trible uses as the basic clue in her search. This metaphorical language carefully preserves the otherness of God. The Hebrew term the-image-of stresses the difference between Creator and creature. God is neither male nor female, nor any combination of the two. Yet Genesis teaches that to understand the basic metaphor, male and female, is to have a human clue for detecting divine reality.51 According to Trible, this metaphor functions in two ways. First, it directs attention to partial expressions of the image of God-male: the father (Ps 103:13), the husband (Hos 2:16), the king (Ps 98:6). In the same way, images of God the pregnant woman (Isa 42:4), the mother (Isa 66:13), the midwife (Ps 22:9) are partial expressions of God-female. However, precisely because the metaphor presents a balanced image while JOANN WOLSKI CONN 305</page><page sequence="14">biblical language is imbalanced in favor of male metaphors, it provides Trible with an impetus to seek out female language for God. Using literary tools which demonstrate the inseparability of biblical form and content, Trible examines a term which saturates scripture: the root word rahamim which in the singular form means "womb" and in the plural expands to mean "compassion, mercy, love" — the most persistent biblical description of God. Trible sketches a cumulative poetic picture of Yahweh as a deity who conceived, was pregnant, writhed in labor pains, brought forth a child, and nursed it.52 If religious education and homilies would consistently proclaim these powerful metaphors perhaps more women (and men) could identify with Arlene Swidler's liberating experience. I find that retiring to my room at a quiet hour. . . and putting myself in the presence of God who is my Mother is the most relaxing and invigorating spiritual experience I know.53 In How Do I Pray? eight other women and nineteen men joined Arlene Swidler in answering the title question. This booklet provides some clear evidence that female language, though just as appropriate for God as male language, is not yet used with equal comfort even by persons with good theological training. All the men used exclusively masculine God language. Of the women, four used only masculine God-language, four used neutral language (i.e., no personal pronouns), and only one ex plicitly voiced comfort with feminine language. The only male theolo gians I know of whose books use feminine God-language in equal meas ure with masculine are Matthew Fox and John Carmody.54 Besides directing attention to female language for the deity, the image of God, male and female, guides Trible's research in a second way. It directs attention to three scriptural traditions which embody male and female within the common context of the goodness of creation. First, Trible explains, in a way that non-biblical scholars can easily understand, that Genesis 2 is a life story that culminates in a poem to sexuality as man and woman become one flesh of mutuality and harmony. However, this equality disintegrates through disobedience; subordina tion is the consequence of sin; the curse is upon the serpent, not the woman, in Genesis 3. The Song of Songs, on the other hand, recovers the grace of sexuality, not the sin of sexism. In this love poetry, so widely commented upon by mystics and Church fathers, there is no male domi nance, no female subordination, and no stereotyping of either sex. Trible demonstrates how the portrayal of the woman actually defies the connota tions of the "second sex." She works, keeps vineyards and flocks. Throughout the song she is independent and fully the man's equal. Although he sometimes approaches her, she most often initiates their meetings. Her movements are bold and open; she describes love with revealing images. Never is she called a wife nor required to bear children. Love for the sake of love is the Song's message, and the portrayal of the 306 CROSS CURRENTS I FALL 1980</page><page sequence="15">female delineates this message best. Third, Trible shows that the tradition in the book of Ruth actively challenges and transforms the male culture that it reflects. It has a happy ending because the brave, bold decisions of women embody and bring to pass the blessings of God. Strong women make a new beginning with a strong man who reacts to their initiative. At the end, having suffered and struggled, the image of God, male and female, rejoices in the goodness of life.55 If, as Trible demonstrates, the image of God-female can be strong, initiating, brave, self-defining, what about the image of God-male? Are the male qualities which patriarchy emphasizes and legitimates really the central qualities of God the father in Jesus' religious heritage or in his own teaching about God? Robert Hammerton-Kelly, explicitly acknowledging women's legitimate concerns with this question, explores the way Hebrew and Christian scriptures depict God's fatherhood as directly challenging the patriarchal family as normative for mediating God's presence. When God rules, only free, reciprocal love is praised or promoted.56 One of the most persistent themes of Scripture is the call to leave the familiar and risk going into the unknown, with trust that God is present in the new situation. I believe this call echoes in the issues raised in the present article. One strand of Christian tradition has consistently taught that God's glory is humanity fully alive. Now, however, I believe many women and men are being called to respond to the challenge of a new Christian anthropology — new because it explicitly acknowledges and affirms women's experience. I believe that God is only glorified when this inclusive humanity is fully alive! FOOTNOTES 'Jane Loevinger, "Stages of Ego Development," in Adolescents' Development and Education, ed. Ralph L.

However, whereas male roles stress self-affirmation and differentiation from others, women's roles reinforce passivity and submersion in others' needs.
