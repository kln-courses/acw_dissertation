<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONALD PALUMBO Northern Michigan University THE CRISIS OF FAITH, FATHER-SON RUPTURES, AND ALIENATION-FROM-THE-SELF: THEIR INTERCONNECTION IN THE WORKS OF SARTRE AND CAMUS Camus and Sartre agree that the idea of God's absence condemns man to his sense of alienation, and the profound alienation suffered by their protag- onists is presented as both an indication and a consequence of that absence. This alienation reveals itself in a number of ways: the failure of father-son relationships, alienation-from-the-self, social and sexual alienation, and a sense of separation from nature, the past, and the present. Of these manifes- tations, the failure of father-son relationships is that which most clearly symbolizes, as well as indicates and precipitates, man's isolation from God. Alienation-from-the-self, which partially results from man's abandonment of the idea of God, is also closely related to the failure of father-son relationships; and these are the two types of alienation that stem most immediately from the crisis of faith. Several of Sartre's and Camus' characters reveal a consciousness of the general connection between alienation and the abandonment of God. In Sartre's The Devil and the Good Lord Goetz laments, "I killed God because He divided me from mankind, and now I see that His death has isolated me even more surely."1 In Camus' The Possessed, Shatov tells Stavrogin, "You can't love anyone because you are a man without roots and without faith."2 And in rejecting Zeus to embrace his freedom, Orestes discovers in Sartre's The Flies that in severing relations with God one cuts oneself off from both men and the world. He complains to Zeus, after he rebels against Him, "Yes- terday, when I was with Electra, I felt at one with Nature, this Nature of your making - Suddenly, out of the blue, freedom crashed down on me and swept me off my feet. Nature sprang back, my youth went with the wind, and I knew myself alone, utterly alone in the midst of this well-meaning little universe of yours."3 Although he formed a bond of blood between himself and the people of Argos in killing Aegisthus, Orestes must exile himself from the city if he is to relieve them of their remorse and defy Zeus; he can remain as King only if he accepts Zeus' will, accepts God, and maintains the status quo. Those characters who most completely reject God are not only those who are most aware of their alienation but are also those who most often exhibit symptoms of alienation, for the alienation between man, his fellows, and the 12</page><page sequence="2">world is the sign as well as the consequence of man's isolation from God. Although man's alienation - in all of its aspects taken together - indicates his divorce from God, this divorce is most clearly and appropriately symbolized in the nature of father-son relationships. The father, like a king or tsar, is a secular emblem of God, particularly to a child, over whom the father's power, like God's, is seemingly absolute. In the works of Sartre and Camus (and in those of other modern existentialist writers) the feeling that one has been abandoned by the father often parallels the feeling of having been abandoned by God, while indifference to or rejection of the father is likewise mirrored in a character's indifference to or rejection of the idea of God. Even on a literal level Orestes rebels against Zeus in killing Aegisthus, his step-father and the king; but he also symbolically abolishes God in thus avenging his father's death, for the king (who rules by divine right and assumes the figurative role of father to his people) is, even more than a biological or legal father, an earthly representation of the divinity. And, although there are many cases where such information is withheld, not one of Sartre's or Camus' protago- nists in Nausea, The Flies, The Devil and the Good Lord, The Condemned of Altona, The Stranger, The Plague, or The Possessed is portrayed as having a successful relation- ship with his father, just as few (and none of those whose parental relation- ships are revealed to us) believe in the possibility of communion with God. Many central characters feel that they have been abandoned or betrayed by their fathers, and it might well be that it is in half-conscious, symbolic revenge that these characters later dismiss the idea of God or even rebel against Him. Goetz declares that he's a bastard and that he has turned to evil to reject the world that has rejected him; fatherless, he seeks to avenge himself on a God who has assigned him, through his illegitimacy, the role of outcast. We first encounter Goetz as a cynical warlord dedicated to evil. He later consecrates himself to good, as a proof of his absolute freedom of will, only to reabandon himself finally to the unsavory role initially assigned him when he recognizes that all he had done in his quest for good had produced only more suffering and greater evil. He realizes at one point that the love of the peasants, which he has sought through his charity and his charade of saintliness, only makes him more aware of his isolation from the divine; for while he has become a "roof" and a "heaven" for others, a father-and-God-figure to them, he, like Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor, has no heaven that he can believe in. He laments, "Heaven is an empty hole. I even wonder where God lives." When, regardless of his intentions, his actions all result in evil, he complains to Heinrich, I supplicated, I demanded a sign, I sent messages to Heaven, no reply. Heaven ignored my very name. Each minute I wondered what I could be in the eyes of God. Now I know the answer: nothing. God does not see me, God does not hear me, God does not know me. You see this gap in the door? It is God. You see that hole in the ground? That is God again. Silence is God. Absence is God. God is the loneliness of man. There was no one but myself; I alone decided on Evil; and I alone invented Good - I am going to tell you a colossal joke: God doesn't exist. Goetz's search for God discovers only the absence and alienation his search for a father would have led him to.4 Johanna accurately generalizes of the entire Gerlach family, "You believe in neither God nor the Devil."5 And Peyre notes that "in the collapse of the father whom his son once worshipped and who dies when that son has turned 13</page><page sequence="3">against him, Nietzschean undertones of the death of God may be audible"6 in Sartre's The Condemned of Aliona. Franz himself likens his father, whom he had rejected when be betrayed a fugitive rabbi to the Nazis, to the God he also rejects in noting to Johanna that "he created me in his image" and in observing to him that as "there isn't a God . . . you're my natural judge."7 Camus' Jean Tarrou, an avowed athiest, rediscovers in The Plague that "it is in the thick of calamity that one gets hardened to the truth - in other words, to [God's] silence."8 And Tarrou is disillusioned in his father, who must supervise the execution of criminals in his capacity of prosecuting attorney, when, as a child, he goes to court and hears him demand the death penalty for an offender. Nearly a year later Tarrou leaves home on the eve of a prospective execution, rejecting his father as he will later reject that God whom he feels condemns all men to death. Ever since his disillusionment, as Friedman notes, "Tarrou's chief aim in life has been to side with the 'victims' rather than 'executioners,'"9 and he thus fights, not only against the plague, but also on the losing side in the Spanish Civil War, i.e., against God and the king. Peter Verkhovensky and all in his circle of nihilistic revolutionaries are unbelievers, as is Stavrogin, who would be a Christian if he could believe but who argues "to make a jugged hare, you need a hare. To believe in God, you need a God." Peter's hatred of and rebellion against the tsar parallels his hatred of and rebellion against God, and his attitude towards both is mirrored in his attitude towards his father, Stepan. Peter feels his father had aban- doned him early in life and complains, "I wasn't weaned yet when you shipped me off to Berlin by the post. Like a parcel." When they meet after twenty years' separation, Peter breaks free of his father's embraces and insists that he be left alone. Cruelly proclaiming that he never reads Stepan's letters through, Peter nevertheless betrays his father's confidences by maliciously revealing their delicate contents in public. He calls Stepan a "parasite," claims that Varvara Petrovna is "keeping" him, and boasts to his face of having laughed at his love letters to her. When the father, infuriated by this abuse, rhetorically asks, "Are you or aren't you my son, Monster?" Peter mockingly replies, "You must know better than I. To be sure, fathers are inclined to have illusions about such things."10 In Camus' The Siranger, Meursault, when pressed, reveals his complete lack of faith to an absolutely incredulous magistrate and, later, to a chiding prison chaplain. He reports, "I said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether I believed or didn't was, to my mind, a question of so little importance." Earlier, in thinking of his father, Meursault recalls, "I never set eyes on him. Perhaps the only things I really knew about him were what mother had told me." He, like Peter, had been abandoned in his infancy. Significantly, the prosecutor concludes his case against Meursault by telling the jury, "I am convinced . . . that you will not find I am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say that he is also guilty of the murder to be tried tomorrow in this court," which is "that most odious of crimes, the murder of a father by his son." Meursault has long since slain God, to whom he is as indifferent as he is to the memory of his father, in his heart; while it is logically and practically absurd, the prosecutor's summation, as Rhein notes, reveals this aspect of his trial's symbolic meaning.11 The failure of the father-son relationship combines with the initial sense of 14</page><page sequence="4">Goďs absence to contribute to yet another mode of alienation, alienation- from-the-self . Friedman argues that "the father is the first and often the most lasting image of man for the son. It not infrequently happens, however, that the father is not really present for the son, either because he is dead or absent or inattentive, or because he is in no sense a father, or because he is too weak or desipicable for a son to be able to emulate him." In those cases where the father is a physical, even a perversely dominant presence, however, the son inevitably receives from him a share of his personality; and the son is estranged from and rejects a part of himself to the extent that he is estranged from and rejects the father. Also, "the inner division which results from the alienation between fathers and sons is as much a commentary on the absence of a modern image of man as on the breakdown of the specific father-son relationship. At the heart of this breakdown, in fact, is the inability of the father to give his son a direction-giving image of meaningful and authentic human existence." To a large extent, man's image of his ideal self and his anthropomorphic image of God coincide. The rejection of this image of God inevitably erodes the concomitant image of man, and the father cannot provide his son with a direction-giving image of man because, having also abandoned his idea of God, as in Herr Gerlach's case, he has no coherent image of man himself. Finally, the frequency with which certain characters are depicted in non-human terms in Camus' and Sartre's works both indicates that their authors associate the realization of God's non-existence with this erosion of the image of man and further suggests alienation-from-the-self, from a character's "human" nature.12 Goetz specifically attributes his alienation-from-self to his father, although he has never met him. He tells Heinrich, "I have been two people all my life; my mother gave herself to a no-account, and I am composed of two halves which do not fit together; each of those halves shrinks in horror from the other." Goetz makes the fact of this division within himself absolutely clear. "I have hated myself for fifteen years," he rails. After surviving an assassination attempt he informs Catherine, "I can never be angry with anyone who tries to kill me. I understand their point of view too well." And he later assures Heinrich, "Half of myself is your accomplice against the other half." Heinrich, who finally loses his faith also - who, fatally stabbed in his struggle with Goetz and face to face with death, cries out "there will be nothing, nothing, nothing" and expires - evinces a similar (if less openly articulated) duality when, unable to accept responsibility for the decisions forced upon him and overwhelmed by a sense of guilt, he invents an imaginary "devil" (the alter- ego of his "good" self) to shoulder the blame for those deeds he can neither justify nor avoid.13 Other characters created by Camus and Sartre also exhibit unmistakable signs of alienation-from-self. Although this division cannot always be attri- buted to their relationship with their fathers, it always parallels their atheism; and it is in one other case clearly a product of father-son conflict. Franz turned against a part of himself when he rebelled against his father; significantly, he especially hates himself for having tortured the partisans, a duty to his men that he feels he could not have avoided and an act that he associates with his father's betrayal of the rabbi. Clearly, the detested model provided by his father has prevented him from rebuilding a viable, unified sense of self. Yet, ironically, it is in his alienation-from-self that Franz actually does again 15</page><page sequence="5">resemble his father; Herr Gerlach who, as his daughter, Leni, notes, "no longer believes in anything," also suffers an internal disassociation. He claims he receives orders from himself, and he advised Werner, "If you want to command, think of yourself as someone else." Confronted with Franz's repul- sion he admits, "You know, I didn't like myself, either."14 Sartre indicates in Nausea that Roquentin, who has no relatives as far as we know, is suffering from an internal disassociation also, and further reinforces the suggestion of alienation-from-self revealed in some of his other charac- ters through metaphorically linking them with the inhuman or sub-human and thus hinting that they are divorced from their human nature itself. In setting these characters apart from the human Sartre also indicates their social alienation in signifying that they are pariahs, intrinsically alien in human society. Goetz, who consciously thinks he is such an outcast, cries out in his despair, "What does it matter anyway? Monster or saint, I didn't give a damn, I wanted to be inhuman."15 Roquentin's atheism is unequivocal. He writes, "The sylphs all around me have let themselves be taken in: they see the thin film, which proves the existence of God. I see beneath it." And Roquentin expresses a romantic desire to be liberated from all "existing" things and from his body in particular; he feels that his body, like everything else, is absurd. The hint of alienation- ]from-the-self implicit in this rejection of his body is strengthened by the fact that Roquentin conceives of his body in non-human terms. Contemplating his face in a mirror he notes, "When I was little my aunt Bigeois told me 'If you look at yourself too long in the mirror, you'll see a monkey.' I must have looked at myself much longer than that: what I see is well below the monkey, on the fringe of the vegetable world, at the level of jellyfish - I draw my face closer until it touches the mirror. The eyes, nose and mouth disappear: nothing human is left." Sartre's preferred symbol of the non-human in man is not the monkey or jellyfish, however; it is the crab. Roquentin recalls that when he was eight years old he and his friends had been frightened by the sight of a madman. He writes, "We had a horrible fear of him because we sensed he was alone. . . . We felt that he was shaping thoughts of crab or lobster in his head. And that terrified us, the fact that one could conjure thoughts of lobsters on the sentry-box, on our hoops, on the bushes." Roquentin fears that such a fate awaits him too in his loneliness. Later, in imagining that the other patrons in the restaurant where he had just dined with the Self-Taught Man are observing his exit, he suspects that "they are watching my back with surprise and disgust; they thought I was like them, that I was a man, and I deceived them. I suddenly lost the appearance of a man and they saw a crab running backwards out of this human room." At one point he notices that the Self-Taught Man's hand is "like a fat white worm," that his own up-turned hand "looks like an animal turned upside down," and that his fingers, when moved rapidly, are "like the claws of a crab which has fallen on its back." Franz too reveals the sub-human in The Condemned of Altona when, alone in his room, he imitates the sideways walk of the crab-people.16 Camus (no doubt inspired by the characterization of Roquentin) also rec- ognizes the presence of the inhuman in man, seeing it both in man's trivial actions and in the core of his being. He writes, Men, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of 16</page><page sequence="6">their gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show; youwonder why he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man's own inhumanity, this incalculable tumble before the image of what we are, this "nausea," as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd. Likewise the stranger who at certain seconds comes to meet us in a mirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we encounter in our own photographs is also the absurd.17 Since his inherent inhumanity reveals the divergence between man as a reality and man as a concept invented by men, Camus sees the absurd, which often prompts or is recognized through a character's lossof faith, both in it and in the alienation-from-self that it suggests. Camus argues further that man can see himself as being human only through social relationships, that "in simple words, man is not recognized - and does not recognize himself - as a man as long as he limits himself to subsisting like an animal. He must be acknowledged by other men. All con- sciousness is, basically, the desire to be recognized and proclaimed as such by other consciousnesses. It is others who beget us. Only in association do we receive a human value, as distinct from an animal value."18 That certain characters see themselves in non-human terms is, then, symptomatic of their extensive social alienation, of which father-son ruptures is the beginning, as well as of their alienation-from-self.
