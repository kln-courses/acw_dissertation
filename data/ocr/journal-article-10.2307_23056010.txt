<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOUISE JOY Emotions in Translation: Helen Maria Williams and "Beauties Peculiar to the English Language" Our eyes, bathed in tears, met and discoursed together in the silent language of the unhappy,1 JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU'S JULIE, OU LA NOUVELLE IfLI.OJSE: LETTRES DE Deux Amants Habitants d'Une Petite Ville au Pied des Alpes (1760) caused a sensation, not only in French-speaking Europe but among British readers too. Just months after its publication in French, William Kenrick produced an English translation entitled Eloisa, or a Series of Original Letters (1761), which went through more than fifteen editions before 1810. Claiming in his Preface to this work that translations "that appear like a thin gauze spread over the original [reflect] want of attention, or want of ability in the translator," Kenrick made substantial changes to Rousseau's novel, aspiring "to improve and adorn [it] with beauties peculiar to the English language." He "could never," he insists, "copy the failings of [the] author, be his repu tation ever so great."2 The translator, he contends, has a license and a re sponsibility to amend the errors of the original. Faithfulness must be sacrificed to integrity so that the translation emulates, rather than simply re produces, the foreign text it showcases. The most overt of Kenrick's modifications is his revision of the title and the name of the central protagonist from Julie to Eloisa, on the basis that this is the name by which Rousseau's novel had become known to the British public.3 His alteration consolidates a parallel between the novel's 1.

By accentuating Rousseau's comparatively unobtrusive metaphor, Kenrick fosters for British readers an unspoken affinity between the French novel and Alexander Pope's widely read poem, "Eloisa to Abelard" (1717), also affectionately known among eighteenth-century readers as "Eloisa."4 Through this intertextual allusion, Kenrick grounds his translation of the (already notorious) French novel in a familiar British tradition figure-headed by Pope, whose reputation as one of the preeminent moral poets of the century safeguards the territory. His alteration indicates that British and French readers differ in the fastidious ness of their moral standards, implying that the moral standards of British readers are more stringent than those of their French counterparts. For Kenrick, then, conscientious translation of a novel from French to English involves strengthening the work's moral framework to ensure that it meets the more rigorous demands of its British readership.5 In Julia, a Novel; Interspersed with Some Poetical Pieces (1790), Helen Maria Williams anglicizes La Nouvelle Helo'ise even further by refining its moral framework so that it does not merely satisfy the moral expectations of its British audience, but surpasses them. To this end she changes the category of emotions at the heart of the novel, transposing what in Rousseau's novel are extreme, uncontrolled, erotically charged passions into moderate, con trolled, platonic affections. By establishing consistent and unambiguous unity between Julia's internal feelings and her external emotions, Williams endows her heroine with an integrity she implies is lacking in the protago nist of the French novel, whose facade of outer calmness conceals inner ine's name to an anglicized version of Rousseau's original. See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Julia: or, The New Eloisa, trans. William Kenrick, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, 1773). But this revised edi tion never captured the popular imagination in the same way, and it was the earlier Eloisa text that continued to be reprinted.

In addition, she reconfigures the triangle so that it is the male lover, Seymour, and not one of the female cousins, whose marital fidelity is tested. This rehabilitates sexual abstinence and emotional restraint as vital components of femininity. Whereas Rousseau had depicted his female pro tagonist's loyalties as divided between her husband and her lover, Williams reverses the novel's premise so that the passions that threaten to disrupt the marriage at the center of the novel belong to Seymour, not to Julia. Conse quently Julia's emotions remain under control throughout, and, in pointed contrast to Julie's, never endanger her virginity. By replacing the French protagonist's eroticized passions with de-eroticized affections, Williams seeks to improve and adorn Rousseau's heroine with "beauties peculiar to the English language."6 The central premise behind her reworking of the novel is that calm, feminine affections are a peculiarly British virtue, while crude and unruly passions are a peculiarly French vice.7 How Williams was to represent emotions in Julia was an issue of particu lar sensitivity since her reputation as a writer chiefly rested on her famed sensibility. The success of her Poems (1786) had established chaste, fragile emotions as her trademark.8 This is evidenced by the pretext of Words worth's early poem, the "Sonnet on Seeing Miss Helen Maria Williams Weep at a Tale of Distress" (1787), which documents the speaker's moral edification from reading Williams's poem. To ensure that her literary cre dentials remained unharmed through her transition from poet to novelist, Williams's first novel needed to capitalize on her reputation for cultivating her readers' emotions. On top of this, the notoriety of Rousseau's La Nou velle Heloise had also largely been generated by its controversial repre sentation of emotions. Reference to the novel operates as a byword for the all-consuming passions it portrays, and which it was seen by many to vindicate. Allusions to Rousseau perform this function in British writing throughout the late eighteenth century.9 For example, in Mary Wollstone 6. Much has been written about the representation of women in Rousseau's work. For a useful window on these discussions, see Linda Zerilli, Signifying Woman: Culture and Chaos in Rousseau, Burke, and Mill (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994).

The theologian and moral philosopher, Thomas Cogan, characterizes the difference be tween these two categories of the emotions: "the term passion . . . may with strict propriety, be used, and used exclusively, to represent the first feelings, the percussion as it were, of which the mind is conscious from some impulsive cause. . . . The . . . term affection . . . sup poses a more deliberate predilection and aversion." Thomas Cogan, A Philosophical Treatise on the Passions, 2nd ed. (London, 1802), 6-9. 8.

On read ing his effusive comments scribbled in the margins of the copy he lends her, her mental image of her fellow prisoner inadvertently metamorphoses into St. Preux, the bewitchingly familiar "ideal lover."10 Wollstonecraft uses this intertextual reference to Julie to explicate and exculpate the sud den evolution of Maria's urgent feelings for a stranger. Reference to Rous seau's novel can carry this hermeneutic weight because of the extraordinary effects it was alleged to have had on real readers. As Robert Darnton has shown, "going through Rousseau's Nouvelle Heloise mail, one is struck ev erywhere by the sound of sobbing. . . . Readers from all ranks of society and all corners of the Continent reacted in the same way."11 By the time Williams came to write Julia, La Nouvelle Heloise had become synonymous with violence of emotion—violence of the emotions both of the novel's protagonists and of its readers. In Britain, progressive thinkers like Wollstonecraft and Imlay (Maria and Darnford) applauded the novel's daring exoneration of unfettered passions. They credited such passions with the potential to emancipate both sexes, especially women, from restrictive prohibitions on the expression of sexu ality. For the very same reason, prominent thinkers at the other end of the political spectrum volubly condemned the extremity of the emotions the novel conveys, warning that political anarchy ensues when private emo tions run riot. Launching one of the most enduring invectives against the novel, Edmund Burke in a letter to the French National Assembly (1791) accuses Rousseau of directly inciting revolutionary agitation through the representation of lawless passions in La Nouvelle Heloise. With catastrophic effect, the novel, he claims, goaded the French people to: infuse into their youth an unfashioned, indelicate, sour, gloomy, fero cious medley of pedantry and lewdness; of metaphysical speculations, blended with the coarsest sensuality. Such is the general morality of the passions to be found in their famous philosopher, in his famous work of philosophic gallantry, the Nouvelle Eloise.12 Thomas Holcroft, vol. 4 of Anna St. lues: A Novel, 7 vols. (London, 1792), 151. For a sus tained analysis of the role Rousseau's novel plays in eighteenth-century debates about the emotions, see Ernst Cassirer, The Question of Rousseau, trans.

Such physicality eroticizes calm domestic life, banishing the "real affection" on which effective government must be founded. "Public affections," he insists, "begin ... in our families. No cold relation is a zealous citizen."13 Britain remains peaceful and stable, he sug gests, because British people accept that they must curtail their emotions. In particular, they understand that extra-marital sexual passion disrupts fa milial harmony, creating friction in the community at large. The people of France, however, exercise no such restraint due to the influence of a novel that (as he sees it) absolves extra-marital female sexuality. They "betray the most awful family trusts, and vitiate their female pupils,"14 precipitating a decline in moral standards that results in political turmoil (of which the revolution is proof). The virulent antagonism towards Rousseau's novel among late eighteenth-century British conservatives thus stems from the challenge its represented passions are seen to pose to British moral and po litical order—an order predicated on the sexual abstinence of women. To ensure the continued dominance of this order in Britain, such thinkers are determined not to let French passions gain entry.15 "We [do] not want French principles in public or private life," declaims the judge in The Wrongs of Woman, echoing Burke; "and, if women [are] allowed to plead their feelings, as an excuse or palliation of infidelity, it [is] opening up a flood-gate for immorality. What virtuous woman [thinks] of her feel ings?"16 By transposing Julie's violent, unconquerable passions into calm, regu lated affections, Helen Maria Williams hauls the emotions of Rousseau's protagonist firmly in line with this British, conservative moral agenda.17 But her rejection of the category of the passions does not merely alter the moral framework of the French novel. Since for Rousseau the expression of passion is primarily an aesthetic concern, it fundamentally transforms the book's artistic framework too. Rousseau, like his disciple Mary Hays, be 13.

By identifying the similarity between the constructions of femininity mounted in Burke's Reflections and in Williams's Julia, I do not mean to suggest that the two writers were directly influenced by one another; merely that their ideas both conform to an ideal that can be broadly identified as British conservative. Since the two texts were published within months of one another, any direct causal relationship is unlikely.</page><page sequence="6">150 LOUISE JOY lieves that to represent feelings in their native chaos is the very height of novelistic achievement. As he explains in his dialogic introduction to the novel, "Preface de Julie ou Entretien sur les Romans": Ce n'est que dans le monde qu'on apprend a parler avec energie. Premierement, parce qu'il faut toujours dire autrement et mieux que les autres, et puis que, force d'afFirmer a chaque instant ce qu'on ne croit pas, d'exprimer des sentiments qu'on n'a point, on cherche a donner a ce qu'on dit un tour persuasif qui supplee a la persuasion interieure. ... La passion, pleine d'elle-meme, s'exprime avec plus d'abondance que de force; elle ne songe meme pas a persuader; elle ne soupfonne pas qu'on puisse doubter elle. Quand elle dit que ce qu'elle sent, c'est moins pour l'exposer aux autres que pour se soulager. ... Si la force du sentiment ne nous frappe pas, sa verite nous touche; et c'est ainsi que le coeur sait parler au coeur. Mais ceux qui ne sentent rien, ceux qui n'ont que le jargon pare des passions, ne connaissent point ces sortes de beautes, et les meprisent.18 [It is only in the world that one learns to speak forcefully. First of all, because one must say everything differently and better than others would, and second, because being obliged at every moment to make assertions one doesn't believe, to express sentiments one does not feel, one attempts to give what one says a persuasive turn to make up for the lack of inner persuasion. . . . Passion, wrapped up in itself expresses itself with more profusion than power; it doesn't even try to persuade; it doesn't suspect that anyone could mistrust it. When it says what it feels, it does so less to explain it to others than to unburden itself. . . . The strength of the sentiment many not strike us, but its truth affects us, and that is how one heart can speak to another. But those who feel nothing, those who have only the fancy jargon of the passions, are un familiar with beauties of this kind and disdain them.19] In his defense of the representation of disorderly passions he is careful to distinguish between passions communicated with force and passions com municated with abundance. Forceful communication of passions, he ar gues, derives from an overexposure to the language ("le jargon") of urban culture ("le monde"), which creates a gap between passions as they are originally felt and passions as they are ultimately expressed.

Such expression of passions is of no particular interest for literature. It is the other type, diffuse communica tion of passions, whose literary value Rousseau asserts. This second mode of expression, he argues, is morally striking in its artlessness and aestheti cally striking in its rarity, found only among those who are not enslaved by protocols of politeness (namely those who live outside the city). In La Nouvelle Helo'ise, Rousseau attempts to portray rural characters whose primary mode of communication is empathetic. While emotions communicated through language seek to explain themselves ("l'exposer aux autres"), emotions communicated empathetically ("cceur . . . au cceur") seek to unburden themselves ("se soulager"). By transmitting them wholesale, this mode of communication preserves the innate incoherence of the emotions, making them identical on the outside and the inside ("pleine d'elle-meme"). Because the passions he represents have not been organized into false orderliness by language, Rousseau anticipates that they will strike the reader with their truth ("verite"). They will be instantly rec ognizable and comprehensible, requiring no further interpretation. Indeed, by suggesting that such passions defy explanation, he repudiates rational in terrogation via language as a means of knowing them. His novel thus re fuses to offer guidance on how to respond to what is portrayed. The epis tolary form presents the characters in the process of presenting themselves. It denies the reader any meta-narrative that might help to shape our judg ments.20 This form enables Rousseau to capture the constant flux of the passions; to suggest that each new emotion displaces the previous emotion, and that there is no unifying force to impose order on the whole. There fore, though many early readers of the novel (Burke included) complain that La Nouvelle Helo'ise actively promotes the kinds of passions it repre sents, in fact Rousseau's own conception of his novel is as a text that is pre cisely without an instructive agenda: it requires us to make sense for our selves, without the assistance of authorial direction, of the material he puts before us. The literary principle he employs is thus expressive, not didactic. He seeks for his novel to reflect emotions that are already familiar to us.21 It is precisely this prospect that the reader might identify with Julie's 20. Jeanne Fuchs has argued that this does not mean that the emotions Rousseau depicts are any less subject to a controlling principle in their presentation, claiming that "close study of the letters reveals a tight structural order which parallels and mirrors the psychological fluctuations of Julie and the other characters."

Burke warns of the "se cret charm"22 of his writing and Hannah More of his "metaphysical soph istry the most plausible," declaring that there "never was a net of such ex quisite art and inextricable workmanship, spread to entangle innocence and ensnare inexperience."23 Adopting a similarly reactionary position, Helen Maria Williams explicitly refuses to accept that emotions that cannot be ex plained could possibly be virtuous. Reinstating the conventional rationalist line that Rousseau's novel had thrown out, the Advertisement of her own novel asserts the intrinsic alliance between disorderly passions and moral chaos: The purpose of these pages is to trace the danger arising from the uncontrouled indulgence of strong affections; not in those instances where they lead to the guilty excesses of passion in a corrupted mind— but, when disapproved by reason, and uncircumscribed by prudence, they involve even the virtuous in calamity; since, under the dominion of passion, if the horror may be avoided, misery at least is inevitable; and, though we do not become the slaves of vice, we must yield our selves the victims of sorrow.24 Her insistence that passions must be ordered by the coherent patterns of thought in language ("reason" and "prudence") undermines the very premise of Rousseau's novel. By replacing irrational passions with rational affections, she reintroduces moral intelligibility as the dominant criterion to be fulfilled by literary emotions. In so doing, she spurns the expressivist form so central to Rousseau's project and rewrites his novel as a roman a these.25 From the very outset, then, Williams emphasizes the moral threat ("vice," "misery") that she perceives disorderly passions to pose. Her use of anthropomorphism (to make them the "guilty," unstoppable subjects of her clauses) syntactically reenacts the power passions can wield over the reader, who is constructed as the object ("slav[e]," "victi[m]") of these clauses. While Rousseau views passion as morally neutral, and therefore 22. Burke, Letter, 34. 23. Hannah More, vol. 1 of Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education, 2 vols.

By countering her personification of passion with the personification of "reason" (who "approves") and "prudence" (who "circumscribes"), she accentuates the constructive role played by language in the elimination of passion. Rous seau had rejected the mediation language carries out on the grounds that any mediation threatens to distort the disorderliness of the passions. But, precisely for this reason, Williams welcomes the possibility that, by synthe sizing passions into a narrative, literary language regulates them. Williams thus grants language the capacity to constitute, or at least to alter, the emo tions it aspires to represent. By organizing emotions into language, she pro duces linguistic representations of organized emotions. In so doing, she ex punges the category of the passions (diffuse or otherwise) from her novel, so that the only emotions it contains are calm affections—emotions se curely under the thumb of reason. While Rousseau refrains from interpreting the emotions he presents, Williams seeks out this function: she aims to "trace" the "danger" they pose, guiding the reader towards the particular understanding her novel aims to facilitate.26 The additional presence of the narrator (implicitly an authorial alter ego) presents the characters' emotions as already filtered through thought. This recuperates the coherent linearity Rousseau's novel rejects, inscribing control into the very form of the novel. By mediating their presentation through the narrator's language, she ensures that the emotions not merely of the characters but also of the reader are delimited from the start: I think I see her at this moment; her chair drawn quite close to his, and her voice raised, because he heard with difficulty. I see the old man, placed in his crimson-damask chair, dressed in his long green gown, and white night-cap, listening to her with a sort of elevation in his look, and sometimes assenting to an affecting passage by the lifting up of his hands, and a movement of his lips in a short ejaculation. When . . . she saw him quite cheerful, she bid him good night, and re ceived a kiss, and a blessing. . . . The contemplation of a venerable old 26.

The narrator presents the scene as a feast for the faculty of sight (emphasized by the repetition of the verb "see.") Yet the watching that we are invited to participate in is not seeing in-time; the scene has been dredged up from the recesses of the narrator's memory ("I think I see her at this moment"). Thus, although the use of the present tense gives it a semblance of immediacy, it has already acquired the stability of a fixed recollection. Crystallized by the passing of time and neatly sculpted into coherent language, it is offered up as an account that bears only one interpretation. Its fixed nature renders the scene identifiable as a recognizable type, a type that Vivien Jones identifies as "sentimental,"28 but which might more productively be identified as affectionate. The semantic field of the affec tions, which yokes together the words "cheerful," "blessing" and "gently," structures the scene, marking it out as a site in which the optimistic and the deathly coincide: Julia's affection steers the old man calmly towards the af terlife. In presenting this familiar picture, Williams deploys overt, unam biguous symbolism to signify the internal states of her protagonists' minds. For example, the physical proximity between the characters indicates their emotional accord; his unassuming attire indicates his honesty; his elevated look towards his granddaughter indicates her moral superiority. The direct ness of the correlation between signifier and signified ensures that the reader cannot misinterpret: cannot fail to inherit the moral instruction en coded in the scene. But the reader's education does not depend solely on his or her ability to interpret these signs. The scene is also decoded for us by the narrator, who informs us that what we are witnessing is "filial affec tion," pinning down the emotions portrayed by labelling them with clear linguistic markers. Lest we are still in any doubt as to what our response to the scene should be, Williams closes it with a phrase that stipulates in un equivocal terms what feeling the sight before us should generate—"a seri ous yet not unpleasing sensation." 27.

Stephen Copley and John Whale (London and New York: Routledge, 1992), 178.</page><page sequence="11">EMOTIONS IN TRANSLATION: HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS 155 Williams's representation of her characters' emotions thus dwells more on the activity involved in their interpretation than on the emotions them selves. Consequently, Julia's emotions are never passions but are always al ready affections. At the point of their communication to us they have been rationalized, ordered in language, made comprehensible. Even at the point in the novel when Julia's emotions are at their strongest, Williams presents them indirectly: Julia was conscious, that though [Seymour's] conduct gave him some claim to her esteem, esteem was a sentiment which it was dangerous to cherish, and that, on this subject, reflection was at cruel variance with repose; since, whenever the idea of Seymour recurred to her mind, she was imperceptibly led into a comparison between him and others; and the decision which her heart involuntarily made, was by no means conducive to its tranquillity. But, though she had not the merit of insensibility, the purity of her mind corrected the softness of her heart. Rectitude stood in the place of indifference; and, since she could not entirely controul her feelings, she disregarded them alto gether, and only studied, with a fervent desire of acting right, to regu late her conduct by the strictest propriety.29 Through the combination of free indirect discourse and omniscient third person narrative, Williams offers us what we are led to believe is a compre hensive analysis of the workings of Julia's internal feelings. These feelings, located in her "conscious mind" and her "heart," are figured as invisible to the outside eye, and therefore potentially different from the emotions she expresses. And yet, significantly, her emotions and feelings are exactly in tune. Her conscious mind, just like the image of it she presents to the out side world, is unconfused, her thoughts unfolding in an orderly chronol ogy. By equipping us with knowledge about Julia that is typically available only to the subject in question (her lack of "repose"), as well as with knowledge that not even Julia has herself (confirmation of the "purity" of her mind and "softness" of her heart), Williams gives the reader a uniquely privileged understanding of her protagonist's moral probity. We are given insight gathered objectively (from her emotions as they appear to the out side world) as well as subjectively (from her feelings as they appear to her). And yet the scope of our viewpoint is an illusion. We are never given the opportunity to glimpse Julia's emotions and feelings unfolding in real time. We can form no sense of them that circumnavigates how they are packaged for us. We are thus unable to arrive at any analysis of Julia that deviates from the analysis already formed by the narrator. 29. Williams, vol. 2 of Julia, 2-3.</page><page sequence="12">156 LOUISE JOY Like Julia, who marshals her embryonic passions by "regulating her con duct with the strictest propriety," Williams regulates her representation of these emotions so that the watertight version she presents secures the reader's "purity of mind. "Just as Julia's strategy when she is unable fully to "controul her feelings" is to disregard them altogether, at key moments in the novel where the plot demands that passions do arise (they are never Julia's), Williams recoils from their immediate representation. For example, when Seymour seeks to express his passion for Julia (which must feature in the novel to highlight the superiority ofjulia's affection), Williams presents his passion in direct speech, one of the few occasions where she deploys this technique. But the scene is curtailed sharply as soon as sufficient pas sion has been displayed to throw into relief Julia's restraint (which is the novel's real interest): "Why does Werter [sic] interest us? Because he is not a phoenix of ro mance, but has the feelings and infirmities of man. He is subject to the power of passion—let those who never felt its influence, condemn him; those who have felt its influence, too well know that it is abso lute, that it is unconquerable. The heart that is bleeding with an incur able wound, needs not the cold counsels of reason, to be informed that such feelings are painful, and ought to be subdued. It is already but too sensible, that its misery is irretrievable, that it mocks the vain efforts of prudence; and that, if peace depends upon indifference, it is a good which is unattainable, which can never" "I must interrupt you," said Julia, in a faltering voice, "for I cannot stay any longer." He did not attempt to detain her, but rose in great agitation to open the door, and she hurried away. She met Mr Clifford in the hall.30 Even Seymour's declaration of passion for Julia, though unmistakable as such, is represented indirectly. His reference to Johann Goethe's The Sor rows of Young Werther: a German Story (1774) acts as a cipher for the irrepressibility of his unrequited love. By disclosing the fervor of Seymour's passions via this allusion to Werther's, Williams avoids having her male protagonist confess in outright terms his forbidden desire. She thereby di minishes the extent to which her representation of his illicit passion com promises either the reader or herself. Indeed, the reference seeks actively to protect the reader's modesty by functioning as a covert reminder of the dangers of literary passions. Like Rousseau's La Nouvelle Helo'ise, in the sec ond half of the eighteenth century, Goethe's novel was legendary on ac count of the emotions it represented and stimulated. Famously, it incited a spate of suicides across Europe as readers who identified with the protago 30. Williams, vol. 2 of Julia, 203-4.</page><page sequence="13">EMOTIONS IN TRANSLATION: HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS 157 nist's plight imitated his desperate solution.31 In this climate, to raise the specter of the German novel is to issue a clear warning about the perils of close contact with novelistic passions. In the very act of gesturing towards the extremity of Seymour's passions, then, Williams cautions her reader against identifying with them. This gesture succinctly reinforces her case for the advantages of didactic literature (like her own), which fosters the reader's affections, ensuring moral order. By the same token, it subtly un dermines the case for expressive literature (like Goethe's or Rousseau's), which unleashes the reader's passions and wreaks moral havoc. The threat that Seymour poses (both to Julia and, indirectly, to the reader) is indeed acute, since his words challenge the very foundations of the moral order Williams's novel recommends. In putting forward Rous seau's (or here, Goethe's) argument that passions cannot be comprehended rationally, Seymour makes it impossible for Julia (the spokesperson for Wil liams's counter-argument) to retaliate. She cannot engage with his argu ment through language, as to do so would be to deliver the very "cold counsels of reason" whose usefulness he denies. Julia's artillery, so success ful in quashing her own passions, is powerless to quell his. But although she cannot actively subdue his passions, she can nonetheless deflect them if she simply refuses to remain in their presence. She thus leaves the room while his passions are mid-flow, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with what he says: simply refusing to acknowledge it. Directly replicating this process, the narrative follows Julia out of the room. The focus moves on to Julia's subsequent conversation with Mr Clifford, leaving behind any interest in the passions it had briefly brought to life. The reader is denied any further access to Seymour's suffering. Mimicking Julia, Williams mitigates the im pact of Seymour's passions on the reader by simply disregarding them. When Williams does come close to representing passions, then, the pas sions she depicts belong to a male. In effect, she genders passions mascu line. This means that, in her attempt to avoid representing the passions, Williams marginalizes the novel's male characters. In Rousseau's novel, Julie and St. Preux, whose emotions are on a par, are presented as of equal interest; but in Julia, the male lover, whose emotions are morally inferior to Julia's, plays only a small, supporting role. This redistribution of emotions along gendered lines reintroduces the notion that passions are inconsistent with feminine respectability, which Rousseau, to Burke's dismay, had vio lently thrown out. By adhering to the notion that women must aspire to wards the affections, even while representing men as incapable of reining in 31.

The affections they achieve are so morally laudable that they inspire the impas sioned admiration of men. The more women attain mastery over their own affections, the more vulnerable to male passions they become. Williams's novel thus proposes that the only way for women to attain the feminine af fections recommended by Burke and others is through the elimination of men.32 The harmonious, affectionate community that comes into being in the last pages of the novel is only made possible when Seymour and Mr Meynell have been killed off and the women's affections, once jeopardized by the ungovernable passions of the men around them, are made secure. The comprehensive rejection of male passions that takes place in and through Julia has led Neil Fraistat and Susan Lanser to read the novel's di dactic character as "feminist."33 But although the novel does indeed make a case for female solidarity and self-sufficiency, the society that the women establish at the end carries with it a sense of loss, not gain. Williams's com mitment to a conservative model of femininity that prohibits the expres sion of passion produces a scenario of "perfect friendship" that entails a to tal annihilation of the erotic. Through the eradication of sexuality, procreation is thwarted, and the community has no way to perpetuate it self. Thus the very values underpinning the feminine affections Williams recommends render inevitable their own extinction. Her vision of an all female asylum for the affections is not so much a preemptive celebration of a scenario in which women triumph over men's passions, but a preemptive lament for a scenario in which they must withdraw from the sexual arena. Although the loss that this involves is never explicitly acknowledged, it is registered in the note of pathos on which the novel ends: Women have even greater reason than men to fortify their hearts against those strong affections, which, when not regulated by discre tion, plunge in aggravated misery that sex, who, to use the words of an elegant and amiable writer, 'cannot plunge into business, or dissi pate themselves in pleasure and riot, as men too often do, when under the pressure of misfortunes; but must bear their sorrows in silence, 32. My reading of Julia thus challenges Matthew Bray's account of the position Williams adopts in Letters Written in France. He claims that she "does not so much propose a meritoc racy as ... a 'sensocracy': a society predicated upon an equality of feeling among all people." As he rightly points out, though, despite "her appropriation of the realm of emotion as a ground upon which both sexes can have equal footing, Williams also ends up affirming sepa rate male and female spheres, an affirmation that mirrors Burke's depiction of women's roles in Reflections to an uncanny extent."

Her turn to quotation at this point—the effective disappearance of the moralizing narratorial voice—suggests her inability to account in her own words for the empti ness she has laid bare. The disintegration of the category of the affections as an intact, viable ideal thus coincides with the degeneration of the didactic mode. Williams cannot entertain the conceivable unviability, the potential undesirability, of the affections she seeks to recommend from within the confines of the roman a these form. Just months after the publication of Julia, Helen Maria Williams emi grated to France, where she was on site to observe firsthand the aftermath of the revolution. From 1790, when she published Letters Written in France, until 1827, the year of her death, she regularly sent back to Britain eyewit ness accounts of the political developments in France as she experienced them, carving out a niche for herself within the conventionally male arena of political reportage. While the Letters Written in France by and large re ceived relatively favorable reviews, contemporary responses consistently expressed disquiet about the suitability of this mode of writing for a female author. Encapsulating this anxiety, the reviewer for The Gentleman's Maga zine proclaims that Williams's incursion into the field of foreign correspon dence "debasefs] her sex, her heart, her feelings, her talents."35 Central to the reviewer's objection is the assumption that observational journalism compels a woman to take on types of emotions that more properly belong in the male domain.36 Indeed, Williams's own reports of what it was like to live and write in France during this time also focus on the unfamiliar emotions (passions) to which her experiences in France expose her, a development that she too configures as a disruption of gendered stereotypes. This anxiety about how her occupation as a writer has regendered her emotions is vividly played out in her translation of Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's best seller, Paul et Virginie (1787). Williams undertook this translation during her 34- Williams, vol. 2 of Julia, 238-39. 35. Anon, Gentleman's Magazine (January 1795): 1030. 36. By the same token, as Deborah Kennedy has shown, Williams's foreign correspon dence also serves to feminize the field of history writing.

Due to the timely intervention of a friend, she was let out after six weeks. But as a relatively prominent writer, and moreover a British citizen living in France while the two countries were at war, the danger she faced was acute; although she and the rest of her family escaped execution, a number of their close friends did not. Her Preface to Paul and Virginia (penned after her release) characterizes this phase of her life chiefly by way of the turbulent emotions with which she associates it: Amidst the horrors of Robespierre's tyranny . . . and amidst the min ute vexations of Jacobinical despotism . . . the resources of writing, and even reading, were encompassed with danger. The researches of domiciliary visits had already compelled me to commit to the flames a manuscript volume, where I had traced the political scenes of which I had been a witness . . . and since my pen, accustomed to follow the impulse of my feelings, could only have drawn, at that fatal period, those images of desolation and despair which haunted my imagination, and dwelt upon my heart, writing was forbidden employment. ... In this situation ... I found the most soothing relief in wandering from my own gloomy reflections to those enchanting scenes of. . . Mauri tius, which he has so admirably described. . . . The public will, per haps, receive with indulgence a work written under such peculiar cir cumstances; not composed in the calm of literary leisure, or in pursuit of literary fame, but amidst the turbulence of the most cruel sensa tions, and in order to escape awhile from overwhelming misery.37 The reference to Robespierre, whose famously merciless revolutionary zeal she holds accountable for her imprisonment, genders the "turbulen[t]" pas sions associated with his regime as male. By representing herself as shackled to these "cruel sensations," Williams suggests that the revolution has com pelled her to take on passions of "desolation and despair," already implicitly male through their tacit evocation of the notorious melancholic suffering of Werther and St. Preux (and, less notoriously, her own protagonist, Sey mour). Like the reviewer of The Gentleman's Magazine, she depicts her subjugation to male passions "at that fatal period" as tied to the activity of writing about these horrors. But she represents the chain of development not as an option she has chosen, but as a double-bind that entraps her. She is imprisoned by male passions because she writes; and she writes because she is imprisoned by male passions. Like her reviewer, she perceives that as a direct consequence of her role as political chronicler, she takes on emo 37- Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Paul and Virginia, trans. Helen Maria Wil liams (London, 1795), iii-xii.</page><page sequence="17">EMOTIONS IN TRANSLATION: HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS 161 tions that cannot be characterized as feminine. Given the dilemma this presents, it is unsurprising that in her Preface she makes no reference at all to her gender. In effect, by staging herself as a female writer who takes on male emotions through the act of writing about them, she ungenders her authorial persona. Just three years after the publication of Julia, then, Williams poignantly portrays herself as alienated from the very affections she had asserted as so central to exemplary femininity. In this predicament, she retrospectively depicts herself as having embarked on the task of translating Saint-Pierre's "soothing" novella for therapeutic purposes, hoping that the act of render ing the affections of the French novel into her own language would serve, if not to regulate, then at least temporarily to assuage the male passions that consume her in prison. Paul et Virginie, Saint-Pierre's sentimental novella about the affections of a group of French exiles in Mauritius, had originally been conceived as a fictional epilogue to Etudes de la Nature (1784), his lengthy investigation into Rousseauvian primitivism. The appended tale so delighted its readership, however, that it was soon reproduced as a discrete work that far outsold the original treatise and became an instant classic in France.38 While the explicit purpose of her first prose venture had been to culti vate the reader's affections, this work seeks to cultivate its author's. Where the Preface of Julia had emphasized Williams's position of authority over the reader (implicitly derived from her own privileged access to the affec tions), the Preface of Paul and Virginia emphasizes her dependence on the reader (a dependence created by her alienation from the affections). She di rectly appeals to the reader, requesting that her current inability to control her passions shapes our experience of reading the novel. By planting her own grieving presence squarely in the novel's main frame, she thus jetti sons the literary principle of her previous didactic novel, abandoning the attempt to reform the emotions of others, and uses the novel form as a ve hicle instead to reform her own. She transforms the literary caste of Saint Pierre's original, turning his gently moralizing sentimental fable into a troubled confession of her own suffering. She inserts into Saint-Pierre's text the very passions she yearns to leave behind; in her very attempt to re cover them, she punctures the affections to which she aspires. Since the category of the passions is typically aligned with the male sphere, and the affections with the female, Williams's alteration of the cate gories of emotion represented in the novel overhauls its gender dynamics. 38. For a discussion of the stellar success of Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie, see David Menhennet, "International Bestseller: Paul and Virginia by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre," The Book Collector 38 (1989): 483-502.</page><page sequence="18">162 LOUISE JOY If we accept the terms of the Preface, then the spectral presence of the novel's impassioned female author affects how we respond to the story's nar rator. He, too, is a solitary, impassioned writer seeking respite from suffering through the act of transcribing the affections from which he is alienated. But he is also, significantly, male. From the novel's opening, the narrator weaves himself into the fabric of the tale, representing himself as a peripheral charac ter who discreetly watches and listens at the edge of the scene: Within this enclosure reigns the most profound silence. ... To this scene I loved to resort, where I might enjoy at once the richness of the extensive landscape, and the charm of uninterrupted solitude. One day, when I was seated at the foot of the cottages, and contemplating their ruins, a man, advanced in years, passed near the spot. . . . 'Father, can you tell me to whom those cottages once belonged?' 'My son,' re plied the old man. . . . 'Their history is affecting; but what European, pursuing his way to the Indies, will pause one moment to interest himself in the fate of a few obscure individuals? What European can picture happiness to his imagination amidst poverty and neglect?' . . . 'Father,' I rejoined, 'if you have leisure, relate to me, I beseech you, the history of the ancient inhabitants of this desert; and be assured, that even the men who are most perverted by the prejudices of the world, find a soothing pleasure in contemplating that happiness which be longs to simplicity and virtue.'39 The narrator is thus a European traveler who gains vicarious delight ("soothing pleasure") from reflecting on "the happiness which belongs to simplicity and virtue," which by implication is otherwise unavailable to him. Like Williams, since he is unable to participate in the scene at hand, he contributes by recording his observations and passing them on to others (presumably an audience back in Europe). In Williams's translation of the novel, then, there is a clear parallelism between the tale's narrator and her self. Moreover, to those familiar with the life and work of Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the voice of this male narrator raises another spectral presence—that of its original French author. Saint-Pierre had vis ited Mauritius in 1768 and published an account of his travels there, Voyage a l'Ile-de-France, in 1773.40 Saint-Pierre's own 1788 Preface to Paul et 39- Paul and Virginia, trans. Williams, 3-5. 40. The resemblance between the narrators of Voyage a l'Ile-de-France and Paul et Virginie is reinforced by the similarity in the thematic interests and the prose styles of the two works. For example, in the non-fictional account, Saint-Pierre writes: "the solitude of the place, the murmuring noise of the sea, all combined to present to my imagination, a picture of those times when the children of Noah, descended upon a new earth, began afresh to partake of the domestic enjoyments they had so long been stranger to." Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, A Voyage to the Island of Mauritius, trans. John Parish (London, 1775), 154.</page><page sequence="19">EMOTIONS IN TRANSLATION: HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS 163 Virginie reinforces this identification between himself and his narrator by reminding the reader of his firsthand knowledge of life in Mauritius: "je puis assurer que celles dont je vais parler ont vraiment existe" ["I can assure the reader that those I speak of did really exist"], adding that even the finer details of the story are drawn from his own "personal experience" ["m'etant personnelles"].41 The novel then introduces a further narrator, another solitary, French male reminiscent of Saint-Pierre himself. This second narrator is distin guished from the first solely by his seniority. The common gender of these three narratorial presences establishes a strong suggestion that the role of onlooker—a solitary passer-by who is affected by and describes the com munity of affections to others, but is not otherwise involved in it—is essen tially a male one. The mode of address adopted by the two characters, who call each other "Father" and "Son," emphasizes the peculiarly male kinship that arises through the similarity of their roles, a similarity that they both intuit. The similarities between them make possible an instant affinity, which is automatically comprehensible to them both as based on a bond of inheritance whereby the older man passes on his wisdom (the narrative) to a younger man in his own image. Since he will not be around to witness the returns of this transaction, the relationship is defined in terms of what one gives to the other, and not in terms of what they both together be come. Indeed, they remain markedly detached from one another through out, and depart to go their separate solitary ways as soon as the narrative has been passed on. By representing the transmission of the narrative as passed down the male line in this way, Saint-Pierre's novel characterizes the role of narrator as indelibly tied to the male domain. Indeed, the very possibility of a male domain comes into being only through the process of this ex change: the men come together at the site of the ruined female affections and forge a common identity for themselves founded on their mutual de sire to be distracted from their passions through the handing down of the affections in narrative form. However, in Williams's reworking of the novel, the additional spectral presence of the translator herself forestalls the male gendering of the passing on of narrative. It inserts a female presence into the line of narrators, whose roles are identical to the role she outlines for herself in her Preface. By aligning herself with these French male narrators, the British authoress thus disrupts the notion central to the Saint-Pierre novel that to be excluded from the domain of affections is a distinctively male plight. The fact that she seeks to access the affections through the same channels as these male writers, and yet is not herself male, complicates Saint-Pierre's gendered dis 41. Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Paul et Virginie (Paris: Gamier Freres, 1958), cxlv-vi.</page><page sequence="20">164 LOUISE JOY tribution of emotions (affections as female, passions as male)—the very pat tern that her own earlier work had so concertedly upheld. The centrality of the role played by literary authorship in dismantling the conventional organization of the interrelationship between emotions and gender in Williams's translation is reflected in the most striking of the changes she makes to the French text: the interpolation of a selection of sonnets into the main body of the novel. These sonnets, which her Preface identifies as her "last poetical productions,"42 are seamlessly interwoven into the text and attributed to the character Madame de la Tour. This dra matically alters the role played by the novel's female protagonist. It means that, while in the French version, what marks her out from the others in her family is her ability to read, in the Williams version, it is her ability to write, and hence her ability to communicate the fact of this difference. Gary Kelly has suggested that the sonnets "render more lyrical an already lyrical text." But far from enhancing the lyrical tenor of Saint-Pierre's novel, the insertion of the sonnets in fact helps to shatter it.43 This is clearly illustrated in the first sonnet, which fractures the cohesiveness both of and in Saint-Pierre's description of the bucolic domestic arrangements of the two exiled women. The section in italics beneath indicates the new mate rial that Williams inserts into the middle of a passage that runs continuously in the Saint-Pierre original: They found in their retreat neatness, independence, all those blessings which are the recompense of toil, and received those services which have their source in affection.—United by the tie of similar wants, and the sympathy of similar misfortunes, they gave each other the tender names of companion, friend, sister.—They had but one will, one in terest, one table. All their possessions were in common. And if some times a passion more ardent than friendship awakened in their hearts the pang of unavailing anguish, a pure religion, united with chaste manners, drew their affections towards another life; as the trembling flame rises towards heaven, when it no longer finds any aliment on earth. Madame de la Tour sometimes, leaving the household cares to Margaret, wandered out alone. . . . Sometimes she poured forth effusions of melancholy in the language of verse; and, although her compositions have little poetical merit, they appear to me to bear the marks of genuine sensibility. . . . : 42.

The tender and sacred duties which nature imposed, became a source of additional happiness to those affectionate mothers, whose mutual friendship acquired new strength at the sight of their children . . . and sometimes changed the maternal bosom at which they received nour ishment, as if to blend with the ties of friendship that instinctive affec tion which this act produces.44 As Saint-Pierre explicitly indicates, this is a household whose "source" is in "affection." Like the all-female enclave of affections represented at the end of Julia, the household created by Madame de la Tour and Margaret is founded on their likeness ("similar wants"), a resemblance that is born of their mutual suffering ("misfortunes"). Again, as in Julia, the women are here brought together over the shared labor ("toil") of rearing their chil dren. Significantly, this work takes place in the absence of men. As in Julia, then, their home offers no outlet for the erotic, an element which Saint Pierre emphasizes in his description of the women's manners as "pure" and "chaste." Any emotions that threaten to evolve into passions are channeled into religious worship, as the women "dr[a]w their affections towards an other life." This scene, like so many other literary sites of affection, is tilted towards its own extinction; the affections that secure its perpetuation are impulses that embrace death. In stark contrast to the relationship depicted between the male narrators, the relationship between these women is portrayed as one of equality and sharing. They address one another as "companion," "friend," and "sister," suggesting the parity of their positions and the ensuing harmony and coop eration that exists between them. Likewise, the tie between Paul and Vir ginia is represented as sibling attachment, which forecloses the expression of sexuality in their relationship.45 Saint-Pierre stresses the equality made possible by this two-mother family through his representation of the infants sharing their mothers' milk, a gesture that accentuates the fact that the to 44- Paul and Virginia, trans.

By virtue of their physical re dundancy in the process of nursing, men are defunct in this scene. Incapa ble of participating in the passing-on of affection, the adult (that is, sexual ized) men in the novel are pushed to the margins, compelled to pass on narratives about the affections instead.46 Williams's insertion of the additional passage into this feminized pastoral slashes the scene down the middle, bringing back to center stage the pas sions that Saint-Pierre's text had relegated, along with the male characters, to the wings.47 Crucially, this reintroduction of passion coincides with— and occurs because of-—Madame de la Tour's act of writing. Her compul sion to write physically removes her from the domestic fold, distancing her from the affections within it. In her solitude, her passions break out and are channeled into the written form of the sonnet. Like the chain of writers al ready inscribed in Williams's translation, she adopts a lyrical, first-person voice that mournfully evokes the isolation of her plight. The sonnet is thus an unmediated expression of passion, its mode reminiscent of that used by Rousseau in La Nouvelle Helo'ise. The opening apostrophe, "Ah, Love!" marks an eruption that defies rational explanation: the words carry no in trinsic sense, operating merely to communicate the disorderliness of the protagonist's mind. Indeed, as she affirms, in pouring out this emotion, she "asks no rest"; she does not undertake the act of writing with a restorative purpose in mind, but to give voice to—temporarily to ofHoad—her roam ing passions. By describing her bosom as "bleeding," she figures writing as a painful, an unstoppable, potentially even a fatal, seeping out of what un der normal conditions would remain unseen. Like bleeding, the act of writing "cherishes despair": the external eruption of the passions, which exposes (if only to herself) her utter inability to impede them, exacerbates the melancholia that gives rise to them in the first place. Madame de la Tour's attempt to retrieve the affections through writing is thus self defeating; her desperate retreat into literature simply aggravates the prob lem from which she tries to escape. 46. By implication, the slave, Domingo, who resides inside the enclave of affections, is not treated as a sexualized male. His color renders him faceless, and therefore his presence—in as much as it is registered at all—is not registered as a male presence. For a fascinating discussion of why Saint-Pierre's novel renders slavery effectively invisible, see Anna Neill, "The Senti mental Novel and the Republican Imaginary: Slavery in Paul and Virginia," Diacritics 23 (1993): 36-47. 47.

The protagonist's subjugation to passions in Mauritius thus echoes the translator's subjugation to passions in Paris; and by the same token, the translator's anguished cries echo those of Saint-Pierre's protagonist. In this way, Madame de la Tour's failure to dissipate her passions through her writing encourages us to read Williams's attempt to alleviate her suffering through the act of writing Paul and Virginia as similarly abortive. By making Madame de la Tour a writer— a writer, moreover, whose craft fails her—Williams steeps the novel in a self-reflexive melancholy that the original keeps at bay. However, while Madame de la Tour's writing fails to supply her with the solace she seeks, it is not completely redundant: there is in fact a beneficiary. The male hermit, the second narrator, reads her literary efforts and is struck by their "genuine sensibility." In the French text, these two characters are always close, and Madame de la Tour turns to the older male for practical assistance and moral support. Williams's interpolation of the sonnets into Saint-Pierre's text restructures this friendship as a relationship between reader and writer. This reconfigures the gift dynamics at play. While in the Saint-Pierre novel, it is the hermit who helps Madame de la Tour, in the Williams ver sion, the female protagonist repays this gift through the act of writing. Therefore although they do not relieve her passions, Madame de la Tour's sonnets do nonetheless fulfill a hidden function. By transmitting her pas sions, they speak to the male hermit, and through their similarity to his own (their seeming authenticity), these passions confirm him in his knowl edge of his own. Her expressive writing thus opens up a new channel of communication about the emotions that transcends gendered boundaries. Through writing about her alienation from the affections, Madame de la Tour (Williams) establishes a meeting place—albeit virtual—for the trans mission of suffering. By turning Saint-Pierre's protagonist into a female writer, Williams makes her both familiar with, but alienated from, feminine affections and familiar with, but alienated from, masculine passions. She thus equips her with the capacity of giving voice to emotions that have res onance for both sexes. In its reordering of the categories of the emotions, Williams's translation of Saint-Pierre's novel explores how literary writing can reorder categories of gender. It opens up a space in which it is possible to fathom emotions as gender-neutral: as windows onto suffering and alienation shared by both sexes. The haunting presence of the imprisoned Williams, full of "desola tion and despair," adds the tears of an agonized woman to the tears of the agonized men that close Saint-Pierre's novel:</page><page sequence="24">168 LOUISE JOY "As for myself, since I behold you no more, I am like a father bereft of his children, like a traveller who wanders over the earth, desolate and alone."

Though perma nently calm emotions might be available to neither sex, transmitting the ideal in written form is available to both. While to do so can repair neither the writer's nor the reader's affections, it can at least provide the knowl edge that in our ongoing alienation from them, but our continued hope of their attainment, we are not alone.
