ROBINSON, Editor Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore NECROLOGY Sir A. E. Wallis Budge, who from 1893 to 1924 was Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian De- partment of the British Museum, died on No- vember Q3, 1934 at the age of 77. He conducted excavations at Aswan in Egypt and at sites in the Shdan; at Nineveh and Der in Mesopotamia. He was a prolific writer and published many books on Assyrian and Egyptian history and texts. Edouard Cuq, renowned scholar of law in all periods of antiquity from Hammurabi to Justinian, died in May, 1934. In 1876 he was accepted in the examination for a fellowship in law and was sent two years later as a fellow to the Ecole franCaise de Rome. While professor of Roman law at Bordeaux he was called to Paris in 1893 to teach, and in 1898 the faculty of law gave to him the newly created chair of Roman law which he occupied until his retirement. From 1911 1 The department of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books is conducted by Professor DAVID M.

WEST, Professor FRED V. WINNETT, and the Editors. For an explanation of the abbreviations see Vol. xxiv, 1, p. 124, and Vol. xxix, 1, pp. 115-116. he was a member of the Acad6mie des Inscrip- tions et Belles-Lettres. Cuq's teaching resulted in the excellent book: Histoire des institutions juridiques des Romains, of which the first edition is entitled, Les Institutions juridiques des Romains envisagees dans leurs rapports avec l'etat 3ocial et les progres de la juris- prudence. He made an intensive study of Le Colonat partiaire dans l'Afrique by means of African epigraphic texts. From French discoveries he borrowed his material for his Etude sur le droit babylonien, les lois assyriens et les lois hittites. At the time of his death Cuq was still at work on a juridical commentary to Cicero's orations. It is to Cuq that we owe the volume of Borghesi on the prefects of the praetorium and the articles Ius and Lex in the Dictionnaire des Antiquites grecques et romaines. Among his better known writings are Les Conseils des Empereurs d'Auguste a Diocletien and De la nature des crimes imputes aux chretiens d'apres Tacite. Dr. L. R. Farnell, rector of Exeter College, Oxford, from 1914 to 1928, died March 28, 1934. He was one of the principal English scholars of classical archaeology. His many travels in Greece and Asia Minor prepared him for his studies in the artistic and literary manifestations of the ancient Mediterranean civilization. In 1932 he brought out his edition and translation of Pindar. Greek religion and its evolution had for a long time been the object of his study. His basic work appeared from 1896 to 1909 and consisted of five volumes on The Cults of the Greek States, to which he added a supplement entitled Hero Cults. On the same subject he wrote certain less technical works such as: The Higher Aspects of Greek Religion (1914), The Outline of the History of Greek Religion, and the public lecture series (1911), entitled Ilellenic Religion. His work in the religion of Greece brought him to a study of general religion which resulted in his two works- 118</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 119 The Evolution of Religion and The Attributes of God. Simos Menardos, rector of the Academy of Athens in 1930, whose great work in archaeology was his activity in the establishment of the archaeological museum in Cyprus, died in 1933. Menardos was a specialist in Cyprian philology and dialectology, both medieval and modern. In addition to linguistic studies, he has left works on place-names and folklore, principally of Cyprus, but also including Lesbos, Rhodes and outlying districts. Corrado Ricci, who will be remembered in connection with the reconstruction of the im- perial forum, died in Rome, June 6, 1934. He was a critic and historian of art and an archaeol- ogist. His official capacities were those of curator of the art galleries of Parma and Modena, super- intendent of the monuments of Ravenna, director of the museums of Milan and Florence, and director-general of the Beaux-Arts from 1906 to 1916. Since 1911, he had studied the project of clearing the imperial fora, and when the new regime authorized it he worked intensively at this task. To this aspect of his work he devoted his entire literary activity for ten years. Ricci was a senator of the realm of Italy, a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and correspondent of the Institut de France. GENERAL The Oriental Origin of Typhon.- According to Homer, II. ii, 783, Typhon was 'v 'ApIots, which means among the Aramaeans. According to Apollodoros, who copies an epic of the seventh century, the battle between Typhon and Zeus began on the Syrian mountain Kasios. This was Aramaean territory and the centre of the cult of Baal Zaphon. In one of Assurnasirpal's reliefs, Marduk is armed like Zeus in Apollodoros; and his foe, Tiamat, corresponds to Typhon and also to a monster described in Daniel 7, 4. (F. DoRN- SEIFF, Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 154-157.) Use of Gold in Paintings and Reliefs. -In the Archaeologiai Ertesit6i, xlvi, pp. 5-36, J6ZSEF BODONYI studies the use of gold in late antique paintings and reliefs. He shows that the question can be considered psychologically because of the brilliancy and gleam of gold. When we consider its use in ally work of art, we must decide whether it is used as a mere filler to express the feeling of light in a space which is regarded as intermediary between other spaces or whether it is used as a means of emphasizing the reality of the objects between which it is found. Finally it becomes a symbol of the contrast between heaven and earth. THE ORIENT ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA Uruk.- A lecture by E. HEINRICH on Uruk- Warka is summarized in Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 710-715. Numerous building levels fall into a much smaller number of culture periods. In the earliest, "Obeid," period the bricks resemble modern ones in form and arrangement. In the following " Uruk" period the bricks are very long and are laid as "headers"; this continues through the "Jemdet Nasr" period. Thereafter a new form, piano-convex, appears, and a new arrange- ment, in which flat courses alternate with courses in which the bricks stand on edge with the nar- rowest face visible. To this period the first dynasty of Ur belongs. The same arrangement is found in the second half of the third millennium, after the disappearance of the plano-convex shape. Ziggurat at Babylon.- G. MARTINY discusses the original form of this tower and publishes sketches of six restorations (Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 743-747). His own is based on a new interpreta- tion of the dimensions in the Hellenistic tablet and on study of the ruins. The sixth stage is the temple; the seventh, very small, contained the sahurti. A fuller publication (Architectura, i, 1933, pp. 217 ff.) is mentioned. PERSIA Prehistoric Pottery from Persia.- In The Il- lustrated London News, December 15, 1934, p. 1005, there is a brief report by MR. ARTHUR UPHAM POPE, Adviser in Art to the Persian Gov- ernment, about the pottery recently found by natives at Syalck, near Kashan in Central Persia. The commonest shape is a graceful jug with a long open spout, some in a polished gray ware, others with designs in red on a buff ground. Both geometric motives and animal representa- tions were employed. The date is still a problem. Some authorities consider the pottery to be con- temporary with the Luristan Bronzes. The closest parallels are to be found in the Hittite pottery from Alishar Huyuk in Anatolia, which dates in the middle of the second millennium. Excavations are now being carried on at Syalck by a Louvre expedition under the direction of Dr. G. Con- tenau.</page><page sequence="3">120 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY SYRIA AND PALESTINE Prehistoric Remains. - The remains of an extinct species of elephant have recently been dis- covered in the course of digging a well at Bethle- hem. This is the first instance of such a find in Palestine. (Palestine Exploration Fund, October, 1934.) The Arabah.-DR. NELSON GLUECK made an expedition to Edom and the Arabah. He finds abundant evidence of copper mining in the days of Solomon and suggests that Solomon's wealth was derived from these copper mines. Feinan is an important site, which was occupied from about 2200 to 1800 B.c. and after that not until the pe- riod extending between the thirteenth and eighth centuries. He extends these dates to the whole region. On the basis of these observations he decides that the Exodus must have been late, since he infers that the Edomites and the Moa- bites were not in this land until the thirteenth century. Canon W. J. Phythian-Adams is not convinced, but for the present holds that the date for the fall of Jericho as established by Garstang is the deciding factor for the date of the Exodus. (Palestine Exploration Fund, October, 1934.) Gerasa.-In The Illustrated London News, November 24, 1934, pp. 850-851, there is a brief discussion of the large hoard of terracotta figur- ines and lamps discovered at Jerash, ancient Gerasa, by excavators from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. Men working on a road discovered a small cave. It proved to have been used originally as a tomb, later as an oil-press, and finally as the storeroom of a potter's workshop, to judge from the objects found. Almost a hundred baskets of fragments were re- moved. They date from the first half of the second century A.D. to the end of the third century. All of the pieces show strong Greek influence, many of the terracottas being copies of well- known classical Greek statues of the fourth cen- tury and Hellenistic period. This find shows the high level of culture at Gerash and also indicates that the population was not entirely Semitic in character. Excavations at Tell ed-Duweir, 1933-1934.-- At Tell ed-Duweir traces of an early Copper Age have been found. The early Copper Age people lived in caves, but at a later date these caverns were used as burial places. In the large necropolis of the later Copper Age over 180 graves were discovered. A scarab of Amenhotep III with an inscription of eight lines of hieroglyphs was found; thus con- tacts with Egypt during the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty have been established. Of the greatest importance is the discovery of about forty fragments of a ewer ?2 feet in height, decorated with a series of goats, trees, a stag, a lion, and a bird. Above these figures on a level with the handle is an inscription in characters resembling those found at Serabit el Khadim in Sinai. This is the third example of this script found in South Palestine; one from Beth Shemesh was found by Dr. Grant and the other from Gezer, by the American School. J. L. Starkey suggests that this region was the home of the miners who wrote the inscriptions at Serabit. The inscription runs from left to right. The first word MTN, "gift," seems certain, but interpretations about the rest are not certain. The Quarterly Statement publishes in this number the interpretation by T. R. GASTER and also that by FATHER E. BUR- ROWS, S.J. (Palestine Exploration Fund, October, 1934.) Tepe Gawra. - In The Illustrated London News, December 9., 1934, there are two pages (1050-51) of pictures, showing some of the most interesting small finds from the last campaign at Tepe Gawra. The objects are described briefly by DR. CHARLES BACHE, Field-Director of the joint expedition of the Pennsylvania University Museum and the American Schools of Oriental Research. "The strata excavated in this campaign were the IXth and Xth from the top. Tentatively, they may be assigned to the Jemdet-Nasr period of early Meso- potamian civilization, the last pre-Dynastic cul- ture." The objects illustrated include terracotta and stone vases, gold ornaments, bone combs, and( a unique bowl with plastic figures of sheep, the nearest parallel to which is a plastic repre- sentation of a snake-worship ceremony which was found at Vouni, Cyprus, but is a thousand years later in date. Discovery of a Mithraeum at Dura-Europos. - In The Illustrated London News, December 8, 1934, pp. 963-965, DR. CLARK HOPKINS, Director of the Yale University Expedition to Dura-Euro- pos, in co6peration with the French Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, gives a brief preliminary report on the results of the seventh campaign. The most important discovery was a Mithraeum, which was found in a remarkably fine state of preservation owing to the fact that it had been covered and protected by the mud brick</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 121 ramparts built against the city wall during the Persian siege. The sanctuary is an actual building and not an underground grotto. It is similar in plan to those known in the west, but is consider- ably finer than any, even the one at Capua. It is primarily important in being the first discovered in Asia Minor or Syria, where the cult was born. The niche at the west end of the temple was al- most completely preserved. Seven steps lead up to a horned altar. In the centre of the rear wall of the niche behind the altar are two reliefs, dating from 168 and 170 A.D., with scenes of Mithra slaying the bull. Around the reliefs and on the side walls of the niche are frescoes of the third century with scenes depicting the life of Mithra, the signs of the zodiac and Mithra hunting wild beasts. A close connection with later Byzantine painting is apparent. Many inscriptions and graffiti were also recovered (cf. above, pp. 4-5, pls. IV-V). Palmyra.- A lecture by H. A. SEYRIG on the sanctuary of Bel at Palmyra is published, Arch. Arinz., 1933, pp. 715-742. The sanctuary is a colon- naded square, 200 m1. on a side; the temple stands in the centre on a podium. Arab houses and a mosque, which occupied the area before 1930, have all been removed. Three of the colonnades are double, the fourth higher and single. Before the temple was an altar 12 rm. square and a water- basin the same size. On the west was a propylaea and also a vaulted entrance, below the level of the colonnade, for sacrificial animals. An inscrip- tion states that the temple was dedicated to Bel, larhibol and Aglibol in A.D. 3~. Corinthian capi- tals indicate A.D. 50-150 for the court; it was be- gun at the northwest corner and the west colon- nade, with the propylaea, is the latest part. The sanctuary as a whole is of normal Syrian type, but not the temple. It is Corinthian, pseudo- dipteral, and gabled, and had the exterior ap- pearance of a Greek temple. The door is in the western long side, not in the centre, and at each end is an adyton reached by a stair; it seems, however, that the original plan was like that of a Greek temple, and Mesopotamian influence in the plan is improbable. Bel is probably not the Babylonian Bel, but a native Syrian god like the other members of the triad, whose original name was Bol. The southern adyton may have con- tained a ritual bed for the god; the northern, with a side room for ceremonial utensils, would contain the images. Here also were reliefs, depicting the gods of the days of the week and the signs of the zodiac. More noteworthy are the reliefs on the ceiling beams of the pteron, showing a great num- ber of divinities with votaries, altars, sacred trees, etc. Except for Herakles, they do not belong to the Graeco-Roman pantheon. In one scene a camel carries an empty tabernacle as symbol of an invisible god, a feature of many oriental cults. Chinese silk has been found at Palmyra. W. Zschietzschmann briefly expresses the opin- ion that the cella of the temple of Bel was hypae- thral (ibid. p. 743). ASIA MINOR Hissarlik and the Homeric Troy.-In L'anti- quite Classique, iii (fasc. 2), 1934, pp. 469-488, CHARLES VELLAY again assembles his arguments against the traditional identification of Hissarlik with the Homeric Troy. He maintains (1) that neither does the site of Hissarlik satisfy the topo- graphical requirements to be deduced from the poems of Homer nor (c2) does it agree with the location of Troy by the post-Homeric geogra- phers, and (3) that the physical characteristics of Hissarlik VI laid bare by the excavations of Schliemann, D6rpfeld, and more recently Blegen completely fail to correspond to the Homeric picture of Priam's city. He finds at the twin sites of Eski-Hissarlik and Bali-Dagh in the south- eastern corner of the lower Scamander plain his ideal claimants for the honor of identification with the Homeric Troy. The latter, particularly, he argues, satisfies (in the absence of excavation) better than any other site of the Mycenaean period in the Troad the Homeric requirements for the position and physical characteristics of the city, and in addition is most suitable to the loca- tion of the post-Homeric geographers. The prob- lem will be settled, if at all, by more extensive excavation in the Troad. CYPRUS Recent Excavations in Cyprus.-In The Illus- trated London News, January 19, 1935, pp. 97-99, 110, there is a brief report by P. DIKAIOS, Curator of the Cyprus Museum, of archaeological dis- coveries made in Cyprus during the past year. Excavations which were begun in 1933 at a late Stone Age site near the village of Erimi were con- tinued. During the first season the three upper layers were cleared. This year a fourth and fifth were investigated. The fifth stratum proved to be the most important so far found. The foundations of two large circular houses were found. Outside the entrance to one "a burial was discovered revealing</page><page sequence="5">le2 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the first human remains belonging to the Stone Age in Cyprus." The body was buried in a con- tracted position, and there were no offerings of any kind. Plain pottery, mostly red-slip ware, was found in the earlier settlements in contrast to the painted wares common in the upper layers. Trial diggings were conducted in various parts of the island. They revealed a widespread Neolithic culture, and give promise of many important excavations to be carried out in the future. The (late of the beginning of the prehistoric civilization on the island of Cyprus must now be put back into the fourth millennium B.C. The Cyprus Museum expedition also investi- gated the site of a temple, three miles east of Kyrenia. The building seems to have been erected in the seventh century B.C., and to have survived until the Byzantine period. Many, terracottas were found in the vicinity. A royal tolmb) discovered near the village of Pyla was also cleared, and proved to be a very interesting find. It consisted of a dromos leading into a large cen- tral chamber, off which were three smaller rooms. The tomb had been completely rifled. It is to be dated probably in the fourth century B.C. Mention is made also of a hoard (441) of silver coins, of the fifth century, accidentally discovered at Larnaca, part of the ancient town of Kition. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Prehistoric Epirus and the Dorian Invasion.- In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 131-179 (3 pls., 7 figs.), N. G. L. HAMMOND finds that the relatively few archaeological indications clearly show con- nection of prehistoric Epirus with Macedonia. He discusses the terrain of Epirus and the Pindus routes, the literary evidence for the Dorian in- vasion, the evidence posterior to the Dorian in- vasion (distribution of dialects, tribal connections and the like), showing the northwest connections of the Dorian peoples, and the archaeological evi- dence for the theory that the Dorians came into Greece from the northwest, sojourning on the way in Epirus. The description and discussion of the Pindus routes and the comparison of the small prehistoric settlements in Epirus with those of the \lach shepherds of the present day are illuminat- ing. The writer finds that the literary tradition is trustworthy. He concludes that "it is clear that the Dorians in the general sense issued from Mace- donia and Epirus, and in Epirus we may hope to find a clue to the culture which they brought to Greece." Antissa.-Excavations in 1932.-In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 41-67 (9 pls., 17 figs.), Miss W. LAMB describes her excavations at Antissa in 1932 (cf. ibid. p. 264, also A.J.A. xxxvi, 1930, p. 359; xxxvii, 1933, p. 628). The two apsidal build- ings were probably temples. The earlier one had its apse at the east and a porch at the west end. It was divided by four cross walls. It must have been built in the ninth or tenth century. The later one had its apse at the west end and had two cross walls. It dates from the eighth century. Several early walls, a paved area with two fine polygonal walls, and a long, narrow building (stoa) were un- covered. The contents of tombs found by peas- ants, and of others found by the excavators, are published. The pottery found is prehistoric Les- bian Red Ware, Lesbian "bucchero," Cycladic, Rhodian, Protocorinthian, Corinthian, Naucra- tite, Laconian, and Attic, besides some other wares. Terracottas, lamps, a few metal objects, many bronze coins, one object of bone, and two legs of a large stone bowl were unearthed. These lesser finds are dated from prehistoric times to the destruction of the town by the Romans in 167 B.C. Haliartos. -Excavations in 1931.-In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 180-212 (3 pls., 15 figs.), R. P. AUSTIN gives the results of excavations at Haliartos in 1931. The temple and the long build- ing discovered in 1926 were fully excavated. The temple was Doric, distyle in antis, the porch being at the east end. The nearest parallel is perhaps the older temple of Nemesis or Themis at Rhamnus (date ca. 510 B.C.), the dimensions of which were 6.4 m. Iby 10.7 m. The date of the temple at Haliar- tos appears, to judge by pottery and architectural fragments, to be not long after 550 B.C. Founda- tions of an earlier temple were found just to the north. The long building to the south of the tem- ple (21 m. by 8.90 m.) had two doorways ill the eastern long side and a row of four columns, prob- ably of wood, within. Its purpose is not clear; it may have been a lesche like that of the Cnidians at Delphi. A paved passage flanked by fine polygonal walls led to the temenos and also to the long hall. Just outside the temenos, to the west of the temple, was a deposit of pottery and other obljects evidently thrown out from the temple. On five adjoining fragments of a black cylix was a dedication to Athena which enables us to give a name to the temple - one of those which Pausanias</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 1923 could not identify. Little prehellenic or geometric pottery, not much of the seventh century, more of the sixth and fifth centuries, and still more of the fourth century and Hellenistic times was found. A terracotta antefix with a seven-leaved palmette and inverted lotus is probably of the sixth century. Various objects of terracotta and other materials were unearthed. There are two fragmentary proxeny decrees, one of the fourth and one of the third century B.C. Only nine coins are listed, all of bronze, the earliest being of the fourth century B.C., the latest Venetian. An ap- pendix gives the history of the site from the earliest times to the destruction of the city by the Romans in 171 B.C. The Ionian Islands.- Sites and Antiquities.- In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-19322, pp. 13-,246 (5 pls., "25 figs.), SYLVIA BENTON records observations made during two summers on the Ionian Islands (Zakynthos, Kephallenia, Ithaka, Leukas, Mega- nisi, Arkoude, Atokos, Kalamos, The Archipelago, Astokos, Kythera) and the coast of Akarnania and Aetolia. The sites described are very numerous, and at many of them prehistoric sherds and other objects were found. Remains dating from other periods are numerous. Few of these islands have been carefully studied, and the relation of their culture to that of other regions, especially in ipre- historic times, as indicated by the pottery and other objects is of great interest. The writer be- lieves that many sites would repay more thorough examination. There are good sketch maps and other illustrations, and bibliographical references are very full. Researches at Isthmia.-In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 68-89 (1 pl., 12 figs.), R. J. H. JENKINS and H. MEGAW give the results of re- searches made at the supposed site of the precinct of Poseidon at the Isthmus and of the Isthmnian (Games. Nothing earlier than Roman times was found in or very near the "precinct," and almost everything is later. The walls of the "precinct" are uniform in construction except at the north- east gateway, the core of which is a Roman tri- umphal arch. The earliest settlement here was in the first century after Christ. Comparison with walls erected under Justinian in other places shows that the walls of the "precinct" are of his time. The "precinct" itself is a fort forming part of Justinian's fortification of the Isthmus, and the existing remains of the wall across the Isthmus are of the same date. Near the hamlet of Kyras Vryse ancient water-channels and some houlse walls were found, as well as numerous fragments of pottery, a votive terracotta, and a fragment of terracotta from a cornice. It is certain that the temnenos of Poseidon was not where it has been hitherto generally supposed to have been, and it may well have been at the head of the ravine near Kyras Vryse. The Origin of the Iphigeneia Legend.-In L'Antiquith (Classique, iii (fasc. 2), 1934, pp. 393- 409, PAUL CLEMENT offers confirmatory material for the interpretation of the Iphigeneia legend set forth by Henri Gregoire in the introduction to his recent edition of the Iphigeneia Taurica of Eurip- ides (Paris, Soci6te d'edition "Les Belles Let- tres," 1925, Vol. IV, pp. 86 ff.). The evidence in question consists of two Thessalian inscriptions, dedications to Artemis which, he argues, attest her worship as a fertility goddess by devotees who bear the ritualistic name vE3pol (fawns) - a cult complex paralleled point for point, except for the sacred animal involved, by the Attic cult of Artemis Brauronia. In establishing the exist- ence of a cult of Artemis whose ritual could have produced a legend such as that of Iphigeneia (just as the ritual of the cult of Artemis Brauronia pro- duced similar, though less famous legends) an- other link is added to the chain of evidence which indicates not only that the word Iphigeneia is an old epithet ("she who causes the birth of strong off-spring") of Artemis, but also that the legend of Agamemnon's daughter is derived in whole, or greater part, from the cult ritual of Artemis. ARCHITECTURE Propylaea and Bastion.-HANS SCHLEIF (Jb. Arch. I. xlviii, 1933, pp. 177-184) criticizes the observations, drawings, interpretations, and con- clusions contained in an article by W. WREDE (Ath. Mitt. Ivii, 1932, pp. 74-91), who argued that the Nike bastion was built after the Propylaea. According to Schleif the pillar east of the stair, contemporary with the Propylaea, was not in- tended to be visible in its lower part. The plan of this pillar and the L connecting it with the double anta does riot correspond to the old temenos wall so closely as Wrede represented, and such cor- respondence as exists is only coincidence. The wall on which the pillar stands is indeed connected with the old temenos wall but is earlier than the pillar. This pillar has a similar but wider pre- decessor, which was there when the stair and bastion were built; when Mnesicles built the later pillar, the upper part of the stair was rebuilt.</page><page sequence="7">124 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY The orientation of the Propylaea was determined by the north wall of the bastion. The original level of the top of the bastion was that of the euthyn- teria of the Nike temple, and probably it so remained after the partial reconstruction of the stair; but later it was lowered to correspond with the second step of the Propylaea, and the top step of the stair was then reduced in height. SCULPTURE Hellenistic Stelae.-E. PFUHL (Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 751-754) adds some comments to his previous discussion of the stele of Menas, third century B.C. (cf. A.J.A. xxxvii, 1933, p. 326). He publishes another stele at Istambul, of similar style but probably later date. Both show a style derived from Hellenistic painting. Hellenistic Sculpture.- Some remarks on Hel- lenistic sculpture are published by G. RODEN- WALDT (Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 748-750). The great period extended from 225 to 175; this was pre- ceded by a period of transition from the classical style. Dipylon Grave Relief.-In the Works of the Archaeological Institute of the Franz Joseph University at Szeged, ix-x, pp. 166-182, A. BUDAY reconsiders the interpretation of the Dipylon grave relief published by Dumont, R.A., 1869, ii, pp. 233-250, 421-433. He considers that we have here a meal to which the dead man is invited and that the dead man is arriving in the boat to take part in the meal. Such a motif may be originally of Egyptian origin. The motif of the man arriving on a horse appeared later after the disappearance of the distinction between the cult of the heroes and of the dead. Fragment of a Grave Stele from Athens.-In the Archaeologiai ?rtesiti, xlvi, p. 38, D. SICILI- ANOS pictures a fragment of a grave stele from Athens, representing the head of a man. It is of some artistic value and seems to come from the second half of the fifth century B.c. TERRACOTTAS Archaic Argive Terracottas to 525 B.C.-In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 23-40 (5 pls., 1 fig.), R. J. H. JENKINS discusses archaic Argive terra- cottas, which he divides into classes as follows: A, ca.720-ca.610 (comprising four examples, all from the Argive Heraeum, no two of which are of the same date); B, ca.600; C, 590-560; D, 560- 550; E, 550-510; F, 550 onwards; G, 545-52~5. The Argive tradition is unbroken until, with Class F, eastern influence brings in mass-production and over-ornamentation. The seated female figure comes in at this time, and Corinthian influence is strong, growing stronger in Class G. VASES Groups of Mid-Sixth Century Black-Figure.- In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 1-q22 (11 pls., 2 figs.), J. D. BEAZLEY lists and describes about one hundred and forty black-figure vases painted in the middle decades of the sixth century, classify- ing them, ascribing them to their authors, and publishing a few of them. Previous lists are cor- rected. A large group-"Group E"-is closely related to Exekias, but earlier. Seventy-one vases are assigned to "The Swinger" (the Swing Painter, Boston 98, 916). A brief account of sig- natures of painters and potters is appended. The article contains new attributions, besides register- ing acceptance of attributions made by others. The Laconian Krater from Eleutherna.- In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 247-250, J. P. DROOP attacks the dating by Miss M. HARTLEY (B.S.A. xxxi, pp. 111 ff.) of the Laconian krater from Eleutherna about the middle of the sixth century. Ibid., xxxii, pp. 251-254, Miss Hartley maintains that she was right and refutes the accusation that she failed to make use of facts ascertained by the excavators of Sparta. Professor Droop heads his article "Facts or Fancies?"; Miss Hartley en- titles hers "Facts." NUMISMATICS Greek Numerals.-In Istros, i, pp. 14-18, P. WUILLEUMIER discusses a die discovered at Tarentum which contains the beginning of the Greek numerals instead of the literal numeration. The die probably dates from about 500 B.c. and is interesting for the forms of the letters which are archaic and show Doric influences. The use of letters on this is similar to that on two Etruscan dice which have since been lost. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Ionian Tribes of Histria. - In Istros, i, pp. 117- 126, SCARLAT LAMBRINO discusses the Ionian tribes of Histria. The names of two of these, the Aigikoreis and the Argadeis, we know from Roman times, but it is clear that in the second century B.C. they were organized into a unity presided over by wTglveoL. Their chief gods were the Nymphs and Zeus Ombrimos, and these</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 1H5 names show the persistence of the agricultural character of the colonists. ARCHITECTURE Sanctuary of Argive Hera near Paestum.- A brief report is given in L'Illustrazione Italiiana, September 30, 1934, p. 514, of the recent discovery of the famous sanctuary of Hera near Paestum. PROFESSOR MAIURI speaks of it as the greatest archaeological discovery of the year. The sanctu- ary is mentioned by early writers, Strabo 95,5 Pliny iii, 5, 10, and others, where the founding is traditionally ascribed to Jason and the Argonauts. Search for the site was begun in April under the direction of DR. ZANCANI MONTUORO and DR. UMBERTO ZANOTTI BIANCO, Director of the "Societa Magna Grecia." The temple was located at a site which agrees with Strabo's account, about two kilometres from the sea and nine from Paes- tum. Many important finds were made in the excavation, carried on during May and June. Remains of a Doric temple, having pronaos, cella, and opisthodomos and a peripteral colon- nade, 16.80 x 39.50 m. were revealed. It is built of local limestone similar to that used in the "Basilica" at Paestum and dates about 500 B.C. Fragments of a sculptured metope showing Herakles' theft of the Delphic tripod and other pieces probably from the pediment were found. About fifteen metres from the temple another smaller building was cleared. Between it and the temple were dumps of votive offerings, heads and figurines dating from the fourth to the end of the second century. Over 6,000 small terracotta heads were found, also many statuettes, vase fragments and coins. Some terracotta fragments and two important finds, an archaic Doric capital and a sculptured metope in an excellent state of preser- vation, prove the existence of an earlier temple on the site. SCULPTURE Portraits of Late Roman Emperors.-R. DEL- BRUECK publishes (Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 758 ff.) a few notes supplementary to his book. A bronze head in Munich, which he had regarded as Con- stantius Chlorus, is found to be modern and to belong to a series intended for the Maximilian monument at Innsbruck. The heads of Con- stantine on his arch are found, in the fine illus- trations published by L'Orange, to be better than they had appeared. The iconography of Con- stantine is now fairly clear. AFRICA Stone Age Art found in Libyan Desert. -In The Illustrated London News, November 17, 1934, pp. 796-799, DR. JAMES MURPHY gives a brief account of the fourth expedition into the Libyan Desert under the leadership of Count Almasy, the Hungarian explorer. A complete investigation of the wadis on the north slope of the Gilf Kebir resulted in the conviction that they formed the legendary Oasis of Zarzura. The expedition went on to explore Mount Owenat, about .00 kilo- meters south of the Gilf Kebir. The mountain was first discovered, in 19Q5, by Hassanein Bey, noted Egyptian explorer. At this time a number of pre- historic rock-carvings were found. The side of the mountain, which is a granite mass over 6,000 feet high, is heaped with great boulders, many of which form small caves. Count Almasy and his companions discovered twelve of these caves, with roofs covered with paintings "whose colors looked as fresh and bright as the frescoes of the Vatican." About 800 individual pictures were counted, mostly animals, but a few with human figures. A few flint implements were also found. No definite conclusions have been reached as to the date of the paintings. The material is being studied by Professor Leo Frobenius. Count Almasy believes that he has confirmed the account of the Ethiopian troglodytes given by Herodotus, Bk. iv, 183. The cattle "that walk backwards as they graze because their horns curve outwards in front of their heads " may be represented in the frescoes. ALBANIA Bronze Axes.-In Istros, i, pp. 44-59, RADU VULPE considers the bronze axes of the Albano- Dalmatian type. These have been found only along the coast from Cattaro to Peshasi. They are apparently not intended for use, since they all have a spur on the lower side. The closest parallels are from Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean. The author believes that we have here the remains of Phoenician influence, which the Greeks dis- covered on their entrance into the Adriatic and which they symbolized as the Illyrian kingdom of Cadmus. THE BALKANS Prehistoric Sites in the Balkan-Danubian Region.--In Istros, i, pp. 37-43, VLADIMIR DU- MITRESCU considers the eneolithic stations in the Balkan-Danubian region and decides that Boian</page><page sequence="9">126 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY A is distinctly older than Gumnelnita A which succeeded it and is superimposed upon it in most of the stations. This is particularly clear at Atmageaua-Tatarasci. The pottery in the first instance is incised and not excised and the mean- der pattern is handled much more frequently and skillfully. The author also discusses various problems in connection with the site of Cucuteni. He criticizes the arguments of H. Schmidt, who seeks to find the source of this culture in the Bukk culture of Hungary, and believes that the painted pottery was brought in from Asia, probably in the I Thes- salian period. The site of Cucuteni dates probably betwecen 2800 and 1400 with the boundary be- tween Cucuteni A and B about 2220-2150. The entire culture belongs in the age of metals. The station of Ariusd also can be dated before 2500. He also believes that the anthropomorphic figures at Cucuteni are feminine and are similar to the female goddess of Asia Minor. As regard the culture of Gumelnita, he regards Gumelnita A as related to the last part of Cucuteni A. BULGARIA Archaeologia Hungarica.- In Acta Archaeo- logica Musei Nationalis Hungarici, xv, DR. NANDOR FETTICH discusses Der Skythische Fund von Gartschinowo, Budapest, 1934 (14 pls., I fig.). He publishes here the bronze hoard discovered at Gartschinowo, in northeastern Bulgaria, about 50 kilometres south of Rustschuk, and now in the Museum at Schumen. They were found in 19-4, but their importance was only realized after the publication of the Scythian finds at Zdldhalom- puszta (ibid. iii). Dr. Fettich was asked to examine this new material. It clears up many old problems. Among the objects found at Gartschinowo is a bronze stamp giving the same scenes of fighting animals and stag motives found on gold objects from Zildhalompuszta. The designs prove to be Scythian and not Greek or Persian in origin, and throw a great deal of light on this nomad people and their connection with the Far East, in fact, on the whole problem of nomad culture. The objects date in the archaic Scythian period, about the sixth century B.C. GERMANY Roman Mosaics in Germany.- A first attempt to trace the development of style in Roman mosaics found in Germany is made by E. KRItGER (Arch. Anz., 1933, 656-710; 26 figs.). A few "aus dem grisseren Deutschland," from Salzburg, are included. The region of Trier is particularly rich. The mosaics from Pompeii determine the early style; the terminus ante quem is the downfall of Roman power at the beginning of the fifth century; useful punctuation is supplied by the Germanic invasions of 260-275, which left many archaeo- logical traces. Opus vermiculatum rarely occurs. By a study of style, Kruger distinguishes five periods. In the first, before Antoninus Pius, the white ground is conspicuous, the ornament is mostly simple and geometrical, figure panels are absent at first and then occur singly as central features, the polygons are usually separated by plain black lines. In the second period, apparently brief, patterns and color are richer, curving lines are more frequent, figure panels are com- moner, the guilloche used more. To this period, or the beginning of the next, belongs the mosaic found at Trier which, because of its inscription of M. Piaonius Victorinus, has always been dated about 250 and has confused the study of mosaics. The inscription in fact records only a repair of the mosaic. The third and finest period is the second half of the second century. Figure panels are numerous now, and a continuous and conspicuous guilloche bounds all divisions of the pattern. Here belong the Nennig mosaic, perhaps the finest of all in pattern and execution, and the Kiln mosaic with portraits of philosophers. In the fourth period, ca. 200-9260, the figure panels, which in one instance number 50, and guilloche occupy nearly all the field; other ornament is almost limited to borders. In the fifth period, after 275, both guil- loche and figure panels are rare; designs are meager, poorly arranged and poorly drawn. HUNGARY Archaeologiai ErtesitS.- LAJOS NAGY, xlvi, pp. 161-163, describes a serpent-wrapped Cerberus which was found in Aquincum. The teeth and tongues were inserted and the eyes and neck were silvered. This is a rare type and is perhaps another proof of the spread of the Sarapis cult in Pan- nonia.- JOZSEF HOLLRIGL, pp. 85-99, discusses the pottery of the Araad period, especially those vessels with a broad base which are made for cooking over an open fire. The oldest are bomb- shaped and must have been more common than the remains indicate. The later forms seem to be derived from this. He also publishes two ceramic shells which were apparently made to be worn around the neck or in the hair. These and some</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 127 other objects might be dated from the LaTene period, but other remains from the same finds show that we must date them in the eleventh century. - LASZL6 JANKO, pp. 174-177, describes a bronze sword found at SzentgMl. It is remarkable because of the disk-like decoration on the hilt. The sword is dated from the middle of the second millennium B.c. and is either of Italian workman- ship or was made on an Italian model.- KATALIN POLL MARKINE, pp. 62-84, describes three gold armlets found at Zsennye. These are braided and provided with conventionalized animal heads as in the Scythian art. The author decides that it was in south Russia that the braided armlet was united with the animal heads, and that the pres- ent examples arrived in Hungary before the Magyar invasion by way of trade.- ZOLTAN ()ROSZLAN, pp. 44-53, describes a relief in the Hungarian National Museum of a young man in chains holding one hand over a fire. He decides that this is a rough reproduction of Mucius Scaevola and brings it into connection with the frequent Pannonian reliefs based on Roman mythology. Thus there are reproductions in Pannonia of Mars and Rhea-Sylvia and other similar themes.-On pp. 54-61, the author pictures a Pannonian relief of Athena being pur- sued by Hephaestos. Behind him are two figures, perhaps daughters of Erichthonios. Works of the Archaeological Institute of the Franz Joseph University in Szeged.-DR. J. BANNER, pp. 54-84, discusses a cemetery discovered near H6dmez6vi~sarhely. This dates chiefly from the Tisza III period, but there are traces of sporadic burials through the Late Middle Ages. In Tisza III there was also a settle- inent and the roof columns of the house have been found. The house was four-sided, but the sides were not parallel nor equal in length.- D)R. BANNER, pp. 30-43, discusses a neolithic settlement near Kopancs. This belongs almost entirely in the Tisza Culture I and was apparently destroyed by plunderers, as was the settlement of K6k6nydomb of the same period. The settlement showed that the houses were built in rows parallel to the river and that a second row inland was of later date. This will explain many problems of the lack of stratification in the Alfald.-DR. F. HOLLENDONNER, pp. 303-306, studies the wood remains found near Kopincs and shows that they give evidence for the existence of oak forests around the Hungarian plain at early periods.- )it. LAJOS MARTON, pp. 93-165, lists the LaTine finds in the entire area along the Danube, the Tisza, and in Siebenbuirgen. He points out that the chief problem offered is that of the relation- ship between the Celts and the Scythians in this area and the extension of the various tribes and their interrelations. - DR. A. BALINT, pp. 183- 189, discusses some Jazig graves excavated in Martdly in 1933. From two Roman coins in bad condition and a comparison with the fibulae in the Hungarian plain, the author concluded that the date is perhaps that of Caracalla (198-217 A.D.). None of the finds contradict this. He also lists various other remains found near Martlvy. - JOZSEF MALLISZ, pp. 3-15, makes a preliminary report on the Nandor caves near Hunyad, where he found evidence suggesting the occupation of the caves in the Eolithic period and the continued occupation of the area through the Upper Paleo- lithic as well as in the later Neolithic periods. He explains the confusion whereby the results obtained by Dr. Sofie Torma were disputed and explains away the unfortunate controversy that followed her announcements. -DR. A. BALINT and DR. M. PXRDUCZ, pp. 44-53, discuss a settle- ment recently discovered near Oszentivin. The material is scanty, but it dates from five periods. The most interesting thing is the light that it throws on the relations with the Baden culture which seems to be later than Tisza III.- JOZSEF FLEISSIG and TIVADER KORMOS, pp. 16-29, dis- cuss some finds at Sittelbruch, not far from Sfitta, in a cleft in the fresh water chalk deposits. These consist of certain animal bones of a Mediterranean character, some of which show distinct traces of working. The authors regard it as likely that stone works of the Chellean period can be found on further examination, although it is not impossible that this settlement did not know the working of stone. - KALMAN CZOGLER, pp. 298-303, studies the mussels found in ar- chaeological sites near Szeged, both as to their species and the uses to which the various species were put. Thus the fresh water mussel shells were rarely used for ornamentation of any kind.- G. CSALLXNY, pp. 221--250, lists the remains of the Avar and early Magyar periods in the Museum of Szentes. Among the first group there are differ- ences which perhaps separate the Huns from the Avars. With regard to the Magyar remains, he admits that some may be of Slavic origin, but he disagrees with Niederle that the majority are non-Magyar. In this period, in all the graves, we find the head and foot of a horse. The rest of the</page><page sequence="11">1Q8 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY body was probably consumed at the funeral feast. The second group of late graves, which are poorer in content, may be in part of Slavic origin, but they must be of the period of the dynasty of Arpad.- DR. E. ZALOTAY, pp. 85-92, discusses a cemetery recently discovered at Szentes-Kistoke which belongs to the culture of Bodrogkeresztur. It seems that the area around the lower Koros was the most densely populated area at this period, if we may judge from the remains already found.- DR. D. CSALLiNY, pp. 906-9.14, discusses a grave found at Szentes Lapist6. He believes that it comes from the Kuturgur-Bulgars who passed through Hungary in the sixth-seventh centuries A.D.--MECHTILDIS NEES, pp. 163-174, describes a collection of bronzes found at Tibold- Dar6c. The collection falls into two parts, those of the Hallstatt period and those of a pre-Christian era. It is quite extensive, but the idea suggests itself that they form a deposit hidden by some modern plunderer, since otherwise it would be hard to see how the objects were collected.- GYULA T6R6K, pp. 190-9205, lists the so-called Vandal finds in Hungary. He considers many of them very doubtful and believes that local in- fluences played a great r6le in the culture of the Vandals and the other Germanic tribes. In regard to the Quadi he believes that they remained in a very limited area in the northern Alfild. In con- clusion he believes that the entire question deserves a thorough consideration. LITHUANIA Excavations at Apuole. - The Lithuanian Tele- graph Agence ("Elta") Service in its number for September, 1934, reports on the excavations carried on at the old tumulus of Apuole which has been identified as the ancient Apulia mentioned by Rimbert in his Vitis Angarii. The fort seems to have been occupied at three periods from the first to the seventeenth centuries A.D. In its earlier periods, it had a wooden rampart which had been burned at least once. There is evidence also that agriculture was the main occupation of the early inhabitants. The interior of the fortress has not yet been excavated. RUMANIA Sarcophagus from Tomis. -In Istros, i, pp. 81- 116), EMIO COLIU makes a detailed study of a sarcophagus discovered in Tomis (Constanta) in 1931. This was an elaborate piece of work and was probably placed in an arcosolium similar to that of Aurelios Chryseros of Termessos. It seems likely that this formed one of a series bordering on an alley. The sarcophagus is elaborately decorated on the Greek pattern and bears on it a collection of seven symbols-tongs, whip, bell, scales, bull's head, axe and spear. The author considers these to be symbols of the god Men and believes that we have here the first definite evidence of the worship of this Phrygian god in the Danubian area. The work apparently dates from the second century A.D. SPAIN Walls of Tarragona.- In 1930 ADOLF FICK, now dead, prepared for ADOLF SCHULTEN drawings and photographs of the walls of Tarragona. Some of them are published, with Fick's preliminary report, in Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 489-512;-; 2 Beilagen, ?25 figs. There is no literary evidence on the walls, and no considerable archaeological study had previously been made. Fick distin- guishes nine periods: 1 and 9, pre-Roman; 3, with Iberian mason's marks, Republican; 4, probably Augustan; 5, third century; 6, slightly later; 7 and 8, mediaeval; 9, modern. The usual width is about 5.80 m. Three accessible gates, and two others partially preserved, are pre-Roman; they are 2.90-1.50 m. high and 1.40-1.50 broad. One Roman gate is much larger and is covered by two arches. It appears that gates toward the land were protected by towers, while those toward the sea were not. In the "Cyclopean" walls three styles are distinguishable: one, with a great abundance of small stones, is probably mediaeval rebuilding despite the absence of mortar; a second makes some structural use of small stones and uses large stones that are shaped somewhat; in the third and principal class the stones on the outside are large and unshaped, with smaller pieces for filling, while on the inside are stones of medium size with little or no filling. The Roman walls, extant in some places above the "Cyclopean" parts, are about 5 m. thick, but about 3.80 m. of this is miscel- laneous material between two relatively light walls of dressed stone without mortar. A descrip- tion of the existing walls, stretch by stretch, is given. No opinion is expressed by Fick in regard to the builders of the pre-Roman walls. A. SCHULTEN publishes (ibid. pp. 548-551) a relief found in 1932 in one of the towers. Only the lower part is preserved; it represents Athena; the style is regarded as provincialGreek, and the fourth century B.C. is suggested as its date. The relief</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 129 comes from a part of the wall which Fick con- sidered Roman. According to Schulten the oldest wall (Fick's 1 and 2) is Etruscan of the sixth century; the second (Fick's 3 and 4) is Iberian of the fourth century B.C. Schulten's Work.- A. SCIIULTEN describes his travels and research in Spain and Portugal, 1928-- 1933 (Arch. Anz., 1933, pp. 513-566; 17 figs.). One is impressed by the author's tireless energy and also by the indications of archaeological work by numerous Spanish investigators. Segobriga, a site near Saelices, Cuenca province, has consider- able Roman remains. A hill, La Serreta, near Alcoy, has yielded, inter alia, a lead tablet with the longest Iberian inscription known. The letters are Ionic Greek of the sixth century and Schulten conjectures that it is a list, made by an Ionic overseer, of Iberian workmen. The camp of the Scipios, near Alnienara, is described and a plan is given. Made in 217 B.C., it is the earliest Roman camp known. Two other Roman camps are described: one, the "Cava do Viriato," in Portugal, the other 60 km. from Corunna. In 1930 Schulten sought once more for Tartessos, still without success; he thinks that it was perhaps on the same site as the Roman settlement near the mouth of the Guadalquivir, but at a lower level. La Guardia, in Gallicia, has a noteworthy wall of the sixth century B.C., perhaps a citadel built by foreign traders. The "Tower of Herakles" at Corunna is somewhat discussed. A site near Belmonte may represent the ancient Segida; apparently it deserves further investigation. At Alicante excavation has yielded fair results. At Herrerias (Almeria province) L. Siret has made discoveries extending from 2500 B.C. to the Arab period. Two fine lions of "Tartessian Art" in the museum at Cordoba are mentioned. Many other places are dealt with also. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL ARMENIA Armenian Art of Lwow.- In the Prace Komisji Historji Sztuki, vi, pp. 61-163, TADEUSZ MAN- KOWSKI makes a detailed study of the Armenian art of Lwow which centres around the Armenian Cathedral of that city. This building was started apparently in 1363 although it has been much altered since that time. Architecturally it agrees with Armenian structures on the shore of the Black Sea and shows especial similarity with some of the churches in Kaffa. From the stand- point of decoration, it shows the influence of the Islamic art of the day which had exerted strong influence on Armenia, after the loss of national independence. The indications of the mural paint- ings are that they were in the Armenian tradi- tion. Especial emphasis must be laid upon the work of the miniaturists and illuminators of Lwow. Among these we may mention Minas z Tokatu and Lazarz z Babertu. Many of the manu- scripts illuminated by the latter are preserved now in the Orient. It is however, evident that these miniaturists fell under the sway of Westerin influences and they served as an important source for the spreading of Western influence through Armenia and other parts of Asia. CZECHOSLOVAKIA Gothic Painting from the Region of the Carpa- thians. -Ibid., pp. 1-40, ADAM BOCHNAK discusses a group of Gothic paintings from the region of the Carpathians. There is a group of Madonnas, especially from Stary Sacz, Przydonica, Lopuszna, Chelmiec, and Cerekiew, which date from the fifteenth century and seem to come from the same hand, perhaps one Jacobus, pictor de Nova San- decz. The Madonnas are of a Czech type, quiet and mystical. The painter had a fondness for drapery and for rendering elaborate designs upon them. The Madonnas differ from the Czech type because the grove in the background is always a rose grove. Similar in style is a painting of St. Catherine of Alexandria in the parish church of Biecz, but this seems somewhat later. The last of the group is the crowning of the Madonna by the Holy Trinity in the Church of Krosno. This can be dated in 151~. We have apparently in these paintings remains of a definite artist or school that worked in Nowy Sacz at the end of the fifteenth century. Their works are not only of historical interest but of real artistic value. GREECE Middle Byzantine Churches. -In B.S.A. xxxii, 1931-1932, pp. 90-130 (5 pls., 5 figs.), H. MEGAW discusses "The Chronology of some Middle Byzantine Churches" in Greece, employing ex- ternal (literary and epigraphic) and internal (structural and ornamental) evidence. The churches dated in the eleventh century are: The Katholikon of Hagios Loukas, H. Apostoloi at Athens (first quarter); Theotokos of Hagios Loukas, Panagia Lykodemou at Athens, H.</page><page sequence="13">130 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Aikaterine at Athens (second quarter); Kapni- karea, Kapnikarea Exonarthex, and H. Theo- doroi, all at Athens (third quarter); Daphni in Attica, Kaisariani in Attica, Ligourio in Argolis (fourth quarter). Those dated in the twelfth century are: Chonika in Argolis, Amphissa in Phocis, Plataniti in Attica (first quarter); loannes Kynegos in Attica, H. Nikolaos sta Kampia in Boeotia, Hagia Mone in Argolis (second quarter); Sagmata in Boeotia, Omorphe Ekklesia in Attica, Gastoune in Elis (third quarter); Merbaka in Argolis, Vlachernai in Elis (fourth quarter). HUNGARY Italian Romanesque Influence on Hungarian Art. -In the Archaeologiai Jrtesit6, xlvi, pp. 100- 113, ILONA BALOGH discusses the Italian Roman- esque influence on various Hungarian works, at Pecs, Jak, Gyulafehervar, and Esztergom. She shows many parallels between the work at Pecs and that of Benedetto Antelami of the School of Parma, but there are many other features of the entire Lombard School which are reflected in Hungary. Venetian Head.- Ibid., pp. 116-120, ERVIN YBL discusses a Venetian head which was prob- ably the work of Master Marcus at the end of the fourteenth century and represents the union of the influence of Giovanni Pisano and Venetian Gothic. Triptych in the Museum for Christian Art in Esztergom.- Ibid., pp. 121-136, ANDOR PIGLER discusses a section of a triptych in the Museum for Christian art in Esztergom. The interior repre- sents Christ playing in the garden. The exterior, an attractive girl, and outside the house a horse, wine casks, etc. On the basis of an old German wood cut, we may conclude that we have here a representation of the evagationes spiritus, the charms that allure the layman to turn his thought from religion. It is an Austrian work and we can date it at the end of the fifteenth century. POLAND Work of Giambattista Pittoni in Krakow. - In the Prace Komisji Historji Sztuki, vi, pp. 41-60, ZBIGNIEW BOCHENSKI studies the works of Giambattista Pittoni in the Church of Our Lady in Krakow. The painting of the Annunciation there was painted by him, but the author believes that we can assign four other paintings to the same man, i.e. the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, the Adoration of the Magi, the Madonna and Child appearing to St. Philip Ndri and St. Mary Magdalen. The types of all these recur in other paintings by Pittoni now in Italy and the paint- ings in Krakow are probably by him, for they come from the period when Italian art was very popular in Poland, in the eighteenth century.</page><page sequence="14">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS PLATES XXIII-XXIV On December 12th the German Archaeological Institute held their annual meeting in honor of Winckelmann. The Director, Dr. Karo, first gave the necrology list for the year, which included Emil Reisch, Edmond Pottier, Duncan Macken- zie and the two Athenians, Christos Tsountas and Michael Deffner. Dr. Karo then summarized the work of the German Institute in 1934, beginning with Professor Buschor's excavations in Samos, where during the 1934 campaign the most impor- tant remains discovered were the foundations of a long building south of the ancient altars. The plan of this structure recalls that of the so-called Sanctuary of the Bulls at Delos, which, it has been suggested, had been built by one of the Hellenistic rulers to house his flagship after a naval victory and as a dedication to Apollo. The Samian building may well have been erected for the vessel which made the memorable trip under Kolaios' captaincy to Tartessos on the Atlantic seaboard of Spain about the end of the sixth century.1 These foundations were covered by other constructions soon after 500 B.C., and these in turn disappeared during the course of the fifth century. The German School also continued its work in the Kerameikos of Athens,2 at Leucas- Ithaka under Professor Dirpfeld, and in Aegina under Dr. Welter. They discovered neolithic re- mains in the small island in Lake Karla in Mace- donia. Dr. Karo was followed by Dr. Kunze who read a paper on the "Geometric Art from Ti- ryns," emphasizing its unusual features, the ex- traordinarily original type of human figures repre- sented on the pottery, the life-size terracotta masks, etc. Both on the Acropolis and in the National Museum many changes have been made and a great deal of work done, in the first case, in the way of repairs and reconstruction, and in the Museum, rearrangement of objects to facilitate their study and to improve the general appear- ance of the various rooms and cases. The finds from the Dipylon have been arranged according to graves and the large collection of white leky- thoi are now in chronological order, while a re- arrangement of the small finds from the early excavations at the Heraeum of Argos, as well as those from the Artemis Orthia precinct at Sparta and from Perachora, gives them much better lighting and renders them more accessible for study. The best of the gold and silver ornaments have been put in new glass cases and a beginning has been made in the rearrangement of the Myce- naean collection. Special exhibition rooms have been set aside for a complete series of Gillibron's copies of the Minoan and Mycenaean frescoes, figurines, gold work, weapons, etc., and these provide an exceptionally useful means of making a comparative study of the Cretan and mainland developments. Many pieces of sculpture have been brought from the storerooms and put on ex- hibition. The archaic "Apollo" from Megara is being set up in the Archaic Sculpture room oppo- site the one from Sunion. This involved moving the Apollo of the Omphalos into the next room where he appears to much better advantage. The Hygieia head from Tegea has been cleaned and placed on a new pedestal. A number of grave re- liefs hitherto in storerooms have now been put oii view. The newly exhibited bronzes include the very beautiful female head from Perinthos in Thrace3 (P1. XXIII, Fig. 1), and the small bronzes from the excavations of M. Valmin near Hagios Floros in Triphylia. Most important are those from the Academy of Athens. These include a great round pot with flat out-turning edge, a shallow saucer- like bowl with concentric circles engraved in the interior, and a large askos, the middle part of its handle being of ivory (Fig. 2). This latter is unique and un-Greek in appearance to the ex- perts. In the same case with the bronze pots are other objects from the Academy region: gold necklaces, earrings, and goldleaf diadems, the top of a thyrsos in terracotta and a magnificent early black-figured amphora in perfect condition showing a siren in the panel on one side and an interesting many-winged figure suggesting the I Herodotos, IV, 152. 2 Reported in News Items, A.J.A., XXXVIII, 1934, p. 599. 3 B.C.H., XLVIII, 1924, pp. 0276 ff., pl.

The formation last year of the Society of Friends of the Museum marks an important advance and the Museum has already received valuable gifts from its supporters. These include shoulder with seated figures representing a lyre player and a woman spinning. This is assigned to the second quarter of the eighth century. A rhyton ending in a life-like sheep's head is deco- rated in the developed red-figured style, with a youth following a maiden; two Melian reliefs, one from Koropi - showing a lyre player and a bearded man, of the known type er- roneously called Sappho and Alcaeus, dated about 470 B.c., with well pre- served white slip and red paint beneath the chair. 1he second relief is from Thasos and is dated about 460 B.C. Although it has lost its painted surface, it is otherwise well preserved and shows a hitherto unknown type with Aktaion and Artemis; the former is attacked by two dogs and is bent far forward with his club in his right hand-above his brow are slight indications of antlers. Artemis approaches from the right, en- couraging the bounds. Professor Sotiriadis excavated again at Marathon in the summer of 1934, confining his work to the necropolis of the ancient city where he cleared a group of large, carefully built cist graves of the Geometric pericd as well as others as late as the third century B.c. His most important work was the uncover- ing of a Mycenaean tholos tomb which had remained practically intact. Al- though this had been marked on the Curtius-Kaupert maps as a crescent or semi-circle, no one had understood its meaning and the peasants, fortunately, had thought it a disused limekiln. The tomb lies in the flat plain between Mt. Agrieliki and Mt. Cotroni and differs from other Mycenaean tholos tombs in not being cut into the slope of a hill. It appears to have been built in a large excavation dug down into the soil of the r?:- :: : : :::- : ::: ;- :: :?: :::: :::: :::::::_:? ::::::::i::j ::ij :-:::-:,-:_i-- --L_?:::: ' ::-:: --?~:-i-i~i:~:-i;_i'::l-i'i?i ?-::'--::-ii::i-ii--i--i-i~--::--:i'':- ::-::j-:::1:::.-:: :__-:-_: -::::: --?:?-i-;::::'::::':::--:-:-:::`:::::-:: -:?::-:-:-:-:-:(:-::-::::::-:::-:?::?: ?;:::::::-??::-:--:;~-:;-:;:::::::::-::j :::?:?:::_:::_::::-:--:-:--:j-:-::_i -. i::j: :::::-:-.:__-:?-i-?-----i_::ji:::-:: :?:::_i?i~~iii_:siii::ii_~i~i:-ii:: i:-i-i`i~r::-j:-:-B_,__-:j:j-:_?::-_:.: ,1:1~::7:~---~_::--:--:-~i~i-i -:::::i: :i:l_::':j:i_:::.:;::iii : ):-::-::--_-j_::_:~i_*~-i~i_~~~ri-i__:ii :-:::::::?:: :: ...:. ::::::::-:::::-:-i-:j::-i:-:~~j:::-?: i:-i-i::::::ji::- ~I--~ -::~~--~--'-::~---~--ir:j~~~~ ~s~i'a~;::'::'~i--;?UBi:i: --~-~-:/-:j?~~::~: ~:~:~::::1/1::~::::::i;:~ __ : ,:: j::;::-j: -.;:: :::j:: :-.:,-~~~,j-:i-~~:---:~i-i~~ii~,i~i~-~~ -~--~, -::::~~-I :j:":i:j:::1-)~:~::::j:::::::~?:-::::::- i::::: :::::1:: ;-lti;i:i"i~i ::liii-iiiiii:-iieii:l -:::::::::?;::::: j:::il: -:-::_:-:-:::::ji:::::: ::::: :::-':: '::::::-::-: -":-::--::- ;I:--: : -'iii?i liii-ii~~~~iijiii-i-i::_~i -I:iii:~.iiiR: ~i:~iE:i::i::--i:';-:-j:::::::: -::j:-i"c:?:i:$~:~~__:_~ ::ii'ii::i?i:i:i~iii:i~iiii~ii:i iii''i:iii?i:i:i---i- iiii~- ii;.ii~iiii`i;ii-i: ::: :-: :I::_:::::-:::: --. :I'~:::: ~::-; --~-_:--:::: ::: -_::i?:::'l:-i-: :~:~:::::: :i:::?-:::-:-;:::: ~= ~d~i?~~~~es~~~j:~cu: :_:,;=::::i:::::I i .,:_.. i'-:i:i:i:iiii~i:-:ia? -i?i?i:i---i:-- ii:iiji:i:i:i:i?i:i-iiiiiiiiiiiii :i- i-i-i:i-i-iii~i~ I: ~~::~B::;:~; cii~i:i~i~i~ .i:i:----:-~- iai: : :-.i:i:i- i-ii:i-i-i :::: -i:ii?~ii-i:i-~i-i -:- ::::: ::::: ::-:- -:-:-' i:,ii i?i-i~::i:~i-i:%iiii:i-ii i-i-i- -i-i i ;i:i:-i-iii-i~ :i?iiiiiiiii-~ai~i : iii-:i- ii?:is ii:i :-: :. :_::1::j: ::: :_:-:::j? :.-:_i::: ::-:::::1:: .i:--i---i-i:ii:ii ?::::------- iiiii-iiiiii::i.::i:~~i:i - ?:.?:--_:::::-?--?-__-:-:_-:-_-_:: ::::: -:: -:--:?:::-; a. :--:- :ii.i i-iii-iii~l~~ i-i-iiiiii-iiiilliii -:-:::- : -i:li:i~-i- iiiliii iiili :.. i:iiii:i-iiii-iiiiiiiiili i ::iI;::;:::::- :-::--::: i:iiiiiiii ii~i-~iiis~iiiii :::-:-:__:_:-_: .:: ..... i::-?_?'- -:-- ::: ::-i -:- -:-?:--:I:- : :-:?:? .:--: :.: ::::: :::: iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:i?i-F-i-i - ::: ::-:_'::~::::: :: iii:l::iii:-:,iii~iii~i;i ii~i:iii--i:--i~( :::iiiiiiiii~iiiiiii i---i-i-iii:i--:-i .: -ii:~i-:i-_:- --_:_i i~8ii;~i : :::: ::::: ..::.. -:- :: : :-: .. .: ~--- -? --il-: :. iii-ii:il~ -i-i-i;i i:ii~iiii~~-i-B a- -,~,ii~~ii ::: :: _? _~--::-----: ii _iii?iiiiiii~ii- iii i-i:i-i-i-i-:i:i-i- ;: :::::-?---::"i:-_--:::::: FIG. 1.--ATHENS, NATIONAL MUSEUM.

GOLD CUP FROM THOLOS TOMB AT MARATHON (Courtesy of Professor Sotiriadis)</page><page sequence="17">134 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY an engineer, Professor Sotiriadis cleared almost all of the tholos chamber and two cist graves found in its floor. The first of these was 24 cm. deep and contained one skeleton holding a gold cup in the bend of his arm (Fig. 4). The cup is of the low shallow type with a ribbon handle and measures ca. 10 cm. in diameter. It is in perfect condition. Fragments of Mycenaean vases were also found in the grave. The sides of the grave were lined with stones upon which rested the cover slabs, but there was no slab nor even pebbles at the bottom. The second burial was found near the north side of the tholos and contained in addition to the skeleton some badly decomposed bronzes. Above the floor of the tholos was a thick layer of ash and above that a fill of burned bones and earth and stones in which were mingled many Mycenaean and unpainted sherds. The unprece- dented rainfall has made it necessary to postpone work on the tomb until the spring when Professor Sotiriadis hopes to complete the clearing of the tholos itself and to investigate the dromos. One of the most noteworthy discoveries of re- cent years was made by chance in a cave three hours back from the railway station of Pitsa (44 kin. west of Corinth) where a peasant found a number of painted wooden tablets or pinakes. The wood used for the tablets is cypress and the colors are held with white of egg. Four have the colors still remarkably preserved and although three of them are broken at the edges, the re- maining surface has not been damaged; the fourth is almost completely preserved and measures 15 cm. x 33 cm. It must have been p1ainted in Corinth soon after the middle of the sixth century. It shows a procession of worshippers coming from the left, bringing offerings to an altar at the extreme right. A priestess comes first with a jug in her right hand and a large flat basket of offerings on her head. Behind her a small boy is leading a sheep, two larger boys play the flute and lyre and beyond are two more women with branches and fillets in their right hands and their left hands stretched out flat. Their names are inscribed beside them. Next comes a bearded man entirely wrapped in a blue mantle and carrying a branch. The background is white, the figures outlined in black paint, the faces of the women have a rose-red outline and the boy's a light brown. The undergarments are blue, the mantles are red or dark brown. The inscription, in archaic Corinthian characters, says that the tablet was dedicated to the Nymphs and that it was painted by a Corinthian whose name un- fortunately has been broken away. The purity and simple harmony of the colors and the fine- ness of the drawing give us some idea of what has been lost by the non-survival of Corinthian paint- ing. A second tablet may have represented a somewhat similar scene, while in two others the figures are larger and are placed one behind the other filling the whole field of the tablet, which in this case is higher than it is broad. The parts extant show the skirts and feet only. The women wear long embroidered skirts in bright blue or brilliant red with elaborate designs used in the borders. One figure holds an animal in her right hand. The pinakes belong to different painters: one is rather Early Archaic and the others Later Archaic in style. The archaeological authorities undertook systematic digging in the cave and Mr. Mitsos found quantities of terracottas, vase fragments, and many small whole pots dating from the sixth to the fourth century B.C. These supplementary researches produced also a statue group in wood with one standing and one seated figure, both draped and very square in outline. The heads are missing. This measures about 18-20 cm. high now but originally may have been 25-30 cm. in height. There is no color preserved. Some plain pieces of wood were also found as well as some bronzes, including two plain mirrors and a Greek lamp, and three small fafence vases (Cf. above, p. 5). At Arkalochori in Crete an archaeological dis- covery of unusual importance was made this last summer. A cave on the hill of the Prophet Elias above the village, which is in the eastern part of the Mesara' about 32 km. from Candia, had been known for over a century at least as a profitable source from which peasants acquired ancient bronze ex-votos which they sold by weight in the neighboring villages. In 191Q2, the Ephor, Mr. Hazzidakis, undertook excavations in the cave, but did not penetrate beyond a fall of rock which he took to be the wall of the cave. He brought back to the Museum some Early Minoan pottery and bronze votive double axes which at that time were considered comtemporary.m For more than twenty years nothing more was heard of the cave until this past summer when some children found a gold double axe lying in the earth thrown out by a rabbit in making his hole. The entire village soon heard of it and following the line taken by the rabbit they came upon a rich deposit B.S.A.

The archaeological service eventually managed made with a hollow into which were set carefully worked pieces of lead as shafts with a small ring of gold wire at the top for suspension (P1.

It was found that the rock fall had divided the cave into three long narrow grottoes, the fall probably having been caused by an earth- quake in L.M. II and the cave no longer used, since no pottery was found within the cave later than Middle Minoan (a few E.M. sherds and intact small handleless cups of the usual M.M. type) and the dec- oration on the double axes belongs to the type which furnished the inspiration for the second period of Palace Style pottery, ca. 1450-1400 B.c.1 But Arkalochori was not entirely forgotten and offerings were brought to the entrance of the cave down to the end of the Minoan period and perhaps later, as is proved by the late sherds found on the slope outside the cave. The ex-votos which have been taken to the Museum in Candia include six or seven double axes in silver and more than twenty- five in gold. These gold axes range from 2 cm. to 4 cm. or at most 8.5 cm. in breadth and are The largest, 9 cm. in height and 8.5 cm. wide, weights 19.5 grams. The heaviest weighs 21.5 grams.

Some bronze was found in unworked form, having apparently been dedi- cated to the god in rounded ingots like cakes. From the evidence now at hand it would appear that the cult of Arkalochori began as early as the third millennium but only the pottery can be as- signed to this early period, the height of the cult falling in the seventeenth, sixteenth, and fifteenth centuries. Mr. Marinatos, the Ephor, brings up the question as to whether this may not have been the famous cave of Zeus where Rhea hid him from Saturn, since in some respects this cave meets the description of Hesiod better than the Dictaean Cave. It is true that Arkalochori is on the summit of a hill rather than a lofty mountain, but it is distant only one and a half hours from Lyktos (modern Castelli Pediados), which He- siod I mentions as being in the vicinity of the cave, while the Psychro cave is more than four hours distant.
