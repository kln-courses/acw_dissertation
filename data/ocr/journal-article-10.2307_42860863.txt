Recent edition: New York: The Modern Library, 1934.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 219 LOUIS SCHNEIDER University of Texas at Austin Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class appeared originally in 1899 and has been issued under the imprint of several publishers. The most recent pub- lisher, to the reviewer's knowledge, is Houghton Mifflin, which put out the book (in a rather decorative format that might not have pleased Veblen greatly) in 1973, with an introduction by J. K. Galbraith. The Modern Library edition is used here as a matter of convenience. The phrases of The Theory of the Leisure Class still evoke memories of the pungency they possesed for the re- viewer on a first reading decades ago. If one can no longer roar with laughter, one can still chuckle or nod apprecia- tively over "a certain amiable ineffi- ciency when confronted with force or fraud," "the requirement of a substan- tial and patent waste of time/' "blood which has been ennobled by protracted contact with accumulated wealth or un- broken prerogative," "an unremitting demonstration of the ability to pay," "strict exclusion of the appearance of thrift," "the anthropomorphic appre- hension of the sequence of phenomena." And of course there are "conspicuous consumption" and "pecuniary decency" and "pecuniary emulation," as well as numerous other sharp, diverting and ingenious combinations of words that bear the mark of Veblen. As truly as of virtually any writer, one may say of him that no one knowing him could fail to recognize his hand in even a few consecutive sentences actually of his composition. It is a shrewd observation that Veblen treats the pecuniary element in social life in a way that resembles older psy- cho-analytical treatments of sex. This book might have been entitled The Pervasive Character of the Pecuniary Itch and Some of Its More Surprising Rami- fications. Of course, one must not psy- chologize Veblen unduly. He does have certain psychological interests, but the style of his book is generally sociologi- cal and he thought of himself as an economist. The alternative title sug- gested would still not be excessively misleading. Pecuniary emulation is in- deed pervasive. It ramifies subtly into fields of conduct where one would not ordinarily expect it. It provides itself with covers- fig-leaves, one might say- which the able analyst mercilessly re- moves. The Veblen who exhibits the scope and force of the pecuniary element re- veals a great deal. It is unoriginal yet surely true to say that phenomena like dress and architecture can never strike one in the same way after one reads Veblen on them. But Veblen also over- plays his hand, much as orthodox Freudians overplayed theirs in handling sexuality and its ramifications. How much does the pecuniary imputation re- veal, for instance, in the sphere of religion, of what Veblen called "devout observances"? Something, no doubt, but it is easy to generate strong reservations about the matter. Veblen has hardly been the only economist or sociologist to be concerned with "economic" as- pects of religion. Max Weber had a similar concern, but Weber's treatment of religion represents a level of knowl- edge and sophistication that makes Veb- len look trivially clever at best. Is it really flatly true that, as Veblen says, "the consumption of goods and effort in the service of an anthropomorphic di- vinity means a lowering of the vitality of the community"? The whole functional approach to re- ligion (whatever its limitations) reveals dimensions and consequences of its ac- tion that Veblen would not or could not consider. It does Veblen's case no good whatever, whether in religion or else- where, to say, as he does, in his con- texts, that he is only speaking from a strictly "economic" point of view and does not pretend to settle "moral" or "aesthetic" questions pertaining to the</page><page sequence="3">220 Social Science Quarterly phenomena he discusses. This is quite threadbare and suggests that Veblen is engaging in tomfoolery, for it is clear from other statements of his own that he would be disposed to reduce the "moral' or "aesthetic" aspects of vari- ous "institutions" he discusses to mere prejudices that reflect a "barbarian" or a "predatory" culture or the like. What isn't "economic," in one way or another, reduces to "waste" or economic damage -or else to dim reverberations thereof in the head, in the consciousness. It is also extremely doubtful whether what Veblen calls waste in the "economic" respect is always waste in the "eco- nomic" respect, if one looks with a vision other than that afforded by Veb- len's resolutely one-eyed stare. This book is not characterized by much respect for evidence. Its anthro- pology is casual and somewhat vague and often gives the impression of being a homemade product designed to sup- port Veblen's special crotchets. There is a bit of foolishness about "dolicho bloods/ Veblen is not always very neat conceptually. The term "institutions" is herewith in this review set down in quo- tation marks for the second time, to stress Veblen's rather loose way with it. Really careful delineation of stratifica- tion schemes instead of Veblen's "po- etic" approach to them would have been helpful. But perhaps one should not ask too much on the lines thus intimated from a book that does indeed have a poetic quality and an authentic measure of poetic power. In any case, if it has shortcomings, The Theory of the Leisure Class has nevertheless impressed some thinkers of stature. Although Schumpeter did not have high regard for Veblen as an econ- omist, he characterized The Theory of the Leisure Class as a work of "consid- erable importance" in his own major History of Economic Analysis. Veblen's book was favorably reviewed around the time of its appearance by the sociolo- gist Lester Frank Ward and by the novelist William Dean Howells. The im- pact of the book has extended to theater and to arts more generally, as well as to social science- and it extends into the present century. Joseph Dorfman re- views its intellectual influence at some length in his introduction to the col- lection of Veblen's Essays , Reviews and Reports published by Augustus M. Kelley in 1973, and one of the more striking circumstances in its intellec- tual history noted by Dorfman is that Kenneth Boulding, in his presidential address to the American Economic As- sociation in 1968, in Dorfman's words, "forthrightly revised his estimate of Veblen and in effect called attention to the basic role of the book in the devel- opment of economic dynamics." In so- ciology, it is worth noting that Robert K. Merton, in his seminal paper on manifest and latent functions, made sig- nificant use of what amounts to the Veb- lenian contrast between a "latent equa- tion," in which costliness of goods is a mark of higher status, and a "mani- fest equation," in which costliness ar- gues excellence of quality; and Merton retained his discussion of Veblen in the paper referred to, which found a place in all three editions of Merton's famous Social Theory and Social Structure (the third and to-date last edition of which appeared in 1968). That The Theory of the Leisure Class had a more than intellectual impact on American culture-and-society in particu- lar is also beyond doubt. The book changed the minds and ways of people far outside the academy. It is hard to be highly precise about this, but the very least one can say is that pertinent impressionistic evidence lends support to a statement such as David Riesman ( 1960 ) made in his study of Veblen, that Veblen "would be surprised at the impact his views have had on the edu- cated rich themselves, for whom many of his phrases have been translated into</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 221 what is virtually a set of sumptuary laws." Vehlen himself saw signs of miti- gation of conspicuous consumption in a portion of the leisure class in his own day and refers to the matter in his book. But the book itself is a striking example of one of those intellectual products that get into the stream of what they dis- cuss and affect the character of the waters. The Theory of the Leisure Class influenced that very conspicuous con- sumption it purported so detachedly to discuss. Who, engaged in conspicuous con- sumption but possessed of rudimentary sensitivity, could fail to wince at Veb- len's phrases, however transmited to him? It may well be that The Theory of the Leisure Class is a book that is worth another book yet to be written about it- another book which would ex- plore its influence in America thorough- ly and systematically and thereby make a contribution to the history and so- ciology of American culture. There is a fair number of studies of Veblen, some of book length. In time, there may well be more. But a study of the kind alluded to would be something quite different from the usual discussions of Veblen's thought. Some last words of comment on that thought and the one who pro- duced it may be allowed. Thorstein Veblen was a highly talented man but also a rather perverse one. The Theory of the Leisure Class, perhaps his major work, is a curious combination of power- ful insights and jaundiced, arbitrary in- terpretations. As an economist Veblen stimulated inquiry into a number of matters that were certainly worth in- quiring into but he also contributed confusion when he misunderstood im- portant aspects of the basic analytical enterprise of his field, as he was unhap- pily capable of doing. It would be un- fair and a bit cheap merely to say that he represents a triumph of cleverness over wisdom, but he comes close enough to this, and does so often enough, that it is at any rate well to be decidedly wary in estimating his significance in the history of his own formal discipline or of allied ones.
