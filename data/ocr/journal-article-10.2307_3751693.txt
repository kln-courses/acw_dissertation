And that means the pictorial or internal relation cannot be the same as structural correspondence. Confusion becomes especially apparent, however, in Peterson's absolute distinction between what belongs to the mirror and what is reflected in it, between what belongs to language and what to the world. For him, 'logical properties or relations are to be found not in the world, but in language' (p. 103). But for Wittgenstein, at this time, the distinction would have made no kind of sense. Logic is independent of what happens to be so in the world. But the world has an order which does not just happen to be so. And to suppose that logic is independent of that order, to suppose in other words that there is no fundamental connection between the world and language, is to suppose that logic is quite arbitrary. It is a sign of Peterson's confusion on this point that he treats the earlier sections of the Tractatus, which are concerned with language and the world, as though they were superfluous. He even supposes what would have been abhorrent to Wittgenstein, that the Tractatus contains two different logics, one concerning the logical constants, which is truth functional, and the other concerning the pictorial relation. The earlier sections in fact are vitally import- ant. Without the pictorial relation between language and the world there can be no logic at all. In other words, there can be no logic unless there is a fundamental connection between language and the world. Similarly, although Peterson often repeats Wittgenstein's fundamental thought that the logical constants do not represent, he misses what is fundamental in it. He takes the thought to be that logic belongs to language as distinct from the world. But Wittgenstein's point is that the relation between language and the world, and therefore logic itself, cannot be represented. It can only show itself. But what shows itself is precisely that there is a fundamental connection between language and the world. The confusion that the Tractatus attacks is not that logic belongs to the world as distinct from language. The confusion rather is to suppose that if there is a fundamental connection between language and the world, it must be capable of being represented and explained. For Wittgenstein, this is to confuse what is represented or explained with what makes it possible to explain or represent. The relation between language and the order of the words cannot be explained or represented because it is presupposed in everything we repre- sent or explain. Had Peterson grasped this point he could not have attempted, in an epilogue, to show that there is a kinship between the Tractatus and cognitive science. Between cognitive science and the Tractatus there is the greatest conceivable distance. H. O. Mounce A World of Propensities By Karl R. Popper Thoemmes Antiquarian Books Ltd., 64 pp., ?5.00 paper This is a delightful little book. It is the printed version of two lectures in which Popper presents some novel developments of his earlier views. The writing has 392</page><page sequence="2">New Books all the clarity and interest of Popper at his best, so that this book is really essential reading for anyone interested in philosophy. Popper introduced a new theory of probability known as the propensity theory of probability in 1956. This theory has given rise to a great deal of fruitful discussion among those interested in the technical aspects of proba- bility. In the first lecture of this book, however, Popper generalizes the theory so that it becomes a cosmological view of much wider philosophical interest. In particular Popper criticizes determinism from this new perspective. As he says (pp. 17-18): Past situations, whether physical or psychological or mixed, do not deter- mine the future situation. Rather they determine changingpropensities that influence future situations without determining them in a unique way. In particular the traditional notion of causation turns out to be a special case of propensity, in which the propensity is equal to one (p. 20). From this point of view Popper defends free will, and the claim that (p. 18): 'the future is open: objectively open.' In the second lecture: 'Towards an Evolutionary Theory of Knowledge', Popper casts new light on the old philosophical subject of epistemology by considering the possibility that animals, and even plants, have knowledge. This idea is introduced as follows (p. 30): ... my starting point is a very simple proposition-indeed, an almost trivial one-the proposition that animals can know something: that they can have knowledge. For example, a dog may know that his master returns home, on working days, at about 6 p.m., and the behaviour of the dog may give many indications, clear to his friends, that he expects the return of his master at that time. This view may seem anthropomorphic, but, Popper argues, we all assume that dogs have noses. This also is anthropomorphic, but yet correct. It can be fitted into the theory of evolution by conjecturing that a dog's nose and a human nose are homologous i.e. that they are both inherited from a distant common ancestor. In the same way Popper conjectures that the dog's brain has a function homologous to the biological function of human knowledge. Popper goes on later to ask (p. 35): 'Can only animals know? Why not plants?' He then argues that plants can indeed know, for example (p. 35): 'Trees know that they may find much-needed water by pushing their roots into deeper layers of the earth; . . .' Continuing this line of thought, Popper extends knowledge to even the most primitive forms of life, and concludes, very reasonably from this point of view, that (p. 39): 'the problem of know- ledge becomes a problem of cosmology.' Popper's view that all living things can have knowledge is certainly stimulat- ing and thought-provoking, but the present reviewer does not find it altogether convincing. While it may be possible to attribute knowledge to pet dogs, it does seem rather implausible to attribute knowledge to trees or unicellular organ- isms. But is there then any approach to knowledge which can prevent us sliding down Popper's slippery slope to the lowest life forms? I will next suggest one possibility. 393</page><page sequence="3">New Books An important point to note is that Popper always attributes knowledge to an individual organism e.g. Albert Einstein, or a particular dog. Thus on p. 38, he speaks of 'knowledge of an organism, from the unicellular amoeba to Albert Einstein, .. .' (my italics). By contrast I would like to suggest that knowledge should be attributed primarily to a social group, and only to an individual qua member of a social group. Thus knowledge would have to be of such a kind that it could be transmitted from one member of the group to another. One reason for this approach is that it allows us to follow Popper in making criticism and testing part of the knowledge process. I may have a belief or expectation, but it can only become knowledge if it is put in a form in which it can be publicly criticized and tested. In general, an individual will not be able effectively to criticize his or her own beliefs. Criticism only becomes a reality when it becomes a social and public process. Popper suggests that two of the most important values for the evolution of knowledge are a self-critical attitude and truth (p. 50). Here I would suggest replacing 'self-critical attitude' by 'readiness to listen to the criticisms of others'. Other people are much better than we are at perceiving the faults in ourselves, or our beliefs. If we apply this social analysis of knowledge, it becomes at once clear that plants and unicellular organisms can have expectations but not knowledge. For example an oak cannot communicate its expectations to another oak, and still less can one oak criticize the direction in which another oak is searching for water. On the other hand it might be possible to attribute knowledge to a pet dog, because such a dog does occupy a place, albeit a humble one, in human society. Thus, to pursue Popper's example, suppose a guest infers from the dog's agitation at 5.50 p.m. that his master will return soon. The guest can check whether this is indeed so. Is it however possible to attribute knowledge to animals apart from the case of human pets? There do seem to be some instances where this might plausibly be done even on the present social view of knowledge. The most obvious example is bees. As we know, a bee can find out that there is a source of nectar at such and such a distance from the hive in such and such a direction. Moreover this information can be communicated to the other members of the hive by the bee dances. These other members can then check whether the information is correct by going to the place specified to see whether nectar is indeed to be found at that spot. Of course both the bees' language, and their ability to test and criticize, are very limited when com- pared to those of human societies, but there is enough of an analogy here in my view to justify attributing knowledge to bees. Thus the suggested social analysis of knowledge still results in attributing knowledge to some animals, but the line is drawn in a different place from the one suggested by Popper. Wherever the truth lies, there is no doubt that Popper has raised some very interesting questions for epistemologists, and it is to be hoped that his book will stimulate discussion of these questions among philosophers.
