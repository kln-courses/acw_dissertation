<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST BY P. L. CARVER THE passage in the Ninth Book of Paradise Lost where Milton speaks of the " celestial patroness" who dictates in nightly visita- tions his " unpremeditated verse "1 is quoted by Shelley 2 to prove that the true poet is the passive vehicle of an inspiration outside himself, and has no real responsibility for his utterances. No one can doubt the genuineness of Milton's conviction that he was divinely aided in a task beyond human power, but he would not have applied to himself the statement that poets are " the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire." The responsibility for the management of his intellect remained his own, and it was only by discharging that responsibility faithfully that he hoped to make himself worthy to receive the prophetic gift. Whether his natural genius was always subordinate to his inspiration or whether it some- times went its own way in the absence of the " celestial patroness " is a question of wide scope, upon which much has been written. I propose to consider it here with particular reference to the angels. According to orthodox theology, with which the heavenly Muse might be expected generally to agree, an angel is a discarnate spirit having only intellect and will. Could such a being be made comprehensible in poetry, and, if not, what alternative was possible ? The difficulty must have confronted Milton at a very early stage. It was not merely that he was writing for a scholarly and highly critical audience: an audience, as he said, fit though few. The scholar would be aware that it was in the nature of poetry to present truth under the guise of fiction, and would be willing to accept an anthropomorphic angel as an imaginative symbol of the real angel. Spenser would have settled the problem so easily as hardly to be aware of its existence; and Professor Hanford, whose authority must be respected, considers that Milton, like Spenser, simply 1 P. L., IX. 21-4. ' See the Defence of Poetry. 415</page><page sequence="2">416 R. E. S., VOL. 16, 1940 (N9 64, OCT.) adopted the recognized convention. " Certainly," he says in a recent article: : he regarded his imaginings as something more than poetic fancy, but equally certainly he did not accept or wish others to accept their detail as literal, historic fact. We can easily reconstruct the reasoning by which Milton supported or would have supported such an attitude. It is again Platonic. The world of fact is but the image of a reality incompre- hensible to men. The poet's function is to embody truth in symbolic images. Milton is explicit in this idea as applied to the detail of the war in Heaven: for how shall I relate To human sense the invisible exploits Of warring spirits ? Actually it is the angel who says this, and that fact, as I hope to show, may have had a certain influence in determining the form of the narration; but, whether he speaks in his own character or in any other, he will not have it supposed that he is merely inventing parables : though what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein Each to other like more than on Earth is thought ? 2 When Milton describes the first appearance of the angel to Adam and Eve is it to be understood that the human attributes of this majestic being are symbols, or images, as Professor Hanford would say, " of a reality incomprehensible to men "? Milton's management of the scene leaves us in no doubt that he had considered the question, and had decided that he could, without transgressing literal truth, allow the angel to have a real, though ethereal, body. Adam invites his guest to a meal; the angel accepts willingly, answering an apparent doubt in Adam's mind by the assurance that food alike those pure Intelligential substances require As doth your Rational."

L., V. 433-8.</page><page sequence="3">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 417 A small discovery which has come my way by a fortunate chance may help to make these lines more intelligible. The general inten- tion is clear enough. " For several of the Fathers and ancient Doctors," says Newton, who first expounded it, were of opinion, that the Angels did not really eat, but only seemed to do so ; and they ground that opinion principally upon what the Angel Raphael says in the book of Tobit, xii. 19. All these days did I appear unto you, but I did neither eat nor drink, but you did see a vision. But our author was of the contrary opinion, that the Angel did not eat in appearance only but in reality, with keen dispatch of real hunger as he says.x That accounts for the denial that the angel only " seemingly " took his share, but there remains the addition, " nor in mist." That, I think, may have been suggested by a passage in the Reportata Parisiensia of Duns Scotus, where the question how, why, and under what conditions the angels sometimes come down to earth in human shape is considered at some length. We are told that an angel appearing in an assumed body, though he may masticate and swallow, does not assimilate the food so taken, as he has no need of nutriment ; he exhales it in the form of fumes or clouds.2 Reading them against this background, we must interpret Milton's words as an emphatic repudiation of every conclusion deducible from " the common gloss," and particularly of the conclusion elaborated by Duns Scotus. Though it may be of finer mould and accustomed to more delicate fare, the angel's body is no less real in itself and no less dependent on food of some kind than a body of flesh and blood. It is impossible to believe that Milton would have gone out of his way to sneer in this manner at the opinion of " theologians " if he had been willing to concede that his downright assertion was only poetically true. Milton the poet is guided at this point by the rational mind of Milton the man. It is not surprising that Milton the man should have rejected " the common gloss," for in De Doctrina Christiana he comes dangerously near to approving the conception of an anthropomorphic God. " If," he asks, " God be said 'to have made man in his own image, after his like- 1 Paradise Lost, ed.

"1 Sumner, in his editorial note, is anxious that Milton should guard himself " against the charge of having adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the Church," but seems to hope rather than believe that he has actually done so. I am not sure whether any attempt has been made to discover how far Milton was influenced by Tertullian. It could be said of Tertullian, as Professor Sewell says of Milton, that he was " sternly logical and adventurous in logic, but not profoundly philosophical."2 He combined the fervour of a Hebrew prophet with Roman stolidity and high seriousness. Like Milton, he repudiated the " theologians " of his time, and followed his own independent course until, at the end of his life, he was almost a sect unto himself. In De Doctrina Christiana Milton quotes his authority for the doctrine that the human soul is "propagated from father to son in a natural order,"3 and in his account of the creation there are signs of indebtedness to Tertullian's treatise Adversus Hermogenem. Tertullian is opposed to the theory that the world was formed out of pre-existing matter, but reproduces the arguments of Hermogenes in order to refute them. Here Milton is on the side of Hermogenes; but he refuses, like Tertullian, to identify matter with the principle of evil, and it may have been with conscious recognition that Tertullian is right on this point that he turns aside to add: " For the original matter of which we speak, is not to be looked upon as an evil or trivial thing, but as intrinsically good, and the chief productive stock of every subsequent good."4 Tertullian not only ascribed a certain corporeal substance to the soul 5 but asserted in plain terms that God himself has a bodily form. " For who will deny," he says, " that God is a body, although ' God is a Spirit'? For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own form."6 It is natural, therefore, that, in his view, 1 Milton's Works, Columbia edn., vol. xIv, p. 35. 2 A Study of Milton's Christian Doctrine, p. 82. 3 Milton's Works (Columbia edn.), vol. xv, p. 43. 4 Ibid., p. 23. 6 De Anima, V. 6 Adversus Praxean, VII (English translation Ante-Nicene Christian Library, vol. xv, p. 346). This and the preceding chapters have some apparent relevance</page><page sequence="5">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 419 the angels should be corporeal beings even in their ordinary state, and that the bodies in which they appear on earth should be real bodies of flesh and blood. Thus he denies that the angels who conversed with Abraham and Lot, and ate with them, were " in a phantom state, that of merely putative flesh "; the assumed body was " one of a true and solid human substance," for, he argues, " it is more difficult for God to practise deception than to produce real flesh from any material whatever, even without the means of birth."' To this is added the interesting remark that the change may be reversed. God, we are told, who once formed angels into men, " has promised that He will one day form men into angels." The statement has, at first sight, a certain similarity to St. Augustine's doctrine that men were created to fill the places in Heaven left vacant by the fallen angels, which doctrine is also reproduced by Milton: to Him Glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained Good out of evil to create--instead Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to worlds and ages infinite." The Scriptural text to which St. Augustine appeals is also quoted by Tertullian,3 but the latter's interpretation is clearly distinguish- able from that of orthodox theology. An angel may be a spiritual being, but to Tertullian spirit and soul are synonymous terms,4 to a question discussed by Professor Saurat (Milton : Man and Thinker, pp. 303-5) and Professor Sewell (A Study in Milton's Christian Doctrine, pp. 38-40) : whether the invocation beginning Book III of Paradise Lost is addressed to the Son or to physical light. Tertullian's view is that the words " Let there be light " mean that God made his Reason, or Word, manifest, and thus the Son was " begotten." 1 Adversus Marcionem (English Translation Ante-Nicene Christian Library, vol. vII, pp. 136-7). 2 P. L., VII. 186-91. Cp. St. Augustine, Enchiridion, Cap. xxix: " Placuit itaque universitatis creatori atque moderatori Deo, ut quoniam non tota multitudo angelorum Deum deserando perierat, ea qua perierat in perpetua perditione re- maneret; quae autem cum Deo illa deserente perstiterat, de sua certissime cogita semper futura felicitate gauderet : alia vero creatura rationalis que hominibus erat, quoniam peccatis atque suppliciis et originalibus et propriis tota perierat, ex eius parte reparata, quod angelice societati ruina illa diabolica minuerat, supplere- tur." Milton, of course, makes a departure in explaining in this way the creation of the world instead of the redemption of man. Cp. also with P. L., I. 162-5, and with the passage quoted in the text, Enchiridion, Cap. xxvii: " Melius enim iudicavit de malis bene facere, quam mala nulla esse permittere." " " They are equal unto the angels " (Luke xx. 36). " This is pointed out by the Ante-Nicene translators (Vol. xv, p. 346, note 5).</page><page sequence="6">420 R. E. S., VOL. 16, 1940 (N9 64, OCT.) and the soul is a corporeal substance; the transformation of men into angels, therefore, is nothing more than the exchange of the human body for a body more tenuous and ethereal, and adapted to a nobler habitation. This is the belief expressed by Milton when Adam is informed that Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit, Improved by tract of time, and wing'd ascend Ethereal, as we, or may at choice Here or in heavenly paradises dwell, If ye be found obedient, and retain Unalterably firm his love entire Whose progeny you are.' Professor Hanford traces this idea to a passage in Comus, and decides that it is one " which Milton is willing for the moment to retain without attempting to adjust it too precisely to his responsible Christian thinking." Read in the light of Tertullian's arguments, the idea is not alien to Milton's responsible Christian thinking; the difficulty is rather to reconcile Tertullian to St. Augustine. We seem to arrive safely at the conclusion that Milton's angels were formed on the model of Tertullian, and were imagined as, in all essentials, a higher race of men. That, however, is not the whole truth. There is another influence at work, and one with which the influence of Tertullian does not easily harmonize. Milton, as is well known, thought Spenser " a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas." Probably what he meant was that a certain kind of moral truth can be taught more effectually by picturesque allegory addressed to the imagination than by abstract reasoning addressed to the intellect. Milton would not have been a poet if he had not discovered that; but in Paradise Lost he was under a special obliga- tion to keep the literal truth clearly present to his own mind and to that of the reader, whatever devices he might use to illustrate it. If he repudiates " the common gloss " it is not because he finds it poetically difficult to follow; it is because he believes it to be untrue, and, as we have seen, he could have called in the evidence of Tertullian to support his opinion. On some other points, how- ever, he seems to have decided that the theologians were right. When he explains, in the character of Raphael, how Satan came to be expelled from Heaven, he writes almost as if he had had the Summa Theologica open before him. One of the few questions which St. Thomas Aquinas hesitates 1 P. L., V. 497-503.</page><page sequence="7">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 421 to decide with downright finality is whether Satan, before his fall, was the highest of the angels. That he was the highest " seems to be the more probable view: because the angels' sin did not come of any proneness, but of free choice alone. Consequently that argument seems to have the more weight which is drawn from the motive in sinning." 1 Milton reaches the same conclusion with similar hesitation: He of the first, If not the first Archangel, great in power, In favour, and pre-eminence, yet fraught With envy against the Son of God, that day Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed Messiah, King Anointed, could not bear Through pride, that sight, and thought himself impaired.2 Satan, then, was probably the highest of the angels, and certainly of the highest order. But the immediate interest of the passage just quoted is not confined to the first two lines. We are told in the continuation that Satan was moved to revolt " through pride," giving rise to " envy against the Son of God." That pride and envy were the sins which led to the fall of Satan is stated by St. Augustine,3 but St. Thomas Aquinas works it out clearly from first principles. An angel is a purely intellectual being, without any kind of body, and, therefore, without senses or imagination. " Now," it is argued, a spiritual nature cannot be affected by such pleasures as appertain to bodies, but only by such as are in keeping with spiritual things; because nothing is affected except with regard to something which is in some way suited to its nature. But there can be no sin when anyone is incited to good of the spiritual order ; unless in such affection the rule of the superior be not kept. Such is precisely the sin of pride-not to be subject to a superior where subjection is due. Consequently the first sin of the angel can be none other than pride. Yet, as a consequence, it was possible for envy also to be in them, since for the appetite to tend to the desire of something involves on its part resistance to anything contrary. Now the envious man repines 1 Summa Theologica, Pt. I, Q. 63, art. 7. (All quotations from St. Thomas Aquinas are from Part I of the Summa Theologica. The translation of the Fathers of the English Dominican Province has been used throughout.) 2 P. L., V. 659-65. 3 De Genesi ad Litteram, Lib. XI, cap. XIV. St. Augustine records the opinion of some that Satan fell from the highest place because he envied man, as being made in the image of God. Milton's version, in the poem, is that it was the exaltation of the Son, before the creation of man, which first excited Satan's envy. This is consistent with Milton's refusal to believe that the Son had existed as co-equal with the Father from all eternity.</page><page sequence="8">422 R. E. S., VOL. 16, 1940 (NQ 64, OCT.) over the good possessed by another inasmuch as he deems his neighbour's good to be a hindrance to his own. But another's good could not be deemed a hindrance to the good coveted by the wicked angel, except inasmuch as he coveted a singular excellence, which would cease to be singular because of the excellence of some other. So, after the sin of pride, there followed the sin of envy in the sinning angel, whereby he grieved over man's good, and also over the Divine excellence, according as against the devil's will God makes use of man for the Divine glory.1 The sin of pride led Satan to desire, in a certain sense, equality with God. It is asserted by St. Thomas that " without doubt the angel sinned by seeking to be as God," though with certain quali- fications. He did not desire to be himself God, for " no creature of a lower order can ever covet the grade of a higher nature ; just as an ass does not desire to be a horse." Nor did he desire only to be Godlike so far as his own nature would allow, for that would be commendable. " But," we are told, he desired resemblance with God in this respect--by desiring, as his last end of beatitude, something which he could attain by the virtue of his own nature, turning his appetite away from supernatural beatitude, which is attained by God's grace. Or, if he desired as his last end that likeness of God which is bestowed by grace, he sought to have it by the power of his own nature; and not from Divine assistance according to God's ordering. . . . He sought to have final beatitude of his own power, whereas this is proper to God alone. St. Thomas concludes with the remark that since " what exists of itself is the cause of what exists of another, it follows from this furthermore that he sought to have dominion over others; wherein he also perversely wished to be like unto God."2 All this is expressed at the beginning of Paradise Lost: what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equalled the most High, If he opposed.3 Throughout the poem Satan claims to be equal to God in the sense of having " final beatitude of his own power " : Our puissance is our own, our own right hand Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try Who is our equal.4 1 S.

L., V. 861-3.</page><page sequence="9">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 423 He also claims " to have dominion over others," or " to set himself in Glory above his Peers." The second of these ambitions, in the poem as in St. Thomas's argument, arises from the first by natural consequence, though it differs from the first in being easily attainable. Even while proposing the original revolt, Satan is careful to remind his followers that orders and degrees Jar not with liberty, but well consist.' When he has decided upon his plan of revenge, at the council of Pandemonium, he deliberately arranges the manner of his departure so that towards him they bend With awful reverence prone, and as a God Extol him to the Highest in Heaven.' There is an interesting contrast in Paradise Lost between the way in which Satan addresses himself to beings of his own order of creation and the way in which an angel, good or bad, addresses himself to man. Here again Milton seems to follow the theologians. An angel is not to be convinced by a logical demonstration, for he understands by direct intuition, without the use of symbols. As he has no bodily senses, he cannot be deluded by pleasant sights and sounds; nor would it be possible, as he has no imagination,3 to tempt him by drawing verbal pictures of the happiness to be attained by consenting to the course proposed. When, therefore, Satan drew after him a third part of the Heavens, he could not have, in our sense, persuaded the others to follow. Nor could he compel them, though he could exercise a certain influence as their natural superior, He induced them, according to St. Thomas, " by a kind of exhortation. A token thereof appears in this, that all the demons are subjects of that highest one."4 It is precisely in this manner that Satan makes his appeal to "his next subordinate " in the lines beginning " Sleep'st thou, companion dear ? "6 The tone is that of a person accustomed to expect obedience, but aware, on this occasion, that he has no power to enforce it. The speech must have been difficult to compose, for a poet is at a disadvantage when he deprives himself of the use 1P. L., V. 789-90. 2 P. L., II. 477-9. 8 S. T., Q. 54, art. 5 ; Q. 55, art. 2. ' S.

Milton, one imagines, was glad to allow Satan the excuse that more in this place To utter is not safe, and to describe the general effect in his own words: So spake the false Archangel, and infused Bad influence into the unwary breast Of his associate." The reader is left with the impression of " a kind of exhortation " delivered in the tone of a command. When, on the other hand, the communication is from angel to man instead of from a greater to a lesser angel, different conditions are to be observed. The angel, though he does not himself make use of phantasmata, or mental imagery, knows that the human mind is incapable of reasoning in any other way. We cannot, for example, theorize about the properties of a triangle unless we either have the visible form of a triangle before our eyes or recall, by means of the imagination, a triangle such as we have formerly seen. " Any- one," says St. Thomas, " can experience this of himself, that when he tries to understand something, he forms certain phantasms to serve him by way of examples, in which as it were he examines what he is desirous of understanding." It is also by recalling phantasmata of concrete and visible things that we understand the abstract and invisible. " Incorporeal things, of which there are no phantasms, are known to us by comparison with sensible bodies of which there are phantasms."2 The angel knows this, and is able to adapt himself to the mind of man. The human intellect, says St. Thomas, " cannot grasp the universal truth itself unveiled; because its nature requires it to understand by turning to the phantasms. ... . So the angels propose the intelligible truth to men under the similitudes of sensible things."3 I have italicized the last words because here we have the answer to those who contend that Milton could not have justified the form of Raphael's discourse to Adam except by falling back upon poetic licence. We must agree that, as Professor Hanford says, " the poet's function is to embody truth in symbolic images "; but to convey truth by the use of similitudes drawn from sensible experience, which is what the angel does, comes to precisely the 1 P. L., V. 694-6. 2 S. T., Q. 84, art. 7. S. T., Q. iii, art. I.</page><page sequence="11">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 425 same thing. The angel's method and the poet's are, therefore, identical, and Milton could make the angel talk like a poet without the smallest sacrifice of his rational convictions. Thus it is strictly in accordance with the rule of St. Thomas that the angel should add, almost immediately after the words of Professor Hanford's quotation: yet for thy good This is dispensed, and what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By likening spiritual to corporeal forms, As may express them best.1 If Milton's " attitude " here is " Platonic," as Professor Hanford assures us, the evidence is not in the angel's method of exposition but rather in the questioning afterthought: whether, after all, earth is but the shadow of Heaven. That, apparently, is Milton's own addition. The real existence, which it implies, of ideas, except in the mind of God,2 is a doctrine which St. Thomas expressly repudiates. " We apprehend the individual," he says, through the senses and the imagination. And, therefore, for the intellect to understand actually its proper object, it must of necessity turn to the phantasms in order to perceive the universal nature existing in the indi- vidual. But if the proper object of our intellect were a separate form; or if, as the Platonists say, the natures of sensible things subsisted apart from the individual; there would be no need for the intellect to turn to the phantasms whenever it understands.3 We have considered how man is instructed by the good angel. The bad angel's object is deception and temptation rather than in- struction, but he also uses his knowledge of human psychology. According to St. Thomas an angel cannot change the will of man from within; he can change it from without,4 by persuasion, by rousing the passions, or by assailing the imagination. It is the last of these methods which Satan first attempts in Paradise Lost. St. Thomas explains in Aristotelian terms how the imagination causes dreams and delusions, usually in sleep, but sometimes also in waking hours, and continues : So, as this happens by a natural disturbance of the humours, and some- times also by the will of man who voluntarily imagines what he previously experienced, so also the same may be done by the power of a good or a bad angel, sometimes with alienation from the bodily senses, sometimes without such alienation.5 1 P.

S., VOL. 16, 1940 (N9 64, OCT.) In the poem, accordingly, Satan is found Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve; Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams.1 The intellect, says St. Thomas, answering the question whether man in his first state could be deceived, is never deceived in itself; but whatever deception occurs must be ascribed to some lower faculty, such as the imagination or the like. Hence we see that when the natural power of judgment is free we are not deceived by such images, but only when it is not free, as is the case in sleep. There- fore it is clear that the rectitude of the primitive state was incompatible with the deception of the intellect.2 That must have been equally clear to Milton when he made Satan employ " Phantasms and Dreams " rather than open per- suasion or false reasoning. It is probable that the whole of this episode, which has no counterpart in the Biblical story, was designed to dramatize a fact mentioned by St. Augustine and recalled by St. Thomas: that " the woman could not have believed the words of the serpent, had she not already acquiesced in the love of her own power, and in a presumption of self-conceit."3 If that is the true interpretation we must not suppose that Satan's first effort was entirely wasted. He did succeed in inspiring the sleeping Eve with discontented thoughts, Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, Blown up with high conceits, engendering pride,' and thus prepared the way for the real deception at a later stage. Adam, though vaguely aware that an evil agency has been at work, gives a natural explanation, in perfect agreement, so far as it goes, with the theory of St. Thomas. The noblest of the powers given to man is reason. Between it and the senses are several lesser faculties, which might have been specified as the sensus communis, the phantasia or imaginatio, the vis castimativa, and the vis memorativa. Of these lesser faculties imagination is the chief. That agrees with St. Thomas's admission that the imagination, though not denied to the lower animals, confers on man a power which the lower animals do not share : the power of composing and 1 P.

It is, however, or ought to be, subject to reason, its true function being to present those phantasmata without which the human reason cannot operate : of all external things, Which the five watchful senses represent, She forms imaginations, aery shapes, Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames All what we affirm or what deny, and call Our knowledge or opinion.2 But sometimes, in the absence of reason, mimic Fancy wakes To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes, Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams, Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. St. Thomas explains that although, normally, the activity of the phantasmata is suspended during sleep, yet in troubled sleep, and in cases of fever, " phantasms appear, but distorted and without sequence."3 A little earlier he had remarked, quoting St. Augustine, that " what a man does while asleep, against the moral law, is not imputed to him as a sin." This is the comfort offered by Adam when the dream is related to him : Yet be not sad : Evil into the mind of God4 or Man May come and go, so unapproved, and leave No spot or blame behind: which gives me hope That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream, Waking thou never wilt consent to do.5 Eve, though consoled, is still not convinced that she is entirely free from guilt, and sheds some tears. Her grief, considered in relation to her own account of the dream and to the subsequent temptation, must be taken as a sign that Satan had accomplished the first part of his purpose: he had induced Eve to acquiesce, according to the words of St. Augustine already quoted, " in the love of her own power, and in a presumption of self-conceit." I have no wish to deny that Milton helped himself freely to 1 S. T., Q. 78, art. 4. 2 P. L. V. 103-8. s S. T., Q. 84, art. 8. 4 Professor Saurat speaks of these as " terrible words, applied to God" (Milton : Man and Thinker, p. 133). But see Mr. T. H.

S., VOL. 16, 1940 (N9 64, OCT.) ideas derived from other schools of thought, but I believe that the influence of St. Thomas is stronger than is generally recognized, and that it may help to remove some obvious difficulties. It is a commonplace of criticism that Paradise Lost is so designed, at least at the beginning, as almost to compel the reader to sympathize with Satan. It is not merely that Satan displays in perfection several admirable qualities. We are not convinced that he was genuinely free to choose; and even if that doubt were removed we could not believe it to be the will of " all-ruling Heaven " that he should multiply his crimes so as to " heap on himself damnation." Shelley, naturally, makes the utmost use of these words in his rhetorical attack upon Milton's God. " Milton's Devil," he says, " as a moral being is as far superior to his God, as one who per- severes in some purpose which he has conceived to be excellent in spite of adversity and torture, is to one who in the cold security of undoubted triumph inflicts the most horrible revenge upon his enemy, not from any mistaken notion of inducing him to repent of a perseverance in enmity, but with the alleged design of exasperat- ing him to deserve new torments." In spite of any ambiguity there may be, we must consider that Satan had perfect and absolute freedom to choose good or evil at the beginning. The words in which this is expressed in the poem, I made him just and right Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall,2 closely resemble, and were probably suggested by, the statement of St. Augustine: " In veritate autem non stetit, et hoc ab initio ex quo ipse creatus est, qui staret si stare voluisset."3 That, however, is a merely superficial view. Satan's freedom depends upon the fundamental principle that a being of pure intellect cannot be otherwise than free. " Only an agent," says St. Thomas, " endowed with an intellect can act with a judgment which is free, in so far as it apprehends the common note of goodness; from which it can judge this or the other thing to be good. Consequently, wherever there is intellect, there is free-will. It is therefore mani- fest that just as there is intellect, so is there free-will in the angels, and in a higher degree of perfection than in man."4 1 See the Defence of Poetry. S De Genesi ad Litteram, Cap. XVI. 2 P. L., III. 98-9. 4 S. T., Q. 59, art. 3. Duns Scotus, on the contrary, contends for the primacy of the will over the intellect. For a full discussion of his opposition to St. Thomas on this question see C. R. S. Harris, Duns Scotus, Vol. I, Chapter 5.</page><page sequence="15">THE ANGELS IN PARADISE LOST 429 This, so far as it concerns man, is expressed by Adam in his talk with Eve just before her encounter with the serpent: But God left free the Will; for what obeys Reason is free; and Reason he made right.1 He proceeds to warn her, however, that Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the foe suborned, And fall into deception unaware. It will be noticed that Adam does not say that the reason, in itself, can be deceived; his fear is that it may be hindered in its operation by some external obstacle. St. Thomas's view is precisely the same. " In regard to those propositions," he says, " which are understood as soon as the terms thereof are understood, the intellect cannot err." The axiom that the whole is greater than its part may be taken as an example. But the intellect " may go astray as regards the sur- roundings of the thing in its essence or quiddity, in referring one thing to another as regards composition or division, or also in the process of reasoning."2 If we work through a mathematical problem six times and arrive at six different answers it is not the intellect that is at fault; we have been prevented " accidentally," as St. Thomas would say, from seeing the truth which reason, as reason, would reveal. Because of these " accidents," or external obstacles, the human mind may be misled into choosing what is actually evil, though by natural inclination it always prefers good as such to evil as such. In so far as that is true, man's choice is not entirely free. These considerations, however, do not apply to the angelic mind. To the angel, as the Miltonic God expresses it, " reason also is choice,"3 and this rule admits of no qualification. A man, thinking dis- cursively, may reach a wrong conclusion and so make a wrong choice, but may afterwards see his error and correct it; an angel, thinking intuitively, makes his choice once, and can never alter it at any later stage because he is incapable of wishing to alter it. " The angel's apprehension," says St. Thomas, differs from man's in this respect, that the angel by his intellect apprehends immovably, as we apprehend first principles which are the object of the 1 P. L., IX. 351-2. 2 S. T., Q. 85, art. 6. a P. L., III. xo8. As the statement refers to an angel the word intellect would be preferable to reason. St. Thomas argues that " in man reason and intellect are the same power," but the angel has only intellect (S. T., Q. 79, art. 8).</page><page sequence="16">430 R. E. S., VOL. 16, 1940 (N9 64, OCT.) habit of intelligence; whereas man by his reason apprehends movably, passing from one consideration to another; and having the way open by which he may proceed to either of two opposites. Consequently man's will adheres to a thing movably, and with the power of forsaking it and of clinging to the opposite ; whereas the angel's will adheres fixedly and immovably. .... So it is customary to say that man's free-will is flexible to the opposite both before and after choice; but the angel's free-will is flexible to either opposite before the choice, but not after.1 Milton, if he intended to follow this doctrine, must be considered to have distorted the argument, and, in so doing, to have laid himself open to such criticism as that of Shelley. As Satan cannot alter the choice once made it is true, in the sense which we have considered, that he is condemned to " heap on himself damnation." He is not, however, under any external compulsion; the compulsion is in the nature of his being. I am obliged to conclude this article without having arrived at a simple and unqualified answer to the principal question raised at the beginning: whether the angels in Paradise Lost are truly beings of " pure Intelligence,"2 as Adam acknowledges on one occasion, or whether they are visible inhabitants of a visible Heaven. Either opinion, as I have attempted to show, can be supported by citations from the poem, though the contradiction becomes clearer when we read certain passages in the light of Tertullian and certain other passages in the light of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. My own belief is that Milton intended, at the beginning, to represent the angels as pure intellect and will. Though this is, at first sight, impossible in poetry, Milton brings it just within the bounds of the theoretically possible by availing himself of a rule which is doctrinally sound as well as poetically true : that angels in what shape they choose, Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure, Can execute their aery purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfil.3 He makes a departure from the accepted theory, as we have seen, by insisting that the body so assumed is a real body, capable of assimi- lating food. That is a matter of small importance so far as it con- cerns the good angel, who always retains a certain majesty; but it is fatal to the pretensions of the Prince of Evil, who had claimed I S.

The statement that in at his mouth The Devil entered, and his brutal sense, In heart or head, possessing soon inspired With act intelligential 1 condemns Satan to an unnecessary degradation; for it is a possible and usual interpretation of the Biblical story that Satan actuated the movements and dictated the words of the serpent from outside, without assuming its identity. Milton seems to revolt at anything that has even the appearance of a compromise. Either Satan did possess himself of the body of a serpent or he did not. If he did, he must make himself responsible for the serpent's every movement, even to the shuffling of his body and the twisting of his tail ; just as Raphael, appearing in the form of a man, must display the appetite of a man when he sits down to a meal. It seems to be true, on a general view of the poem, that the Satan who extorts our admiration at the beginning is the Satan of orthodox theology, and that the degraded Satan is Satan as the school of Tertullian might have imagined him. 1 P. L., IX. 187-90.</page></plain_text>
