Abstract In this chapter on the history and prehistory of Shipibo material culture, the authors demonstrate the longue durée of Shipibo design styles and their relationship to cultural practices. Ronald L. Weber, a student of Donald Lathrap, and Peruvian archaeologists Daniel Morales Chocano and Ana Mujica Baquerizo present recent archaeological research combined with a study of Shipibo mythology and historical data. They focus on the description of Cumancaya, the ancient site that may contain the earliest evidence of their settlements, and provide solid groundwork for understanding the development of indigenous artistic traditions in relation to place. Resumen En este capítulo sobre la historia y prehistoria de la cultura material shipibo, los autores demuestran la longue durée de los estilos diseñados por los shipibo y su relación con las prácticas culturales. Un estudiante de Donald Lathrap, Ronald L. Weber, y los arqueólogos peruanos Daniel Morales Chocano y Ana Mujica Baquerizo presentan su más reciente investigación arqueológica, combinada con el estudio de la mitología shipibo y datos históricos. El estudio se enfoca en la descripción del antiguo lugar de Cumancaya, que podría albergar la evidencia más antigua de sus poblados y también provee de una base sólida que nos permite entender las tradiciones artísticas indígenas y su relación con el lugar. This chapter provides a historical context for understanding the importance of "place" and continuities and change in material production among the Shipibo-Conibo. Information in this chapter comes from archaeological research, ethnohistory, and ethnographic collaboration with a group of Shipibo living around Santa Clara and San Francisco de Yarinacocha and another group living on Imaríacocha. José Roque Maynas, his wife Juana Cumapa Rengifo, and their extended family worked closely with Weber in all phases of this study, but his first ventures into the upper Amazon in 1969 were guided by Donald W. Lathrap, and Catalino Augustin Cumapa and his wife Casamira Santiago were his tutors. Many trips to the area have been made since, maintaining regular interaction with the inhabitants of Nuevo Chicago, part of Santa Clara adjacent to San Francisco de Yarinacocha. Research was carried out in Spanish, but Shipibo terms were collected as frequently as possible, checked, and compared with terms collected by Loriot, Lauriault, and Day (1993). The coauthors on this chapter, Daniel Morales Chocano and Ana Mujica Baquerizo, have conducted archaeological research on the Shipibo since 2000. They excavated principally at the site of El Zapotal, located near the confluence of the Marañón and Ucayali rivers. The chapter begins with a discussion of the character of the Amazonian environment and how it has shaped Shipibo lifeways and beliefs, then discusses the archaeological evidence for their cultural development in this place, and finally describes changes in material culture production from historical times to the present day. Environment and Lifeways in the Amazon The territory where the Shipibo reside is defined by the valley of the Ucayali River, which receives the waters shed by the most eastern Andean slopes and joins the Marañón above the town of Iquitos to become the Amazon or Solimões (Fig. 1.1). The Ucayali and all the tributaries that join the river from the west are Whitewater rivers, carrying substantial sediments. The tributaries that join the Ucayali from the east also carry substantial sediments and can be classified as Whitewater streams, but they appear to carry less alluvium and differ in mineral content. Alluvial soils deposited by the Ucayali are relatively rich, but in areas that are not annually flooded, the soil is less fertile. These older upland soils are not adequate to raise some crops, especially maize and plantains. For more than 4,000 years, peoples have been cultivating small gardens to raise staple crops (principally manioc) in these regions (both along the large rivers and inland near smaller tributaries). Over time, as nonindigenous peoples migrated into the region, more intensive exploitation of the resources has depleted primary forests. A major impact was the construction in 1943 of the Lima-Pucallpa highway (Ortiz, 1986: 169). FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 45, NOVEMBER 11, 2016, PP. 9-20 9</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2.1.

The Ucayali River typically meanders with regular S-shaped curves. Water moving more rapidly on the outside curve of meanders steadily cuts into the earth to leave a steep bank. More slowly moving water on the inside curve tends to deposit its load to form beaches. Segments of the river are often isolated as the river digs through adjoining banks. Resulting isolated oxbow lakes are an important habitat for fish and the Shipibo who hunt them. Yarinacocha is an example. Of equal importance are drowned river valleys dammed by natural levees that form more irregularly shaped dendritic lakes. Imariacocha is a composite lake consisting of an oxbow whose levees have dammed a dendritic river system. Both types of lakes are the color of tea and not very rich in nutrients during the dry season. However, when the level of the Ucayali River rises during the wet season, the lakes are flooded and become rich with river nutrients. The dendritic lakes are richer in fish resources because the amount of shoreline to water is greater and more land life and litter fall into the water to supply food for fish. To understand the distribution and history of peoples on major rivers, such as the Ucayali, and archaeological evidence for cultural history of the Shipibo-Conibo (Lathrap, 1970), it is necessary to recognize that larger rivers generally contain more fish and that their shores have more fertile alluvial soil. Smaller tributary rivers that branch into the main stream tend to have fewer resources than the larger rivers formed by their junction. This greater abundance permits the support of a larger human population. When factors such as technology and social organization are equivalent, competition for these resources generally allows the larger downriver human population to pressure the slightly weaker upriver people. The tendency for groups to shift up stream is inherent is this population differential. When a weakness occurs in the downriver population, perhaps caused by epidemics, the upriver population will often retake the positions of their downstream neighbors. When populations are pushed to the most upward area of small rivers, they will move off the rivers and occupy less rich interior environments. Riverine populations tend to be lineal and promote ranking based on their position along the river to create a social hierarchy. Boats are the main form of transportation. Once displaced from the riverine environment, villages lack the natural alignment, and people frequently cluster into villages that are more egalitarian. Villages often take on a circular plan, and social hierarchy is diminished. The movement of interior populations is less restricted, and walking is the main mode of transportation. Trade for specialized products frequently occurs between interior and riverine peoples. When conflict between peoples living along the rivers in lineal-type settlement and interior-type settlement occurs, its results are unpredictable since interior people tended to compete with riverine people with guerilla-type warfare and river people with retaliatory raids. Epidemics were much more severe when they struck the large, open populations of riverine peoples. Smaller closed populations frequently were less severely infected. These general circumstances are important factors in explain- ing the distribution of Amazonian peoples and cultures. During the past 4,000 years, riverine cultures tended to migrate up the Amazon and only occasionally shift back down. Amazonian societies, including the Shipibo, continue to maintain lifeways dependent on the rivers and lagoons of this basin from the time of their ancestors. They conduct their daily lives in this riverine 10 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2.2.

Morales. environment, where they create subsistence, traditions, customs, and ideology. Today as in times past, the river is compared to the great serpent, called Ronin in the Shipibo language and Yacumama in the Quechua language. Ronin, as Belaunde states later in this volume, is represented as an iconographie motif, geometric and schematic, in all the painted artifacts, such as ceramic ware; textiles; macanas , or clubs; and other ceremonial ornaments, such as the traditional corona , or crown. In Shipibo-Conibo cosmovision, the river represents the great cosmic serpent, mistress of the universe and the source of all kené designs. The river is also compared to the sky where the stars pass in canoes and where strong currents flow and other worlds exist, as exemplified in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. Morales and Mujica's excavations in the Zapotal site and on the Napo River (Fig. 2.3) found archaeological evidence, such as this geometric serpent seen in a fragment of a plate from the Zapotal site (Fig. 2.4), and in a naturalist form in the bell-shaped contour of the vase from the Napo River (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2). In the Shipibo-Conibo iconography, there is also a great square cross, which represents the Southern Cross that dominates the center of the sky during the dry season and is the gateway through which the dead enter the other world (Fig. 2.5). This philosophy is similar to that represented in the great iconographie scenes of the Mochica culture that develops in the north of Peru during the period from 100 to 600 CE. Archaeologists call these scenes "the rebellion of the artifacts," in which men's weapons and tools come to life, rebel, and capture the warriors (Morales Chocano, 2002). Certainly, this belief of the Shipibo-Conibo and Shetebo people clearly reflects the great importance of the rain forest and water culture media or habitats in which they were born, emerged, and developed. This entire cosmovision is sufficient reason to assert that they have a notable philosophy and a way of life balancing earth, sky, and water in the Amazon environment. Thus, it cannot be said that they are of Andean origin; rather, they are clearly of Amazonian origin. In fact, they themselves explain their origins as a result of the dynamics of this great river in which they live. Archaeological Evidence for Shipibo-Conibo Antecedents and Material Culture Production The Shipibo are the descendants of Panoan-speaking peoples who lived in the northeastern part of Bolivia and southeastern Peru before 300 CE (Lathrap, 1970: 131; Myers, 1988: 60-64). The first cultural signs of these people in the Ucayali area appear as the Pacacocha Tradition at about 300 CE (Myers, 1974: 135). This cultural tradition is one of the major contributors to the sophisticated Cumancaya style dated to between 800 and 1000 CE. Cumancaya is characterized by a complex set of vessel forms with incised designs and postfired polychrome painting. MORALES ET AL.: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE AMONG THE SHIPIBO-CONIBO 11</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2.3. Location map of the archaeological site of El Zapotal. Illustration: D. Morales. Peter Roe (1973) demonstrated conclusively that Cumancaya is the antecedent culture to the ethnographic riverine Panoans. Shipibo-Conibo mythology, as told to Lathrap (1970) and Carolyn Heath (cited in Alayza et al., 2002), also places the people's origin in the village of Cumancaya, where grew an enchanted tree whose leaves moved without wind. Its fruit burst open under an intense sun, dropping the seeds into the waters of the lake to be eaten by gamitanas, a now rare and highly prized Amazonian food fish. In a short while, the fish began to fly like birds. The people were amazed, saying that surely God had given them medicine to fly. They took the leaves of that tree, squeezed the juice, and sprinkled it all over the village. "We're going to fly," said the people, and they fell asleep. The next day, when the people awoke, the village began to tilt and then took off into the air. It began to fly but did not arrive at the sky- world; instead, it fell spectacularly, and all the pottery broke into pieces. For this reason, local people do not touch the pottery shards found there, thinking that they are enchanted. Cumancaya appears to be composed of two distinct ethnic contributors: the Pacacocha people and an elite class that is sometimes referred to as Inca (Lathrap et al., 1985, 1987). This elite group of traders from the eastern flank of the Andes may have spoken a Quechua language. Today, the Shipibo refer to an "Inca" in many of their origin myths. Another ancestral site is Canchahuaya on the lower Ucayali, where, similar to Cumancaya, Fig. 2.4.

Photo: D. Morales. there is an archaeological site with a quantity of ceramic remains, both sites partially inundated during periods of very high water. In 2001, Morales and Mujica began research in the Reserva Nacional del Pacaya-Samiria, undertaking excavations at the El Zapotal site a few kilometers from the present-day town of San José del Samiria near the confluence of the Marañon and Ucayali rivers that form the Amazon (Fig. 2.4) (see also Morales Chocano, 2002a, 2002b, 2008, 2011; Mujica, 2002). At the El Zapotal site, Morales and Mujica found evidence of secondary burials in red-slipped ceramic pots. Associated with these, they found skulls with flattened foreheads and penis-shaped artifacts. The Tschopik film, as discussed by Ödland, shows that the practice of flattening skulls existed in the 1950s. In the 2011 documentary, several people commented that they remembered the practice, and one woman said that her skull had been flattened. Morales and Mujica also discussed their findings with contemporary Shipibo villagers in the vicinity of El Zapotal and also were told that head flattening was familiar though no longer practiced. Their informants also recognized the penis-shaped artifacts and called them " shibinantes" and said they were used in puberty rituals. Although by themselves the presence of these artifacts in ancient sites and the ability of present-day Shipibo to recognize them do not constitute proof of continuities of cultural practice, they do warrant further research on the linkages between past cultures and current configurations. This work has added more recent evidence of the antecedents of the Shipibo-Conibo in the wider context of other Panoan and non-Panoan peoples. However, much ambiguity remains in the archaeological record about the migration and interaction patterns of these ancient cultures. Around 1300 CE, a powerful group of Tupian speakers moved upriver and occupied parts of the middle Ucayali. Their most southern extension is represented at Imariacocha on the Tamaya River south of Pucallpa. The Caimito phase of the polychrome tradition is the archaeological remains of this intrusive Tupian group (Lathrap, 1970; Weber, 1975). The people who introduced the Caimito style came upriver from what are now Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil and were very closely related to the makers of the Napo and Miraconguera polychrome ceramics (Evans &amp; Meggers, 1968). These pottery traditions are distinguished by relatively thick polychrome pottery incised with broad lines and painted in black and white slip paint. Anthropomorphic urns and vessels with square horizontal cross sections are characteristic of these traditions. A deeply incised square platter-like vessel in Figures 2.6 and 2.7 is decorated with mythical two headed serpents, a common motif. It appears that with the collapse of the Tupian chiefdoms that occupied the upper Amazon, the Miraconguera, Napo, and Caimito traditions ended. The Caimito tradition ended by 1600 CE, and the Shipibo began to reoccupy the central Ucayali. Three funerary urns (Figs. 2.8-2.10) belong to distinctly different cultural groups, separated in space and time, but share the polychrome style of the central Amazon. The Caimito and Napo also shared the practice of secondary burials in urns, making them participants in the same cultural tradition that MORALES ET AL.: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE AMONG THE SHIPIBO-CONIBO 13</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 2.6. Caimito square open plate with incised double-headed serpent design. Photo: R. L. Weber. survived among the Shipibo-Conibo of the Ucayali until approximately 50 years ago. Basket weaving has undoubtedly been practiced in the upper Amazon from earliest times, but no preserved basketry or textile fabrics have been identified in the archaeological record. Basketry impressions are found on the bottom of some late prehistoric Caimito phase vessels (1300-1500 CE). Large palm leaf-plaited patterns resembling the weave used to make sleeping mats and smaller plaiting that resembles the work on Conibo sewing baskets are indicated. Impressions of coiled or sewn rod work are also found. Gunther Tessmann's cartograms show the distribution of particular culture traits on a map of Peru. With these maps, Tessmann shows that sewn rod mats are associated with the riverine Panoans but not with the Tupians (Tessmann, 1930, Kartogramm 9). It is likely that basketry was practiced in the upper Amazon throughout the known ceramic periods dating back at least 4,000 years. Because of the perishability of these materials and the lack of ceramic impressions, no reliable evidence for basketry art has been found to predate Caimito. The dating and prevalence of the spinning of cotton can be fairly well recognized by the archaeological occurrence of ceramic spindle whorls. If spindle whorls are rare, one can suspect that less fiber was spun. Abundant spindle whorls suggest greater use of fiber and textile manufacture. One spindle decorated in the Hupa-iya style (around 200 BCE) was found on the surface at San Francisco de Yarinahacocha, and conical spindles are quite common during the Cumancaya phase (800- 1200 CE). Spindles of a square shape appear with great frequency during the Caimito phase, and there is little doubt that a great amount of cotton thread was being prepared by Caimito people at Imariacocha (Fig. 2.11). Weber (1992) has proposed that the square spindle whorls, similar to the square plates mentioned above, have ritualistic and cosmological significance. The square forms show four double-headed dragon-like figures defined by broad incised lines around the edges. Square spindle whorls are often decorated with an abbreviated version of this design. These vessels and spindle whorls are most likely representations of an axis mundi and access to a multileveled cosmology. Oddly, there are no reports of any spindle whorls being found in either the Napo phase of Ecuador or the Miraconguera phase of Brazil. The Shipibo often use perishable wood or turtle bone spindles, and it is possible that such spindles were used by the people of these other polychrome phases. Nevertheless, the absence of spindle whorls in the other polychrome traditions is significant. Apparently, the spinning of cotton and large woven textiles was not as important to the Indians of the polychrome traditions of the Napo and Amazon rivers. Change in Colonial and Postcolonial Times The early Spanish explorers found culturally similar popula- tions groups separated by large buffer zones, which suggest ongoing hostilities between them. The first Spanish to enter the upper Amazon were members of the Gonzalo Pizarro Expedition in 1540, when Orellana, one of Pizarro's captains, made the long voyage from the upper Amazon in the Andes to its mouth at the Pacific (Herrera, 1963). Juan Salinas de Loyola was first to enter the Ucayali in 1557-1558, traveling up the Ucayali to the juncture of the Tambo and Urubamba rivers (Myers, 1990: 7). No people were encountered for the first 100 leagues, or approximately 300 to 400 miles (Myers, 1974: 139). 14 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 2.7. Three Caimito serpent designs from interior of square plates. Photo: R. L. Weber. This unoccupied area was either the result of an established buffer zone between the Omagua, Cocama, and Cocamilla or the lack of high grounds suitable for permanent occupation adjacent to the river. Salinas de Loyola found three principal groups identified by Myers as the Cocama, Conibo, and Piro and described large villages of up to 400 houses and a chiefdom- type society with inhabitants adorned in cotton fabrics and gold ornaments (Myers, 1974, 1990: 7). The Conibo were occupying the central Ucayali, while the Tupian-speaking Cocama occupied the lower river, and the Piro, an Arawakan-speaking people, were to the south on the upper Ucayali (Myers, 1974: 135-158, 1997: 124). The next recorded entrance into the Ucayali occurred in 1562, when an advance party from the Pedro de Ursua Expedition went to the "Cocama River." The Cocama River is an old name for the Ucayali River, which was controlled largely by Cocama Indians. Juan de Vargas, the leader of this group, captured many men and women to serve as servants and brought back canoes filled with maize (Simon, 1971). These early contacts in the late 16th century introduced epidemics and caused significant population shifts. Disease and slave raids from Brazil continued to stress the indigenous MORALES ET AL.: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE AMONG THE SHIPIBO-CONIBO 15</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 2.8. Caimito-style funerary urn, after Lathrap. Photo: D. Morales. population through the 17th and 18th centuries (Edmundson, 1922; Hemming, 1978). Steward and Metraux quote Izaguirre (1948: 303-304) and state that the Shipibo originally lived on the upper Aguaytia River (lat. 8°S, long. 75°W), from which they were driven in the 17th century by the Cashibo, an interior group who in turn had been pressed by the Campa, another interior group living on the Gran Pajonal. The Shipibo occupied the Aguaytia and Pisqui rivers at this early time and did not move on to the Ucayali until about 1820 (Myers, 1997: 125). The Shipibo themselves drove the Conibo from the region of the mouth of the Aguaytia River southward up the Ucayali River to the Pisqui. These population shifts probably actually began in the 16th century, when the Cocamilla, Cocama, and Omagua chiefdoms that occupied the lower Ucayali, and Marañón began to collapse under stress from epidemics and Portuguese slave raids. The collapse of the Tupian-speaking chiefdoms created a relative vacuum on the lower Ucayali River. This area remained depopulated and served to insulate the Shipibos from the mid- 17th-century turmoil (Myers, 1997: 124). The area was not occupied again until the mid- 19th century. Little is recorded about the inhabitants of the Ucayali for the next 100 years, but it appears that the chiefdoms dissolved to become more egalitarian, and the population declined. The first well-described contacts between the Shipibo and Spanish missionaries took place in the middle of the 17th century. Jesuits approached the Ucayali from the north, while Franciscans came from the south and west down the Pachitea River. Missions were established by both groups, but there were frequent rebellions against the religious and military domination. Massacres of the Spanish occurred in 1695 and 1698. In 1698, the Conibo united with the Shipibo and the Shetebo to repel a Spanish punitive force, and the Jesuits were driven out (Myers, 1990: 11). The Ucayali remained free of Spanish influence until 1757, when 16 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 2.9. Guarita-style funerary urn from the central Amazon. Photo: D. Morales. Franciscan missionaries returned to the Ucayali by way of the Pampas de Sacramento to the Cashabatay River (Myers, 1990: 12). This second intrusion of Spanish was pushed back, but in 1760, they returned to establish missions among the Shetebo and later the Shipibo. By providing iron tools to the Panoans, these mission centers prospered, but the Indians revolted again in 1767, and missions were not reestablished until 1791 (Myers, 1974: 139). Since 1791, the area has been under continual contact with missionaries and Spanish- speaking people. Beginning in the late 19th century, many male Shipibo worked as peons collecting rubber, timber, or other forest products. The rubber boom began in 1884, and exploitation continued to 1912 (Ortiz, 1984: 215). During this time, most adult Shipibo men were recruited by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking patrons into indentured service. Most men adapted tailored clothing and became bilingual. Women remained in their traditional villages and did not acquire a second language. Pre-Colombian Textile Traditions In 1540, Carvajal, the chronicler for the Orellana expedition down the Amazon, reports that in the territory controlled by the Omagua chief Aparia the Great, Indians brought them cotton to caulk their newly constructed brigantine (Medina et al., 1934: 185). He also states that four Indians visited Orellana "decked out in gold and [splendid] attire." These four emissaries stood out as being dressed differently from other Omagua, perhaps wearing the long painted cushmas , while the majority of Omaguas were not. Weber suggests that this is the period when cotton textile clothing was first introduced to the Omagua. The lack of spindle whorls in the Napo phase ceramic tradition, the archaeological traces of the Omagua, supports this conclusion. Farther downriver, good cotton cloth is again mentioned, but it is not clear that the cotton was clothing. Very good quality cotton goods were also seen at a locality on the MORALES ET AL.: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE AMONG THE SHIPIBO-CONIBO 17</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 2.10. Shipibo-Conibo funerary urn. This urn has stylistic and functional similarities with Caimito- and Guarita-style urns, demonstrating the historical continuity in burial customs and ceramic styles and patterns. Photo: D. Morales. central Amazon. This sighting was probably below Manaus (Medina et al. ,1934: 21 1). It is still farther down river that bark cloth was probably seen for the first time: "two mitres, very well made [and yet] with [only] natural skill, resembling those which bishops wear: they were [made out of] woven [goods] and we do not know out of what [material], because the stuff was neither cotton nor wool, and they were of many colors" (Medina et al., 1934: 212). The Omagua, the descendants of the people who produced the Polychrome Napo culture of Ecuador, were surely wearing woven cotton garments by 1700. In the mid- 18th century, Omagua men wore woven cotton shirts and pants, while women used loincloths and pampanillas or shawls (Maroni, 1988: 306). In the early 18th century, a contemporary of Samuel Fritz, the head Jesuit missionary on the upper Marañón, reported that "the men of the Great Omagua tribe that live in the Islands of 18 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 2.1 1. Spindle whorls. (A) Shipibo biconical painted spindle whorl, 5 cm in diameter. (B) Caimito incised square hollow spindle whorl, 4.5 cm wide. (C) Cumancay conicle spindle whorl, 5 cm in diameter. Illustration: R. L. Weber. the Marañón wear today breeches and shirts of cotton, woven and colored with considerable artistry." These shirts of cotton may be examples of cushmas. "The women content themselves with two pieces of the same kind, one of which serves them for a small apron, the other to form an indifferent covering for the breasts, painting the rest of the body even the hair with the juice, darker than mulberry, of a forest fruit that they call Jaguá " (Edmundson, 1922: 49-50). Using Maroni as a source, Metraux (1948: 694) states that the Cocama and Omagua wore " cushmas , woven of cotton and decorated with painted or woven geometrical designs in red, blue, yellow, orange and green" and that "women wore knee-length cotton skirts and sometimes a little mantle." The knee-length skirt may be his translation of pampanilla. This description of women wearing small apron-like clothing could be interpreted as skirts. However, it may pertain to a small apron-like garment like ones used by the tribes of the northwestern Amazon. Tessmann (1930: 817, Kartogramm I) shows all the main- stream riverine groups, (Shipibo, Conibo, Piro, Omagua, and Cocama) as wearing woven cotton garments like ones used by the Shipibo today. It is possible that the Panoan groups introduced the use of the cushma and the tube skirt to the Tupian groups, first to the early Cocama-Caimito people, and later the Cocama introduced the style to the Omagua. The lack of archaeological examples of spindle whorls in the Napo component suggests that the Napo-Omagua people were spinning less thread and did not adapt the cushma fashion and tube skirt until the late 16th century. The Cumancaya MORALES ET AL.: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE AMONG THE SHIPIBO-CONIBO 19</page><page sequence="12">people probably introduced the style to the Caimito people, and the dress style spread down river. Shipibo traditionally credit the "Inca" with the introduction of weaving. "Inca stories" told by José Roque relate that the "Inca" wears a fine cushma. The designation of "Inca loom" for the typical back-strap loom used by the Shipibo today has historical validity. It is likely that the loom was introduced to the central Ucayali by the Cumancaya or one of its antecedents in the Pacacocha tradition. Large conical spindles of the Cumancaya phase are similar in form to smaller conical and biconical ones used today by the Shipibo. They are unlike Caimito square spindle whorls (Fig. 2.11). Today, Shipibo men dress most often in Western clothing, but some older men still wear the cushma or tari in the evening and on ceremonial occasions (Fig. 2.3). Older women generally wear a tube skirt ( chitonie ) and a blouse (coton) made of brightly colored commercial cotton or synthetic fiber, as Ödland and Weber discuss in this volume. Older photographs of Shipibo women show them wearing a skirt and a piece of cotton cloth over both shoulders like a shawl. One photograph, believed taken on the Ucayali in 1871, shows a man labeled "Conibo" wearing an unpainted tari and his daughter wearing a feathered skirt (Akazawa et al., 1992: 192). The unpainted cushma and beaded bandolier seen in the photograph are reminiscent of the Campa style, but the headdress is similar to one illustrated by Farabee (1922: plate 17). This picture may be either Conibo or Campa. The cushma shows the vertical warp stripes with no painted designs, and the bandolier is characteristic of Arawak- an-speaking Campa Indians who live on the headwater tributaries of the Ucayali. It is possible that some Conibo wore plain, striped cotton garments until the late 19th century, but Farabee's 1907-1908 visit to the Ucayali records Conibo women wearing "cotton skirts and shoulder cloaks" (Farabee, 1922: 82). His illustra- tions demonstrate that these were painted with the intricate designs characteristic of the riverine Panoans. Farabee also states that "sometimes, instead of a cloak, they wear a waist (an historical term for a blouse) with short sleeves." Illustrations of Shipibo and Conibo in Farabee's book show women only with the cotton cloaks, which are approximately the same dimen- sions as a dress but lack a seam to close the tube. The waist that sometimes was worn may be the first indication of a shift to using the blouse or coton that is used by all traditional Shipibo women today. The coton was probably not in use much before the beginning of the 20th century. Today, Shipibo clothing is used as a symbol of identity and political solidarity by both men and women but is not worn by young people in the villages. Western-style, commercially made clothing is common, while traditional dress is reserved for ceremonial or special occasions and especially important for display to visiting dignitaries. Today, Shipibo men are frequently employed as guides and informants to scientists, explorers, and tourists. Western tailored clothing suits this kind of employment. In contrast, women gain their livelihood by selling arts and crafts to tourists, and traditional dress is for them a useful marketing tool. Money earned has allowed many Shipibo to purchase useful manufactured imports, such as metal cooking pots, plastic containers, Western clothing, guns, boats, motors, beads, and, more recently, modern electronics. In 2004, processes of change were further accelerated when construction began on the Interoceanic Highway to link Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific ports. Even before its completion, the highway had major impacts on conservation efforts and indigenous rights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Interoceanic_Highway [accessed December 9, 2014]). While not immediately near the Shipibo lands, the road passes through other environmentally rich areas, such as the Tambo- pata Reserved Zone near Madre de Dios. Finished in the fall of 2014, the 2,603-km road is expected to cause unknown and substantial demographic shifts, environmental changes, and further pressures of globalization. Most contemporary Shipibo men and women are bilingual in Spanish and their native language. Still, they maintain a strong ethnic identity and remain culturally distinct from the purely Spanish-speaking population that is now the majority of the area. They clearly state their pride in their culture in the documentary Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories. It remains to be seen how they will balance their desire to maintain their distinct identity with the changes wrought by the expanding national economic frontier. 20 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page></plain_text>
