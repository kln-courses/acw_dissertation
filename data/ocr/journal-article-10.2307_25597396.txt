This paper focuses on the modern perception of the idea of tan?sux among the Ahl-i Haqq, the "People of the Truth". It is mainly based upon the field materials collected from the Ahl-i Haqq in the Iranian provinces of Kermanshah, Kurdistan, and Eastern Azerbaijan. Keywords Metempsychosis, Extreme Shi'ites, Ahl-i Haqq The death of man is like the dive of a duck. None know where it shall re-emerge.1 Tan?sux (lit. transmigration, metempsychosis) is one of the adscititious elements, initially alien to the doxies of Islam. Some Muslim authors at tributed this phenomenon to the Indian influence, approaching it as a shibboleth of the Hinduism.2 Shahrastani was, probably, the first, who noted that overall, metempsychosis was a typical characteristic of sec I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Victoria Arakelova, who shared with me her field materials on the Ahl-i Haqq of Iran, and whose guidance and consultations helped me in my research on the subject. 1 A popular interpretation of the reincarnation of souls among the Ahl-i Haqq (Field notes of the author; see also Minorsky 1960: 261). 2 Al-Biruni considered the idea of metempsychosis to be the essence of Hindu ism as the tauh?d in Islam, the belief in Trinity in Christianity, and keeping the Sab bath in Judaism (Biruni 1995: 88). ?

They held that Allah the Most High existed in any place, spoke any language, appeared in any human form; and this means incarnation" (Saxrastani 1984:154).3 In Muslim "heretic" milieu, tan?sux marks primarily the so-called yu l?t, the Extreme Shi'ite sects.4 Generally, the "heresy" of the yul?t is believed to rest on the four ba sic tenets: anthropomorphism, alteration of divine estimation, the re appearance of the Imams, and reincarnation of souls (Saxrastani 1984: 153). Among the so-called ash?b at-tan?sux, the Ahl-i Haqq seems to be one of the least explored subjects.5 We are focusing here on the modern perception of the idea of tan? sux among the Ahl-i Haqq, relying mainly upon our field materials col lected in the provinces of Kermanshah, Kurdistan, and Eastern Azerbai jan, Iran. The general idea of tan?sux among the Ahl-i Haqq does not presup pose the successive re-birth of the whole universe, which, according to the dogma, was once created and will be once renovated after the near advent of S?hib az-Zam?n (Lord of Time). This single-shot tan?sux-e mala k?t?, according to the Ahl-i Haqq, is a general eschatological idea, shared 3 The same author (ibid.) also gives the following four grades of transmigration of souls: al-nasx ("metamorphosis"), al-masx ("transformation"), al-raxs ("rooting"), and al-fasx ("dissolution"); the level of angels and prophets being the highest grade, and that of demons andjinns, the lowest. 4 On the Muslim sectarians who accept the idea of tan?sux, see, e.g., Saxrastani 1984: 67-69, 153; among the Shi'ite sects in particular, see, e.g., Naubaxti 1973: 138 146. As for the Sufi milieu, Al-Hujwiri (1999: 260-266), e.g., writes about the Hul?l?s (later also mentioned inter alia by Sahrastani) formally professing to belong to Sufism and, at the same time, sharing the idea of tan?sux, thus making "the Sufis partners in their errors". The belief in tan?sux definitely occurred in early Yezidism, a syncretic ideology developed on the basis of the 'Adawiyya Sufism in the 12-14th centuries. However, in the Yezidi religion today, the concept of tan?sux as that of metempsychosis is rather marginal, and coexists with the traditional idea of para dise, hell, and retribution after one's death (see Arakelova 2004: 20-21). The same term, tan?sux, is sometimes used by Muslim authors in a wider sense as the doctrine of the successive re-birth of the world, or the successive lives of the universe; the latter not being typical of Islam even in its heterodox forms. 5 Various aspects of metempsychosis in the Ahl-i Haqq doctrine are discussed by Zukovskij (1887: 9-ll); V. Minorsky (1911: 9, 12-13; 1960: 261); Moosa (1988: 196 ff.); Nur 'Al?4?h El?h?(see Mokri 1966: 29, 39, 115,125,145;Jeyh?n-?b?d? 1984: 443-446); Mor?d?(l999: 271-272); etc.</page><page sequence="3">M. Khaksar/lran and the Caucasus 13 (2009) 117-124 119 by all Muslims, including the "People of the Truth" themselves. Thus, the essence of the eschatology of the Ahl-i Haqq is the Last Judgement (s?n "review") as a result of which the Good shall enter paradise, and the Wicked shall be annihilated.6 The term tan?sux in the meaning of transmigration cannot be nar rowed down to the metempsychosis among humans only. It can be equally applied to the reincarnation of the theophanies; the successive manifestation of divinity being the central idea of the dogmas. The same Eternal Divine Substance manifests Itself each time in a different form, always accompanied by angels. The original substances (S?t) of the angels, in their turn, become reincarnated every time in a new "dress".7 In discussing reincarnation?both that of divinity and humans, the Ahl-i Haqq use the formula "to come (to dwell) in a garment"?be leb?s (J?ma, d?n &lt; Turk, don) ?madan.8 Another important nuance of tan?sux is that divinity (Xwos?n, S?h Xwos?n, X?vandag?r, or Soltan Ish?q), despite the fact that God is in each creature, and His particles (zarre-i 8?t-e Xwos?n) are found in each subject, can be more visible in saints and chosen personalities. Right af ter Creation, S?h-Xwos?n manifested himself in Benyam?n, then?in P?r D?w?d, in Mus?, etc. (Zukovskij 1887: 9-10). In the most dramatic periods of human history, when in the fight be tween the two basic human qualities?mind (the source of the Good in the material world) and passion (the source of evil), the latter prevailed, Sah-Xwos?n manifested himself in Ibrahim, 'Is?, 'All, etc., depending on the place and religious milieu in which the "People of the Truth" had to live.9 6 Such ideas, i.e. the advent of Mahd?, Resurrection, and Judgment Day, although very often referred to by the Ahl-i Haqq, are also approached as a probable later im print from Twelver Imami influence (Ivanow 1953: 74). 7 On the successive manifestations of divinity, who always appear together with their (four or five) angels, see, e.g., Minorsky 1911: 12-13, 64; Ivanow 1953: 73-74; Mokri 1966:112-114. 8 "Garment" as a metaphor for "body", and "to divest oneself of one's garment" as that for "to die", is typical of many traditions. The Yezidis use the expression ki rns guh?r?n (lit. "to change a robe") as a synonym for the verb "to die". In one of the Parthian Manichean mourning hymns, the dramatic description of the Prophet Ma ni's death is represented with the same metaphor: fram?xtis tan??r padm?zan a?Sen (M5, 63-66) - "And he (the Prophet Mani) shed his beautiful bodily garment (i.e. died)" (Arakelova 2004: 70) 9 In this regard, Zukovskij (ibid.: 10-11) notes that such a perception of God al lows us to characterise the Ahl-i Haqq not only as 'Al?-Il?h?, but also as '?s?-Il?h?, lb</page><page sequence="4">120 M. Khaksar/Iran and the Caucasus 13 (2009) 117-124 Finally, tan?sux is approached as descent of the divine principle in certain men: S?h-Xwos?n temporarily manifests himself in outstanding personalities at the most crucial moments?the high points of their lives.10 The most popular example of such kind of tan?sux is Baba Tahir Oryan.11 Sectarians retell legends about how this great mystic, feeling special flushes of divine energy, would start making utterances of the Truth.12 The "Divine Substance, with Its consubstantial extensions, not cre ated from nothing" as Ivanow (1953: 73) puts it, the so-called 8?t-i qurs ("hard, permanent, or lasting substance") is opposed by the Ahl-i Haqq to S?t-i mihm?n, the passing, temporary, ephemeral substance of ordi nary men. Correspondingly, contrary to the above described manifesta tions of divinity, the successive transmigration (d?n be d?n) of a human being's soul (tan?sux-e melk?, lit. "earthly, material reincarnation")13 is approached by the Ahl-i Haqq as a means to perfection and purifica tion.14 A soul is supposed to go through one thousand and one r?h?m-Il?h?, since 'Al? as manifestation of S?h-Xwos?n, does not differ from '?s?, and 'Ts? from Ibr?h?m. The Ahl-i Haqq explain the special role of 'Al? or other particu larly worshipped figures by the fact that they purposefully dedicated their lives to those searching for the Truth in Persia. This, in ?ukovskij's opinion, points to the main and essential difference between the Ahl-i Haqq and the Nusayrites of Syria, the latter being approached as real 'Al?-Il?h? venerating 'Al? as God Himself. Among the contemporary Ahl-i Haqq, there are several approaches to 'Al?. Sometimes he is described as s?heb-e 8?t-e xod?, "Master (Lord) of God's Essence". Some consider him as the highest amongst humans. Nur 'Ali-Shah Elahi, a prominent leader of the Ahl-i Haqq, puts 'Al? among the mazhar?t (divine manifestations): just as a mirror, which reflects the Sun, God manifests himself through 'Al?(Mokri 1966: 215). 10 Cf. the so-called "partial incarnation" compared by Shahrastani to "a sunglow in a window or a sun highlight in a crystal", and opposed to the complete (absolute) incarnation, which is "like the appearance of an angel in a human form or a devil, in an animal one" (Saxrastani 1984:135) 11 Baba Tahir Oryan, a great Persian poet and mystic of the 11th century, is also considered one of the manifestations of angel Azrail (Minorsky 1911:11). His mysti cal verses are approached by the Ahl-i Haqq as revelation. His tomb in Hamadan is among the main places of pilgrimage for the sectarians. 12 The author's field materials (see also Zukovskij 1887: ll). 13 The Ahl-i Haqq say that all Muslims believe in tan?sux-e melk?, although they erroneously consider it a one-shot act (similar to tan?sux-e malak?t?), when people will resurrect and get their material bodies after the Doomsday. The Ahl-i Haqq be lieve that the process of getting new bodies takes place constantly in the material world. 14 Ivanow (1953: 74) characterises this item of the Ahl-i Haqq dogma as not prop erly elaborated: threatening the sinners with rebirth as filthy animals, it says ap parently nothing about the reward for the good and pious.</page><page sequence="5">M. Khaksar/ Iran and the Caucasus 13 (2009) 117-124 121 reincarnations, each depending on the previous life. However, the pos sibility of purification is bound by the initial nature of the human being. Those created out of yellow clay (zardagil) go through more reincarna tions. Through this suffering they correspondingly increase their lumi nous state and thus approach God. The evil beings created out of black earth (sy?h-x?k) have no chance for complete purification and will be annihilated. There are two types of tan?sux-e d?n be d?n: ascending and descend ing, regarding the personal qualities of a person, his inner characteris tics, and his nature. A person's appearance, the Ahl-i Haqq say, has its material dimen sions and is subject to time influence, while the inner nature, which has no dimensions and can be neither observed nor touched, is permanent, having real meaning. Among the four kinds of tan?sux, only nasx ("metempsychosis, metamorphosis"), in fact, presupposes the reincarnations from one hu man's body into another (ruh be ruh). Masx ("transformation") is a kind of reincarnation into an animal's body, rasx ("rooting")?reincarnation into a plant, and fasx ("dissolu tion")?reincarnation into an inanimate object. Naturally, reincarnations from a human's body into any other is considered descending, while from any of the mentioned three forms into a human?ascending. However, tan?sux-e r?h be ruh can be as cending or descending by itself, depending on what kind of body a per son acquires, what characteristics of a person prevail in a new incarna tion, and, most importantly, what kind of retribution he is supposed to get for the previous deeds.15 The reincarnation from a human body into a human body is consid ered to be the most common. The reincarnation into a plant or inani mate object is very rare in our times, when the advent of S?hib az-Zam?n is near. 15 According to Ahl-i Haqq tradition, there are mystics who, as an exception, can see somebody's new incarnation. A dervish from Kermanshah, 'Al? Am?n?, told a story of the reincarnation of a young man who had committed suicide. Since suicide is considered a great sin among the Ahl-i Haqq, the soul of the sinner could not be born again among the "People of the Truth". The dervish said this soul was born in Latin America, the place where passion prevails over mind, and the soul had less chance for purification (Archives of the Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies, Yerevan, File 20/33, folio 17). There was an Ahl-i Haqq woman, who had lived near Tehran and died some 25 years ago, and who claimed she was the incarnation of Hazrat-e F?tima (Field materials of the author).</page><page sequence="6">122 M. Khaksar/ Iran and the Caucasus 13 (2009) 117-124 A very interesting explanation is given to reincarnations into vari ous animals' bodies, which can happen as a result of certain sins: mur der, deceit, robbery, lust, etc. Simultaneously, various animals are associated with human vices: a dog with avidity, a donkey with stupidity, a wolf with brutality, a pig with rapacity, etc. Another interesting aspect is metempsychosis of demons, jinns, and fairies, who, according to the doctrine, exist, reproduce and reincarnate like human beings, changing their d?ns. Apart from this successive rein carnation, the jinns, for instance, can temporarily enter the bodies of various animals?cats, birds, serpents, etc.?which is another kind of metempsychosis (Mokri 1966:125). Despite obvious parallels in the concepts of metempsychosis of the Ahl-i Haqq and other religious systems (e.g., in the philosophy of Antiq uity, in Hinduism, and in Buddhism), they seem to be completely differ ent in such basic philosophic points as freedom of the will and deter minism. For the Western religious psyche, freedom as prerequisite of moral responsibility has special significance. In the Indian religions, the same problem of freedom is perceived in a different way, and connected with the concept of karma, which, in its turn, confines freedom to a certain extent, by the results of previous deeds. Thus, the latter appears more fatalistic against the former. As for the Ahl-i Haqq, their doctrine, with the initial limitation of souls' purification, sounds absolutely determi nistic, even compared to Hinduism. The Ahl-i Haqq determinism excludes the opportunity of the libera tion of a soul as a result of mystical, transpersonal practices, while, in Hinduism, a soul, in principle, can avoid another reincarnation.
