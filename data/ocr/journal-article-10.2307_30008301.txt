<plain_text><page sequence="1">Irish Historical Studies. xxiv, no. 94 (Nov. 1984) Language, nationality and cultural identity in the Irish Free State, 1922-7: the Irish Statesman and the Catholic Bulletin reappraised I n 1967 the late F. S. L. Lyons published an essay entitled 'The minority problem in the 26 counties', defining the minority in the Irish Free State as 'unionist in politics and mainly protestant in religion'.1 Since that date the topic has received considerable scholarly attention. Indeed the tendency has been to approach the cultural development of the new state in the years after independence from the point of view of that minority.2 While this paper does not seek to minimise the significance of the minority's role in the evolution of the new state, it does seek to question the validity of the perspective produced by an excessive preoccupation with that role. That perspective is most clearly articulated in the published version of Lyons's Ford lectures, Culture and anarchy in Ireland, 1890-1939. The vision there presented is of an island rent by 'four irrevocably warring cultures' (Gaelic, English, Anglo-Irish and Ulster protestant).3 The cultural history of the Irish Free State in the first decade of independence, it is argued, is best understood as a battle between two of these apparently immutable cultures. In essence this view presents the nineteen- twenties as the decade during which Gaelic and Anglo-Irish Ireland confronted one another in the arenas of language and religion. The images are now fixed. A dignified, gracious and urbane Anglo-Irish ethos is beaten down by the shabby reality of a burgeoning, philistine catholic-Gaelic power. The minority, according to Lyons, although 'enervated by the almost repressive tolerance shown by the majority',4 were engaged in the 'final round of the old conflict between Irish-Ireland and Anglo-Irish Ireland'.5 This paper seeks to examine such assumptions in the context of the cultural insecurities made manifest in the years after independence and to place the concerns of the minority in the broader context of the new state's quest for cultural identity. It further seeks to re-examine the two journals upon which 'F. S. L.

I The concept of Irish nationality, as articulated by intellectuals and propa- gandists, was a remarkably self-conscious phenomenon. Having much of its origin in the antiquarianism of Anglo-Irish scholars in the nineteenth century, it was popularised, and perhaps vulgarised, by the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association in the early twentieth century. The nationalism of Arthur Griffith's Sinn F6in was a sturdier plant and, despite the fissure of that party during the civil war, it was its practical patriotism of constructive realism that dominated the thinking of the government of the Irish Free State. The manner in which ideas or allegiances permeate a society is not easily analysed. While the propaganda of Sinn Fiin and D. P. Moran influenced a minority, and while the G.A.A. and the Gaelic League provided a nationalist focus for popular culture, it is clear that a revolution of sensibility came about in Ireland not by words written on a page, but by the emotional impact and the mythic stature of the gesture of 1916 followed by the sense of common allegiance created by the first Daiil and by its rhetoric of power. For many that rhetoric was to be an impelling force from which they were destined never to escape, but for the catholic church, the Irish Free State government and the majority of the people in 1922 the time had come to halt. Pearse's clarity of vision was a luxury the nation could no longer afford. Certainty was not an option for the new government after the signing of the Anglo-Irish treaty. Its members had to compromise with themselves, with a section of the Irish people, with the British government, the government of Northern Ireland, the southern unionists and most significantly with the republican dream. For the republicans they were traitors to the purity of that dream, to its romantic force and spiritual clarity. The fight had been 'essentially a spiritual fight, .... a fight of right against wrong, a fight of a small people struggling for a spiritual ideal against a mighty, rapacious and material empire; and as the things of the spirit have always prevailed, they prevail now'.6 P. S. O'Hegarty, a pro-Treatyite and a disillusioned romantic nationalist, remained enthralled by the sheer force of the triumph: 'there is no gesture in history quite so magnificent, quite so proud and nothing that has happened can take away from it'.7 But others found the consequences frightening. In June 1923 Cardinal Logue observed that 'the people of Ireland were running wild after visions, dreams and chimeras and turning the country upside down in the process'.8 D. P. Moran had led the vanguard of an Irish-Ireland movement and, despite his own professed belief that 'an infallible way to paralyse a people is to aim at a utopia', his consistent hectoring in the columns of the Leader informed the Irish people that they suffered from an inferiority complex, that 'all the while, like Pendennis, we ourselves were our greatest 6Mary MacSwiney in Ddil Eireann treaty deb., p. 118. 7P.

Its potency lay as much in the mythic power of its compounded inaccuracies as in the spiritual dignity of its inevitable failures. It was straightforward, fuelled by economic and social deprivation but fundamentally self-confident. The concept of nationality was more complex. Notwithstanding the social Darwinists' attempt to depict the simian Irishman," there were few characteristics to distinguish the Irishman from his hereditary foe. By the 1890s the majority in Ireland spoke English, and displayed 'a natural tendency to imitate the rich and the mighty, who happen to be a foreign race'.12 The architecture of the period displays a kitsch vulgarised medley of debased Celtic crosses, shamrock bedecked harps and ornate simulacrums of tottering round towers." The life of Ireland had been gazed at through the prism of the Victorian sensibility and deflected back on an impressionable people. Fossilised prior to its demise, 'Celtic' or 'Gaelic' Ireland was brought before the eyes of its inheritors as an anthropomorphic phenomenon of boundless charm. From the quasi-intellectual heights of Matthew Arnold'4 to the aristocratic collating of Lady Gregory"5 three generations of intellectuals had behaved in the fashion of experimental analysts on the supplicant and oblivious patient - the spirit of Irish nationality. The existence of an Irish language and the predominance of the catholic religion were the two most manifest features by which Ireland could be differentiated from external cultural influences. The secular nature of the 1922 constitution of the Irish Free State and the tradition of ostensible separation between church and state, which were legacies of the British connexion, ensured that catholicism, whilst remaining overwhelmingly dominant in the twenty-six counties, could not be elevated to the official heights of a national symbol.16 It has been suggested that in reality success was a shock, that most of those who fought had assumed that this was yet another false dawn in the securely damned cause of Irish freedom.'7 For the Irish Free State government it was a challenge, an opportunity to prove the capacity of the Irish to rule themselves. Administrative efficiency was not an end in itself but it would be a beginning. 9D. P. Moran, The philosophy of Irish-Ireland (London, 1905), pp 77, 99. 10Ibid., p. 109.

A smooth administrative takeover would not suffice. Ireland free had been the promise for generations and its achievement, scarred by the civil war, torn by partition and lassoed by the imperial tie was viewed nonetheless as a milestone. Something was to change. Michael Tierney was typical of those who expressed a need for a design in policy even before the achievement of independence: We must have a national philosophy in government, in the shaping of that philosophy must go not only a few chosen intellects in some urban libraries or debating societies, but the collective genius of the Irish people. The first provisional government of a new Irish republic must be based on something, it must have an all embracing economic and social policy and it must educate its citizens. There are at present not very many people who have any clear idea of what they would wish to do; and those who have have them in embarrassing and contradictory profusion.18 A commonplace of the Gaelic League enthusiast or indeed of those who simply loved and cared about the Irish language was eloquently expressed by Myles Dillon, a son of the parliamentarian, when he said that an Irishman 'living in the west at all and speaking some Irish would never seek to bring Ireland to spiritual greatness, whatever about spiritual unity with an English tongue that can only paralyse an Irish mind and weaken Irish spirituality'.19 From the opening sitting of the first DAil eloquent lip service was paid to the Irish language, a tongue that the majority of its members did not speak. By August of 1921 the correspondence of Ernest Blythe was reverberating to the refrain of 'Gaelicising and nationalising'20 the educational system. The concept of Gaelicisation was a revolutionary one, though it was couched in visions and images of an ideal past. The ambiguity inherent in the concept is epitomised by the ugly juxtaposition of two languages in the word itself. For the idea of Ireland to retain its symbolic potency the concept of a distinctive culture, unique to the island, was vital. The language was viewed as an essential wellspring of that culture. Gradually a group of the 'most conservative revolutionaries in history' committed themselves to the initiation of a cultural revolution of language and sensibility. Administratively enforced as a part of the pragmatic realism of an intensely unromantic government, it was messianic, emotional and subjective in origin. Writing in 1932, Joseph O'Neill, an ardent promoter of the Irish language, surveyed the work of a decade of independence: throughout the struggle those men associated with the language movement had played an important part in supplying both leaders and soldiers to the national forces and, when victory came, the new government consisted largely of men who had been brought up on Irish-Ireland ideals. One of the main planks of their programme was therefore the restoration of Irish as the national language and one of their first acts was the re-establishment of Irish as an essential part of the curriculum of the primary and secondary schools.21 18Michael Tierney, Education in a free Ireland (Dublin, [1919]), p. vi. 19Myles Dillon, 'Mr Eglinton and Gaelic culture' in Irish Statesman, 6 Sept. 1919. 20See, e.g., Sean 0 Ceallaigh to Blythe, 17 Aug. 1921 (University College, Dublin, Archives Department, Blythe papers, P 24/25). 21Joseph O'Neill, 'The Irish language and the linguistic struggle' in Bulmer Hobson (ed.), Saorstadt Eireann official handbook (Dublin, 1932), p. 263.</page><page sequence="5">230 Irish Historical Studies It was a debt of honour to the wounded national psyche, an unarticulated pursuit of the distinctive features of Irish nationality, a post-colonial quest for identity by a nation intensely aware of its past cultural integrity. II But there was another Ireland for which independence was a disorientating and depressing experience - the final link in a chain of disaster that had begun with the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869. 'It is manifestly absurd to pray for the lord lieutenant when this office no longer exists.'22 So the Church ofIreland Gazette recognised a new reality for its church and people in January 1923. A questioning of the degree to which the values and aspirations not merely of that particular community, but indeed of all those who did not share the publicly articulated values of the nationalist apotheosis, have formerly been represented as the agony of a mature and cultured intellectual class forced to come to terms with the reality of a new native ascendancy is central to an attempt to understand the struggle for cultural identity in the new state. Yeats versus those 'fumbling in the greasy till' would appear accurately if crudely to epitomise the current orthodoxy. Loyalties, values and allegiances, intellectual, moral and emotional, disturb the 'scientific' historian. When such forces of human motivation are treated at all the temptation is to render them neat and precise in an attempt to give form and structure, to clear the muddy waters. Seamus Heaney, in writing of Francis Ledwidge, has sketched loyalty's complexity: In you, our dead enigma, all the strains Criss cross in useless equilibrium And as the wind tunes thro' this vigilant bronze I hear again the sure confusing drum You followed from Boyne water to the Balkans But miss the twilit note your flute should sound You were not keyed or pitched like these true blue ones Though all of you consort now underground.23 A 'sure confusing drum' was what the British government had played in the ears of the southern unionists. Many left the country in 1922 but the majority stayed. Patrick Buckland has clearly chronicled the end of their political history as a distinctive grouping, their final political action being the Anti- Partition League's attempt to hold Griffith to his promises, to ensure that the constitution of 1922 was as favourable to their demographic misfortune as possible.24 What was their place in the new order to be? Loyalists, unionists, ascendancy, l61ite: loyal to an empire which cared little for them, unionists in an Irish Free State where, in the words of W. Alison Phillips, the Trinity College historian, 22Church of Ireland Gazette, 12 Jan. 1923. 23Seamus Heaney, 'In memoriam Francis Ledwidge' in Fieldwork (London, 1979). 24Patrick Buckland, Irish unionism - I: the Anglo-Irish and the new Ireland, 1885-1922 (Dublin, 1972), pp 223-71.</page><page sequence="6">O'CALLAGHAN - Language, nationality and cultural identity 231 it is impossible to read the Dail debates on the place of the crown in the constitution without resenting, not so much the vulgar insults directed by the more ill-conditioned deputies against the person of the king, as the policy of the British ministers in forcing the recognition of the crown oh people who openly proclaimed that they did not want it, and so exposing it to the ignominy of being described by Irish ministers as a meaningless symbol.25 Power was the property of the 'gunmen' of the Anglo-Irish war and the new 'Sour State'26 was the political reality. For many, including Lord Glenavy, the second last lord chancellor of Ireland, pragmatic adaptation seemed the only profitable option. Glenavy, having failed to secure appointment as an English lord of appeal, reluctantly accepted nomination to the senate, which he had earlier dismissed as 'neither ornamental nor useful'.27 He presided over that assembly as chairman with magisterial disdain. John McLoughlin in proposing Glenavy as chairman articulated the new reality: we do not want to reopen the graves of dead and buried controversies or array anyone here in the shroud of party politics. I think it was Gambetta who said, when he was taunted with surrounding himself with loyalists, 'I refuse to ask the date on which any man became a republican', and I think this senate would be unwise to ask anyone at what date he ceased to be a unionist and became a loyal supporter of the Irish Free State.28 Transition was on the surface apparently swift and ubiquitous in the period after the signing of the treaty. George Sigerson in a senate debate on civil war political prisoners made a salient point when he attempted to remind the senators of the fact that 'men who are one year prisoners and denounced as criminals and non-politicals, may in another year or two become political leaders, perhaps law givers in legislatures for the country'. The civil war camaraderie that developed between ex-unionists and the provisional govern- ment was essentially a combination of reserved unionist relief at the good will of the new government and also a collusion in rhetoric that both parties brought to bear on republican outrage.29 The factors motivating those republicans who burnt houses, mansions and property throughout this period were normally represented as either 'military' or 'strategic'. The catholic bishops and archbishops in their statement on the condition of the country "5W.

Alison Phillips (Revolution in Ire.), P. S. O'Hegarty (Victory of Sinn Fiin) and Donal O'Sullivan, The Irish Free State and its senate (London, 1940), has uncovered abundant evidence of it. Former unionists and Irish Free State supporters alike consistently analysed republicanism in terms of 'criminality'. See, for example, Kevin O'Higgins's contribution to the Seanad debate on the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill on 26 July 1923 (SeanadEireann deb., i, 1455-64) and, in particular: 'it has not been war, it has been organised crime and sabotage on the grand scale, anarchy with arms; anything but war as war was ordinarily understood. There is criminality latent in men everywhere, I take it.'</page><page sequence="7">232 Irish Historical Studies issued from Maynooth on 20 June 1922 detected a significance more tribal and immediate: in Southern Ireland also we have seen only too many instances, though they are comparatively few, of barbarous treatment of our protestant countrymen. Not only has their property been at times unjustly seized, and they themselves occasionally driven from their homes, but their lives have in some cases been murderously attacked. We condemn unsparingly these manifestations of savagery of which some reckless people have been guilty. They are contrary to the teaching of the catholic church and are alien to the traditions of Southern Ireland in which protestants and catholics have lived together in neighbourly harmony. No plea of reprisals for the treatment meted out to the catholics of the six counties can justify these immoral attacks on life and property. A primary duty of a stable government will be to crush the lawless elements who have gone far to stain the name of our fair country, and a first duty of the people will be to aid the government in bringing the criminals to justice.30 Revenge for what was happening in north-east Ulster, but also, perhaps, revenge for memories other than those of Sir John Keane. 'We must all be aware', he declared in the senate, 'of the circumstances under which many of these places were maintained and occupied. They represented in not a few cases a traditional life largely supported by associations and by sentiment and by family tradition and the house itself, the fabric, with all the associations was a distinct feature of that life.'3' In January 1923 Marlfield House, Clonmel, the home of the historian Richard Bagwell and the seat of his family for many generations, was destroyed. The republican justification for the outrage was the historian's membership of the senate. The Church of Ireland Gazette lashed out at the perpetrators of the crime, and also at their class and kind: 'whatever may be the view of those whose talk is of bullocks those whose talk is of anything else are wondering if the time has come to fold up the map of Ireland'.32 The attitude displayed is frustrated, superior and puzzled. That Bagwell should suffer such a fate simply for joining the senate of the Irish Free State was a doubly barbed blow: What the acceptance of this position means to one of the unionist traditions we suppose only Irish unionists can estimate. It is an act of the highest patriotism, and all those who have generously refused to play the part of political dog in the manger by offering their service to the new government, and have loyally accepted a change which they did not desire, ought to be a first charge on the chivalry of their fellow countrymen.33 Carson had understood the dilemma of these people when, in the house of lords during the debate on the Anglo-Irish treaty, he alone had contemplated their changed circumstances: 'I speak - I can hardly speak - for all those who, relying on British honour and British justice have, after giving their best to the service of the state, seen themselves deserted and cast aside without one single sign of recollection or recognition'.34 On Armistice day 1923 the Reverend G.

His topic was loyalty, his congregation largely composed of those of imperial allegiances, those of whom Carson had spoken. The greatest trial in life is when the loyalties by which we live fail us ... Neither sickness nor pain nor poverty can break down the spirit of a man or a woman so rapidly or so effectively as the unworthiness of any loyalty in which we have put our trust ... Now, we imperial Irish today are naturally feeling hurt and sore because these ideals of government which we valued and to which we were loyal have been allowed to be superseded. The flag which symbolised our loyalty to the empire which our race did so much to build has been removed and another is substituted in its place ... We must not allow ourselves, because things have not gone as we wished, to lapse into a cynical mood as to the value and worth of loyalty ... It is the same in the case of our church. I sometimes hear people say 'the Church of Ireland is done in this Free State. Our people are going as fast as they can and it is not worth while bothering to keep things going.' And so they get careless and slack because we are few and the others are many. But what have numbers and size to do with loyalty to what we know to be right and high? Anyone can swim with the tide. Anyone can shout with a crowd. A loyalty that is true only in a crowd and only in prosperity and ignores the central idea is not a loyalty at all!3" The principles of decency and order were not however to be relinquished by a people whose abiding respect for constitutionality was, though jaundiced, undiminished. The daughter of John Allen Fitzgerald Gregg, archbishop of Dublin, and a prominent figure in Church of Ireland circles both ecclesiastic and academic, describes an argument which she had with him in later years: The British government was, in his view, sacrosanct, and he could not imagine it acting except from the most lofty and humane motives. I once exclaimed after he had declared himself to be absolutely behind the government in some colonial matter where we sceptics thought we could discern signs of exploitation cloaked by self-righteousness: 'You'd think the British government were divine arbiters!''I believe they are', he said in deadly earnest, and went on to describe how he envisaged the British as the trustees of Christianity in a pagan world.36 The British government had concluded a treaty and established the Irish Free State, and it was therefore the duty of all loyal Irishmen to 'support, even if we cannot love, the lawfully constituted authority of our country'." While viewing the new state as in many respects distasteful, they nonetheless assumed that it would require the services of their not inconsiderable talents. In discussing the role of the Anglo-Irish in empire building the Church of Ireland Gazette concluded: Irishmen, in the past and in the present, have furnished their quota towards the foundation and preservation of what are now a constellation of great free societies. And what of the future? What of that genius for organisation, that restless spirit of adventure, that power of the tongue, that cunning with the sword that have brought us what fame we have? Will the Ireland of the future furnish possibilities vast enough to absorb them all? It is to be doubted.38 "Church of Ireland Gazette, 23 Nov. 1923.

(George William Russell) in an editorial comment on education in the Irish Statesman offered an analogy: The habits, the character, the appetites of the vast mass of the people are but little changed by political or economic revolutions brought about by the seizing of power by some group when circumstances permit. The establishment of the Free State and the northern government in Ireland has not been accompanied by any change in the character or mentality of the vast mass of the people. Such changes are like putting on the hands of a clock which goes slow but when the fault is in the mechanism the putting on of the hands does nothing.39 The putting on of the clock's hands, as far as southern unionists were concerned, simply involved their acknowledgement of a willingness to participate in the new state, since, in the words of the Church ofIreland Gazette, it would be foolish to imagine that the loyalists of the south and west regard change which is impending with any great enthusiasm. Ireland is their country. Thousands of them will never leave its shores; and they are determined to make the best of things, continuing in the future, as in the past, to work for the good of their native land and to give offence to none. But they have certain principles which no change of government can banish. They are good Irishmen but they are also good Britons, loyal to the throne and person of their king, and to the glorious tradition of centuries which is woven around Great Britain's name.40 Perhaps this awareness of imperial glory and omnipotent splendour was one of the multifarious, subtle, factors that made their separateness not merely a thing in itself but also a screen against which the new state measured itself. The relationship of the 'native' Irish with the Anglo-Irish had always been a complex, ill-defined affair. They, the Anglo-Irish, were the landlords, the sophisticates and men of property; the catholic bourgeoisie had no yardstick other than the fading gentility of the Viceregal Lodge against which to measure themselves and their emerging prowess. As the Irish Times had suggested in January 1922, so the southern unionists did: they entrusted themselves to the unknown. A year later the standing committee of the general synod on behalf of the Church of Ireland presented an address of welcome to the governor- general of the Irish Free State, Tim Healy. It expressed the church's willingness to 'promote Christian charity and good will among Irishmen of all creeds and classes'.41 In his reply the governor-general expressed the wish that religious distinctions in the political sphere would be rapidly obliterated and that the Church of Ireland would have reason to rejoice at the impartiality and vigour of the new administration. He also recognised the peril undergone by the protestant laity in rallying to the support of the national government and suggested that Irishmen should in the future concentrate on points of agreement instead of exaggerating differences. While public and church leaders did abide by this advice, there were others, on the fringes of their particular traditions, for whom the exaggeration of differences was an essential component of identity. They required external opposition against which to define themselves. 39Irish Statesman, 3 June 1925. 40Church of Ireland Gazette, 23 Mar. 1923. 41Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">O'CALLAGHAN - Language, nationality and cultural identity 235 III In presenting a view of this decade as one during which Gaelic and Anglo- Irish Ireland fought a battle in the arena of culture and morality, statements from the Catholic Bulletin and the Irish Statesman have been juxtaposed and presented as alternative authoritative voices, each articulating their respective traditions. While the Church of Ireland Gazette was widely read by the members of that church and so may, together with the Irish Times, offer an insight into their mode of thought, the Irish Statesman had a far smaller readership and is more accurately to be viewed as a forum for intellectuals many of whom happened to be protestant. The Catholic Bulletin, which appears to have acquired an historical curiosity value, perhaps because of its extremism and bombastic pedantry, far in excess of its actual significance at the time of publication, may be viewed as representing merely the most hysterical and distorted fringe of the tradition from which it came. It does however provide a key to the understanding of the sense of cultural inferiority that disorientated and confused many Irishmen. Terence Brown has made a straightforward conclusion from an examination of its utterances: 'indeed that periodical suggests that a good deal of Irish- Ireland enthusiasm was generated less by idealistic cultural imperatives than by a desire to advance catholic power and social policy in the country through the defeat of protestant Ireland and the Anglicised culture associated with it in ideological warfare.'42 This conclusion is limited though accurate in its estimation of the motivation of the Catholic Bulletin. The Bulletin was anti- protestant, pro-Irish-Ireland and pro-catholic, but to reach conclusions about Irish protestantism, catholic Ireland and the philosophy of Irish-Ireland by an analysis of its statements is to give it a validity it scarcely deserves, and to miss its essential significance which is as an extreme manifestation of reactive cultural confusion. Written in English, the Catholic Bulletin condemned literature in the English language. Denying the validity of non-Gaelic or 'adventitious' elements in Irish society, it revealed a relentless obsession with them. Devoted to Daniel Corkery's concept of a 'hidden Ireland' and a life of intellectual and cultural complexity, it denounced in ill-structured harangues the preoccupations of 'intellectuals'. Condemning the tawdry cultural products of the Irish imagina- tion shackled by an alien tongue, it produced second-rate verse in English at monthly intervals: Lay thy cool hands upon my face That I may be thereby ordained An acolyte of infant grace - By me, alas, too long profaned.43 The Catholic Bulletin, terrified by the absence of 'a spirit of Gaelicism or an active sense of nationality', was in its manner of expression distinctive only in the vitriolic intensity of its resentments. The journal provided a justification for the fears of Ireland's cultural and intellectual future that were allegedly its '2Brown, Ireland, p. 71. 43Catholic Bulletin, Feb. 1925.</page><page sequence="11">236 Irish Historical Studies raison d'etre. In effect it represents a magnified and corrupted monument to the basest insecurities of a post-colonial society. A favourite object of attack by contributors to the Catholic Bulletin was the arrogant confidence of the Irish Statesman. They loathed 'the sewage school of the associated aesthetes and its close connections with Plunkett House'.44" The Bulletin's vitriol was directed not at southern unionists like the late J. P. Mahaffy (whose detestation of Irish culture was legendary) but at those former constructive unionists like Sir Horace Plunkett (who had always endeavoured to assist Ireland to the limits of his awareness) and more particularly at Anglo-Irish nationalists like A.E. (the editor of the Irish Statesman) and Yeats, who were regarded as cultural wolves in sheep's clothing. Lyons, committed to an image of warring cultures and equally committed to the idea of the intellectual superiority of the Anglo-Irish, depicted the Irish Statesman as an intellectual oasis in an arid desert of catholic and Gaelic myopia: 'it is hardly too much to say that between 1923 and 1930 when lack of resources forced it to close the Irish Statesman was the window through which the less benighted Irishmen sought to look at the world'.45 It was such assumptions of cultural superiority which enraged those for whom identity was an open question. The Irish Statesman irritated people like Father Timothy Corcoran, S.J., a frequent contributor to the Catholic Bulletin and professor of education at University College, Dublin, precisely because its contributors were intellectually self-confident and clear about the type of Ireland that they wished to create. For some catholics, like George O'Brien, the existence of educated, urbane Irish nationalists was a pleasant revelation. An academic colleague of Corcoran's, he had written for the Irish Statesman on occasion. A member of the Royal Dublin Society and the Arts Club, and acquaintance of A.E., George Birmingham, Lennox Robinson, Shaw and, of course, Plunkett, he was starkly honest in documenting the feelings of many professional catholics. The Arts Club was a place where I found a new type of nationalism unlike anything I had met before. I found myself for the first time among people whom I found socially agreeable and who had nationalist convictions. I had always previously thought, I imagine, that the upper classes in Ireland were all unionists and that nationalism was confined to the lower and middle classes. But now I discovered that people whom I could admire for their social ease and upper class attitude were nationalists."46 While George O'Brien could clearly adapt to the conventions of his new society and indeed acquire its standards, others felt permanently wrong- footed, gauche and resentful at its confidence, arrivistes in their own land. The Catholic Bulletin articulated the directionless lashing-out of frustrated inferiority, the zeal of those in pursuit of a persecutor, a reason for their plight. During the past twenty-five years there has been a pretence at a constructive policy in Ireland. It was a mere pretence and it had many aspects of dishonesty, conscious as well as unconscious. The sham organisations associated with the name of Plunkett and with Plunkett House, Merrion Square, Dublin, were always closely tied to English interests, 44Ibid., Jan. 1925. 45Lyons, Culture &amp; anarchy, p. 163.

These organisations shrewdly enough ramified into education, into book-writing and journalism, into art and into social life. They endeavoured thus to control and mould Ireland and they have failed for all their pretentious publicity and all their strident self-praise.47 The last sentence is the nub of the argument. Men accustomed to blaming all their ills on foreign domination bitterly resented the participation of what they viewed as a coterie amongst the old ascendancy in the new state daring and presuming yet again to set themselves at the top of the pile. In their eyes the 'Cromwellian secularism' of Trinity College and all that it stood for had been deferred to by Griffith and its products given preferential treatment. The official order of precedence approved by the executive council of the Irish Free State indicates the scrupulous justice of the official policy, but is scarcely evidence of excessive deference to the minority.48 The 'Free State is a happy hunting-ground for pension or job-seeking masons', proclaimed the Catholic Bulletin. 'Nineteen out of the thirty members nominated by the president of the executive [council] to the unnecessary, undemocratic senatorial body are Freemasons. Indeed it has been said that these people would not seriously oppose the abolition of the oath, so well accommodated are they under the new system in southern Ireland.'49 The Catholic Bulletin saw slights everywhere. A report in the Irish Times stated that a law brought in by Mussolini to suppress secret societies was viewed apprehensively by the Vatican 'on the grounds that some future government might use it against the church'. The Bulletin was enraged: Now, any intelligent person in the streets of Dublin, on the morning that this extraordinary specimen of eyewash appeared in print, could have told the gentry of the Irish Times that this was merely Freemason flummery and poorly-made flummery at that, ... [a] feeble effort to make out that catholic religious orders are just as much secret societies as the Grand Orient and the Brethren of the Scottish Rite. Its elaborate air of detachment is quite too obvious. How English is the style - the choice of the exact words for the exact things. Or rather, let us put it a grade higher in the literary line and, on the canons devised by the Irish Statesman, let us say, 'how Anglo-Irish!'. The jangle of the triangle clangs out in every passive voice of every verbal phrase: 'it is held', 'it is pointed out' and the like.50 It was this ability always to appear right, urbane, objective and calmly intellectual that drove the Bulletin beyond endurance. International admiration for Yeats ('author of that foul swan song'51), Lady Gregory and Lennox Robinson, who 'according to a New York catholic 47Catholic Bulletin, June 1926. 8See the file on 'official scale of precedence for the Irish Free State' (S.P.O., S 4628). 4"Catholic Bulletin, Feb. 1927. 50Ibid., Feb. 1925.

Yeats's Leda and the swan ('the foul swansong') and a story of Robinson's which drew an analogy between a pregnant country girl and the Virgin Mary aroused consternation in the Catholic Bulletin and forced Robinson's resignation from the committee of the Carnegie Library Trust. Robinson stated in the first number of Tomorrow (12 July 1924): 'My friends who have started Tomorrow deplore the fact that we are surrounded by bad art, bad politics, bad religion'.</page><page sequence="13">238 Irish Historical Studies weekly journal' were 'helping to make Dublin shine as one of the most brilliant literary capitals in Europe', evoked a response that emphasised that Dublin's glow was due to the fact that 'putrescence leads to phosphorescence'.52 This mentality was treated as representative of a sterile tradition that contributed to beating down great art. 'It was', wrote Francis Stuart, 'this spirit of smugness and deadness that we fought against and were defeated by - the spirit of liberal democracy. We fought to stop Ireland falling into the hands of publicans and shopkeepers and she had fallen into their hands.'53 But there has been little questioning of why that tradition was so articulate and relentless. The Irish Statesman did share one common trait with the Catholic Bulletin. It too was obsessed with analysis of what Ireland should or should not be. When people are creating anything, when they are spending their time, their energy, their money on this, they take the trouble to think and the levels of life are raised. The sum total of national energy is increased in the process of creation when a good book is written, a fine play is well acted, a beautiful picture is painted, an orchestra trained, a creamery started, a mill set to work, a new factory built, a scheme for the electrification of our water power well cultivated.54 A.E. bemoaned the vulgarity of the new seal of the Irish Free State: What is there in this but a harp bounded by some mechanical curves and angles and with an outer application of the Book of Kells ornament, interlacings and bases of course all put together without effect. Why let uneducated officials potter about with art as if it did not require special and expert knowledge just as much as the Shannon scheme?" Dreaming of a new Ireland, he complained of the lethargic unrealism that pervaded it: If we continue a sensational life, remaining poor, ignorant and economically unorganised, what noble national movement can be created out of this passion, ignorance and poverty? In such a nation the greater the statesman the more ineffective must he be, because there can be no real link between the thoughts over which his mind ranges; and the meagre outlook of an unread and ignorant people. The people were poorly educated, deprived, the country was devoid even of bookshops: 'there may be courage for sacrifice, but heroes without brains are as dangerous to society as a mad bull in a china shop'.56 Genuine patriotism and a desire for Ireland's advancement was fundamental to A.E.'s character, and indeed to that of most of the Irish Statesman's contributors, but the despair they expressed at the reality of the Free State's inhabitants merely reinforced the insecurities of many of those whom they saw themselves as assisting. 'It is too often true in the life of nations, as well as individuals, that the dream or hope that precedes action is nobler than the realisation', wrote A.E. in 1923 in the first number of the revived Irish Statesman. In this 'confession of faith' A.E. hoped that his countrymen 52Catholic Bulletin, Mar. 1925.

He is even more interested in the future than in the past, and he hopes that this journal may help to create alluring images of the future society and the moulds into which it will be cast and for this purpose he has enlisted the co-operation of many of the best writers and thinkers in this country. But he was scarcely tactful in contrasting this glittering array with the main body of enthusiasts for physical force and for ramming things down peoples throats, composed of boys and girls who left the national schools before they got half the little knowledge made available under the old regime and who have never received any further education and who consequently remain at the age of fourteen in their political ideas.57 Such an attitude of intellectual superiority enraged not merely hysterical partisans. For instance P. S. O'Hegarty, writing of Michael Collins, com- plained that 'it was the editor of the Irish Times, I think (it could only be he), who on his death made some reference to his "want of education". It is true that he had had to earn his living at an early age, and that he never attended a university. If attendance at a university constitutes education then he certainly was not educated.'58 One notable characteristic of many reminiscences of the war of independence is their authors' determination to display the 'learning' or 'culture' of their comrades, as if tuned to respond to an unheard accusation from those who felt themselves to be superior. Liam O'Flaherty, parodying a British description of the archetypal Irish rebel, captures the belief in the average Irish 'gunman's' social unacceptability: 'at any rate he returned to his beloved mother land endowed liberally with those qualities which make him dear to the heart of all Irishmen of murderous inclinations. These latter unfortunately form as yet a considerable proportion of the people of Ireland.'" Liam Mellows was, in the words of Peadar O'Donnell, 'a man of deep knowledge and had read widely in the cultures of many nations. A lover of books on social problems, he had studied James Connolly and Fintan Lalor and the Fenians and their advanced social views.'60 The accusation of poverty of thought had come not merely from outside the physical-force tradition, it was a void of which many of its inheritors were conscious. Other countries and other people have, from time to time, appealed to the sacred right of insurrection but in so appealing they acted under the inspiration of, and combated for, some great governing principle of political or social life. ... The latter-day high falutin' 'hillside-man' on the other hand exalts into a principle that which the revolutionists of other countries have looked upon merely as a weapon. In their gatherings the Irish hillside-men prohibited all discussions of those principles which formed the strength of their prototypes elsewhere, principles which made the successful use of the physical force weapon possible.6" The Irish Statesman upbraided relentlessly: the worst heritage we received from the old regime, an uneducated people with little or no understanding of the intricacies and complexities of the national life, how states are "Ibid., 15 Sept. 1923.

A similar ignorance in Russia led to the most tragic economic collapse any nation in modern times has known and the death by starvation of millions. And in the same number the Reverend George Clune articulated a view contrary to what many conceived to be that paper's orthodoxy, but important in the minds of many thwarted nationalists: Free she (i.e. Ireland] is politically; but here the freedom ends. Man keeps the brute creation harnessed because knowledge is a power; and England with malicious cunning planned that we, with frozen souls, would draft new loads and spend our days in sunless toil. How far the slavery may have rusted through our souls we do not know; but let us know that we are weak and that the nation's soul must feed on noble thought, must pulse with warm feeling, must feast on big ideals and live in view of high achievement if the nation's life is to be a noble, warm glorious thing.62 The insecurities of Irish nationality are best understood by an appreciation of the fears of cultural absorption in the ethos of the 'English-speaking races, in the meshes of which we are woven by a thousand material and immaterial ties'. This fear was fundamental to nationalists of all persuasions, to constructive unionists of the early twentieth century, and even to those for whom the material ties of empire were of deep emotional significance. That the Anglo- Irish, for whom London was the capital, were throughout the nineteenth century bound to their country of birth by a love of place and atmosphere is a truism of the literary historian. Their sense of identity was complex and, while they certainly identified with the British empire and the cumulative culture of England's past, they were nevertheless differentiated from its main stream by multifarious local and national quirks and variations. The Anglo-Irish were frequently proud of both their Irishness and their loyalty to Britain. The forms and structures of an Irish Free State within the empire that they had played such a considerable role in shaping afforded, despite deep misgivings, an endurable accommodation for their allegiances and loyalties. In August 1924, the Tailteann games63 had provided symbolic as well as material evidence of the new order by displacing the Royal Dublin Society's horse-show.64 The Church of Ireland Gazette sounded both accom- modating and accommodated. It is true that the pomp and ceremony of the old viceregal regime has disappeared forever and that there is a certain lack of colour in the social life of today; but when all things are taken into consideration there is no doubt that extraordinary progress has been made in Ireland during the last twelve months, and a nation that can produce the horse-show and the Tailteann games at such a critical period as the present undoubtedly is blessed with an indomitable spirit that nothing can destroy. 62Irish Statesman, 29 Sept. 1923. 6"See Seamus Breathnach's report on the first Aonach Tailteann scheduled to take place in 1922 in the Blythe papers (U.C.D.A., P 24/44): 'the advertisement of the essentially Irish past-times is the prime object of this aonach; but it has a secondary, yet very important object also. We see in our games through their triennial cycle the surest means of permanently cementing the scattered units of the Gael.' 64See the annual reports of the council of the Royal Dublin Society, 1916-24, for an interesting example of adaptation.</page><page sequence="16">O'CALLAGHAN - Language, nationality and cultural identity 241 The union jack was less prominent than in former years, but this was seen as merely an expression of the excessive zeal of a post-revolutionary period: We must bide our time. We are still in a transition period and those of us who have been brought up in the British tradition must be prepared to suffer a little more in sentiment before the past has been forgotten. Our duty today is the same as it has always been. It is, while honouring our king and his flag, to do everything that is in our power for our own little country, to obey loyally the laws of its government and to work steadily for the promotion of its welfare.65 For many Irishmen this was not enough. Still haunted by the fear of Ireland being no more than a 'satellite of Mayfair', they sought to define their difference in a spirit of militant 'Gaelicism'. On the level of high politics this manifested itself in the government's policy of constructive 'Gaelicisation'. Fraught with ambiguities, it provided evidence of cultural sophistication and concern at a senior administrative level, and many of the subsequent accusations of hypocrisy and militancy made against it are simplistic. In the context of the present discussion it is relevant only insofar as government policy catalysed analysis and the questioning of attitudes within the cultural underworld of writers preoccupied with national identity. The cultural question, while fundamental to the new state's policy in education and to its symbolic paraphernalia, was not overriding in a cabinet more concerned with the substance than the forms of liberty. The question of Gaelicisation became in this context not merely an issue in itself but a litmus paper to test sensibilities and allegiances, resentments and prejudices. In identifying the Irish language with Irish nationality in popular culture the Gaelic League had done much to strengthen that sense of nationality. But it also created further national insecurities, a situation perhaps best epitomised by a comment of Oliver St John Gogarty: The earl of Mayo lost his house. Sir Horace's family established themselves in Ireland in the twelfth century. The earl of Mayo was a Burke, a de Burgo. No, they were not Irish as the non-historical Irish or the Firbolg failures, or those who came over thirty years ago from England to teach Ireland how to be Irish. That is the second ingredient in the mentality of destruction, a reserved belief or feeling that the native had a longer history, and therefore had more claim to the land he never honoured, ornamented or owned. The third arises from that frustration which makes him wish to remove all traces of what mocks his incompetence and points a finger at his failure.66 In converting a positive philosophy for the rejuvenation of a language into a defensive attitude of cultural triumphalism, a ludicrous cultural lie was erected. All Irish traditions had expressed themselves within the English language. By denying that heritage Ireland would have dissociated herself from a century and a half of her culture. Language zealots like Father Corcoran contributed to the lack of confidence of the new state by emphasising the polarity between 'Gaelic' and 'Anglo-Irish' cultures and segregating within the narrow term 'Anglo-Irish' all that had been written in English. The roots of this attitude are to be seen in Pearse's early and subsequently reconsidered rejection of Anglo-Irish literature.

W. Russell and his clique we commend Daniel Corkery's new book. They will see how the Gael, the one Irish nation with the Irish literature and culture, regards and dealt with, and will deal with, this mongrel upstart called Anglo-Irish tradition and culture. But the power of the Aesthetes to even understand the plain lesson of The hidden Ireland is what must be doubted.68 Real Irishness, which they were so intent on monitoring, was based upon the 'idea of an historic Irish nation with its one Gaelic tradition, culture and language assimilating but dominating all adventitious elements - Norse, Norman, English - that idea is alone the true concept of Irish nationhood'.69 Edmund Curtis, reviewing Corkery's work in the Irish Statesman, acknow- ledged sorrow at the loss of a distinctive civilisation but expressed the view that 'the vast majority' of those who spoke Irish 'use a more or less debased jargon which serves them quite well for ordinary purposes'.70 This was the type of comment which provoked the worst excesses of the Gaelic enthusiasts. Much of the Catholic Bulletin style of fanaticism was provoked by a belief that the old ascendancy still looked down on the native Irish, or, to quote Corkery's favourite poet, Eoghan Ruadh 0 Suilleabhbin: Ni hi an bhoichtineacht is measa liom, NA bheith sios go deo. Ach an tarcuisne a leanann i NA leighisfeadh na le6in." It was an articulated national historical belief that culture, poetry, literature and aesthetic sophistication were rich and complex in Ireland before the alien Saxon had debased the native Irish: It is very different in Ireland now to those old days when the poorest catholic family would, on assembling in the evening, discuss scholastic philosophy and such subjects. It is because, we suppose, our minds have become so deeply immersed in questions of state that we miss by contrast those manifestations of that profound education for which the most humble Irish catholic, thanks to the teaching of his pastors, was renowned throughout the world.72 67Daniel Corkery, The hidden Ireland: a study of Gaelic Munster in the eighteenth century (Dublin, 1924, repr. 1979), pp 5-16.

The fact that the Irish language and the 'cult of the Gael' to which a section of the language's advocates were committed generated a considerable body of uninspired, dull and vengeful writing is not a justification for viewing the language and the tradition with which it is bound as a philistine and retarding force. Its use as a psychological crutch for the culturally insecure and aggressive has tended to make its opponents seem balanced and urbane by contrast. Commitment to the language was not that of mere cultural triumph- alism. The majority of those who wrote publicly on the issue seem to have shared a love of the language while avoiding the self-pitying vision of it as the cornerstone of a 'Gaelic' hegemony into which the Irish Free State could crawl to lick the wounds of centuries. In time it became, like the issue of partition, an acid test for the patriot, but in the mid nineteen-twenties it seemed as if its future might be real. For some it was a question of pride: 'foreigners find nothing unique in what we do. We imitate others instead of being creative. We are a sad people. Only when we are creative do we became gay. It is by study of the Gaelic culture that we shall find the impulse to create.'73 There was a sense of public shame that is perhaps best illustrated in the fact that the president of the executive council delivered his St Patrick's day greeting in Irish using phonetic cards to pronounce the language he did not know. Hope for the language also lay in the fact that few of the intellectual Anglo-Irish were opposed to it. Their reservations were not related to the language itself but to the narrow cultural conformism that some of its proponents favoured. Many believed that the whole idea of viewing the civilisation that had manifested itself in Ireland through the English language as not quite the property of that mythical being 'the Gael' was in any case absurd and would have concurred with Francis Hackett when he wrote: The colonialism we detest cannot be fought without the Anglo-Irish. That is, the Irish. After all if an Irishman can be told to his face that he has been deplorably and totally Americanised in ten years why is it impossible for a Cromwellian to be Irished in two hundred? It can't work both ways and it wouldn't work both ways unless we were parochial and enslaved to false antithises. As for identifying Anglo-Irish culture with English blood it is a pseudo-science worthy of the Daily Mail.74 Like the hag of Beare some language enthusiasts preferred the sad dirge of loss to cheerful prophecies of rejuvenation. Many were not interested in the language itself but in the rhetoric of its ephemera. Their narrow provincial insecurities were to be a source of embarrassment to a constructive policy of language revival that was pro-Irish rather than anti-English. The inheritors of D. P. Moran's belief in the capacity of Ireland to be culturally introverted "Irish Statesman, 17 Jan. 1925. 74Ibid., 21 Feb. 1925.</page><page sequence="19">244 Irish Historical Studies declared all who were not with them to be against them. Those who remained within the Gaelic League during the twenties were frequently obscurantist, obsessed with precise grammatical rules and resentful of other language enthusiasts who did not live according to their narrow gospel. The Church of Ireland Gazette commented aptly on an attack from the Gaelic League on 'voyeuristic antiquarian amateurs': The Royal Irish Academy has for almost a century been an Irish academy, where the most eminent of Irish scholars have met together to advance knowledge in all departments of science and to foster the study of the archaeology of Ireland, its language and literature... It hardly makes for the advancement of the Irish language when discredit is given where credit is due for some ideal work done on behalf of the language. We do better service to any cause which interests us, when we applaud rather than find fault with those who to the best of ability and according to their circumstances have done it some service." Insecurity was the overriding factor in the cultural history of the first years after independence. A society that had fought for independence in defence of a notion of separate nationality found itself in the wake of independence confronting fundamental questions about what constituted that nationality. While there was no consciously-articulated 'quest for indentity', most of the ephemeral panegyrics on what Ireland 'ought to be' in the Catholic Bulletin and the Irish Statesman were attempts at some satisfactory self-definition. This article has suggested that independence brought to the surface deep-rooted fears about what songs, stories, repeated uprisings and the tradition of agrarian unrest and rejection of English law had symbolised: where did the core of difference, the justification for separateness lie? It is in the light of such central preoccupations that the period must be understood. It is in such a context that the issue of Gaelicisation acquires significance, and also in that context that the role of the catholic church is best understood. The compensatory self-images that both the rhetoric of Gaelicisation and the rhetoric of the church appropriated had common origins in uncertainty and doubt. Language and religion were the most obvious indicators of separate- ness. If the new question was the extent to which the notion of 'Ireland' had meaning when denied external opposition against which to define itself, then it is in the light of that concern that the period must be understood. There were tensions between 'Anglo-Irish' and 'Gaelic' answers to that question but to posit rigid categories of immutable opposition is to distort the reality. The majority of the Anglo-Irish, who might be more aptly referred to as the imperial Irish, adopted a fatalistic attitude towards a state the existence of which they had neither desired nor encouraged. A handful of intellectual nationalists many of whom were protestant - a reasonable characterisation of those who wrote for the Irish Statesman - abrogated the role of devil's advocate in monitoring the new state's uncertain struggle for self-definition. The cultural thrust of the period was concerned not with some mythic final struggle between Anglo-Irish and Gaelic culture but with a post-colonial search for a satisfactory 'national character'. That in the process the "7Church of Ireland Gazette, 3 Oct. 1924.</page><page sequence="20">O'CALLAGHAN - Language, nationality and cultural identity 245 sensibilities of those less interested in the revivification of a 'distinctive national being' were assailed is undeniable. But, to assume that all attempts at self-definition culminating in the government policy of Gaelicisation had no aim other than the defeat and wounding of a minority culture is absurd. Thus the statement of Lyons that Yeats's death outside the country was evidence of 'a certain poetic justice, for the country itself had been moving away from him for some years'"6 is symptomatic of a focus that distorts, by its assumptions of what was significant, the reality of the new state's beginnings.
