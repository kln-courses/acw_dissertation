<plain_text><page sequence="1">1909 January - June ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS' NOTES ON RECENT EXCAVATIONS AND DISCOVERIES; OTHER NEWS WILLIAM N. BATES, Editor 220, St. Mark's Square, Philadelphia, Pa. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONGRESS IN CAIRO. - In Kunstchr. XX, 1909, cols. 419-425, M. MiAAS gives an account of the recent archaeo- logical congress in Cairo. For two days the meetings were held in Alex- andria. Abb6 DusquBsne read an important paper on the sanctuaries at Aboukir. Theodor Schreiber showed that there really was an Alexandrian art with features of its own. H. Thiersch showed that the pharos built by Sostratus under Ptolemy Philadelphus in 280-279 B.c. stood on the site of Fort Kait and that from it developed the Egyptian minaret. He also gave a summary of the work done by his father and himself at the Serapeumrn in 1900-02. The director of the museum at Alexandria showed that the mania for garlands on the part of the ancient Alexandrians had no religious significance, but was simply due to sentiment. G. Steindorff discussed the excavations at the pyramid of Chephren. P. Cavvadias spoke on his excava- tions at Masakarata, Cephallonia, where he has recently opened twelve tombs with forty-seven graves intact. Mycenaean sherds, dating from the fifteenth to the twelfth century, B.c., were found, together with good vases of local manufacture, objects of gold, bronze, and glass. A. H. Smith dis- cussed fragments of the column of the Treasury of Atredis, now in the British Museum. Pierre Paris denied the early connection of Egypt and Spain, showing that the supposed evidence for such connection was a modern forgery. G. Karo argued that the Mycenaeans got their idea of inlaid 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books are conducted by Professor BATES, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor C.

Reinach argued that the sarcophagus of Hagia Triada shows Mycenaean-Egyptian connections. B. Sauer showed that the newly found Niobid in Rome is to be connected with the sculptures of the Theseum and with the Athena from Pergamon in Berlin, and argued that Lycius of Eleutherae, a pupil of Myron, may be the author. V. Staes dis- cussed a votive relief in Athens illustrating the story of Ion, but differing from the version of Euripides. I. N. Svoronos argued that the well-known figures of the boy with the goose and the boy removing a thorn from his foot were iniitended as representations of the sons of Asclepius. E. von Stern showed that the lonians of Naucratis had commercial dealings with Olbia as early as the seventh century B.C. The bronze and silver work of Alexandria had an important influence on southern Russia. Pharmakowski reported upon his excavations at Olbia. In the Byzantine section Charles Diehl read two important papers. He showed in one that there was an important Egyptian element in Byzantine art; and in the other that the Byzantine material in the tomb of Charlemagne dates from the second half of the tenth century, and that it was put into the tomb when it was opened by Otto in the year 1000. Spiridion Lambros told of his preliminary work for an Iconography of Byzantine emperors. NECROLOGY.- Frank Calvert.- Frank Calvert, American consul at Thymbra on the Dardanelles, died August 12, 1908. He was much inter- ested in the archaeology of the Troad, and published several articles on Trojan topography. (Z. Eth. XL, 1908, p. 922.) Georg Kawerau.--Georg Kawerau died April 13, 1909, at the age of fifty-two. He was an architect who did important work in the excavations at Miletus and at Didyma, as well as on the citadel of Pergamon. (A rch. Anz. 1909, cols. 73-74.) Abraham Leissauer.- Abraham Leissauer died September 30, 1908, at the age of seventy-six years. As a physician, he interested himself in sani- tary legislation, investigation of water impurities, etc., but prehistoric and anthropological studies took up a large part of his time in later life. His chief archaeological work is A ltertiimer der Bronzezeit der Provinz Westpreus- sen und der angrenzenden Ldnder, published in 1891. (Z. Eth. XL, 1908, p. 922.) August Mau. - On the 6th of March, 1909, August Mau died at Rome, three days after the death of his wife. He was born at Kiel in 1840, and while still a young man suffered so severely from pulmonary disease that his life was despaired of. But by living in Italy, at Rome and Naples (Pompeii), he prolonged his life many years. From 1873 he was connected with the German Archaeological Institute at Rome. His chief work was in connec- tion with Pompeii, which he knew more intimately than any other man except, perhaps, Fiorelli. To Mau is due the recognition of the four suc- cessive styles of Pompeian wall-paintings. His edition of Overbeck's Pompei and his Pompeii, its Life and Art, are known by all classical archaeologists. The two volumes of his Katalog der Bibliothek des Kaiserlich deutschen archaeo- logischen Instituts in Rom constitute a most valuable bibliography of archaeo- logical literature, and his numerous articles, chiefly in the R6m. Mitt., are distinguished by sound scholarship and learning. He was a man of great industry and equally great modesty, who took no pains to impress his merits upon the world, but whose death is felt as a great loss by all classical</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 347 archaeologists. (S. R., R. Arch. XIII, 1909, p. 262. Many other notices have been published.) Selah MIerrill. - On January 22, 1909, Dr. Selah Merrill died at Fruit- vale, California. He was born in 1837 at Canton Centre, Connecticut, and entered Yale University with the class of 1863, but left before graduation to enter the New Haven Theological Seminary. In 1874 he was appointed archaeologist of the American Palestine Exploration Society, a position which he resigned to become Professor of Hebrew at the Andover Theologi- cal Seminary. He served as United States consul at Jerusalem from 1882 to 1886 and from 1891 to 1894, and was appointed for the third time in 1898. While at Andover, he established the Biblical and Oriental Museum. He was an authority on the Holy Land and published many books and articles upon it. (Boston Herald, January 24, 1909.) Victor Rdcsey.- The death is announced of Dr. Victor Ricsey, one of the best-known archaeologists in Hungary. He was born in 1858 at Nagys- zombat, entered the Benedictine order, and became professor in 1884 at Sopron. In 1894 he became director of the library of the monastery of Pannonhalma. Among his works are L'Ancien nom de Sopron et les inscrip- tions romaines dans le comitat de Sopron; Les manuscrits et les incunables de la bibliothkque e'piscopale de Kassa; Les restes de l'e'glise Saint-Laurent h Eszter- gom; Fouilles dans la re'gion du lac Balaton; Les vestiges des communes ro- maines de Pannonie &amp; Esztergom ; Les inscriptions des anciens he'ros magyars, dans les catacombes romaines. (Polybiblion, 1908, pp. 466-467.) Ernst aus'm Weerth. - Professor Ernst aus'm Weerth, for many years director of the Rhenish Provincial Museum, has died at Bonn in his eightieth year. He was the author of Bad der riimischen Villa bei Allenz, Mosaikboden von St. Gereon zu CBln, and Wandmalereien des christlichen Mittelalters zu COln. (A then. April 17, 1909, p. 473.) SERVIA. - Excavations at Vinia in 1908.--In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 213-215 (pl.), MILOJE M. VASSITS describes and discusses dis- coveries made in 1908 at ViniSa, on the right bank of the Danube, about 15 km. below Belgrade (abbreviated by S. Reinach). Stone utensils, rude statuettes of terra-cotta (among them the first male terra-cotta statuette found in Servia), fragments of bone, obsidian, and other materials were found. Pottery of various kinds came to light, much of it ornamented with geometric designs. The anthropomorphic vases of the lowest stratum are contemporary with Troy II. This stratum owes its existence to a wave of civilization coming from the southeast. The upper strata at Vinia are contemporary with the seventh city at Troy. The prehistoric sites in Servia are briefly classified, and Vinia is placed in the earliest group. VACATION COURSES IN ARCHAEOLOGY FOR TEACH- ERS IN GERMANY.- Although the usual spring courses for teachers in Rome and Bavaria were omitted in 1908, four other meetings were held with great success. At Berlin, April 23-30, lectures were given at the Royal Museums, to twenty-eight hearers, by Erman, Delitzsch, E. Meyer, H. Schmidt, Zahn, Trendelenburg, Winnefeld, and Puchstein, each on his special subject. On April 9-11, with 150 in attendance, lectures were given at the University at Miinster on archaeological and literary subjects, by Cauer, Sonnenburg, Radermacher, Streitberg, and Kroll, and a visit was made to the excavations and museum at Haltern. In the Bonn-Treves</page><page sequence="4">348 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 course at Whitsuntide, forty-one hearers attended lectures by Loeschcke on all periods of ancient art, and visited, under guidance, the Provincial Museum at Bonn, the antiquities at Treves, and a portion of the Roman limes. At Dresden, where ancient alternates yearly with renaissance and modern art, lectures were given to twenty-one teachers, April 12-25, by Studniczka, Treu, and Herrmann. (Arch. Anz. 1908, cols. 445-447.) EGYPT GERMAN EXCAVATIONS IN 1908.- In Klio, IX, 1909, pp. 124- 131, L. BORCHARDT reports upon the excavations of German archaeologists in Egypt in 1908. At Elephantine the search for papyri was not especially successful. A few small Aramaic fragments were found, also some hieratic papyri in poor condition, and a considerable number in Greek of the second century A.D. The site of the temple of Jahwe, which was probably built of mud brick, has not yet been discovered. The foundations of part of the town wall and of several buildings south and west of the gateway of Alex- ander II, connected with the temple of Khnum, were uncovered. At Kom Ombo many Ptolemaic graves, most of which had been plundered, were opened in the cemetery 2 km. east of the temple. There were also found a number of tombs of the Middle Kingdom, one of which, that of a certain Sebekhotep, was adorned with paintings. At Abusir the mortuary temple of King Sahura of the fifth dynasty was excavated and a great quantity of reliefs found. There are representations of the king slaying Libyans, of ships returning from a successful expedition, of hunting scenes, etc. GREEK AND LATIN INSCRIPTIONS.- In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1909, pp. 144-165, SEYMOUR DE RICCI publishes thirteen Greek inscriptions from Egypt, including a late Christian inscription from Nubia, dated November 27, 1181 (see p. 376), some of which had been incorrectly published before; also two Latin inscriptions. He adds a list of the seventeen Coptic manuscripts recently found near Edfu. LETTERS FROM EGYPT.-- In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1908, pp. 791-804 (4 figs.), there are printed three letters from Egypt by SEYMOUR DE RICCI. He gives the text of nine unpublished Greek and Latin inscriptions, and one Carian inscription, the seventh known, which has been purchased for the Louvre. Brief mention is made of two recent acquisitions of the museum at Alexandria, a much-broken seated female figure, and the torso of a Nike, both of excellent workmanship. Various antiquities for sale by Egyptian dealers, manuscripts, papyri, funerary portraits, etc., of more or less archaeo- logical value are also recorded. MEMPHIS.- Recent Excavations. - Professor Flinders Petrie, in a lecture at University College, London, May 20, 1909, gave an interesting ac- count of his work at Memphis and Thebes during the past season. The chief discovery at Memphis was the palace of King Apries, - the Pharaoh Hophra of the Bible, - who was contemporary with Jeremiah. This palace was of impressive scale, about 400 feet long and half as wide. The middle court was over 100 feet square, with painted stone columns over 40 feet high. A still larger court extended on the north side, in which lie capitals of col- umns which must have been about 50 feet high. The approach to the palace led up through a large mass of buildings, to a platform at a height</page><page sequence="5">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 349 of about 60 feet above the plain. The roofing of the halls was by cedar beams. Pieces of these were found, one of them with an inscription carved on it. Amlnong the ruins were also discovered a large number of scales and plates of iron and bronze, which originally belonged to scale armor. The scales are sometimes quite thin, under half an inch long, sometimes stout- ribbed plates two inches long. Some good bronze figures of gods and sacred animals were also unearthed. But what gives an idea of the magnificence of the palace is a fitttng of a palanquin, of solid silver, a pound in weight, decorated with the bust of the goddess Hathor. The workmanship is of great beauty, though the object was merely an attachment for a strap to a wooden beam. It was found buried in a hole in the floor of a hall used for a workshop. As this is a unique specimen, it will remain in the Cairo museum. In several places traces of still older buildings than the Apries palace weme brought to light, such as the ruins of a large gateway of the twelfth dynasty. This was 20 feet high, and the greater part of six scenes which decorated it can still be put together. The sculpture is in low relief of much delicacy. The temple of King Proteus, Merenptah, which was dis- covered last year, has been partly cleared. It appears that, according to his usual habit, the king took his building materials from older works. Thus the capitals of columns found here are apparently of the fifth dynasty, like those seen in reliefs of that period. (Nation, June 10, 1909; pp. 590-591.) THEADELPHIA.- The Right of Asylum. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1908, pp. 772-782, G. LEFJBVRE publishes two stelae, bearing the same inscription, found at Batn-Herit, the ancient Theadelphia in the Arsinoite nome. They record the petition of the priests of the crocodile god Pnepheros to Berenice IV to confer upon their temple the right of asylum, and the granting of the petition. The limits of the asylum are carefully stated, and must have ex- tended far beyond the boundaries of the precinct. The petition is dated October 23, 57 B.c., and it was granted March 8, 56 B.c. Excavations are to be carried on at Batn-Herit by the Egyptian government, under the super- vision of M. Lefibvre. THEBES. - Recent Discoveries. - Before Memphis was dry enough to work the past season, two months were spent by Professor Flinders Petrie at Thebes, where the ruins on top of the mountain were explored. They were found to be a chapel for the apotheosis of King Sankh-ka-ra, of the eleventh dynasty; it contained the pieces of the cenotaph and the Osiris statue of the king. Two of the desert valleys were exhaustively searched for concealed burials, and one untouched group was found. The coffin was covered only by about a foot of earth and stones. Around it were offerings of furniture, food, vases, and personal ornaments. On the mummy were a gold collar of four rows of rings, four gold bangles, earrings, and a girdle of electrum. This is one of the most complete burials known. Other inter- esting discoveries at Thebes were the clearing of a new temple site, two fine stone figures, and an untouched burial of the twenty-fifth dynasty. (Nation, June 10, 1909, p. 591.) SYRIA AND PALESTINE BEERSHEBA. - A Fragment of a Byzantine Edict. - In R. Bibl. XVI, 1909, pp. 89-106 (pl.; 3 figs.), F. M. ABEL describes an inscription discovered at Beersheba and purchased by B. W. Robinson of the American</page><page sequence="6">350 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 School of Oriental Research. The first five lines are badly preserved, and seem to contain an extract from an imperial edict. The sixth and seventh lines describe the carrying out of the decree. The protocols of the Code of Justinian offer the nearest parallels to this text. DAMASCUS.- Two Unpublished Palmyrene Inscriptions. - In J.A.O.S. XXIX, 1908, p. 203, H. H. SPOER publishes two Palmyrene inscriptions now in the possession of a gentleman at Damascus. GEZER. - Report on the Excavations. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLI, 1909, pp. 13-25 (7 figs.), R; A. S. MlACALISTER describes the results of the excava- tions at Gezer from August 11 to November 10,1908 (see A.J.A. XII, pp. 86-87, 357; XIII, p. 75). The joining of the two pits, that of the Central Valley and the Eastern Hill, is described. Another cave-cemetery has been found, with a low chamber measuring about 25 feet each way and about 7 feet high, con- taining the remains of four persons, but no remarkable small objects; the pottery belonged to the normal early Second Semitic types. The most inter- esting find is three specimens of a peculiar type of "Astarte-Plaque," showing a face with strongly marked, peculiar features, and wearing a veil, with em- broidered border, which covers the head and falls over the shoulders, such as has not been previously found on plaques from Gezer (but compare with this the figure of a veiled goddess recently found at Tell Halaf and mentioned in A.J.A. XIII, p. 74). The figure shows a profusion of ornament and holds over the breast a circular object difficult to explain; a peculiar feature of the goddess is the presence of six fingers on each hand. Certain inscribed tablets were also found, one with lines in a pattern not explained, and a second bearing a Hebrew inscription, an interpretation of which is given, ibid. pp. 26-34 (2 figs.). Among the other finds are a good specimen of an ivory inlay; another Old-Hebrew jar-seal; a die; a fragment of pottery from the Fourth Semitic period painted with a design of the octopus; two bronze objects of uncertain use, but possibly intended as supports from which to suspend two fine bronze pots, found in the same cistern, which resemble cooking pots, and have two vertical loop handles projecting above the rim; and another so-called votive-altar with a human figure, possibly a woman, on horseback, which is compared with the vase-painting of the Libyan horse- woman from Daphnae (see Ridgeway's Origin and Influence of the Thorough- bred Horse, p. 243). HAURAN. - Latin Inscriptions. - In Rom.-Germn. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 36-37, A. voN DOMASZEWSKI publishes two Latin inscriptions found by the Princeton expedition in the Hauran, one at Il-Kafr and the other at Bostra. NABLUS.- Twelve New Samaritan Inscriptions.- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXX, 1908, pp. 284-291 (5 pls.), H. H. SPOER publishes notes on inscriptions found at Nablus, some with sunk letters on Mount Ebal, others among the ruins of houses in and about the town. SAKJE-GEUZI.- The Recent Excavations.- In Annals of Archae- ology and Anthropology, I, 1908, pp. 97-117 (17 pls.), J. GARSTANG publishes a preliminary report of his excavations at Sakje-Geuzi in northern Syria in 1908 (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 77). There are five mounds on the site, all of which contain ancient remains, but the smallest alone was excavated. The main results attained were these: (1) The discovery of a fortification wall 3.50 m. thick, built of small stones faced with larger blocks, and dating</page><page sequence="7">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 351 between 1100 and 850 B.c. (2) Upper buildings were found superimposed in the centre of the mound. They consist of modern walls resting on walls of a Roman building, below which are the remains of a structure of about 300 B.C., and lower still a portico of the Hittite period. (3) This portico belonged to a temple or palace, not yet uncovered, and is adorned with Hittite sculptures. (4) A trench was cut beyond the main wall, showing the neolithic origin of the mound with stratified deposits, which will serve as a means of dating subsequent finds. The sculptures consist of seventeen reliefs, for the most part finely preserved. In the middle of the portico, and set back a little from the step, is a drum-shaped pedestal supported by two sphinxes, probably the base for a column. The reliefs are to the right and left along the side walls. On either side is a procession conisisting of a lion followed by a man-headed, winged monster, which in turn is followed by three men, one of whom carries a falcon. Another slab shows two men fertilizing the sacred tree. These sculptures probably date from about 850 B.C., and although the motives are Assyrian, they seem to be the work of local artists. The neolithic pottery falls into two main classes, a black incised ware and a painted ware. The latter resembles pottery found by de Morgan at Susa and dated by him in the time of Naram-Sin. SAMARIA. - The Excavations of 1908.- In The Harvard Theological Review, II, 1909, pp. 102-113 (3 plans; 18 figs.), D. G. LYON reports upon the results of the first year's work of the Harvard expedition to Samaria. Work was begun April 24, 1908 and continued with interruptions to August 21. Five trial pits were dug at a spot near the village revealing the presence of a large building, the northern end of which was excavated. It was prob- ably a Roman temple. About two hundred Arabic lamps, masses of Roman roof tiles, Greek and Roman pottery and broken glass were found here. More important results were obtained on the citadel. One trench below the summit uncovered at a depth of thirty feet a massive wall supposed to be Hebrew; while another revealed two cisterns, a plastered stone drain, and remains of ancient buildings. On the summit there was found to the north a great stairway originally eighty feet broad and still consisting of sixteen steps. Below is another step of softer stone, and there may have been one or two more at the top. At the foot of this stairway is a supporting wall about eight feet high. Above it, about twelve feet to the south, is a paved platform now about fifty-seven by twenty-seven feet, and beyond this a mas- sive wall extending the length of the platform and running back at right angles to it. These are probably the walls of a temple. On the eastern side the wall was followed for 135 feet. Beneath the platform are remains of earlier walls. West of the stairway, and on a level with the lowest step, a chamber about forty by twenty feet with massive walls was excavated. Other walls as yet unexplored run off to the north and west. A few Greek graffiti and many fragments of Latin inscriptions came to light during the excavations; the only sculptures were a Roman torso, probably of Augustus, and pieces of a large head. A short distance north of the stairway was found an altar about thirteen feet from east to west and half as wide; and beyond this a square pit in which a column cut out of the natural rock still stands in its original position. Fragments of painted stucco were dis- covered here with Greek letters scratched on then.</page><page sequence="8">352 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 ASIA MINOR A JOURNEY IN PONTUS AND CAPPADOCIA.- In B.C.H. XXXIII, 1909, pp. 3-169 (3 pls.; 23 figs.), H. GREGOIRE gives a prelimnii- nary report of a journey in Pontus and Cappadocia. The topographical and epigraphical results are to be more fully discussed in the Studia Pontica; a special publication will be devoted to the Byzantine churches of Cappa- docia. In the present article a brief account of the journey is given. One hundred and twenty inscriptions are published, including all the known inscriptions of Caesarea (Nos. 23-67), and some of the churches are described. KARA DAGH. - New Hittite Inscriptions. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXI, 1909, pp. 83-87 (2 pls.), A. H. SAYCE describes six inscriptions dis- covered by W. M. Ramsay and Miss Bell, on an isolated hill called Kizil Dagh and on Kara Dagh, and endeavors to give a translation of them. EKUL TEPE. - Miscellaneous Antiquities.- In Rec. Past, VIII, 1909, pp. 93-96 (3 figs.), ISABEL F. DODD gives a brief account of certain antiqui- ties in her possession from Kul Tepe, a few miles north of Caesarea Cappa- docia. These consist of celts of flint, black stone, and jade; whorls; animal heads of clay; vases; Cappadocian tablets; Babylonian weights of hema- tite; a Hittite seal cylinder; and many small antiquities of the Greek period. MILETUS AND DIDYMA.--A Report of the Excavations. - The results of nine years' excavation at Miletus and of a shorter term at Didyma were summarized by T. Wiegand and H. Borrmann at the March (1908) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. Among the most im- portant discoveries are : the seventh-century city wall of Miletus, which had a circuit one-half larger than the Hellenistic city; the Senate House, 170 B.C., a typical Hellenistic public building and an example of the partial mix- ture of Ionic and Doric that marks that period in Asia Minor;:a fine Hel- lenistic gymnasium; the temple for the worship of King Eumenes II, as head of the Pan-lonians, the first temple of this kind to be identified; two magnificent Roman baths; details of the great temple at Didyma, 108 x 55 m.; and a number of long inscriptions concerned with the erection and use of these buildings, with the education of boys, and with the his- torical relations of the places. (Arch. Anz. 1908, cols. 499-507.) PERGAMON.- The Recent Excavations. - In Ath. ilitt. XXXIII, 1908, pp. 327-374 (5 pls.; 7 figs.), W. DORPFELD reports upon the excava- tions of 1906 and 1907. The western half of the upper gymnasium on the south slope of the citadel and the region adjoining it on the west were un- covered. The central court (74 x 36 m.) was completely cleared, and proved to have been surrounded in Roman times by two storied marble colonnades of the Corinthian order which took the place of earlier Doric colonnades of trachyte. On the north side of the court the excavation of the central hall and of a small theatre was completed. At the west three halls were found, the central one being a bath. The covered stadium below the southern colonnade was also cleared. The remains to the west of the gymnasium in- cluded a temple, perhaps of Asclepius. In addition to the work on this main site, the Greek city wall at the southwest corner of the citadel and a Greek bridge over the Selinus were investigated. In the plain two small tumuli</page><page sequence="9">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 353 yielded each a trachyte sarcophagus, with contents undisturbed. The attempt to reach the centre of the largest tumulus, Jiquia-Tepeh, was continued. A brief report of the excavations in 1908 is given, ibid. pp. 372-374. The large Roman baths at the eastern end of the terrace of the upper gymnasium were uncovered, and two Greek buildings, one perhaps the prytaneum, were found at the west end. The centre of the Jiquia-Tepeh was reached, but no grave was found. The search for the sepulchral chamber will be continued. Frescoes in the House of the Consul Attalus. - A drawing of the best- preserved wall which is decorated in the style of the frescoes of Prima Porta shows a socle at the bottom of the wall, divided into three panels by two pilasters. Each of these supports a cantharus with two birds perching on the rim. Above, a meadow is indicated in perspective, with various bloom- ing plants painted in bright colors on a light red background. (P. SCHAZ- MAN, Ath. Mlitt. XXXIII, 1908, pp. 437-441; fig.) Inscriptions. - Seventy inscriptions, found during the excavations of 1906 and 1907, are published by P. JACOBSTHAL in Ath. Mitt. XXXIII, 1908, pp. 375-420 (pl.). Among them are 5 decrees, 18 lists of ephebi, 10 dedica- tions, and 15 honorary inscriptions. Minor Discoveries.- The small finds of the years 1906 and 1907 are discussed by P. JACOBSTUAL in Ath. Mitt. XXXIII, 1908, pp. 421-436 (3 pls.). A marble torso, of a style recalling the Gigantomnachy, may be a fragment of a seated Asclepius, the cult statue of the temple mentioned above. One of the sarcophagi, that of a man, contained a gold wreath of oak leaves and acorns, two swords, two dogs' heads of gold, which apparently belonged to the swords, and five pairs of sheep. In the second sarcophagus, that of a woman, no gold ornaments were found. There were remains of myrtle wreaths with wooden stems, stalks and leaves of bronze, and buds and berries of gilded clay. Both graves contained a number of lecythi of alabaster. The date is to be placed early in the age of the Pergamene kingdom. GREECE EXCAVATIONS IN BOEOTIA AND PHOCIS. --In IIpCLKTLKC for 1907 (published 1908), pp. 108-112, G. SOTERIADES gives an account of the excavations carried on by him in Boeotia and Phocis in 1907. At Chaero- nea the orchestra of the theatre was excavated, but nothing of importance discovered. A short distance below, there were found statue bases of Ro- man date and monolithic columns, together with remains of Greek times. At Orchomenus the excavation of the great tomb was completed, and it was shown to resemble the much smaller pre-Mycenaean tomb at Drachmani. At Vranezi, near by, tombs of the geometric period yielded some fine vases and a few small objects of gold. At Exarchos, the ancient Abae, in Phocis many tombs were opened, from which came vases of the fifth and fourth centuries, terra-cottas, small bronzes, terra-cotta larnaces, grave stelae, and gold and silver ornaments. The common meeting-place of the Phociaus, mentioned by Pausanias, was located at Kephalovrysos, but excavation brought to light nothing of importance. The site of the 27xr~ 'O80s of the Oedipus story is to be placed at Davelaiika, where part of an ancient wagon road has been found, with remains of prehistoric houses near by, rather than at Stene. At Distomos, the ancient Ambrosus, Greek and Roman graves</page><page sequence="10">354 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 containing objects of gold and silver were opened. Late inscriptions were found in the foundations of the church which seems to occupy the site of an ancient temple. South of Distomos, near the sea, an ancient city was found which may have been Marathus. The acropolis is now called Hagios Theodoros. Many undisturbed tombs of the Mycenaean period were found, as well as others of later date. Gold bracelets from the geometric tombs, quantities of vases of all periods, statuettes, and "island stones" were re- moved to the museum at Chaeronea. The Mycenaean tombs were rec- tangular, with sloping walls built of small stones, and covered with slabs placed at an angle. A few steps led down to the entrance. The geometric tombs were pits full of burnt fragments. AMYCLAE. - The Excavations of 1907.--In IIfpcKTLKo for 1907 (published 1908), A. N. SKIAS reports upon the excavations carried on at Amyclae after the death of Furtwlingler, chiefly by his pupil, Fichter. The hope of finding the foundations of the throne of Apollo under the church of Hagia Kyriake was not realized, although some fragments, including two small columns of a mixed style, Doric and Ionic, may belong to that monu- mnent. A little below the top of the hill, part of the temple enclosure was uncovered, near which were found many small dedicatory vases and sherds, chiefly geometric, though a few were earlier and a few of later date. A small bronze statuette of a nude youth wearing a helmet and in the attitude of jumping was found near the foot of the hill, although no excavating has as yet been done at that place. It is now in the museum at Sparta. ATHENS. - An Italian Archaeological School. - It is announced that through the efforts of the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione anl appropriation has been made for the establishment of an Italian archaeo- logical school at Athens (Boll. Arte, II, 1908, p. 479). A villa has been rented, and the school will be opened in the autumn of 1909. At present the field work will be limited to supplementing the Italian excavations in Crete. (Nation, June 10, 1909, p. 591.) The Restoration of the Erechtheum. - In IIpaKTLK4 for 1907 (pub- lished 1908), pp. 125-128 (pl. of 4 figs.), N. M. BALANOS reports upon the progress made in the restoration of the Erechtheum in 1907. The whole of the frieze on the east front, together with the corner slab at the southeast end, has been put in place, and above the frieze the portions of the cornice which still exist. The greater part of the cella wall on the south side has been built up out of existing blocks as far as the architrave. CRETE. - LATO. - New Inscriptions. - In 'Eh. 'ApX. 1908, pp. 197- 244 (fig.), S. A. XANTHOUDIDES publishes twenty-four inscriptions from various places in Crete, the majority from Lato (HIagios Nikolaos), on the Gulf of Mirabello. The more interesting of them date from about the second century B.C. Among them are a votive inscription recording repairs and restorations made by the Hierapytnians in the Dictaean sanctuary at Palaikastro, fragments of three treaties of Lato, a boundary inscription, and a votive inscription recording the building of temples to Athena Dera- mitis (?) and to Eileithyia, and a peribolus surrounding them. An appendix contains notes and corrections on eight Cretan inscriptions published within the last twenty years. DELOS.-- A Bilingual Inscription.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1908, pp. 546-560 (fig.), C. CLERMONT-GANNEAU publishes a bilingual inscrip-</page><page sequence="11">GREECEJ ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 355 tion, Minaean and Greek, recently found in a house northeast of the agora of Theophanes at Delos. It is a dedication to the god Oaddos (Waddunm) carved on a conical base or altar. No other such inscription is known. According to various German scholars, the Minaean kingdom came to an end in the eighth century B.c., but this inscription to the Minaean national god dates from the second century B.c. In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 59-60, F. HOMMEL shows that the Minaean inscription is much older than the Greek paraphrase which accompanies it. It points to the existence of a South Arabian colony in the Greek islands at an early date. Adramytion is connected etymologically with Hadramaut. Waddum is another name for Hubal, and from Hubal the Greek name Apollo is derived. The mother of Hubal is al-Lat, from which Leto, the mother of Apollo, is derived. This inscription is likewise discussed, ibid. cols. 60-65, by O. WEBER, who also comes to the conclusion that the Greek text is much later than the Minaean which accompanies it, and is a rude attempt at giving its sense by a secondary hand. This conclusion he confirms by the absence of the names of the dedicators from the Greek text, the lack of exactness in the translation, and the date of the Greek type of writing. The Minaean letters show very curious forms, which may perhaps be due to the fact that they were cut by sculptors who were unfamiliar with the Minaean alphabet. DELPHI. - Recent Discoveries in the Sacred Precinct. - In Berl. Phil. W. XXIX, Nos. 5 to 12, and 24 to 26, H. POMTOW reports upon his researches and excavations at Delphi in the fall of 1908. The most im- portant results were: (1) The finding of the Treasury of the Corinthians. Unable to agree with Homolle, who had located it on the so-called " terrasse infe'rieure," a position not to be reconciled with the accounts of either Plu- tarch or Pausanias, Pomntow fixed on the oblong structure at the southeast bend of the Sacred Way, which had been identified by Homolle as the base supporting the chariot dedicated by Cyreue, as the only possible site of the Corinthian Treasury. Excavations soon showed that the structure extended much farther west and north than the French plans show, its real dimen- sions being 5.75 m. by 8.55 m., the usual proportions of a treasury. The stones which the French excavators had thought to form the northern wall in reality proved to be blocks forming the pavement of the Treasury, still found in situ, and extending farther to the north. It was found impracti- cable to excavate the western side of the Treasury further on account of the masses of earth under which it was buried, and of the nearness of the Sacred Way. An inscription, now in the basement of the museum, which reads in large archaic letters K OR I N [OwV], belonged to this, the oldest of the treasuries. (2) Second in importance, Pomtow considers the bringing to light of the remains of the Tholos of Sicyon, which were used as a solid foundation for the treasury later built on this site. Closely and carefully packed together were found thirteen columns, with capitals, architraves, round triglyphs with metopes, circular steps and wedgeshaped pavement- stones, rounded on both sides. The Tholos can now be entirely reconstructed. It stood on a circular platform 6.40 m. in diameter and consisted of thirteen slender columns without any inner wall. From the fact that architectural fragments were found on the site, not circular in form (especially two archi- traves of the same dimensions as the round ones), Pomtow conjectures that a small portal with four columns in front formed the entrance to the Tholos;</page><page sequence="12">356 AMERICAN JOIURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 and further concludes that the archaic sculptured slabs which had been found on this site (representing the bull carrying off Europa, the Calydonian boar, the Argo, Idas and the Dioscuri; see Furtwvingler in Berl. Phil. W. 1894, p. 1275) served as metopes or as a continuous frieze to this portal. The style of the capitals and sculptures points to the early sixth century. The Tholos may have been erected by Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, between 580 and 570 B.c., and in view of the researches of H. Thiersch (see his 'Antike Bauten fiir Musik,' Zeitschr. f. Geschichte d. Architektlur, II, pp. 27-50), Pomtow holds it to have been built to serve a musical purpose. In later years it was pulled down by the Sicyonians who erected a treasury in the usual style. Of further results of Pomtow's campaign the following may be mentioned: Of the round pedestal of the statue of Phaylus eleven fragments were found. Fresh measurements of the Lysander monument show that the statues of the admirals were placed in the chamber along the back wall. In the semicircular monument of the Argive kings the original position of all the bases of the statues on the lower pedestals has now been ascertained. It was shown that the bases of the principal statues bore epi- grams. Through the deciphering of the letters INO on the upper side of the base of the monument of the Tarentines, the identification of its site is now assured. The large tithe-stones found near by belonged to it. Of the offering of the Cnidians a stone belonging to the base was found in the parodos of the theatre, with an inscription reading KvI/Sot rl 'AwTOXXwOvt &amp;r r~t wro~cplwv &amp;EKLTV. This block is the largest one thus far found at Delphi. Of the two treas- uries identified by Homolle as those of the Cnidians (the larger one) and of the Megarians (the smaller one to the north) Pomntow identifies the latter as that of the Cnidians, the other that of the Siphnians. The sculptured frieze and the large Caryatids belong to this last treasury; probably also the awkward gable-sculptures. Pomtow dates the building of the Cnidian Treasury between 546 and 541 B.c., and the Siphnian before 525 B.c. The identity of the large, oblong structure west of the Siphnian Treasury is now established by an inscription (&amp;)rw Tvpoav(Sv). It bore the offerings of the Lipareans. The Theban Treasury is Homolle's Boeotian Treasury. The Athenian Treasury has been reconstructed, unfortunately partly with ma- terial that seems to have belonged to that of the Cnidians. The gables also had sculptures of which the subject seems to have been the carrying off of the tripod. Two new slabs were found. Back of the Athenian Treasury are two others, one of Potidaea (the smaller to the north), the other of Syracuse (to the south). The base of the bronze goat of Cleonae, consisting of eleven blocks, has been found; the image itself was of huge proportions. The long structure to the south of the Sibyl's Rock, along the Sacred Way, on the left side, Pomntow thinks, supported the bases and statues of the &amp;ratpaL. The treasury, southeast of the newly discovered site of the Corin- thian Treasury, built against the wall of the sacred precinct must have been that of the Boeotians (not mentioned by Pausanias) erected after the Pho- cian War (346 B.C.). Material and style prove it to be the latest of the treasuries at Delphi. Homolle's Corinthian Treasury, Pomtow holds to be that of Clazomenae. The building south of the Boeotian Treasury which</page><page sequence="13">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 357 Homolle ascribed to Cyrene, he identifies as the Treasury of the Massiliots and Romans. The remains prove it to belong to the end of the fifth or the beginning of the fourth century, and an honorary decree mentions 'IEpoKXi IVpwvos vLpaKovoLos, the friend of the Romans. Only three foundations of treasuries remain now to be identified: the so-called "yellow house" and the two to the east of the Theatre. From Pomtow's topographical survey it follows that Pausanias has enumerated only the buildings and monuments situated on the Sacred Way; but also that none of these were left unmen- tioned by him with the exception of the Council House and the Treasury of the Acanthians and Brasidas. In addition Pomtow publishes a number of inscriptions, the most interesting one from a base which supported the statue of that famed *rEpLoSovtKts Theogenes, son of Timoxenus, of Thasos (in the editions of Pausanias both names are given wrongly as Theagenes and Timosthenes). The total number of his victories is here given as 1300 (Plutarch, 1200; Pausanias, 1400), and it is also shown that the list of vic- tories from the well-known base in Olympia must be referred to this same athlete and not to Dorieus, as Foucart supposed. The real list of Dorieus's victories is the one published by Hughes, Trarels, p. 365 (C.L.G. 1715). EUBOEA.- Various Discoveries.- In IHpKTLKdC for 1907 (published 1908), pp. 114-119, G. A. PAPAVASILEIOU gives an account of his excava- tions in Euboea in 1907. At Chalcis five tombs of the classical period were opened, one of which was 3 m. long, 2 m. wide, and 1.60 m. high. This had two benches, one 1.20 m. high, and the other 0.40 m. high, upon each of which lay a skeleton. Vases of two new shapes were found: a prochous with a long neck and beak-like mouth, and a peculiar black cup with its edges bent outward. Besides the tholos tomb excavated at Oxylithos (A.J.A. XII, p. 362), one was uncovered at Vrusaki and another at Bellusia, but nothing of importance was found in them. At a place called Ptelea, at Oxylithos, remains of a building 8.35 m. by 6.17 m., built of large stones, were found. This was probably a temple. At Eretria seven tombs were opened in one place and ten in another, all of the classical period, contain- ing vases and some jewellery. KAKOVATOS. -- Recent Discoveries. -In addition to the three bee-hive tombs excavated by Ddrpfeld in 1907 and 1908 at Kakovatos (A.J.A. XIII, p. 79), there have now been discovered other tombs of the same kind. On the top of a hill D6rpfeld has found remains of a temple with numerous cultus objects and ex-votos, which suggest that it was a shrine of Artemis Limnetis. (Hellenic Herald, III, 1909, pp. 35-36.) MEGALOPOLIS. - Recent Excavations. - In IIpaLKKd for 1907 (published 1908), pp. 122-125, K. STEPHANOS describes his excavations in the vicinity of Megalopolis. At Vromosella some unimportant tombs were opened. At the site of the ancient Trapezus foundation blocks and many vase fragments came to light. At Choune, where the MeyJdoL ?Eoi were worshipped, foundation blocks, vases, and terra-cottas, some of which were archaic, were found. West of Megalopolis four tombs were excavated, but without important results. OLYMPIA. - Prehistoric Remains. - The importance of pre-Dorian Olympia is established by Dorpfeld's recent investigations. Excavations around the Metroon and the Treasuries have brought to light remains of small dedicatory temples of prehistoric date. In a black, sandy stratum</page><page sequence="14">358 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 were discovered sherds and other earthenware objects, which in their form and incised decoration show close affinity to the pottery found on neolithic sites. (Nation, May 27, 1909, p. 545.) PAGASAE. - Recent Discoveries. -Five more towers have been found at Pagasae by A. S. Arvanitopoullos, all dating from about 50 B.c. One is about 40 m. wide, and for a space of about 30 m. is full of painted grave stelae (see A.J.A. XII, pp. 103, 364-365; XIII, p. 211). Within the town are remains of a stoa about 56 m. long, dating from the fourth or third century B.C., and near it is a small temple. The agora, which was in this vicinity, was apparently large and contained several other buildings. (Hellenic Herald, III, 1909, p. 35.) SPARTA. - Recent Excavations. - At a meeting at the British School at Athens, January 22, 1909, R. Mni. Dawkins described the work of the preceding season at the temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta. In order to reach the level of the pavement of the sacred enclosure, a considerable portion of the Roman amphitheatre was removed. Several inscribed stelae, including one showing the faCade of the sixth-century temple in relief, were discovered during the process. A short distance south of the archaic temple were found remains of a still older building, which had crude brick walls and a cella divided lengthwise by a single row of wooden columns. Numner- ous small objects came to light, including terra-cottas, lead figurines, carved ivories, and pottery. The last was especially important, as showing the development at Sparta of what has hitherto been called Cyrenaic ware. The speaker pointed out that there was a gradual decadence in the indus- trial arts at Sparta from the seventh to the fifth century, which he attributed to the military constitution. (Athen. February 6, 1909, p. 174.) Mycenaean Remains. - In excavating the so-calledd Menelaon at Sparta remains of Mycenaean date, consisting of bits of fresco painting and pot- sherds, were brought to light from beneath the monument and in an adjoin- ing building. These are the first Mycenaean remains found at Sparta. The Menelaon is built of large blocks, and apparently dates from the fifth cen- tury B.C. A little below it a number of bronze and lead votive offerings, dating from the seventh century, were found, including beads, axes, fibulae, and plaques; also a large number of terra-cottas. (Nation, June 17, 1909, p. 613.) SUNIUM. -- Discoveries South of the Temple of Poseidon. - In IIpaKTLKd for 1907 (published 1908), pp. 102-104, V. STAES gives briefly the results of his excavations at Suniuin in 1907 south of the temple of Poseidon (see A.J.A. XII, pp. 95, 366). A few additional pieces of the colossal statues, which he regards as Apollos, were found; but the most important discoveries were made in a pit of pre-Persian date. Here he found about fifty scarabs; twelve gems, some of which are engraved; two vultures of Egyp- tian porcelain; two fragmentary statuettes of Egyptian divinities; a terra- cotta ex-voto in the shape of a foot; about one hundred small geometric and Protocorinthian vases; a small bronze figure of a warrior; and many pieces of terra-cotta tablets, some painted and some with reliefs, represent- ing Heracles wrestling with the lion. THASOS. - New Inscriptions.- A number of new Greek inscrip- tions and one in Latin, several of them in facsimile, together with biblio- graphical and other notes on previously known Thasian inscriptions, are</page><page sequence="15">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 359 published by J. BAKER-PENOYRE and MI. N. TOD in J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 91-102 (3 figs.). The earliest go back to the fifth, and perhaps to the sixth, century B.C., and are in the local alphabet. THESSALY. --The Excavations of 1907. - In IIpaKTLK6 for 1907 (published 1908), pp. 147-182 (2 pls. of 4 figs. each), A. S. ARVANITOPOUL- Los describes the excavations in Thessaly in 1907. At Pharsalos, on the site of some Turkish baths near the northwest corner of the modern market-p!ace, remains of a stoa of the fourth or third century B.c., with Ionic columns, were found. A Turkish mosque, built of ancient materials on the top of a hill, seems to occupy the site of a temple of Zeus Thaulius. At Pherae, remains of a small marble building, apparently in the shape of a templum in antis, were discovered near the larger of the two mounds northeast of the town. It dates from the fourth or third century .c., and is probably the shrine of a local hero. Near the church of Hagios Charalampous, remains of a small Doric building of the fifth or fourth century B.C. are shown by inscriptions on vases to belong to a temple of Heracles. Some of the pottery dates from the sixth century .c., and it is expected that further excavations will reveal an earlier shrine. Near the place called Mati prehistoric remains were found; and along the road leading from the large mill to Velestino pieces of Doric columns seem to indicate the site of a temple. At Phthiotic Thebes the stoa already known was examined, and found to have been double, with wooden columns. Near by were some house walls, and to the south of it the foundations of a poros temple 19.30 m. long and 14.08 m. wide. On the acropolis, portions of a temple, probably that of Athena Polias, were uncovered, as well as prehistoric remains. At Demetrias the walls seen by Dodwell, and believed to belong to a temple, were probably those of a church. At Pagasae the most important find was the painted stelae (A.J.A. XII, pp. 103, 364-365; XIII, p. 211); but the theatre was partially excavated, and some of the architectural fragments belonging to it found in a late building which covers the stage and part of the orchestra. ITALY CELLA DATI. - Prehistoric Remains. - The description of objects in stone, bronze, terra-cotta, etc., found near Cremona at the neolithic settle- ment of Cella Dati, is continued by G. PATRONI in B. Pal. It. IV, 1908, pp. 192-210 (pl.; 4 figs.). CHIUSI. - An Attic Vase. - At Chiusi, in a tomb which had been rifled, there were found fragments of a red-figured Attic vase of the fifth century B.C. (Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, p. 582.) PERENTO. -Inscriptions from the Baths. --Excavations have dis- closed the site of the thermae of the ancient city, from which two inter- esting inscriptions of good period have been recovered entire, one to MARTI ? AVG, the other in honor of a certain L. Pomponius Lupus, quin- queinalis iterum, who had served as tribune of the fourth Macedonian legion, and as prefect of a cohort of Macedonian and of Lusitanian cavalry, and of Baliarians. (Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 373-381; figs.) FLORENCE. - Acquisitions of the Museo Nazionale. - The Museo Nazionale of Florence has recently acquired 140 ancient seals from the col- lection of Giuseppe Salvatore. (Boll. Arte, II, 1908, p. 478.)</page><page sequence="16">360 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 FONDI.- An Inscription of the Gens Trebia.- A sepulchral inscrip- tion with four names, found between Fondi and Sperlonga, gives the first in- stance of the mention of the gens Trebia in the territory of the ancient Fundi. (Not. Scav. 1908, p. 391.) MARANOLA (FORMIAE). - Inscription of a Mamurra.- A frag- mentary stone of the first century A.D., with the words AVFILLIAE ? P ? M A M V R RA E, furnishes the first occurrence of the name Mamurra in an in- scription from the native region of Caesar's famous praefectus fabrum. The only other epigraphic occurrence of the name is on a stone from Thibilis (Numidia), where a M. Vitrunius Mamurra is mentioned (C.I.L. VIII, 18913). G. Q. GIGLIOLI conjectures that this Vitrunius Mamurra must have derived his name from Latin stock, and that, as Vitrunii were common about Formiae, the famous Mamurra may have been of that gens. (Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 391-394.) MARINO. - A Prehistoric Grave. - An ossuary from the cemetery of Marino displays fictile ware like that found in other early graves of the same region, but fibulae of the early Iron Age, the burial belonging, accordingly, to a somewhat later period than most of the early Latian burials thus far recorded. (Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 346 f.) OSTIA.--An Oriental Sanctuary.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1909, pp. 181-191 (fig.), D. VAGLIERI gives a brief account of the sanctuary of an oriental divinity recently found at Ostia in a street connecting with the Street of the Tombs. It is 12.15 m. long and 5.60 m. wide, and has the appearance of a temple of Mithra. An inscription found in the excavations seems to prove that it was dedicated to Jupiter Sabazius, the Phrygian Sabazis. A Roman Dupondius. - In August, 1908, a hoard of 400 to 500 pieces of Roman bronzes of republican times was found by workmen at Ostia, and divided among themselves. Fr. GNECCHI came later into possession of 176 pieces, among them a single specimen, the third known, of a struck dupon- dius, one of the second, and last, republican issues of this denomination. It is pictured, described, and discussed in R. Ital. Numrn. XXII, 1909, pp. 11-19, by the owner, who argues that the reduction of the as to the crucial stand- ard must have taken place as late as the period between 159 and 112 B.c. PALESTRINA. - Roman Weights. - A remarkable series of Roman weights has been discovered in an ancient well at Palestrina. They are of basalt, and duly marked II, III, V, X (librae), and I, If, III (unciae), each numeral being enclosed in a circle with a tail, resembling a Q. From the fact that they were found near the basilica, and for other reasons, it has been conjectured that they were standard weights. (M. LAZZARINI, B. Com. Rom. XXXVI, 1908, pp. 69-76.) POMPEII. - Recent Excavations. - The work continued at Pompeii in Reg. VI, Ins. 16, Nos. 35-40, disclosed two small houses and a shop, in which were found a considerable number of small objects of no unusual character, and a few fair wall-paintings, one representing possibly a recita- tion scene. (A. SOGLIANO, Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 359-370; 3 figs.) A New Villa. - An exceptionally fine villa has been discovered on private land within six hundred feet of the point in Pompeii where the government is now working. It contains several rooms decorated with great elegance, and a large triclinium in the best Pompeian style. On the</page><page sequence="17">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 361 walls of this triclinium are a number of figures a little less than life-size, admirably done. One group represents Silenus offering a drink to a man who bends before him and eagerly presses the cup to his lips. On another wall a figure stands before a prone female figure, possibly an Ariadne, but this fresco is damaged. On the third wall a large winged Victory appears, striking a female figure, who tries to avoid her blows, while a third kneels, praying to the goddess to pardon the guilty one; and a fourth, standing behind, urges her on with clashing cymbals. The expression of these figures, the brightness of the colors, and the truth and likeness of their movements, are said to be extraordinary. A rich cornice, containing a beautiful and original design of maskers, runs around this room. (Nation, July 1, 1909, p. 21.) Metrical Inscription.- In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, pp. 555-572, G. ZOTTOLI interprets a metrical graffito discovered by himself at Pompeii, and reading as follows: Aedilem Proculam cunctorum turba probavit : Hoc pudor ingenuus postulat et pietas. The Proculus referred to he identifies with P. Paquius Proculus, unani- mously chosen duumnvir in 74 and 79 A.D., the wealthy baker whose por- trait, with that of his wife, was found in one of the Pompeian houses. Zottoli regards the inscription as accusing Proculus of unnatural vice, whence the ironical feminine form Proculam. ROME. - An Acquisition of the Museo delle Terme. - The museum in the Baths of Diocletian has acquired from Signor Ernesto Magnani a standing statue of Heracles. (Boll. Arte, II, 1908, p. 478.) The Excavations on the Janiculum. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1908, pp. 510-529 (2 plans; 3 figs.), P. GAUCKLER reports upon the excavations carried on under his direction at the site of the Lucus Furrinae on the Janiculum. The predictions which he made in C. R. A cad. Insc. 1907, pp. 134 ff., based upon a study of inscriptions found on the villa Sciarra in 1906 (A.J.A. XT, p. 359), have all been fulfilled. At the bottom of a well were found three grottoes, from which came the water of the spring used in connection with the sanctuaries. This spring has now been restored to its former channel. The basin into which it originally fell was found in 1902, and is now in a private collection in Rome. The sanctuary of the Syrian gods, to which the spring belonged in later times, has been found, and in it the torso of a seated male divinity, perhaps the Syrian Baal. At the east end of the temple is an altar, under which was a box-like cavity containing the upper part of a skull. This may point to a human sacri- fice of consecration such as is known in various oriental cults. Further details are given by R. LANCIANI in Athen. March 13, 1909, pp. 324-325. The original sanctuary, built by Gaionas in 176 A.D., was abandoned 150 years later and another built at a higher level. This was carelessly con- structed without foundations. It comprises a central assembly-room facing east and west, with a triangular altar in the middle, and a square one in the apse at the east end, under which the skull mentioned above was found. The assembly-room is surrounded by five or six chapels, in the plan of which the triangular shape prevails. Two feet beneath the floor of the temple two statues were discovered, one a young Bacchus absolutely perfect, with</page><page sequence="18">362 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 head and hands heavily gilded; the other a young Isis of black basalt, per- haps an Egyptian work. These were probably hidden by the worshippers after the decree for the suppression of such societies in 377. In the core of the triangular altar was found a lion-headed Mithra with serpents coiled about it, but so stained by the five eggs buried with it that the material of which it was made has not yet been ascertained. (Cf. Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 77-78.) In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1909, pp. 125-127 (plan), M. DIEULAFOY argues that the two temples really belong together and supplement each other. The western temple corresponds to the izechnB khank, or house of prayer of the Persians; and the eastern to the ayadana, devoted to the cult of the sacred fire. The eastern temple is very similar in plan to one exca- vated at Susa. Excavations along the Via Portuensis. - Railway excavations along the line of the Via Portuensis have brought to light many epitaphs in columbaria and other tombs. The ancient cemetery between the Via Pinciana and the Via Salaria also continues to yield quantities of sepulchral inscrip- tions. (G. GATTI, B. Com. Rornm. XXXVI, 1908, pp. 98-101; pl.; fig.) The Via Collatina. - A bit of the Via Collatina was uncovered in the vicolo Malabarba. There was also found a marble sarcophagus containing the skeleton of a woman, protected by a casing of tiles with stamps of the year 143 A.D. (Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, p. 575.) The Via Flaminia. - A bit of the ancient Via Flaminia has been brought to light at the corner of the Victor Emanuel mnonument nearest the Piazza Venezia. Near by were constructions in tufa and in brick. (Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, p. 574.) Sculptural Fragments. - Excavations by the Villa Spithaver uncovered, in a cavity made apparently to conceal them (perhaps not in ancient times), two marble fragments of good design and execution. The first represents a Silenus, lacking the legs; the other is the lower part of a slab carved on both sides, depicting two dancing fauns, and the wreathed heads of a Maenad and a Silenus. (Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 347 ff.; 3 figs.) Other fragments from the same region are pictured and described, ibid. pp. 382 ff. About 4 km. from the city, on the Via Praenestina, two reliefs from a circular monument were found, showing two female figures in full flowing drapery, one standing, the other in rapid motion to the right (ibid. pp. 353 ff. ; 2 figs.). A life- size marble head of a bearded man was found on the Via Aurelia, between the Via Aurelia antica and the Via delle Fornaci. (Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, p. 580.) A Republican Inscription. - A very valable republican inscription has lately been secured for the Conservatori museum (Fig. 1). It is published by G. (GATTI in B. Comrn. Rom. XXXVI, 1908, pp. 169-226 (3 figs. and a plate in the full size of the original). Discovered some time ago, - the exact provenance does not appear, - it has at last attracted due notice. The bronze plate, 0.29 m. high, 0.51-0.52 wide, has suffered chiefly at the upper right-hand corner. Cn. Pomrnpeius Strabo, father of the triumvir, records the gift of citizenship, under the recently enacted Lex Julia, to a turma of auxiliary cavalry from Spain which had served under him in the Social War; also of certain dona militaria to the same troop. In spite of the lacuna above mentioned, the document preserves the names of some forty-five officers who composed the concilium and approved the grants. The date is</page><page sequence="19">ITALY] ARCHA4EOLOGICAL NETVS, 1909 363 90 n.c., or early in 89. GATTI'S edition is supplemented by L. CESANO'S essay on the coins minted by the Italian allies during this war (ibid. pp. 227-240; 6 figs.). Funerary Inscriptions. - At Prati Fiscali were found terra-cotta orna- ments with Egyptian scenes, and a number of funerary inscriptions, one of FIGURE 1. - INSCRIPTION OF REPUBLICAN TIMES. which, a metrical inscription in Greek, was dedicated by her husband to a midwife named Julia Primigenia,who, after saving the lives of many women, could not herself escape death. (Rend. A cc. Lincei, XVII, 1908, p. 575.) Recent Finds of Coins.- Besides the hoard of republican bronzes found at Ostia, a number of important imperial coins, from Rome and else- where, are minutely described by Fr. GNECCHI in R. Ital. Num. XXII, 1909, pp. 19-26 (pl.). SASSARI. - Acquisitions of the Museum. - The museum of antiqui- ties at Sassari, Sardinia, has recently received by gift a number of inscrip- tions, fragments of vases of the Carthaginian and Roman periods, objects of bronze, etc. (Boll. A rte, II, 1908, p. 479.) SICILY.-- Prehistoric Tombs at Gela. - In B. Pal. It. IV, 1908, pp. 155-168 (fig.), P. Onsr continues his description of the prehistoric tombs of Gela, with an estimate of the results of the excavations. SGURGOLA. - A New Brick-stamp. - A new brick-stamp of early date (as shown by the form SERVOS) has been found at Sgurgola (near Anagni), and added to the collection in the Antiquarium on the Caelian. (G. GATTI, B. Comn. Romn. XXXVI, 1908, pp. 48-52; fig.) TEANO. - Baths. - A great thermal establishment has been excavated at Teanuml Sidicinum, and is described at length, with plans and views, by E. GAsBRICI in Not. Sca,. 1908, pp. 399-416 (13 figs.). VICENZA. - Necropolis. - Near the church of S. Felice excavations have brought to light some Christian and some pagan tombs. In one of the latter the undisturbed skeleton had a small bronze coin lying by its left</page><page sequence="20">364 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 hand. Cremated and inhumated bodies lay in the same necropolis, which perhaps dates from the third century of the Christian era. (Not. Scav. 1908, pp. 337 ff.) SPAIN NUMANTIA. - The Excavations of 1908.- The fourth campaign of excavation (1908) completes twelve months of actual work, one-quarter of which has been given to the Iberian city, the rest to the Roman works. Many features of the latter are only now fully understood. On the hill El Castillejo, the most important site in the line of circumvallation, three super- imposed legionary camps are distinguished. The latest is that of Scipio, 134-133 B.c., probably his own headquarters; the second, which is very solidly built of sandstone and contains a cistern-room with channelled floor, probably belongs to Marcellus, 152-151; and a third, of which the cavalry quarters remain, is perhaps that of Pompey, 141-139. Scipio's own prae- toriumrn has the form of a Greek peristyle house, which he perhaps intro- duced into Roman military usage. In these and the other fortified camps many points of arrangement are of interest for comparison with the German limes castella and to illustrate written descriptions. The small finds, such as coins, weapons, and pottery, are of value for their exact dating. The very late discovery of another large, fortified camp at the village of Renieblas, six km. from the city, renders a fifth campaign necessary. A new map of the whole district has been made by a German expert. (A. SCHULTEN, Arch. Anz. 1908, cols. 477-498; 8 figs.) FRANCE PRE-ROMAN REMAINS IN FRANCE. -In R. ?t. Anc. XI, 1909, pp. 53-68, M. CLERC publishes notes on several pre-Roman sites in France. Near Cavaillon the hill called " Mont Saint-Jacques" is the site of a pre- Roman town. Numerous fragments of pottery are to be found in the vicinity. At Riez the pre-Roman town is to be sought near the hill Saint- Maximne, while the Roman town lay near the four columns which still stand with their architrave. These columns probably formed part of a temple, but it is not known to what deity it was dedicated. At Les Pennes- Mirabeau there is the site of a pre-Roman town known locally as "Collet Redon" or " La Tote Noire." The site is about 50 m. by 20 m. and difficult of access. Unauthorized excavations have been carried on here, but little is known of the results. Corn found in one vessel shows the character of the place. Fragments of native hand-made pottery are abundant; and many pieces of Greek vases have been picked up. They are Ionic of the seventh century B.C., and Attic of the fifth and fourth centuries, though some of the latter may be Campanian. iNo Roman pottery has been found. The town was probably not inhabited after the second century B.C. A Latin inscription at Moustiers-Sainte-Marie is also published. AIX.- New Inscriptions. - In R. Et. Anc. XI, 1909, pp. 49-52 (fig.), M. CLERC publishes three fragmentary Latin inscriptions found in the vicinity of Aix, and a terra-cotta plaque, 16 cm. long by 8 cm. wide, divided into squares by lines. In each square is a Greek letter. The writer makes no attempt at decipherment, but is inclined to believe that it is a magic tablet. It is now in the museum at Aix.</page><page sequence="21">FRANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 365 FR.JUS. -A Mosaic. - A fine mosaic has been discovered at Frdjus, representing a cock-fight, together with other animals. (Riom.-Germ. Kor- respondenzblatt, II, 1909, p. 10.) LA CHAPELLE.- Three Tumuli. - In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 216- 232, M. PIROUTET and J. DICHELETTE describe three small tumuli at the western foot of Mont Poupet, near the hamlet of Onay in the commune of La Chapelle. The three are nearly contemporaneous, and their contents are characteristic of the second Age of Bronze, according to the classification of Montelius. A description and classification of the tombs of the Bronze Age in Franche-Comt4 is added. MONTAGNAC. - The Lower Part of a Municipal Statue.- In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1908, pp. 218-219, A. HiRON DE VILLEFOSSE calls atten- tion to the lower part of a Roman statue found at Montagnac. It repre- sented a man, clad in the toga, standing with left foot advanced; but it is broken off at the knees. At the left of the figure is a capsa. The statue belongs to the so-called municipal type, which is common in Africa but has rarely been found in Gaul. MONT GU]lRIN.- Excavations.- In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 39-45, MAURICE PIROUTET describes a week's excavations in the camp at Mont Guirin (Jura), in the commune of Montmirey-la-Ville. There was at this place a settlement at the end of the neolithic or the beginning of the Bronze Age, but the most numerous relics (bronzes, vases, terra-cottas, etc.) belong to the beginning of the Hallstatt III period. Three fragments of Greek amphorae confirm the existence of commercial relations with the Mediter- ranean regions. PARIS. - Acquisitions of the Louvre.- Among the recent acquisi- tions of the Louvre are: (1) A female head of marble of the first half of the fifth century, perhaps in the style of Calamis, formerly in the Borghese palace (J.H.S. XIV, 1894, pp. 198-205; Gaz. B.-A. 1909, pp. 52-64.). (2) A bearded male head from Macedonia. (3) A funeral stele from Laurium, inscribed ACeoKpc?ty 'Orpvvcv . (4) A bronze statuette representing a reclining goat, of good style, from Cephisia. (5) A bronze dicast's ticket from Athens, in- scribed EiprtVoKXE'lt 'Ai&amp;va[Zos], published in B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1908, pp. 352- 360 (fig.). (6) A bronze statuette of Zeus with wreath on head, standing, partially draped. His extended right hand holds an eagle; his left leans on a sceptre. (7) A small bronze head of Dionysus crowned with ivy, from Syria. His long hair falls down upon his shoulders, and two small horns appear above the forehead. (8) A mosaic from Carthage, representing a nude winged Eros, holding a basket full of black grapes. (A. HERON DE VILLEFOSSE and E. MICHON, B. Soc. A nt. Fr. 1908, pp. 368-375; 2 figs.) ROQUEFEUIL. - A Head of Silvanus.- In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1908, pp. 226-227, A. HARON DE VILLEFOSSE reports the discovery at Roque- feuil, between Trets and Pourribres, of a marble head of Silvanus. It is 28 cm. high, of rather good workmanship, and represents the god bearded and wearing a crown of pine twigs. The marble has become yellow through age. SALINS. - Greek Vases in a Hallstatt Oppidum. - In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 193-212 (pl.; 6 figs.), M. PIROUTET and J. DECHELETTE describe the oppidum called " Camp du Chateau," in the commune of Salins (Jura). Five strata are distinguished and the objects found in them de-</page><page sequence="22">366 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 scribed. Tombs were also found in the neighborhood. Fragments of black-figured and red-figured Greek vases, which must be dated in the sixth or the early part of the fifth century B.c., were found in the oppidum in con- junction with bronzes, etc., of the Hallstatt III period, thus confirming the chronology arrived at from other data. Similar discoveries elsewhere are noted. The cornmmercial relations of the south with Gaul were evidently im- portant in the sixth century m.c. GERMANY NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENTS IN GERMANY. - In R6m.-Germ. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 17-23, A. SCHLIZ describes neolithic settle- ments at Obereisesheimn, Nekarsulm, and other places with stone implements and pottery (see A.J.A.XIII, p. 98). BADEN-BADEN. - Latin Inscriptions. - In Rum.-Germ. Korrespon- denzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 23-24, F. HAUG publishes two sepulchral inscriptions of the first century, marking the graves of soldiers. BERLIN. - Prehistoric Stone Vessels from Egypt. - In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 220-226 (10 figs.), H. RANKE gives a brief account of some FIGURE 2. - FRAGMENT OF A STONPE VASE. remarkable, prehistoric stone vessels re- cently acquired by the Berlin museum. They were found at Abusir-el-meleq, east of the Fayum, in 1905 and 1906, when about 1200 graves were opened. They are often in the shape of animals, and in other respects imitate vessels of clay. One reproduces a basket. Stone vases found in royal tombs of the first dynasty are far inferior to those of the prehistoric period. The writer also publishes an interesting fragment of a stone vase from a prehistoric necropolis in Upper Egypt upon which appears in relief an Egyptian warrior with raised axe, driving an enemy before him (Fig. 2). Nothing like this has previously been found in Egypt. An Egyptian Sketchbook. - In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 197-203 (7 figs.), A. ERMAN publishes part of an Egyptian sketchbook recently acquired by the Ber- lin museum from Upper Egypt. The papyrus, which is broken into three pieces, is divided into small squares by red lines and the figures sketched in red or gray and then finished in black. Among the drawings are a hawk-headed lion, a swallow, a rooster, a seated king, etc. The book belongs to a late, i.e. Greek period, and three hands may be recognized in it. It was probably the property of some shop where the drawings served as models for painters and sculptors. An Old Persian Bronze. - In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 164-166</page><page sequence="23">GERMANY] ARCIHAEOLOGICAL NEWVS, 1909 367 (fig.), L. MESSERSCHMIDT publishes a small Persian bronze in the Berlin museum representing tlhe fore part of a reclining bull. Its resemblance to the bull capitals of Persepolis is striking. Examples of ancient Persian art are not numerous. This was probably attached to some piece of furniture as a foot. A Phoenician Ornamental Axe.- In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 97- 99 (fig.), L. MESSERSCHMIDT publishes a Phoenician axe in the Berlin mu- seum (Fig. 3). It is shaped like a half' ellipse with the usual hole for the haft and with two large holes in the blade. Ornamental lines run around the top of these holes, then join and extend in a straight line to the cttting edge, dividing the blade in two. On the hammer end are two small lions in the round facing each other over a victim. Such an axe is not practical and must have been made for purposes of decoration. The lion motive points to Syria as the place of its manu- facture. A Clazomenian Sarcophagus.-- A terra-cotta sarcophagus of the usual tapering shape, now in the Royal Museums at Berlin, is described by R. ZAHN in Jb. A rch. LI XXIII, 1908, pp. 169-180 (3 figs.), and compared in all its details of decoration with other contemporary specimens already pub- FIGURE 3. - PHOENICIAN AXE. lished. The peculiarity of the new one is in its having the light-on-dark technique for the decoration of the upper part and the dark-on-light for the lower part. The main picture shows a winged Athena between two dis- mnounted horsemen who may be meant for the Dioscuri. Two centaurs are of the very old Silenus type with full human figure joined to the hind part of a horse. A Campanian Crater.-- In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 185-189 (fig.), R. ZAHN publishes a fine Campanian crater 0.57 mn. high recently ac- quired by the Antiquariumn in Berlin. It is black, with gilding about the lip, and adorned about the middle with a garland of vine leaves represented plastically and then gilded. The gilding on the black background produces the effect of a metal vase. It dates from the second half of the fourth cen- tury B.c. A Portrait Head of MIaximin.--In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 137- 141 (fig.), H. WTINNEFELD publishes a portrait head of the Roman emperor Maximin (235-238 A.D.) recently acquired by the Berlin museum. It is identified by coins and by a portrait head in Munich. Traces of paint are still to be seen on the eyes, hair, and beard. Prehistoric Bronze Weapons from Canena.-- In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 179-182 (2 figs.), H. SCHMIDT publishes two bronze weapons found a number of years ago at Canena, near Halle a. S., and lately acquired by the Berlin museum. One is a dagger of a type found in northern Italy</page><page sequence="24">868 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 where it was probably made and exported to northern Europe. The other is a peculiar weapon consisting of a dagger attached at right angles to a handle of bronze (Fig. 4). The type probably originated in Spain. Both weapons belong to the oldest bronze period of FIGURE 4. - BRONZE WEAPON. niorthern Europe and therefore date from the begin- ning of the second millennium B.C. They are de- scribed also in Z. Ethn. XLI, 1909, pp. 125-127. Objects of the La Thne Period from Hra- discht.-In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 177-199 (3 figs.), SCHUCHHARDT publishes a number of objects from the collection of W. Osborne recently acquired by the Berlin museum. They all came from Hradischt in Bohemia and belong to the La Thne period of culture, dating from the first cen- tury B.C. They consist of iron tools, bronze fibulae and other ornaments, horn pins, and a black glazed, or light red and white painted pottery. BONN. - A Roman Portrait Head. - In Bonn. Jb. 118, 1909, pp. 121-138 (2 pls.; 7 figs.), H. LEHNER publishes a portrait head of a Roman lady found two years ago at Schwarzrheindorf and now in the museum at Bonn. It is life-size, of Parian marble, and probably dates from 200-240 A.D. Excavations carried on at the place where the head was found have revealed a few traces of the prehistoric period, but nothing of Roman date. The head, therefore, probably came from Bonn and may have been the portrait of a Roman empress. A Terra-cotta Portrait of a German. - In Bonn. Jb. 118, 1909, pp. 63- 74 (pl.; 4 figs.), A. voN SALIS publishes a small terra-cotta portrait of a man, now in the museum at Bonn, which still retains most of its original color. It dates from the first century A.D., and the mode in which the hair is dressed shows that it represents a German. GIESSEN.-Neolithic Settlements. - In the spring of 1908 a neo- lithic settlement was discovered near Leihgestern, 7 km. south of Giessen. Stone axes and other tools and quantities of potsherds, both decorated and undecorated, were found at a depth of from 0.50 m. to 1.20 m. below the sur- face. At another neolithic settlement already known 1 km. east of Giessen two tombs of the La Thne period were opened and in one of them a sword 88 cm. long was found together with an iron armlet, a bronze neck ring, etc. (KRAMER, Rum.-Germ. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 33-36; 3 figs.) GORNHAUSEN. - A Glass Urn. - Fragments of clear yellowish green glass were found at Gornhausen, which when put together made a nearly complete urn, about 30 cm. high. (R6m.-Germ.

KROPATSCHECK describes two Roman amu- lets found before the north door of Nida, the Roman settlement at Hed- dernheim. One was a crescent-shaped pendant of silver, like the lunula of Plautus, Epid. 640. The other was a bronze phallus, inscribed with the word</page><page sequence="25">GERMANY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 369 puro, which Kropatscheck takes as equivalent to puero, comparing Varro, L.L.

JENA. - Acquisition of Late Roman Antiquities. - First publica- tion in full of antiquities found in a late Roman tomb at Dienstedt near Remda by G. EICHHORN in Z. Ethn. XL, 1908, pp. 902-914, describes fully, with illustrations, a peculiar neck-ring of silver wire, two thick rosette-like fibulae of conical shape, a cross-bow fibula, an amber necklace, bracelets of silver wire, a bronze pail with loose handle, a flat bowl of bronze, with three ring-handles, a bone needle, an iron knife with bone handle, and a number of small ornaments or bosses of silver or silver wire. The find, which re- mained for a time in the library in Weimar, is now in the museum of the University of Jena. The grave was of late provincial Roman times, the workmanship of the silver dating somewhere between 200 and 350 A.D. MAINZ.- Latin Inscriptions. - In Rbm.-Germ. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 37-39, Kdrber publishes eight fragmentary Latin inscriptions recently found at Mainz. A considerable portion of the inscription, of which part was published ibid. I, p. 76, No. 4, was recovered in small pieces. NEU STRELITZ. - Report of Progress in the Rethra-Explora- tion. - In Z. Ethn. XL, 1908, pp. 915-919, G. OESTEN tells of remains found beneath the waters of Blankenburgsteich: oak pillars, grooved or mortised and fastened with wooden pins, and a plank flooring covered with a mosaic of small stones. These a committee of the Anthropological Society of Berlin agree with the finder in regarding as relics of the stone age. In Zippelower and Rosenholz Oesten has found remains of military walls and gates, which he regards as tile Pagus Riederierumn of Thietmar and his urbs quaedam Riedegost. The Fischerinsel has been more fully investi- gated, including the structure near the shore, where charred wood, masses of burnt clay, stones split by the action of fire, parts of the skeleton of a horse, an iron buckle, pieces of sheet metal, etc., were found. The sub- structure of the island, formed of brush-wood and timbers, is described. NYM1WEGEN.- A Roman Vase with Reliefs. -In the Rom.-Germ. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 8-9, G. MESTWERDT describes a Roman vase with three medallions in relief which was found at Nymwegen. One of the medallions represents a quadriga, with the inscription calos venete, "well done, blue," calos being for KaLX&amp;s. Medallions on each side of this show a running dog and a leaping stag. OBERADEN. --Excavation of the Roman Camp. -In the Rmn.- Germ. Korrespondenzblatt, II, 1909, pp. 1-8, G. KROPATSCHECK describes the excavation of the Roman camp at Oberaden (see A.J.A. XII, pp. 372, 478). The remains of pottery showed that the camp occupied the site of a German settlement, and these, with the coins which were unearthed, show that the camp was an early one of Drusus, not mentioned in our literary sources, and contemporary with the earliest remains at Haltern. The camp was shown to be octagonal in shape, and two more towers were located, as well as the praetorium. OSNABRQCK. - Acquisition of Roman Coins. - A number of Ro- man coins were recently found at Barenau, including a very rare gold coin of 16 B.c. They were taken to the museum at Osnabriick.

GOTZE describes two hill-graves (Hiigelgrdber) near Poserna (Weissen- fels). A round or oval pit is carried deeper by digging a rectangular hole in the bottom of it, a board or plank perhaps originally covering this lower part. Flint implements, spiral ornaments (earrings?), amphorae of two sorts (Schnuramphorae and Kugelamphorae), a stone-axe, flint-chippings, and fragments of skeletons were found in these graves, which the writer refers to the Middle-German stone age. ZABERN. - A Gallo-Roman Neoropolis. - In breaking through a Roman wall to construct a street, a Gallo-Roman burial place was found with various small objects, coins, fibulae, etc. (R6m.-Germ.

GNIRS publishes the more important results of excavations conducted in southern Istria in the spring of 1907. At Val Catena a small temple was found between the two temples already known, and 2.4 m. from the semicircular colonnade. North of this temple there are several rooms with a portico 150 m. long and 10 m. wide leading to a small building. Part of the entablature of the temple of Neptune was found. At Monte Collisi a small villa rustica in which oil was made came to light, and a number of short inscriptions, chiefly names stamped on tiles. At Pola a number of sepulchral fragments were dis- covered between the Porta Aurea and the Porta Ercole. Repairs to the Palazzo Municipale show that a considerable portion of the west wall of the temple is still well preserved. At the east end of the modern Foro the demolition of some houses revealed exedrae and niches, in one of which were fragments of a statue of a Roman emperor, perhaps Trajan, and a kneeling barbarian. GORDUN.- A Prehistoric Vase.--In Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology, II, 1909, pp. 27-32 (pl.), A M. WTOODWARD publishes a prehistoric vase found in 1906 at Gordun, eighteen miles inland from Spalato. It is hand-made, and decorated with two bands of hatched tri- angles incised and filled in with white. The surface is burnished to a lustrous black. It probably dates from the end of the neolithic period. GREAT BRITAIN BARTON MVOATS. - A Late Celtic Settlement. - In Cl. R. XXII, 1908, pp. 259-260 (pl.), F. G. WALKER describes a late Celtic settlement recently found at Barton Moats near Cambridge. In digging trial trenches through a large mound a ditch 110 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 5 feet deep was discovered almost full of black ash. This was composed of a mixture of burnt straw, seeds, bones of animals, potsherds, bronze and iron articles, some of which are Roman, including a horse-shoe, and other things. An earthen cooking pot still standing on its hearth of stones with burnt twigs under it was the most noteworthy single find. The trench was inhabited from about 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. by people living in wattle huts. BRANSTON HALL.- Bronze Celts.-In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII,</page><page sequence="27">GREAT BRITAIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 371 1908, pp. 3-5, there is a description by Sir JOHN EVANS of ten bronze celts from Branston Hall, four miles southeast of Lincoln. They were found in a gravel pit about two feet from the surface and are in an excellent state of preservation. Four of them are from the same mould. BRASSINGTON.- Exploration of the Harborough Rocks Cave. - In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII, 1908, pp. 9-12, W. BEMIROSE makes a brief re- port upon the exploration of the Harborough Rocks Cave about one mile from Brassington. The floor is uneven, with several deep pockets at the far end and one near the entrance. At the back the soil was about three feet deep and showed three floors. The finds consisted of pottery dating from Roman times and later, five brooches, several knives and small objects in bone and metal and a rudely cut gem probably representing Athena, armed with shield and spear, holding a Victory. Many bones of animals were also found. Ibid. pp. 129-135 (2 plans), W. S. Fox describes in detail the excavation of the cave. R. A. SMITH, ibid. pp. 135-145 (pl.; 2 figs.), discusses the objects found and concludes that the cave was used in the first and second centuries A.D., and perhaps two or three hundred years earlier, by people who were in touch with the pre-Roman civilization of Yorkshire. CORBRIDGE. - The Excavations of 1907. -In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXIIT, 1908, pp. 300-302, F. HAVERFIELD summarizes the results of the excavations at Corbridge in 1907. The approach to the north end of the Roman bridge over the Tyne was uncovered; an extensive building provided with hypo- causts, and probably a residence, was excavated on the top of a hill ; near this, but of earlier date, was found a tank in which was a remarkable Ro- mano-British relief representing a lion; and finally, on the hill-top, on both sides of a street, many buildings were excavated which yielded some in- scriptions and many miscellaneous antiquities. CORSTOPITUM. -The Excavations of 1908.--In Cl. R. XXIII, 1909, pp. 26-28, R. H. FORSTER reports upon the excavations at Corstopitumrn in 1908. On the north side of the broad street discovered in 1907, remains of two granaries were found nearly one hundred feet long from north to south and more than twenty -feet wide. In the east granary several frag- ments of sculpture came to light, including a panel bearing a head with rays and a circular nimbus. Behind the left shoulder is a scourge. Some dis- tance east of the granaries are the remains of a large building which was only partially excavated. On its west side, which is over 220 feet long, the wall still stands, in places to a height of four courses, built of large stones. From the inner face cross walls project eastward at intervals of about eigh- teen feet, forming a series of small courts which probably opened upon a large central court. West of the northern part of this structure was a small, rude building of late date in which forty-eight gold coins and a large gold ring were found wrapped in a piece of sheet lead. The coins, which are in fine condition, date from Valentinian I to Magnus Maximus, and were probably hidden about 385 A.D. Over one thousand coins in all have been found on the site, many of them showing traces of fire. Great quantities of pottery and many small bronzes were also found.

XXII, 1908, pp. 164-207 (6 plans; 12 pls.; 7 figs.), a report is made upon the ex- ploration of the Red Hills during the years 1906 and 1907. H. WILMER points out that there are several hundred of these on the coast of Essex varying in size from a few rods to several acres, most of them under culti- vation. They are low mounds, a few feet above the level of the surround- ing marshes, composed of a mass of burnt earth and containing many roughly shaped pieces of burnt clay, some of which are a foot in length and from half an inch to an inch in thickness. The use to which they were put is at present unknown. Three mounds were opened at Langenhoe, and one at Goldhanger. The absence of domestic utensils proves that the mounds were not occupied. W. H. DALTON discusses the geological aspects of these mounds; J. H. B. JENKINS, the chemical character of some of the finds; E. T. NEWTON, the bones; A. H. LYELL, the plants identified in the charcoal; and F. W. READER, the pottery fragments. Ibid. pp. 207-214 (3 figs.), some late Celtic remains from the coast of Brittany resembling objects found in the Red Hills are published. The purpose of these mounds is not yet clear. GODMANCHESTER. - Discovery of Greek Coins. - Two Greek coins, of the first and second centuries B.C., together with nine Roman coins, ranging in period from Domitian to Constantine II, were found in a small ancient burial-place in Godmanchester by F. G. WALKER, who records the discovery in Num. Chron. 1908, pp. 374-375 (2 figs.). LANSDOWN. -Recent Discoveries.- In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII, 1908, pp. 34-38 (5 pls.), T. S. BusH reports upon the excavations at Lans- down, near Bath, 1905-08. Foundations of six buildings were brought to light, and many small objects of bronze and iron, as well as quantities of pottery. One rude British coin was found and 234 Roman coins, dating from the time of Antoninus Pius to the fifth century. There were also found four stone coffins containing skeletons, a number of human skulls and other bones, several flat disks of o6lite, and a number of stone moulds. MAUMBURY RINGS. - A Roman Amphitheatre.- H. S. GRAY reports that the excavations begun at Maumbury Rings prove that the place was a Roman amphitheatre. The hard chalk floor was covered with a gravelly substance, perhaps used for the surface of the arena. Roman pottery and other remains were found at this level. As yet no trace of steps for the accommodation of the spectators has been discovered. (E. J. FORSDYKE, Cl. R. XXIII, 1909, p. 60.) OXFORD. - Acquisitions of the Ashmolean Museum in 1908. In the Report of the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum for 1908, the following acquisitions are announced: (1) Several specimens of Egyptian blue-glazed pottery of the eighteenth dynasty, representing "wasters" from a factory, spoiled by overheating. (2) A Mycenaean onos from Rhodes. (3) Bronze pins and fibulae, of the early Iron Age, from a tomb at Aegion. (4) A Tanagra figurine, representing an old woman bent with age. The features are taken from life. (5) A draped female figure in relief, holding a cornu- copia, from a pale blue enamelled vase of Ptolemaic fabric.

One from Cologne is inscribed bene bibe. An interesting class con- sists of glazed, red-faced vessels, with incised plant designs. (7) Several imnplements of the Bronze Age, from Long Wittenham and from the Thames, near Wallingford. PEVENSEY. - Excavations at the Roman Fort.- Excavations at the Roman fort at Pevensey, Sussex, have revealed a drain running through the north wall, and a well 4 feet square and 10 feet 6 inches deep, of Roman date. The coins and potsherds found belong to the fourth or third century A.D. (L. W. SALZMANN, Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII, 1908, pp. 151-153.) RUTLAND.- Miscellaneous Discoveries. - In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII, 1908, pp. 46-56 (2 pls.; fig.), V. B. CROWTHER-BEYNON reports upon the discoveries in Rutland since 1903. There have been found at Oakham a number of worked flints and scrapers, and at Great Casterton a skeleton of the prehistoric period. At Cottesmore a hoard of objects of the Bronze Age was discovered, including two socketed celts and parts of two others, a socketed spear head, three gouges, a chisel, and part of a sword blade. At Market Overton a Roman pottery kiln was found, together with many broken vessels and miscellaneous small objects. Many Anglo-Saxon remains came to light here, among them a water clock, and objects of mediaeval date were found in various places. SPROUGHTON. - A Bronze Age Dagger Blade.--In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXII, 1908, pp. 86-88 (fig.), C. H. READ publishes a dagger blade, 9? inches long, from Sproughton, Ipswich. It is a fine specimen, dating from the Bronze Age. He also publishes a bronze tore from the Thames. AFRICA CARTHAGE.- Excavations on the Hill of Bordj-Djedid.- The excavations carried on in 1908 on the south side of the hill of Bordj-Djedid, Carthage, have yielded interesting results. At the foot of the hill a semi- circular construction, 40 m. in diameter, was found, corresponding to an aqueduct of similar shape. Back of this were considerable remains of baths, in which fragments of an inscription in honor of the emperors Crispus, Licinius, and Constantine were discovered. Lower down were Carthaginian graves, most of which had been opened in Roman times. The burial cham- ber was at the foot of a shaft, and the bodies were burnt and enclosed in wooden coffins. The objects found in the tombs, small vases, lamps, etc., were of no particular value. In one grave was a silver plate, 4 cm. x 3.2 cm., engraved with figures common in Egyptian art. These tombs in date occupy a middle place between those of Douimes and Sainte-Monique. During the excavations an important deposit of Roman lamps was found, many of them of unusual shape and decoration. (Father DELATTRE, C. R. Acad. Insc. 1908, pp. 592-601; 5 figs.) Lead Seals. - In B.

Two of them consist of a single disk of lead, with a hole running through it transversely. The other consists of two disks soldered together, with the string between them. Other lead seals from Carthage are published by the same author, ibid. pp. 242, 288, 299, 306-307, and 363-365; and still</page><page sequence="30">374 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

MAHDIA. - Recovery of Objects from the Sea. - The latest efforts to recover the objects discovered by sponge divers in the sea near Mahdia (A.J.A. XIIl, pp. 102-103) are reported upon by A. MERLIN in C. R. Acad. Insc. 1908, pp. 532-541 (fig.). There are about sixty Ionic and Corinthian columns, about 5 m. high and 0.70 m. in diameter, carefully piled in ten rows just as they were aboard ship. Capitals and other blocks were placed between them. None of the columns have been brought to the surface as yet. Pieces of the ship were found, some minor objects of bronze, and many broken amphorae; also parts of at least three large marble vases adorned with figures carved in relief, similar to the so-called Borghese vase in the Louvre. The ship was about 30 m. long and 7 or 8 m. wide, and no doubt sank from overloading. TUNIS. - New Latin Inscriptions. --In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1909, pp. 91-101 (fig.), A. MERLIN publishes four Latin inscriptions recently found in Tunis. At Medeina, the ancient Althiburos, the forum measuring 37 m. by 45 m. was surrounded by a colonnade. Within this stood statues, most of the bases of which are preserved. One here published records the setting up of a Marsyas. Two inscriptions found between Kasrin (Cillium) and Feriana (Thelepte) prove that the tribe Musuni mentioned by Pliny lived in that region; and that the abbreviation Gens Mus. Reg. stands for gens Mus(uniorum) Reg(ianorum). Another found at Siaoun in the extreme south of Tunis shows that in 198 A.D. a fortified camp was established at that spot by Septimius Severus as a protection against the Garamantes. UNITED STATES BOSTON. -Recent Acquisitions by the Museum of Fine Arts.- The Thirty-third Annual Report of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts an- nounces the following acquisitions: (1) Six fragments of an archaic grave stele of a youth from Boeotia. The three larger fragments contain (a) the head and left fore-arm; (b) the waist and the legs to the knees ; (c) the right hand. "Representation in flat relief of a nude youth in profile to right, his left leg forward. His right hand, slightly advanced and raised, holds an aryballos by a strap; his left hand is raised to the level of his head and holds up a branch with two pomegranates. On his head is an olive wreath; below this the hair is arranged in four spiral curls. The nose and chin are injured. On the aryballos are traces of decoration in relief,--a tongue pattern on the shoulder, and a lotos chain." Above the head are two let- ters of an inscription. (2) A torso of a man, 0.20 m. high, of Graeco- Roman style. (3) Four bronze statuettes, one of Graeco-Roman date representing Nike advancing, with floating drapery. In her raised right hand she carries a wreath, in her left a cornucopia. (4) An Etruscan mir- ror similar to that in Gerhard, Etr. Spiegel, I, Pl. LXXXIII. (5) Seven Greek vases including the fine hydria published by J. C. Hoppin (Harvard Stuaies in Classical Philology, XII, pp. 335 ff.). (6) Ten Lower Italian and Etruscan vases. (7) Thirty-one coins, of which three are gold and the rest silver. (8) A number of miscellaneous objects of terra-cotta, glass, and stucco.</page><page sequence="31">UNITED STATES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWVS, 1909 375 NEW YORK. - Acquisitions of the Metropolitan Museum. - The acquisitions of the Metropolitan Museum in 1908 consist of ten marbles, seventeen bronzes, fifteen vases, nine statuettes and other objects of terra- cotta and seven objects of gold and silver. The most important sculptures are a fragment of a fighting Gaul of the Pergamene school; two Greek grave stelae of the best period; a small broken figure, 39 cm. high, perhaps Zeus, probably from a pediment (Fig. 5) ; a small head of a youth of the fourth century from Tarentum; a replica of the head and shoulders of the "Dresden Satyr"; a small bearded head; a head of Augustus; and two other Roman portrait heads, one of the republican period and the other of the second century A.D. The bronzes include two fine Greek statuettes of the middle of the fifth century B.c.; three archaic Greek statuettes; a larger FIGURE .--FRAXGMENT OF SCULPTURE (ZEUS ?). statuette of Hermes, and various utensils. The finest of the vases is a large crater of about 460 B.c., still intact. Four well preserved white lecythi and three exceptionally fine moulds for Arretine vases were also acquired. The objects of precious metal include a large scyphus, two cylices, a jug and a wine ladle, all of silver; and a very beautiful gold earring of fifth century workmanship representing a siren with her head surmounted with a large floral ornament playing upon a lyre. (E. R., B. Metr. Mus. IV, 1909, pp. 44- 45; also G. M. A. R. ibid. pp. 62-65; 6 figs.) The bronzes are described by E. R. ibid. pp. 77-81 (6 figs.). They consist of a statuette of a youth 29.8 cm. high of the transition period (published in the catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club exhibition, P1. LIII) ; a statuette 14.8 cm. high of an athlete, perhaps a jumper (published ibid. p. 46); three small statuettes of the first half of the sixth century, one of which came from Andritzena and represents a peasant (published in Ath. Mitt. 1905, pp. 65 ff.); a Hermes of the Graeco- Roman period; two helmets, one Greek, the other perhaps Gallic; an archaic</page><page sequence="32">376 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 ladle of beautiful design; a candelabrum; a Greek cylix of the fourth century; two attachments for a pail of the sixth century; the handle of a jug with the head of Heracles; the hoof of a horse from a Roman equestrian statue; and an overornate chair leg of imperial date. Among the fifteen Greek vases acquired there are seven white lecythi, two of which are black- figured; a large crater decorated above with scenes from the lower world, and below with the punishment of Tityus by Apollo and Artemis, and a combat between Zeus and Hermes and a satyr; a red-figured peleke in the style of Midias; an olpe with the representation of a man worshipping a statue of Athena; and an oenochoe with the return of Hephaestus (G. M. A. R., B. Metr. Mus. IV, 1909, pp. 101-105; 8 figs.). The Cesnola collection of antiquities from Cyprus is to be rearranged and catalogued by J. L. Myres (ibid. pp. 95-96; fig.). EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, MEDIAEVAL, AND RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS EGYPT.- LUXOR. -The Prayer for the Dead in Christian Nubia. - SEYMOUR DE RICCI in C. R. Acad. Insc. 1909, pp. 144-165, communicates to the Academy a series of letters, in one of which he announces the acqui- sition of a Nubian epitaph, in Greek, dating 1181 A.D., and containing the prayer for the dead in use in the Nubian church, and practically identical with that of the modern Greek church. This is the seventh of these epi- taphs with the prayer which have been discovered. The writer gives the comparative text of all seven and expresses the opinion that none of the in- scriptions are earlier than 960, in spite of the early dates hitherto given them. The latest in date is the one just discovered, which is, moreover, probably the latest Greek inscription hitherto found in Egypt. WAD-EL-HADAD. - Christian Remains. - An interesting discovery of Christian remains has recently been made at Wad-el-Hadad, a few miles north of Sennar, on the Blue Nile. A number of skeletons were found to- gether with pottery consisting chiefly of jars and bowls of dark clay deco- rated with Nubian patterns. On one of the bowls is a Coptic processional cross, which also occurs scratched inside the lips of the jars, where it is asso- ciated with two other Christian emblems, the fish and the palm branch. This pottery, which dates from the seventh or eighth century A.D., has been sent to the museum at Khartum. This is the first time that Christian remains have been found so far south. (Nation, January 14, 1909, p. 48.) MESOPOTAMIA. - RUSAFA. - Description of the City's Ruins. - Rusafa, in the old route from Sura to Palmyra, was visited in 1907-08 by F. Saare, who describes the ruins in Monatshefte f. Kunstwiss. II, 1909, pp. 95- 107. The walls make a trapezoid of about 350 m. x 250 m. in extent, and all the important buildings are within them, save a small church of central plan outside the north gate. This had tunnel vaults over the arms of its cruciform plan, domes over the squares at the corners, and probably a wooden dome over the central square. Each side of the city walls has a portal. The walls have towers at intervals on the exterior, and on the interior an engaged colonnade with archivolts. The basilica dedicated to St. Sergius,</page><page sequence="33">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 377 whose martyrdom here gave the town its later name of Sergiopolis, origi- nally had three wide arches in the nave arcade, which were later divided by the introduction of intermediate columns. The basilica has side entrances in the north aisle, and a windowed apse. There was no mosaic in the apse but a stucco ornament like that found by Strzygowski in the convent of Sohag in Upper Egypt. The martyr's tomb was doubtless in the second church within the walls, a central structure of very peculiar plan (Fig. 6). ~~; 11.7~ 1- b FIGURE 6. -PLAN OF CHURCH AT RUSAFA. The date of these monuments is placed by Saare in 491-501; the recon- structions and the church outside the north gate in the sixth or seventh century. TURKEY. - SALONICA. - Byzantine Mosaics. - The Russian Archaeological Institute has issued a report of its investigations of Byzan- tine churches at Salonica in 1907 and 1908. In the churches of St. De- metrius, St. Sophia, and St. George remains were found which make Salonica second only to Ravenna as a treasury of Byzantine art. Repairs to St. Demetrius enabled Upensky to examine the mosaics (see A. J.A. XIII, p. 105). The patron saint appears about a dozen times in various postures. In one case he is standing in a bell-shaped niche, wearing a white robe bordered with gold and decorated with a large band. Near by are three persons: in the centre St. Demetrius; on the right the Illyrian praefect Leontius; and on the left Bishop Eusebius. Ikons of the Virgin appear in many places resembling the most ancient extant representations, such as that in the church of Kitti, near Larnaca in Cyprus. The church of St. Demetrius was partially destroyed by fire in the seventh century, and most of the new mosaics date from the time of the rebuilding. The character- istic feature of the mosaics is their realism. The scenes are taken from actual life, and are devoid of mystic or symbolical influence. Blue is the prevailing color of the backgrounds; and silver is always used for the nimbus. (Nation, May 27, 1909, pp. 544-545.)</page><page sequence="34">878 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 ITALY NEW WORKS OF ART. - Riv. d' Arte, 1909, pp. 45-54, publishes for the first time three works of art, over the initials of G. POGGI and the name of O. H. GIGLIOLI. The first is a tapestry representing the Last Supper, owned by the Confraternith del Sacramento, in Camaiore, near Viareggio. It belongs to the early sixteenth century. The next is the dossale of an altar in S. Romolo at Bivigliano, with figures of the Madonna and Saints in the main panel and Christ with Saints, in half figure, in the predella. The figures are white on a blue ground. Giglioli assigns the work to Andrea della Robbia and.assistants, and dates it about 1490, a date confirmed by docu- ments which show that the dossale was in the church in 1494. The third work published is a Madonna, by Agostino di Duccio, in the church of S. Francesco at Pontremoli. Ibid. pp. 128-135, are published the following works: a modern St. John Baptist in S. Romolo at Bivigliano; an almost forgotten Annunciation, with a predella, by Fra Angelico, in the church of S. Francesco di Montecarlo in S. Giovanni Valdarno; a Madonna, by Andrea della Robbia, in the church of S. Iacopo a Castro at Firenzuola; and a St. Sebastian, by Baccio da Montelupo, in the abbey of S. Godenzo. WORKS OF ART IN THE ABRUZZI.- A series of notes by P. PICCIRILLI in L'Arte, 1909, pp. 69-75, calls attention to several monuments hitherto practically unknown. In the lunette of the lateral doorway of the church of S. Francesco della Scarpa in Sulmona, is a fresco representing the Madonna between St. Francis and the Magdalen, a good quattrocento work assigned to the local painter, Mastro Giovanni. The terra-cotta Madonna of the church of S. Maria della Tomba, in the same town, is an imported work, by some Tuscan sculptor of the latter half of the sixteenth century. At Scanno the parish church contains an interesting group of four saints, painted on the doors of a niche, with the date 1507. The style is like that of Lo Spagna. The rest of Piccirilli's notes are devoted to pieces of goldsmith's work preserved in the treasury of S. Pietro at S. Pietro Avellana. BOLOGNA.- The Authorship of an Assumption Proved.-- The Assumption in St. Martin's at Bologna was once assigned to Perugino, then by Morelli to Costa, later by Ricci and Venturi to Chiodarolo, by Berenson to Costa, at least in part. F. MALAGUZZI VALERI, in Rass. d' Arte, 1909, p. 60, publishes a note given in 1506 by the prior of this convent to Costa, on account of a painting, which must have been the Assumption. FIESOLE.- New Frescoes. - In a chapel on the estate of the convent of S. Gerolamo at Fiesole are some frescoes in a very bad state of preserva- tion, but of considerable interest, an account of which is given in Burl. Mag. XV, 1909, pp. 180-186, by EMILY H. STEPHENS. The frescoes consist of an Annunciation over the entrance, a remarkable Pieth on the right wall, and a large Christ and Saints in the apse. Miss Stephens suggests a date about 1360, and calls the compositions Giottesque, with Sienese types and feeling. FLORENCE. -A New Giottino.--A. CHIAPELLI, in Rass. d' Arte, 1909, pp. 71-73, describes the fresco recently discovered in a tabernacle on the corner of Via del Leone and Via della Chiesa, which had been closed for centuries (Fig. 7). It represents the Madonna enthroned between angels and saints, and closely enough resembles Giottino's known works to permit of attribution to him.</page><page sequence="35">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 379 A " Noli Me Tangere" in the Uffizi. - There is in the Uffizi gallery a picture by the Venetian Battista Frauco, court painter for a brief period of Cosimo I, and an inde- fatigable imitator of Michelangelo. It is very probable that he used for it the cartoon of Buonarroti which Va- sari says was "colored" by Bronzino, and that we have in it a free copy of Michelangelo's com- position. (C. GAMBA, Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 148-151.) An Uffizi Drawing. -E. JACOBSEN finds in a drawing of the Uffizi (Cornice 26, No. 379) representing a draped standing figure of a youth, the study for the St. Sebastian in a group at the Municipal Mu- seum of Nantes, a picture which was recognized some time ago as a work of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo by F.

The one next him is probably Galeazzo Maria Sforza, inasmuch as the procession is without doubt a reflection of the festivities given in his hodior in 1459 by Cosimo and Piero de' Medici. (G.

MASSARA gives an account of the Castello Visconti at Invorio and par- ticularly discusses the frieze of medallion portraits which ornaments the loggia. These medallions are six in number and represent the six most famous dukes of Milan belonging to the Visconti and Sforza families: Gian</page><page sequence="36">380 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 Galeazzo and Filippo Visconti; Francesco, Gian Galeazzo, Galeazzo Maria, and Ludovico Sforza. There seems a possibility that Bramante designed the frescoes, but they were executed by an inferior hand. MESSINA.- The Works of Art Lost in the Earthquake. - Besides a short rdsum4 of the architectural monuments ruined in the destruction of Messina, Rass. d' Arte, 1909, pp. 25-30, contains an article by G. FuzzoNl on the chief paintings and sculptures which have been lost. Of these the most important are works of Antonello da Messina in the Museo Civico, the "Madonna of the Rosary," and four pieces of a triptych, with saints, and an Annunciation; the Madonna in majolica, by Andrea della Robbia, which adorned the left wall of S. Maria della Scala; an Assumption by Salvo di Antonio, which was kept in the sacristy of the cathedral; and a polychrome statue of the Madonna by Francesco Laurana in Sant' Agostino. A more detailed list is found ibid. p. 47. Chron. Arts, 1909, pp. 20 and 67, announces that the Antonello triptych is unharmed save for damages to the wings. Three Flemish paintings in the museum have been recovered. Seventy-four of the vases made in 1568 at Urbino and Faenza for the Farmacia and Ospedale, the cathedral treasure, and all the Greek manuscripts and the incunabula of the library are also safe. PALADONE. - New Frescoes by Domenico Morone.--A number of frescoes by Domenico Morone in the little church of S. Nicola da Tolentino at Paladone in Valpolicella are published by L. SIMEONI in Madonna Verona, 1909, pp. 67-71. They consist of two series of saints on either side of the altar, both series signed with the artist's name. Certain peculiarities heretofore considered characteristic only of Francesco Morone, Domenico's son, appear in these works, showing that a new-examination of Francesco's oeuvre is needed, to see if some of his paintings are not rather the work of Domenico. Simeoni also points out that there is documentary evidence to show that Domenico did not die about 1508, as assumed by Bernasconi, but was still alive in 1517. PISA.- The Sculptures of S. Michele degli Scalzi.- The sculptured ornament of the main portal of the church of S. Michele degli Scalzi, con- sisting of a half-figure of Christ in the tympanum with nine half-figures, representing the angelic hierarchies, distributed along the lintel, are published for the first time in Rhiv. d'Arte, 1909, pp. 9-18, byG. POGGI. These sculptures are dated 1204, and by reason of their obvious derivatives from the sculptures of the Baptistery, they give a terminus ante quem for the dating of the latter. POASCO. -A Fresco by Luini?--In Rass. d' Arte, 1909, p. 16, D. SANT' AMBROGIO publishes a Sant' Apollonia frescoed on a pilaster in the church at Poasco, near the abbey of Chiaravalle, and dated 1515. It is by the same hand that executed the St. Clement on the opposite pilaster, which was discovered in 1902. The writer suggests that the painter was Luini, and that these frescoes were part of the works ordered by the monks of Chiara- valle, to whom the Poasco church at that time belonged. RAPALLO. - Unknown Pictures. - G. FRIZZONI publishes in L'Arte, 1909, pp. 89-93, a Crucifixion by Van Dyck which exists in the little church of S. Michele near Rapallo, evidently a product of Van Dyck's sojourn at the neighboring Genoa. In the church of S. Francesco in Rapallo itself is a seventeenth century Miracle of St. Anthony of Padua, which tradition assigns to Luciano Borzone.</page><page sequence="37">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 381 ROME. - The Lateran Account-books of the Fifteenth Century. - The list of expenditures of the Lateran from 1432 to 1498 are published in Boll.

Included in the article is a history and description of the Lateran treasure proper, as distinguished from that of the Sancta Sanctorum and the papal treasure deposited in the Lateran. The most interesting of the objects in this treasure are the casket of gilded bronze containing the tunic of St. John Evangelist, with reliefs of the twelfth century; a Limoges casket with the relics of S. Barbara; and the tabernacle containing the hair-cloth of the Magdalen, which is a Renaissance copy of the miniature Temple of Vesta figured in reliefs in the Uffizi and the Lateran itself.

XV, 1909, pp. 113-114, a portrait in the possession of Mr. Alexander Imbert at Rome, which bears the inscription : Macrini mranu, post fata vivam, and is furthur shown to be an auto-portrait of the artist by comparison with the youthful likeness in the collection of Sig. Alfeo Chiaffrino at Bra. The writer adds that the artist's name is properly Macrino d' Alladio, there being no authority for " d' Alba." SIENNA.--A Madonna by Domenico di Bartolo.--F. MASON PERKINS, in Rass. d' Arte Sienese, 1909, pp. 22-25, attributes, on stylistic grounds, the Praying Virgin in the Chiesa del Refugio in Sienna to Domenico di Bartolo. SPOLETO. - The Death of Lo Spagna. - U. GNOLI, having deciphered the inscription on Lo Spagna's frescoes in the little church near the castle of Eggi at Spoleto, finds in it the date 1532. This proves that the painter died between 1532 and 1533, not between 1528 and 1530, as hitherto sup- posed. (Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 13-18.) VERONA. - New Data on Veronese Artists. -G. GEROLA, writing in Madonna Verona, 1909, pp. 24-45, shows from documentary evidence that Liberale da Verona was born about 1445 and died at some time be- tween 1525 and 1529. The writer also comments upon the Giolfino family, and shows that only one of the name, Niccolb di Niccolb Giolfino, was a painter. The date 1486 upon the Pentecost in S. Maria della Scala at Verona is declared a forgery, and thus the objection to assigning it to the younger Niccol6 (born in 1476) is removed. SPAIN SARAGOSSA. - French and Flemish Art at the Exposition.-- E. BERTAUX describes in Gaz. B.-A. XLI, 1909, pp. 85-105, the most interesting pieces of French art which appeared in the exposition held at Saragossa in 1908. Among the most important pieces discussed is the "Virgen de la Vega," a wooden Madonna plated with gilded silver and set with jewels and enamels. It forms part of the treasure of the cathedral of Salamanca, and is a work of the Limoges school of about 1200. Another work of considerable importance is a painting on wood from the treasure of Pampelufia cathedral. It represents a crucifixion, and introduces prophets and church-fathers into the scene in Gothic fashion, but differs materially from the ordinary Gothic iconography. Ibid. pp. 219-239, the same writer</page><page sequence="38">382 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIII, 1909 describes some of the tapestries which were taken from their hiding-places in the two cathedrals of Saragossa and displayed at the exposition. One of these is a Glory of the Virgin, done in Brussels at the beginning of the sixteenth century, which departs from custom in usingthe Samaritan Woman and the Adulteress in the subordinate panels, instead of Esther and Bathsheba, who usually accompany a Glory of the Virgin. An incomplete series of tapes- tries illustrates the story of Geoffrey of Monmouth, which recounts the voyage of Brutus, grandson of Aeneas and eponymous hero of Britain. This is Flemish weaving of about 1460. Another tapestry of about the same date is devoted to the History of the Cross. A History of Jephthah seems to belong to the school of Picardy, from the dialect used in the inscriptions, and dates about 1470. The earliest piece exhibited was a Passion, which cannot be much later than 1400, and is of Northern French or Flemish origin. SILOS. - Sculptures in the Abbey. - E. ROULIN, in R. Art Chre't. 1909, pp. 1-10, catalogues the works of sculpture existing in the abbey-church at Silos, some of them hitherto unpublished. The most interesting are: a statue of the Madonna, which he assigns to the thirteenth century; a St. Anne, Virgin, and Child, a stone group of the fourteenth century; and a relief representing St. Dominic delivering prisoners, of the thirteenth century. Ibid. pp. 75-79 and 166-174, appears an account of the cloisters of this abbey by the same writer, to be continued in later issues of the Revue. FRANCE A MVADONNA OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. - A small Virgin and Child in stone, recently sold for exportation to the United States, is described by H. CHABEUF in R. Art Chre't. 1909, pp. 143-145. He assigns it to Burgundy, and believes that it came originally from Pontailler-sur- Sa6ne, Cate d' Or. DIJON. - Acquisitions of the Museum. - The following objects have recently been added to the collection in the museum at Dijon: a Saints Cosmas and DI)amian, of the Spanish school of the fifteenth century; a Pieth by a Burgundian sculptor of the sixteenth century, a work recently discovered in a private house in Dijon; and an altar-piece of the end of the fifteenth century, containing Passion-scenes. (Chron. Arts, 1909, pp. 126-134.) PARIS.- The Gay Collection at the Louvre.- The Gay Collection at the Louvre is described in Gaz. B.-A. XLI, 1909, pp. 409-432, by G. MI- GEON. The most interesting pieces are a Flemish Madonna of the fifteenth century; an angel forming part of an altar-piece, by Fra Angelico; a mar- ble statuette of an angel belonging to one of the Tuscan schools of the thir- teenth century; a Virgin of the Annunciation, Pisan of the fourteenth cen- tury; an ivory plaque containing the figure of a saint, of the fifth or sixth century; a curious "king" belonging to a chess-set in bone, of the German school of the twelfth century; two bronze plaques of Irish workmanship; a Rhenish champleve of the twelfth century representing a scene of Ezekiel's vision; another chanmpleve and a crucifix of Limnoges workmanship, signed "Johannis Garnerius," and dating from the twelfth century.</page><page sequence="39">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 383 HOLLAND SCHEVENINGEN.- A New Jan Mostaert. - E. WEISS publishes in Z. Bild. K. N. F. XX, 1909, pp. 215-217, a curious landscape which is prob- ably the unfinished West Indian landscape mentioned by Karel van Mander among the artist's works. The picture is in the van Stolk collection at Scheveningen. GERMANY BERLIN.- Acquisitions of the Museum. - The Picture Gallery at Berlin has recently acquired a triptych by Hierri'met de Bles (?) representing the Descent from the Cross in the middle panel, the Holy Family and St. Francis in the wings (Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, col. 110) and a Baptism of Christ begun by Dirk Bouts and finished by a pupil of Ugo van der Goes (described by FRIEDLXNDER, ibid. cols. 209-212). The Museum of Christian Sculpture has received: the stone figure of a kneeling angel, Bavarian of the early fifteenth century (ibid. col. 310); three fragments of early Christian sarcophagi from Rome, of the fourth century; an early Byzantine capital from Saloniki, of the fourth or fifth century; an early Christian marble reliquary in the form of a sarcophagus, from Asia Minor, dating from the sixth to the seventh century; two early Christian bronze ampullae with incised figures, one Roman of the fourth or fifth century, the other Egyptian of the fifth or sixth century; a Lombard breast-plate of the ninth or tenth century; and a Romanesque portrait head, imitating the antique, from Rome, dating in the thirteenth century (ibid. col. 206). The Kupferstich- klabinett has acquired Luini's cartoon for the Europa frescoes in the Picture Gallery (described by BOCK, ibid. cols. 215-220). The Kunstgewerbe Museum has acquired a bookbinding of Catherine de' Medici (described by LOUBIER, ibid. cols. 102-106); a silver and crystal ewer executed from the design of Holbein the younger (described by FALKE, ibid. cols. 125-127) ; a wooden Sacrament tabernacle with reliefs of the Resurrection and angels, Umbrian, of the end of the fifteenth century (described by FALKE, ibid. cols. 141-142); a faience plate with the Nativity painted upon it, and an oven-tile in polychrome relief, with the Cana wedding, - both South German of the six- teenth century (described by FALKE, ibid. cols. 166-171). COLOGNE. - A Forgery in the Museum. - In consequence of Poppel- reuter's articles in Z. Bild. K., the Madonna in the Cologne mInuseum, attrib- uted to Master William, has been thoroughly examined by Braun, director of the Munich Gallery, and Voll, director of the Cologne museum. The former recognizes modern portions in the picture, the latter pronounces the whole work a forgery of the nineteenth century. The question will be sub- mitted to a commission of experts. (Chron. Arts, 1909, p. 150.) RUSSIA KALISCH.-A New Rubens.-- A Descent from the Cross in one of the churches of Kalisch, Poland, has been recognized and proved by docu- mentary evidence to be the work of Rubens. (A. BRYKCZYNSKI, R. Art Chret. 1909, pp. 30-31.) ST. PETERSBURG.- New Pictures at the Hermitage.- G. FnIz-</page><page sequence="40">384 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIII, 1909 ZOmI, in Rass. d' Arte, 1909, pp. 2-3, describes two recent acquisitions of the Hermitage Gallery, consisting of a Madonna by Girolamo Romanino and two wings of an altarpiece representing a mystic conception of Heaven, by Halls Luess von Kulmbach. Pictures in Private Collections.- A loan exhibition held in St. Peters- burg in November and December, 1908, brought forth the 6lite of the old masters in private possession. These are described by J. v. SCHMIDT in Monuatsheftef. Kunstwiss. II, 1909, pp. 161-197. The following are reproduced: a Madonna ascribed to Lippo Memmi; an Annunciation by Raffaelino del Garbo or Filippino Lippi; a North Italian Pieth of the quattrocento; a St. Sebastian by Perugino; a Portrait of a Lady by Piero di Cosimo (?); a Ma- donna ascribed to Leonardo; a Portrait of an Old Man by G.

XV, 1909, pp. 4-8, two portraits in his possession by Behzad (ca. 1475), the greatest of the Persian painters. They formed part of the album in which was found Gentile Bellini's portrait of a Turkish prince (see A. J.A. 1906, p. 366). One, in colors, is the likeness, so the inscription tells us, of a "dervish from Bagdad"; the other is a sketch in pencil for the portrait of the Sultan Husein Mirza. LONDON. -A New Rembrandt. - On February 18, 1909, there was sold in London, under the name of Eeckhout, a panel, 10? inches x 15 inches, entitled David with the Head of Goliath. It has since been recognized as an early work of Rembrandt. It bears the monogram R. H. and a date which seems to be 1631, although on stylistic grounds the picture might be assigned to 1629-30. The brush-work is similar to, but freer than, that of the Money-changer, now in the Berlin museum. The picture was one of a small private collection in Hampshire (A then. April 10, 1909, p. 445). In Burl. Mag. XV, 1909, pp. 71-72, C. PHILLIPS reports that Holmes reads the inscription " R. L. (i.e. Rembrandt Leydensis) 1627." RICHMOND.- Panel in the Cook Collection.--In Burl. Mag. XV, 1909, pp. 107-108, WV. SUIDA publishes a panel in the collection of Sir Frederick Cook at Richmond which he assigns to Conrad Witz. On one side is represented a heavily draped figure, possibly a prophet, and certainly the pendant to another figure on a second panel, now lost. On the back is the kneeling figure of the Magdalen, part of a Noli Me Tangere group. ibid. pp. 173-174, G. HULIN DE Loo and HERBERT COOK assign the panel to a Burgundian master, on the ground of the close resemblance of the Magdalen to the angel in the Annunciation at Aix.</page><page sequence="41">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1909 385 SHREWSBURY. - The Concert at Asolo.-- H. COOK publishes in Burl. Mag. XV, 1909, pp. 38-43, a fite champntre which is in the collection of Lord Bronick at Attingham Hall, near Shrewsbury (Fig. 8). It represents eight young courtiers, some with musical instruments, grouped around a lady, FIGURE 8. - PAINTING AT ATTINGHAM HALL. whom Cook identifies with Catherine Cornaro, queen of Cyprus, regarding the scene as an ideal portrait of that lady's court at Asolo. The figure standing behind the queen he calls Giorgione, and believes that the picture is an eighteenth-century replica of an original by that master. AFRICA MILIANA. - A Christian Epitaph. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1908, p. 291, P. MONCEAUx publishes a Christian epitaph found at Miliana, Algeria, and dated in the year 314. It is the first Christian inscription on this site and is evidence for the presence of Christians in the interior of Mauretania at the beginning of the fourth century. UNITED STATES BOSTON. -An Acquisition of the Museum. -By the gift of Mrs. John HI. Wright, the Museum of Fine Arts has become the possessor of a large Flemish tapestry dating from the second half of the fifteenth century.
