<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cheryl B. Torsney Mrs. Wickham's "Dogs of Noted Americans" The archives of the Western Reserve Historical Society house a fasci nating file (mss. 2807) that, undoubtedly, few scholars have bothered to investigate since its very title appears so mundane and domestic as to be laughable.1 Catalogued as "Sixty-eight letters to Mrs. Gertrude Van Rensselaer Wickham, chiefly about their dogs," this file contains the letters that constituted Wickham's preliminary research for an essay she wrote entitled "Dogs of Noted Americans" for the June 1888 number of the nineteenth-century children's magazine St. Nicholas.2 The first woman to hold an editorial position on a Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper and the author of five volumes of genealogical history of the Western Reserve, Wickham had written to selected statesmen, writers, actors, and other notables asking about their experiences with their dogs. The positive replies, which she thought would interest her juvenile audience and their parents, she rendered into her own third person account. The respondents, five of whom wrote two letters to Wickham, com prise a varied bunch, some with names we recognize today, some whose fame has faded into the fabric of history. Alphabetically, Wick ham's correspondents are as follows: J. B. Aldrich (2), Florence Arliss, Newton D. Baker, W. B. Beard, Mrs. Henry W. Beecher, Edwin Booth, Robert J. Burdette, John Burroughs, Will Carleton, Frank G. Carpenter, John M. Clay, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, Rose Terry Cooke, Susan Coolidge, Mary Abigail Dodge, George F. Edwards, Edward Eggleson, E. W.

In designing her survey, Wickham undoubtedly hoped for responses that would validate her belief in the importance of canine companion ship.3 Indeed, many of her respondents replied in that vein, allowing Wickham to testify to the devotion of the famous to their dogs, in effect implying a didactic message, a cause-and-effect relationship between caring for dogs and fame. For example, of John Greenleaf Whittier's dogs, she writes: "Our beloved Quaker poet was a farmer's son and therefore was brought up among dogs and horses and cattle, and became fond of them all. He is rich in dogs." Of Frances Hodgson Burnett, Wickham recounts: "The first great sorrow of her childhood, amounting in her eyes to an awful tragedy, was occasioned by love of a dog." Among the most interesting responses to her inquiries, however, were those from American writers who, unbeknownst to Wickham, were not dog lovers. These replies reveal a side of several authors' per sonal lives we have rarely or never seen in their biographies, letters, essays, or fiction. Some of her correspondents' answers are whimsical or wistful, like that from Mary Abigail Dodge, who answers Wick ham's query as to whether she has ever had a dog with "Dear Madam, Only the dog-star—which shines for all." Other replies declare the writer's fear of dogs. William Dean Howells answers Wickham's request for a picture of his pet with "I have no dog, and I am very much afraid of other people's. In the chronic absence of the dog it is difficult even to send you his photograph." Lucy Larcom responds in a similar vein: "I am a dogless woman. I never had one, and was terri bly afraid of the race, in my childhood. Perhaps I had too often heard the text 'Without are dogs.' Certainly, I have always lived without dogs. My only pets, since my doll-days, have been little children. I have had many human pets." Rose Terry Cooke echoes both Larcom's</page><page sequence="3">260 biography Vol. 16, No. 3 sentiment and allusion: "I never owned but one dog, &amp; that much against my will. I heartily believe &amp; rejoice in the Scripture declaration that 'without are—dogs' as well as sundry other unclean and danger ous things." Wickham must have found equally disappointing some of the responses offered by relatives of deceased "Noted Americans." Samuel Longfellow, for example, writes that his brother "had no special inter est in animals; never had ... a dog of his own, or any pet creature." Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher responds similarly "that although fond of dogs, Mr. Beecher had none that have any especial history—none that he was particularly fond of." The persistent investigator of pet histories also received information regarding the animal fancies of three of the titans of nineteenth-cen tury American literature in letters from E. W. Emerson, Julian Haw thorne, and Samuel Clemens. Undoubtedly, Wickham was abashed by her new-found knowledge that her literary gods did not share her ado ration of dogs. Clemens, while polite, refuses to come clean about the topic; his entire missive reads as follows: "Although I can't do it, I've still no business to be this long saying so. I beg a thousand pardons—it is all a busy procrastinator can do." Julian Hawthorne encourages the journalist in her efforts to prompt people to write about their dogs but regrets that Mrs. Wickham will have to say "that Nathaniel Haw thorne never kept a dog, and cared little or nothing about them [sic]: his predilection was rather for cats; and in both these respects his son takes after him. Dogs and cats do not agree, and where one enters in, the other fears to tread." In writing from Concord, Emerson's son offers what must have been a blow to Wickham's implied desire that her idols love dogs as much as she, for his tone is indeed ironic. In young Emerson's response we see his father as a funny man, a role he never played in public life. He writes: "My answer to your question must be short and, I fear, unsatisfactory. My father had no liking for dogs, either in his youth or mature life and never kept one. He used to read us with amusement, not without sympathy, how when a lady asked the Rev. Sydney Smith for a motto to be engraved on the collar of her little dog "Spot" the divine suggested the line from Macbeth as fitting 'Out! damned Spot.' " For evidence concerning how many nineteenth-century literary, social, and political celebrities related to one aspect of domestic life, the keeping of pets, Gertrude Van Rensselaer Wickham's gathering of letters regarding the dogs of noted Americans is significant. Although her St. Nicholas article paints the domestic scene with the dog as a</page><page sequence="4">Torsney mrs. wickham's "dogs of noted Americans" 261 focal point and as such is quite nearly a genre piece given the numbers of contemporary articles published on similar subjects, the Western Reserve Historical Society's mss. 2807 reveals that the hearths of many famous nineteenth-century Americans were canine-less. That Wickham suppressed these letters noting a dislike for dogs, or simply that she never wrote a companion piece entitled "Noted Americans Who Hate (or Fear) Dogs," attests to the powerful image of the ideal American family, which in the nineteenth century included man's best friend.4 Department of English West Virginia University NOTES 1. I cite the contents of mss. 2807 with the permission of the Western Reserve Histori cal Society. 2. The Western Reserve Historical Society maintains closed stacks; thus one needs to request Mss. no. 2807 "68 letters to Mrs. Gertrude Van R[ensselaer] Wick ham, chiefly about their dogs" from the reference desk. The manuscript folder contains a listing of the contents, the holograph manuscripts of the 68 letters, and a three-page typescript "Memorial to Mrs. Wickham" by Mrs. Elizabeth Neff, catalogued as "Mss. V.f.W." Neff details Wickham's ancestry (she was a descendant of the Tilleys who arrived on the Mayflower); notes her accom plishments in education (she was the first woman public school principal in Ohio); comments on her journalistic triumphs (she began the society page of the Cleveland Herald as well as serving as writer and editor for several other papers during the course of her career); praises her social activism (she founded a shop where needy gentlewomen could sell their baked goods and handiwork); and notes her work with the Western Reserve Chapter of the DAR. The penultimate sentence of the eulogy reads: "She was an omniverous [sic] reader, a keen critic, with original opinions."

Dogs were well integrated into the domestic life of Victorian England and America, Flush Browning being, perhaps, the most famous dog with literary owners. In her entry on "Dogs and Dogshows" for Victorian Britain: An Encyclopedia, Cynthia Huff notes: "The Victorians' relationship with their dogs reflects the contradictory and complex nature of their society." They established the Soci ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, but they also reveled in dog fighting. Citing evidence such as Charles Crufts's establishing a class for stuffed dogs at the Newcastle Dog Show and Edwin Landseer's paintings of anthropomorphic dogs engaged in human activity, Huff asserts that the strong relationship between humans and dogs formed "a bond [that] cut across class boundaries" and was "important both realistically and symbolically in Victo rian England."</page><page sequence="5">262 biography Vol. 16, No. 3 Although Huff focuses on dogs in Britain, similar sentiments flourished in America. As James Turner details in Reckoning with the Beast, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded on April 21, 1866. The sev enties and eighties brought the vivisection controversy, the American Anti Vivisectionist Society being organized by Caroline White in Philadelphia in 1883, with anti-vivisectionism reaching its peak in the nineties, under the organization of the Washington Humane Society. By the end of the century, however, concern for animals and the SPCA's that represented them was on the wane, according to Turner. Earlier "there had been few socially legitimate outlets for humanitarian impulses. Self-interest, custom, and laissez-faire ideologies conspired to discourage, at least among the conventionally minded middle classes, concerted action to ease human suffering." New legislation and social services had, by the turn of the century, brought the plight of children, the poor, and others under scrutiny, shifting the focus of concern away from animals (Turner 123). The contemporary press attested to the fact that pets, but specifically dogs, consoli dated and thus represented many of the significant virtues of nineteenth-cen tury domesticity—loyalty, responsibility, and religious devotion. As James Turner notes, "love for animals appeared to many as the purest type of com passion" (14). Harper's Weekly (6 February 1869, as reprinted in Turner), for example, featured a plate entitled "The Long Sleep," which depicts two large dogs eagerly waiting for their master to awaken. Ouida's (Marie Louise de la Ramée) A Dog of Flanders (1872), which features a loyal dog that dies in the end, was wildly successful and served as a plea for the humanitarian treatment of animals. Under "Dog" and "Dogs," Poole's Index to Periodical Literature offers over 80 entries for 1802-81, many of which appeared in more than one publication; 36 entries for 1882-87; 30 entries for 1887-92; 19 for 1892-96; 41 entries for 1897-1901. The articles fall into several categories, among them personal narratives; "how to" pieces on training, showing, feeding, grooming; descriptions of classes and breeds; and analyses of biology and psychology. In a class by itself are the various essays on dogs in literature and dogs of the famous, which include "Shakespearean Dogs," "George Eliot's Dogs," "Dogs in Homer," "Some Poets' Dogs," "The Queen's Dogs," "Dogs in British Poe try," "Dogs in Literature," "Dogs in Poetry," "Mademoiselle Finmette: [An] Anecdote about the Dog of Lamartine," "Sir Walter Scott and His Dogs." In other words, Wickham, who published "Dogs of Noted Americans" in 1888, was firmly entrenched in the Victorian convention of sentimental writing about animals. We might do well at this point to heed the warning of James Turner: "We tend now, with good reason, to smile at the sentimentality and anthropo morphism of Victorian animal lovers. But we cannot afford to let our amuse ment turn to condescension" (14). 4. The ideology of pets remains a powerful influence on our identities and feelings of well-being, as demonstrated by articles in the popular press, such as Eileen Drenick's "True Blue" (about the loss of her pet cat), The New York Times Magazine 1 October 1990: 24; Abigail McCarthy's "One of the Family: Eric the Unforgettable," Commonweal 10 March 1989, 135; Robert James Waller's "Song for Roadcat," Reader's Digest Feb. 1991: 145; and "Pets of the Famous: A Variety of Animals Find Love and Care in the Homes of Celebrities," Ebony</page><page sequence="6">Torsney mrs. wickham's "dogs of noted Americans" 263 Oct. 1988: 31-33. The professional press is equally interested in pets these days, as exemplified by pieces such as Judith M. Siegel's "Stressful life events and use of physician services among the elderly: the moderating role of pet ownership," Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 58.6 (June 1990): 1081-86; and D. Terri Heath and Patrick C. McKenry's "Potential benefits of companion animals for self-care children," Childhood Education 65.5: 311-14. That pets are perceived as an important part of the ideal American family of two parents and 1.5 children has received a dramatic critique in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye, which takes to task the ideality not only of Dick and Jane but also of Spot and Puff.
