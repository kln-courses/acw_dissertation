<plain_text><page sequence="1">SMALL VASES FROM EUBOEAN WORKSHOPS* (PLATES I-4.) PERHAPS the most popular vase shape in Euboea in the fourth century was the lidded lekanis. A number of specimens, decorated with floral motives on the lid and simple leaves or linear patterns on the receptacles, may be seen in BSA lv, pls. 54-57 passim. They show considerable variety in the shape of the knobs and in the treatment of the handles,' but the receptacles remain fundamentally the same. Akin to these are little bowls of similar shape, lidded, but without handles. Such are the vases of a kernos of unknown provenience in Athens2 with a vaguely anthropomorphic central handle consisting of a long loop surmounted by a moulded head and with small arm-like projections recalling those of a herm3 (PLATE I, I). The lids of three of the four little vases are preserved, the two nearest the handle having horizontal rims, while the two outer vases both had lids with rims turning vertically down, as is shown by the one extant lid and by the flanges on both the receptacles. The knobs of the two lids with horizontal rims are of a shape similar to the stemmed foot of a cup or dish; the surviving lid with down-turned rim has a ring like the footring of a stemless cup to serve as a knob. Each kind of knob, stemmed or stemless, functioned as a foot when the lid was set upside down on the table and became a dish. The low footring knobs were not unknown in Athens, but they were commoner in Euboea. One was noticed in BSA lv. 212, no. 8 on a lid, not figured, belonging to the Bonn group of floral black-figure, which is undoubtedly of Euboean, and very probably of Chalcidian manufacture. We shall see more of them later on. `l'he simple patterns that decorate the sides of the bowls of the kernos do not convey much information. The broken key of the inner two could occur almost anywhere. The wave pattern on the bowl at the left end was also common property, but among those who used it were, we know, Euboean painters of floral vases. See the vase in the shape of a marriage lobes in Chalcis, ibid. pls. 52. I, 2; 53. I, where the wave is to be found on both lid and body, a deep lidded bowl in Chalcis, ibid. pl. 53. 4, where it is just discernible in the illustration, bordering the lid, and a lekythos in Reading, ibid. pl. 6. 4, where it decorates the shoulder. The alternate eggs and vertical buds or bars on the body of the fourth vase and along the edge of the base of the kernos, occur again on the lid of the third vase from the left (PLATE I, 2 c), though there the eggs are splayed out in the manner of chevrons to adapt them to the circular field. A larger lid4 with the same pattern of rounded chevrons and bars was found in Eretria and is now in the National Museum at Athens, and similar rounded chevrons occasionally replace the normal pointed chevrons in the hearts of Euboean palmettos, e.g. those of the deep lidded bowl in Chalcis just referred to, ibid. pl. 53. 3, 4. The metope-like decoration of spots and bars on the rim of this third kernos lid is found in the same position on the lid of the tiny pyxis which itself forms the knob of the marriage lobes in Chalcis mentioned above, ibid. pl. 53. I, though there we have single bars instead of pairs to separate the metopes.

I, xii. I, xiv. I, xv. 3. There is evidence for its use in Euboea in the fifth century also,5 which brings it nearer to our kernos. The clay of the kernos is yellow, resembling that of much of the ware in Chalcis Museum,6 and for this reason, combined with the fact that the painted patterns are seen also on vases found in Eretria and Chalcis, or otherwise recognized as Euboean, we may assign the kernos to a Euboean workshop. A little larger than the kernos vases and of finer quality are several small pyxides, either angular in profile like the kernos bowls or almost globular. PLATE I, 3 shows three of these in the National Museum at Athens. Like the kernos they have no known provenience. The lekanis- shaped bowl on the right, E 151 17 (PLATE I, 3 c) has on the lid the same footring knob and down- turned rim as the surviving lid of the outer vases of the kernos. On the rim there is the metope pattern of spots and pairs of bars that we have seen already on the third lid of the kernos and elsewhere, and on the top of the lid (PLATE I, 2f) palmettos with honeysuckle leaves are seen together with others of traditional shape (four honeysuckle with two normal). The palmettos have a heart of an uncommon kind consisting of a chevron within an arc, and each palmetto is flanked by a tendril which makes a weak S curve, turning away from the palmetto in a manner that recalls the flanking tendrils of a group of floral vases that has been shown to be probably Euboean of about 424 B.c.8 They may also be compared with the tendrils on a cup of Euboean o??r?ra fnnr,ra at nwnthlie 9 1 Sir John Beazley has observed10 that the alternation of honeysuckle- and traditional-leaved palmettos (sprung and unsprung) is not common on Greek floral bands. He cites only a clay sima from Olympia, a Campanian red-figured guttus in Oxford and a column-base from the temple of Apollo at Didyma." Here we have it on a vase made in Euboea. It occurs again on a floral lekanis in Reading, BSA lv, p1.57.2, 4, also Euboean. This raises the question whether the frequent occurrence of the two varieties of palmetto together on Etruscan vases can be due to influence from Chalcis or Eretria. There are other resemblances also between Euboean and Etruscan floral patterns. For example, the black-figured floral band below the lip of the Turmuca krater in the Cabinet des Medailles, EVP pl. xxxi. I, 2, has a number of features in common with Euboean floral vases in addition to the alternation of honeysuckle and traditional palmettos just mentioned: chevron hearts, single or double, in the palmettos; flowers with honeysuckle petals (cf. BSA lv. 213, fig. 2 a, b, pl. 54. 3, 5); tendrils that flank each palmetto, turning in towards the middle leaf but stopping short of it in a way corresponding to that of the tendrils on Euboean floral vases of Groups E, G, and some of C, which have evolved from the button-hook tendrils of Groups A to D of the Euboean floral vases published ibid. 211 if., see pls. 55. 5, 6. 4, 6, 8, 57. I, 4. The drawing of the b.f. floral border of the Turmuca krater, reproduced from Monuments Inediti ii, p1.9 in EVP p1. xxxi. 2, is not accurate in making the side- tendrils arch over the tops of the palmettes.12 They come to an end in the way just described. Compare also the framing tendrils of Etruscan jugs such as Wurzburg 802, Langlotz pl. 229, and Oxford 1920.32, EVP pl. xxxviii. 3. Further, in the r.f. handle florals of the Turmuca krater there are stemmed flowers springing from each side of the middle leaf of the palmettos. This not very common motive is seen also in palmettos and lotuses of the Bonn group and the Ferorelli s On the base of a skyphos in Reading, Hesperia xxxi (1962) p1. 113. 6 BSA lv. 217. 7 H. 6 cm., diam. 7.5 cm. 8 BIOS viii (1961) 1 {f., p1. i. 1-4. 9 Robinson, Olynthus xiii, p1. 12.3. ?o Etruscan Vase painting 183 (EVP).

URE group of Euboean floral vases, BSA Iv, pl. 52. 3, 4, 54. 2, 4-6. It is possible that further study of Euboean pottery will reveal other stylistic links with Etruscan.I3 Near to E 151 I in size are two fat, almost globular little pyxides'4 in Athens, E 1512 and i4716, PLATE I, 3 a, b; lids 2e, d.'s E 1512 has the same warm brownish clay as E 151 I, the other is of paler clay and is inferior in quality, but the two vases undoubtedly belong together. The lid of E 1512, like the second lid of the kernos and the receptacle of the Reading lekanis BSA Iv, pl. 57. 2, has an open cable. That of 14716 is adorned with rather nondescript palmettes and flowers within a ring of dots. Of rougher make is a third vase of the same shape in Reading, PLATE 2, 7,16 with a laurel wreath round the body and eggs on the lid within a border of dots more widely spaced than those of the other globular vases. This inferior vase was heavily ruddled; the two of better quality in Athens had no added miltos. The very streaky black glaze round the bottom of the receptacle of the Reading pyxis does not reach as far as the foot, but leaves a band reserved just above it. A reserved band in this position is familiar in Euboean wares.7 This last little pyxis has a peculiarity which serves to confirm its attribution to Euboea. The painter, as he finished painting the black band round the lower part of the vase, lifted his brush with a turn of the wrist that drove it out of its course, leaving a tongue of black glaze protruding into the zone occupied by the laurel spray, see PLATE 2, 7. This final flourish was apparently condoned in Euboean workshops, for it is seen several times, especially on vases which appear to have been made in Chalcis. For instance, it occurs twice on the name vase of the Ferorelli group of Euboean floral vases, BSA Iv, pl. 54- 5, which was almost certainly made in Chalcis, and on a Euboean floral lekythos in Reading (not on the side shown, ibid. pl. 56. 4). It is also found on sixth-century vases, e.g. on a black-figured lekythos, with boxers, made of the soft yellow clay characteristic of pottery associated with Chalcis. Other instances of its occurrence on sixth-century pottery will be noticed later. Apparently related to the little globular pyxides is a small stemmed kothon, Athens E 1520, PLATE 2, 8, of unknown provenience. Its only decoration consists of stemless ivy leaves and plain black tongues, with black blobs on the mouldings above and below the ivy. Its attribution to Euboea gains support from the fact that rows of similar tongues and ivy leaves occur together on the shoulder of a much damaged b.f. hydria from Eretria in the British School at Athens,8S PLATE 2, 2. In a panel, against a background patterned with dot clusters symmetrically arranged, there are two women dancing towards the right, one behind the other. This vase in turn goes with a little hydria of about the same size, though of different shape, in Cambridge,19 CVA ii, pl. xxx. 15, of unknown provenience, which has the same shoulder decoration and on the body two ducks walking towards the right, one behind the other. Another example of stemless ivy leaves used as shoulder decoration in Eretria is seen in PLATE 4, 2, which shows an oenochoe from there in the National Museum, Athens. Whether our group of little pyxides and the kothon are to be assigned to Eretria rather than to Chalcis it is impossible to say at this stage. There are some small lidded bowls, more or less resembling those of the kernos, and only slightly larger (diameter 6-5 compared with 5"5 cm.), with a band of vertical bars, straight or wavy, on the receptacle. This simple decoration is exceedingly common on handled bowls and lekanides in Euboea.20 Of these little handleless bowls Chalcis 667 (PLATE 3, I), from a grave near Chalcis, has vertical bars that closely resemble those of the lekanis of the Ferorelli group in 13 A number of sixth-century vases from Etruscan sites, and especially from Vulci, seem to be more closely related to what we know of Euboean black-figure than to Attic. 14 The resemblance in shape between these and the sixth- century Corinthian pyxides, Payne NC 305 f., fig. 141, is probably fortuitous.

Very near to it (though the lid is nearer to that of the end kernos bowl) is one found on the acropolis at Halae, Hesperia 1940, 458, fig. 136, where the ivy is replaced by a spotted sinuous line. The receptacle of another in Chalcis is shown in PLATE 4, 9. The lid of another, Chalcis 653, has a footring knob surrounded by concentric moulded bands, alternately black and reserved, the latter ruddled, PLATE 3, 3. Another, larger and broader, is Athens 2504,2 PLATE 3, 6, black inside and out except the resting surfaces of the footrings (both knob and foot proper), which are reserved and grooved, the base of the receptacle, which is reserved with a black spot within a circle, and a reserved disk inside the lid underneath the footring knob, which has a central spot and two circles. The provenience of this vase is not known, but it has a typically Euboean reserved band above the junction of body and foot, in this case carried over the upper part of the foot itself. The space enclosed within the footring knob is black, like that of the lid with floral decoration belonging to the Bonn group mentioned above, BSA Iv. 212, no. 8.zz Other handleless lidded bowls of the same shape and with footring knobs have no painted decoration, the surface being left perfectly plain or treated with a glaze wash. The inside of the lid, and sometimes of both lid and receptacle, is washed over with a thin streaky black glaze. Six of these vases are known. There are four in Chalcis Museum (73o, 663b, 663a, 1368,23 PLATE 3, 4, 5, 8, 9), one in Thebes Museum (249,24 PLATE 3, 7, Io), and a fragmentary lid was found in the Athenian Agora (PI4043,25 PLATE 3, 2). All have horizontal grooves except Chalcis 663b, where the surface is smooth and has been ruddled. The clay is generally a yellow- ish buff, but the two larger and coarser in Chalcis (663a and 1368) have fired red in the kiln. The smallest and daintiest, Chalcis 730, is very like Chalcis 667, the vase with the ivy wreath, in shape and size. It has a footring and a footring knob which are almost identical with one another. This is rarely the case, and does not occur on any of the others. The pyxis in Thebes, PLATE 3, 7, has impressed palmettes and eggs alternating on a smooth band between the grooves on the lid, and exactly the same decoration is seen on the Agora lid, PLATE 3, 2. It is not known where the vase in Thebes came from, but the fact that four of the six are from the neighbourhood of Chalcis, in addition to the yellow or yellowish clay, points to their being of Chalcidian origin. There is also another Chalcidian feature. In the inside of the receptacle of the vase in Thebes we see the brush stroke leaving its circular course with the distinctive flourish that we noticed above on vases of Chalcis, PLATE 3, IO. The pyxis is not the only shape in unpainted ware that can be attributed to Euboea. In Athens there is an unpainted vase, E 1588,26 PLATE 4, I, in the shape of an egg open at the top, and with a small foot, which appears to be of the same fabric. This general resemblance is sup- ported by the provenience of a vase of similar shape in Bonn,27 decorated only with bands, one broad and one narrow, PLATE 4, 3. It comes from Eretria, and may be compared with an amphora with broad and narrow bands in Eretria Museum, BSA lii, pl. 7 h, which Boardman regards as virtually certain to be of local manufacture, ibid. 2 I1. The slight difference of shape may be accounted for by a different place of origin if, as seems likely, the vase with bands was made in Eretria, where it was found, while the unpainted egg vase, like the unpainted pyxides, was made in Chalcis. A third vase in the shape of an open egg, Yale 190, Baur, Catalogue of the Stoddard Collection 121, fig. 44,28 may perhaps be classed with the two in Athens and Bonn as Euboean. It is decorated with an ivy wreath. 21 H. 6-3 cm., diam. 9-2 cm. 22 Now illustrated in Archaeologia Classica xiv (1962) pl. xxi. 2. 23 H. 5'5 cm., diam. 6-7 cm.; H. 6-5 cm., diam. 9"7 cm.; H. 9 cm., diam.

URE The protruding tongue of black paint mentioned above, p. 16, where the brush has swung off course, is seen on the 'Comma class' of sixth-century skyphoi from Rhitsona, PLATE 2, 5, 6. These are short and squat, averaging only 4 to 5 cm. in height, and with a flat reserved base.29 Groups of simple ornament in the handle zone sometimes take the form of zigzags, sometimes chevrons, sometimes commas. The decoration of the lower part of the body consists only of black bands, from the lowest of which in five cases out of nine the brush swings upward and trespasses into the reserved band above in precisely the same way as on the fourth-century globular pyxis in Reading, PLATE 2, 7, and on the Ferorelli pyxis, BSA Iv, pl. 54. 5, which latter was undoubtedly made in Euboea, and almost certainly in Chalcis. Grave 5o, a mid-sixth- century interment, contained seven specimens3o among the 400oo-odd objects buried at one single funeral. The contemporary grave 49 contained two3' in a total of more than 450 funeral gifts. Although a large proportion of the vases offered to the dead were plainly taken from pegs on the walls in the home of the donor, funerals that were furnished in such a lavish manner as this must have caused a run on the local pottery shops. Chalcis is only five miles from Rhitsona as the crow flies, and it would probably have been the natural shopping centre in normal times for the people of the district, just as it is today. If the decease of a prominent citizen of Mycalessus caused a sudden demand for vases in excess of normal requirements it would be much quicker to send to Chalcis for them than to either of the great pottery centres of Thebes or Tanagra. That they did so is proved for the latter half of the sixth century by a number of black-figured vases from Rhitsona graves that can be shown to be Euboean.32 Of the same cheap fabric as the Comma class is one considerably larger skyphos from Rhitsona grave 31,33 PLATE 2, 3, a burial to be dated in the last decade of the sixth century.34 There is a second in Thebes, inv. 175,35 PLATE 2, I, 4, of which the provenience is not known. Both have a broad black band round the body of the vase with a pair of lines above and below, those below cutting brutally through the rays in the lowest zone. On the base both vases have the large spot within a small circle referred to above, p. 15, as characteristic of sixth-century Euboean lekanai. In the handle zone Rhitsona 31.41 has stemless ivy leaves and dots, Thebes 175 carelessly painted leaves or blobs. Not many kylikes are recognizable as Euboean.36 Judging from three plain little cups in Chalcis Museum, the potters of Chalcis had a partiality for long handles with an upward lift, generally rising some way above the level of the rim. PLATE 4, 4, 5 shows 626,37 from a grave near Chalcis, and a smaller, unnumbered.38 Both have the broad handle zone reserved and empty, and on 626, as so often in Euboea, there is a reserved band immediately above the foot, extending, like that of Athens 2504, p. I7, over the upper part of the foot itself. Inside they have a comparatively broad reserved band just inside the lip, and both are heavily ruddled. PLATE 4, 6 shows a poor specimen, 652,39 all black except the resting surface of the foot. A cup with palmettes from Olynthus mentioned above, p. 15, also has long handles (one only survives) and an out-turning lip somewhat like the cup in Chalcis, PLATE 4, 5- Finally, there are in Chalcis a deep cup and a skyphos both numbered 737,40 decorated with 29 These little cups must be distinguished from the even smaller Corinthian skyphoi found in great abundance at Rhitsona from the middle of the sixth to the last quarter of the fifth century, e.g. Ure, Aryballoi and Figurines pl. xx, 138. 1-6; Sixth and Fifth pl. xxiv, I1I4a. 1-5. 30 Nos. 16-22, BSA xiv. 258. 3, Nos. io, I , ibid. 251. 32 A study of these is in preparation. 33 No. 41, BSA xiv. 273.

Both vases have reserved bands imme- diately above the foot and the upper part of the foot is reserved. To sum up, we have assembled a miscellaneous collection of simple pottery which from its clay, soft and yellow, yellowish-buff, or brown, from its provenience, from elements of its decoration or peculiarities in technique can be associated with Chalcis. One or two pieces are from Eretria and others may belong to Eretria or some other Euboean centre. Outside Euboea we have found Euboean ware at Rhitsona and Halae, both very well situated for trading with Chalcis. The vase from Olynthus may be a local imitation rather than an import. Neither would be surprising in the region of Chalcidice. The vases from Rhitsona can be dated by associated finds. The skyphoi of the Comma class are dated by the rich contents of graves 49 and 50 in the middle of the sixth century, and the larger skyphoi related to them are similarly put by grave 3' in the last quarter of the century. The skyphos and cup Chalcis 737 are shown by internal evidence to belong to the latter part of the sixth century, and so too the jug with the ivy band from Eretria. The kothon and the two little hydriai come within the first half of the fifth century. The small globular pyxides are not easy to date. The lidded bowl E i 5 i i which goes with them has links with a kylix from the polyandrion of the Thespians who fell in 424 B.c., and it may take the globular pyxides with it into the middle of the last half of the fifth century. The kernos cannot be very far from E iii. 5 We may put it provisionally about 400 B.C. The bulk of the rest will fall well within the fourth century. A. D.
