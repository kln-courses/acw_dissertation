<plain_text><page sequence="1">John A. Ball Views Extraterrestrial Intelligence: Where Is Everybody? Our current world view seems to predict the existence of advanced civilizations in the galaxy and make interacting with us easy for them. Why haven't they? Since before the dawn of recorded history, men and women have won dered and worried about their place in the universe. Who am I? Why am I? What should I do? Myths and stories supplied answers to those willing to believe them. As mankind accumulated more and more infor mation about the physical world, those myths that were incompatible were replaced, reluctantly, by new myths. Thus science progresses. Today our world view contains myths and stories with a scale and grandeur that make those of our ancestors seem like nursery rhymes. The epic of big bang cosmology far surpasses in magnificence, if not in eloquence, the stories in Homer and the Bible. The saga of the evolution of mankind from primeval life contains more drama and suspense than Beowulf or the Vedas. Some of the myths and stories of modern science might even be true. Persistent through the ages has been the idea, taken for granted by most people, that mankind is not the most advanced intelligence in the universe. Gods have come and gone, but the idea of gods or superior beings is one of the most nearly universal themes in human culture. But wishing will John Ball is a radio astronomer with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He received his B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Ne braska and his Ph.D. from Harvard. He has been involved in radio-astronomical observing programs at many of the major radio obser vatories. He participated in the discovery of several new molecules in interstellar space: methyl alcohol, formic acid, acetaldehyde, SO, ethyl alcohol, and NS.

There are perhaps 1011 galaxies in the known universe, some 80% of which are spiral. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a typical spiral galaxy, intermediate or ordinary in every property that we know how to measure or calculate. The Milky Way is not outstanding or special, although we suppose that it is unique in that no other galaxy is ex actly like it. The Milky Way contains some 1012 stars and lots of other material such as gas and dust. Our star, the sun, is intermediate or ordinary in every property that we know how to mea sure or calculate: size (mass and di ameter), color (i.e. surface tempera ture), chemical composition, age, and location in the galaxy. In one respect the sun might seem to be extraordi nary; no other star is known to have a planetary system comparable to ours. But this can be understood in terms of the extreme difficulty of observing planets around other stars. Although the near future promises notable im provements (Gatewood et al. 1980; Davies 1980; Bracewell and MacPhie 1979), extrasolar planets would go undetected with our present tech nology. Speculation is, however, that many stars have planets. Among only nine known planets, our planet, Earth, is intermediate or or dinary in size (mass and diameter), temperature, chemical composition, age (all the planets in the solar system are probably about as old as the sun), and location. In one respect Earth might seem to be extraordinary; no other planet is known to have life. But this can be understood in terms of the relative fragility of known life forms which require complex organic chemistry in a wet environment. No other place in the solar system seems to be suitable for life to originate. Among life forms on Earth, our species, mankind, is ordinary in some respects but outstanding in intelli gence. The question of why we are thus outstanding may not be a meaningful question, but if it is, an answer may be that any significantly less intelligent species is incapable of asking such a question. Or perhaps our seemingly unusual status is re lated to our failure to be aware of ex traterrestrial intelligence (ETI). But here is a problem; unlike extrasolar planets, we should be able to interact with ETI, if it exists. Given a desire on the part of ETI, interaction should be easy. As Von Hoerner (1973) asks, Where is everybody? Three premises Three premises or hypotheses are used in most discussions of the prob lems of extraterrestrial life. These premises are stated below with a dis cussion of their origin and references to the literature. Although the dis cussion is brief, these premises are crucial, and all the other ideas in this paper are based on them. 1. Whenever the conditions are such that life can originate and evolve, it will. The origin of life is taken to be a chemical reaction that occurs when ever the necessary reactants are present under the appropriate con ditions for a sufficient time. This is a considerable extrapolation of our present knowledge; we do not yet understand just how the first living organisms came about. Life's raw materials?amino acids and other complex organic compounds?were present, for they form spontaneously in laboratory simulations of the pri mordial Earth. (See, e.g., Oparin 1938; 656 American Scientist, Volume 68</page><page sequence="2">Ponnamperuma 1972; Miller and Orgel 1974; and many other refer ences therein.) Although we cannot yet create life from nonliving mate rial, possibly because the time scale is too long, I predict that this will be achieved in the near future. We do have the rudiments of a theoretical understanding of the formation of complex systems?dissipative struc tures in nonequilibrium thermody namics. (See, e.g., Glansdorff and Prigogine 1971 and Prigogine et al. 1972.) The development from bacte ria and algae to human beings is, by comparison, well understood in terms of Darwinian evolution. The opposite hypothesis, that life is statistically unlikely even in ideal conditions, is still possible. Discovery of living organisms, however primi tive, anywhere else in the universe, provided only that contamination from Earth is ruled out, would settle the question. One example of life could be a fluke; with two examples we can do statistics. 2. There are many places where life might originate. Planets are probably quite common in the galaxy. We now understand reasonably well the origin of our solar system and, presumably, of other planetary systems. (See, e.g., Levin 1964; Reeves 1972; Ward 1976.) Contracting protostars almost always contain substantial angular momen tum which originated as turbulence in the interstellar medium. Protostars can solve this angular-momentum problem in three ways: (1) form a bi nary or multiple-star system with most of the angular momentum in the orbital revolution, (2) become a rap idly rotating star with most of the angular momentum in this rotation (this alternative seems to apply only to stars significantly more massive than the sun), or (3) as the sun has done, form a protoplanetary disk and eventually a planetary system. In our solar system some 61% of the total angular momentum is in the orbital revolution of one planet?Jupiter. If this idea is correct, then we should find planets around almost all stars that are neither members of binary or multiple-star systems nor rapidly rotating. Such stars are very ap proximately 13% of all stars and thus we might expect to find more than 1011 planetary systems in our galaxy. A very large percentage of these planetary systems probably contain a planet with conditions suitable for the origin of life. 3. We are unaware of ETI. Digression on good questions Any reader who really wants to find out about ETI from this article will be disappointed. I claim to know some good questions about ETI but pre cious few answers. The best that can be done for some questions is to clas sify all possible answers and estimate the likelihood of having the correct answer in each category. What are the crucial questions? Asking the right question is some times remarkably important, and asking the wrong question can some times lead one far astray. I feel that this is just what is happening to those who are asking: What experiment or observation can we perform to be come aware of ETI? A better ques tion, in my view, is: Why are we un aware of ETI? A premise of most searches for advanced civilizations is that they are trying to communicate with us, but we are not quite clever enough to see or hear them. I suggest, instead, that if they had chosen to announce their presence to us, we would be aware. Since we are not, I presume they have not. The realm of science as a human ac tivity is quite limited and fairly pre cisely defined. Scientific hypotheses have consequences subject, at least in principle, to experimental or obser vational verification or falsification. Scientific questions have scientific hypotheses for answers. Hypotheses and questions outside the realm of science may be, instead, in the realm of philosophy or religion. As mankind progresses, the boundaries of science grow at the expense of philosophy and religion, which thus form the cutting edge of the endless effort to dispel ignorance. Some questions and hypotheses about ETI are on the borderline or outside the purview of science. The laboratory hypothesis, for example, would have us in an artificial labora tory situation; the stars and galaxies which we say we are studying are only spots on the wallpaper of our cage. The laws of physics, as we understand them, are unrelated to the real world outside. Clearly this hypothesis is unscientific, for it leads nowhere, it calls into question the premises on which it is based, and it makes no testable predictions. The laboratory hypothesis is indistinguishable from the hypothesis of god; science cannot deal with it. A civilization more advanced than mankind by a few eons might seem almost omnipotent and omniscient. Clarke's (1973) third law says, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Op erationally such a civilization would be equivalent to god. If our science predicts the existence of such civili zations, then we shall be forced to deal, somehow, with this religious hypothesis. The effort of science is to show that all the phenomena can be understood within science. Only if this effort were to fail would we be forced to hypoth esize something such as manipulation by ETI. For a scientist, this amounts to giving up. Evolution of civilizations What happens to advanced civiliza tions? How do they evolve? What is our own prognosis? We want to know, at least in broad outline, what a civi lization much older than ours might be like. Predicting our own develop ment for a few decades is difficult enough, but we want to know about other civilizations that may be older, not by decades but by eons. Figure 1 is an attempt to classify all possible answers to this question with specific reference to our own future. The ordinate, level of development, is to be defined in terms of complex ity, versatility, and ability to control the environment, either of the or ganism itself or of the civilization to which it belongs. This parameter in creases monotonically from inani mate objects, through viruses, sin gle-celled organisms, higher plants and animals, mankind, and beyond. Morrison (1973) argues that such a parameter should be defined in terms of the fraction of the free-energy content of a system contained in in ternal structural information. The key word is information. The differ ence between a rabbit and a rock is the information content, and the difference between a living and a dead rabbit is in the availability or usabil ity of the information. 1980 November-December 657</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. Development is illustrated for three planets, with several alternatives for the future of one of them. Hypothetical planet X is a marginal place for life to originate?too hot, too cold, too dry, or too something. Planet Y, by contrast, is almost ideal, and development has been so rapid that the civilization that origi nated on Y now controls the galaxy. (This fig ure was inspired by the figure on p. 26 of Sagan 1977, and is based on Fig. 1 in Ball 1973.) Civilizations advance to the extent that they accumulate new informa tion and knowledge and stagnate or regress to the extent that they fail to. I deliberately make no distinction between genetic information (in computer jargon, information stored in read-only memory) and cultural knowledge and information (stored in part in volatile read-write memory). Dawkins (1976) argues that the rules by which evolution occurs?mutation and natural selection through survival of the fittest?apply both to genes and m?mes, his term for the basic unit of cultural information. Bell (1976) argues that our civilization is on the brink of a new, postindustrial era, the information age, during which the preoccupation of mankind will be the acquisition and processing of knowledge and information. The word information is used in its broadest sense to include anything that can be expressed in symbols or words, arts or sciences. I suggest defining D, the level of de velopment, as the (common) loga rithm of the total information content (in bits) of the ecosystem. This in formation resides in genes, brains, and extrasomatic memories such as books and magnetic disks. One must carefully account for redundancy; two copies of the same gene or the same book are worth only a few bits more than one copy. This definition is based on the assumption that all nonredundant information is equally useful or valuable. This is not actually the case, of course (some information is wrong; some genes are lethal), and D, so defined, is only an approxima tion to an improved level-of-devel opment parameter to be defined by someone cleverer than I. There are three general categories of possibilities for the technological ev olution of civilizations: destruction (from within or without), technolog ical stagnation, and quasi-continuous technological progress. There are also mixed possibilities such as partial destruction and rebuilding and the surprisingly popular finite-lifetime idea. These possibilities are sketched in Figure 1 with specific reference to our own extrapolated future. Von Hoerner (1973) suggests that "we should assume a finite longevity L for the technical state of mind" if not for the longevity of the civilization. The opposite of this "technical state of mind" is what I have called techno logical stagnation, and certainly some civilizations do stagnate. I would argue that all civilizations may stag nate some of the time and some civi lizations may even stagnate all the time, but all civilizations don't stag nate all the time. Some fraction of the civilizations in the galaxy probably follow each of the possibilities in Figure 1. Analogy with the situation on Earth indicates, however, that most of those civiliza tions that are behind in technological development will eventually be en gulfed and destroyed, tamed, or per haps assimilated. Thus, generally speaking, we need consider only the most technologically advanced civi lizations because they will be, in some sense, in control of the galaxy. Mankind probably descended from Cambrian worms. But modern worms also descended from Cambrian worms. What happened? Well, some worms stagnated and some did not. My interest, however, lies in the most advanced life forms?those that did not stagnate; people are more inter esting than worms. The fabled little green men who plop down on the White House lawn and say, "Take me to your leader!" obviously agree, for this is said to a human rather than to some form of primitive ?arth life. My only hesitation is that interacting with civilizations only a little more advanced than we are, if any exist, may be easier than interacting with very advanced civilizations. Astronomy and astrophysics are based on the assumption that the laws of physics and chemistry, as we understand them, hold throughout the galaxy and the universe. To what 658 American Scientist, Volume 68</page><page sequence="4">extent this assumption is tested by experiments and observations is a subject of continuing debate. But if, as some of us believe, the laws of biology are ultimately based on the laws of physics and chemistry, then we might suppose that at least some of the laws of biology, as we under stand them, also hold throughout the galaxy and the universe. This geo morphism, like anthropomorphism, is sometimes justifiable, sometimes just wrong. But some of the argu ments for some of the laws of biology are, if correct, then universal. Among candidates for universal biological laws are, first, the most fundamental law of all?mutation and natural se lection through survival of the fit test?and also sexual reproduction, speciation, and intraspecific compe tition (territoriality and aggres sion). In the saga of life on Earth, the most significant events are probably the invention of DNA as a way to store and use information; the invention of sexual reproduction, which retains diversity in populations in spite of selection pressure and thus makes possible rapid shifts in response to environmental changes; the invention of individual memory, which makes learning possible; the invention of tools to multiply abilities and per ceptions; and the invention of genetic engineering, which makes random mutations unnecessary and which should speed evolution manyfold. As with most inventions, genetic engi neering, the most important advance of the century, can be used for either good or evil, by either design or acci dent. Mankind has a marvelous new opportunity and an awesome new responsibility. Some 400 million years ago our an cestors crawled out of the sea on un steady fins and established habitats in the hostile and forbidding world of dry land. Some of their aquatic rela tives must have thought this experi ment senseless, but today the land teems with life, descendants of fish. Now some of us are contemplating blasting ourselves off Earth on un steady rockets and establishing hab itats in the hostile and forbidding world of space. Some of our terrestrial relatives think this experiment senseless, but I predict that in only a century or two the solar system, at least, will teem with life?our de scendants. There are numerous bio logical niches, presumably unfilled, in space. Some of them will be filled by mankind. Destruction, however, is a possibility. We now have the ability to destroy our civilization if not our species. Global war would set us back a cen tury or two, maybe more. But there is another even more chilling possibili ty. In connection with the develop ment of atomic weapons during the 1950s, Ulam (1976) calculated that a hydrogen bomb exploded in the earth's atmosphere would cause a chain reaction in all the air physically in contact with the bomb. This cal culation was wrong, as Ulam himself quickly discovered; but if it had been correct, it would have shown a way to destroy mankind and the earth. If there is some such possibility, yet undiscovered, that might be used to destroy the earth, then destruction seems likely, sooner or later, whether by design or accident. If such an ac cident is not just likely, but somehow inevitable, then there may be no ETI. Species become extinct for a variety of reasons but usually through com petition with another species for the same niche in the environment or through an environmental change that eliminates their niche. Species neither die of old age nor commit suicide. At the present time an up heaval that destroys Earth would also destroy mankind, but in a century or so even this will no longer be true, provided that we have established other habitats throughout the solar system. There is no reason to suppose that mankind will ever cease to exist except perhaps in the sense that our progeny may evolve so far away from us as to constitute a new species. And they might keep a few human beings in a museum. Versatility and adaptability are in trinsically desirable even if one can not foresee a specific need. This is equally true for an individual organ ism, a company or institution, a species, or a civilization. Mankind is the most versatile and adaptable en tity that we know of. Much of man kind's evolution, the evolution of in telligence, can be understood in terms of increasing versatility and adapt ability. Man is the archetypical gen eralist and omnivore. Protoman began to lose his fur when he invented clothing, for clothing is more versatile than fur. Only man can adapt to changing conditions just by changing clothes. Men, suitably clothed, have lived and worked on the rrioon. No other living things (that we know of) can survive in so many diverse envi ronments. Thus I am very optimistic about the survival potential of mankind and, by analogy, of other civilizations. The problems of the moment?overpo pulation; depletion of natural re sources, especially energy; global war?will be solved or circumvented in a century, and mankind will be struggling with new problems, which will seem as serious then as ours do now. But the problems that I can foresee threaten neither the existence of our species nor our continued technological progress. I hazard to make the following pre dictions about our future and, by analogy, about the present state of ETI: 1. Acquiring and processing knowl edge and information will preoccupy advanced civilizations. As Bell (1976) reminds us, mankind is already on the brink of a postindustrial society?the information age. Clarke (1973) says, "In the long run the only human ac tivities really worthwhile are the search for knowledge, and the cre ation of beauty. This is beyond argu ment; the only point of debate is which comes first." 2. The trend to higher intelligence (information-processing ability) will continue. Advanced organisms will contain more brain compared with everything else, and brains will be come more efficient?more intelli gence per cm3 or per gram. 3. Planned engineering will replace accidental mutation as the dominant mode of evolution for both genes and ideas. The pace of progress will thereby quicken. 4. The distinctions among (1) ma chines (vehicles, robots, computers, etc.), (2) domesticated plants and animals, and (3) people will blur or disappear. Advanced societies will contain organisms, some special purpose, some general purpose, comprising engineered versions of all three. 5. Advanced organisms will operate 1980 November-December 659</page><page sequence="5">at low (internal) temperatures. Thermal agitation represents noise to be avoided. Life may need to originate in a liquid-water environment near 300? K to allow complex organic chemistry, but an engineered organ ism can be more efficient in its use of space and resources by operating at cryogenic temperatures. 6. The speed of light, as an upper limit on the speed of information flow, will force advanced civilizations to decentralize and duplicate certain functions to reduce waiting for in formation exchange. In our fastest computers we are already limited to some extent by light travel times. This will provide a strong incentive to reduce the size of brains. Habitats separated by interstellar distances will be largely independent. Cultural evolution may be thereby pro moted. 7. Energy and material requirements will be modest (even by our present standards) and free energy will be generated as needed (from hydrogen fusion, for example). Planets and stars will therefore be unnecessary and even undesirable as habitats. An Earthlike planet is a good place for ETI to be from, but not at. The planet of origin may become a museum. These predictions are conservative in the sense that they require no new physical principles. Number 6, in deed, is based on the assumption that no new physics, waiting to be discov ered, will allow us to circumvent the limitation of the speed of light. New discoveries will be made, of course, and the effects will probably be even more outlandish than my predictions. Clarke (1973) says, "The one fact about the future of which we can be certain is that it will be utterly fan tastic." Relationship of mankind with ETI The human mind presented with difficult new concepts and problems usually needs to work with an analogy based on experience. Electromagnetic radiation, for example, is something like a particle and something like a wave but is really neither particle nor wave. Thus we might be able to say that our relationship with ETI is similar to some other relationship that we understand. I suggest that we try the following analogy: the rela tionship of mankind with ETI is similar to the relationship of some form of primitive Earth life (PEL) with mankind. But which PEL? And how useful is this analogy? Let us begin by trying to guess how much more advanced than we are ETI might be. The level-of-develop ment parameter described in con nection with Figure 1 can be ex pressed in years (or some other unit of time) if we use a standard rate of de velopment?say, our own average rate?to convert units. Then a lifeless planet, such as Mars appears to be, could be said to be some 4.5 X 109 years behind us in development, notwithstanding that Mars and Earth are probably about the same chro nological age and that Mars, left to itself, would probably never develop life. If steady-state cosmology were true, then there should be, somewhere, infinitely old civilizations. We now believe, instead, that the universe is only two or three times as old as Earth. Recent estimates are some 5 X 109 years-for the age of Earth and 10 to 15 X 109 years for the age of the galaxy and the universe. From our standpoint, however, a civilization that is two or three times as old as we are is equivalent to a civilization that is infinitely old. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistin guishable from magic." Figure 2. One interpretation of the assumption of mediocrity is that the distribution function for ecosystems in the galaxy peaks at our de velopment age. The distribution function for stellar ages, however, seems to peak at an age younger than the sun's. This is compatible with the assumption of mediocrity if our develop ment rate has been slower than average or if the distribution is skewed such that we lie at the median but not the peak. We would like to know whether there is anybody out there with whom we might hope to talk?someone not more than, say, a few millennia ahead of us. Von Hoerner (1973) suggests dealing with such questions by using an assumption of mediocrity: "Nothing is unique, and most prob ably we are about average." Thus I imagine that mankind is at the peak or maybe the median of a quasi-bell shaped distribution of civiliza tions?more accurately ecosys tems?with half more advanced than we are, and half less advanced. Plac ing ourselves at the peak maximizes the number of neighbors that we have to talk with, but alas, this doesn't help, for the distribution is almost certainly too wide. Figure 2 illustrates the situation. D is the development age in years. Our development age is taken to be 5 X 109 years and the age of the galaxy 1010 years. There might be, however, civilizations with D greater than 1010 years if their average development rate has been faster than ours. JP is the number of ecosystems per galaxy per unit of D. The width W of this dis tribution cannot be much more than 1010 years and is unlikely to be less than about a hundredth of this, 108 years, without making us unusual and special contrary to the spirit of our assumption of mediocrity. The area under this curve, the total number of ecosystems in the galaxy, might be as small as one, but I am inclined to guess at least 109, which is some 0.1% of the number of stars in the galaxy. Similar estimates were made by Shklovskii and Sagan (1966) and by Von Hoerner in Cameron (1963); see also Dole (1970). I suggest below that civilizations only slightly more advanced than we are must interact with each other in some way. This presumably has some effect on the shape of the curve in Figure 2, but I'm not clever enough to under stand what this effect might be. Table 1 shows the consequences of various assumptions about W. A is the development age of a typical ETI civilization that falls at half ampli tude on the distribution above us. Rather than typical ETI, I suggested above that we should consider the most advanced ETI?the upper tail of the distribution in Figure 2?but the results are already startling enough. The next column in Table 1 660 American Scientist, Volume 68</page><page sequence="6">gives the geological time (in years before the present) at which the dominant PEL fits into the analogy to relate to us as we relate to this typical ETI. Then the corresponding geo logical division and highest PEL are listed. The next column, labeled /, shows the average distance in parsecs between civilizations no more than a millennium ahead of us, on the as sumption that the galaxy contains 109 ecosystems uniformly distributed over a disk 30 kiloparsecs in diam eter. Now I can imagine talking with mammals and birds, indeed I've done it, although the conversation was on a pretty low intellectual level. But oysters? The point is that if this analogy is good for anything, then our relationship with ETI is probably nothing like the relationship of a primitive human tribe with techno logical man, which analogy seems to be in the minds of many who propose ETI searches, but instead is more like the relationship of an animal?a rather primitive animal?with man kind. The idea that we shall be wel comed as new members into the ga lactic community is as unlikely as the idea that oysters will be welcomed as new members into the human com munity. We're probably not even edible. Is the degree of control exerted by the most advanced ETI over the galaxy more than, comparable to, or less than the degree of control exerted by mankind over Earth? That we are unaware of ETI is certainly relevant to this question. But another com monplace fact might be equally rele vant: the galaxy and the universe appear to be in extreme thermody namic disequilibrium. The sky is still (almost) dark at night 150 years after Olbers. Unless our understanding of astrophysics is seriously flawed, pro digious quantities of free energy are going to waste. This means that we are observing a natural process? nature is arbitrarily wasteful?rather than an engineered process, provided that ETI values free energy as we do. Kardashev (1964) defined three levels of advanced civilizations: a type-I civilization controls the resources of a planet, a type-II civilization controls the resources of a star, and a type-Ill civilization controls the resources of a galaxy. Mankind is fast approaching Table 1. The effect of various assumptions about the width of the number-density distri bution (Win Fig. 2) PEL dominance Geological W {yrs) A ( 109 yrs) Years B.P. epoch PEL I (parsecs) Comments 1010 10 2.5 X 109 Precambrian algae? 2,700 Probably impossible 109 5.5 4.5 X 108 Ordovician mollusks, 840 Likely trilobites 108 5.05 5 X 107 Eocene mammals, 270 Somewhat unlikely birds 107 5.005 5 X 106 Pliocene protoman 84 Very unlikely type-I status. Although there may be some of Kardashev's type-I and type-II civilizations, we infer that there is no type-Ill civilization, at least in our galaxy. This argument is, alas, probably wrong. An assumption already con tained in Kardashev's definitions is that advanced civilizations will need or want to control the largest possible energy and material resources. I have even changed the definitions slightly; Kardashev referred to "energy con sumption," rather than control of resources, as if energy consumption is equivalent to level of development. If knowledge is the thing of great value, rather than matter and energy, then there may be no reason for grandiose engineering manipulation. If free energy is of little value, then there is little incentive to prevent its natural draining away. Where is everybody? The most interesting scientific problem of our age involves the question of the existence of ETI. Why are we unaware of ETI? I believe that this will become the most important and fruitful question about ETI. I suggest classifying most of the possi ble answers into five categories: 1. There is no ETI. We are either unique?the only ecosystem?or first in level of development. Hart (1975) presented careful arguments for this view. As discussed above, I regard this answer as unlikely because we seem to lack any special situation that would make us singular or outstanding. This answer must be regarded, neverthe less, as a possibility. Finding planets around other stars and understanding the origin of life from nonliving ma terial would strengthen the argu ments in favor of the assumption of mediocrity and against our singu larity. 2. ETI is trying to talk to us or at least attract our attention, but we are not yet clever enough to hear or un derstand. This answer is, surprisingly, the popular view. The shortcomings in most arguments for this answer involve attributing to ETI lesser capabilities than are in our own ex trapolated future. The hypothetical ETI with whom we are to communi cate seems to be just a few decades ahead of us?sometimes not even that. But even with generous as sumptions, the probability that there is such a civilization anywhere in the galaxy is vanishingly small. 3. Advanced civilizations don't know that we're here. But the sun, the solar system, Earth, and mankind are all conspicuous; there is no way to hide. We (mankind) shall certainly start cataloging and studying ecosystems in the galaxy as soon as we are able; why should ETI do less? 4. Advanced civilizations know that we're here but they don't care; they're ignoring us. We pose no threat and we have nothing that they want. This is a likely answer. If the assumption of mediocrity is correct, then we are average, ordinary, and perhaps un interesting. Should this answer prove to be true, it would deal another blow to our anthropocentric ego. 5. Advanced civilizations are dis creetly and inconspicuously watching us but are not dabbling. This is the zoo hypothesis (Ball 1973). As Kuiper 1980 November-December 661</page><page sequence="7">and Morris (1977) point out, our cul ture may be our only resource of value to ETI: Complete contact with a superior civili zation (in which their store of knowledge is made available to us) would abort [our] further development.... By intervening in our natural progress now, members of an extraterrestrial society could easily extinguish the only resource on this planet that could be of any value to them .... To establish that avoidance of open contact is not the most likely alien behavior, one would need to identify a resource that does not fall into this category. There are many versions of the zoo hypothesis and some of them predate my 1973 paper. Eiseley (1957) says: Yet whenever I see a frog's eye low in the water warily ogling the shoreward land scape, I always think inconsequentially of those twiddling mechanical eyes that mankind manipulates nightly from a thousand observatories. Someday ... we are going to see something not to our lik ing, some looming shape outside there across the great pond of space. Whenever I catch a frog's eye ... I stand quite still and try hard not to move or lift a hand since it would only frighten him. And standing thus it finally comes to me that this is the most enormous extension of vision of which life is capable: the pro jection of itself into other lives. But then, like the oracle who does not understand his own words, Eiseley adds, "This is the lonely, magnificent power of humanity." To be charita ble, we might assume that he meant to say, "on Earth." This classification of answers is in complete; I have omitted, in particu lar, the laboratory hypothesis as un scientific. These answers are also incomplete in another sense; the gal axy may contain an assortment of civilizations at various levels of de velopment, as suggested in Figure 2, and we would need to ask why we are unaware of each. Alternatively, as Bracewell (1974) suggests, there may be a "galactic club" of interacting civilizations. Or, more likely in my view, the civilization that is number one exercises control and enforces the rules. They may keep us separate from our neighbors to prevent unfa vorable or disastrous interaction. The present epoch on Earth is sin gular at least in this respect: if we (mankind) are subjected to no con straints, then we shall take over the galaxy in a relatively short time, say a few hundred thousand years. But if another more advanced civilization already exercises control, then we shall be stopped, somehow, in the endeavor, and in being stopped we shall probably become aware of this ETI. We cannot be kept in a zoo for ever without becoming at least dimly aware of our predicament. Dawkins (1976) suggests that a mile stone in history was passed when we became aware of genetic evolution and so the "why" of our own exis tence. Another milestone, perhaps more important, will be passed, probably in our near future, when we become aware of our status with re spect to ETI. Eavesdropping Categories 3 and 4 above allow the possibility of becoming aware of ETI by eavesdropping?that is, we might be able to observe advanced civiliza tions as they go about their business, whatever that is. Eavesdropping means intercepting some of their stray energy or information and cor rectly interpreting it as being from ETI rather than a natural process. We need not decode the signal, but we must determine, somehow, that it is a signal. Eavesdropping is, unfortunately, fiendishly difficult even if they make no effort at concealment. Although they may control an astronomical quantity of energy, they probably control it well, which means that they waste little of it. But their waste en ergy is what we might hope to detect. Consider an example from recent history. Our first television trans mitters used antennas that were nearly omnidirectional; much of the signal power went up and away from Earth. But since our TV broadcasters are unaware of any viewers out there, they began using more sophisticated antennas with pancake-shaped beams to direct the signal to their viewers on Earth. Less signal power is thereby lost in space. Sullivan and co-workers (1978) discuss our TV broadcasts as a source of information for ETI. The point here is that the more sophisti cated we become, the less signal power we waste. Even if we catch some energy lost by ETI, we might not understand what we have. Everyone tries to interpret each new astronomical discovery as a natural process; so far we have suc ceeded. Information theory shows that the more sophisticated a modu lation scheme becomes, the more like noise it appears to naive would-be eavesdroppers. TV again gives an example. Our TV signals are ex tremely un-noiselike, what with sync pulses and redundancy?each frame is much like the last. Eavesdroppers would easily discern the unnatural origin of our TV. But imagine the next generation: both transmitter and receiver know the time, which elimi nates the need for sync pulses. The receiver stores information in a memory so that the transmitter needs to send only changes as they occur in the picture. Even with no additional sophistication, this gives a noiselike signal; eavesdroppers have a tougher job. Eavesdropping is fiendishly difficult, perhaps even more difficult than getting money from Congress to build a widget to try to eavesdrop with. Rumor is, however, that they give money to the CIA for such pur poses. So what should we make of all this? I suggest as working hypotheses that: (1) Mankind is neither alone nor number one. Advanced civilizations exist and exert some degree of control over the galaxy and universe. (2) They are aware of us at least at some level. (But are they concerned with us? We may be only an obscure entry in their tabulation of inhabited re gions of the galaxy.) (3) We are un aware of them because either (a) they want us to be unaware; they are hid ing. (But this means that they care about us, else why bother to hide?) Or (b) we are not (yet) clever enough to know that they are there, but they do not care whether we know. These two subdivisions of (3) hinge on the value of our civilization to them. I am in clined to an intermediate position: our ecosystem and culture are of some interest; Earth is worth studying at least by a few of their scientists, but the faun on their street has never heard of us and does not care to. To conclude, I can do no better than quote Dyson (1972), who suggests that "a reasonable long-range pro gram of searching for evidence of in telligence in the galaxy is indistin guishable from a reasonable long range program of general astronomi cal exploration." I would add that 662 American Scientist, Volume 68</page><page sequence="8">biological exploration, especially searching for understanding of the origin of life on Earth, is equally im portant.
