<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND PERSONALITY A reply to Professor WVieman JOHN WRIGHT BUCKHAM Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, California HE criticism which Professor Wieman has made of my article on John Dewey's conception of religion' indi- cates the need of further clarification of my position; and since the Editor of the Journal has generously given me space for this purpose I am glad to avail myself of the oppor- tunity to state my point of view more fully. I First, let me clarify my position as to the nature of religion itself. The study of religious experience has led me to believe that it is so essentially and pervasively human as to be found, in widely differing forms and degrees, not only in primitive and historic cultures but even in our own religiously sterile age and civilization-and that far more rootedly and extensively than appears in consciously cherished and organized religious activity and worship. The best expression of this deep seated and per- vasive attitude of the human spirit seems to me to be, as I have stated, "the sense of the sacred," or the spirit of reverence. As illustrative of half-conscious religious sentiment I have instanced the devoted artist, the dedicated scientist, and the true lover. That such forms of reverential devotion are but fragmentary and do not constitute adequate religion must be apparent, without further argument. Perhaps it would be truer to say that one who reverences science, or art, or his social group, or his beloved, is to that extent religious (revising Mr. Dewey's use of the term) rather than that he has a religion. That such reverence and devotion carries with it, however, The Journal of Religion, January, I935. 309</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION some degree of "controlling loyalty" would seem to go without saying. That this loyalty would be "ruled out" of my concep- tion is a singular inference. Loyalty, I assume to be, a criterion of the religious reality and worth of any form of devotion. The religious experience, subjected to scrutiny, discloses emotional, cognitive, and volitional elements. In terming it an experience characterized by the sense of sacredness the emotion- al factor is assigned a hitherto insufficiently recognized but by no means exclusive place in it. To make emotion the sole con- tent of religion would be psychological ineptitude. It would dis- regard that volitional element, or "faith," which, with the intui- tive cognition necessary to it, gives the religious experience its vitality. II As to the function of imagination in religion-upon which Mr. Wieman, following Mr. Dewey, lays so much emphasis- too much can hardly be made of its potency and value. To "put in its place" either the will-to-believe, or intuition, or emotion, or all of these together, would be to leave religion gray and impotent. Imagination gives vividness and color to the religious experience. It is the creator of symbolism, the artist of the soul. To assign to imagination, however, "the use of concepts" (un- less by concepts is meant images) is to deprive it of its distinc- tive character. It seems to me truer to include imagination, together with intuition and intellection within reason as a whole-reason thus playing an active part in religious expe- rience itself, and at the same time constituting the tribunal to which religion must submit its claims. III The answer to the question whether Professor Dewey's con- ception of religion as outlined in Our Common Faith is consonant with Pragmatism, depends upon how Pragmatism is defined. Mr. Wieman regards Pragmatism as standing for "the possibili- ties of value"-and hence regards ideals, as such, as of its very 3Io</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND PERSONALITY essence. This is a very idealistic interpretation of Pragmatism- whose watchwords have been actualities, instrumentalities, con- sequences, rather than ideal values. Professor Dewey has made a very forcible pragmatic judg- ment of ideals in his well-known book Human Nature and Con- duct, in which he writes as follows: .... It is supposed that the thought of the ideal is necessary to arouse dissatisfaction with the present and to arouse effort to change it. But in reality the ideal is itself the product of discontent with conditions. In- stead however of serving to organize and direct effort, it operates as a compensatory dream. It becomes another ready-made world. Instead of promoting effort at concrete transformations of what exists, it constitutes another kind of existence already somewhere in being. It is a refuge, an asylum from effort. Thus the energy that might be spent in transforming present ills goes into oscillating flights into a far away perfect world and the tedium of enforced returns into the necessities of the present evil world. We can recover the genuine import of ideals and idealism only by disentangling this unreal mixture of thought and emotion.2 These and similar indictments directed against abuses of the ideal are purifying and wholesome. Nevertheless he who wrote them owed the amends to the Ideal which he has now made. Pragmatism has made a much needed contribution to philoso- phy, through William James and John Dewey, but Pragmatism was never sufficient to fill Dewey's horizon3 and he has now definitely evaluated it by transcending it, thus giving to it its real but subordinate place in a comprehensive philosophical outlook. Such, at least, is my view of Pragmatism. And let me interject here that I find much more in common with John Dewey than may appear in my criticism of his philos- ophy of religion. We two are of kin and were academically nur- tured on the self-same hill at the feet of that high-souled phil- osophical idealist, Professor H. A. P. Torrey.4 If I have fol- 2 Chap. viii. 3Nor that of James either. 4Dewey has paid a well-deserved tribute to Professor Torrey in Contemporary American Philosophy, Vol. II. 3II</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION lowed more closely, but not I trust blindly or too closely, the path of orthodoxy than my honored fellow-student, I should be untrue both to philosophy and religion not to recognize the wide-ranging and inestimable service he has given, in great sincerity, to each of these essential human interests.5 IV The central issue raised by Mr. Dewey's reinterpretation of religion is, as Mr. Wieman affirms, the conception of God ad- equate for a religion of loyalty to ideals. To both Dewey and Wieman God is an activity-to Dewey "the active relation between ideal and actual," to Wieman, an activity that is "in nature" but "transcends" nature. This ac- tivity the latter further defines as "a unifying creative interac- tion which makes the activities of things and persons mutually sustaining and mutually meaningful." The foregoing statements of both of these interpreters of religion seem to me to be freshly conceived expressions of that activity which Christian theology, from its inception, has con- ceived as the Divine Immailence. Theology has consistently held that such activity is not self-generated, nor generated by Nature, but that it is the immanent activity of a Being who can be thus actively immanent only as He is also transcendent. This principle seems to me irrefutable.6 Each of these thinkers moves unwittingly in the direction of transcendence, Dewey by describing the relation between the ideal and the actual as active-for when a relation becomes ac- 5 Professor Dewey has permitted me to quote the following words from a personal letter regarding my article in the Journal of Religion: "I hardly need say that I found your article wholly free from odium theologicum and given the different standpoints, really appreciative of what I was trying to say. Indeed, most of the comments that have come to me from those connected with the churches have been free from bitter- ness and generous in tone-which I think a good omen for the future, whatever the intellectual disagreements may continue to be. I won't try to go into the intellectual problems raised by our particular difference, but I do want to assure you .... that I welcome your contributions to a theme of such great importance." 6 Let me refer again to my article, "Transcendence-Immanence," Journal of Phi- losophy, April 9, I931. 312</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND PERSONALITY tive it is more than a mere relation (relations are not active unless one, or both, of the relata is active)-and Wieman by using that wholly supernatural, non-pragmatic and personal term, transcends. To be immanent it is necessary to be also transcendent; and that which is both immanent and transcend- ent cannot be other than personal. V This prompts me to attempt to define what may be called "The New Supernaturalism," which may well replace the older Supernaturalism against which Dewey-in company with mod- ern theologians, as well as scientists and philosophers in gener- al-rightly inveighs. The term "Nature," as inherited from Stoic ethics, and incorporated into eighteenth-century Rational- ism, and thence into much current philosophical and general usage, is practically equivalent to "Reason." Nature, properly speaking, manifests a Reason (Logos) immanent in her, but not her own. Reason is still man's distinctive trait in spite of all attempts to despoil him of it, and its possession makes him, accurately evaluated, supranatural, i.e., a member of a rational- moral-spiritual order, as well as of the natural order. That he has attained this level in the process of emergent evolution does not at all affect the quality of his higher life as essentially supranatural. This does not mean that man is any the less embedded in Nature, psycho-physically, wrought out of her very bone and tissue. Rather does this kinship with Nature reveal its real sig- nificance only in the light of his higher nature. That within man which is above Nature cannot have its original source and in- terpretation in Nature alone, although Nature is the medium through and by which man the person has won his divine birth- right. This view of the relation of man to Nature (as was pointed out in my previous article) manifestly joins issue with that of Dr. Dewey. For to him the ultimate reality is Nature-expe- 313</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION rience (presumably including religious experience) being "the progressive disclosure of nature itself." This theory of Nature as the Ultimate I hold to be inadequate. Whitehead's "Ulti- mate Category" Creativity, comes much nearer to adequacy, but Creativity can be creative only as it embodies purpose. And Creative Purpose cannot mean less than Creative Person. VI This leads to the final issue involved in the discussion-the nature and meaning of Personality. This is too large a subject to be more than touched upon here.7 The conception of per- sonality which Professor Wieman holds is indicated in the sentence, "How can God do all this (i.e., integrating and value- making) and still be bound down to the kind of functioning which is essential to a personality?" To this I would reply: How can He do all this without the infinite freedom and capacity inher- ent alone in personality? It is strange how restricted and inadequate a conception prevails, not only in the popular mind but in scientific circles and large areas of philosophy itself, of the essential nature of personality. Identified with physical form and individual idio- syncrasies as regards man, and with a crude supernaturalism and a cruder anthropomorphism as regards God, personality is looked upon as a sentimental and artificial fetish-impossible as interpretative of man and naive and outgrown as applied to God. On the contrary personality, in its larger meaning, is an inescap- able and profoundly significant reality of human experience, containing comparatively unexplored and inexhaustible ethical, philosophical, and religious meaning and value, the study of which has been neglected by a generation bound down by con- ventional, superficial, psychological, and matter-of-fact notions inherited from positivistic materialistic absorption in things- the knowledge of which has enjoyed almost exclusive attention, 7 Reference may be made to my volumes, Personality and the Christian Ideal (I909), Personality and Psychology (I924), and The Humanity of God (1928). 3I4</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND PERSONALITY withdrawing it from "the proper study of mankind": man as man. These traditional inhibitions which have stood in the way of a better understanding of personality have been augmented by the dominance of the widely prevalent Naturalism unwarrant- ably deduced from modern science. But there are clear indica- tions that this restricted notion of personality is giving place to a determined endeavor to probe more deeply into its nature and meaning. The profound and penetrative study of consciousness, originating with the Viennese school of Brentano, developing into the Logical Phenomenology of Husserl and interpreted in its ethical and social meaning by the late Max Scheler, and by Nicolai Hartmann, and others; the renascence of Intuitionism in France signalized by the recent volumes of Bergson and Edouard LeRoy; the resurgence of Personal Idealism in Great Britain as represented by the late Ellis McTaggart and by William Temple, C. C. J. Webb, Hilda Oakley, and others; and the emphasis upon Valuism and Personalism in America all indicate that both philosophy and theology are moving toward a profounder knowledge of personality and its meaning. The further understanding of personality, as it unfolds, promises a synthesis of empiricism, realism and idealism in a Philosophy of Religion which, starting from experience, moves rationally, as well as experientially, toward that enlarging Per- sonal Theism which alone is adequate to interpret and imple- ment the creative religious values, so essential (as Professors Dewey and Wieman affirm) to the higher life of humanity. 3I5</page></plain_text>
