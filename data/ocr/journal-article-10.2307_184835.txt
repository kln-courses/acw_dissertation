<plain_text><page sequence="1">Symbolism in Science and Philosophy BY WILBUR M. URBAN H@ 7; 4 S METAPHYSICS possible? From the begin- ning of our present sophisticated era we have continually been compelled to ask this question. For myself I confess to a growing impatience with this and like questions. I hold with Kant that metaphysics is a Naturanlage, that should all science pass away and should we revert to barbarism, there would still be metaphysics. I am also disposed to think that should mankind develop in the opposite direction, should we become the supermen or the angels which the perfectionists of all times have envisaged, metaphysics would not only remain, but metaphysical insight would be the very life of that perfection. As Dante said, "metaphysics is the bread of angels." Still less am I impressed with a recent fashionable way of asking the same question, namely, are metaphysical propositions meaningful? This is just as silly a question as the first. Even the logical positivist, when he asserts that metaphysical assertions are meaningless, and proposes to show that they are so by logical analysis, is careful, as in the case of Carnap, to say that they are not meaningless in every sense, but only in some special sense which he believes he is justified in making normative. Even when he calls metaphysics nonsense, he is careful, with Wittgen- stein, to call it "important nonsense." It is true, of course, that "a little nonsense now and then is relished by the best of 276</page><page sequence="2">W. M. Urban 277 men," but this is the first time, to my knowledge at least, that in the long story of human vagaries and absurdities, the words nonsense and important have been brought together. Surely this is the last stage in sophistication! WHAT IS METAPHYSICS? What then is this thing, metaphysics, of which we allow our selves to say such extraordinary things? Irn attempting to answer this question it seems to me to be all important that we should start with it in its aspect of Naturanlage-that we should recog- nize that, like the prose of the famous play, everybody is talking metaphysics withoute knowing it. In Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman, Don Juan is trying to get over to the man and the woman and to the perverse Devil himself, his understanding of life and of the universe in which that life is lived. "Life," he cries, "was driving at brains, at its darling object and organ by which it can attain, not only self- consciousness but self-understanding." "This is metaphysics, Juan," retorts the Senior Commander, and he was right in his retort. Juan is here talking metaphysics, as we all are whenever we use such terms as "life" the "world" the "universe," and whenever we attribute to them qualities or activities or ascribe to them ultimate origins or ends. In all such talk we are trench- ing on the metaphysical and are using metaphysical language. The first character of metaphysics and metaphysical language is, then, that it makes statements about met-empirical objects- such as life, the world, the cosmos-things which themselves are not immediately experienced but are in some fashion the neces- sary coimplicates of experience and of its expression. But there is a second and equally important character of all these objects of metaphysical discourse. They are not only met-empirical, in the sense defined, but they are always of the nature of "wholes"- either partial or total. It is precisely when we talk about wholes of any kind, whether in science or philosophy, that we trench on the metaphysical. Metaphysics is then, the name we give to all those processes of thought by which we seek to round out our experience. We may</page><page sequence="3">278 Symbolism also say, with Kemp-Smith that, "it is legitimate, because only as metaphysically oriented is the human type of consciousness possible at all. Only by transcending the immediate can we apprehend the immediate." For our present purposes, I should prefer to put it this way. Only by talking about metaphysical objects can we talk intelligently about the physical. As well ask a man to whistle and smile at the same time, as to talk meaning- fully about the immediate without transcending it. It is the meaningfulness of this discourse that the logical positivist denies, for it contains propositions that are not verifiable empirically. Kant, of course, never denied its meaningfulness. He held, indeed, that certain metaphysical propositions about the world or cosmos, the soul, and God are empirically unverifiable. But Kant was too good a philosopher to call them meaningless. For he knew that they constituted in many ways the most significant parts of human discourse, and a large part of his effort consisted in showing just wherein the significance and truth consisted. SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS: IF SCIENCE IS POSSIBLE, METAPHYSICS IS POSSIBLE The significance of Kant's question-is metaphysics possible?- lay in the fact that he assumed the reality or truth of science. On the basis of that assumption he had a norm for the testing of the possibility of metaphysics. The situation is, mutatis mutandis, the same today. Under- lying all the arguments of the anti-metaphysicians is the assump- tion that we have knowledge-in the sense of science-and this in turn becomes the norm or criterion by which the claims of any other type of supposed knowledge are tested. The important consideration here is the change in our conception of science since Kant's day; what we may, perhaps, call the new scientific epistem- ology. In the first place, the conception of science has changed in the sense that, as it is frequently said, science itself has become meta- physical. In the second place, we have a change in our con- ception of science and scientific knowledge, since the days of Newton and Kant, in the fact that a large part of science is recog-</page><page sequence="4">W. M. Urban 279 nized by the scientist himself as symbolic. It is true that Kant specifically recognized the element of symbolism in science, but in the main he assumed the literal character of scientific concepts and on this assumption was alone able, as Bergson points out, to achieve his chief results in the critique of metaphysics. I shall take up the metaphysical character of modern science first and pass from this to the conception of symbolism as a scien- tific principle. MODERN SCIENCE AS METAPHYSICAL It is frequently asserted that precisely at the moment when the antimetaphysical tendency in philosophy is being revived, the world of science has become increasingly metaphysical. This is undoubtedly true and it is a significant fact that the most severe critics of positivism are to be found among the most distinguished physicists of the day. Now I do not mean of course that science has not always been metaphysical. When Newton cried, "physics, beware meta- physics," it was because he did not realize that he himself was talking metaphysics. The universal mechanism of the Newton- ian physics was itself a metaphysics. What I do mean, is, that modern science is becoming conscious that it is talking meta- physics and acknowledges it. Now that a large part of science-and that the most interesting and significant (I had almost said the only interesting and sig- nificant) consists in metaphysical propositions in the sense de- fined, becomes clear on the most cursory examination. All the special sciences claim to make propositions about wholes which themselves can never be known in the sense of the empirical criterion of knowledge of the new positivist. This is, of course, particularly true of the historical sciences in the wide sense, the sciences of life and of peoples. It is said that you can not indict a whole people, but that is what we find ourselves doing over and over again. We find our- selves in peculiar embarrassment whenever we try not to. Be that as it may, we can not talk history without talking about peoples as a whole, cultures and epochs, and, as Troeltsch in his</page><page sequence="5">280 Symbolism Historismus has pointed out, it is utterly impossible to have history without discourse about met-empirical wholes. It is a commonplace of present day methodology of history that the condition of historical judgments or propositions is the assump- tion of a completed series of events, although in the nature of the case no such completed series is empirically given. And this is true of natural history no less than of human. No theory of evolution can be constructed which does not contain such proposi- tions. The fundamental problems of biology are all metaphysical. But there are also generalizing sciences (to use Ricket's term), which make propositions about wholes. Their method enables them, they hold, to infer from a part, or a limited number of parts, that which holds for all parts, and therefore, for the whole. Physics, for example, has to do with the limitless, and to that extent inexhaustible, world of bodies. It claims to develop concepts which hold for every part of this world and, therefore, to that extent for the whole. This is even more evident in that part of physics which is his- torical, that part which claims to say something meaningful about the running down or building up of the physical universe. The second law of thermodynamics, which, as Bergson has rightly said, is the most metaphysical of all scientific laws, is so precisely because it is a historical proposition and, when applied to the physical cosmos, becomes a statement about a limitless, met- empirical whole. More of this later. It is of the utmost importance to be quite clear on this point. The individual sciences claim to make meaningful propositions about partial totalities only; metaphysics, however, about the totality of totalities, about reality as a whole. This is, to be sure, a real difference, one that dare not be ignored and which we shall find of significance in the sequel. But in principle the situation is the same in both cases. It is customary to say that metaphysics is impossible because the world whole is endless and cannot be known in its entirety. But this in itself proves nothing, for the same is true in the case of the partial totalities of the sciences, in regard to which no question is ordinarily raised. In principle the partial totalities of the particular sciences about which significant</page><page sequence="6">W. M. Urban 28 propositions are made, are as empirically unverifiable as the object of metaphysics. This indeterminate character of the material of science does not make striving towards knowledge of the whole illegitimate nor propositions about the whole meaning- less. In science, at least as ordinarily understood, indeterminacy and meaning are perfectly compatible. My conclusion then is, that if science is possible metaphysics is possible. The objections against the possibility of metaphysics can be brought equally against science unless we take a truncated view of science which conceives it as very much less than it is ordinarily held to be. But I go even further. I should say that science is possible only if metaphysics is possible. We have seen that one might just as well ask a man to whistle and smile at the same time as to talk about the things of experience without using notions of wholes, partial or total, which go beyond experience. We may now say the same thing of science. As well ask a physicist to whistle and smile at the same time as to talk intelli- gibly about physical objects without including notions of physical wholes. The truth of this we shall see even more clearly when we come to the problem of scientific symbolism. It is true that the positivists seek to escape this conclusion. Thus Carnap writes, "I will call metaphysical all those proposi- tions which claim to represent knowledge about something which is over and beyond all experience.... I do not include in met- aphysics those theories-sometimes called metaphysical-whose object is to arrange the most general propositions of the various regions of scientific knowledge in a well ordered system; such theories belong actually to the field of empirical science, not of philosophy, however daring they may be."' I do not believe that this distinction can be satisfactorily maintained, as I shall pres- ently show. The notion of a system of science is not separable from the notion of a whole of reality. Wherever that notion enters we have trenched on the metaphysical whether we know it or not. Either one has pure empiricism-and with it mere knowledge of parts (a collection), or one has systematic knowledge 1 Philosophy and Logical Syntax, p. 15.</page><page sequence="7">282 Symbolism and this always involves propositions about the whole. There is no middle ground, as Kant clearly saw. SYMBOLISM AS A SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE The question, is metaphysics possible, is significant only on the assumption that science is possible, for it is the latter knowledge that is taken as a criterion. It is my further contention that changes, since the days of Newton and Kant, in our views of the nature of scientific knowledge, have altered in a significant way the problem of metaphysical knowledge. This change is the recognition of the symbolic character of scientific knowledge. I suppose that it would be admitted that, culturally and philo- sophically speaking, few things are more significant about the science of our age than its own consciousness of its symbolic character. It is true that even Kant was enlightened enough to say that what is ordinarily thought of as examples of the pure understanding is to be reckoned mostly as examples of symbolic knowledge. But in the main, Kant proceeded on the assump- tions of the Newtonian science of his day, which thought of scientific concepts as literal rendering of reality. It was this assumption, never really criticised, which enabled him to criticise the symbolisms of metaphysics with such devastating power. Be that as it may, there is no question as to what has happened in modern science itself. The passage from the copy theory to the symbolic theory of scientific concepts is the outstanding development of the new epistemology in science. This move- ment began in physical science and has been carried out most fully there, but it has not been without its effect upon the other sciences also. Over and over again we are told by the physical scientists themselves that between what is called Newtonian science and that of the present there is in this respect a great gap. Sir William Thompson's idea of the understanding of a phenomenon of nature is constantly contrasted with the notion of the scientific concept as developed since Hertz. For the former to understand was to construct a mechanical model which should represent literally the happening in all its parts. For the latter to under-</page><page sequence="8">W. M. Urban 283 stand involves no such literal copy but a relation that is purely symbolic. This contrast of the symbol with the copy theory is a commonplace of present day scientific epistemology. The point which I wish to emphasize is that physics now works with what Becher calls impenetrable, that is intuitively unveri- fiable, hypotheses. In a sense, he points out, it has to a degree always worked in this way. Even Newtonian physics made use of the actio ad distans which seemed to some of Newton's contem- poraries, for instance Huygens, unintelligible. Nevertheless in classical physics theoretical constructions followed natural proc- esses into their geometrically intuited details. The fundamental mechanical concepts of force, inertia, etc., purport to be generali- zations and descriptions of concretely intuited phenomena. Since the middle of the Igth century the picture has gradually changed. The physics of the field of the Igth and 2oth centuries, from Faraday and Maxwell to the Relativity theory, presents in increasing degree, self authenticating formal systems which are not any longer in their details intuitively interpretable. This reaches its culmination in the completely unintuitable character of the Quantum theory, where even the relatively most concrete intuitive theory of Schroedinger already operates with vibration signs in many-dimensional space. In any case, one thing is clear. However, we may interpret and evaluate the notion, a large part of scientific knowledge is symbolic, and with the recognition of that fact must come a change in our conceptions of scientific knowledge which greatly changes the character of the philosophical problem since Kant's day. THEORIES OF SCIENTIFIC SYMBOLISM This, then, is what I understand by "symbolism as a scientific principle," namely that, paraphrasing Kant's statement, scientific concepts formerly reckoned as copies or models of reality, are now to be reckoned mostly as symbols and that scientific knowl- edge is, in large part at least, symbolic knowledge. There are various theories as to the range and nature of this symbolism. With regard to the nature of scientific symbols we have on the one hand, the operational, or as it is sometimes called,</page><page sequence="9">284 Symbolism the conventional theory of scientific concepts; on the other hand, what I may describe as relational or partial coincidence theories. A really careful treatment of this problem would involve the recognition of distinctions into which time will not permit me to go. I must be content to risk the dangers of over-simplification for the sake of brevity and clearness. In the case of the operational theory it is not necessary that the scientific concept or symbol shall be a "picture," shall cor- respond in any way to the realities referred to. All that is necessary is that we shall be able to operate with it. For the relational theory, to be a symbol the scientific concept need be a picture only in the sense that there is partial coincidence, namely, coincidence between relations in the nexus of the things pictured and relations in that part of appearance, or of our ex- perience, which stands for the objects. Thus from the logical point of view the problem of the notion of a "picture" as in the investigations of Wittgenstein, becomes basal for a theory of scientific knowledge. Various figures are used to illuminate this notion. We have that famous one of Bertrand Russell-of the musical score and the symphony- or Jeans' figure of the map. Perhaps we may take the latter as our best point of departure. In his recent Presidential address, Jeans discusses the relation of scientific concepts to the "wholes" of physics. He points out that "it is a reasonable requirement that a man should represent each bit of territory in its proper shape and its relatively proper size, that is, literally. But he points out that this apparently reasonable requirement can be fulfilled only when the map is of a very small part of the globe, as for instance, the County of Surrey. The larger the whole, the more symbolic the representa- tion. It turns out then, that the Newtonian mechanics was like the map of Surrey-good as far as it went, but not adequate for picturing the wholes with which physics is concerned. The in- conceivably great and the inconceivably small were equally beyond its ken."2 We shall presently take up the special problems involved in the 2 I'he New World Picture of Modern Physics, Nature, September 8, 1934.</page><page sequence="10">W. M. Urban 285 knowledge of the "wholes" of physics. For the moment we are concerned merely with the notion of symbolism as a scientific principle. It is, briefly, that the principle of literal representa- tion has only limited application-that the coincidence of rela- tions between the physical concept and its object is only partial and that the representation is merely symbolic. There are, then, two main theories of the scientific symbol. Fortunately for the purposes of our argument, it is not necessary to decide between them. For my own part, I believe, with the an- tipositivists, that a purely operational theory cannot be carried out. The significant thing here is that for modern science its knowledge is largely symbolic in one or other of these two senses. What then does this position mean? It means, as we are told over and over again, by a Jeans and an Eddington, a Weyl and a Planck, that to an incalculable degree our concepts of the physical world are constructions, and the knowledge which they give, symbolic. Some draw the inference, as does for instance Weyl, that "science concedes to idealism that this, its objective world, is not given but only propounded (like a problem to be solved) and that it can be constructed only by symbols." For myself, I draw the same idealistic inferences as does Weyl, but that is not necessary for the present argument. All that is necessary is the acceptance of symbolism as a scientific principle, namely, that the objective world can be known only symbolically. This then is what I understand by symbolism as a scientific principle. It means, not only that scientific concepts are in the main not copies but symbols, but also that a theory of scientific symbolism must be made a part of the methodology and epis- temology of science. This notion is not only important in itself, but also so sig- nificant for the rest of my argument that further comment is desirable. It has been given much more detailed and specific expression in two recent papers by H. Margenau, an important study of the epistemological and philosophical problems set by the developments of modern physics.3 He recognizes symbolism 3 H. Margenau, Methodology of Modern Physics, Philosophy of Science, Vol. II, Nos. I and 2 (January and April, I935).</page><page sequence="11">286 Symbolism as a scientific principle in physics and considers the problem of the "ontological status" of its symbolic constructs. He adopts the partial correspondence theory of symbols; the constructs of physics correspond to the perceptual world but this correspond- ence is not a one to one correspondence. The world of physics has, he holds, retained its connection with the perceptible world but that connection has now been placed on a statistical footing. He finds it necessary to distinguish three classes of physical constructs or symbols, (a) the sensible, (b) the pseudo-sensible and (c) the abstract and wholly "insensible." "Quantum me- chanics actually replaces the electron and any other physical system by abstract constructs of this sort." "If the physicist," he tells us, "were to restrict himself exclusively to the use of sensible and pseudo-sensible constructs his dream of an ultimate system of explanation would never come true." In his section on the ontological status of these constructs he insists (p. I65), as his main point, that "physical constructs cannot be said either to exist or not exist; their ontological status has to be fixed in accordance with a more elaborate analysis of the meaning of existence. In particular, the value of a construct bears ab- solutely no relation to its mode of existence." The question of the mode of existence, he further indicates, is not so much a physical as metaphysical question; problems of this type can be solved only by an analysis of the notions of existence and being, and this involves a larger universe of dis- course than that which belongs to physics. SYMBOLISM AND PHYSICAL WHOLES The symbolic character of physical concepts is then quite generally recognized by modern physicists. On the assumption- which I think would scarcely be questioned-that physics is the basal science and that its methods are normative scientifically- we may say that symbolism as a scientific principle is established. Our problem now is to consider the symbol in relation to physical wholes. The thesis laid down by Jeans-and to this there would in</page><page sequence="12">W. M. Urban 287 principle be no objection on the part of physicists-is that physics includes propositions about wholes, and the greater the whole the more symbolic the representation. That physics (as indeed all the sciences) does make propositions about wholes- and that unless science is truncated, such propositions are part of science, has already been established. We may call them cos- mological propositions, propositions about the physical universe or cosmos. All such propositions are preeminently symbolic. The infinitely little and the infinitely great are equally beyond the ken of literal knowledge. The discoveries of modern physics, we are told, have not only given new content to our existing frame- work of concepts, but have placed that framework in question and remade it. Even our concepts themselves have been re- vealed as appropriate to moderate dimensions only. The recog- nition of this fact constitutes, Reichenbach holds, in Atom and Cosmos, the Copernican crisis of our time. This crisis has made it clear, not only that the basic concepts of science must them- selve be changed (as in our notions of space and time in the theory of relativity) but that the relations of these concepts to their objects is symbolic. With many implications of this situation we are not here con- cerned; we are interested solely in its bearing on our argument. The upshot of all this is that science also speaks about the cosmos, about physical universes. It too seeks to round out its knowledge by propositions about met-empirical wholes, about the infinitely great and the infinitely little, and that such propositions cannot be other than symbolic. One consequence should, however, be emphasized because of its bearing upon our later argument. It concerns the status of these theories of the universe-the cosmic theories of astronomical physics. The symbolic character of such notions as the building up or running down of the universe, or its expanding as a soap bubble should be obvious. They are formed by extending to the physical cosmos as a whole, notions taken from narrower regions of immediate experience. Whether, and in what sense, such theories are empirically verifiable is a question which I shall not consider in this context. It may be</page><page sequence="13">288 Symbolism that they are to be classed as scientific "myths," as held by some positivists. Enough that whatever truth they have is symbolic and not literal. LITERAL AND SYMBOLIC KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE A further question concerning symbolism as a scientific prin- ciple must be considered before we pass to the related question of symbolism as a metaphysical principle. It concerns the very difficult question of the relation of symbolic to literal knowledge in science. All modern scientists seem to agree with Kant that "much of what is ordinarily thought of as examples of pure understanding is to be reckoned as examples of symbolic knowledge." The question is, which parts and how much. An extreme view is that all our scientific knowledge is symbolic and that the mathematical symbols are normative. Thus Jeans: "Our knowledge of the external world must always consist of numbers and our picture of the universe-the synthesis of our knowledge, must necessarily be mathematical in form. All the concrete details of the picture, the apples, the pears and the bananas, the ether and atoms and electrons, are mere clothing that we ourselves drape over our mathematical symbols-they do not belong to nature, but to the parables by which we seek to make nature comprehensible." I cannot help feeling that a statement such as this raises serious difficulties, difficulties which I find quite common in writings on scientific epistemology. It seems to imply that all scientific knowledge is symbolic, that of number, and that of the "par- ables." This cannot really be, for the concept of symbolic knowl- edge is meaningless except as contrasted with the non-symbolic. It is not necessary for our purposes to determine exactly what elements in science are non-symbolic, but that there are such, in Kant's terms "examples of the understanding, is certain." All that we care to insist upon here is that there must be non-symbolic knowledge-a point of importance when we come to symbolism as a metaphysical principle. Again in this same statement it seems to be implied that math-</page><page sequence="14">W. M. Urban 289 ematical symbols must be ultimate in our knowledge of the universe, or, as Jeans expresses it, the synthesis of our knowledge must necessarily be in mathematical form. Now it seems to me to be of real importance that this statement should be questioned. Our knowledge, even of the external world cannot consist merely in numbers, for numbers of themselves "say nothing." The mathematical formula, as Whitehead insists, must be interpreted or it is meaningless. It is, after all, the parables, the non-math- ematical symbols that, even for Jeans are necessary for under- standing. Numbers merely manipulate. A science, if it were possible, that was merely a body of mathematical symbolisms, would say nothing. Interpretation involves translation into language and this involves the other type of symbolism. Cosmological discourse, for instance, can never be purely mathematical. There is a great gap between the mathematics of the law of increasing entropy and the dramatic proposition that the universe is running down. The latter simply cannot be stated without the element of "parable," that is by carrying over, through analogous predication, of an image of the sensible world and applying it to the non-intuitible whole. Be this as it may, whether mathematical language is ultimate for science or not-it cannot be for knowledge as a whole. If there is such a thing as metaphysical knowledge, its language and symbolism must be of another type. SYMBOLISM AS A METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE My first contention was not only that if science is possible, metaphysics is possible, but rather that science, unless it is caricatured, is possible only if metaphysics is possible. My second contention is that just as scientific knowledge is under- standable only when it is recognized as symbolic, so metaphysical knowledge must have the element of the symbolic. In short, I shall discuss symbolism as a metaphysical principle. Now the metaphysical symbol, in this special sense, must differ, of course, significantly from the scientific symbol. As I pointed out in an earlier section, there is a real difference between the metaphysical elements or propositions in science and those which</page><page sequence="15">290 Symbolism constitute metaphysic proper. Both deal with subjects of dis- course which are limitless, inexhaustible, and, therefore, indeter- minate. Both speak of wholes or worlds which are met-empirical and therefore, not observable entities to which the propositions may be referred. But in the case of science they are always partial wholes; in the case of metaphysics proper it is the whole of reality that is ultimately the subject of discourse. Now it may be that the first or scientific form of discourse is meaningful and that symbolism and symbolic knowledge is here possible. It may be, however, that metaphysical discourse in the second sense is not meaningful and metaphysics as knowledge not possible. I have already indicated why no such fundamental distinction can be made. But the distinction is insisted upon so constantly and raises issues of such importance that the point must be met before we can proceed further. It is argued that to be able to predicate anything of the whole in a meaningful way it is required that this whole be envisaged as really not the totality of totalities but itself a thing among other things. More technically expressed, if everything is a totality and this totality is not itself one of the everythings, then we have a totality of everything and the totality and so on, so that there is no totality except as a collection. It is thus maintained that we cannot avoid a fallacy necessarily involved in the notion of a totality.4 Such fallacy is especially evident when it is ex- pressed in terms of the notion of an all-embracing system. Such a system could not be enlarged for it would already contain all that there is. If it can be enlarged it cannot be all-embracing, cannot be all that it claims to be. The very notion of a system or a totality has therefore been rendered self-contradictory and fallacious by being made all-embracing. Neither can its claim to absolute truth be absolute so long as it is possible to subject it to reinterpretation. An absolute system that is not final is a self-contradiction.5 4 See E. G. Spaulding, A World of Chance, p. 283. 5 Appeal is often made also to the "logical theory of types" to prove the impossibility of metaphysics in the sense of propositions about the whole. The theory of types is,</page><page sequence="16">W. M. Urban 29I Arguments of this type may be used either to show that meta- physical propositions are meaningless or that while they are not possible about the whole as a totality, the omnitudo realitatis, they are possible about the whole as a collection. So far as the last point is concerned I am not able to see that a distinction can be made. Any whole, even a loose connection, is just as met- empirical as a totality. Moreover, to say something about the whole as a collection involves saying something about it in a totalitarian sense. If I say of reality that it is plural, "my speech," despite what William James says, "bewrayeth me," for I am asserting that plurality is a character of reality taken in its totality and that is not an empirical but a metaphysical proposi- tion. This Kant showed once for all-even if many moderns have not seen it.6 The issues here involved are more than merely dialectical and should not be minimized. It is true that the moment one begins to talk about totality, the world or universe as we do about finite entities and partial wholes one is already on the brink of the unmeaning. To say that organisms develop or evolve is mean- ingful, to say that life evolves is still meaningful, although its meaning is more difficult to determine. But what meaning is there to the statement that the whole of reality, or everything, evolves? Now I think it must be admitted that we cannot speak about the whole without incurring just such difficulties, but I do not think they are insuperable. In principle science faces the same difficulties. In the case of science we escape the unmeaning by frankly recognizing the symbolic nature of our concepts and that the greater the whole, the more symbolic the representation. I do not see why we cannot escape the difficulties here in the same way. Literal propositions about metempirical wholes are in the however, becoming increasingly unsatisfactory, even from the standpoint of logic itself, and it is an open question whether its application to this type of problem is legitimate. In any case it is possible to state the point at issue without appealing to this debatable notion. In fact it was already done by Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason. 6 See my Intelligible World, p. 53.</page><page sequence="17">292 Symbolism nature of the case impossible in science no less than metaphysics. Kant showed, once and for all, that literal propositions about metaphysical wholes or totalities are impossible-that such literal extension of the categories from the phenomenal to the noumenal could lead only to transcendental illusion. But he did now show that they could not be extended symbolically. In fact, he specifically states in the Critique of Judgment that they can be so extended, and in this I fully agree with him. Let us consider certain typical metaphysical propositions of this type. It is said, for instance, that all is flux or change or as, in Schopenhauer, all is will. In panpsychisms we are told that all is beseelt or all is mind. Now I do not say that any or all of these statements are true; nor indeed that they are verifiable (although that is a question by itself and depends on analysis of the entire notion of verification); what I do say-and this is all that I am concerned with here-is that such propositions are meaningful. In propositions of this sort what we do is to take some aspect of experience, such as change, will, the mental, and give it a privileged position in the interpretation of the whole. We find such a statement meaningful, not because we can operate with it, or indeed verify it in the sense of the empirical criterion, but because we seem to "understand" with it. But that is equally true of what I have called the cosmic propositions of science. When we say that the physical universe is running down or building up it is equally impossible to operate with such con- ceptions or indeed to verify them empirically, for the universe here also is a limitless, and to that extent, metempirical, whole. Again when we employ such metaphysical predicates, we know full well that we are not using such notions as will, mind or what not literally-that we have moulded, stretched or redesigned our concepts in order to make them applicable to "all that is"- and that in so far as they are thus moulded, they are symbols- but this is also true of the scientific concepts. In sum, here again there is in principle no difference between the symbolisms of science and those of metaphysics. Sentences or propositions containing such symbols are meaningful in either case.</page><page sequence="18">W. M. Urban 293 THE NATURE OF THE METAPHYSICAL SYMBOL: THE NOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL METAPHOR Granted then that meaningful statements about the whole are possible, it is still clear that such statements will differ in impor- tant ways from statements about partial wholes, as for instance the physical wholes of science. There is a difference in the nature of the subjects of the propositions and this means a difference in the nature of the predicates. This difference we may describe by saying that the distinguishing character of the metaphysical symbol is that it is Fundamental Metaphor. This distinction has been well stated by Hoffding.7 "It is the character of all symbols, whether scientific, poetic or religious, that ideas or images are taken from the narrower and more intuitible regions of experience and used as expressions for more universal and ideal relations, which, because of their per- vasiveness and ideality, cannot be directly expressed. The metaphysical symbol shares this general character but differs at one important point. It differs from all others, including the scientific, in that it seeks to throw light on existence in its totality or in its innermost essence, by figures which are taken from a single fact or a single side of existence as it appears in our ex- perience." The figures or metaphors of metaphysics are taken from single aspects of experience, as indeed all metaphors must be; but by reason of the fact that they seek to throw light on existence in its totality, they must be uniquely determined, and this uniqueness is defined in terms of the notion of "fundamental metaphor."8 The crucial point here is the notion of fundamental. All thinking, as Nietzsche rightly saw, is "arbeiten mit den beliebsten Metaphoren." Even science works with metaphors 7 Philosophy of Religion, pp. 207 ff. 8 A somewhat similar view is developed by Stephen C. Pepper in an article entitled r'he Root Metaphor f'heory of Metaphysics, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XXXII, No. I4, July 4, I935. The notion of the origin of the metaphysical concept is roughly the same, but the "symbolism of metaphysics "is not related to that of science and the dis- tinctive character of the metaphysical symbol, as I conceive it, is not made clear.</page><page sequence="19">294 Symbolism and cannot indeed work otherwise. But the favorite metaphor here is determined by the purpose of scientific operation. If we use the metaphor of a machine-and that is of course what we do when we have a mechanistic notion of nature-we think of nature so, only because only when we work with such concepts can nature be controlled. If we use the metaphor of will or purpose, it is because only by such metaphors can nature be understood or made intelligible to us. Operation and under- standing are by no means the same thing. In metaphysics, however, the metaphor must be fundamental, that is, it must be taken from those ultimate and irreducible aspects of experienced reality without which experience could not be. It is this that metaphysics has always tried to do, however imperfectly. It has sought to discover those aspects of experi- ence which are all-pervasive and thus applicable to everything- in other words, "cosmic variables." One of the latest meta- physical attempts of this sort is that of Whitehead. His con- structions are definitely guided by this notion of fundamental metaphor, and he recognizes, I think, the essentially symbolic character of metaphysical knowledge although, perhaps, not with all its implications. I am glad to be able to quote a passage which seems to me specifically to recognize this fact. "Philos- ophers," he tells us, "can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles" (namely the experience categories which he assigns to all the occasions in nature). "Weakness of insight and deficiencies of language stand in the way inexorably. Words and phrases must be stretched toward a generality foreign to their ordinary usage; and however such elements of language be stabilized as technicalities, they remain metaphors (italics mine) mutely appealing for an imaginative leap."9 The stretch- ing of words and phrases towards generality means a moulding of our concepts into symbols. They remain metaphors and our metaphysical knowledge is ultimately symbolic in character. I am not, it should be understood, either arguing for the White- head metaphysics or for his use of symbols. Indeed, I find 9 Process and Reality, p. 6.</page><page sequence="20">W. M. Urban 295 great difficulties in this metaphysics and I feel that the imagina- tive leap for which his metaphors appeal (more particularly his use of feeling and value) makes too much demand upon us. All I am concerned to point out is that Whitehead's metaphysics is, when examined, an illustration of symbolism as a metaphysical principle. SYMBOLS NORMATIVE FOR METAPHYSICS Thus far in our treatment of symbolism as a metaphysical principle we have sought to establish two things (a) In the first place, that while the metaphysical symbol, eo nomine, differs in important respects from the symbol of science, there is no crucial difference such as would make the latter possible and the former impossible. In the second place, by reason of the difference between the two, the metaphysical symbol is of the nature of fundamental metaphor as above defined. In this notion of fundamental, however, is included an element which marks off the metaphysical symbol in a significant way from those of science. We shall call this the axiological character of the meta- physical symbol. Metaphysics, we found to be that fundamental activity by which we round out our experience through the postulation of metempirical entities. The legitimacy of this activity we found in the fact that without it knowledge and discourse cannot be made intelligible. When, however, we examine this experience which is to be thus rounded out, we find that, when taken in its totality or concreteness, it always contains value as a fundamental aspect. A fundamental metaphor must include this aspect, otherwise it is not fundamental. In developing this point I shall make use of a well known definition of metaphysics by Rickert. "The task of meta- physics," he tell us, "is the unitary interpretation of the total world in which there is both the real and the valuable. (Die metaphysik macht es sich zur Aufgabe die gesammte Welt, in der es Wirkliches und Werthaftes giebt, einheitlich zu deuten). If then this is the task of metaphysics-and I believe that it is-it follows inevitably that to interpret the world as a whole-a</page><page sequence="21">296 Symbolism world that actually contains both the real and the valuable, metaphysical concepts or symbols, in order to be fundamental- and adequate, must be, so to speak, value-charged. In other words axiological symbols must be normative for metaphysics. That certain types of symbols are fundamental-and therefore normative-for science seems to be unquestioned by many. Thus Jeans, in the address already quoted, seems to maintain that the universe is exhaustively analyzable in terms of pure mathematics, and only in so far as that analysis is carried out have we science. But to say that the concepts of the mathe- mematical physical sciences are those which are most suitable to the purposes of the biologist and psychologist, to say nothing of the historian, seems to be the very reverse of the truth. Organic wholes are a part of nature but the concepts of nature, the sym- bols by means of which their character as living is described and expressed are certainly not mathematical. However this may be (and for myself I hold that even in science the mathematical symbol is not normative, but that there is everywhere present what Bergson calls a "double symbolism") certainly in meta- physics symbolism of an entirely different type is necessary- precisely for the reason that in the total world to be symbolized the werthaftes is a determing part of that world. Metaphysical symbols, to be symbols, must have an axiological aspect. An essential part of the notion of fundamental metaphor is then that our metaphors or symbols must include the value side of experience. This fact may be described in two ways. We may say that the principle of the "primacy of the axiological", which, although he contests it, Nicolai Hartmann, recognizes as the characteristic principle of all traditional philosophy, is deter- minative. Or we may say that the language of metaphysics must inevitably be anthropomorphic and its symbols taken from the human and personal, rather than from the abstract and im- personal side of experience. The latter is the usual way of describing the situation and I have no objection to thus describ- ing it, for I am not as much afraid of anthropomorphism as most people. Indeed I am critical and sophisticated enough to see that science itself is no less anthropomorphic; it merely takes its</page><page sequence="22">W. M. Urban 297 metaphors from another side of human experience, as in the case of the motion of mechanism. But I prefer the notion of the primacy of the axiological. The symbols of metaphysics must be axiological for the reason that they cannot be fundamental unless they include the value side of experience. Whitehead has seen this necessity in including feeling and valuation among the cosmic variables, but still more clearly when, in Nature and Life he speaks of "that great metaphysical truth that all ultimate reasons must be in terms of aim at value." This general position has been well expressed by Eddington in his Science and the Unseen World. In referring to him in this connection, I wish to commit myself neither to all his scientific positions nor to his particular brand of philosophical idealism, but merely to indicate his sense of the difference between the scientific and the metaphysical symbol. He holds that it is of the very essence of the unseen world, with which the metaphysician deals, that here the conception of personality should dominate. Force, energy, dimensions, he maintains, belong to the world of sym- bols (and to a limited world at that). It is out of such concep- tions that we have built up the external world of physics. "What other conceptions have we?" he asks. "After exhausting physical methods we return to the inmost recesses of consciousness." Without raising the question whether the conception of personality should be dominant or normative here-that is a problem within metaphysics itself-we can at least say that axiological conceptions must dominate, and that such symbols must be normative for metaphysics. Such symbols are danger- ous, as all symbols are, even those of mathematics. But what is it that makes any symbol dangerous, whether scientific or other? Merely that it is taken literally. The literalist in science is as much a nuisance as in religion. The literalist in metaphysics, or the dogmatist in Kant's sense, is the supreme nuisance. This does not, however, affect in the least the question of a privileged position of symbols. In the age-old struggle between Idealism and Naturalism, the principle of the former that interpretation must proceed from above rather than from below, is to my mind final. This is the essence of symbolism as a metaphysical principle.</page><page sequence="23">298 Symbolism THE HISTORICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THIS INTERPRETATION OF METAPHYSICS I have now, I think, made clear what I understand by Symbol- ism as a Metaphysical Principle and why I think this view of metaphysics must be accepted. It remains now to justify this interpretation by reference to the history of metaphysical thought. For reasons of space I shall have to assume here two things which I have argued at great length in my Intelligible World. (I) That there is a philosophia perennis, a continuous stream of metaphysical thought with identical objectives and identical presuppositions, continuing up until the most recent times; and (2) that this perennial philosophy is essentially a "value charged scheme of thought", and can only so be understood. I may say, however, that the appearance, since then, of such books as Dewey's Questfor Certainty, Lovejoy's qThe Great Chain of Being, and Von Rintelen's Der Wertgedanke in den Europaischen Geistes- entwicklung have more than justified my interpretation. What I am concerned to maintain here is that "symbolism as a metaphysi- cal principle" has been an integral part of that tradition. It need hardly be said to those at home in this tradition that symbolism was a metaphysical principle throughout the entire movement of Greek and Mediaeval thought. Plato's use of myth and symbol was not the lapse of an inborn poet into his native dialect, but rested rather upon the recognition that while his myths were not precisely true, "something like it must be true." It rested even more fundamentally still upon a philosophy of language, especially developed in the Seventh Epistle which amounted essentially to the position that no language is possible which does not contain a symbolic element. That it continued through mediaeval times, theology, in both its positive and nega- tive type, makes clear. Our mental pictures of God are neces- sarily constructions built up from imperfect and human data. The entire doctrine of the via eminentie, and, still more funda- mentally, the Aristotelian doctrine of analogous predication upon which it was built, proves that. But I think Dean Inge is right when he insists that the same assumptions underlie the con- ceptions of the World in this metaphysics. We may summarize</page><page sequence="24">W. M. Urban 299 it all by saying with J. Huizinga, that "symbolism is the music of which the logically expressed propositions are merely the score." As the principle of symbolism is the key to the understanding of the spirit of traditional philosophy, so it is the denial of this principle which is, I think, the key to the understanding of much of modern philosophy. The entire story of critical philosophy since Hume and Kant is, as Mauthner has said, the progressive Selbstzersetzung des Metaphorischen. When literalism invaded religion through Protestantism, it invaded philosophy also. But to this was added another element, namely, the assumption of the literal character of scientific concepts. The entire anti-meta- physical movement of modern times is a reflection of the assump- tion of the literal truth of the Newtonian world picture. It was this assumption, and this alone, which as Bergson points out, made the negative element in the Kantian critique so powerful. In contrast to science, so conceived, the concepts of metaphysics became, of course, transcendentaler Schein. There is, of course, a positive side to Kant's thinking, and even he recognized in the Critique of 7udgment, symbolism as a metaphysical principle and the possibility of metaphysical and theological knowledge when the principle of symbolism was admitted. In the main, however, the antimetaphysical tendencies in modern science and philosophy arise out of the supposed literal character of all scientific knowledge. But if science itself is not literal-if it is symbolic in the sense and to the extent described, if, in other words, symbolism has become a scientific principle- must not the entire position with regard to metaphysics be recon- sidered? Such at least is my thesis. I am inclined to think that both culturally and philosophically, the notion of science as symbolic is one of the most important aspects of modern science. It has brought the entire problem of symbolic knowledge into the foreground and I am inclined to believe, that when this problem is fully worked out and its implications fully realized, the problem of the relation of science to philosophy will take on a new form.
