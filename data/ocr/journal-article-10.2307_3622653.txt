<plain_text><page sequence="1">REASON, REVELATION AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT ROBERT EISEN In his major philosophical work, Milhamot ha-Shem, and in his biblical commentaries, Gersonides identifies several doctrines as fundamental principles of the Torah, or pinnot ha-torah. How these principles are derived and what function they serve is never fully clarified by Gersonides. Charles Touati - who, to my knowledge, is the only scholar to address the issue - contends that the pinnot ha-torah are effectively articles of faith modelled on Maimonides' thirteen principles in the introduc- tion to his commentary on the tenth chapter of Mishnah Sanhedrin, Perek Helek. Touati lists seven such pinnot which are scattered throughout Gersonides' writings.1 The discovery of articles of faith in Gersonides would not be insignificant. A whole series of questions would immedia- tely be raised that bear on Gersonides' philosophy as a whole. Why are these particular principles chosen? What does their selection teach us about Gersonides' philosophical system? To whom are they directed? It is my contention, however, that Touati's conclusions are premature. In the following pages, I will try to show that the pinnot ha-torah are indeed significant in the overall scheme of Gersonides' thought, but not as articles of faith. It will be argued that the pinnot ha-torah are key concepts for determin- ing the nature of the relationship between philosophical truth and the Bible. They are doctrines derived primarily from ' Charles Touati, La pense philosophique et theologique de Gersonide (Paris, 1973), pp. 484-5.</page><page sequence="2">Scripture, the function of which is to set limits for the direction of philosophical enquiry. It will also be demonstrated that Gersonides' conception ofPinnot ha-torah originates with Mai- monides, not from his discussion in Perek Helek, but from his position on creation in the Guide. I should point out that I will not attempt a thorough examina- tion of each and every one of the pinnot ha-torah. As we shall soon see, Touati has greatly underestimated the number of pinnot ha-torah in Gersonides' writings. The complete list covers an impressive range of doctrines that touch on all the major aspects of Gersonides' philosophical and religious thought. An exhaustive discussion of the pinnot would therefore not be feasible here. We will, instead, attempt to highlight the basic features of these principles, while demonstrating their significance in Gersonides' thinking.2 Before discussing the fundamental principles of the Torah in Gersonides' thought, we must first delineate Gersonides' posi- tion on the Bible as a source for philosophical speculation. The central programmatic statement with respect to this issue is 2 References to Milhamot ha-Shem are cited from the 1866 Leipzig edition with the abbreviation, MH.

There, Gersonides states that the Bible must be interpreted to conform to demonstrative truths discovered in the course of philosoph- ical investigation, a position which he acknowledges is drawn from Maimonides: ...if reason causes us to affirm doctrines that are incompat- ible with the literal sense of Scripture, we are not prohib- ited by the Torah to pronounce the truth on these matters, for reason is not incompatible with the true understanding of the Torah.3 Gersonides goes on to explain that, like Maimonides, he is prepared to interpret the Torah to affirm the eternity of the universe if reason were to require us to believe in that doctrine.4 Gersonides, therefore, plans in Milhamot ha-Shem to adopt the method of first conducting a thorough philosophical inves- tigation of various issues, and then showing how those views can be confirmed in the Torah.5 Gersonides expresses confidence in the ultimate identity between the philosophical conclusions in his own treatise and the doctrines found in Scripture. In fact, the name of the treatise, Milhamot ha-Shem, is derived from the notion that the false views of his predecessors have been refuted in the course of demonstrating philosophically that his own views accord with the "view of our Torah."6 This method of harmonizing philosophy and Scripture in- vites an obvious question. If Scripture is always interpreted to conform to truths arrived at by philosophy, is there really any need for Scripture? Has its role not become superfluous? Gersonides responds to this problem with the affirmation that the Bible indeed serves a positive, active role in philosoph- 3MH, pp. 6-7; WL 1, p. 98. 4 See Guidefor the Perplexed, trans.

With some philosophical problems - especially the difficult ones - the Bible itself has directed him towards the truth. The Bible, therefore, does not serve an exclusively passive role in philosophical investigation, but itself becomes part of the enquiry by furnishing valuable clues to solve philosophy's most difficult problems.7 Touati has astutely focused on Gersonides' notion of the Torah as "haysharah, "or "guide," as a central motif in his attitude towards the Torah. As haysharah, the Torah leads the philosopher in the correct path of investigation without necessarily providing clear and explicit answers.8 In his discussion of creation in Milhamot ha-Shem, for example, Gersonides includes a lengthy exegesis of the biblical account which he claims was instrumental in guiding him towards his theory.9 Even more noteworthy is his analysis of miracles at the very end of the treatise which is based entirely on the data provided in biblical sources.10 The value of pro- phetic revelation is therefore upheld as an essential source which helps lead one to proper philosophical conclusions and not merely as a text to be interpreted once the investigation is complete. This function, however, is not the only active role that Scripture plays. Gersonides also alludes in several passages to pinnot ha-torah, or "fundamental principles of the Torah," biblical doctrines that play an important role in philosophical discourse. 7 MH, pp. 6-7; WL 1, p. 98; Gersonides repeats his position on the relationship between philosophy and Scripture in a later passage in Milhamot ha-Shem, p. 419; see also C. Prov. 30:4. It should be pointed out that, in these passages, Gersonides refers specifically to the Torah and not the Bible as a whole. However, what he is saying here applies in practical terms to the entire range of Scriptural sources. In Milhamot ha-Shem he tends not to distinguish between the Torah and the rest of the Bible when citing prooftexts. 8 Ibid., Touati, pp. 94-5. 9 MH, pp. 418-41. 10 MH, pp. 441-2.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT In Milhamot ha-Shem, Gersonides says very little about how these principles function. At first, they seem to have no active role in philosophical speculation. While summing up the main points of his introduction, Gersonides claims that in the course of settling the philosophical problems he has chosen to discuss, "the fundamental principles of the Torah [ha-pinnot ha-toriy- yot] will in their entirety have been established."" In another passage, Gersonides alludes in passing to the "principles of the Torah" (ha-pinnot ha-toriyyot) which are based upon the topics of discussion in his treatise.12 Gersonides thus envisions a set of fundamental principles of the Torah which are confirmed in the course of his philosophical discussions. Gersonides' position of these principles takes a new turn, however, in book three of Milhamot ha-Shem. While trying to show how his position on divine knowledge is identical to that of the Torah, Gersonides depicts the fundamental principles of the Torah as functioning in a more active role. Gersonides repeats his contention that when a literal understanding of the Torah conflicts with what has been proven philosophically, one must interpret the Torah to conform to truths derived from philosophy. Yet, he then adds that one follows this procedure "so long as none of the fundamental principles of the Torah [pinnah mi-pinnot ha-torah] is destroyed." Gersonides claims that Maimonides also followed this practice in many cases in his Guide for the Perplexed. 3 A more explicit statement which affirms the active role of these principles is in Gersonides' Commentary on Proverbs: "Incline your ears to the words of the hakhamim [Prov. 22:17] - to learn their philosophy. But also "pay attention " MH, p. 10; WL 1, p. 104. Feldman translates ha-pinnot ha-toriyyot here as "basic principles of the Torah." For the sake of consistency, I have substituted "fundamental principles of the Torah", since that is the coinage I will be using throughout this paper. 12 MH, p. 6; WL 1, p. 97. 13 MH, p. 150; WL 2, p. 136.

[Heed their words] only in that which agrees with what I have made known to you as founded upon the fundamental principles of the Torah.14 For the Torah guides [one] to comprehend what can be comprehended of me by way of wisdom. Here again the fundamental principles of the Torah appear to exercise what amounts to a veto power over the conclusions arrived at by philosophy. These passages conflict with Gersonides' introductory re- marks in Mil4amot ha-Shem for a couple of reasons. First, in the introduction to Milhamot ha-Shem, the principles of the Torah were seen as being confirmed from the consequences of philosophical enquiry; now, they are antecedent to philosoph- ical enquiry and function as a significant factor in controlling the whole direction of philosophical discussion. Second, and more important, the notion that the pinnot ha-torah set limits to what philosophical reasoning can prove contradicts the posi- tion, also voiced in the introduction to Milhamot ha-Shem, that one must always interpret the Torah to conform to truths arrived at through philosophical speculation. Whether Gersonides was aware of these conflicts, or saw them as true inconsistencies, is not clear. He makes no attempt to reconcile his various statements. We will proceed with the assumption that there is an active role for the pinnot ha-torah in Gresonides' method. Certainly, the two passages in Milhamot ha-Shem and in the Commentary on Proverbs are evidence enough that the pinnot ha-torah, at least in some instances, exert decisive influence on philosophical speculation. The validity of this assumption will also be confirmed, I trust, in the course of further investigation. Gersonides' relationship to Maimonides and the passage to which he alludes here. 14 Here, Gersonides uses the term, yesodot ha-torah which is occasionally used as an alternative form for pinnot ha-torah (infra, p. 17 n.). It would appear that Gersonides sees God as the speaker in this passage. 16 ROBERT EISEN [6]</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT The major problem is that Gersonides says so little about the precise character and function of these principles. Gersonides never explains how these principles are derived, nor does he clarify why they exert such influence on philosophical discus- sion. Touati argues that they are articles of faith modelled on those of Maimonides, an interpretation that could explain their centrality for philosophical speculation.15 However, Gersonides never actually compiles these principles into an independent list as Maimonides does and never once identifies them as articles of faith. Furthermore, Touati compiles a list of only seven pinnot scattered throughout Gersonides' philosophical and exegetical writings. In fact, this list is far from complete.16 I have found no less than twenty-one pinnot ha-torah in Gerson- ides' writings covering an impressive range of doctrines. This number of principles would appear to be rather unwieldy to serve as a series of basic dogmas or beliefs, an observation which adds to the unlikelihood of his assessment. The following is a list of doctrines referred to as pinnot ha-torah in Gersonides' writings:17 1. God's existence18 2. God's oneness19 3. creation20 15 Touati, pp. 484-5. According to Touati, pinnah is a translation of the Arabic term, qa'ida, which often refers to a fundamental dogma or belief. 16 Touati's list includes the following beliefs: God's existence, creation, miracles, prophecy, ultimate joy is in being close to God, all nations will eventually worship God, resurrection of the dead. "7 While the term, pinnah, is the most common designation for these principles, it is not the only one. Gersonides occasionally refers to a principle as a "root", shoresh (CT, pp. 104c, 213c to. 1; C. I Kings 11 to. 3) and more rarely as "foundation", yesod (CT, p. 34c, to. 3; C. Prov. 22:17). 18 CT, pp. 171c, 21 lb to. 2. 19 This concept is referred to explicitly in CT, p. 213b to. 2, and then identified as one of the pinnot in to. 4. 20 CT, p. 7 lb to. 3; C. I Chron. 29 to. 6. Gersonides appears to be inconsistent with regard to this principle.

(resurrection of the dead39) In order to gain some insight into the pinnot ha-torah, we should start with a basic observation. Implicit in Gersonides' remarks is that the pinnot ha-torah are distinguished by their being based in Scripture as opposed to philosophical reasoning. His approach, as we have described it up to now, is predicated on the distinction between the fundamental principles of the Torah, on the one hand, and doctrines deduced by philosoph- ical method, on the other. Gersonides uses terminology in his biblical commentaries which canonizes this distinction. On occasion, Gersonides refers to his major philosophical positions in Milhamot ha-Shem as "fundamental principles of philosophy," or pinnot creation - which is not Gersonides' intent. The Torah is everlasting in that, once given at Sinai, it will never be revoked. 36 CT, pp. 240c, 241c to. 5. 37 CT, p. 227d to. 10. In this passage the messianic age is not specifically mentioned. However, this to'elet is based on a passage in CT, p. 225c-d, where the messianic age is definitely part of the formulation. 38 C. I Chron. 29 to. 6. 39 C. I Sam. 7 to. 21. It is unclear whether Gersonides sees resurrection as one of the pinnot ha-torah. Resurrection is referred to as one of the "principles of faith" (pinnot ha-'emunah), the only principle with this designation. How- ever, there may be nothing terribly significant here. While introducing various principles of the Torah in C. I Chron. 29 to. 6, Gersonides refers to pinnot ha-torah ve-ha-'emunah, which would suggest that the phrase, pinnot ha-torah, is interchangeable with pinnot ha-'emunah. This concept deserves a full study of its own, one that will not be attempted in this paper. See Menahem Kellner, "Gersonides on Miracles, the Messiah and Resurrection of the Dead," Da'at 4 (Winter, 1980): 5-34. 19</page><page sequence="10">ha-'iyyun.40 Therefore it is clear that there are principles which are derived from philosophical discourse, pinnot ha-'iyyun, and those which in contrast are derived from Scripture, pinnot ha-torah. There is a good deal of overlap between the two sets of principles. In his biblical commentaries Gersonides will often refer to a principle as belonging both to philosophy and the Torah simultaneously.41 The same principle can belong to either category depending on whether philosophical or exegeti- cal means happen to be used in formulating a particular doc- trine. These observations fall in line with Gersonides' assertion in the introduction to Milhamot ha-Shem that the pinnot ha-torah are confirmed by philosophical discourse. It should also be noted that the pinnot ha-torah are not doctrines derived exclusively from the Pentateuch. Many of these principles are drawn from the Prophets and the Writings. When referring to the fundamental principles of the Torah, Gersonides therefore uses the term, torah, rather loosely to refer to all parts of the Bible. That the pinnot ha-torah are scripturally based, however, still does not tell us very much. We still do not know why specific biblical doctrines are selected, nor do we know why they have such an important role to play in the process of philosophical enquiry. Perhaps the best clue for understanding the pinnot ha-torah is the reference cited earlier from book three of Milhamot ha-Shem. Recall that Gersonides names Maimonides' Guide as the source of his position that the one must interpret Scripture to conform to philosophical truth so long as none of the fundamental principles of the Torah is destroyed.42 Maimonides' writings do indeed contain frequent references to fundamental principles of the Torah. The entire first book of 40 See, for example, CT, p. 194a, where the notion of immortality is referred to this way. 41 See, for example, CT, pp. 104d, 213c to. 10; C. I Chron. 21:12. 42 Supra, p. 15. 20 ROBERT EISEN [10]</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT the Mishneh Torah, in fact, is devoted to that issue: Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah. In the Guide for the Perplexed there are also numerous references to the qawa'id al-shari'a, a phrase which is translated by Ibn Tibbon as either yesodei ha-torah or pinnot ha-torah. Maimonides seems to have used this concept in flexible fashion. In the introduction to Perek Helek, for example, Maimonides applies the phrase qawa'id al-shari'a to the thir- teen principles of belief. In this context, the fundamental principles of the Torah are synonymous with the basic dogmas of Judaism.43 However, in the Guide, there is evidence that the concept of principles of the Torah takes on new meaning. In the celebrated discussion of creation in the second part of the Guide, there emerges a distinctly hermeneutical function for these princi- ples. In Guide 11:25, Maimonides explains why he does not resort to interpreting the biblical account of creation to support the Aristotelian conception of an eternal universe. Biblical interpretation, after all, was used earlier in response to the problem of biblical anthropomorphism. Maimonides offers two reasons for his reluctance to interpret the biblical sources according to Aristotle's view. First, there is demonstrative proof for God's incorporeality, while such proof is lacking for the theory of an eternal universe. Second - and this is the point that interests us most - reinterpreting the anthropomorphic references in the Bible in no way destroys "the foundations of the Law" (qawa'id al-shari'a); however, the reinterpretation of the creation story "destroys the Law in its principle." Maimonides goes on to explain that the notion of an eternal universe would assume that God performs all his activi- ties by virtue of absolute necessity; consequently, basic biblical concepts, such as willful divine intervention in the form of 43 The thirteen articles of faith, and some of the terminology that we are analyzing here, is discussed in Menahem Kellner's comprehensive study, Dogmas in Medieval Jewish Thought (Oxford, 1986), pp. 10-66. 21</page><page sequence="12">22 ROBERT EISEN [12] miracles, and reward and punishment, would be reduced to sheer nonsense.44 What is most important here is that Maimonides is using the phrase, "foundations of the Law", in a manner very different from that in Perek .Helek. Here, they no longer represent basic dogmas of Judaism, but take on a hermeneutical character. In the introduction to Perek Ielek, the belief in God's incorporea- lity is a foundation of the Law by virtue of being one of the articles of faith. In the Guide, however, Maimonides explicitly rejects the belief in God's incorporeality as one of these founda- tions. Instead, the foundations on the Law are such concepts as miracles, reward and punishment - concepts which must be upheld in order to preserve the intelligibility of the Torah. Since Gods' incorporeality does not serve this function, it does not qualify. Clearly, the foundations of the Law are seen in our passage in the Guide as playing an exclusively interpretive role and are not to be identified with the thirteen articles of faith.45 Maimonides' position on the issue, however, is not the focus of our concerns.46 What is central for us is that Gersonides appears to adopt Maimonides' conception of "foundations of the Law" as a hermeneutical device. In the key passage in Milhamot ha-Shem, Gersonides explicitly names the Guide as 44 Guide, 11:25, pp. 327-9. Pines tends to translate qawa'id al-shari'a as "foundations of the Law." We will be using this phrase interchangeably with "fundamental principles of the Law." 45 These observations may help explain why Maimonides in the Guide will sometimes refer to foundations of the Law which have nothing to do with the thirteen articles of faith. Thus, Maimonides in Guide, 11:2, p. 253, sees the existence of angels as one of the fundamental principles of the Law, a concept not enumerated in Perek Ifelek; other doctrines which are termed foundations of the Law in the Guide and are not included in the thirteen articles are listed by Kellner in Dogmas, p. 53. Whether these concepts are seen by Maimonides as serving the same function in philosophical discussion as miracles, reward and punishment, is a question that is worthy of separate study. 46 The complexity of Maimonides' position cannot be dealt with here. An analysis of the foundations of the Law in Maimonides' thought would involve a thorough discussion of how this concept is used throughout his writings.</page><page sequence="13">[ 13] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT his source for the notion that one can interpret the Bible "so long as none of the fundamental principles of the Torah is destroyed" - a position which appears to be based on Maimon- ides' discussion of creation. As in Maimonides, Gersonides is stating that the Bible should be interpreted to conform to philosophical truth, but not at the expense of robbing Scripture of its basic intelligibility. The pinnot ha-torah would be those doctrines which minimally preserve the contents of the Torah in this regard. Some of the terminology used by Gersonides in reference to the pinnot ha-torah is reminiscent of that used in the Guide when Maimonides refers to such principles. Moreover, this terminology reflects the very function which the pinnot are designed to serve according to Maimonides' formulation in the discussion on creation. For instance, providence - one of the more important pinnot - is described by Gerson- ides as a doctrine "upon which the Torah in its entirety is built."47 Similar language is used to describe the doctrine of free will, which is "one of the great principles of the Torah upon which it is built."48 This imagery is borrowed directly from a passage in the Guide where Maimonides refers to individual providence as "one of the fundamental principles of the Law, which is built upon it..."49 Thus, the pinnot are envisioned literally as foundations upon which the structure of the Torah is supported. This conception is extended by Gersonides into another metaphor. Gersonides will sometimes refer to one of the pinnot as a doctrine without which "the Torah in its entirety would collapse" (tippol ha-torah bi-khlalah), an image which again calls upon the analogy of a building standing upon its foundation.50 47 CT, p. 20c to. 1. 48 C. I Kings 22 to. 24. 49 Guide III:18, p. 475; in the Ibn Tibbon translation, hu pinnah mi-pinnot ha-torah ve-'aleha binyanah (p. 27a, standard editions). 50 This metaphor is applied most frequently to prophecy; see CT, pp. 25b, 26c to. 4; I Chron. 29 to. 6. See also the complete passage in the previous reference. 23</page><page sequence="14">There is another feature in Gersonides' conception of the pinnot which can be traced to Maimonides. In several of Gersonides' references, some of the pinnot ha-torah are depen- dent on other pinnot. For instance, Gersonides explicitly states that the belief in prophecy is dependent on the notion that God's promises to the prophets are fulfilled.5' In fact, some doctrines appear to qualify as pinnot ha-torah only because they support other doctrines central to the Bible, not because they are themselves essential. For instance, it is not immediately apparent why Gersonides includes as one of the pinnot ha-torah the notion that events in the sublunar world are controlled by the movements of the spheres. How- ever, Gersonides is careful to explain in the passage which describes this pinnah that this conception is necessary for the denial of dualism and for upholding the oneness of God. That is, it is important to recognize that the realm of the spheres and the sublunar world are not controlled by separate deities but by one God. The oneness of God is itself one of the pinnot ha-torah, and it is clear therefore that believing in the influence of the spheres upon the sublunar world becomes one of the pinnot by virtue of its association with this central biblical doctrine.52 There are other principles which can be understood through a similar type of interdependence. The notion that God emanates goodness into the world out of mercy and kindness, not neces- sity, is another principle that in itself seems to be a rather odd choice as one of the pinnot ha-torah. Yet, it is important to take note that Gersonides introduces this notion as one of the pinnot in explicit connection with the doctrine of creation. Gersonides points out that if emanation were to occur by virtue of blind 5' C. I Chron. 29 to. 6. 52 CT, pp. 104d-105a. The notion that the oneness of God is one of the pinnot ha-torah needs no justification. The Maimonidean notion that the Torah was given to teach the oneness of God and to stamp out idol-worship is a doctrine that permeates Gersonides' thought. 24 ROBERT EISEN [14]</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT 25 necessity, the Aristotelian view of an eternal universe would necessarily follow.53 What about creation itself? Why does it qualify as one of the pinnot ha-torah? Gersonides appears to have viewed it as one of the fundamental principles for the same reason Maimonides does. At the very beginning of his commentary on Genesis, Gersonides points out that belief in creation is a necessary prerequisite for the belief in miracles.54 Here we have an example where a chain of three pinnot are dependent on each other; non-necessary emanation supports the doctrine of crea- tion which in turn supports the doctrine of miracles. The inclusion of certain commandments only make sense in light of these observations. The Sabbath, for instance, is seen as one of the pinnot ha-torah because it too supports the notion of creation.5 The notion that some of the pinnot ha-torah are dependent on each other is also a concept that can be traced to Maimonides. We have already seen that creation is one of the fundamental principles of the Torah because it is a necessary prerequisite for the concept of miracles. In another passage in the Guide, Maimonides specifically sees the belief in the existence of angels which is elsewhere identified as one of the fundamental 3 CT, p. 182a. 54 Gersonides makes this connection in CT, p. 9a. Why Gersonides sees the belief in creation as necessary for the belief in miracles is a very complex issue that deserves separate treatment. Touati argues that Gersonides' discussion of creation in book six of Milhamot ha-Shem precedes the discussion of creation because of the intimate connection between the two (pp. 163-4). The key issue is how Gersonides views divine will especially with regard to creation. See Touati, pp. 205-7; Menahem Kellner, "Gersonides on the Problem of Volitional Creation," HUCA 51 (1980): 11-28. 55 CT, p. 71 d to. 3. The command to love God is also one of pinnot ha-torah. The reason for its inclusion is somewhat obvious. In several places, Gersonides emphasizes that the entire Torah is designed to inculcate love of God. See, for instance, CT, p. 227d to. 10. Thus, the entire set of divine directives is tied up with this particular command.</page><page sequence="16">26 ROBERT EISEN [16] principles of the Torah - as a necessary prerequisite for believing in prophecy, another such principle.56 It is important to point out that these observations have important implications for the philosophical status of these principles. Earlier, we said that the pinnot ha-torah are in harmony with the conclusions of philosophical speculation because they have to be; the fundamental principles of the Torah place limits on the direction of philosophical enquiry. According to this formulation, the pinnot ha-torah are indepen- dent of and antecedent to the process of philosophical investi- gation. Yet, it is evident from what we have just said about the dependence of some pinnot on others that the issue is more complex - more so than Gersonides himself may have in- tended. Some of these fundamental principles can only be properly understood by approaching the biblical text with the help of prior philosophical knowledge. It is noteworthy that in all these cases one principle is linked to another on the basis of insights which only the philosopher can provide. Thus, the notion that creation is one of the pinnot ha-torah because it allows for miracles, presumes that the philosophical connection between creation and miracles is evident. The same goes for the concept that the movements of the heavens are responsible for events in the sublunar realm. That this concept is one of the pinnot because it supports the notion of God's oneness again assumes that one is acquainted with basic issues in metaphys- ics. Thus, the notion that the pinnot ha-torah can be derived purely from Scripture does not always hold true. In some instances Gersonides appears to depart from Mai- monides' position in subtle but important ways. There are indications that some doctrines are pinnot ha-torah in allowing 56 Guide, 111:45, pp. 576-7. The existence of the Separate Intellects, which are identified with angels in Maimonides' thought, is referred to as one of the fundamental principles of the Torah in Guide, 11:2, p. 253. Prophecy is identified as one of the fundamental principles in Guide, III:24, p. 502.</page><page sequence="17">[17] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT for the very possibility of revelation itself. Here, it is not so much the intelligibility of the Torah which is at stake, but the historical fact of revelation which allows for a Torah to exist in the first place. For instance, in one passage where Gersonides refers to prophecy as one of the pinnot ha-torah, he adds the following remark: ...and this [prophecy] is a great fundamental principle [shoresh] and a mighty pillar for affirming the communica- tion of the Torah from God by means of prophecy, for without this belief [in prophecy] the Torah in its entirety would collapse.57 The suggestion here is that prophecy is one of the pinnot ha-torah because without it there could no revelation to Moses and therefore no Torah. Other doctrines which Gersonides views as pinnot ha-torah could be seen as serving a function similar to that of prophecy. The belief in God, for instance, is obviously necessary for believing in the possibility of a revelation at Sinai. The belief in providence could also be seen as having a similar status. Since providence and prophecy are closely identified in Gersonides' philosophy, it is possible that Gersonides sees the belief in providence as serving the same purpose that prophecy does. Without it the possibility that God would give the Torah to the Jews would be precluded. Only a God who exercises providence would be interested in providing the Jewish people with a revealed text to guide them in their relationship with God.58 An instance in which Gersonides applies the concept of pinnot ha-torah in a rather novel way is with regard to the 57 CT, p. 26c to. 4. In several other places, Gersonides emphasizes that the Torah would collapse without the belief in prophecy; see, CT, p. 25b; I Chron. 29 to. 6. 58 One might also see the belief in miracles in this way. That belief may also be a prerequisite for accepting the revelation at Sinai, since Gersonides describes Mosaic prophecy at one point as nothing less than a miracle. See CT, pp. 209d-210a to. 8. See also Menahem Kellner, "Maimonides and Gersonides on Mosaic Prophecy," Speculum 52 (1977): 62-79. 27</page><page sequence="18">28 ROBERT EISEN [18] doctrine that the reasons for the mitsvot are only fully known by God. The explanation for this position is as follows: ...for this [concept that only God knows fully the reasons for the commandments] is that which safeguards men from sinning to some extent with regard to a command by [their] thinking that they have understood the reason that the Torah intended this command and that for this reason there is no need to observe this particular command.59 Here, a doctrine is considered one of the pinnot ha-torah not because of any hermeneutical issue but to safeguard the actual observance of the commandments. If men were to have com- plete knowledge of the reasons for the commandments, such knowledge would be used as a pretext for circumventing them.60 Still, most of the pinnot appear to function according to the original model set by Maimonides' discussion of creation. Most often, these doctrines are concepts that are so commonly ex- pressed in Scripture that the denial of them would threaten the intelligibility of its contents. The notion of free will, for in- stance, is necessary for making sense of the whole notion of divine command.61 It is also interesting to note which doctrines are not referred to as pinnot ha-torah in Gersonides' writings. The most notable exception is the doctrine of immortality. To my knowledge, Gersonides never refers to immortality as one of the pinnot 59 CT, p. 241c to. 5. The danger of rationalizing the commandments is expressed in Sanhedrin 21b and is also alluded to by Maimonides in Guide, 111:26, pp. 507-8. 60 Gersonides may have viewed the concepts of an everlasting and immuta- ble Torah as pinnot ha-torah for similar reasons. The two, however, are not synonymous. An everlasting Torah is merely one that will never be entirely revoked, while an immutable Torah is one that cannot undergo any change whatsoever. 61 See MH, p. 149; WL 2, p. 135; in this reference Gersonides is actually referring to the doctrine that there are contingent events in the world. Since the only contingent events are the result of free will, Gersonides' comments are effectively directed at this latter issue.</page><page sequence="19">[ 19] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT ha-torah, even though he reads several passages in the Bible - especially the Garden of Eden story - as referring to immortal- ity.62 Two of the more interesting pinnot are those which pertain to the messianic period: the Jews will be worthy of inheriting the land of Israel in the messianic age and all nations in that era will come to worship the God of Israel.63 Why do these function as pinnot ha-torah? Why is the intelligibility of Scripture tied up with the concept of a messianic era? It is beyond the scope of this paper to explicate fully Gersonides' position on the mes- sianic period. However, a discussion of these principles will not only clarify why Gersonides sees these doctrines as fundamen- tal biblical principles, but will also illuminate our subject as a whole.64 At the core of Gersonides' views on the messianic period is the notion that the messianic era is a fulfillment of the original promise to Abraham in Genesis 15 which specifies that the Jews will inherit the land of Israel. That is, the inheritance of the land was not successfully completed with the conquest of Joshua and only in messianic times will the Jews gain full possession of the land.65 In the course of his exegetical writings, Gersonides presents two pieces of evidence which indicate that Abraham's original prophecy was never fully realized. For one, God lists in the 62 See MH, pp. 438-9; CT, pp. 33a, 34a to. 18, 210a-b to. 11. 63 We will not discuss the notion of resurrection since its status is not clear. See note, supra, p. 19. 64 The following remarks are drawn from a more extensive discussion of the messianic period and its relationship to the covenant with Abraham which is contained in my dissertation, The Exodus of the Jews from Egypt in Gersonides' Commentary on the Torah, pp. 183-93. See also Kellner, Gersonides on Miracles, the Messiah and Resurrection, pp. 5-34. 65 We need not delve into the philosophical aspects of Gersonides' interpre- tation of the covenant with Abraham, although it is indeed an important issue for understanding his interpretation of the biblical history as a whole. See my dissertation for further discussion, ibid. 29</page><page sequence="20">30 ROBERT EISEN [20] original prophecy ten Canaanite nations which Abraham's descendants will conquer.66 Yet, this list is reduced to seven in Moses' speech to the Israelites in Deuteronomy just before their conquest of the land.67 One must therefore conclude that the Israelites' first conquest of the land in the time of Joshua was not the fulfillment of Abraham's prophecy.68 A similar argument is given from a biblical source regarding the cities of refuge. In Deuteronomy 19, Moses delineates the laws regarding the three cities of refuge which are to be a haven for those who have accidentally killed a fellow Israelite. After presenting these laws, Moses adds: And when the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land that He promised to give to your fathers - if you faithfully observe all this Instruction that I enjoin upon you this day, to love the Lord your God and to walk in His ways at all times - then you shall add three more towns to those three.69 It is clear, according to Gersonides, that the enlargement of territory and the establishment of three more cities of refuge can only refer to the fulfillment of the covenant which will occur in the messianic period. There is, after all, no mention in the prophetic writings of any new cities of refuge being added to the original three, and therefore this event must be one which is yet to occur. Moreover, it is clear that the coming of this messianic age is dependent on the Jews keeping God's commandments, since God specifically ties the extension of Israel's boundaries to the observance of "all this Instruction;" hence, the pinnah that the 66 Gen. 15:19-21. 67 Deut. 7:1. 68 Even in his original discussion of the Patriarchal covenant he mentions the messianic era in connection with the discrepancy between the number of Canaanite nations listed there and in Deuteronomy 7:1. See CT, p. 25b. 69 Deut. 19:8-9.</page><page sequence="21">[21] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT Jews will inherit the land of Israel in the messianic period if they observe God's commandments.70 There is other exegetical evidence which seems to have pushed Gersonides to the view that the messianic period is the fulfillment of the original covenant with Abraham. In several places, Gersonides has to explain the fact that in the Bible a covenant between God and the Jewish people continues to be referred to as a functional force even after the land has been initially conquered. For instance, in Deuteronomy 4:25-31 Moses informs the Jews that if they worship other Gods they will lose possession of the land. The text goes on to say that if the Jews then repent and are obedient to Him, the covenant with the forefathers will save the Jews and will help them regain possession of the land. Gersonides is therefore forced by bibli- cal evidence to account for the apparent extension of the covenant beyond the initial conquest. Accordingly, he inter- prets this passage as referring to the eventual fulfillment of the covenant in the messianic period, a covenant once again tied to the observance of God's commandments by the Jewish people.71 70 CT, pp. 226c, 227c to. 9, 227d to. 10. The phrase, "all this Instruction," in Deut. 19:9 is kol ha-mitsvah in the original Hebrew, a phrase which is taken by Gersonides to refer to the totality of the divine commandments. It should be noted that both pieces of evidence adduced here are not original to Gersonides. Other medieval and rabbinic sources see the conquest of the three remaining nations and the building of three more cities of refuges as events reserved for the messianic period. See Bereshit Rabbah, 44:23, vol. 1, pp. 445-7 and parallel sources in Albeck's notes; J.T. Hulin 32a; Nahmanides on Deut. 12:20 and 19:9; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Rotse'ah, 8:4. 71 CT, p. 209b. The reference to "the end of days" in Deuteronomy 4:30 is interpreted by Gersonides - along with other medieval interpreters - as an allusion to the messianic period. This passage in Deuteronomy is precisely the one quoted by R. Aha as a prooftext for his view that the merit of the Patriarchs will last forever (ibid.). See similar passages in Leviticus 26:42-5 (CT, p. 176b) and II Kings 13:23 (C. I Kings 25 to. 2) where Gersonides also uses the concept of a messianic period to deal with the apparent extension of the covenant. Gersonides also calls upon the covenant of the Patriarchs in 31</page><page sequence="22">It is therefore understandable why Gersonides sees the com- ing of the messianic period and its dependence on the obser- vance of the commandments as one of the pinnot ha-torah. Scattered throughout the Bible are numerous indicators that the covenant with Abraham is still waiting to be fulfilled through the Jewish people's obedience to God. Thus, the coherence of the entire biblical history is tied to this concept. One can also assume that Gersonides follows the rabbinic tradition in finding support for the notion of a messianic period in the celebrated passages of the Prophets which describe an idyllic future age. Evidence for this conjecture is that, when referring to the messianic period, Gersonides frequently cites Zephaniah 3:9, a typical passage of this kind.72 It is obviously from such sources that Gersonides formulates the other pinnah regarding the messianic era which refers to the prophecy that all nations will worship the true God.73 However, it is important to point out that Gersonides includes the messianic period among his pinnot ha-torah not just because of these popular references in the Prophets; evidence for the messianic age is drawn from the biblical history as a whole. What emerges from our analysis is that the pinnot ha-torah are doctrines which stand at the very interface between philoso- phy and revelation in Gersonides' thought. They are inviolable biblical principles which the philosopher must take into ac- count in the course of philosophical enquiry. order to explain God's favorable treatment of the Jews, even when there is no specific mention of the covenant in the biblical text. See, for example, C. I Kings 22 to. 15, C. II Kings 12 to. 3 and C. Esther, p. 46b to. 32. 72 CT, pp. 198b, 213d, 247a. 73 The classic passage for this idea is Isaiah 2:1-4. Gersonides, however, deduces the pinnah that the nations of the world will worship the God of Israel from I Chronicles 16:31. There are no extant commentaries by Gersonides on any of the Later Prophets. Therefore, how Gersonides uses these sources in formulating a position on the coming of a messianic period must remain open. A commentary on Isaiah appears to be lost. References to this commentary are in CT, pp. 197c, 227b; C. II Kings 19:25. 32 [22] ROBERT EISEN</page><page sequence="23">[23] THE PINNOT HA-TORAH IN GERSONIDES' THOUGHT Our major handicap in evaluating the place of the pinnot ha-torah in Gersonides' thought is that he provides little infor- mation about how they are derived and the function they serve in philosophical discourse. Nevertheless, we have been able to formulate some notion of this position on the basis of the evidence he provides in Milhamot ha-Shem and his exegetical writings. Most important in our investigation were conceptual and terminological parallels between Gersonides and Maimon- ides with regard to this issue. It would appear that Gersonides formulates his conception of pinnot ha-torah from Maimon- ides' discussion of creation. Gersonides' reliance on Maimonides may in fact explain why he provides so little theoretical information about the function of these principles. He may have simply assumed that all his readers were thoroughly familiar with the Guide and that they were all interpreting Maimonides precisely as he was. Gerson- ides may have regarded his own method of using the pinnot ha-torah in philosophical enquiry as an obvious extension of Maimonides' methodology set forth in the Guide, one that did not require further explanation. The major problem with the pinnot ha-torah is that the whole concept of a fundamental biblical principle is not well defined by Gersonides. For one, he does not spell out - nor does Maimonides for that matter - how basic a biblical concept has to be in order to qualify as one of the pinnot ha-torah.74 Certainly, little justification is needed to include the existence of God or the notion of prophecy as a fundamental principle of the Torah. These concepts permeate the entire body of Scrip- ture. However, the list of pinnot also includes a good many doctrines which appear to be nothing more than concepts that are commonly stated in the Bible. Does this mean that all concepts which are frequently mentioned in the Bible are pinnot ha-torah? Gersonides provides no criteria to distinguish 74 Hasdai Crescas was probably the first to have insight into this problem. For Crescas's conception of pinnot ha-torah, see Kellner, pp. 108-39. 33</page><page sequence="24">between concepts that are included under that rubric and ones that are not. A related problem is that there is no reason why the list of pinnot ha-torah could not potentially include just about any philosophical principle in Gersonides' thought. Recall that Gersonides sometimes includes as pinnot ha-torah those philo- sophical doctrines which lend support to central biblical con- ceptions even if they themselves are not fundamental to the Torah. Is there then any limit to the number of fundamental principles? Given the range of doctrines in the list of pinnot ha-torah, one could practically include any number of philo- sophical concepts that support one or another of these princi- ples. Yet, if all philosophical concepts can be included, the pinnot ha-torah effectively become so diffuse as to lose all meaning. Despite these problems, there are important conclusions to be drawn from our discussion which concern Gersonides' thought as a whole. First, our analysis demonstrates the impor- tant role which Scripture plays in Gersonides' philosophical thought, a point that has been too often neglected. There are no less than twenty-one fundamental principles of the Torah. If our theory is correct, these principles exert a decisive influence on Gersonides' philosophical positions and must therefore be taken into account for a full exposition of Gersonides' thought. Moreover, our discussion highlights the importance of Gerson- ides' biblical commentaries as resources for his philosophical views, another aspect of Gersonides' thought that has also received too little attention. As we have seen, the overwhelming majority of references to the pinnot ha-torah are contained in the biblical commentaries. In should be emphasized that our enquiry into the pinnot ha-torah is preliminary. We have attempted to delineate the general character of these principles, while demonstrating their potential importance. Only further research will determine the precise function of each of the various pinnot ha-torah in Gersonides' thought. 34 [24] ROBERT EISEN</page></plain_text>
