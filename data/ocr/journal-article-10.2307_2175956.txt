<plain_text><page sequence="1">HYLOZOISM: A CHAPTER IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF SCIENCE. TERIODS of transition, whether in the form of political revolutions or of epoch-making changes in speculative thought, awaken a large degree of interest in men of culture and science. In such transitions men see new eras in their making, and the time is filled with that life, movement, and change which are always wont to attract the gaze of spectators of the world's civilization. There is a hard struggle of the old with the new, and conservatives, with their orthodoxy, time- honored institutions and beliefs, yield the ground reluctantly to the advance of innovators and reformers. So the periods of enlightenment marked by the Sophists, the Italian Renaissance, and the Reformation are transition periods in the history of thought where we see the warring of opposing factions and sympathies filled with epoch-making influences. These eras are of greatest moment in the intellectual development of the world, and of proportional interest to the student of this devel- opment. A transition period of really greater importance for philosophy and science is the passage from the Animism of old Greece to the Hylozoism of the Ionian physiologers. It was here that science was born. The mythology and dualistic animism, though supported by the authority of the poets and bolstered up by religious veneration and respect for the ancient, which (to their praise be it said !) were always characteristic of the Greeks, had finally failed to satisfy the intellectual demands of this acute Ionian people. Philosophy, to be sure, did not spring suddenly into being, as Athena from Zeus's head. Natura nihil facit per saltum. Philosophy was developed in part out of the preexistent cosmology and mythology, though itself very different in spirit and method from these. The ancient Greek religion was essentially a religion of nature, wrought out and colored by fervid imagination and imbued</page><page sequence="2">HYLOZOISM. 395 with the poetry of nature-lovers, who filled earth, and sea, and sky with their myths, and made every forest and hillside spring pulse with life and soul. This belief of spiritual agency in nature, the hypothesis that the various objects of the natural world are animated with life, intelligence, and passion similar to man's, is at once the philosophy and religion of primitive culture. It is the earliest form of anthropomorphism, in which the unscientific mind saw in nature the analogue of itself. In the cruder aspects of animism amongst the lower races, 'stocks and stones' were made the objects of servile adoration and cringing fear; the spectres of their own imagination filled the worshippers, while the character of these embodied fictions had small poetic beauty. They betrayed no artistic creative- ness on the part of the people, but were the outcome of debas- ing fear of transcendental powers and of the desire to conciliate them, the spirit so despised by Epicurus and Lucretius. It is the ignorance, the conscious weakness and willing servility of the slave-mind. Yet even the philosophy of Epicurus and Lucre- tius, as Tylor, in Primitive Culture, points out, contains sur- vivals of a remote animism, though these authors were per- haps not conscious of the source from which these survivals came, or even of the fact that they were remnants of an archaic faith. The case in point is as follows: Democritus, from whom Epicurus derived his physical doctrines and theory of knowl- edge, supposes that things are constantly throwing off images of themselves (et'&amp;o\a). These images are transmitted by the medium of the air into the percipient soul and are thus cognized. This theory is a relic of the savage belief in object-souls, employed by Democritus in explaining the phenomena of per- ception. This resemblance is not merely superficial and fortui- tous. Democritus had often been witness of the funeral offerings of "garments, and jewels, and money, and food, and drink; rites which his mother and his nurse could tell him were performed in order that the phantasmal images of these objects might pass into the possession of forms shadowy like themselves, the souls of dead men."' Democritus thus trans- 1 Tylor, Primitive Culture, vol. i, p. 449.</page><page sequence="3">396 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. fers from religion, from a relic of primitive animism, to Epis- temology this conception of a thing's possessing a phantasm. Epicurus incorporated the same into his system. Lucretius makes the above theory of film-like images or phantasms (simulacra, quasi membranae summo corpore rerum dereptae, D. R. NV, iv, 35) explain the figures which appear to us in visions, and the images which enter our minds in sense-per- ception. We have here, then, an unbroken continuity in the evolution of thought from the crude animism that goes back to pre-historic Greece, down to the post-Socratic schools. Every modern civilization furnishes many examples of such survival from this animistic stage of culture, universal in the primitive world. The animistic belief took on various forms corresponding to the various national characters of which it was an expression. At the lowest stages of culture there is a belief that a ghost-soul animates man while in the body, and appears to others in dream and vision out of the body. The film-like soul passes out from the body as a shadow (oKLtd, ' shade') in sleep and death, and, superior to the ordinary con- ditions of time and space, goes where it will. Survivals of this notion have come down to ourselves in such phrases "as ' out of oneself,' 'beside oneself,' ' in an ecstasy,' and he who says that his spirit goes forth to meet a friend, can still realize in the phrase a meaning deeper than metaphor." I This conception in primitive thought of the relation of soul and body is decisive for the whole primitive view of nature. It is the soul that makes the difference between a dead body and a living one; it is the cause of life and thought and change. All nature was interpreted on this analogy. Wherever life and movement and agency were seen in the physical universe, they were explained as psychical law in the natural world. While the less creative and artistic races did not rise above animal, fetish, or totem worship, the Greeks in their polytheism -whose gods were only the various parts and forces of nature -constructed a pantheon harmonious and poetic, determining largely their imaginative literature, in 1 Tylor, Primitive Culture, vol. i, p. 397.</page><page sequence="4">No. 4.] HYLOZOISM. 397 which literature, too, the gods themselves find their only im- mortality. With them the sensuous and natural body forth the spiritual; their religion is a religion of nature. The spirits of the gods live in nature as personified causes, and this doctrine of the agency of personal spirits really gave way only at a com- paratively late stage of development to ideas of force and law. While certain aspects of animism have succumbed to other modes of thinking more adapted to new environment, some have persisted, and live not only in the classical age of Greece, but form part of our own intellectual inheritance from the remote past; e.g., the return of the spirits of the departed to present themselves to relatives, and the beliefs of the Spiritu- alists. The Greeks in the pre-scientific period possessed not only exuberant imagination, but childlike credulity. Criticism and investigation had not come into being. They believed thoroughly in the objective reality of the animistic fancies which formed their religion. They regarded with veneration and devoutness these deified forces and agencies in nature. Their religion and the manifold operations of divine powers working in the physical world were the naYve conceptions of personal will and passion projected into the realms of air and sea and sky. The world was resplendent with the beauty of their own youthful and joyous minds, and reacted in turn on the creating intelligence to make it a lover and worshipper of nature. Instead of saying Hercules purified a stagnant pool or lake of destructive miasmata, the mythopoeic fancy of the Greeks converted this into the story of Hercules de- stroying the Lernaean Hydra, and later generations believed in both monster and hero as realities. There are agencies which dominate the destinies of men as well as the phe- nomena of the physical world. The Parcae spin out for each man his thread of life; Ares presides over battle, and by his prowess helps the worthy to victory. Earth, heaven, and sea are filled with the personalities of Ge, Zeus, and Poseidon, who speak in the turbulent wave, the forked lightning, and the bounteous life of the land. The nymphs, the satyrs, Sileni, Pan, the local genii make the forest, the bubbling spring, the</page><page sequence="5">398 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. countryside echo with joyous life of sport; and while nature is thus vivified and adorned by imagination, it is to the Greek consecrated by faith. There is a certain animistic disposition in all poetry that deals with nature; ascriptions of language and feeling and will to the inanimate are common in our literature, unaccom- panied, however, by any religious aspect of such ascription, and conveying to the reader no suggestion that what is said is anything but a metaphor. When Wordsworth tells us of " The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on Murmuring so sweetly in themselves," or Coleridge that 44 The rivers sang in their channels; Laughed on their shores the hoarse seas; the yearning ocean swelled up- ward "; we see the universal tendency to interpret things animistically, to endue things with a soul, to find wherever there is move- ment and agency in nature an analogue to ourselves. One hears of 'whispering trees,' of 'sighing winds,' of 'nodding branches,' of ' frowning mountains,' of 'laughing meadow brooks,' in modern literature. But we no longer accompany this personification with any belief in its reality, and our elves, sprites, brownies, and woodland nymphs figure only as the most attenuated fictions in our fairy-books and child-lore. Such things no longer function in our thought as causes or explanations of natural phenomena. In the primitive world, however, and more especially in the pre-scientific Greek world, where imagination rather than thought determined belief, this animistic interpretation of natural phenomena served at once as religion and crude metaphysic. Out of this naturalistic religion was developed a naturalistic philosophy, which did not, however, do away with animism, but the mythology continued to exist for many generations alongside of science as the popu- lar religion. Even Socrates, after that long reverie of his in camp on the Potidaean campaign, offered a prayer to Helios, the sun-god, before going about his daily duties. Still the spirit and dogmas of science, from its very beginning, left no</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] HYLOZOISAI. 399 place for this mythology. It simply had the sanction of a long past, and had been the object of reverence on the part of gen- erations of ancestors; it was the popular religion, with which it was difficult to make open breach. As far as thought was concerned, apart from actual practice and ceremonial obser- vance, this breach was made in the Hylozoism of the Ionian physiologers. This is the beginning of the ' warfare of science.' Doubtless it was in the main the physical aspect of the current religion that did most to set astir amongst the Greeks the philo- sophical spirit. Mythology had sought a cause for changing natural phenomena, and discovered it in a personal will, a tran- scendental cause. Science sought an explanation of these natural changes, and found a natural cause. This is the point, one may unhesitatingly affirm, at which science first came into being. The transition here indicated is, therefore, the most important change which the history of intellectual development has to record. Hitherto there had been no recognition of the general interdependence of things, of any unity in the manifold, of any law determining the movement of natural phenomena. The old animism is a dualistic or double materialism. It con- ceives of two essentially different principles, matter and soul, but the latter is not immaterial. The film-like shade is as much matter as are the images in the philosophy of the mate- rialist Democritus, only it is a very different sort of matter from the non-psychical. The whole world is made up of two fundamentally distinct principles, soul and body, which never change over into one another, though they are both material or tangible entities. The conception of immaterial spirit is not yet reached, though the fundamental mode of thought in this primitive mythology is dualistic. Hylozoism, the form which the new stammering science assumes, is materialistic monism. This antagonism between animistic dualism and materialism is the most radical opposition in all religious thought. Through the Milesians nature was emptied of soul and of God. Alongside of this fundamental opposition between religion and materialism, which came to consciousness and expression with the Ionian phy- siologers, other oppositions, schisms, heresies, and diversities in</page><page sequence="7">400 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. creed sink into insignificance. For will and soul, force and life were substituted. There is a strongly marked interest in origins in the present age, dominated as it is by the evolution theory. Men desire to observe things and theories in their making, their growth. This applies equally to the development of philosophical ideas. We style society an organism, and we investigate philosophy genetically, carrying our observed forms and processes from the physical world into the non-physical, and finding that the same fundamental laws prevail here. We find that scientifi- cally the rude, but withal beautiful, animistic mythology is the protoplasm, as it were, from which speculative philosophy has been evolved. Early Greek speculation carries with it many marks of being autochthonous. Amongst these the two which are of greatest interest for our present purpose are the rela- tion in which the early Greek speculation stands to the mythol- ogy and religion then current, and secondly, the impress which a seaboard nature has left on the philosophy of these coast- dwellers. I am not concerned here primarily with the theory of the oriental origin of Greek philosophy or of certain aspects of pre-Socratic thought, a theory which does not appear to have lost ground in the last quarter of a century, but rather to have gained in favor. It is not, however, till we come to Heraclitus and the Pythagoreans that much evidence can be adduced in support of the oriental position, and even there it is subject to serious objections. For the early Ionians, the Mile- sian physiologers, no such dependency seems plausible. In the first place, their philosophy was intimately related to the mythology or religion then current (although in spirit and ten- dency radically opposed to this), besides being of so simple and naive a character that one must suppose it to be a first attempt. Thales, in adopting water as the ultimate element and the source of all life and movement, was doubtless influ- enced by the traditional theology. In the old mythology, as Aristotle points out, Oceanus and Tethys are the parents of generation, and water, under the name of Styx, was that by which the gods made oath. Now the object of the oath is</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.] HYLOZOISM. 401 that which is most respected, and the most respected is that which is most ancient and primary, i.e., the gods swore by water under the poetical designation of Styx, as something more ancient than themselves, the begetter of all things, the permanent, the underived. Aristotle therefore regards the philosophy of Thales as standing in intimate relation to the native mythology; in fact, as a conversion of the poetical forms and personifications of the ancient religion into philosophical statement. It is in so far a philosophical interpretation of the religion then in vogue. This principle of water, therefore, as the ultimate element in the universe would seem to show that the speculation of Thales was as indigenous as the current mythology. The difference between the mythological state- ment and the Thalean doctrine is, that the latter seeks to explain physical phenomena by physical causes; and so in break- ing away from the ascription of natural changes to transcen- dental powers, i.e., from the mythological view of the world, it becomes the first step in science. Oceanus and Styx are de-personified, and stand with Thales simply for the physical element, water, which was endued with life, an inherent and intrinsic attribute of matter, and not a separate principle. His claim to the title of founder of Philosophy, first given him by Tiedemann, is based on the fact that he announced a unitary principle to make the world process intelligible, and that from observation of the phenomena of animated nature he conceived the life-principle to be moisture. It was the first attempt to reduce to a single comprehensible principle nature's endless variety and detail. He looked upon the Aegean sea, teeming with its manifold forms of life; he observed the vivifying shower, the moist seed, the rising sap, the fluid blood, the meadow-life fed by the arteries of streams; and he said, this nature, pulsing with vital energy, is ultimately moisture. This is the begetter, the origin. Such a theory as this could not well have arisen elsewhere than in a physical environment like the Ionian coast, filled with ever-changing shore and sea life. Biologists nowadays tell us that the aquatic origin of life is a fundamental principle in Evolution. The physical influences,</page><page sequence="9">402 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. therefore, which gave form and coloring to the mythology of the early Greeks, determined also in some degree the character of their first speculative philosophy. These two things, then, the relation between the early religion and philosophy, and the impress which a coast nature has left on the latter, afford us incidentally strong evidence for the indigenous character of Hylozoism. In Anaximander the a'ietpov, i.e., unlimited, undifferentiated matter, is the Chaos of mythology and the poets. Particular things are in this potentially. This first principle (a term which Anaximander himself introduced into philosophy as copx-) is self-moved and living; it produces spontaneously all things out of itself. Like the other Milesians, he held a dynamical, in distinction from a mechanical, theory of nature, i.e., he proceeded on the assumption of a living energy which, by the transmutation it undergoes in spontaneous development, furnishes an explanation for the formal and qualitative distinc- tions of all generated things. The mechanical theory of physics, on the other hand, is later than the Ionian Hylozoism, and denies all actual generation, accounting for every formal and qualitative change by certain alterations in relations of space, as position or combination of material elements. It assumes that the material elements are fixed and permanent, but that change in position is competent to account for alter- ation in quality and form. This theory, though frequently referred to Anaximander, is not in keeping with the spirit of Hylozoism, which sees in nature a living force and regards its processes and continuous alterations as spontaneous develop- ments of life. The mechanical theory is developed later by Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and the Atomists. In the doctrine of Anaximander, the earth was at first in a liquid state, and by means of surrounding fires it was dried into its present con- figuration. Out of the primordial slime (in which Osborn, From tie Greeks to Darwin, sees the prototype of Oken's Ur-Schleim, though wrongly attributing the origination of the idea to Anaximenes), the manifold forms of animal and vegetable life are developed. Anaximenes returns to the standpoint of</page><page sequence="10">No. 4.] HYLOZOISM. 403 Thales, regarding everything as derived from one of the sen- sible elements. But instead of agreeing with Thales that the ultimate principle is water, Anaximenes regards it as air, and endows it with infinity, animation, and perpetual motion, - at- tributes derived apparently from the teaching of Anaximander. He looked on the world as a great living organism. Air is the principle of animal life; by inhaling and exhaling we live, and from this manifestation of vital function it was a very easy and natural step to bring inhalation and life into causal relation with each other. As air is the principle of being for us, so it is for the whole world. This ' breath of life' (both Wvevi4Ia and Alp are employed to designate it, Stob. Ecl. i. 296), however, which in man is the soul, is not conceived of as a world-soul, though this spiritual and pantheistic tendency, already visible here, becomes strongly marked in Heraclitus. Air, in the doc- trine of Anaximenes, is simply the atmospheric air, which by virtue of its mobility, its associations with life, and its wide diffusion, was fitted to be regarded as the substratum of the constantly changing phenomenal world. Rain, hail, fire, snow, and meteoric stones were to the untrained observer varied forms of atmospheric development. Unlike Thales, who re- gards the world as a sort of germination from a seed-state, and makes it thus an essentially vegetable process, Anaximenes looks upon the principle of production, air, as from all time perfectly developed; and makes the process of life analogous to that in a human being. The cause of change is in the eternal motion of the air; all qualitative change is due to motion. This motion assumes the form of opposite processes of con- densation and rarefaction, contraction and expansion, and this as a sort of eternal see-saw represents the manner of the world's development. These two processes are synonymous with heating and cooling, the qualitative correlates of quanti- tative changes in attenuation and condensation of air. Accord- ing to Diogenes, a follower of Anaximenes, plants and animals are developed out of the primordial slime abiogenetically under the influence of heat, and this doctrine is a further survival from the speculation of Anaximander. This Diogenes of</page><page sequence="11">404 THE PIIILOSOPII CAL REVIEWV. [VOL. IV. Apollonia held a theory similar to that of the Ionian Anaxim- enes, in regarding the world as a living organism, deriving its transformation from its own spontaneous vitality and self-initi- ated motion; further in making air the principle of life and the ultimate element. But he goes beyond Anaximenes in making this air a rational essence, the source of order in the universe, his fundamental aim being to explain the teleology and intellectual aspect of cosmical development. Mind and body, however, are not separated, but are still hylozoistically conceived as one material principle with certain rational attri- butes. We have the statement of Aristotle that none of the ancient physiologers, to whom Diogenes belongs, distinguished between matter and the moving cause. Anaxagroras, by the introduction of a transcendent noetic principle, was the first to separate the moving cause from the changing phenomena, and to proclaim a universe of mind and matter. This emphasis of the psychical principle in the universe, which we find becoming more and more pronounced in the Ionian physiologers down to Diogenes, is felt most strongly in the philosophy of Heraclitus. The principle of fire, which is the concrete correlate of the metaphysical notion of life, is for Heraclitus the ultimate essence. This is in constant mutation and activity; the world is a process. There is nothing sta- tionary, no fixed Being ; all is Becoming, and this is figured forth in the restless, mobile, altering, and consuming fire. There is an eternal movement, a perpetual oscillation in the world-process between winter and summer, night and day, cold and warmth, life and death, and all the manifold opposites and antinomies wherewith nature operates. The force determining this universal order is the universal reason (Votvos, Xoyos), which is identical with primitive fire, forming all things out of itself by the power inherent in it. Matter, and force or life, are not separated here. There is no absolute origination, but only development ; fire has no creative, but only transforming power. The dictum holds for all this hylozoistic philosophy: ex zihilo nihil fit. Truth is the absorption of self into the ground of reason, the universal fire, which is the source of</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.] HYLOZOISM. 405 illumination for both the physical and spiritual worlds. This has a sound as of the Mysteries, and so we find, too, that the philosophy of Heraclitus has a marked religious coloring, derived doubtless from his personal connection with the Or- phic and Dionysiac mysteries in his native city of Ephesus, - a city famous as a religious centre. The oscillating identity of life and death, or the doctrine that the various opposites pass over into each other and when viewed in the light of continued process are one, is only an interpretation of the statement: "Dionysus and Hades (i.e., Life and Death) are the same" (Fragm. I29. Cf Pfleiderer: Die Philosophie des Herak/it von Ephesus im Lichie der Mysterienidee, pp. 28, 78). The pan- theistic tendency of the Heraclitean system and its saturation with mysticism, make the partial derivation of his philosophy from the Orphico-Dionysiac mysteries not unlikely, while the perpetual movement and development in nature postulated by Anaximander and Anaximenes may possibly have some his- torical kinship with the doctrine of Flux, or eternal Becoming. However this may be, the philosophy of Heraclitus is hylozo- istic. The world-intelligence itself is part and parcel of the world-material and shares in the universal change and process. There is no idea of a transcendent reason, nor yet is the system a proper pantheism. The universal Logos is materialistically conceived (or at least expressed), and the system finds its proper classification, therefore, with the monistic philosophies of the Milesians. In the foregoing account of the development of hylozoistic theory, we find this most ancient expression of philosophic thought motived in part by affinity, in part by opposition to, religious belief, while in logical import it is essentially an- tagonistic to the latter. To philosophical energy there was doubtless greater stimulus in points of opposition than in those of affinity. Even Heraclitus, influenced as he is by the doc- trines of the mysteries, is at open war with the popular religion, and Thales conceives of an absolutely materialistic world in which there is no room for the religion of animism. Along with this breach between popular religion and science, one</page><page sequence="13">406 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. notices ever growing the confident tone of superiority in the latter, as reasoned truth, over the traditional religion. Hera- clitus looks with contempt on the vulgar mythology, and a little later we hear the vigorous denunciations of the reformer Xeno- phanes. The philosophy of Hylozoism as a naturalistic ex- planation of the world's development is near akin to the deliverances of sense; the elements which are exalted into metaphysical principles, e.g., water and air, are in the main observations of sense-perception. This philosophy begins, too, on the geographical outskirts of Greece. It is, as it were, 'peripherally excited,' while the more highly intellectual phi- losophy of the Socratic age is developed in Athens, the scientific and geographical centre of Greek civilization.
