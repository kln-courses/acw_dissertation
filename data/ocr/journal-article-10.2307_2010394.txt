E THNICITY as a distinctive field of multidisciplinary, comparative inquiry is clearly coming of age. Its growing maturity is well dem- onstrated by the three works considered here, particularly the major studies by Charles F. Keyes and collaborators, and by Joseph Rothschild. Other important new books, such as those by Milne' and Smith2 also illustrate a cumulating analytical sophistication in the comparative study of cultural pluralism. Not only is there now a large and increasingly rich monographic and conceptual literature on which to build, but an array of excellent journals have emerged in recent years, serving this realm of inquiry and providing it with a corporate identity of its own (or a veritable academic ethnicity): Ethnicity, Plural Societies, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Canadian Review of Studies of Nationalism, among others. Two decades ago, the subject was the exclusive preserve of sociology and anthropology, framed by the particular orientations of those disciplines. In industrial societies, the assimilationist perspectives of a Robert Park3 tended to predominate; elsewhere, cultural pluralism was pursued as ethnography. In recent years, the contributions of social psychologists, sociolinguists, historians, and political scientists have played an increasing role. These specialists have necessarily drawn heavily upon the work of sociologists and an- thropologists; in turn, the latter have adjusted their own paradigms to incorporate contributions from other disciplines. The new wave of ethnicity scholarship has reflected a comparative vocation. Rothschild, for example, is a specialist in Eastern European politics, and here projects his arguments upon a global canvas. Keyes's primary interest is in Southeast Asia, but in the work under review he assembles contributions of worldwide scope. Joshua A. Fishman, perhaps I R. S.

Scholarship concerned with the ethnic experience in the United States and with "nationality" issues in the Soviet Union has been dominated by those whose entire research effort has been confined within these given set- tings. To be persuaded of this point, it suffices to scan the footnote references and bibliographies appended to the major works concerning cultural pluralism in these two countries. The inarticulate major premise of the historical uniqueness of each of these states is ripe for challenge. The strength of the comparative thrust, and the awakened interest in ethnicity itself, are of course not simply intellectual trends, but re- sponses to observed reality. Few social scientists were lying in wait for the surge of communal politics that began in the i96os; indeed, for some time, most of them averted their eyes from this unseemly phenomenon, which defied the first set of postwar "modernization" paradigms. In the 1950s, when these new models-informed by invigorated methodologies and concepts-were constructed, the world was at an unusual con- juncture. In Asia and Africa, the unitary doctrines of anticolonial na- tionalism were still ascendant. Although the force of mobilized com- munalism was clearly shown in the tragic events attending the partition of India, such episodes appeared to be relatively isolated. Nationalism seemed to be the carrier of historical progress; the backward forces of "tribalism" and "communalism" would surely be conquered by the nationalist elites who had slain the larger dragon of colonialism. In the United States, the tremendous pluralization that had occurred through the massive immigration between the i88os and World War I had been stopped by the Immigration Act of 1924, which virtually closed the door to eastern and southern European groups. New immigrants had been subjected to powerfully assimilative pressures from the public school system, the nationalist doctrines associated with the two world wars, dominant social ideologies of Americanism, and rampant bigotry. By the 1950s, assimilationist doctrines had been largely accepted by the 4Fishman, ed., Language Loyalty in the United States (The Hague: Mouton, i966); Joshua A. Fishman, Charles A.

Oscar Handlin thus spoke for an age in celebrating the immigrants and their successful incorporation;6 so did Gunnar Myrdal in situating the Afro-American status in America as a problematic of integration.7 Glazer and Moynihan heralded a new era in their i963 assertion-jarring at the time, but utterly conventional today-that the "notion that the intense and un- precedented mixture of ethnic and religious groups in American life was soon to blend into a homogeneous end product has outlived its usefulness, and also its credibility."8 In Europe, the intense, aggressive, and often chauvinistic state na- tionalism of the first half of this century had driven those cultural collectivities that were not coincident with the dominant nationality to cover. In the wake of the two world wars, major surgery was performed to make states and nations congruent. Boundaries were redrawn, and large-scale population displacements and exchanges occurred. The mul- tinational conglomerates of Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans dis- appeared; Ireland became independent; in one way or another, large numbers of Greeks, Turks, Poles, Germans, Hungarians, Rumanians, Armenians, and Jews were moved, exchanged, expelled, or liquidated. While such evidently multicultural states as Yugoslavia, Switzerland, and Belgium survived, Europe in the 1950s seemed to have become a continent of unitary "fatherlands" to an unprecedented degree. The Bretons, Tyrolians, Basques and others who had been further submerged by this process were seen as quaint and folkloric survivals; those who voiced claims in their behalf were stigmatized as eccentrics and re- actionaries. In the Soviet Union, after a period of cultural flowering in the 1920S as the still precarious Bolshevik Republic sought to consolidate its power and win the commitment of non-Russian groups, Stalinist terror re- imposed unitary rule. "Nationalist deviation" was a passport to the gulag. The ruthless repression that characterized Stalinist state socialism ap- peared to "solve" the nationality question in the Soviet Union, if need be through mass deportations to Siberia and Central Asia.

When they reappeared-once the rigors of totalitarianism had been relaxed somewhat-there was surprise both inside and outside the Soviet Union that the I959 and 1970 censuses, which reintroduced nationality categories, revealed dramatic differen- tials in demographic trends between the low fecundity rates in European Russia and the high fertility in the Caucasus and Central Asian republics. Equally startling was the slender impact that the muscular promotion of Russian as linguistic medium for the socialist commonwealth had made in these regions.9 In Eastern Europe, Leninist nationality policy applied by Stalinist states seemed to suppress nationality politics effec- tively, even in the early years of Tito's rule in Yugoslavia. Thus, in the 1950s, all roads seemed to lead to national integration. Pathways might differ, but the end point was the same. The doctrine of "nation-building" reigned supreme. In any given country-to the extent that the cold, juridical concept of "state" remained only partly completed by the vibrant, living, anthropomorphic idea of the nation- dominant elites had within their grasp ideologies and strategies which would fulfill the requirement of nationality that seemed to emanate from within the sovereign state. The absence of ethnicity from the creative ferment of comparative politics, then, was not a product of the myopia of social science, but a reflection of the very low saliency of cultural pluralism at the time. With the wisdom of retrospection, we can now recognize how deceptive this apparent marginalization of the ethnic factor in politics was. Rather than an inexorable trend, the eclipse of cultural pluralism was a momentary conjuncture. The present conjuncture, in which all of the trends noted above have been reversed, may also be ephemeral. There are, however, solid reasons for believing that the new significance of ethnicity, race, and religion in social process and political conflict-which has become evident in the last quarter-century--does reflect longer trends. The various social proc- esses that are collectively labeled "modernization" are likely to result in heightened levels of cultural self-consciousness. Urbanization produces social arenas where cultural solidarity units provide many survival serv- ices to new migrants, where consciousness of competition for valued collective goods (mobility opportunities, employment, schooling) is much higher than in rural areas, and where daily encounters activate collective representations of self and other, we and they. The spread of education 9 Helene Carrere d'Encausse, L'empire iclati (Paris: Flammarion, I978).</page><page sequence="5">656 WORLD POLITICS brings previously isolated or inert strata within reach of cultural mo- bilization. Enlarged networks of communication have intensified aware- ness of social competition within national and regional arenas. The dramatic impact of the state, and the expansion of its role, raises the stakes of cultural competition. Transfer of allocations from the relatively impersonal domain of the market to the public realm of the state increases their visibility. Whether we are considering the post- industrial welfare state of the first world, the state socialism of the second, or the developmental statism of the third, the trend to state determination of resource distribution is similar. In turn, this trend makes the issue of domination more momentous: the cultural groups that are preeminent within the state apparatus are positioned to assure that the needs and interests of their communities are favored, and to impose their hegemony on others. By the i96os, the impact of these and other vectors of change were becoming fully apparent. It surfaced first in the third world once the intoxication of independence had subsided. That cultural politics would dominate such bipolar societies as Guyana, Malaysia, or Fiji should not have been surprising, though in the 1950s emergent lines of political conflict had even in these polities often been filtered through cold-war categorizations. In India, the crisis over linguistic states in the early 1950S, and the recognition of the electoral force of politicized caste associations in the second general elections in 1957, began to overshadow earlier political preoccupations with the significance of communist move- ments, as well as the prospects for development within a constitutional democratic framework. In Africa, civil wars in Nigeria, Sudan, and Zaire, and many other, lesser events demonstrated the volatility of po- liticized ethnicity. In the United States, the rise of the civil rights move- ment, the urban explosions of the i96os, and the emergence of militant movements asserting "minority" claims shattered the comfortable in- tegrationist presumptions of the 1950s. By the 1970s, cultural pluralism had become a potent factor in a number of Western states, as manifested by the meteoric ascent of the Parti Quebecois, the devolution debate and Ulster crisis in the United Kingdom, the progressive paralysis of Belgian political institutions, the difficult accommodation of regionalist demands of Catalans, Basques, and others in a democratic Spain. Among state socialist polities, Yu- goslavia moved to a virtually consociational form of Marxism-Lenin- ism;'0 Czechoslovakia after i968 conceded more autonomy to its Slovak 1o Dennison Rusinow, The Yugoslav Experiment I948-I974 (Berkeley: University of Cal- ifornia Press, i977).</page><page sequence="6">THE TEMPLE OF ETHNICITY 657 and Czech components. In the Soviet Union, the Russians' imminent loss of majority status in the total population, and the projected rise in Caucasus and Central Asian populations, predominantly Muslim, from 14 percent in 1950 to 30 percent in 2000 raises profound questions about the long-term viability of defacto Russian control of Soviet institutions. In dialectic response to these global currents of historical change, comparative ethnicity emerged as a distinctive field of social inquiry. A second generation of scholars engaged in the study of South Asian patterns began to concentrate on the cultural factor in politics and to build a corpus of theory of broad comparative significance; important in this group were the Rudolphs, Brass, Barnett, Das Gupta, Hardgrave, Nayar, Weiner, Jahan, and Phadnis, to mention but a few."

Illustrative of this trend, in the case of the United States, were the contentious works of Novak and Greeley'5 as well as the denunciations of the "new ethnicity" by such writers as Patterson and Steinberg.'6 Interest in the 20 to 25 percent of the U.S. population that had been involuntarily incorporated by conquest or forced importation (Native Americans, Blacks, Chicanos, and Puerto Ricans) and the strikingly diverse influx permitted by the immigration legislation of i965 generated a swelling literature after decades of relative invisibility.'7 A similar surge of contributions to an understanding of "ethnonationalism" in Western Europe appeared in the I970s; Birch and Esman are representative samples.'8 In the Soviet Union interest in the nationality issue also reemerged.'9 As monographic materials cumulated on various countries and re- gions, a significant comparative literature took form.

To start with, cultural pluralism is not simply a significant, but probably a growing factor in structuring social solidarities and collective images of political competition. Two major reasons have been suggested above: the linkage of communal consciousness to broader processes of modernization, and the continuing trend toward state ex- pansion. A third important finding is the dynamic and changeable char- acter of contemporary ethnicity; far from representing a fixed and im- mutable set of static social facts, cultural pluralism is itself evolving in crucial ways, and is in major respects contextual, situational, and cir- cumstantial. A fourth inference is the central impact of the political process in giving shape and content to ethnicity; cultural collectivities are not simply disembodied primordial givens, but contingent patterns of solidarity whose activation depends upon the organization and mo- bilization of consciousness on the one hand, and the intrusion of the political process in the form of perceived domination, competition, threats, or advantages, on the other. That is the essential theme of the Rothschild study, which suggests a well-conceived framework for comprehension of the dynamic of politization of ethnicity. Finally, the sheer complexity of the ethnic phenomenon has become better recognized. Cultural plu- ralism is not reducible to a parsimonious handful of conditioning factors; its operation in a particular setting depends upon a wide array of his- torical, social, economic, cultural, and psychological factors. There is thus a high degree of indeterminacy in specific outcomes; the Swedish York: Monthly Review Press, i980); Mario Barrera, Race and Class in the Southwest (South Bend: University of Notre Dame Press, I979). 24 Alvin Rabushka and Kenneth A.

Race may be of high saliency in the United States but of much lower visibility in the Do- minican Republic. Ethnicity may be crucial in Uganda but relatively unimportant in Tanzania. One major line of cleavage that has become apparent in comparative ethnicity in recent years separates analysis into "instrumentalist" and "primordialist" camps. Keyes has made imaginative use of this polarity to structure much of the discussion in the volume under review. The contrast between the approaches was indeed evident from the early days of ethnicity as a discipline, when two seminal articles, which may be said to have inaugurated comparative ethnicity as a field, staked out opposite positions: Wallerstein, as the practitioner of "instrumental- lsm,"26 and Geertz, as the patron of "primodialism."27 The instrumen- talists view ethnicity essentially as a weapon in the pursuit of collective advantage. They stress the situational and circumstantial nature of ethnic solidarity, and focus upon competition and interaction.28 The primor- dialists stress the assumed givens of shared culture as the heart of the ethnic matter. Keyes argues, in a useful metaphor, that ethnic identity may be seen as a gyroscope which oscillates in particular content, form, and boundaries over time, but still retains a central core or point of reference (pp. 3-28). Other examples of a primarily primordialist ap- proach are recent works by Isaacs and Epstein.29 For the observer who wishes to sample the field of comparative ethnicity from a single volume, there is no better place to begin than Keyes. A veritable monument to successful collegial effort, the work possesses an intellectual coherence and consistency of quality rarely found in edited collections. Without doubt, this unusually high level of common discourse may be attributed to the organized, interdisciplinary dialogue on comparative ethnicity that has been carried on at the University of Washington since 1972; in 1976, a special issue of Ethnicity carried an earlier collective product of this group. Keyes and several of the con- tributors are present or past participants, as are such other major in- 26 Immanuel Wallerstein, "Ethnicity and National Integration," Cahiers d'Etudes Africaines 3 (October 1960), I29-39. 27 Clifford Geertz, "The New Integration Revolution: Primordial Sentiments and Civil Politics in New States," in Geertz, ed., Old Societies and New States (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, i968). In this pathbreaking statement, Geertz in fact employs "instrumentalist" per- spectives as well as contributing a "primordialist" vocabulary. Nonetheless, the article is frequently interpreted as stressing the cultural "givens" of ethnicity. 28 For an extreme version of the instrumentalist position, see Patterson (fn. i6). 29 Isaacs (fn. 5); A. L.

Instrumentalism, primordialism, and change define the problematic for individual contributors. Ethnicity has both instrumental and pri- mordial dimensions; the authors explore the relative weight of these two dimensions and seek out the factors in ethnic change. Michael Banton examines the conditions for assimilation, and demonstrates that this outcome, where it occurs, is a far more complex, multifaceted process than was once assumed. Ivan Light considers the phenomenon of ethnic succession in societies where immigration has been important, and arrival sequential. He shows that succession, as a steady upward movement of status-ranked ethnic communities into niches vacated by those above them, occurs only in periods of labor scarcity. Succession, he argues, is only one of several possible outcomes; others include displacement, leap- frogging, and enhancement or deterioration of an existing niche. Three particularly sensitive and enlightening case studies are con- tributed by Judith Nagata, Carter Bentley, and Mark Tessler. Nagata masterfully delineates ethnogenesis among the Malay; "the category of Malay," she maintains, "has been built up by a gradual series of aggre- gations from a variety of other peoples who still sometimes assert their separate identity" (Keyes, I03). Bentley, in a deft and elegant analysis, reveals the layering of identities among the "Moros" of the Sulu archi- pelago in the Philippines. Shared commitment to Islam lightly covers the sharply ranked ethnic statuses that separate Tausug, Samalan, and Bejau. Tessler shows a fine hand in interpreting survey data collected among Jewish communities in Tunisia and Morocco, and among Arabs in Israel, to sketch a convincing portrait of ethnic change. The ancient Jewish communities in the two Maghreb states are clearly on the path to oblivion; in Tunisia, the critical mass for sustaining the communal mechanisms needed for identity preservation, socialization, and main- tenance of group life is virtually lost, and a comparable trend is apparent in Morocco. Among Israeli Arabs, the opposite holds true: a clear emer- gence of a much more active, assertive collective consciousness as "Pal- estinian." The sharpening antagonisms between Arab populations and Israeli authorities that have recently become so visible are clearly fore- shadowed in the Tessler data. Rothschild builds upon his regional specialization in Eastern and Central Europe to offer a wide-ranging and erudite essay on the con- ditions for political activation of ethnicity in the contemporary world. In aligning himself with the instrumentalists in his approach, he does</page><page sequence="11">662 WORLD POLITICS not intend to contradict the primordialists; analysis of the cultural and psychological dimensions, he suggests, may be left to other hands. He examines ideologies of cultural consciousness, leadership, the impact of the state, and the international implications of ethnicity mobilized. The Stack collection, while useful, is not of the same caliber as Keyes and Rothschild. Its ambition is laudable: to capture the international dimension of ethnicity. Its framing concept is "transnationalism," a term that achieved household status through Keohane and Nye.30 Few would dispute the proposition that non-state actors, among them ethnic col- lectivities, are significant factors in international politics. Some moder- ately promising ideas are encountered in the introductory essay in which the editor argues that the "transnational ramifications of ethnicity" have sharply increased since World War II (p. 7). "Transnational" proves to be such a loose concept in its application by the sundry contributors, however, that its analytical utility vanishes. We find it employed to describe the intrusion of nationalism into in- ternational sports competition, Islam and Arabism as "transnational" forces bearing upon national identity in Saudi Arabia, the impact of Black American militancy in the uncertain and halting move of Afro- Brazilians toward greater racial consciousness, and the role of the Greek- American lobby in constraining American security links with Turkey. Taken individually, these pieces are of some interest, but collectively they do not add up to a coherent statement. The challenge of elucidating cultural pluralism as a component of international politics thus remains. So does the task of setting forth a comprehensive, general theoretical formulation of the interaction and mutual determination of state, class, and ethnicity. Rothschild and Keyes and his collaborators have advanced us toward that goal. The vitality of comparative ethnicity as a field, exemplified in these studies, provides reason for hope that more powerful paradigms may be in prospect in the years to come. 3? Robert 0.
