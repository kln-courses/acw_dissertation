<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROBLEMS OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE, by Terence Penelhum. Macmillan, 1971. £2.80. CONTEMPORARY CRITIQUES OF RELIGION, by Kai Nielsen. Macmillan, 1971. £2.80. Each of these books is a worthy addition to a series which has already started well. Penelhum is most fair and judicious, able to see both sides of the case of religious belief and unbelief to a degree given to very few authors. Nielsen only sees one side of the case, and is, in his way, all the more readable for that. Nielsen attacks a view rather fashionable among contemporary philosophers, which sees religion as a kind of island of discourse and behaviour, susceptible neither to attack nor to defence by considerations drawn from philo- sophy or the sciences. He argues that the religious believer is either committed to a naïve anthropomorphism in his discourse about God, or has subtilized and etiolated his</page><page sequence="2">New Blackfriars 526 'belief' until it is void of objective meaning. This the techniques of contemporary philosophy can show; hence the effect of philosophy, far from leaving everything as it is, is destructive of religion. I believe most of the arguments of the book either to be invalid, or to be based on false premisses; but their presentation is both entertaining and skilled. Thus the book may be heartily recommended to philosophical believers as an object on which to sharpen their knives. Penelhum's book has much to say on a point which is, I should say, not sufficiently adverted to by Nielsen; that it is very difficult to philosophize about religion without begging the question of belief one way or the other. The unbeliever is apt to set up his theory of know- ledge in such a way that God is bound to be excluded from the possible objects of intelligible discourse, while the believer will do just the opposite. The traditional forms of argument for God's existence would appear, according to this author, to be invalid; nevertheless, there seems no rationally compelling way of making nonsense of the theist's claim that God reveals his nature and purposes to believers through certain significant events in nature and history.
