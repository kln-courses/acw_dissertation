<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OBSERVANCE OF ALL SOULS' DAY IN THE GUINEA-BISSAU REGION: A CHRISTIAN HOLY DAY, AN AFRICAN HARVEST FESTIVAL, AN AFRICAN NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION, OR ALL OF THE ABOVE(?)* George E. Brooks Indiana University "[A] desecration of our religion."' I On the eve of All Saints' Day on November 1i, 1898, a Portu- guese army officer, Henrique Augusto Dias de Carvalho, observed a colorful and noisy crowd of people wending through the streets of Bolama beginning the celebration of dia dos finados (All Souls' Day), which day of supplication for the faithful departed is ob- served by Christians on November 2. The indigenous Christians generally from long- standing custom and according to local practices cus- tomarily pay homage to the dead on the second day of November, beginning this commemoration on the eve of All Saints' Day after midnight. They come out of their dwellings and gather at the door of the local church whence they proceed with little lights walking in procession through all the streets singing the Ave-Maria mixed with African songs. Men and women with fantastic costumes, as if it were carnival, and swigging aguardente and palm wine wander about for three entire nights in this manner until after daybreak; then they disperse, everyone re- turning to their dwellings, to come out again at night, and spending all day on the 2nd in singing and dancing. The groups combine this with alcoholic drinks and en- gage in lewd behavior, which debauchery attains its peak during the night of the 2nd until dawn, when af- ter several hours of rest, the finale of the commemor- ation takes place, which consists of feasting and more drinking, inside or in the open air at a place some distance from the settlement, afterwards singing once again Ave-Marias for the souls of all the departed.2 HISTORY IN AFRICA, 11(1984), 1-34</page><page sequence="2">2 GEORGE E. BROOKS Dias de Carvalho relates that he was disgusted by the car- nival-like atmosphere which seemd to him to desecrate "our re- ligion," causing him to remonstrate to a watching priest that such irreverent and scandalous goings-on should not be permitted. The priest, C6nego Serpa Pinto, demurred, replying that he lacked authority to interfere in such matters, that the observance of All Souls' Day by a procession was an old custom in Guinea, that such proceedings in no way challenged colonial authority, and that he was wary of interfering with such observances lest he create discord among members of the Christian community. Dias de Carvalho does not record what rejoinder, if any, he made to these sensible remarks, only adding that Portuguese authorities deferred taking action against such processions until 1904, end- ing "such absurdities" on Bolama. The individual who persuaded the Administrador of Bolama to prohibit the customary celebra- tion was C6nego Serpa Pinto.3 Conego Serpa Pinto characterized the celebration of All Souls' Day as a "longstanding custom," causing one to wonder when and in what circumstances this particular Christian holy day began to be celebrated in the Guinea-Bissau region. Such are intriguing questions, for there was only sporadic missionary activity in the area prior to the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Until then, Cacheu, Bissau, and other Portuguese gar- risons frequently lacked chaplains for months or years at a time, and the few priests sent to Guinea seldom concerned themselves with missionizing neighboring African societies. Moreoever, the Portuguese, Cape Verdean, and Luso-African traders, officers, and soliders who lived in Guinea were generally reputed to be neglectful of their religious obligations, even scandalously so. Few attended mass, observed holy days of obligation, or conse- crated Christian marriages. What then made the celebration of All Souls' Day so significant for residents of the trading com- munities in Guinea, especially for the "indigenous Christians?" A tentative answer is that European observance of All Souls' Day on November 2 and All Saints' Day on November 1 "for- tuitously" coincided with the time African societies celebrated harvest time and the beginning of the new year, thereby predis- posing Africans to espouse a European festival at a similar time of year. More speculatively, and on a deeper level of analysis, Portuguese and Africans shared a similar heritage of "pagan" be- liefs that antedate the spread of Christianity to either Europe or West Africa, which shared heritage encouraged mutual accommo- dation, acceptance, and syncretism of religious beliefs and prac- tices. The discussion following explores a point of view diametri- cally opposite that of Dias de Carvalho and nineteenth-century Europeans generally: that is, instead of contrasting and deni- grating what Africans do differently than Europeans and disparag- ing them for their inadequacies in imitating European "civilized" models, this paper focuses on similarities and compatibilities among African and Portuguese religious beliefs and practices. What is adduced is, inevitably, exploratory and tentative given the paucity of scholarly investigation of these matters, but sug-</page><page sequence="3">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 3 gestive nonetheless of the possibilities of new lines of inquiry.4 II The 'Pagan' Heritage of Medieval Portugal In recent papers, I have posited the appropriateness of a conceptual framework that treated Old World Neo- lithic Religions as a single continnum.5 Dias de Carvalho would have been appalled to learn how "our religion" was practiced by Portuguese in medieval times, contin- uing in some areas down to the present century. The Catholic Church engaged in a long struggle to eradicate or co-opt "pagan" beliefs and practices surviving from pre-Christian times. In particular, it proved extremely difficult to suppress pagan fes- tivals linked to the change of seasons and the cycle of agricul- tural patterns followed by cultivators. Much syncretism with Christian beliefs occurred as a consequence. Church authorities' adoption of All Saints' and All Souls' days as Christian holy days of obligation are striking examples of Europeans' tenacious adherence to pre-Christian beliefs. All Saints' and All Souls' days derive from ancient beliefs associated with a pagan festival of death following harvest time and the onset of winter. Church authorities found such beliefs impossible to extirpate, and in the ninth century November 1 was officially established on the Church calendar as a day of obli- gation honoring all saints, known and unknown. Divorced of its religious significance, "Halloween" (All Hallows) continued to be celebrated on October 31 as an outlet for youthful exuberance, pranks, and merry-making of all sorts.6 In the eleventh century the Church established November 2 as All Souls' Day, a day of supplication for souls in Purgatory. Souls of the faithful which at death have not been cleansed from venial sins, or atoned for past transgressions, can be helped to attain heaven by prayer and the sacrifice of the mass.7 It is noteworthy that the Church accorded special privileges to Christians in the Iberian peninsula, testifying to the tenacity of old beliefs among Portuguese and Spanish. In 1748 Pope Bene- dict XIV granted a special dispensation to Portuguese and Span- ish priests to celebrate three requiem masses for the repose of departed souls on All Souls' Day, conferring special indulgences on souls in purgatory, a dispensation not accorded to Christians in other countries until 1915.8 In like manner, the feast of Christmas supplanted another pagan festival marking the winter solstice (December 22) and the rebirth of the sun. And the Easter festival of death and resur- rection replaced the pagan festival celebrating the return of spring and the renewal of nature.9 Moss and Cappannari character- ize the early missionary bishops as "good applied anthropologists</page><page sequence="4">4 GEORGE E. BROOKS [who] realized that new ideas are more readily accepted if they can be made compatible with the existing culture." In the year 601 A.D., Pope Gregory I (Gregory the Great) wrote as follows to his priests...who were at- tempting to convert the heathen Britons--and were not making much progress: "We must refrain from destroying the temples of the idols. It is necessary only to destroy the idols, and to sprinkle holy water in these same temples, to build ourselves altars and place holy relics therein. If the construction of these temples is solid, good, and useful, they will pass from the cult of demons to the service of the true God; because it will come to pass that the nation, seeing the continued existence of its old places of devotion, will be disposed, by a sort of habit, to go there to adore the true God."'I The Church's expropriation of pagan festivals did not com- pletely dam the wellsprings of pagan beliefs, which long remained widespread in western Europe. At first, all images were banned, but the Church had to accommodate popular wishes and traditions. When Christian images were at last allowed, some very ancient images, sometimes uncouth, were miraculous- ly discovered in unfrequented spots (woods, caves, etc.) where the pagan peasantry had hidden them. The clergy blessed these images under Christian names and often built temples for them just where they had been found. According to the local legends, the images refused to stay put in the parish church. In fact, the clergy re- garded them with suspicion. Pilgrimages began, distinct from regular worship at the orthodox church. The most famous of these images were black." The color black, symbolic of the earth, was associated with pagan fertility goddesses and found widespread expression in Christian Europe with "black madonnas."12 Celebration of All Souls' Day is of particular significance with respect to pagan survivals in Europe: Certain popular beliefs connected with All Souls' Day are of pagan origin and immemorial antiquity. Thus the dead are believed by the peasantry of many Catholic countries to return to their homes on All Souls' night and partake of the food of the living. In Tirol cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In Brittany the people flock into the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel bare-headed at the graves of their loved ones, and to fill the hollow of the tombstone with holy water or to pour libations of milk upon it, and at bedtime the supper is left on the</page><page sequence="5">Guinea-Bissau Region NIO A SGassan Karentaba* Barrakunda.

BROOKS table for the soul's refreshment.13 The pagan festival of death in the fall linked to a second festival in May marking the return of spring and the renewal of nature survived in parts of Portugal until the present century, with people in some districts visiting church graveyards on May Day as well as All Souls' Day.14 With respect to Portuguese ob- servance of All Souls' Day, Rodney Gallop remarks, Two features of the dia dos finados reflect its pagan origin. One is the magusto or open-air feast of wine and chestnuts...probably consumed originally on the graves and undoubtedly connected with funeral offerings. The other is wassailing by bands of children. Round Coimbra these sing loas (hymns). At Belas and Obidos they ask for pao por Deus (bread for God), a forgotten echo of a traditional charitable distribution, provis- ion for which was made in certain fifteenth-century leases. At Cintra there is a tradition that nothing that a child asks on this day may be refused. The Carollers are rewarded either with a magusto or with boZas de festa, special cakes of sugar, cinnamon and sweet herbs.15 It may be noted that open-air feasting and caroling were salient features of the All Souls' Day observance at Cacheu described by Dias de Carvalho. Gallop compiled a wealth of information concerning pagan beliefs and practices that survived in Portugal down to the twentieth century. These include "a belief that certain malign influences have special power at Halloween and Christmas. It is not witches, mouras or werewolves however, who are abroad on these two nights. Their place is taken by the souls of the dead, alminhas a penar."16 Gallop added: In Portugal, at the present day [1930s], the alminhas appear to be not so much feared as welcomed. Crumbs are scattered for them on the hearth, or the table is left spread after the consoada [Christmas banquet in the small hours of Christmas Day], in or- der that they may share in its plenty. If they are seen, it is only in the form of little flickering lights. But in the Minho, they come only if no pray- ers are offered for their peace, and in these prayers it is easy to discern the intention of warding them off. In most primitive communities, the dead are feared little less than witches. Numerous as they are in many countries, the customs in which fear and avoidance are tempered by affection and combined with a ritual aiming at ensuring the return of the dead to their ancestral homes on one day in the year are the exception rather than the rule.</page><page sequence="7">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 7 In so far as they are feared, therefore, the souls of the departed may be equated with the malign beings in whom popular superstititon has incarnated pagan nature cults. It is possible that this parallel may prove to be even closer. In the Portuguese calendar the cult of the dead is reflected in other customs which I have not yet described. During Lent, groups of men and women go round the villages late at night and chant the Dies Irae or dirges calling upon all good Christ- ians to awake and pray for the souls of the dead. This is called aumentar or encomendar as almas. Round Mir- anda do Douro the song begins: Acordai, pecadores, acordai, Awake sinners, awake and nao dormais mais; sleep no longer; Olhai que estao ardendo em Remember the souls of your chamas as almas dos fathers who burn in vossos pais flames Que vos deixaram os bens e Who left their property to vos deles nao vos lem- you who remember them brais. no more.17 Gallop discussed three examples of "ancient and primitive conceptions" concerning the dead which are found in Portugal and elsewhere: "that a corpse is ceremonially unclean and this uncleanness extends not only to the dead man's belongings but also to members of his family; that the dead envy and persecute the living; and that the presence of death endangers the lives of those around."1 Gallop also remarked: In all ages, a relation has been thought to exist between the dead and the buried seed from which pres- ently the crops will spring. The fact that both dis- appear beneath the earth would alone suffice to account for this notion, which is reflected in the myths of Ancient Greece and Rome and in the Greek festival of the Anthesteria... In Portugal the dead are associated with seed, flour or bread in several of the customs mentioned in this chapter; in the crumbs they eat at Christmas, in their intrustion on the maize stripping and in the fact that in some districts the aumentar as almas is practiced on the threshing floor. In the terras de Barroso it is customary, if one drops a crust on the floor, to exclaim: Para as alminhas (for the souls). If, therefore, the dead may be regarded as the guardians of the buried seed and their cult be inter- preted as an agricultural fertility cult, the distinc- tion between them appears to dissolve into thin air. No longer does it seem to matter whether the wassail- ers are to be conceived as harbingers of luck or as the wild-hunt of the dead, since in either event the</page><page sequence="8">8 GEORGE E. BROOKS prosperity of the crops is their aim. If not identi- cal in outward form witches and ghosts are equivalent in so much as both are misty personifications formed in frightened peasant minds by the old rites and their protagonists, divinities once, who have paled to-day into these shadowy creatures of evil.19 Gallop's conclusion that the dead may be regarded as the "guardians of the buried seed and their cult be interpreted as an agricultural fertility cult" is congruent with West African beliefs that ancestral spirits serve as intermediaries with the spirits of the soil to ensure bountiful harvests, good health, and increase for humans and domestic animals. Gallop elsewhere expatiated on the beliefs of Portuguese and other Europeans concerning the cult of vegetable fertility. The most obvious symbol of the spirit of vegeta- tion, and one which survives in our own Maypole, is the tree. When the animistic belief that every tree is the body of a separate spirit leads to the polythe- istic conception of a general tree spirit which can take up its abode in any particular tree, a stage is reached in which trees, considered as animate beings, are credited with the power of making fruit and crops prosper, herds multiply and women bring forth easily. When, in turn, anthropomorphism displaces polytheism, the same powers are attributed to tree gods conceived in the likeness of mankind. Both these stages are reflected in Portuguese folk-usage, derived originally from rites in which the tree spirit was conceived as immanent in the tree, as detached from it and represented in human effigy, and finally as emboided in living men and women.20 One example discussed by Gallop concerns a chapel at Merceana where a herdsman, observing his ox repeatedly fall upon its fore- legs before a tree, looked into the branches and saw a vision of the Virgin with the dead Christ in her arms. Rodney comments that the legend derives from an ancient cult of the oak tree and the bull, "emblems respectively of the gods of Thunder and War," and notes that an identical explanation is traditionally given for a similar shrine in Spain.21 West Africans likewise identify trees as a favored abode of spirits, the most powerful spirits arrogating the largest trees. Stones, streams, springs, and other bodies of water are also dwelling places of spirits in West Africa, and in Europe. Gallop commented on pilgrimages to shrines that date to pre- Christian times. Everywhere, traces of a cult of stones and rocks survive in the nomenclature of holy images. Senhoras da Rocha, da Penha, do Penedo, da Serra, da Lapa, and so on, abound. These shrines of Our Lady are usually</page><page sequence="9">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 9 situated on some crag or rock, or near some cave or "rocking" stone, which struck the imagination of the ancient Lusitanians and was worshipped or populated with Mouras Encantadas. For example, Na Snra da SaUde at Penha Longa, where a big romaria is held in May, stands at the foot of a low spur of the Cintra range, culminating in a sharp pinnacle of rock, and the chapel of the Senhor da Serra at Belas just out- side Lisbon is close to the remains of a striking dol- men. That in other places the worship of Our Lady has superseded the cult paid to the tutelary spirits of springs and wells, is indicated by the fact that at Na Snra da Atalaia in the Ribatejo, Na Snra da Piedade at Goim near Lamego, and many other shrines, a spring of pure water bubbles up under the very altar of the church.22 "Mouras Encantadas" (enchanted Mooresses) are believed to be beautiful maidens who may have a snake's tail instead of legs, are guardians of treasures, and possess other marvelous attri- butes. Mouras require human aid to break their enchantment, and Gallop noted that in many legends describing encounters with humans, they are often portrayed in serpent forms.23 Near Vermoim in the Minho, runs one such tale, there was once a serpent which struck fear into the hearts of all around. A young man who went forth to slay it fell asleep during his quest. The serpent kissed him while thus he slept, and was transformed into a beauti- ful maiden whom he married. More usually it is the mortal who must kiss the serpent....24 Europeans and West Africans share an enormous corpus of legends recounting variants of snake/dragon, young man, and maiden rela- tions, usually with one of the three perishing in the encounter.25 Specific to snakes, West Africans believe the python (Python se- bae) to have remarkable attributes. It is associated with the powerful spirit Ningiri which dwells in the earth, in water, and in trees, consumes iron which it transforms into gold, links the sky as the rainbow, and controls rain.26 Just as the python (and the spirits living in trees, rocks, etc.) possess certain powers, so do Christian saints have "spheres of influence": S. Antao is the patron of cattle, S. Dionfsio guards against earthquakes, S. Gongalo is a matchmaker for women, etc., etc. Portuguese peasants attribute saints with human vir- tues and human frailties. Saint Pedro de Rates, for example, has a reputation for revengefulness. "On his day not a soul would dare work throughout the Minho, for o santo " vingativo, and some misfortune would certainly befall them.27 Gallop further remarked: If the Saints are regarded as human beings it nat-</page><page sequence="10">10 GEORGE E. BROOKS urally follows that they are treated accordingly. They may be cajoled and their intervention obtained by prayers and penitence, by vows and votive offer- ings. But if they fail to accomplish what is desired of them they are exposed to menaces and, in the last resort, to punishment. I am informed that it is by no means unusual, even in good families, for recalci- trant Saints to be turned with their faces to the wall like so many naughty children.... Of S. Antonio the matchmaker, an English observer wrote just over a cen- tury ago that "if things wear a prosperous aspect his image is honoured with a quantity of tapers; but if the contrary be the case he becomes liable to the grossest possible indignities, and I have even known him plunged into places where his situation must have been anything but pleasant. It is not with lovesick maidens alone that S. Antonio has often to repent of his too extensive reputation; for mariners, who have prayed to him in vain for propitious breezes, at length lose patience and flog his effigy lashed to a mast.... At Nazare there is a statue of the Virgin which, if a storm arises, is threatened, and, if any disas- ter occurs, publicly cursed. The women of Povoa de Varzim are popularly reputed to stone the Saints and smash the chapel windows if they allow the fishermen to be drowned at sea. The luckless St. Anthony figures in what is per- haps the most curious of such stories. "The people of Castelo Branco", wrote Brydone in his Tour Through Sicily and Malta [in 1770] "were so enraged at S. An- tonio for allowing the Spaniards to plunder their town, contrary, as they affirmed, to his express agree- ment with them, that they broke many of his statues to pieces; and one that had been more revered than the rest, they took the head off, and clapped on one of St. Francis in its place, whose name the statue ever after- wards retained." The Constituigoes of the See of Evora, published in 1534, impose penalties on the practice of carrying images to water in time of drought and threatening them with immersion if they do not bring rain. In some parts of the country this practice still survives, the victims being S. Miguel in the district of Vila Real, S. Antonio in that of Braganza, and Santa Marinha at Segura (Beira Baixa).28 Portuguese would find similar practices in West Africa. Portuguese and West Africans likewise shared similar beliefs concerning the causes and cures of disease, and in the efficacy of amulets. In past times in Portugal, illness was conceived as caused by a spirit or a soul from another world. In 1932 a woman vidente (seer) named Zefa explained her cures as follows:</page><page sequence="11">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 11 Disease, she states authoritatively (and Carregueiras [her village] in the main agrees with her), is a spir- it. It is the spirit of some deceased member of the patient's family. When a patient consults her, Zefa does not enquire whether he has fever, headache, pal- pitations or a stomach-ache. She simply asks: 'Whom have you lost?' 'My father', replies the patient. 'Then that's what ails you', is Zefa's dogmatic pro- nouncement. And she adds: 'I will communicate with his spirit, and you will recover.' This she does, or so both Zefa and the patient maintain. And the pa- tient is cured. At least, Zefa says so, and the pa- tient says so too.29 In the circumstances, Portuguese provided themselves with amulets for protection. Gallop characterized the types as fol- lows: The objects which constitute these amulets fall into several classes. Among natural substances thus used are many drawn from the animal kingdom such as toads' legs, snakes' or bats' heads, horns, and bones; from the vegetable world, such as rosemary, wild lav- ender, broom, garlic, four-leaved clover, nuts with three kernels, and olive stones; and from the mineral, such as iron, steel, jet, coral, stone and rock-crystal. The shapes into which these and other substances are worked may also of themselves carry virtue. There is, for example, the horseshoe, the half-moon, the fish, the heart, the pentacle or Solomon's seal, and the "fig". Yet another class of amulet is formed by objects to which extraneous circumstances have lent a virtue which would not otherwise reside in them. In this class may be numbered "thunderbolts", herbs that have been blessed, pieces of red thread the exact length of a particular Saint's height, rings from dead men's fingers, fragments of winding sheets and, at Vinhais, that sinister object the mao de finado or "hand or glory", the dried and pickled right hand of a dead man, which is in great demand with thieves since it is reputed to have the gift of opening locked doors and inflicting on householders by sympathetic magic the deafness and insensibility of its defunct owner.30 A number of other Portuguese beliefs and practices could be mentioned that are similar to those of West Africans, but the foregoing are sufficient to prepare medieval Portuguese mariners (and the readers of this paper) for a voyage along the coast of West Africa. The foregoing examples attest that there were more "pagan" survivals in Portuguese religious beliefs and practices than Dias de Carvalho and Portuguese of the upper classes knew about--or wished to acknowledge. One can only speculate concern-</page><page sequence="12">12 GEORGE E. BROOKS ing the beliefs of the mostly illiterate or poorly-educated Por- tuguese mariners, traders, soldiers, and priests who ventured out to West Africa from the mid-fifteenth century, some of whom set- tled in the Guinea-Bissau region and neighboring Senegambia. McCall's provocative statement concerning "Old World Neolith- ic Religions as a single continuum" quoted at the beginning of this section also serves as prologue to the Basil Davidson quo- tation introducting the section following--that medieval Portu- guese encountered few African beliefs "more disconcerting than others they could find at home." Seemingly, Davidson might have stated that Portuguese found few African beliefs significantly different than those found at home. So too might West Africans have said concerning Portuguese beliefs.31 III Religious Beliefs and Practices of the Guinea-Bissau Region [Portuguese] ran into many amazing beliefs and superstitions,but few or none that seemed more dis- concerting than others they could find at home. Vic- torious Congolese armies tended to see signs and ghostly symbols in the sky, yet there was nothing out of the way in that. The Portuguese themselves regular- ly saw angels, and so of course did other Europeans.32 Papel, Diola, Biafada, Balanta, and other groups dwelling in the coastal-riverine areas of the Guinea-Bissau region are characterized as acephalous or "domocratic" societies, contrast- ing with Mandinka and other stratified societies living in the woodlands and savannas of the interior. The latter possess hierarchical social structures comprising ruling elites, free people, "casted" groups such as blacksmiths, and in past times, domestic slaves. The social and cultural patterns of the acephalous groups in the Guinea-Bissau region were remarkably resistant to external influences, African and European both. Nothwithstanding that the coastal-riverine peoples had commercial relations with Mande- speaking groups, including Muslim traders,for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans in the mid-fifteenth century, and that many Portuguese settled among them, their social and cultural pat- terns continued largely unchanged down to the present century. Their religious beliefs and practices in particular were little influenced by either Islam or Christianity until the present cen- tury. Indeed, Muslim Mandinka and Portuguese and Luso-African Christians alike evinced great respect--oftentimes expressing fear and awe--for the spiritual practices of coastal-riverine groups, and frequently had recourse to their religious specialists for a variety of purposes: for establishing social relations, for ratifying commercial agreements, for mediation with local spirits, and for medical and spiritual healing.</page><page sequence="13">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 13 As elsewhere in Africa, the religious beliefs and practices of the peoples of western Africa defined and gave meaning to their lives; they were the warp-and-woof of a person's existence. John S. Mbiti explains: Because traditional religions permeate all the departments of life, there is no formal distinction between the sacred and the secular, between the reli- gious and non-religious, between the spiritual and the material areas of life. Wherever the African is, there is his religion: he carries it to the fields where he is sowing seeds or harvesting a new crop; he takes it with him to the beer party or to attend a funeral cere- mony;... Traditional religions are not primarily for the individual, but for his community of which he is a part. Chapters of African religions are written every- where in the life of the community, and in tradition- al society there are no irreligious people. To be human is to belong to the whole community, and to do so involves participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals of that community. A person can- not detach himself from the religion of his group, for to do so is to be severed from his roots, his founda- tion, his context of security, his kinships and the entire group of those who make him aware of his own existence. 33 The religious beliefs and practices of coastal-riverine societies in the Guinea-Bissau region were similar to those of other socieites in western Africa. Beliefs concerning the spirit world and its manifestations incorporate four categories of super- natural phenomena that interact with each other and with human- kind.34 The first is a creator god remote from everyday affairs, is difficult to communicate with, and consequently is considered dissociated from humans' ordinary affairs. The name of the high god differs from society to society, e.g., Diola: Emitay; Bi- jago: Nindo; Badyaranke: Kodan; and Susu: Our0t-an.35 A sig- nificant, if indirect, influence of the high god on human affairs may be that its known existence may have predisposed the peoples of western Africa to accept the arguments of Muslim clerics and Christian missionaries concerning the existence of Allah and God. A second category of supernatural phenomena comprises spir- its dwelling in the soil, waters, flora, and fauna. These spir- its are generally considered "amoral," with arbitrary powers to protect or injure humans. Their assistance or non-interference in human affairs may be invoked by prayers and offerings, and by the mediating influences of ancestor spirits. Trees are a favored abode of spirits, and the most powerful spirits reside in the tallest trees of an area. It is incumbent on a group founding a new community to establish links with the spirits liv- ing there, which ties are afterwards maintained by religious cere-</page><page sequence="14">14 GEORGE E. BROOKS monies and offerings. In the Guinea-Bissau region, gods and spirits are known as irans (ira'o, tchina, china, hatsychyna, etc.). Africans create statues and other objects as temporary dwelling places for spir- its, which serve as the focus of religious ceremonies and place of offerings. These are likewise referred to as irans, and are mentioned in European sources as "idols" and "fetishes."36 As was the case for saints' images in Portugal, objects are some- times verbally abused or knocked about when spirits appear indif- ferent to petitions for assistance.37 A third category of supernatural phenomena comprises ances- tors or the "living dead." At death humans become inhabitants of the spirit world where they may intercede with other spirits on behalf of their descendants and the community at large. Con- versely, if displeased with the actions or neglect of their liv- ing kin, ancestor spirits may deny them assistance, or inflict harm on them. Many West African societies believe in reincarnation and regard life and death as a continuum: there must be deaths in order that there may be births; thus the living constitute a "minority" of the members of a society. Coastal-riverine socie- ties of the Guinea-Bissau region are extremely solicitious con- cerning ancestors. Deceased were interred close to dwellings, in some societies underneath the floors of dwellings, excepting individuals guilty of witchcraft, murder, or other anti-social behavior, in which case their bodies are disposed of in the bush away from a village. Gravesites are marked by posts, strips of cloth, or by other means. Food offerings are periodically placed by graves, where descendants hold family rites and religious ceremonies communicating with spirits at the time of planting and other important periods in the life cycle.38 Medieval Por- tuguese and other Europeans who held the dead in awe and fear, who communed with ancestors concerning crops and while dining in graveyards on All Souls' Day and May Day, and who dreaded ghosts and other spiritual manifestations, would have found African be- liefs and practices concerning the dead compatible with their own. A fourth category of supernatural phenomena comprises forces and powers immanent in vegetable, animal, and mineral substances. Individuals adept in such matters may encapsulate such forces in the horns of wild or domestic animals, in leather pouches, and in other containers which operate as "power generators" increasing the strength of the substances many-fold. Such amulets or talis- mans (grisgris or gree-grees in popular usage) are sought to pro- tect individuals and their possessions from sickness and harm; alternatively, they may possess "offensive" powers to attract and win the affections of another person, or to weaken or kill an ad- versary or an enemy. In former times, initiation societies com- bined control of such powers with human organizational abilities directed to specific social purposes: Simo, Poro, and other so- cieties appointed rulers, mediated conflicts between groups, arbitrated judicial processes, and expedited commerce between different societies by means of highly-organized and stratified leadership networks believed to control supernatural powers.z</page><page sequence="15">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 15 Medieval European medical practioners, not to mention "witches" and other specialists in the occult, likewise compound- ed remedies and distilled potions alleged to possess megical and regenerative powers. European churches and chapels were filled with relics to rival those of any African shrine. Little wonder that Portuguese and their Luso-African descendants wore African talismans, consulted African healers, and participated in Afri- can communal religious ceremonies.

African hosts treated them in much the same manner as they did African traders, applying to them "landlord-stranger" reciproci- ties. African 'landlords' and members of African communities guaranteed the safety and security of strangers' persons and prop- erty, assisted them in collecting payments and resolving disputes, and otherwise promoted their interests. Venturesome Portuguese and Cape Verdeans who settled among African societies to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by landlord-stranger reciprocities came to be termed langados, from the Portuguese se-Zancar, which may be translated as "cast- ing one's lot" among Africans. One of the most important priv- ileges accorded resident strangers, African or European, was that of marrying local women, usually women related to rulers or other influential persons in a community so that they might derive addi- tional advantages from kinship affiliation with strangers. Wives were invaluable to lancados, as interpreters of languages and cultures, and as colla orators in commercial exchanges. African women took advantages of these circumstances for their own bene- fit no less than that of male relatives, with the consequence that they came to exercise a crucial role as commerical intermed- iaries and culture-brokers between African societies and visiting European traders, which intermediary role was similarly exploited by their Eur-African children, female and male both. Of particular significance in the context of this paper, from the end of the fifteenth century, some langados came to be termed tangomaos, which in Portuguese and Luso-African usage connoted "renegades" or "outcasts," individuals who had forsaken European ways. Tangomaos manifestly found it in their interests to integrate their lives with Africans even more closely than did lancados, for they wore African dress and protective amulets, underwent circumcision and scarification, participated in African</page><page sequence="16">16 GEORGE E. BROOKS rituals, and otherwise adapted to African customs. The term tangomao seemingly derives from tangomaas, the Temni/Sapi name for the priestly lineage which controlled the shrines of an in- itiation society--probably the Simo society, which controlled the highly remunerative trade in kola harvested in the coastal forest belt of Guinea-Conakry and transported northwards by the Biafada-Sapi and Banyun-Bak commercial networks. Seemingly Portuguese and Luso-Africans were co-opted into Biafada-Sapi trading groups for reasons of mutual advantage, a principal reason being their possession of caravels that could transport larger quantities of kola and other cargo than African dugout craft and make long voyages as far north as the Gambia River and Sine-Saloum estuary.41 Some Portuguese sources use tangomao and langado interchange- ably, and it would have been surprising if matters were other- wise. For langados and Luso-Africans, like tangomaos, lived immersed in African communities for security of their persons and property, and during (frequent) periods of illness their lives depended on the nursing of their African and Luso-African wives and treatment by African medical practitioners. They were, in brief, physically and psychologically dependent on Af- ricans. Eur-Africans, or in the context of the Guinea-Bissau region, Luso-Africans, represented a new and unprecedented element in West Africa. In social and cultural terms, Luso-Africans were more "African" than "Portuguese," and the short prefix "Luso" serves to communicate the proportionately much smaller "Europe- an" heritage vs. "African" heritage of an individual raised by an African or Luso-African mother in an African milieu. Growing up in African cultures and possessing some knowledge of European ways, more or less depending on circumstances, Luso- Africans possessed unique potential to function as commercial and cultural intermediaries. Nonetheless, their opportunities and range of possibilities must have been largely determined by the status and privileges accorded by their mothers' societies: to what extent they inherited their mothers' social ranking, rights to land use, and other prerogatives. Differences be- tween stratified and acephalous societies must have been signif- icant determinants, but these parameters remain to be adequate- ly studied. Some Luso-African males and females became traders, like their mothers and fathers. Many likely "disappeared" into Af- rican communities, becoming fully enculturated. Likely, too, a number of male Luso-Africans settled in grumete communities. Grumetes were auxiliary seamen hired to navigate trading craft, to perform ancillary skilled occupations such as boat-building and repair, and to serve as compradors at trading establishments. Many Papel and Biafada took employment as grumetes, and there developed grumete communities at all the principal trading set- tlements of the Upper Guinea Coast and Senegambia. Like grumetes, domestic slaves shared with Portuguese and Luso-Africans the day-to-day activities of the small trading com- munities, learned Crioulo, and adopted Luso-African customs and</page><page sequence="17">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 17 practices. Probably domestic slaves acculturated to Luso-Afri- can mores even more than grumetes did, inasmuch as they had been wrenched from distant societies and were constrained to adopt the ways of their masters and the communities in which they lived. Domestic slaves were used in a variety of trade- related and household tasks. Men were often procured because they were skilled smiths, woodworkers, or weavers, or were trained in these and other skills. It would appear that many slaves, or their children (the latter not infrequently fathered by their masters), were granted their freedom and were absorbed into the Luso-African and grumete communities. Unfortunately, there is little documentary evidence concerning such matters, and research is made the more difficult from the circumstance that both grumetes and slaves were given, or adopted, Portu- guese first names and often acquired -their masters' surnames as well. The Cape Verde archipelago early became linked to West Af- rica in an economic and social nexus. Traders based in the archipelago carried on an increasing proportion of Portuguese commerce with Senegambia and the Upper Guinea Coast. Two of the largest islands, Sao Tiago and Fogo, were found to have sufficient rainfall to support plantation agriculture, with the consequence that captives were brought from West Africa to cul- tivate sugar, cotton, and indigo and herd livestock on these and other islands where mountainous terrain or sparse rainfall precluded the cultivation of export crops. Cape Verde-born Portuguese and, increasingly, Cape Verde- born Luso-Africans soon became more numerous than peninsula Por- tuguese as langados living in Senegambia and along the Upper Guinea Coast. Individuals born in the archipelago acquired im- munities and resistance to dysenteries, malaria, and other dis- eases endemic in West Africa. Not less advantageously, they learned CriouZo, or "Black Portuguese," the language of the Islands and which with Mandinka served as a commercial lingua franca for Senegambia and the Upper Guinea Coast from the six- teenth century onwards. Cape Verdeans likewise acquired inval- uable knowledge of West Africa languages, social institutions, and cultural practices from parents and relatives, and from cap- tives brought to the archipelago in an almost uninterrupted flow for use in the Islands and for resale and shipment to the Ameri- cas. Denounced as interlopers in trading monopolies granted by the kings of Portugal, branded "outlaws" and worse, lancados and tangomaos wrote little concerning their affairs, but suffi- cient information was recorded to delineate some of their rela- tionships with their African hosts and trading associates. For example, Andre Alvares d'Almada, a Cape Verdean-born Luso-Afri- can who visited the Cacheu River in 1570, related that Portu- guese and Luso-Africans trading there insisted that commercial agreements be annually ratified by religious ceremonies that in- cluded the sacrifice of dogs and chickens and bound both parties to fulfillment of obligations on risk of punishment by irans, or spirits.43 It is noteworthy that such rites were described</page><page sequence="18">18 GEORGE E. BROOKS as early as Fernandes' compendium of 1506-1510, not revealing however, that Portuguese traders were involved--nor, as Almada relates, insisted on participating in them.4 The Guinea-Bissau region was the nexus of the Biafada-Sapi, Banyun-Bak, and Mandinka commercial networks which expedited trade between three ecological zones and the coastal-riverine areas of western Africa. From reasons of self-interest, trading groups associated with the Biafada-Sapi and Banyun-Bak commercial networks for several centuries permitted Portuguese and Luso- Africans to participate in their coastwise and overland commerce, with ramifications which remain to be studied. To cite one not- able complex of interactions, as a consequence of the Mani in- vasion of Sierra Leone in the mid-sixteenth century, Portuguese vessels transported several shiploads of Temni and Bullom refu- gees to Cacheu in the Guinea-Bissau region. Many of the refugees and their descendants were converted to Christianity. Some of their children were taken to the Cape Verde Islands for educa- tion, afterwards to return to Cacheu and to Sierra Leone.45 Some of the most informative reports concerning the activi- ties of Portuguese and Luso-African traders along the Upper Guinea Coast and Senegambia were written by Fr. Balthasar Bar- reira, a Jesuit priest who travelled down the coast from Senegal to Sierra Leone in 1605 and lived in Sierra Leone until 1609. Respecting traders' religious practices, Barreira related that Portuguese roam these parts like sheep without a shep- herd, men turned wild whose way of life is more heathen than Christian, men who go many years without sacraments or mass, without hearing the word of God, even without remembering it. And elsewhere in the same report: I wish to state here what often occurred to me, that although I had come to these parts with the sole aim of hearing the confessions of the Christians to be found here, my coming and the labours of the journey were put to especially good use, since the confessions covered ten or twenty years, or in quite of number of instances, over thirty years or even a whole life-time spent "in medio nationis pravae" ("in the midst of a people of unclean lips," Isaiah 6:5), where no dif- ference can be perceived between the practices of the Christians and those of the heathen.46 A spate of missionary endeavors date from Barreira's recon- naissance, but Jesuit involvement in the Guinea-Bissau region was short-lived. They were followed by Portuguese and Spanish Franciscans, but for lack of financial resources missionary enter- prise lapsed. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the trading communities were principally served by clergy from the Cape Verde Islands. Cacheu, Bissau, and Ziguinchor seem gen- erally to have had resident priests, but Farim and Geba were with-</page><page sequence="19">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 19 out priests for years at a time, while Luso-African communities in the Gambia, Grande, Nunez, and other rivers received only sporadic visits from priests dispatched on trading vessels from the Cape Verde Islands.47 The desultory nature of clerical activities in West Africa contributed to the ongoing syncretism in trading communities and neighboring African societies. There developed in West Africa, most notably in the Guinea-Bissau region and Senegambia, what may be termed a "Luso-African lifestyle" that comprised African and Portuguese elements. These included the use of Crioulo as a Zingua franca, and for many a "first" language; inter-marriage with Africans and Luso-Africans, but use of Portuguese family and first names along with claims to be "Portuguese" and "white;" use of Portuguese-style clothing, dwellings, and house furnish- ings; use and dissemination of imported European, American, and Asian plants, trees, and domestic animals (e.g., pigs and citrus trees from Portugal, pineapples and peanuts from South America, and mangos and padi rice from South Asia); a diet and cuisine comprising both African and imported foods, condiments, and cook- ing styles; and in the religious sphere, participation in, and reliance on, African rites and medical practices. With respect to the last, it mattered little whether priests were available or not: all evidence indicates that few Portuguese, Cape Verde- ans, or Guinea-born Luso-Africans attended mass, sanctified their marriages, or received other sacraments. The most notable "Christian" practice was wearing crucifixes, which together with European-style clothing served to identify its wearer to Afri- cans and visiting Europeans as a trader and a "Portuguese."48 Of particular relevance to the topic of this paper is the custom of chfros (Port: weeping), wakes held to commemorate the deaths of notable persons. Ch&amp;ros include feasting and dancing to musical accompaniments, which elements of open-air feasting and joyous music are similar to Portuguese observances of All Souls' Day and May Day recounted above. That early Christian converts (cristaos) continued to participate in choros is re- vealed in a report concerning a Franciscan missionary who attempt- ed to halt a ch8ro held in Banyun territory neighboring Cacheu in 1664. The priest barely escaped with his life through the intervention of several cristaos. Christian converts like- wise continued to commune with their ancestors, including through the intermediation of balobeiros (or valobeiros) who were con- sulted concerning important matters such as commercial undertak- ings.50 The foregoing developments are principally associated with the Guinea-Bissau region, which sustained close links with the Cape Verde archipelago. From the 1580s Dutch, French, and English competition in Senegambia and along the Upper Guinea Coast gradually restricted Portuguese and Cape Verdeans to a trading sphere extending from the Casamance to the Grande rivers, with Luso-Africans living in this region carrying on relay trade northwards to the Gambia River and southwards along the coast. The constriction of Cape Verdean trade to focus on the Guinea-Bissau region concomitantly increased and reinforced cul-</page><page sequence="20">20 GEORGE E. BROOKS tural exchanges, with reciprocal and cumulative effects on the populations of both areas. Wasteful agricultural practices and overgrazing exacerbated the recurrent droughts and famines which ravaged the Cape Verde archipelago, necessitating repopulation of the Islands with captive Africans, who from the eighteenth century onwards were drawn almost exclusively from the Guinea- Bissau region and neighboring areas. African population incre- ments continuously modified the demographic and cultural char- acteristics of the people of the Cape Verde Islands. At the same time, numerous Cape Verdeans were impelled to seek their livelihood in Guinea, as traders, administrators, soldiers, sailors, artisans, and priests; and many of those who returned to the Islands brought families and dependents. As a consequence, as time passed the populations of both the Cape Verde Islands and the coastal and riverine areas of the Guinea-Bissau region became demographically and culturally more "Luso-African." To the archipelago's early inhabitants, a small minority of white landholders and traders controlling numerous enslaved Africans, was added an augmenting population of Luso-Africans, slave and free, possessing a dual heritage. And notwithstanding that the Luso-Africans' and Africans' de- pendent relationships constrained them to emulate the behavior patterns of the dominant white--and as time passed, not so white-- ruling oligarchy, the unending influx of captives from the Guinea-Bissau region ensured continuing cultural mixing as well as miscegenation among the three groups. Cape Verdeans who lived in the Guinea-Bissau region, whether for a short time or for many years, reinforced the trading com- munities and disseminated Luso-African and Portuguese attributes among the neighboring African societies, absorbing much from them in return. However, these social and cultural exchanges significantly affected only the coastal and riverine societies of the Guinea-Bissau region with whom Luso-Africans and Portu- guese had sustained relations, and had little influence on the Mandinka and Fula peoples living in the woodlands and savannas of the interior.51 Economic, social, and cultural patterns in the Guinea-Bissau region were modified significantly during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a consequence of changing landlord- stranger relationships. African societies gradually denied Luso-Africans (and other Eur-Africans and Europeans) access to interior trade routes, forcing them to limit their commercial activities to coastal and riverine settlements. Why Diola, Papel, and other groups changed their practices is not known, but in effect they adopted the exclusive policies long enforced by Mandinka in the areas they controlled. "Encapsulated" in a few settlements, Luso-Africans associated more closely with Cape Verdeans and Portuguese, increasingly married endogamously, and otherwise (re-)asserted the "Portuguese" and "Christian" elements of their heritage--a process that received new impetus from the last quarter of the nineteenth century with Portuguese conquest and colonial rule and renewed missionary efforts by priests from Portugal and from the seminary founded on Sao</page><page sequence="21">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 21 Nicolau in 1866.52 The process of "encapsulation" was already well advanced by the 1830s when Lopes de Lima described grumete religious practices at Cacheu. Banyun and Diola had closed the combina- tion of water and land routes between the Cacheu and Casamance rivers around the beginning of the nineteenth century. The pat- tern of trade along the Cacheu River was for Luso-Africans and Portuguese (the latter in declining numbers) to live at Cacheu near the mouth of the river, visit Farim at the head of naviga- tion during the dry season, and leave commerce elsewhere along the river and its tributaries to grumete compradors. Overland commerce between Cacheu and Bissau ended around 1805, when the Naga group of Papel living between the Cacheu and Mansoa rivers closed their territory to Luso-African and Portuguese traders, which interdiction apparently lasted until the time of colonial conquest. The closing of Naga territory together with the blackade previously imposed by Banyun and Diola between the Cacheu and Casamance rivers forced Luso-Africans and Portuguese to travel by water between the three commercial centers of Bissau, Cacheu, and Ziguinchor. The time-consuming, lengthy, and at times dan- gerous sea passages contributed to infrequent communications, and had the consequence of isolating each community from the others. These circumstances were exploited from the 1820s by French, Franco-African, and Senegalese traders and by French colonial officials in Senegal, who dismembered Ziguinchor and the Casamance River from "Portuguese Guinea," thereby completing the process initiated by Banyun and Diola. The middle of the nineteenth century marked the nadir of Por- tuguese and Cape Verdean involvement in the Guinea-Bissau re- gion. Slave trading continued until mid-century, with commerce in peanuts, rice, and other 'legitimate' commodities becoming significant only during the 1840s. Neglected and virtually abandoned by the penurious Portuguese government, military per- sonnel and government officials went unpaid for years at a time, and the barracks and government buildings decayed and crumbled. The pragas were garrisoned by a rabble in rags, men who were convicts (degredados) and the culls of the Cape Verde garrison, plus a few men recruited in Guinea. What Portuguese "presence" existed in the trading communities was due to the Luso-African, Cape Verdean, and Portuguese traders and the influence they exercised by means of commercial and family ties with African elites, and the strength of their personal retinues of family members, grumetes, and clients.53 The Portuguese conquest of Guinea dates to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as Portugal belatedly undertook to compete with rival imperial powers and salvage what it could of its African territorial claims. For Guinea, as elsewhere, the conquest was not easy, and not until the 1920s was all of the territory "pacified" and brought under Portuguese administration. Portuguese imperialism was accompanied by renewed missionary en- deavor, accounting for the presence at Bolama in 1898 of both General Dias de Carvalho and C6nego Serpa Pinto.</page><page sequence="22">22 GEORGE E. BROOKS V Celebration of the New Year and Harvest Time in the Guinea- Bissau Region All the people of this coast live in profound ignor- ance. Even the spectacle of the heavens teaches them nothing, other than to keep time by the changes of the moon. They possess no traditional means of re- cording their thoughts, nor to record their epochs. They do not name the months, and even the first day of each year, which they celebrate, is adjustable according to the desires of the elders with respect to the appearance of the new moon in November. Their week has six days, five of which they labor, and the sixth (called Fiei) is spent in drinking, sleeping, wrestling, or dancing to the accompaniment of hand- clapping. 5s As in "pagan" Europe, many West African religious ceremon- ies and festivals were linked to the change of seasons, notably the times of year associated with planting and harvesting. Of special interest to this paper, rice is the staple crop for the coastal-riverine societies of the Guinea-Bissau region, and in former times the end of the rice harvest coincided with the celebration of the new year around the first of November. First mention of West Africans' observance of the new year is found in Valentim Fernandes' compendium dating to 1506-1510 in a section discussing "Serra Lyoa," which in Portuguese usage comprised the coastline of modern-day Guinea-Conakry and Sierra Leone. Fernandes records that Africans count years from Novem- ber to November, because that is the time of their harvests. Months are determined by the appearance of the new moon.ss Sim- ilar information concerning the Guinea-Bissau region is recorded in an offhand manner three centuries later by Jose Joaquim Lopes de Lima, commandant of the praca of Cacheu in 1830/31. In a statement disparaging Africans for lacking a (European) sense of time, Lopes de Lima remarks that even the observance of the new year is changeable, for it is set according to the determin- ation of community leaders around the beginning of November.56 What would seem almost certainly a description of a new year's observance is recorded in Pierre Davity's compendium. Discussing the people of Cassa, a Mandinka-ruled state extending between the middle and upper reaches of the Cacheu and Casamance rivers with a population comprising Diola, Balanta, and other coastal-riverine groups, Davity reported: Les habitants de Cassanga sont idolatres. Leur prin- cipal idole est appellee China ' laquelle ils font une procession le 29 Novembre sur la minuit. Un de leurs Prestres ou Magiciens, qu'ils appellent Aracani portant une baniere de soye azuree, ou est peint un</page><page sequence="23">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 23 faisseau de serment avec plusieurs ossements de morts: je crois que c'est de ceux qui le sacrifient volontaire- ment a ce Demon, qui leur apparoist en diverses manieres, &amp; ce port baniere a un habit tissu de palmes, ou sont attachoes plusieurs testes de petits chiens, guenons &amp; autres bestioles. Quand leur procession est achevee ils posent l'Idole dans le creux d'un arbre &amp; luy font des fufumigations fort odorantes, sacrifiant du miel &amp; font leurs prieres &amp; se retirent en leurs habitations.57 As related in the previous section, china/irao/iran means "spirit" or "god." Aracani may derive from the Susu word for "high god": Our'-Kan. One may suppose that the tree was a large one, likely the chief abode of the community's protective spirits. Evidently Davity derived his information from several sources; indeed, his account may incorporate details from dif- ferent ceremonies. However, taking the account at face value, several elements suggest that it describes a new year's obser- vance. It is a nighttime ceremony; such is requisite for obtain- ing a glimpse of the new moon. It is described as a solemn oc- casion, with none of the merrymaking or dissipation associated with harvest festivals. Two factors may explain the discrepancy between Davity's specific date, November 29, and the reports of Fernandes and Lopes de Lima that the new year was observed around the first of November. Besides the discordance between solar- and lunar- based calendars, there is the added variable of a half-dozen days. According to Lopes de Lima, the reason community leaders convened following the appearance of the new moon to set the day of observance of a new year was to coordinate its celebra- tion with the six-day weekly cycle of five days of labor and a leisure day.58 Secondly, European Portestants and Catholics reckoned according to different calendars following Pope Gregory XIII's initiative in 1582 when ten days were dropped from the Julian calendar. Protestants long continued to use the Julian calendar. What is noteworthy in the context of this paper is that Af- ricans living in the Guinea-Bissau region observed a nighttime religious ceremony honoring their deities and their dead at the same time of year as Europeans--whose rites derive from pagan times. The African observance honors both deities and ancestors (the latter being intermediaries with the spirit world), thereby combining in one ceremony the two European festivals of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. This extraordinary coincidence of time and congruence of functions defies probability and sug- gests that the rites derive from a shared heritage. Comparing Davity's account with that of Dias de Carvalho's description of the events associated with All Souls' Day festiv- ities at Bolama in 1898, one notes that Davity's account is strikingly similar to Dias de Carvalho's report for the first evening of the observance. Dias de Carvalho related that the first night's activities during the early morning hours of All</page><page sequence="24">24 GEORGE E. BROOKS Saints' Day commence at the door of the church, whence the in- digenous Christians walk in procession through the streets of the community singing the Ave Maria mixed with African songs. What is also remarkable is a description of the observance of the eve of All Souls' Day on Sa7'o Tiago Island dating to ca. 1830. Recorded by Jose Joaquim Lopes de Lima, it has fascinat- ing ramifications with respect to the Portugal-Cape Verde archi- pelago-Guinea nexus: Another old religious rite [of Portuguese origins] es- tablished there, is for families to leave their homes at midnight on the night of November 1 (eve of All Souls' Day) to pray in chorus at the closed doors of churches for the souls of their deceased.59 Lopes de Lima reported nothing about the preceding day or the day following. And herecords nothing concerning such an obser- vance at Cacheu while he was commandant in 1830/31; whether he was present in Cacheu on November 1-2 is not known. Although he generalized that the carnival-like celebration goes on for three nights, Dias de Carvalho specified that the "debauchery" is worst the night of the second day--All Souls' Day. After a few hours of rest following the dawn of the third day (November 3), the final proceedings take place, consisting of feasting and drinking indoors or in the open air at a place some distance from the settlement, ending with the singing of Ave Marias for the souls of the departed. One would like to know the place where people congregated the third day: was it the graveyard? Information is lacking as to when and in what circumstances Luso-Africans, grumetes, and other Africans came to observe All Souls' Day. Three factors would seem relevant: The first is that Luso-Africans and grumetes and their families, plus other Africans living at Cacheu, Bissau, and other trading communities, were inevitably linked to European time-reckoning from their in- volvement in the Atlantic trading world. Additionally, the presence of priests in these communities would have encouraged the observance of a seven-day week and informed the inhabitants about the annual cycle of church festivals and days of obliga- tion. Secondly, the significance attached to the celebration of All Saints' and All Souls' days in Portugal must have ensured some observance in Africa, even by men largely incorporated into African communities and otherwise neglectful of Christian holy days. Crews of trading vessels would have reminded them, and latent motivation could have been stimulated and encouraged by the leadership of priests in the trading communities. A third factor may be that the celebration of All Souls' Day coincided with the opening of the trading season in the Mandinka communities of Farim and Geba at the head of navigation of the Cacheu and Geba rivers. Caravans from the interior visited Farim and Geba only during the dry season from November to March. The pattern was for Portuguese and Luso-African traders to live at</page><page sequence="25">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 25 Cacheu and Bissau during the rainy season, and sail upriver in November-December with their entourages of grumetes and domestic slaves. Celebration of All Souls' Day must have taken on aspects of a farewell to loved ones and a "new year's" celebration with the community looking forward with anticipation to a successful trading season. One might expect, too, that the leading members of the trading community and the commandants of the pracas would contribute generously to the festivities. Dias de Carvalho did not mention how the poorer elements of this community could drink and feast for three days, but African communities received "customary" presents from "their" 'strangers' at festival times.60 Grumetes (and their families) evidently were prominent among the "indigenous Christians" Dias de Carvalho observed at Bolama, for hE prefaced his description of the All Souls' Day observance with sianderous remarks concerning them--remarks, interestingly, quoted from Lopes de Lima: These Negroes only pretend to be Christians by attend- ing Mass, whenever it is celebrated, and mix the sacred words of our Religion with falsities of their paganism. At other times they live unbridled lives given over to drunkenness and debauchery.61 Lopes de Lima, be it noted, shared with Dias de Carvalho a pro- prietary view with respect to "our" religion. Both men, however, would have been embarrassed to acknowledge that such assertions concerning grumetes could as appropriately apply to some of the Portuguese and Luso-African members of the community, especially the soldiers. Such was likewise true for French and British set- tlements in West Africa.62 Turning now to the celebration of harvest time, Fernandes and Lopes de Lima related that West Africans count years from harvest to harvest, from November to November. Such is no long- er the case in the Guinea-Bissau region, for rice is harvested from September to February. There have been significant changes in agriculture since Fernandes' time, and especially during the past century and a half. The species of rice indigenous to West Africa is Oryza glaberrima. It was first domesticated and grown in West Africa as an "upland" or "dry" rice, which is harvested in the Guinea-Bissau region from mid-September onwards. Culti- vation of "wet" or "paddy" varieties of 0. gZaberrima was a late development, perhaps beginning not long prior to the arrival of Europeans in the mid-fifteenth century. "Wet" rice is harvested later than "upland" rice, from November to February after the padis and swamplands dry following the end of the rainy season in October.63 Inasmuch as "wet" rice, whether a variety of 0. glaberrima or of 0. sativa, is harvested later than "upland" rice, from No- vember to February, one consequence was that the celebration of harvest time and the new year around the first of November be- came an anomaly in the midst of a lengthened harvest season now extending from September to February. This circumstance was com-</page><page sequence="26">26 GEORGE E. BROOKS pounded from the 1830s by the cultivation of peanuts as a cash crop, first in Senegambia, then in the Guinea-Bissau region. Men harvest peanuts in December and January (while women gather in rice), either harvesting their own fields in the Guinea-Bissau region, or those of African cultivators in Senegambia for whom they work as labor migrants.64 Harvest festivals continued, but were delayed until Janu- ary or February when the rice and peanut crops were in, and la- bor migrants returned home. Among some cultivators the changed circumstances contributed to longer periods of celebration and greater dissipation than previously was the case, with men, wo- men, and children indulging in drunken splurges fueled by Euro- pean spirits purchased with cash crop earnings. Meantime, the new year's observance seemingly came to be neglected by many groups, its significance diminished by the change in the harest period, and its religious meaning undermined by the spread of Islam and Christianity. If the time of harvesting crops in the Guinea-Bissau re- gion changed, the nature of the celebrations remained much the same. In West Africa and elsewhere in the world, harvest festi- vals serve to release the emotional and social tensions that accumulate during the preceding months. For cultivators, the unremitting toil of harvesting constitutes an intensification not only of onerous physical demands, but of emotional strain as well. Psychological tensions are engendered by the uncer- tainties associated with rainfall, crop diseases, and as harvest time approaches, by the depredations of animals and birds. Appeals to supernatural assistance are universal among cul- tivators. Likewise widespread are personal strains and rancors occasioned by envy and resentment of others' success; some per- sons may have paranoid notions that other individuals may pro- fit at their expense. For example, Mark Schloss notes that the Ehing group of Diola living along the lower Casamance River be- lieve that some individuals may offer the souls of other per- sons to spirits of the land in exchange for a good rice crop. And Schloss perceptively observes that the tedious and demanding labor associated with harvesting rice stalk-by-stalk extending over many weeks makes Diola women very irritable.65 Such personal and community tensions find release in harvest festivals and the period of leisure following. In West Africa and Europe both, harvest festivals are characterized as times of revelry, heavy drinking, and relaxation of social mores. In past times, people living in the Guinea-Bissau region principally consumed palm wine, plus a type of mead fermented from honey at times of celebration. Palm wine is only mildly. alcoholic, people are habituated to it by frequent use, and its consumption has divine sanction inasmuch as it is considered a necessary medium tc maintain contact with spirits.66 Mead has a much stronger alcoholic content, and following the arrival of Portuguese and other Europeans, some groups came to consume wine, brandy, and aguardente (sugar cane brandy) in such quantities as to cause debauchery. One supposes that Portuguese and Luso-African tra- ders and the commandants of pra as and presidios were principal</page><page sequence="27">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 27 contributors of European spirits and much of the food consumed in All Souls' Day celebrations, whether willingly or constrained by "custom" which Africans astutely parlayed to their advantage. European accounts spanning the centuries particularly re- mark on heavy drinking, feasting, and dissipation among Diola groups following the harvest. Such celebrations may have been organized then as now by initiation societies. For example, Diola boys and girls living along the left bank of the Casamance River belong to a cultivation society that sacrifices to husag, the protector of youth. The society sponsors an annual harvest celebration with singing, dancing, drinking, and merry-making. Diola women living in Fogny (between the Casamance and Gambia rivers) who belong to the ebun society dedicated to a protective and curative spirit (boekin) customarily abandon their husbands following the harvest, and return to their parents' villages where they freely take such lovers as they please.67 Information concerning new year's observances are rare in recent anthropological literature. William S. Simmons describes a thanksgiving feast in a Badyaranke community that incorporates Muslim influences along with elements that resemble aspects of Davity's account. The Badyaranke live in southeastern Senegal, just across the Guinea-Bissau frontier. Kodan is the name of the high or sky god. Each year, after the harvests have been collec- ted and the young men have returned from their labors in the north of Senegal, a village communal feast of thanksgiving takes place called the offering (sada) of the hundred plates. This feast consists of a re- distribution of cooked food from all compounds, held at the village center. The entire population partici- pates, male and female, old and young. The men eat together on their sitting platform, and the women eat apart, seated on the ground. The chief and elders speak to Kodan, the genies, and the dead to thank them for the harvest, to ask them to protect the vil- lage from fire, and to ensure continued well-being.68 Such in spirit at least, may be characteristic of the observance of the new year in Novembers of times past, such as Davity de- scribes. VI Concluding Remarks The title of this paper ends with a question mark; so will these final comments. That West Africans and medieval Portuguese shared similar religious beliefs and practices would seem undeniable. Whether those derive from common neolithic origins is one of the congeries</page><page sequence="28">28 GEORGE E. BROOKS of unresolved issues concerning ancient social and cultural re- lationships between West Africa, the Sahara, the Nile valley, North Africa, and the Mediterranean basin, including western Europe. Outstanding issues include the origins and diffusion of agricultural practices, ironworking, art styles and motifs, legends, etc., which issues will preoccupy scholars for years, or decades, to come. For the purpose of this paper it is suf- ficient to show that whatever the reasons for similar religious beliefs and "parallel" customs and practices among West Africans and Portuguese, such facilitated social and economic relations and predisposed members of both groups to mutual accomodation and cultural syncretism. Information is lacking as to when and in what circumstances West African beliefs and practices concerning the observance of the new year and harvest-time festivals merged with those of Portuguese concerning All Saints' and All Souls' days, but man- ifestly these occurred in the Guinea-Bissau region. There is an obvious need for more historical inquiries concerning West African religious beliefs and practices, utilizing both oral traditions and the earliest European sources. The West Africa-Cape Verde archipelago-Portugal nexus re- presents a special field for historical and anthropological re- search. It was on the previously uninhabited Cape Verde archi- pelago that Portuguese and West Africans shared unique social and cultural interchanges that resulted in a racially mixed pop- ulation, the Crioulo language, and a wide range of syncretistic beliefs and customs which survived Portuguese efforts to root them out, especially during the two centuries prior to Cabo Verde's independence in 1975. These include African- and Portu- guese-derived religious beliefs and social customs mentioned in this paper and many others, including marriage customs, funeral practices, patterns of dress and adornment, folklore, and music styles. Lastly, one may wonder if the themes discussed in this paper are unique to West Africa and the Cape Verde Islands--what of the relationships involving Portuguese and Africans in Zaire, Angola, and Mozambique, and between other Europeans and Africans? Who will undertake the study of these challenging and fascinating topics? NOTES *This paper is dedicated to Gerald W.

The persistance of similar African funeral customs in the United States is remarked on by John W.

According to the traveler Henry</page><page sequence="33">ALL SOULS' DAY IN GUINEA-BISSAU 33 Knight, in the Southwest, 'When a slave dies, the master gives the rest day, of their [slaves] own choosing, to cele- brate the funeral. This, perhaps a month after the corpse is interred, is a jovial day with them; they sing and dance and drink the dead to his new home, which some believe to be in old Guinea.'" Note illustrations on pages 36 and 37; carved wooden grave markers in the cemetery on page 37 ex- hibit similarities to the "forquilas da alma" of the Guinea- Bissau region (see note 38).

For a stimulating comparative study of culture contact see George M. Foster, Culture and Con- quest: America's Spanish Heritage (Chicago, 1960). With respect to religious syncretism, Foster observes (15, 165- 66) that the Catholic Church emphasized Iberian practices it preferred; discouraged those it did not like, e.g., pagan survivals; and accepted syncretisms with indigenous beliefs where it had no choice.

Only rarely did commandants of the pragas of Cacheu and Bissau acknowledge such payments in official dispatches, encouraging the erroneous notion that their "fortresses" compelled awe and respect from Africans. In fact Portuguese pragas and presidios (detached garrisons) existed on the sufferance of Africans who desired commercial relations and who possessed a variety of effective sanctions as 'land- lords' to maintain their ascendancy over the trading com- munities and the impotent garrisons.
