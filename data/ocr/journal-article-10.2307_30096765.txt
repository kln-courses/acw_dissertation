<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRECLASSICAL GREECE-A SURVEY Four score years have passed since archaeological research began to occupy itself with the preclassical age of Greek lands; and this is perhaps an appro- priate moment to cast a brief appraising glance at what has been accomplished and what remains still to be done. It is an especially fitting subject in this volume of studies issued in honour of Professor Alan J. B. Wace, who has himself played so large a part in the task of uncovering and interpreting the early remains on the mainland of Greece. This long span of eight decades might be divided into two almost equal stages, that of pioneering exploration and discovery, and that of re-examination, more detailed research and synthesis. The first generation of preclassicists, dominated to a great extent by the colourful figure of Heinrich Schliemann, gave its attention to many of the large sites, well known from their role in Greek tradition. After his early successes at Troy Schliemann thus turned in 1876 to Mycenae, where he exposed the entrance through the Lion Gate, discovered the Grave Circle, and the Royal Shaft Graves with their rich treasure, and cleared in part the tholos tomb christened the Tomb of Clytemnestra. In 188o-81 he excavated what was left of the comparable tholos at Orchomenos, and in 1884, with the collaboration of Ddrpfeld, laid bare the palace at Tiryns. Chrestos Tsountas, who in 1886 followed in the footsteps of Schliemann at Mycenae, spent more than a decade in fruitful investigation: he uncovered the palace and many houses on the Mycenaean citadel, and excavated wholly or in part seven further tholoi as well as some two hundred chamber tombs. In 1889-90o he extended his researches farther afield and cleared tholos tombs at Vaphio in Laconia and at Kampos on the western side of Taygetos. Mean- while other tholos tombs had been found at Menidi (1879) and at Thorikos (1888) in Attica, and at Dimini (1886) in Thessaly; and chamber tombs in increasing numbers came to light at Spata (1877) and many other places in Attica, at Nauplia (1879), and elsewhere. Mycenaean remains were also recovered in the great excavation of the Acropolis at Athens, and at Eleusis. In 1878 and 1886 Furtwaingler and Loeschcke published Mykenische Thongefdsse and Mykenische Vasen, the first ambitious books on Mycenaean pottery; and by the end of the nineteenth century Mycenaean civilisation had come into our ken. Another culture, quite different and obviously more primitive, had also been revealed in the Cyclades, where many hundreds of cist graves were</page><page sequence="2">PRECLASSICAL GREECE--A SURVEY 17 discovered and excavated by Tsountas; his publications in AE 1898 and 1899 are still excellent models of reporting and analysis. The progress and develop- ment of Cycladic civilisation was further clarified in the admirable excavations of the British School at Phylakopi in Melos. With the opening of the twentieth century active interest turned to the north and south. In Thessaly excavations at Dimini, begun by others and completed by Tsountas, and the latter's own work at Sesklo disclosed a culture which flourished before the use of metal was introduced and which could therefore be attributed to a neolithic stage. Comparable pottery was also discovered by a Bavarian expedition at Orchomenos, where remains of pre- Mycenaean strata of the Bronze Age were likewise found. Other sites in Boeotia and Phocis soon yielded similar material. By I9Io all the major preclassical layers had been seen in one place or another, but their exact sequence and relation had not yet been determined. Meanwhile in Crete the great excavations of Sir Arthur Evans which began at Knossos in 1900 had brought to light a huge Minoan palace and deep accumulations of debris that presented an uninterrupted succession of strata. Observation of the stratigraphy enabled Evans in I9O6 to divide the Bronze Age into three main periods, which he called Early, Middle, and Late Minoan, and to recognise three definite subdivisions of each. This was an epoch- making achievement that established the framework of history in the Aegean Bronze Age. The system, which fitted well the other sites excavated in Crete, was quickly found to have a general application to the stratigraphy that had been recognised at Phylakopi, and was thus adopted also for the Cycladic area. To the second stage of preclassical research, which was interrupted by two local and two world wars, belongs the resumption of excavations by the German Archaeological Institute at Tiryns, which especially under the direction of G. Karo and K. MUiller yielded abundant new information about the architectural and ceramic history of the site. Eminent place must also be given to the work of the British School, conducted by A. J. B. Wace, which vastly enlarged our knowledge of the great monuments at Mycenae and their chronology, the Palace, the Grave Circle, the Lion Gate, the fortification walls, the tholos tombs, and also provided a detailed account of twenty-four further chamber tombs. A notable contribution was likewise made by G. Karo's detailed and scholarly publication (1930-33) of all the objects that Schliemann and Stamatakis had found in the Shaft Graves. The excavations of Wace and Thompson at several sites in Thessaly added much new material and brought clarification to many problems of the Neolithic Age, which was now seen to have had a long duration. Remains of C</page><page sequence="3">18 CARL W. BLEGEN a closely related, if not identical Neolithic culture, were gradually uncovered through the efforts of other archaeologists in Phocis, Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesos, and it became clear that the whole of continental Greece had been intensively occupied in that era. The discovery and excavation of several small, modest settlements, where no monumental construction had seriously disturbed the underlying accumu- lation, led to a considerable advance in our understanding of Greek pre- history; for here the stratification proved often to be relatively well preserved, and it demonstrated that the deposits of the Bronze Age consisted normally of three successive layers, each marked by distinctive architecture, tombs, and pottery. It thus became apparent that the Bronze Age on the mainland, like that in Crete, had its early, middle, and late periods. In obtaining this evidence many archaeologists participated. The American School played a role through its excavations in the Corinthian region at Korakou, Gonia, and Zygouries (in the exploration of which A. J. B. Wace was an invaluable collaborator), and through its joint sponsor- ship with the Fogg Museum of the excavations at Eutresis in Boeotia directed by Hetty Goldman. Swedish expeditions likewise contributed substantially through their work in Argolis, chiefly under the direction of A. W. Persson, at Asine, Dendra, and Berbati, in Arcadia at Asea, and in northern Messenia. Further tholos tombs at Dendra and Berbati and at Messenian Pylos were discovered, and numerous chamber tombs were found, especially at Asine, Dendra, and the Argive Heraeum. Much additional material of the Bronze Age was recovered at Eleusis by Kourouniotis and Mylonas, and the latter brought to light a cemetery of the Early Bronze Age at Hagios Kosmas in Attica. Fruitful results were obtained by the American School in the explorations of O. Broneer on the north slope of the Acropolis and in the great excavations of the Athenian Agora. At Thebes Keramopoullos exposed the surviving remains of a Mycenaean palace, containing a series of inscribed storage jars, and also investigated several cemeteries of contemporary chamber tombs. Remains of an important settlement that maintained its existence from neolithic times to the end of the Bronze Age were discovered beneath the temple of Aphrodite at Aegina. Supplementary explorations in Euboea and the Cyclades also yielded their quota of new evidence. Intensive excavations in eastern and central Crete shed much new light on early Cretan civilisation; and in Sir Arthur Evans' great work The Palace of Minos at Knossos, the Italian publications on Phaistos, and the French on Mallia, a well-rounded picture of the Minoan Age emerged. Work of exploration was extended widely into Macedonia, where many</page><page sequence="4">PRECLASSICAL GREECE-A SURVEY 19 sites of the Late Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age were discovered and excavated, especially by W. A. Heurtley. An Italian expedition un- covered a settlement of importance on the island of Lemnos, and an Early Bronze Age establishment that passed through five phases was excavated by Winifred Lamb at Thermi in Lesbos. An expedition sponsored by the University of Cincinnati undertook a fresh study at Troy (Hisarlik), where it conducted seven campaigns of excavation from 1932 to 1938. The eighty years of exploration, excavation, and study, which have been briefly summarised, and to which not only those mentioned but a great many other archaeologists contributed in devoted measure, have built up a consider- able knowledge of preclassical Greece. It is clear that two main eras of culture are represented, one falling in the Neolithic, the other in the Bronze Age. The deposits of the Neolithic Period are very deep at some sites, especially in Thessaly, where many strata give evidence that the culture lasted long and passed through many phases. Throughout its existence men lived in settled communities. Their houses were built usually with foundations of stone and a superstructure of crude brick, but we know relatively little of their ground plans. In some instances the settlement was surrounded by a fortification wall. Life was based on an agricultural economy: fields were cultivated and domesti- cated animals were kept. Almost no human burials have yet been found. Weapons, tools, and implements were made of stone, bone, and no doubt wood. Idols of stone and terracotta make their appearance in a characteristic steatopygous form. Simple ornaments of stone, bone, and terracotta are of fairly common occurrence. Hand-made pottery was produced in great abundance and in a broad variety of shapes and styles, plain and with incised or painted decoration. Some of the finest ware in a thin, delicate, red mono- chrome fabric is distinctive of the early phases, and there appears to be a progressive deterioration in the quality of the pottery towards the end of the period. In central and southern Greece, where few good sites have been thoroughly excavated, this culture manifests in its artefacts and pottery what seem to be local variations; one of the most striking features is the use of a glaze in the decoration of pottery, the so-called neolithic urfirnis. There are many unsolved problems, many questions that cannot be answered. The various phases have not yet been adequately differentiated, although since Tsountas' time it has been safe to speak in broad terms of a First and Second Period; nor have their relations, one to another, been fully clarified. In Thessaly itself the relationship between the Sesklo culture, First Period, and the Dimini culture, Second Period, has not been satisfactorily</page><page sequence="5">20 CARL W. BLEGEN ascertained; and the theory of an invasion from the Black Earth Region has not been established beyond doubt. No one has yet been able to explain clearly the connections between Thessaly on the one hand and central Greece and Peloponnesos on the other. The relation, if any, between the neolithic culture of the mainland and that of Crete is likewise still undeter- mined. It has not yet been possible to discover just how the neolithic civilisation came to its end and fell before its successor of the Early Bronze Age. No fresh excavations have been made in Thessaly since the work of Wace and Thompson nearly forty years ago; and all recent interpretations and theories are based on their and Tsountas' admirable observations. But much has been learned in the intervening years from other parts of the Aegean area that should be brought into comparison with the material from Thessaly and tested by fresh stratigraphic study. What is clearly needed now is a new excavation of some good site, an excavation on a relatively large scale, employing the latest methods of research and recording. In that way some of the many specific unsolved problems that can be answered today only by theory and deduction, founded on inadequate comparisons and supposed similarities, might well find their solution. It might be mentioned in passing that comparisons of pottery shapes and decorative motives based on photo- graphs alone are far less reliable as evidence than a study of the objects themselves side by side. In dealing with pottery the character of the fabric, which often cannot be seen in a photograph, may be of the greatest importance. When we turn to the Bronze Age we find ourselves on firmer ground, though here too there are numerous perplexing unsettled questions. The triple division is, however, solidly established by stratigraphic evidence, and we can speak with confidence of the Early, Middle, and Late Periods. The nomenclature too has now been pretty generally accepted on a geographical basis: the term Minoan, first suggested by Evans, is universally established for the remains and periods in Crete; the culture of the central Aegean islands is called Cycladic; and the name Helladic has in most quarters been adopted to designate the roughly corresponding periods and remains found on the Greek mainland. The problems in the Minoan area need not detain us, since they have been fully set forth by Pendlebury, and there is little to add to the survey given in his book The Archaeology of Crete. Passing over the Cyclades also we shall limit ourselves to a review of the state of affairs on the mainland. Though much supplementary information has come from many other sites, the Early Helladic Period is best known from the excavations in Argolis, Boeotia, and Corinthia that have been mentioned. The depth of the deposit at Eutresis exceeded four metres; at the Corinthian and Argolid sites it was more</page><page sequence="6">PRECLASSICAL GREECE-A SURVEY 21 than two metres; and everywhere it showed numerous habitation levels, implying that the period was a long one. Throughout it the inhabitants, like their predecessors, lived in communities or villages, engaged in agriculture, and raised cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Carbonised wheat has been recognised in a stratum of Early Helladic II at Eutresis. Houses were built with walls of crude brick supported on broad stone socles. Except for a large circular building at Tiryns, they exhibit fairly consistent rectangular plans, and some were of large size. No certain remains of fortification walls have been recognised. Burials of several types have been found: ossuaries, stone-lined cists like those of the Cyclades, and small chambers opening from the bottom of a vertical shaft. Alongside stone and bone implements, which continued to be used, tools and weapons of copper make their appearance. Gold and silver were worked into jewellery and ornaments, and three gold sauce-boats are known. Figurines of terracotta occur, anthropomorphic as well as zoo- morphic, of types quite different from those that prevailed in the Neolithic Period. The pottery, too, of excellent fabric and in a wide repertory of distinctive shapes, has a character of its own. A close kinship with Early Cycladic and Early Minoan is unmistakable; and the geographical distri- bution of Early Helladic sites suggests that the bearers of this culture entered southern Greece and gradually extended their dominion northward. The Early Helladic Period still offers many unsolved problems. At some sites the excavators, on the analogy of Evans' Minoan system, have ventured to distinguish three major subperiods which they call Early Helladic I, II, and III. These divisions are founded on a study of the stratification, and their local applicability at each site is unquestionable; but they have not yet been adequately correlated to permit a general application with any clarity of definition to the entire area. Writers who refer easily to Early Helladic I, II, and III are thus dealing with concepts that are still somewhat nebulous and ill-defined, and such generalisations must be regarded with caution. The difficulty is that Early Helladic deposits have not yet been sufficiently explored. The earliest strata have for the most part barely been touched, usually at the bottom of small deep pits that yielded relatively little material; and there has nowhere been an excavation of a large area on an adequate scale to allow the stratification to be studied with the thoroughness required. Such an excavation is an indispensable need for further progress in co- ordinating and correlating the phases of Early Helladic from site to site and in their broader relationship to the Aegean world. It might also yield much information, now lacking, to shed light on the manner in which Early Helladic civilisation displaced its neolithic predecessor, concerning which virtually nothing is yet known. How the Early Helladic Period came to its end is</page><page sequence="7">22 CARL W. BLEGEN likewise a subject that demands further investigation. At some sites a burnt stratum seems to indicate a thoroughgoing destruction; elsewhere a less violent transition has been postulated, with many survivals. One consider- ation of significance is the fact that a great many Early Helladic settlements were abandoned at the close of the period and never reoccupied. Remains of Middle Helladic culture are fairly abundant. In the settle- ments that have been excavated many houses have been uncovered and a distinctive style of architecture, marked by neat, narrow walls, is found. Rectangular and apsidal ground plans occur apparently side by side. No fortifications have yet been identified. Life continued as before, based primarily on agriculture and stock raising. Burials almost always are single interments in small, plain or stone-lined cists or shafts, sometimes in pithoi. Bronze has replaced copper for weapons and implements, though stone, bone, and terracotta were still used for various purposes. A new type of pottery, Grey Minyan Ware, is characteristic; and to it is soon added another, perhaps of Cycladic derivation, bearing decoration in matt paint. The introduction of the potter's wheel also falls in this period. The geographical distribution of the principal settlements supports the view that Middle Helladic culture was brought by invaders from the north, or more probably the north-east, perhaps coming by sea. In the course of the period, which must have lasted a con- siderable time, change and development can be traced, especially in the pottery. Contact was made with the islands and eventually with Crete; it was speedily followed by an intensification of relations which, towards the end of the period and in the next, led to a deep penetration of the mainland by Minoan culture. Whether this was brought about by a Cretan conquest or by the receptive borrowing attitude of the mainland population is still a disputed question. The Middle Helladic Period, so far as its internal division is concerned, is even less well known than the Early Helladic. Excavators have observed successive habitation levels; at some sites three main subperiods have been postulated, at others only two, but there is no convincing correlation from site to site over the Helladic area. It is thus premature and going beyond the evidence yet available to use the terms Middle Helladic I, II, and III as if they were established general concepts with validity for the whole Greek mainland. Apart from its origin, internal division, and the nature of its intercourse with Crete, Middle Helladic culture sets us many other problems. What is the meaning of the homogeneous culture in Troy VI ? How and when did it establish its supremacy over the mainland and some islands of the Cyclades? How did it dispose of its predecessors? Was it brought by a people of Indo- European-possibly early Greek-stock? Did they bring with them the</page><page sequence="8">PRECLASSICAL GREECE-A SURVEY 23 horse? What does the appearance of Mattpainted Ware mean ? How did the Middle Helladic evolve into Late Helladic civilisation ? Many of these questions may long remain in the field of surmise and speculation, but some of them could no doubt be answered by the thorough stratigraphic excavation of a good Middle Helladic site, large enough and with a sufficient depth of deposit to provide abundant architectural and other material in undisturbed sequence. The Late Helladic or Mycenaean Period has yielded far more archaeological remains than any of its predecessors: great palaces set within fortified citadels, numerous houses, large and small, frescoes, the Royal Shaft Graves, some forty tholos tombs, and many hundreds of chamber tombs, abundant works of art and jewellery in gold, silver, stone, ivory, faience, glass, etc., weapons of bronze, terracottas, vast quantities of pottery, and not of least importance considerable remnants of writing and of written records. Three general stages in the development of this culture, Late Helladic I, II, and III, have long been accepted as safely established, and their essential correctness can hardly be doubted. But, as has sometimes been remarked, almost no site has yet been found with a deposit that preserved clearly marked strata in a complete, undisturbed sequence convincingly representing these major stages. If stratigraphic evidence for the main divisions is thus awkwardly scanty, it is even more disconcertingly lacking for the many minor subdivisions that Furumark has recently set up for what he calls Mycenaean II and especially Mycenaean III. The latter period he separates into no fewer than seven phases: Mycenaean III AI, III A2 early, III A2 late, III B, III CI early, III Ci late, III C2. Observation of the stratification at Zygouries, Mycenae (Lion Gate area), Asine, and elsewhere had provided the basis for a triple division of the long period of Late Helladic III, and one may therefore refer with some confidence to Late Helladic III A, Late Helladic III B, and Late Helladic III C; but the more minute distinctions made by Furumark depend almost wholly on his reconstruction of a typological series of shapes and decorative styles and motives that he takes to illustrate the development of Late Mycenaean pottery. In its details the structure thus rests on subjective theory: it is a logical structure that has much to commend it, but it cannot yet be regarded as founded on ascertained fact, and stratigraphic evidence when discovered may still impose some modifications. There is for example an apparent discrepancy between the long chronology of 125 years assigned to Period III A, which is divided into three phases, and the much shorter span of 75 years allotted to Period III B, for which no subdivisions are proposed. This discrepancy is the more striking when one recalls that a far</page><page sequence="9">24 CARL W. BLEGEN greater amount of the pottery brought to light at Mycenaean sites must be classed as III B than as III A. The transition from Middle Helladic to Late Helladic is still shrouded in obscurity. At northern sites it seems to have been effected much later than in the south. No evidence from stratification has yet been found to bear decisively on this problem. Exactly how and how far the mainland area came under Minoan cultural influence is likewise a question that has not yet been fully answered. Mycenaean relations with the far north of Greece and with the Anatolian coast are still rather the subjects of speculation than of known fact. There are many other general as well as specific problems. Here, too, it is obvious that the systematic excavation of a fresh site might add much to supplement what is already known and to fill serious gaps in the record. But a site still retaining a substantial deposit, with its stratification unimpaired, will have to be sought with patience and care. If one exists and can be found at all, it deserves to be excavated with most attentive stratigraphic method. Nothing has yet been said about chronology which, though it is of course a thorny perennial problem in preclassical archaeology, is not a special concern of this paper. For the Late Helladic Period and its three major divisions, at any rate, there can be little doubt that the dating now widely accepted (e.g. by Furumark) is reasonably well attested and as nearly correct as one could hope to attain. For the Middle Helladic and Early Helladic Periods, however, the margin of error grows progressively larger, and the chronological limits of the Neolithic Period still remain highly uncertain. With the evidence now available almost the maximum has been done in the way of combination and comparison; and until our knowledge of those periods themselves and their subdivisions can be rounded out more fully, there is little prospect of decisive further progress. It is tempting on the basis of similarities and parallels and combinations to draw up broad corre- lations and equations, but when the evidence is scanty the danger of being led astray is great. It seems to me we have now reached a point when it is desirable and necessary to restrain speculation and imagination and to seek fresh evidence. Innumerable untouched preclassical sites still exist in Greece. Surely one or several could be found, perhaps in Thessaly, Boeotia, and the Peloponnesos, the systematic excavation of which in the light of present knowledge might yield answers to many of the problems that confront us. A new thorough exploration, especially with reference to the Neolithic, Early Helladic, and Middle Helladic Periods, could hardly fail to produce fresh information of value. No major excavation in this field has been undertaken for a decade. It is time to call on the spade again. CARL W. BLEGEN</page></plain_text>
