With reference to my paper on fi The Buddhist and Hindu Architecture of India," and the subse- quent discussion, published in the Journal of March 5, I should like to add a few remarks in order</page><page sequence="2">364 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March. 12, i9o9. to clear up various points which might seem to require further explanation. In the first place, having only one hour at my disposal to deal with a very extensive subject, I aimed at describing only actually existing monuments, and purposely refrained from going into questions of pre- historic and conjectural origins. Had I entered upon that domain I should certainly have stated my belief, which I have already expressed elsewhere, that the three types of Buddhist architecture, the Stupa, the Chaitya, and the Vihara, were only Buddhist adaptations of previously existing types of indi- genous Indian buildings, the latter two types having been wooden structures. Having for many years studied Indian institutions in ancient Sanskrit literature at first hand, I am certainly not one of those who believe that the early Aryan invaders founded all the Hindu religion, architecture and arts. On the contrary, I have pointed out in my " Vedic Mythology/' how, for instance, phallus- worship and snake worship must have been borrowed by the Aryans from the aborigines. As regards the exist- ence of temples, which, in any case, must have been of wood and very primitive, in pre-Buddhistic times, among the aborigines, it is a matter of pure conjec- ture. On the other hand, I cannot but believe that idols of a fetishistic order, though not of a sculptural anthropomorphic form, existed among them. As to the conjectural origin of ancient Buddhistic temple archi- tecture in India from the type of the pagodas of the hills I certainly share Colonel Hendley's doubts. We run the risk here of explaining the origin of the ancient Chaityas from structures of the present day which are not improbably the Nepalese descendants of those Chaityas themselves. It is not clear to me what Sir G. Watt means by speaking of the religion of the Atharva Veda as identical with Brahmanism. At any rate, it can hardly be said that in that Veda the old pantheon had been extended by the admission of earthly gods, spirits, and demons. These were equa'jV well-known to the Rigveda, as I have shown in my " Vedic Mythology," and elsewhere. To me at least it seems an improbable conjecture that, because Jains as well as Buddhists built Stupas, relic worship goes back to an early and common faith. In the first place, we do not know how much early Jainism was influenced by Buddhism. Again, these two religions were the first in India to originate from a personal founder. Relic worship would, therefore, naturally have first started in connection with them or one of them. I do not understand what can be meant by saying that the dharma , or ' ' book of the law," and the sangha , the i{ tree (?) or congregation " appear as symbols on the monuments. The chakra , or wheel, certainly appears as a symbol of the law, and the Bo-tree is, of course, very often represented in the early Buddhist sculptures. Again, the trident or trisul , which often appears, on the Buddhist monuments, is well known to be the dis- tinctive emblem of the god Siva also. It is, therefore, not clear what is meant by saying " that by certain Hindus (it) is supposed to belong to Vishnu." I have shown in my lecture at Oxford that some of the symbols occurring on Buddhist monuments can be traced as far back as the Rigveda. I am not one of those who share the opinion that the art displayed in the Karle Chaitya, with its elaborately carved Persian pillars, is " very rudimentary," a term which I apply to the conjectural pre-Budhistic art of five centuries earlier. My object in dwelling on the evolution of the Chinese pagoda was to demonstrate the connection between the funeral mound and the porcelain tower at Nankin by illustrating every step in the develop- ment. I fear I may not have done so in a convincing manner. Fergusson saw the connection, as I said in my paper, and distinctly states it in the passage quoted by Sir G. Watt. But he nowhere demon- strates the connection in any of his works, all of which are known to me, as far as I can discover. I gather that the demonstration of how the Indo- Aryan tower was evolved from the Stupa was not convincing either. It would, however, have been useful to indicate what the weak points in the argu- ment are. I have more evidence on the subject which there was not time enough to exhibit at my lecture. But I intend to adduce it elsewhere. Fer- gusson, as I have shown in my paper, states that the Indo-Aryan tower cannot be explained from any known architectural form. A. A.
