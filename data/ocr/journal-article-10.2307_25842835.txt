<plain_text><page sequence="1">Morris, Brian: Animals and Ancestors. An Ethnography. 256 pp., illus, bibliog., index. Ox ford: Berg Publishers, 2000. Animals and Ancestors is Brian Morris' second volume in a trilogy on the role of animals in Malawian culture and history. It is the sequel and companion volume to The Tower of Animals (1998) where the author discussed basic structures of Malawian society like matrilineal kinship, subsistence farming, hunting rituals, folk classifications of animals and people s attitude towards nature. The third book The History and Conservation of Mammals in Malawi (co-authored by Brian Walker) has not yet been published. In Animals and Ancestors the author looks at the role of animals in the life and the religious imagination of the peoples of Malawi. Morris bases his study on rich and overwhelming empirical data, but he is also conversant with relevant literature and the academic debate within the anthropological and the philosophical arena. The result is a book that not only presents facts but puts them into an interpretative, sociological and historical framework. The author presents his material in six chapters. In 1 Introduction Morris defends with great wit and intelligence his "philosophical" background and the methodology he uses. Against the common trend among "arrogant and intolerant postmodern anthropologists" (the study is enriched with humorous polemics against them) the author affirms "a realist ontology, the importance of truth and representation, human agency and empirical knowledge" (3). He also makes a strong argument for using the term "Malawi culture" in the singular following authors like Cullen Young, Alpers or Mitchell who stressed the cultural unity of the peoples now living in Malawi. Morris has gathered his data from extensive trips to all parts of the country, from interviews (or "chats" as Morris describes them) with herbalists, diviners, local hunters, and spirit mediums. He has visited various rain shrine sites and attended possession rituals; he himself is initiated into the jando (the Yao boys' initiation rite). Although most of his exposition is based on two years of field research (1979-1980 and 1990-1991), Morris can also draw on experiences of</page><page sequence="2">344 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 126 (2001) more than a decade that he has spent in Malawi. In addition, he is able to refer to the writings of Malawian authors who have written in the vernacular. Although Morris admits that the book does not have a "controlling thesis or argument" (27) and that it does not deal with the considered practices and representations in their totality (29), his "ramble across an ethnographic terrain" is a comprehensive study of the major Malawian ritual practices and cultural beliefs. It covers the matrilineal peoples of Malawi, the so-called "Maravi cluster" - Chewa, Chipeta, Nyanja, Mang'anja - as well as the Yao, Lomwe and Tumbuka, but does not include the Ngoni, Sena, Lambya, Ngonde, Europeans and Asians. In 2: Animals, Humans and PersonhoodMorris lays down the theoretical basis of his study. By showing the close relationship between man and animals throughout human history (and referring to his arguments in The Power of Animals with regard to the Malawian situation), Morris concludes that Malawians have a "complex, intimate and multi-faceted" approach to animals (34) which includes neither radical distinction nor "ontological" uniformity. As man and animals share many attributes (like sociality, consciousness, and subjective agency), an appropriate way to express this relationship is that "men and beasts are kin" (E.T. Seton). This is why even religious imagination is not only anthropomorphic (as common) but moulded by theriomorphic thinking. Morris continues with a philosophical anthropology fed by the Malawian concept of person (munthu) where he bids farewell to some exotic and generalizing concepts of personhood as prevailing in some anthropological circles. Morris insists that "personal being (self) involves a social identity that is wider in scope than cultural definitions of the person" (45). Whereas general anthropological characteristics (as the self, the relationship between the individual and the community, and roles in society) are shared by all human beings, the specific Malawian concepts come into play when talking about the understanding of the body (thupi) and its three particular parts, the belly (mimba), the head (mutu), and the heart (mtima), specific life experiences like conception and death, or disease aetiologies. As with regard to the relationship between the individual and the community, Morris stresses a balance. Social virtues like shame (manyazi), respect (ulemu), pity/compassion (chisoni), fear (mantha), or jealousy (nsanje) enjoy high recognition. Nevertheless, the individuality of a person and his/her own responsibility is highly appreciated and expected. Animals (as "kins") are considered showing some of these attitudes (like the elephants compassion or the baboons jealousy). "Thus Malawians do not make a radical distinction between humans and other animals, but nevertheless the human person (munthu) is seen as ontologically distinct from both wild and domestic mammals (nyamal chiwetalchirombo) " (68). In 3: Rituals of Childbirth and Womanhood Morris outlines the rituals of childbirth and womanhood, i.e. the menstrual (ndakula), the first pregnancy (chisamba) and the maturity (chiputu) rites. The main purpose of these rites is to impart on women how sexuality has to be used which is, at the same time, the affirmation of personhood and gender identity. The essen tial link to animals derives from the fact that sexuality - similar to food (meaty*nyama) - is a life-sustaining energy. The wild and untamed nature of animals supports this idea. In addition, animals live in the woodlands as do the ancestors. In the form of theriomorphic mask dancers, the ancestors visit the village in order to initiate the girls into their role of bearers of fertility. As sexuality is symbolically associated with blood and fire, so is the hunting experience. Hence, similar and analogous taboos and symbols are implied for both activities, i.e. sex and hunting. Hunters have to be ritually cool (i.e. having no sexual relations) as those who have to deal with ancestral involvement (like in rain prayers). The underlying concept of the distinction between</page><page sequence="3">Buchbesprechungen 345 ritually hot and ritually cool is crucial and a main domain within the culture of the Maravi cluster (as among other ethnic groups in Africa and elsewhere). The liminal stage (as transgressing from one stage to the other) is expressed, e.g. by the fact that girls during their initiation receive "bush names". It is interesting that the meaning and the symbolism of animals as employed in the different female rites of passage among the Chea, Lomwe, Yao or Tumbuka are so similar. It is to Morris's merit to embark - starting from empirical facts - on comparative studies of different ethnic groups in that field. 4: Boys Initiation andtheNyau Fraternities provides an overview of the initiation of boys in Malawi, focusing mainly on the jando of the Yao and the nyau of the Chewa (incl. Chipeta and Mang'anja) where animals and their theriomorphic appearance play a major role. Morris provides a comprehensive insight into the personage, the geography, the sequence of rituals, the symbols, and the songs as connected with the different rituals. The exposure to the "wild" woodland with its untamed and sexually active inhabitants is the crucial aspect of the initiation of the boys. Apart from the detailed information on the type of animals, the skins, materials involved, Morris discusses the significance of the most common animal structures that appear in the mask dance of the Chewa and the Yao. Given the fact that Nyao is often considered the main element of Chewa traditional culture and religion, Morris spends some time discussing the different theories to explain the gule wamkulu, as the "the big dance" is called in Chichewa (151-167). With critical and well established arguments he points out the strengths and weaknesses of the theories so far applied to gule wamkulu namely the historical, mythological, sociological and cosmological approaches. His arguments are specially interesting for all those who follow the ongoing discussion. They will hardly be able to escape his convincing arguments. Against a generalizing theological interpretation of Malawian rituals ("Malawian concepts are biocentric, rather than theocentric", [165]), Morris corroborates his main argument that the animal aspect is crucial for the understanding of initiation rites, i.e. gender identity and maturity. "It separates the girl from her mother, and the emphasis is placed upon her fertility and the setting up of her own home - or potential village. For the boy, a fundamental emphasis is placed on symbolically separating him from his mother and kin group and making him not so much a man, as an affinal male. The boy is identified with the spirits and animals, with the woodlands" (166). The complementarity of village and woodland, women and men, humans and spirits and the crucial role of animals in it is continued in the funerals and the concepts of "life after death". Morris concludes that the Malawi social life - against dualistic concepts among the Lugbara, the Merina or Bara - "prioritizes cyclic and transformative processes, and posits analogical associations between various modalities of social existence (hunting, the cycle of seasons, agricultural production, eating, human reproduction, iron smelting and beer brewing" [174]). 5: God and the Rain Deities is dedicated to the exploration of the concepts of God and rain deities in Malawi traditional religions and the role that animals play in it. Malawi religious concepts are focused on the ecological balance between the wet and dry seasons, between fire and water, and between hunting and agriculture. In the creation myths, fables and oral traditions animals like chameleon and lizard, spider and python are important protagonists. Especially in the territorial rain shrines complexes, both of the Chisumphi and the Mbona cluster - Morris challenges the clear distinction of both within the anthropological literature - a serpent spirit called thunga or nsato is crucial (napolo is another serpent mountain spirit in popular religion). As in almost every culture, in Malawi the snake is an archetypical image of the experience of the transcended. As Morris observes and explains, the snake's capacity to shed its skin, to live in</page><page sequence="4">346 Zeitschrift far Ethnologie 126 (2001) water and on land, and its power over life and death has induced the religious imagination of the Malawians especially at the occasion of rain shrine rituals to such an extent that finally the supreme deity (chiuta, chisumphi) is associated with the serpent spirit (chikangombe, nsato, thinga). In his last chapter The Ancestral Spirits Morris traces the way the spirits of the ancestors (mizimu) manifest themselves in different forms, and specifically in the form of animals. In contrast to chapter 4, the author discusses the nature of ancestral spirits rather than their function in society. He sees the transformation (kusanduka) of ancestral spirits into animals as a kind of metamorphosis and not an incarnation, i.e. a spiritual being takes the form of a bird, a lion, a buffalo, etc. and thus are dynamic carriers of the life-sustaining power. This concept is, as Morris insists, "neither mystical nor animistic" (30, 252). Malawians neither believe in an eternal soul, nor that animals have souls. The last part of the chapter gives an overview on the spirit rituals in the country (vimbuza, chisumphi, mambo, matzoka, nantogwe, chokwangali). Especially in rites of possession and the cleansing rituals the role of animals as "vehicles of dynamism" (252) it becomes obvious: the healer (singanga) embodying the spirits takes on the outward form of an animal (wearing skin, feathers, etc.), the spirits of the dead possessing individuals do so in the form of an animal (lion, python, crocodile), animals are given as sacrifices to the spirits, and meat or blood of animals are given as medicine to the patient. Animals and Ancestors has become more than a limited approach towards one segment of culture. It is a broad description of the Malawian culture covering major domains of anthropological research. When asked (or attacked) Morris insists that he is not so much a social anthropologist but somebody who is interested in nature and people and gathers information on that. Even if we assume this is typical British understatement, it is Morris's prime merit that he enters the discipline of anthropology through the backdoors of biology, zoology and botany. His earlier writings deal with mice and mushrooms, hunting and wildlife. His present field research in 2000/2001 is focused on insects in Malawi. Data from the natural sciences are an important and, among social anthropologists, a very often neglected area fun damental to the understanding of the social reality. Morris's Chewa Medical Botany (Minister: Lit 1996) is another excellent example how an understanding of disease and healing can only be established if herbs, plants and medicines are assessed in their natural context. This is Morris's unique position in the anthropological arena. Although Morris is a gatherer and hunter himself as with regard to data collection, he is nevertheless well versant in the theoretical discussion within his discipline. As he himself suggests, the composition of Animals and Ancestors lies midway between the two extremes of theory and description, comparative studies and data gathering. The book is well researched, well edited (I found only minor spelling errors), offers a valuable bibliography, and is written in a language that attracts attention avoiding academic jargon. Morris's personal humour is reflected in brilliant attacks against positions within social anthropology he does not agree with which adds to the book an argumentative element. The subtitle An Ethnography indicates where Morris sees his own competence and where he wants to hand over the baton. For me, the significance of animals leads automatically to the field of psychology, symbolism and theology. Why do Malawians employ exactly this type of animals for this ritual or for this song? What deeper associations and symbolic meaning are involved or connected with it? Especially the masks of the gule wamkulu carry many layers of significance. Here the interested reader is left a bit in the dark. We wait for a scholar who combines anthropological and psychological expertise to dig deeper.</page><page sequence="5">Buchbesprechungen 347 It might have been helpful to have a more detailed conclusion - Morris presents us with only one page. Morris's book is nurtured by an almost life-long acquaintance with Malawi, an excellent knowledge of Chichewa and all the anthropological literature published on Malawi. Animals and Ancestors might become a classic, not only on Malawi but as an example of ethnography at its best. Martin Ott University of Malawi, Zomba</page></plain_text>
