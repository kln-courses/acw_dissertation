<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Late Bronze Egyptian Garrison at Beth Shan: A Study of Levels VII and VIII, by Frances W. James and Patrick E. McGovern. University Museum Monograph 85, Philadelphia: The Uni- versity Museum, University of Pennsylvania in cooperation with the University of Mississippi, 1993. Volume 1, Text xxxii + 372 pp.; Volume 2, Illustrations 168 figures, 63 plates. $115.00. Levels VII and VIII, the major Late Bronze Age strata at Beth Shan, were excavated by Allan Rowe and Gerald FitzGerald for the University Museum (Philadelphia) be- tween 1921 and 1934. Although they published their find- ings promptly, the reports were very incomplete. Many of their conclusions were drawn subjectively and presented with insufficient supporting material. Coupled with the method of excavation and recording of the day, these early excavations have produced a legacy of confusion for the many Syro-Palestinian, Egyptian, Cypriot, and Aegean ar- chaeologists who have attempted to utilize this important site in their research. Fortunately, the clarification of the stratigraphy at Beth Shan became one of the driving ele- ments in the research of Frances James. Her early work (James 1966) had already brought order to the Iron Age sequence at the site, and she was deeply involved in a similar clarification of the Late Bronze Age strata at the time of her unexpected death in December 1985. Sub- sequently, the project was taken over by McGovern with the help and support of a variety of scholars (pp. xxvii- xxviii). The result of their work is a pair of handsome vol- umes that offer a very complete presentation of Beth Shan Levels VII and VIII, with the more enigmatic (and decid- edly mixed) Level IX only slightly touched upon in places (p. xxvii).</page><page sequence="2">1995 BOOK REVIEWS 89 A foreword (by Edward B. Sisson) and a preface (by McGovern) remind the reader of the history of the exca- vations, as well as the tremendous debt that is owed to the driving energies of Frances James. The material is pre- sented in 11 chapters (by McGovern/James except where otherwise noted). Chapter 1, The Stratigraphic Framework, presents new plans of the Late Bronze Age levels (Maps 1 and 2) that were reconstructed after a locus-by-locus reanalysis of the original records and artifacts. The material is arranged by level, type of deposit, and specific locus, complete with references to relevant recent publications. Where appro- priate, convenient summaries of suitable Egyptian paral- lels are conveniently woven into the chapter (pp. 25, 53, 57, etc.). Chapter 2, The Pottery: Typology and Technology, constructs corpora of the ceramic material from Levels VII and VIII by starting with a critical analysis of the most secure deposits and then expanding to those deposits with less stratigraphical integrity. The typology, arranged basi- cally by shape with appropriate published comparanda, is followed by sections on Ware Composition, Pyrotechnol- ogy, and Surface Treatment (with Garman Harbottle and Joan Huntoon, pp. 80-94), as well as Fabrication Meth- ods (with William D. Glanzman and Stuart J. Fleming, pp. 94-102). Chapter 3, The Mycenaean Pottery (by Vronwy Han- key), offers a catalogue of the "Late Helladic" imports arranged according to the typology for such wares deter- mined by Furumark (FS = Furumark Shape, FM = Furu- mark Motive), thus making the material more accessible to Aegean specialists. Thoughts on the position of the Beth Shan imports in the total scope of Aegean-Levantine commerce are included, as well as a note on chronology and an addendum on the small collection of Aegean im- ports found in Level IX. Chapter 4, The Cypriot Pottery (by Barry M. Gittlen), collects another major group of imports and discusses them according to the nomenclature familiar to Syro- Palestinian archaeologists and also the classification de- vised by Astrim. In this classification, for instance, a Base Ring II juglet can also be discussed as a "IXB lb" (p. 112), which makes the study more easily accessible to Cypriot archaeologists. A detailed commentary on the individual shapes and decoration puts the material in its ceramic and historical perspective and is followed by a catalog (also ar- ranged by level) of the Cypriot pieces that appear in the field records. Chapter 5, The Jewelry and Silicate Objects: Typology and Technology, presents these groups by object type (pendants, beads, etc.) and by fabric type (glass, faience, glazed pottery), as well as including a detailed study of Silicate Technology (with Charles P. Swan) that traces the use of these distinctive materials across large spectra of time and geography (pp. 152-63). Chapter 6, The Special Objects, discusses an eclectic group of specialty artifacts (anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic figurines, kernoi, stands, and wands, to name a few), while Chapter 7, Other Objects, Lithics, Bones, and Shells, treats a similarly wide range of faunal material, both with the same detail and thoroughness that character- izes every page of this volume. Chapter 8, The Typology and Archaeometallurgy of the Copper-base Artifacts (by Anne G. Bonn, Heidi Moyer, and Michael R. Notis), reports a variety of "scientific" analyses conducted on a wide array of metal objects, in- cluding those of a personal nature (kohl sticks, cosmetic spoons), as well as those with domestic (needles), agricul- tural (hoes, sickle blades), craft (awls, chisels) and military (arrow and spearheads) functions. Chapter 9, The Scarabs, Plaques, Seals and Rings (by James M. Weinstein), deals with the smaller Egyptian ob- jects in each level, including some pieces that were previ- ously unpublished, and offers a convenient concordance of published items not included in this chapter. The impor- tance of the Egyptian pieces for establishing the chrono- logical parameters of each level is added in a summary. Chapter 10, The Cylinder Seals (by Mary K. Dabney), reviews this important class of material which, although previously published, is here presented according to the stylistic classes (Old Babylonian, Mitannian, etc.) of the individual seals. The study is brought up to date and made more useful by the incorporation of the results of a great deal of recent research. Chapter 11, Historical and Cultural Synthesis, pulls this volume together making easy sense of the broad range of studies that it contains by presenting Late Bronze Age Beth Shan as the important cosmopolitan center it was. In summary, the efforts of McGovern and those who contributed to this volume have succeeded admirably in fulfilling his desire (page xxvii) that the work might stand as a fitting memorial to the scholarship of Frances James. In doing so, however, he has also presented us with a model for how important information can be derived from the sensitive, interdisciplinary examination of a previously published site.
