<plain_text><page sequence="1">P. D. Mastrodhimitris. Prooptikes ke prosenghisis: Meletes neo- ellinikis filoloyias. Athens. Nefeli. 1992. 262 pages. All but two of the nineteen short items that constitute the volume "Perspectives and Approaches: Studies in Neo- hellenic Literature" have previously appeared as articles and reviews in newspapers and magazines or were delivered as lectures at academic events. P. D. Mastrodhimitris's meticulous- ness as a researcher and skill as a commentator effortlessly show in all the pieces here, as they do in the fifteen or so philological works he has produced since 1970. In his preface the scholar explains his thesis, which actually emerges from most of the contents: namely, that the appear- ance of a new literary or critical work adds a new perspective to the field of critical study, and that any interpretation or use of this new text attempts to approach one or more points of this new perspective. In that spirit Mastrodhimitris adds all kinds of recently established details to such otherwise well-known and much-studied writers as Solomos, Palamas, Papadhiamantis, Cavafis, Kazantzakis, Karkavitsas, Prevelakis, Haris, Athanasia- dhis, and Vrettakos, as well as scholarly editors like Octave Merlier, whose restoration of Solomos's "Woman of Zakynthos" receives proper attention and worthy commentary. In my opinion, the most original and useful items in the book are the two essays on the poetry of the recently deceased Nikiforos Vrettakos, in which the "panharmonic language" of the brilliant lyricist and the "symbolic anthropomorphism" of his late collection are insightfully discussed. These two pieces are major contributions to the relevant bibliography, which is not distinguished by genuinely professional studies. The book is properly documented and features an index of names, titles, topics, and themes - as it should. M. Byron Kaizis</page></plain_text>
