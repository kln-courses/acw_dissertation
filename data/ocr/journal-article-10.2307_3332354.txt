<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAVAGE RUSKIN, by Patrick Conner. Detroit: Wayne State Uni- versity Press, 1979, 189 pp., $14.95. One of the great difficulties encountered in interpreting the work of Ruskin from a twentieth-century standpoint is adequately outlined by the "Master" himself in a lecture on the Greek Myths of Storm given at University College, London, in 1896. In discussing Greek myths, he remarks: "... for they are not conceived didactically, but are didactic in their essence, as all good art is." The same could be said of his own work. The strange mixture of allegory and reason exhibited in his writings has exercised the talents of many scholars during the eighty years that have passed since his death. Patrick Conner is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 one of the latest, and in his book he chooses to investigate the work of Ruskin "as a critic not a theorist, but as a judge of paintings, architecture and society." A difficult task, made doubly so by the need to reference the en- quiry not only to the world of criticism in the nineteenth century, but also to the seeming paradox inherent in much of Ruskin's statements and literary works. I enjoyed the informative content and elegance of style in this book very much, but had to ask myself, "Did it live up to the title?" Subsequently I had to conclude that it did not. The first reason is easy to explain. Mr. Con- ner has a gift for anecdotal reminiscence that, at times, obscures the point that he is trying to make. In a sense, the title of the book is an example of this in that the "Perfectly Furious Academician" was more a reflection of the satire of the magazine Punch than he was of reality. Ruskin was highly opinionated and idiosyncratic, but rarely savage just for the sake of it, and Mr. Connor's text seems to bear this out. The second reason is more complex and reflects the way that Ruskin worked compared with the manner in which his work has been viewed by others. He wrote and spoke more as a prophet than as an academic and like any prophet tended to polarize his thinking. His anthropomorphic style inclined more towards the sublime than the picturesque (and I think that the first chapter of the book would gain a great deal from a further look at this point) in his writing as well as his art, and coherence lay deeper in him than politics, religion, or even critical style. It has become usual to view Ruskin within the context of his actions rather than the quality of his mind; the approach of Wilenski compared with that of Rosenberg. Mr. Conner has a foot in both camps, and it is this fact that makes it difficult to determine the stance he is taking in his appraisal of Ruskin as a critic. I suspect that reviewing the private life of a prophet tells us very little about the nature of his pronouncements; but then neither does an academic ap- praisal. From the writings of R. G. Collingwood onward, a chronological causality seems to have been stamped upon Ruskin's life and works that the numerous commentaries upon Ruskin have escaped only with great difficulty, and this book is also haunted by the ghosts of his parents, Effie, Turner, Rose La Touche, et al., but not necessarily in that order. Any student of Ruskin as well as of writings on Ruskin (and this alone is a huge field) will be interested in Savage Ruskin for the wealth of detail that it contains. However, for it to have accomplished what it set out to do, I would have welcomed a much closer look at much less ground and also a decision whether this was to be a work for the Ruskin specialist or the specialist in art criticism. As it stands, I applaud the work of Mr. Conner for the wealth of inter- esting, well-annotated detail as well as for his attempt to give us a view of Ruskin that has not been attempted before. As a book for the nonspecialist it is bound to intrigue; in specialist terms I am sure that Mr. Conner is well able to write something on this theme that is tighter and more pointed. I will look forward to reading it if it is realized in the future. M. Steveni Birmingham Polytechnic, England</page></plain_text>
