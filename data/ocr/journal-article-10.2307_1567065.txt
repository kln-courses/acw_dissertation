Towards the "zero-degree machine" My recent interests have been centered on the idea of a zero-degree machine.' The term zero-degree in itself has no meaning; it has significance only in rela- tion to what I call a "hot state." In the type of symbolic space which is representative of the traditional composition of Japanese architecture, a hot meaning cultivated from the long process of history is con- densed. From the beginning of my career through the conclusion of my so-called first phase, I had been dealing with space which bears this hot meaning. At that point I turned toward efforts to create an "anti-space"2 in opposition to the type of space which carries this hot meaning. During the period of this second phase, the cube was my basic framework for de- sign. I frequently employed the adjectives inorganic, or neutral to elaborate this new mode of expression.3 My focus then was gradually shifting towards a cold space. Some time later I realised that my con- cept and method were moving into a third phase. I introduced totally disparate no- tions such as nakedness, machine, and savagery at various stages in the develop- ment and metamorphosis of my space, and zero-degree-machine is the term which best describes the present stage of this evolution.4 The shifts in my style of expression could be analogous to the phenomenon of morphological discon- tinuity known in biology as catastrophe: a sudden and rapid rupture of continuity in an organic process. Ambivalence in evolution A nation's tradition is an accumulation of the tangible realities in the everyday lives of its people. It was in response to the concreteness of these realities that I chose tradition as the starting point of my architecture. The fact that my works were then exclusively limited to residential de- sign had a particularly significant effect upon this choice. During my first phase, while I continued to feel affinity with tra- ditional Japanese space, I was deter- mined to extract its syntax logically. Syntax is itself one form of abstraction. I intended to discover, in the operation of the mind and its mode, the underlying characteristics of such everyday, concrete elements of composition as shoji, tatami, posts and beams, and distinctive roof shapes-all of which are said to be essen- tial characteristics of Japanese architec- tural space. For instance, I educed some elemental concepts such as the dividing- composition of the plan, and the frontality of the elevation, along with the charac- teristics of the schemata deduced from these concepts.5 These concepts and schemata became potent themes and methods for my space composition. The further the investigation went into the na- ture of concrete objects, the more clearly I could apprehend the underlying abstract structure. The development or evolution of my space was built upon this am- bivalent structure. Upon identifying these two concepts- dividing-composition and frontality-as basic features of traditional Japanese ar- chitecture (these concepts are applicable not only to architecture but to other for- mative arts as well), I sensed the exis- tence of their converse concepts: the connecting method of composition and three-dimensionality. At that time I also became aware that these converse con- cepts, or methods, are those which are essentially characteristic of the traditional composition of Western architecture. I worked with these pairs of phenomena in establishing the position and direction of my new themes. I recognized that these themes could adhere neither to Japanese tradition nor to that of Western culture. Cube and machine The cube, as one of the frameworks for expression in the modern architecture of the 1920s, had a direct analogy with the concept of machine. The cubic architec- ture constructed by assembling and com- bining industry-fabricated components had a close natural affinity with the imag- ery of the machine. In form, in function, and in their interrelationship, the analogy of the machine seems to have been quite effective in the creation of fresh images of new architecture. My cube was not analogous to the ma- chine. The cube became a main frame- work for expression during my second phase, which began around the end of the 1960s. The origin of this form and its con- cept could be traced to the space com- position of the House in White of 1966, designed when I was most deeply at- tached to the tradition of Japanese archi- tecture. Some years later, when I decided to shift to anti-Japanese space, I con- structed this framework for my new ex- pression by abstracting the form of the 44 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="3">Koji Taki 45 6 Shinohara, "Beyond Symbol Space", p. 87. 9 Kazuo Shinohara, "A Theory of Residential Architecture," The Japan Architect, October 1967. 7 Shinohara, "When Naked Space is Traversed". 8 Kazuo Shinohara, Shinkenchiko, March 1975. House in White. Another compositional framework, the fissure, which became a dominant plan characteristic, emerged from a similar process of abstracting form from earlier projects.6 My second phase, the architecture of the cube, was a framework for expressing an inorganic, neutral, or dry meaning. My cu- bic architecture was intended as anti- space-in contrast with the former works which corresponded so intimately with tradition-rather than as a direct analogy with the machine. There was no need for that kind of analogy which well explains the character of my second phase, or cube period. Naked objects "Posts, walls, braces; all of these express no more than their functions. The result- ing space which is made up of these elements does not convey any pre- determined or prescribed intents."7 This is what I wrote about my expectations in the design of the Tanikawa Residence in 1974. After having completed the development of my series of anti-spaces, I once again employed a traditional roof style and composition of posts and beams, in the Tanikawa Residence, this time intending to demonstrate the difference between this new style and the structure of the meanings included in the vocabulary of my first phase. (During my second phase I had designed another wooden structure, the Prism House, but this house was in all respects quite far removed from tradi- tional Japanese style.) Its components are fragmented objects conveying neutral and inorganic meaning, which are not as- sembled to constitute a unified concept of space. Upon entering this structure formed from naked objects, the observer can freely read from it diverse and infinite meanings.8 Such a structure could be re- garded as an apparatus for production of meaning. This structure, therefore, can be thought of as a machine. With the disap- pearance of my unconscious inclinations toward unity or symbolism-both of which were reminiscent of my cubic phase-my machine concept came into being. This machine exists in a different context from that of the machine in the twenties. I introduced this theme at the beginning of the seventies when the general current of Japanese architecture was retreating from an optimistic belief in technology and turning towards the art of meaningful space. In the previous decade, when this faith in omnipotent technology was be- coming prevalent in the Japanese archi- tectural scene, I manifested the opposing idea that the house is "art."9 I likewise proposed the machine as a criticism of the mainstream of the seventies as well as an homage to the brilliant spirit of the protagonists of the twenties in Europe. Anarchy as prototype A line of buildings of the most advanced technology and style is intermittently in- terrupted by old-fashioned buildings. Such abrupt gaps in continuity are char- acteristic of the streets of New York City. Buildings decorated with ornamentation from proximate historical periods, and the elegant and somehow soft surfaces of masonry characterize the streets of Paris. In Tokyo, which has a character resem- bling neither of these cities, the streets are filled with a chaos of forms and col- ors. In the typical townscape of Tokyo's commercial quarters, which could not be described as anything other than chaotic, I find a liveliness which I appreciate. What I appreciate is not the townscape itself but the structure of the chaos which gener- ates the liveliness. I substitute anarchy for chaos to suggest a progressive concept; Tokyo's anarchy is a prototype of the con- temporary metropolis, representing an energetic chaos whch most modern cities will sooner or later encounter. I defined my machine as an assemblage of fragmented components deprived of their customary implications, and as an apparatus constructed without any inten- tion of realizing a unified concept. I am deeply interested in anarchy because of its similarity to my definition of the ma- chine. The liveliness that I described indi- cates the existence of freedom as a prerequisite for a city and for its reading. If such an anarchic city were consciously planned and built somewhere, it could well be regarded as an apparatus rep- resentative of a mega-scaled space machine. It is because I believe I can give more freedom to my space by examining the capacity of this conceptual apparatus, as defined in the realms of both architecture and urbanism, that the zero-degree ma- chine persistently attracts my concern at present. Kazuo Shinohara Koji Taki 45</page><page sequence="4">Koji Taki 46 Preface It is difficult indeed to judge accurately the circumstances of contemporary archi- tecture as a whole, but among the many possible approaches toward an analysis we can outline one perspective by tracing the locus of an architect who has been producing his own very personal works without pause. This was my expectation while considering the whole range of Kazuo Shinohara's work, even though my aim is to concentrate on an analysis of the intrinsic structure in the works auton- omously developed by Shinohara. Kazuo Shinohara, who in the early 1960s made the statement that "Houses are Art," is an architect who has been assert- ing the crucial function of individual crea- tion, while remaining aware of the fact that architecture (or, in a wider sense, the Arts) is a socio-cultural phenomenon. The intrinsic structure of a work is the struc- ture of expression composed by the intrinsic architectural language. In Shinohara's case it must be described as an artistic structure, the function of which is to provoke people to discover unex- pected meanings. At first, Shinohara's recent works appear very much changed from those of his early period. There are always two dif- ferent qualities discernible in the works of an architect: one is variable, and the other invariable. Of the two, what impresses me most strongly in Shinohara's work is its predominantly invariable character. Gen- erally, what is judged to be invariable should be read by the viewer from the form of the works through the various pe- riods, but it is not always consciously or intentionally expressed by the artist; some aspects which go unnoticed by the artist, produce deep impressions in the viewer. It is my opinion that the key to a funda- mental understanding of Shinohara's work is to be found in the beautiful houses of his first period related to tradi- tion, which is highlighted by his House in White of 1966. As we proceed in the anal- ysis we will find in the development of later works the presence of concepts and elements from this period of traditional expression. 'Opposition' as a basic structure From Division to Opposition The originality of Shinohara's early works emerges in his relatively small indepen- dent houses, each with more than half of its volume occupied by a single large space. We can appreciate this style of "large space" at its most beautiful in the House in White. This house has generally been explained in the context of Japanese tradition. In fact, in that space we find the sublimation of a style refined through the tradition of an old culture in character- istics not to be found in Western ar- chitecture, such as ethereality, linear abstractness, simplicity and the particu- larly Japanese quality of frontality per- ceivable from within the room. However, I think that for Shinohara the large space is a House in White, 1966, plan.

In his search for a large space Shinohara was to discover a new kind of symbolic space reacting to the waning total self, which can be restored only through feel- ings, the unconscious mind, and the physical self; considerations which are excluded and regarded as anti-rational in modern architecture. I think it is appropri- ate to say that all of his works were devel- oped following directions suggested by this fundamental problem. This large space was a message from the architect to his contemporaries conveyed through the form of space. It is well known that during this search for a large space Shinohara had chosen to use the concept of division which he has extracted from the method of composi- tion inherent in traditional architecture; the plan in Japanese traditional architec- ture is not the result of the connection of independent units, but of the division of the plan by many straight lines. Each unit resulting from this division has an ephemeral life, in that it disappears as soon as the sliding partitions, which embody the division, are removed. Shinohara regarded the compositional method of Western architecture as one which was embodied in the concept of 1 House in White, schematic plan. connection, in contrast to Japanese di- vision. Throughout this early phase Shinohara was talking about Japanese traditional space as void. This voidness is a characteristic present in the whole of Japanese culture; a characteristic which we, as Japanese, cannot fail to recognize, no matter whether we confirm or deny its significance. It is natural that Shinohara, who was in love with traditional architecture, would intuitively grasp the geometric abstract- ness latent in division and conclude that he would perhaps be able to create a new kind of space using the concept of divi- sion positively, transcending the tradi- tional meaning of voidness. However, the large space was more than just the result of division. To clarify this point I will ana- lyze the method of composition in the House in White. Let me begin with an analysis of the plan, which is one of the simplest plans that could be imagined for a house; an abstract composition result- ing from the division of a square by a sin- gle straight line (figure 1). In the houses preceding the House in White, even in those with many rooms, the method of composition used was not that of connection but of division of the whole. But in these houses there already existed the origins of a space which would become the center. As for the possible association of division with simplicity, it must be said that, just as con- nection does not always lead to complex- ity, neither does division necessarily lead to simplicity. That Shinohara considered division a method directed toward sim- plification was in fact a product of his aes- thetic consciousness. The development of the concept of large space brought changes to the concept of division. In the House in White we find this method of division used to its limits to achieve sim- plicity in the large space. The strong op- position that can be perceived between this large space and the other parts of the house, as indicated in the plan, can be understood as evidence of a conceptual change from simple division into opposition. "Shell" and intersecting "p!ane" When the House in White was designed, the concept of opposition was not yet a main theme in Shinohara's work. The theme of opposition was hidden behind the theme of the large space; this is more apparent in the section than in the plan. The structure of the House in White con- c House in White, interior view of "large space". 47 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="6">Koji Taki 48 sists of a system of trusses forming a py- ramidal roof; a strongly centralized frame supported by a single column with four diagonal braces supporting the four beams ascending to the center. The inte- rior volume thus framed is divided by an off-center wall (vertical plane) and a ceil- ing (horizontal plane) defining a box- shaped volume which becomes the large space. The central column, located as it is-closer to the interior wall-does not appear to be central to the architectural whole. These wall and column elements are manipulated to create the important character of frontality in the room, and from this kind of fiction (in regard to ap- parent non-centrality) arises the symbol- ism of the large space (figure 2). 1 Jan Mukarovsky, Structure, Sign and Function (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978). Tanikawa Residence House in Ashitaka Architectonically, the House in White is a simply constructed shell divided by a ver- tical wall plane independent from the structure. This is the compositional basis used to establish, in the architectural whole, the large space bearing the mean- ing. The relationship between the shell, and the plane intersecting it appears re- peatedly in many of Shinohara's most im- portant works, with intentional variations in the structural system or the shape and number of walls. The Tanikawa Residence (1974), House in Ashitaka (1977) and House on a Curved Road (1978) are homologous to the House in White in that in each there is a shell which, traversed by a wall, defines a large space on one side and a sub-divided space to serve many functions on the other (figure 3). This does not mean that Shinohara's architecture had not changed through time, but it does point out one type of invariant which, being common to several works, appears in different forms while the architecture develops changing meanings. If we consider only the objec- tive form, we can interpret it as the inter- play between the structural (the shell) and the non-structural (the partition wall). When I use the term invariant I am refer- ring to the abstract relationship of opposi- tion which is common to the intrinsic structure in many works. This opposition in the composition of multiple elements in Shinohara's works is not a static rela- tionship but a dynamic one. I will later explain how this opposition becomes the center of a "meaning producing ma- chine." Some expressions peculiar to Shinohara like savagery and machine cannot be understood without consider- ing their relation to this concept of opposition. The symbolic meaning in opposition Appearing in a period in which residential architecture had largely lost what Jan Mukarovsky called the aesthetic function (the function of "provoking" culture),' the introduction of the large space in Shinohara's House in White brought this function to life again and called it to peo- ple's attention. He accomplished this through the reversal of the duality every- day/non-everyday, focusing on the non- everyday aspects which are beyond func- tionalism. Although this change in the re- lation was a dangerous adventure it did not mean the destruction of architectural form: it was the re-organization of archi- tectural thought through artistic thought. It is difficult to explain the strong feeling I get each time I see a work of Shinohara's, when I recognize the manifestation of an unconscious impulse of its author. This is the kind of impulse which makes a person build a tower on the earth's surface, an House on a Curved Road 3 Schematic sections of three houses. d 2 House in White, schematic section.

Jung, Man and His Symbols (New York: Doubleday, 1964). impulse which can be read as an ascen- sion impulse generated by the spatial re- lation created between the tower and the ground. We generally call this interpreta- tion of form symbolism. In this symbol- ism the relation of opposition plays one of the fundamental roles; as in the pre- vious metaphor with the tower, the as- cending movement gives birth to the relation between the tower and the earth's surface. The opposition sensed in the relation between the tower and the earth results from a basic human im- pulse; through this opposition we can feel the ritual re-creation of the world sym- bolically. The opposition which I feel in Shinohara's sophisticated and rather as- cetic expression results from the impulse concealed in the forms which he creates, and thus, through this opposition a sym- bol can be read in a simple plan. Certainly the distinguished research by Mircea Eliade2 on religious symbolism made it clear that in traditional society, not only in sacred architecture but also in the profane, "to build" means to recreate the universe, and that houses are "imago mundi." The problem, as C. G. Jung points out, is that we have enough knowl- edge of symbols but we do not "live" them.3 When Shinohara stated that he tried to make people discover something through his large space he was referring to the act of living the symbols. The main theme of the House in White, then, was the sacralization of the dwelling. In con- trast to this, some contemporary trends in architecture-creation through the recyc- ling of iconographies from anthropology and ethnology-seem ineffective, no mat- ter how charming images like those of a mandala or anthropomorphic forms might be. Man cannot preserve the eter- nal theme of this symbolism except through the contemporary forms of ex- pression corresponding to each era. Interdependence between interior and exterior: The Uncompleted House The Reversal of Space The Uncompleted House (1970) is com- monly known as the first reinforced con- crete work marking Shinohara's departure from tradition. Completely new aspects appear in the plan and the interior com- position. While the intersection of the shell by the plane in the House in White was nothing but a compositional method without any special meaning, the whole architecture of the Uncompleted House is traversed at its center by a space sand- wiched between two planes. Here opposi- tion becomes clearly apparent. These changes were not brought about by only one cause but by a complex relation of causes made up of impulse, manipula- tion and many other related factors. Shinohara strove to express completed- ness in making these large spaces. This completedness symbolizes the meaning of inner life in opposition to the outer world, and Shinohara regarded this op- position as the result of an aggressive stance against the outer world. The outer world that Shinohara faced was dominated by a critical situation which had developed in the whole of Japanese society from the end of the 1960s through the beginning of the seventies. On the one hand, architects, favored by a pros- perous situation, were able to talk freely and frequently about futurology. On the other hand, internal criticisms of the whole culture were developing as political disputes, putting the whole society into an unusual state of tension. The opposi- tion of Shinohara's work to the world was related to this crisis. He recognized this situation through a very particular per- spective of his own. A work of art is closely related to its author's intuition, conscious or unconscious, of the crisis of the period in which he is living. In his work, the exterior invading the inte- rior, creates a deeper interior, calling to the impulse in the inner man. The inter- nalization of various external crises is one of the important factors which produced the Uncompleted House: at that moment the architectural form appeared as what Kenneth Burke called a "stylized solution" to the external critical situation, a solution which is beyond the simple expression of the crisis of the era in architectural terms. Today, after 10 years' time, we are sur- prised when looking back to the architec- ture of that period, that it is difficult to find works which, like Shinohara's, in- scribed the socio-cultural crisis in archi- tecture. But Shinohara never thought of giving expression to the crisis itself or di- rectly committing himself to the situation. The paradoxical truth is that the more au- tonomous a work is, the more it becomes a product of its era. As I have said before, the architectural concepts that Shinohara had originated were structured through the relation of opposition, and his inner impulses were projected into this conceptual structure 50 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="9">KojiTaki 51 of opposition, manifested between the two kind of spaces: those functional spaces composing the whole house and the particular one traversing it in the Un- completed House. We see a large square- shaped space being traversed at its center by a slit swollen into the shape of a smaller square; we can also think of this method as the division of a square result- ing from two symmetrical staggered walls (figure 4). Looking at figure 4 we find that the space A, enclosed by the two walls, has with the other parts B, on both sides, a reversal relation similar to that of the positive and negative in a photograph. The small space A in the center is sensed as a plugged-in space which is simultaneously in opposition with and yet inseparable from the rest (spaces B). The same type of spatial composition appears in the Shino Residence (1970), the Cubic Forest (1971), and again, although changed to some ex- tent, in the Repeating Crevice (1971) (fig- ure 5). This kind of space is what Shinohara 4 The Uncompleted House, schematic plan. g Uncompleted House, 1970, interior view of space "A". B Koji Taki 51</page><page sequence="10">Koji Taki 52 called a "fissure space." He explained that this fissure space concept in the Uncom- pleted House was the result of the to- pological manipulation of reversal in the design of the Yamashiro Residence (1967), after the House in White and be- fore the Uncompleted House, in which the building surrounds a courtyard space. This concept of topological reversal pro- vides a clue to the interpretation of the spatial composition of the Uncompleted House. At the center of the Uncompleted House is a space with a square plan similar to the outline of the general plan. Standing at the center we feel as if we are again experiencing a solid, having already per- ceived the building as such from the exte- rior, but this time the mass is perceived as the exterior turned outside in. Conse- quently the relation between spaces A and B is not only one of opposition but also one in which the whole is turned in- side out, creating a relation between the original interior B and the internalized ex- terior A. To bring the exterior into the inte- rior and establish it as the architectural center would not have been possible without the geometric operation of to- pological reversal. While the opposition mentioned in the preceding section is an invariable abstract spatial relation brought about by the au- thor's unconscious impulses, the reversal process points to the conscious operation giving birth to changes in the forms. In his works there are many other opera- tions of this kind besides that of reversal. Establishing relationships between his works permits a better reading of the h Shino Residence, 1970, interior.

This reversal operation resulting in the in- ternalization of the exterior only becomes possible when a firmly fixed geometric form becomes the basis of the operation. Although the geometric abstractness of the perfect cube was not yet realized in the exterior of the Uncompleted House, at least the concept of geometric wholeness was already established. Thus it can be said that, what Shinohara called fissure space is something inseparable from the architecture of the cube. Abstract and concrete space The exterior form of the Uncompleted House was still ambiguous. Here the slop- ing roof reminds us of the exterior formal characteristics that appeared when Shinohara remained close to Japanese tradition, such as in the House in White. In order to compose the interior space in the Uncompleted House there was al- ready present the necessary geometric exterior, even if at this stage it is only imaginary; this geometric exterior actu- ally appears only in the plan. The plans of the Uncompleted House, the Shino Resi- dence, and the Cubic Forest were all per- fect squares. The selection of the square means that Shinohara was, at that time, feeling the necessity of clearly distin- guishing his expressed things from the unarticulated world-at-large. His con- scious intent was to find an architecture in which meaning is generated by the in- terdependence of the many components of his expressed things. The task of ob- taining a key to the metaphors with which to read the world from the net of relations in this intrinsic structure is a task en- trusted to the interpreter. Although the square is potentially loaded with symbolic meanings, Shinohara chose it because of its complete and geo- metrically pure form. In the Cubic Forest the architectural exterior is actually con- tained within a cubic geometric solid. In this house the inclined roof and deep eaves of Japanese traditional architecture have disappeared completely. The geome- try manifested in Shinohara's exterior form brought order into the limits of his clearly expressed things. The symbolized wholeness, completedness, and auton- omy that we sense in his architecture are all characteristics of an artistic approach to architecture. This approach was the re- sult of Shinohara's attempt to reinterpret this architectural prototype, the cube, through an artistic rather than a func- tionalist thought. The exterior of not only the Cubic Forest, but also of the House in Kugahara (1972) and the House in Higashi-Tamagawa (1973), all indicate that the abstract, geo- metric space representing the whole closely coincides with the concrete archi- tectural space, but that these entitites are not entirely identical. In any of these houses the cube is virtually an expression of the whole. The walls with openings are recessed from the walls at the perimeter of the abstract cube; the cube appears to have been cut away to separate the blank walls from those with openings. As a re- sult the geometric space wrapping the whole and the deeply articulated concrete architecture itself can be perceived as separate. This becomes clear through a schematic drawing of the facades (figure 6). In each of these examples the perime- ter wall and the walls with openings reject each other like the positive and negative in a photograph, filling up the rectangular frame. The surface of the perimeter wall is a cut- away "gestalt." This gestalt, sometimes symmetrical and at other times asym- metrical, may elicit many associations. For example, it can look like the stylized design of a tree. The associations are free, but what is important is that this gestalt already suggests the abstractness of the geometric space in contrast to the con- creteness of the architecture. Shinohara's cubic architecture, through its geometric abstract space, generates an architecture with concrete existence, completely re- leased from traditional sensibility. Meaning and experience The square-plan center space of the Un- completed House expresses a strong ver- ticality. This space is further verticalized by the effect of light spilling down from the dome-shaped skylight. Protruding from one wall are the outlets for the air conditioning system, and on the upper part of both sides of the space are interior windows, making it possible to look down into the space from the upper level rooms. There is no real function assigned to this space. Shinohara has said that he decided on the paradoxical name "Un- completed House" because it seemed to him that the central space itself expressed an important meaning beyond that of "house"; this meaning became clear to him just before everyday life entered this 53 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="12">Koji Taki 54 The center of the Uncompleted House is a cavern. When trying to interpret the archi- tecture in terms of living functions, the central space appears to perform the role of mediating and unifying the parts con- taining the living functions, thus provid- ing the means by which we are able to perceive the intrinsic structure of this house. Again, using the photographic analogy, the role of the central space is that of the negative bringing the positive into being. But, in the artistic meaning, the "negative" and the "positive" are complete reversals of each other, and thus, the central cavern begins its positive existence in its voidness. The ephem- ereality that Shinohara had sensed before in traditional Japanese architecture had at last disappeared from his own works, to- gether with the use of traditional materi- als and elements. The Uncompleted House and the series of houses following it are, among Shinohara's works, the group which most seductively invite metaphorical interpretation. The Un- completed House, Cubic Forest, and Re- peating Crevice are already metaphorical names with subtly different meanings. When a real architectural space is experi- enced as metaphorical space, the experi- ence itself is not induced by the physical structure but by the poetic structure of space. In the House in White, the viewer is captured by the frontal wall and the col- umn more than by anything else. This is an experience of gazing quietly, like the feeling that we have when sitting in a Japanese-style room in front of the tokonoma (decorative alcove); this is a kind of visual experience which is not to be found in the Uncompleted House. Looking inside from the entrance of the Uncompleted House we see the central space through a narrow slit which, once traversed, leaves us at the bottom of that tall space; the movement of one's own body brings about the dramatic ap- pearance of this space. But this is not all: in a space endowed with such strong ver- ticality, the height itself gives birth to meaning, but this height-in reference to the scale of the viewer's body- becomes transcendental and itself bears meaning. The visual coercion experienced in the House in White is no longer perceptible in the Uncompleted House. Topos and architecture: The Tanikawa Residence A new reading of the House in White The Tanikawa Residence (1974) was Shinohara's new reading of the House in White, transformed through his experi- ments, up to that point, in his evolving sequence of architectural concepts and contexts. In this house Shinohara concep- tually freed architecture from the sym- bolic meanings which had previously been so important in his works. The artist brought the House in White to a new con- text, and a completely new concept ap- peared in the Tanikawa Residence. Built on a gentle slope in the middle of a high- land forest, the house has a simple barn- like shape with a large 45 degree pitched roof. Its most unique characteristic is that the earth is left exposed in the interior-it is important to note that the earth floor, in this context, is in no way related to the traditional Japanese folk house vocabu- lary, in the way that it is used in the House with an Earthen Floor (1963) and in the House of Earth (1966)-not only the natu- rally sloping topography of the site but the bare earth surface itself is exposed. The slope in this interior is one of the ele- ments defining the character of the space; I will explain more about this character later. In the space within the Tanikawa Residence, Shinohara brought to light, after almost eight years, the whole struc- ture hidden above the main room of the House in White. The structural elements are exposed naked; the artistic fiction of the House in White has disappeared along with the traversing wall and ceiling (figure 7). These naked structural elements, though obviously derived from the House in White, are here expressed much more concisely, consisting of individual posts from which spring braces supporting the roof plane. In the House in White the structure was endowed with latent meaning in its strong centrality; in the Tanikawa Residence, however, to elimi- nate this centrality, the roof was changed to a linear gabled roof. The gabled roof, as compared to the pyramidal roof, is rel- atively lacking in unity, wholeness, and completeness. Consequently there is no longer a column holding a central posi- tion, as was the case in the House in White. Here, instead of just a single braced column, there are several in a row (figures 3 and 7). space, before it actually became a house. 7 Tanikawa Residence, schematic section. 54 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="13">Koji Taki 55 !

This is not only a rep- etition of the simple space division of the House in White but a stronger indication of the opposition, everyday/non-everyday (figure 3). In this house, too, the basic meaning is perceptible through this op- position. There are no longer any living functions to be found in the non-everyday space. The sloping floor appearing in this non-everyday space emphasizes the sa- cred quality. Another new characteristic of the Tanikawa Residence is that the roof slope is set at a 45 degree angle, a much steeper slope than the roof of the House in White. Meeting at the ridge, the two 45 degree slopes result in a right angle. In the Prism House and the House in Seijo, preceding this house, the roofs each have one slope set at 45 degrees (figure 8), but it is only in the Tanikawa Residence that the fundamental geometric form of the right angle appears for the first time. Thus the right angle here is not poetry, as it was in Le Corbusier's vocabulary; instead, it was used to emphasize the value of ge- ometry rather than that of emotion. A remarkable design departure from the large space in the House in White is that the traversing wall no longer produces frontality. There is a sense of imbalance produced by the inclined plane in this space, but, just as a slope in a city street has both an ascending and descending meaning, what is significant here is the disappearance of any simple direction which completely controls the meaning in this non-everyday space. Thus here exists the fundamental requisite for the genera- tion of multiple meanings. The meaning of topos The difference between a building situ- ated on a flat surface and one built on a slope is that the latter must absorb the topography of the site within the build- ing's shape. In dealing with this aspect, the architect is made more conscious of Nature, or at least is unconsciously influ- enced by the earth, or topos (the meaning of place). The House in Seijo (1973) preceding the Tanikawa Residence is also a large roofed structure situated on a slope. Under the roof there is a huge split-level one room o House in Seijo, 1973, exterior. 8 Schematic sections of houses with 45-degree roof pitch. LHoe in House in Seijo space, beneath which is another level housing several different functions. In this case one slope of the roof has a 45 degree inclination while the other is much more gently sloped. Here, the 45 degree angled plane was not something consciously sought through geometry; it appears to have been set at that angle in direct re- sponse to the site slope. The 45 degree slope meets the floor directly, emphasiz- ing their mutual relation; the vertical wall which normally mediates between roof and floor has disappeared. In the Tanikawa Residence this direct relation between the roof and floor is modified by a vertical glass wall, but the same impres- sion of directness is maintained. Concerning the floor in the House in Seijo, the site slope is absorbed by a hori- zontal floor split into two levels, a natural disposition for performance of everyday functions. In the Tanikawa Residence, be- cause of the right-angled roof we do not feel as we do in the House in Seijo that the site slope is reflected in the roof shape. The roof and the topography are independent, leaving the earth's surface free to appear just as it is in the inte- rior-free of preconceived meaning. It could be said that Shinohara, in his thirst for naked things, was compelled by the expectation of discovering a new meaning from the resonant relation be- tween these many exposed elements. The deep black slope of earth under this large shelter can be interpreted in a variety of ways. In this design Shinohara came to think that meaning emerges through peo- ple's reading of architecture-meaning is not a property of architecture itself. It is from this concept of architecture as a gen- erator of meaning that Shinohara's meta- phor of the machine appeared. I think that the untouched slope appear- ing before Shinohara at the site of the Tanikawa Residence must have appealed to a deep level of his unconscious mind. Architecture is always built in a given location, whether in the chaotic envi- ronment of the city or in the pristine en- vironment of nature. Both environments have the potential to stimulate human emotions before any specific building de- sign is conceived for the site. With a site in a natural environment, the topography and vegetation become matters for con- sideration. It is possible to guess that in the case of the Tanikawa Residence the inclined plane secluded in the forest tempted an unconscious impulse. Considering that Shinohara's solution Prism House 56 z__ Koji Taki</page><page sequence="15">Koji Taki 57 was to introduce the slope just as it was inside the architecture, we cannot help being reminded of what Shinohara said years ago about introducing into architec- tural space an artificial nature. In the Tanikawa Residence there appears unex- pectedly a new form of the artificial na- ture of which Shinohara had spoken. Although we can grasp the reality of the earth in the Tanikawa Residence, Nature is even more conceptualized here than in his previous works, where it remained hidden. The concept of earth here re- minds us of that used by some contempo- rary earthwork artists. I do not think Shinohara was motivated by the already highly valued concept of ultimate nature in oriental aesthetics. However, while contemplating the Tanikawa Residence, standing inside on this black earth or in the forest sur- rounded by snow and looking through the trees toward the house, I came to feel that latent in this house was a kind of sacral- ization of topos, in the same way that the House in White was a sacralized place for living. This topos is for me a sanctuary of "genius loci." To the zero degree in meaning Generative form and the city The characteristics-of the House in Uehara (1976) become distinct when com- pared to Shinohara's cubic architecture. When analyzing the cubic architecture I represented the plans graphically with the reversal indications of positive and nega- tive filling the rectangular frame as in a photograph (figure 6). Analyzing the cubic architecture in a volumetric sense, the geometric abstract space is conceived as a conceptual whole containing concrete space. Whereas the exterior perimeter wall in the cubic architecture performed the part of the positive figure in the ge- stalt, we find that the same kind of posi- tive figure has become autonomous in the House in Uehara (figure 9). In this house a large cantilevered volume projects out from one side, resulting from the functional necessity of creating a car- port by carving usable space out of the densely packed mass of a crowded neigh- borhood; here the expression of the can- tilever is different from the intentional formal meaning of the cantilevered form of the House in Hanayama No. 3 (1977) extending out over the hillside. If we think p House in Uehara, interior during construction. of the House in Uehara as having been born with the impulse of making the pe- rimeter wall independent from the shape of the cubic architectural whole, we can view this design as the birth of a new pro- cess of shaping architecture without a frame which makes the whole imagin- able. I tentatively call this new process a "geno-form"; a form that generates meaning. This generative characteristic of the archi- tecture of the House in Uehara became clear after the semi-circular vault had been mounted on top without any formal coherence with the lower part. Here, in contrast with the previous system in which an existing whole was divided, we have a process which generates a new total form each time an element is added into the composition. We can identify this as a system consisting of the indiscrimi- nate gathering of differing elements. Thus, the House in Uehara is a fully devel- oped expression of the new architectural concept which had just begun to appear in the Tanikawa Residence. The intent be- hind this conversion to a geno-form was to free architecture from anticipated meaning. It was not intended that the de- sign would start from a symbolic mean- ing; the generation of meaning was left to the relationship between the meaning- free elements in the intrinsic structure (figure 9). In the same way that the Tanikawa Resi- dence signifies a particular relationship with the nature in which it is located, I think that the House in Uehara expresses an essential relationship with the colossal urban environment of Tokyo. To avoid misunderstanding, I want to em- phasize that Shinohara was not in any way thinking about seeking affinity with the neighborhood. The surprising clarity of the House in Uehara stands in distinct contrast to the almost amorphous houses surrounding it. Although the world of the city has increasingly attracted Shinohara's interest because of its reality as a sym- bolic order extending beyond architec- ture, he feels no motivation to resolve the so-called urban problem actively. Kazuo Shinohara uses, as a metaphorical re- source for architecture, his intuition of the eternal exchange between order and dis- order, the sacred and the vulgar, and the continuity and discontinuity which consti- tute the vital recreative power of the city. But his architectural images have not been contextually derived from the city. Consistent with Shinohara's iconoclasm, the design of the House in Uehara shows House in Uehara House in Hanayama No. 3 9 Comparison of projecting forms.

House in Uehara House under High-Voltage Lines 4 Roland Barthes, Le Degre Zero de IEcriture (Editions du Seuil, 1953). no thought of injecting a sign into the context of the city. This architecture is based upon a system, which I have termed geno-form, in which the only determining factors are the con- trasting relations between elements, and in this sense this system is an architec- tural simulation of the city. It was an archi- tecture intended to express through form the symbolic order in the city. The essen- tial characteristic of this system is similar to what Shinohara called savagery. The geno-form here was not simply a play be- tween different geometric figures. It must be said that if architects give importance to formal play, infinite variations of style would be possible in a process without rules, and architecture based only on for- mal play would lose the ability to produce meaning. Shinohara's concept of geno- form appears as a criticism of this process of formal play. When Shinohara pro- claimed that houses are art, it was a pro- nouncement delivered as a challenge to modern society; therefore, in a period when mainstream house design was too infatuated with the play of forms, Shinohara turned to inorganic composi- tion in an attempt to remain closer to the essence of art. The Role of Structural Elements It goes without saying that the impor- tance of the House in Uehara is not only a matter of external appearance. Undoubt- edly, as we have seen, at the basis of Shinohara's impulse the power of savag- ery was clearly apparent in the city of Tokyo. But it must be noted, that in order to establish this kind of form, the struc- tural elements were assigned an unprece- dented role. It is clear that the structure resulted from architectonic necessity, and that the form is dependent upon the structure. This correlation is natural; but beyond that, what could be the reason for having the structural elements stand out so conspicuously? At the beginning of this essay I identified the concept of opposition as an invariant appearing through many of Shinohara's styles. Although each of the various styles had a meaning in its own time, if we ex- amine Shinohara's development over a long period of time we find him moving toward the elimination of meaning. Us- ing a metaphor from Roland Barthes, Shinohara is approaching a zero-degree style.4 Looking back, the Tanikawa Resi- dence and the House in Uehara seem al- most unimaginably distant from the meaning-laden space in the House in White. In the course of time, Shinohara ultimately manifested his rejection of a world full of superficial meaning. If there existed an approach to the zero-degree of style-a style in which the image is the meaning-then it would follow that the role of the structural and functional ele- ments would come into dominance. It was from just such an approach that the invariant relation in Shinohara's architec- ture-opposition, with its fundamental ab- stract relations- revealed itself as the core of the mechanism generating meanings. The elements themselves had important mutual relationships, and when they came to perform the role of cog-wheel in the meaning-producing machine, it was natural that this zero-degree style ap- proach began to assert itself. In the House in Uehara, it appears that in the design process the decision to use the cantilever came first, and that the search for the overall structural system followed. Shinohara was here aiming at a solution using both a column-beam structure and a bearing-wall structure-a complex hybrid structure resulting from the com- bination of a ferro-concrete system, the counterpart of the wooden column- support structure in the Tanikawa Resi- dence, with the bearing-wall structure of his cubic architecture. In the House in Uehara, the supporting columns with di- agonal braces, which Shinohara had first exposed in the Tanikawa Residence inte- rior, became a group of larger and smaller braced columns in parallel rows of three each. These columns and walls together defined a large shell. This complexity can be visualized through the patterns of the columns and braces exposed in the exte- rior walls. The diagonal elements in the larger columns serve as the cantilever support structure (figure 10). In the House in White and in some of the projects which followed it, the element that was used to traverse the shell was a vertical plane producing the opposition between the everyday and non-everyday parts of the architectural space. As it is not necessary here to emphasize this kind of opposition, the element traversing the shell is now nothing more than a planar element functionally dividing the interior of the shell and establishing a physical opposition between the plane and the shell. In the House in Uehara this planar element became the horizontal plane of the main floor, intersecting the main row of columns just at the point where the di- 59 Koji Taki</page><page sequence="18">Koji Taki 60 agonal braces spring from the columns, resulting in the simple division of the ar- chitectural volume into two levels. In the second story the columns and diagonal braces appear exposed, impressive in their size and dominance (figure 10). But what we see here was not done for the sake of expression-it is nothing but a fragmentary index to make people per- ceive the whole composition, no matter where they stand within the space. It is not only that the physical composition is naked, but also that the elements appear scattered everywhere, to be perceived only as parts or fragments of the whole; each of the primary elements begins to take on the function of a synecdoche. This is not metaphorical space; no meaning exists prior to our encounter with the space itself. It is within this space that we find the geno-form which Shinohara called savagery. Both the House on a Curved Road (1978) and the House Under High-Voltage Lines (1981) can be understood in the same way as the House in Uehara. In the former there is a hybrid structure like the shell of an egg internally supported by columns and beams arranged in the form of linked parallel crosses in the interior. The trav- ersing wall divides and defines the inte- rior volume, but without the frontality found in the wall of the House in White, this wall is nothing more than a partition. The large space here is not invested with meaning, but it does serve as a "topos" for the performance of relations between the structural elements (figure 3). In this large space there appears the dramatic encounter (i.e. opposition) between the vertical wall traversing the whole house and the highbeams penetrating the wall. The House Under High-Voltage Lines re- sembles the House in Uehara as a hybrid structure of columns and bearing walls traversed by horizontal planes (figure 10). Epilogue The locus of Kazuo Shinohara's architec- ture and architectural concepts begins to come more clearly into focus after at- tempting this correlational analysis of his works from the 1966 House in White into the 1980s. From the beginning, when Shinohara first introduced the large space into the vocabulary of traditional Japanese space, he developed his works according to his own perspective, re-reading architec- tural thoughts into artistic thoughts. The voidness in Japanese architecture was transformed into a symbolic entity, and geometric space was made to repre- sent the autonomous whole of architecture; furthermore, through these processes came the attempt to express symbolically the savagery of the city through the de- vice of the geno-form. In Shinohara's work all of this took place without diverg- ing from the basic premise of architec- ture. Shinohara's concern for the city was not prompted by issues relating to the so- cial aspects of architecture, nor did it derive from an interest in the various images of architecture as perceived by society in general. For Shinohara, archi- tecture has been from the very beginning a problematic quest concerning the chal- lenge of organizing meaning in the places where people live, through the use of the elements of structure. I realized, after repeatedly and intensively studying Shinohara's works over a long period of time, that the extremely abstract relation of opposition recurs in many dif- ferent forms of expression. This relation is more than just one component in Shinohara's method of composition: it is the symbolic key to the interpretation of unconscious meaning. In his method, form is itself both abstract and lucid; it is not analogous to any phenomenal entity. But in this intrinsic structure of his works we can intuit the presence of metaphors deeply rooted in culture and its collective unconsciousness. With this invariant rela- tion of opposition as a base, Shinohara's work has evolved through a great range of compositional variation. His creative activity developed gradually in strength, manifesting itself only through non- representational pure form, without any reference to architectural historicism. For this we can call Shinohara an essentialist, someone dedicated to looking for the true nature of things. In Shinohara's explora- tion-the search for an architectural proto- type through which, using contemporary technique, to produce meaning in the places for contemporary people to live- Shinohara is increasingly feeling the spirit of 1920s modernism. Kazuo Shinohara has introduced a unique approach to ar- chitecture, aiming toward the rehabilita- tion of meaning in his contemporary era. Translated by Neil Warren and Jorge M.E.
