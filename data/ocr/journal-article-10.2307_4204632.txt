<plain_text><page sequence="1">Voprosy moldavskogo yazykoznaniya. (Problems of Moldavian Philology.) Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR, Moscow, 1953. 220 pages. The sole interest of this collective volume of philological articles, all but one of them related to the study of the Rumanian language, resides in the fact that it reveals the effect of Stalin's philological pronunciamiento of 1950 on research in an obscure part of the world dominated by the Soviets. It is a piece of Stalinist philology applied to political realities. The eastern part of Rumania was organised after the second world war as the Moldavian Republic, with its capital at Chisinau (Kishinyov), which was endowed with a university and an Institute for History, Literature and Language, or local branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The volume under review, produced by collaboration between the Academy Institute of Linguistics and its Moldavian branch, aims at liberating the few young philologists of that centre from the grotesque influence of Marrism which dominated Russian philology for over twenty years. The choice of Chisinau as the scene of the 'show-down' was obvious enough, because Rumanian, as the only Romance language of the Soviet Empire, had served as a 'guinea-pig' to Marr's disciples.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 253 Before 1950 Russian philologists had declared Rumanian to be a cross between the language of the Roman colonists in Dacia and the Slavonic of the invaders. When Marrism was exploded by Stalin, philologists were so taken aback that one of the older Rumanian scholars asked for time to recover from the blinding light of the great master's revelation, which had overcome their ignorance. Then followed the successive acts of a philological tragicomedy. On 21 August 1950 the Institute of Chisinau declared that Rumanian was a Slavonic language; on 19 September 1950 the selfsame Institute denied its Slavonic origin, but warned that it was dangerous to speak of the Romance origin of Rumanian, here called Moldavian. On 3 Novem? ber 1950 Rumanian was proclaimed half-Slavonic and half-Romance; on 15-16 December 1950 its Romance origin was admitted, but its Slavonic origin was not entirely given up (p. 58). To put an end to this painful struggle, the leading philologists of the Soviet Academy undertook to clear the path for their 'Moldavian' juniors and to protect them from the danger of heresy. The dogma enunciated in the articles of this volume could be summed up in the following points: (1) condemnation of Marr by criticism and auto-criticism; (2) reinstatement of the comparative-historical method (with the result that not only the ideas of the 'bourgeois' philologists are adopted but their names fill the bibliography and footnotes); (3) admission that Rumanian is a pure Romance language and shows no Slavonic in? fluences in its structure; (4) recognition of three East Romance languages (not merely one as in the time of 'bourgeois' capitalism), namely Mold? avian, Rumanian and Arumanian (incidentally, some authors who have contributed to the volume add a fourth, viz. Megleno-Rumanian, and those who misread 'bourgeois' studies add a fifth, viz. Macedo-Rumanian, not understanding that this is another term for Arumanian); (5) confirmation of the existence of a Moldavian language (from the 14th century on, or from the October Revolution), which demands the replacement of Rumanian with Russian or dialectal words and uses the Cyrillic alphabet to obscure identity (e.g.frate is Rumanian, and (J)paTe is Moldavian); and (6) correlation of philological research with party policy and ideological propaganda. The general introduction to the symposium is written by V. V. Vino? gradov. It has no direct relation to the special theme and presents the principles of linguistic method, illustrating them with examples from Ossetic, Armenian, and Bashkir (pp. 5-33). B. A. Serebrennikov ('Problems of Comparative-Historical Linguistics and Problems of Moldavian Philology', pp. 34-53) states the principles of comparative-historical philology and their application to the study of Rumanian. He defends the 'Ursprache' concept, but replaces the term prayazyk (protoglossa), because of its Biblical flavour, by yazyk-osnova (basic language). The study of Rumanian, he states, is possible only by the comparative-historical method; Latin and dialectology are indispensable (P- 5?)- Serebrennikov considers that Marr's antihistoricity could be destroyed by the study of Rumanian, and to prove this he pursues the I</page><page sequence="3">254 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW history of certain Rumanian words through Lithuanian and Sanskrit to Indo-European. The principle is correct, but its illustration is on the level of a century ago. The author has a vague conception of Rumanian dialectology. He enumerates the Rumanian dialects as Daco-Rumanian, Macedo-Rumanian, Arumanian, Istro-Rumanian, Megleno-Rumanian. To increase the confusion, he numbers Arumanian among the Daco- Rumanian dialects, identifying this term with 'Urrumanisch' (p. 44). Perhaps through an error of compilation, Serebrennikov creates a form of the ist sing. pres. domn from a domni 'to rule', and explains that this 0 did not diphthongise into oa (as in doamnd), because it had changed into u. Such errors of fact and misstatements, disregarding the elementary rules of descriptive and historical linguistics, are too numerous in this volume to be enumerated here. The next article, by D. E. Mihal'chi ('Aims of Moldavian Linguistics', pp. 54-72), is a report on what has been done and what should be done in 'Moldavian' philology; it was presented to the Institute of Chisinau in 1952. Among desiderata in the programme for the future there is mention of a linguistic atlas, but not of the fact that the material for the atlas was collected between the two wars under the direction of Sextil Puscariu and that one of the field-workers is publishing the maps in Bucharest and cutting out the points in Bessarabia. There would be no difficulty in asking the members of the Rumanian Academy in Bucharest to pass over the collected material to the Institute in Chisinau, which could publish it as an achievement for the benefit of philological research. This would not contradict Stalin's doctrine, from which we learn that the same language which served a capitalist regime may also serve a com? munist regime. Emphasis is laid in this article on the existence of two Rumanian languages?Rumanian and Moldavian. B. V. Shishmaryov ('The Romance Languages of south-Eastern Europe and the National Language of the Moldavian S.S. Republic', pp. 73-121) states that there are four East Romance languages?Moldavian, Ruman? ian, Arumanian and Megleno-Rumanian. This article is a history of Rumanian philology in relation to the formation of the Rumanian people and its early history. The opinions of Rumanian and foreign scholars are reproduced objectively, not always with accuracy, and without criticism. Linguistic and ethnical facts are confused for political purposes, e.g. on p. 75 the presence of two Slavonic words for snow (omdt, zdpadd) alongside one Romance word is explained by the preponderance of the Slavs in the respective regions. Geographical areas as well as semantics are entirely disregarded; moreover linguistic facts are explained by ethnographic elements. A linguistic explanation of the two Slavonic loan-words in Rumanian has been given lately by B. O. Unbegaun ('Les norn de la neige en roumain' in Orbis, II, 2, 1953), and his study illustrates the way in which the comparative method is applied in linguistics. The same ethnic thesis is supported by the word nevastd 'young wife', a dialect word which in the author's view represents a Slav woman absorbed into the Rumanian social system and thus proves the mixed racial character of the Rumanian people. This confusion of linguistic and ethnographic facts is</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 255 not new, but philology long ago abandoned the anthropomorphic inter? pretation of linguistic facts. Should we have to infer that the regions which do not know that term are purely Romance? Then, it would perhaps be to the point to mention the fact that there are at least three other terms of Romance origin to designate the same idea. There exist in England to this day several gypsy families whose colloquial language is Rumanian. They have settled round London, coming from America, where they had emigrated from Bosnia. Their ancestors at one time crossed Rumanian territory and acquired the local language, which is preserved in its old form. Asking one of the gypsies where his wife was, I went through the three terms which occurred to me at the moment (sofie, femeie, nevastd) without obtaining a satisfactory reply. Only after a patient explanation I found that the word for wife was for them muiere. Does that make them more a Romance people? Discussing theories on the homeland of the Rumanians, Shishmaryov adheres to that formulated by Al. Philippide (Originea Romdnilor, I-II, 1923-7), according to which the homeland was south as well as north of the Danube. The Romance element has continued its existence in reduced numbers in the Carpathians, where it was reinforced by southern ele? ments, displaced by the settlement of the Slavs in the Balkans in the 6th~7th centuries (pp. 95 sq.). However, Shishmaryov eliminates the Rumanians from the region between the Carpathians and the Danube in the 10th century on the ground that the name of the South Rumanians (Wallachians) is Mun teni (mountaineers) and that they therefore occu? pied the mountains, while the plain was inhabited by the Cumans (Polovecians) and the Pechenegs. The presence of these nomad peoples is historically recorded in the plain of Wallachia, but on toponymic grounds the Rumanians cannot be eliminated from this region, because in it are situated the county called Vlasca and the forest Vldsia, which had a greater extension than today. This name (Vlah) was given by the South Slavs to their neighbours, the Rumanians, between the Danube and the Car? pathians from the 7th century onwards. The aim of Shishmaryov's argument is to show that 'Moldavian' is genetically different from 'Rumanian', viz. that it represents an eastern wave which spread from south to north. The theory of two imaginary waves is taken from Philippide, but the same Rumanian philologist has shown with the aid of linguistic arguments that the Rumanian of Mol? davia and that of Transylvania belong to the same dialect. Shishmaryov disregards the linguistic arguments, because they contradict his pre? conceived theory (p. 67). The dialectal difference between Moldavia and Wallachia is much smaller than that between North Russian and South Russian, and from the literary point of view the development of all the Rumanian provinces was the same. The conception of Rumanian as a mixed Romance-Slavonic language is repeatedly condemned (pp. 84, 100, etc.), and the absurdity of this theory is illustrated also by the structure of English, which has not become a mixed language because of its Latin elements which represent a much higher percentage than that of Slavonic in Rumanian.</page><page sequence="5">256 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW The author is haunted by the idea of substratum and bilingualism, by which he tries to prove the superposition of ethnic strata. Nobody denies the ethnic mixture of Slavs and Rumanians, but this cannot be ascer? tained by linguistics. On p. 104 we are told that in northern Bukovina (annexed by the Soviet in 1946) the Rumanian element was super? imposed on an East Slavonic substratum, and an attempt is made to sup? port this theory with the argument that place-names like Slatina, Straja (in South Slavonic form), appear in this region alongside Storojinet, Storoja, Solotina (in East Slavonic forms). The last two do not exist. The point made by the author is that the former were brought by the Ruman? ians from Transylvania and imposed on the latter, which represent the East Slavonic substratum. In face of the fact that the immigration of the East Slavonic element into this region is historically recorded, it would be easier to support an interpretation of the facts the other way round. The words straja, slatina, like balta, bdlti, are common Rumanian words (of Slavonic origin) and were used as place-names all over the territory inhabited by Rumanians, even east of the Dniester river (Balta). The East Slavonic forms are of literary origin as is shown by their hybrid formation: a Slavonic ending is attached to a Rumanian stem (e.g. Frdtduti, Pdtrduti, Broscduti, with the suffix -ovce), or they represent trans? lations of older forms. This does not exclude the existence of East Slavonic forms of a later date. The history of place-names is being too much abused for racial ends. We reviewed in this periodical (cf. Slavonic and East European Review, April 1948) a study on the place-names of Bessarabia (1946) by M .V. Sergiyevky with the express purpose of illustrating the colonisation of this territory. Such studies, for whatever purpose they are made, would be gratifying if their authors did not distort facts and respected the elementary principles of linguistics. Shishmaryov accepts Sergiyevsky's view of the identity of the literary languages of Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania, propounded by Sergiyevsky in a study published in 1928 ('K istorii sozdaniya literaturnogo yazyka v Rumynii', Uchonyye zapiski MIFLI, III), but only for the present time. He demands that in future the Western influences of the past should be replaced by Russian elements, 'because of the leading political and cultural role and the colossal importance of the Russian language, not only in the life of the languages of the peoples of the Soviet Union but also in the life of the languages of the democratic peoples and even of capitalist countries' (p. 119). This approach to the literary language of a culture is similar to the old conception of normative grammar which was supposed to teach people how to speak. R. A. Budagov's article ('The Moldavian Language and the Other Romance Languages', pp. 121-34) retracts his previous assertion that Rumanian is a Balkan language and recognises its Romance character (p. 132), but he emphasises the existence of two Rumanian languages. According to him the relationship between Moldavian and Rumanian is similar to that between French and Provencal, or Spanish and Portuguese. When he attempts to support his view, he is able to quote fifteen regional words compiled for him by two specialists in Rumanian philology?</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 257 Sergiyevsky and I. Iordan. He presents as different words the same word written in Cyrillic and in Latin characters. Budagov states that the two Rumanian languages were differentiated by the October Revolution (p. 133), after which Moldavian (he has in mind Rumanian east of the river Dniester) has been changed into another language by Russian influence, which introduced into the language new lexical elements like chino, club, policlinica, raion, colhoz, stahanovef, etc. Even less critical judgment is shown in R. G. Piotrovsky's article ('Slavo- Moldavian Relationship', pp. 135-49): it is compiled from secondary sources, disregarding important works for the study of the problem, like Densusianu's Histoire de la langue roumaine or the dictionaries of Tiktin, Berneker, and Miklosich. Nor are the facts always correct, e.g. in the word oghial 'quilt, eiderdown' (dial.) the letter i does not represent a vowel, but shows only the softness of the velar. The author transcribes the word ornnji and bases his explanation on the vowel i (p. 141). The principle repeated by each contributor of this volume is also emphasised by the student of the Slavonic element, which has not altered the Romance structure of the 'East Romance languages' (p. 140). The Slavonic element in Rumanian is divided into two periods. The first period covers the Slavo-Rumanian symbiosis of the 9th to the 14th cen? turies. The political expression of this symbiosis is the two Vlaho-Bulgarian empires (regna Bulgarorum et Vlacorum). In this period Rumanian was penetrated by South Slavonic elements (p. 136). The second period, from the 14th century onwards, shows East Slavonic influences. The result 01 these influences was the Moldavian language, which is an independent language (p. 140). This schematic division is far from satisfactory to the student of the complex problem of the Slavonic element in Rumanian. The East Slavonic element is of late date, regional, and limited in number. For the study of South Slavonic influence the dialects, the chronological moment, the manner of penetration (literary or direct) all complicate the study of each element. Thus on p. 138 the words gdnscd, gdscd, gdnsac are discussed without paying attention to the presence or absence of the nasal. (Moreover two mistakes appear in the forms of these words as given by the author, viz. he creates a masc, gdsac, which does not exist in the language, and spells them with a (Cyrillic d) instead of a (Cyrillic bi). The literary form, without the nasal, is a new form, borrowed from Bulgarian after the nasal vowels had lapsed in that language. It spread through literature to most regions of Rumanian speech, but it is not general. The forms with the nasal (gdnscd, gdnsac) represent the old loans of the type mdndru, ddmb, etc. These are doublets of the type of French chetif captif *(&lt;Lat. captivum). Curiously enough, Piotrovsky illustrates the doublets in Rumanian by Rum. vested 'withered' (&lt;Lat. vescidum) and plenic (&lt;O.B. plenniku (sic), a word which does not exist in Rumanian), or with lucru, pricind, which do not correspond to the type; and Slavonic vreme has not eliminated Latin timp, as we are told (p. 140). Inconsistencies and contradictions among the authors of this volume are not exceptional. We are told by Piotrovsky that Bessarabia was an? nexed by Russia in 1812 in order 'to save the Moldavian language from</page><page sequence="7">258 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW being swallowed up by the Rumanian language' (p. 143). However, Shishmaryov speaks of Bessarabia's russification under the tsars, and of the complete proscription of Rumanian in church and school in Bessarabia (p. 114). A further narrowing of the subject of this volume is S. B. Bernshteyn's article 'The Slavonic Element in the Moldavian Language' (pp. 150-8), which incidentally explains the genesis of this volume. Marr's school had chosen Rumanian to illustrate the stadialist theory, so the heresy had to be destroyed on its own ground. Bernshteyn roundly condemns the Rumanian philologists who had accepted Marrism and had denied the Romance character of Rumanian. However, entering the history of the language he finds that the region between the Carpathians and the Dniester be? tween the- 6th and 15th centuries was part of the Kiev state and of the Principalities of Galicia and Volynia. This theory has only one defect, viz. that in the first part of that period these states did not exist, and for the time when they existed the documents do not show that their suzerainty extended over that territory. The article is otherwise a repetition of ideas already expressed in previous studies in this volume: Bernshteyn defends with keenness the new discovery of the 'Latinity' of the Rumanian lan? guage and believes in the ethnic role of the Slavonic elements in Rumanian, though he condemns the father of this conception, the Bulgarian scholar Tsonev. The last three articles are written by local 'Moldavian' philologists, who are trying to apply the methods of their old 'bourgeois' masters to special problems of the history of the language and to conform at the same time to the dogma expounded in the previous articles of the regenerated masters of Soviet philology (cf. E. D. Cioban, 'The Present State of Scientific Research into the Moldavian Language and its History', pp. 159-82; N. G. Corlateanu, 'The Problem of the Basic Vocabulary of the Moldavian Language', pp. 183-206; I. C. Varticean, 'Some Principles of the Development of the Grammatical System of the Mol? davian Language', pp. 207-19). The interest of these articles consists in the enumeration of bibliographical studies published in those 'remote lands', in which philology has become a magic doctrine of politics. We find out from these articles that in the 'new Moldavian' language the vocabulary has been enriched by words of the following kind: acrariu 'oxygen' from Rumanian acm 'sour', apariu 'hydrogen' from apa 'water'. By this means the difference between 'Moldavian' and Rumanian has been demonstrated. Another way of differentiating the two languages is by Russian caiques: carmozavodnicd 'factory committee', dreptumalurijiinic 'of the right bank of the river', capotuntiope 'stupidity' after the Russian rojiOBOTHiicTBO, etc. (p. 161). Such compound words are impossible in Rumanian, and any 'Moldavian' would understand the corresponding English words more easily than the 'Moldavian' expressions. We are further told that the Moldavian language has been soiled in the past by 'occidental barbarisms', and an appeal is made to replace these Rumanian barbarisms with cultural words, e.g. $omaj by bezrabotnitd, definite by opredelenie, ce lula by cletcd, premisd by predpo sated, etc., because</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 259 Russian is 'the most progressive language in the world' (pp. 178, 179). And these methods of purification apply to all languages in the Soviet Union. London G. Nandris</page></plain_text>
