<plain_text><page sequence="1">PMLA Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone M. ALLEWAERT M. ALLEWAERT is an assistant professor of English at Emory University. She is writing a book in which she proposes that an eco logical interpretation of plantation spaces changes how eighteenth-century scholars conceive agency, politics, and genre. IN THE DESCRIPTION OF GEORGIA'S SEA ISLANDS THAT OPENS PART 2 OF his Travels (1791), William Bartram imagines that the marshlands that connect the mainland to these islands are part of a swampy archipelago that extends from Virginia to Mississippi to Vera Cruz. This vision of geographic continuity either anticipates manifest destiny or, on the contrary, presages the dissolution of the North American continent: "Whether this chain of sea-coast-islands is a step, or advance, which this part of our continent is now making on the Atlantic ocean," Bartram muses, "we must leave to future ages to determine." The advancing continent seems initially to confirm a present-day scholarly tendency to read the writings of eighteenth century Anglo-European elites as contributing to the imperialistic project of continental expansion. But as Bartram moves deeper into his meditation, the continent begins to dissolve. He reminds the reader that the tide-filled marshes that join the continent to the is lands "were formerly high swamps of firm land," and any southern planter could confirm that draining these coastal marshes would yield "strata of Cypress stumps and other trees" (78). Land becomes sea, and only fossils and fragments remain to testify to these marshes' terrestrial past as the southern terrain that Bartram exhaustively de tails in more than four hundred pages moves toward annihilation. My suggestion that Bartram's Travels is a watery meditation that threatens to dissolve into its own apocalyptic undertow departs from critical assessments that focus on the material history of the places through which Bartram moved (Cashin; Waselkov and Braund) or on his contribution to the ultimately imperialistic project of revolutionary 340 2008 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</page><page sequence="2">12 3-2 M. Allewaert 341 nationalism, which required forgetting, or at least managing, Indian pasts (Sayre) and mak ing nature into a well-regulated space ensur ing the good order of the nation-state (Looby; Hallock). My reading of Travels resists the as sumption that colonial and later national ven tures were largely uncontested and hegemonic. With its watery future, the continent typifies the volatile tropical spaces that Bartram char acteristically interprets cataclysmically.1 In the southern lowlands, the "ruins of costly build ings and highways... overgrown with forests" and "habitations... mouldering to earth" (97) complement "heaps of white, gnawed bones of the ancient bufFaloe, elk and deer, indiscrimi nately mixed with those of men, half grown over with moss" (265). As these passages indi cate, his account of the tropics shows that the supposedly uncultivated bears traces of hu man history and politics even as the regions forests, vines, mosses, and sinks obscure this human history. Yet if Bartrams tropics always have a history, they also reveal the impossibil ity of separating human agents and histories from a liquefying natural world. Although Bartram focuses on dissolu tions, I believe that we need not read Travels abyssally, since it also yields an ecological conception of revolution that alters theoriza tions of resistance in the eighteenth-century plantation zone. I use the term plantation zone to designate a space that is tropical (or subtropical) and whose economy and politi cal structures are shaped by the plantation form.2 The entanglements that proliferated in the plantation zone disabled taxonomies dis tinguishing the human from the animal from the vegetable from the atmospheric, revealing an assemblage of interpenetrating forces that I call an ecology.3 This ecological orientation departs from an eighteenth-century political and aesthetic tradition distinguishing per sons?in particular, white colonial subjects? from the objects and terrains they surveyed. In fact, Bartram s increasingly ecological ori entation compromised his ability to function as a citizen-subject of print culture. Focusing on Anglo-European travelers and on African resistance, I argue that instead of simply pro ducing subjects who gained power through an abstract and abstracting print culture, the plantation zone witnessed the emergence of agents who gained power by combining with ecological forces.4 This shift from subjectivity to agency testifies to an organization of politi cal life that is not dependent on the separation of subjects from an object world. This is not to say that human agents in the plantation zone enjoyed an idyllic intersubjectivity with ani mals, plants, and objects. Rather, the point is that at precisely the moment citizen-subjects were emerging in metropolitan centers, the plantation zone gave rise to an ecological practice closely linked to marronage, a pro cess through which human agents found ways to interact with nonhuman forces and in so doing resisted the order of the plantation. In Travels, Bartram intended not to chronicle the complex political history of the American tropics, to elegize loss, or to lose (or find) him self but to distinguish southern North Amer ica as a temperate region that contributed to the healthy "activity of the human faculties" (14). This project required a methodological commitment to framing the lowlands through the terminology used in eighteenth-century temperate regions. Accordingly, he records the terrain through which he passes in the nomenclature of Linnaean botany, always pausing to give a plant or animal a properly Latinate name, often spinning multiple-page lists of species that he finds in tropical hol lows. Yet in spite of his effort to describe the southern lowlands as a temperate space, the tropical, the useless, and the cataclysmic con tinually set him off course. He consistently describes this south ern geography in terms that emphasize its tropical splendor. This tropicalization is</page><page sequence="3">342 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone PMLA underscored by the concatenation of Virginia, Mississippi, and Vera Cruz; by his attention to the region's connections to unambigu ously tropical places, including Cuba and the West Indies; and by his recurrent complaints about the region's humidity. It is not enough to designate the terrains that fascinated him with the adjective tropical Rather, Virginia, Mississippi, and Vera Cruz had all been colo nies where heat-dependent crops?indigo, to bacco, sugar, coffee, rice?were produced on lowland plantations fueled by slave labor. In short, the terrain depicted by Travels was an assemblage of interpenetrating forces that was regional (tropical) and linked to a particular economic and political configuration (the plantation). In the plantation zone, animals, persons, plants, artifacts and their histories, and even land were penetrating, fusing with, transforming one another. The regions heat driven processes contributed to the growth of cash crops that sustained m?tropoles. But the proliferation of colonial regimes as well as of the region's lush vegetation slowed down, encroached on, and transformed all human agents in this ecology. Many colonials disap peared into the tropics; Bartram himself all but vanished during the five-year botanical journey that served as the basis of Travels. Sometimes Bartram experienced his en tanglement in the lowlands as a pleasurable loss of self. To the dismay of his successful fa ther, the royal botanist John Bartram, William failed in every venture to which he turned his hand. This aptitude for failure might well have given him the impetus to disappear into tropical frontiers. It might also have been what made him so profoundly uncomfort able in eighteenth-century Philadelphia that he refused every invitation that would have brought him into the public. Although in vited to work in one of Benjamin Franklin's print shops, he declined. Although elected a member of the prestigious American Philo sophical Society, he apparently never attended a single meeting. Although included on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, he never taught a class. The significant point here is that Bartram's fascination with the tropics pulled him outside the emergent American public sphere. Eventually he did publish his Travels, but it was a slow production, and he had a tortured relation to his printed book. In Letters of the Republic, Michael Warner proposes that print culture and the resulting public sphere catalyzed the enlightenment revolutions that birthed the citizen-subject of modern nationalism. The subjectivity that developed through print culture required that persons give up private identities for public identity; it also required that they give over their private bodies to a print culture that was intensely material insofar as it proliferated presses, typefaces, and print artifacts and disembodied insofar as it idealized the ab straction of particular personages.5 The aim of representative men like Benjamin Frank lin was to produce themselves as exemplary citizen-subjects who existed primarily in print and in relation to others who also circulated in print. If Franklin is Warner's exemplar of the citizen-subject, Bartram offers a good test case through which we can trace the emergence of a mode of agency that is not equivalent to sub jectivity and that developed outside the metro politan centers associated with print culture. Instead of an inscrutable proto-Bartleby who chooses against choosing in order to register his ambivalence about print and publicity, Bartram was something of a proto-Chandos: a man so entwined with the tropical ecology that the projects of representation, commu nication, and publicity became excruciating.6 His account of swamps and the transforma tion of people who lived in them reveals a mode of action that pulls away from the public sphere and all it represents. Plantation spaces possessed those who traversed them. The heat that changed the orientation and movements of bodies and the diseases that the climate was thought to carry, as well as the bites of the re gion's insects and venomous snakes, all com</page><page sequence="4">123.2 M. Allewaert 343 promised bodily and metaphysical integrity. Bodies so penetrated could not be diffused into singular yet abstract corpuses like that of a republic sustained by print culture; they were pulled instead into the sprawling (and overlapping) biological, economic, and social systems of the plantation zone. There was perhaps no space more para digmatically tropical and more threatening to colonials than the swamps in which Bar tram spent a good part of five years. Although swamps were frequently part of a plantation's grounds and, as he notes, were most often used for rice cultivation, they also compromised the order and productivity of imperial ven tures, from explorations to plantations. Often described as unnavigable terrains?Bartram called them "inextricable" (47)?swamps stymied colonial armies and cartographers. Cabeza de Vaca's early account of the Spanish exploration of Florida emphasizes the "great difficulty and danger" of the wetlands, where Indians kept the Spaniards under continual attack (41; see esp. chs. 6-8). Two centuries later, the members of William Byrd's survey ing team imagine Virginia's Dismal Swamp as an alluring "terra incognita," but this fantasy disappears once they enter the swamp and find themselves lost, sunk, and sick (56-80). Byrd juxtaposes this account of his surveying team with an encounter between himself and a community of mulattoes who claim to be free but whom he suspects are escaped slaves. Significantly, swamps sheltered diasporic Af ricans who, in refusing slave status, repudi ated the prevailing organization of Virginia's plantation economy. If swamps were intrac table for Anglo-Europeans, colonials like Cabeza de Vaca and Byrd regarded them as navigable terrain for Africans and Indians. The swamps that sheltered runaways and Maroons and that were folded with difficulty into colonial and then national taxonomies ranged across the tropics.7 These unmappable and (in the Anglo-European imagination) Af ricanized spaces pulled colonials into a hum of life and decay that compromised efforts to produce state, economic, and scientific order. Swamps also confounded Anglo-European ef forts to mine American landscapes to produce commodities, to further science, and to fulfill conventional aesthetic categories?ranging from the picturesque to the sublime. Instead of making economic, objective, or aesthetic use of swamplands, Anglo-Europeans were repeatedly sucked into their dense networks. When he described lowland plants as "veg etating," Bartram named the process by which a sentient force acts in an ecology that acts on and through it. Many colonial writers, includ ing Bartram's admirer Fran?ois-Ren? de Cha teaubriand, described how people, like plants, entered into vegetative states in the planta tion zone.8 The entanglements occasioned by swamps complicated colonial efforts to make clear distinctions between human beings and the natural world. In the opening pages of Travels, plants manifest agency. Observing a Venus flytrap, Bartram asks, "Can we... hesi tate a moment to confess, that vegetable beings are endued with the same sensible faculties or attributes, similar to those that dignify animal nature; they are organical, living, and self-moving bodies, for we see here ... mo tion and volition" (17). The plants in Erasmus Darwin's The Botanic Garden (1791) had sen sations, but Bartram pushed this idea further, insisting that "vegetable beings" also had "voli tion." While he maintains that animals, unlike plants, "have the powers of sound, and are lo comotive," this distinction weakens in the next paragraph, when he describes plants' power of "transplanting or colonising their tribes al most over the surface of the whole earth" (18). Taxonomizing in the tropics proved impos sible since human beings are revealed to be entwined with vegetable life. In the introduction to Travels, Bartram lavishly describes a spider's killing and eating of its prey and contemplates the growth of a vine (22-23, 17). The cessation of movement and imperviousness to Chronometrie time</page><page sequence="5">344 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone PMLA necessary to making such observations offer some sense of what eighteenth-century colo nial writers meant when they gave the verb vegetating to people. More significant, in the process of making these recordings Bartram's body becomes not simply a corollary for but also a part of the movements of the tropics. Recording the growth of a vine, Bartram slides toward the metaphysical. We see climbers ... invariably leaning, extend ing, and like the fingers of the human hand, reaching to catch hold of what is nearest, just as if they had eyes to see with; and when their hold is fixed, to coil the tendril in a spi ral form, by which artifice it becomes more elastic and effectual than if it had remained in a direct line, for every revolution of the coil adds a portion of strength; and thus col lected, they are enabled to dilate and contract as occasion or necessity requires. (17) This meditation on the vine's capacity to join itself with "what is nearest" might at first seem a simple anthropomorphism: the extensions of vines resemble the extensions of hands, and plants, like hands, seek community. An thropomorphism, however, domesticates the foreign by making it human; Bartram's "as if" suggests a movement that falls short of putting plants and people into correspondence.9 This vine does not work in the way that human be ings do: in fact, it works better. In Travels, Bar tram suggests that human lives are bound up in the lives of plants and, moreover, that those who would survive in the tropics must learn from plants how to move with the southern ecology. The tendril that pulls a person into its spiraling motions joins the human will to that of plants, producing a knowledge that changes human actions. These grasping vines' desire for conjunction and collectivity with other tropical forces depends on the stretching out ward of parts. Their gracefully collectivizing movements result in huge strength: "humor ing the motion[s] of... limbs and twigs," the webby hold of the cirri ensures that they are not "liable to be torn off by sudden blasts of wind or other assaults" (17). No simple para site that lives off another thing that is indepen dent in itself, the vine joins what it encloses in its delicate hold. Agencied appendages mov ing outward, binding and combining?this is what enables life in the tropics. The combinatory power endemic to the tropics also poses hazards. For one, Bartram fears being consumed by the region. The most obvious referent for the fear is tropical dis ease, and he does record a bout with an ill ness that permanently damaged his eyesight. Even more to the point, the combinations of the plantation zone destroyed the integrity of structures, whether of bodies, vines, build ings, or histories. After praising the adaptive capacity of the wild pine, Bartram notes that the region's trees become colonizing powers: "peach trees, figs, pomegranates, and other shrubs, grow out of the ruinous walls of for mer spacious and expensive buildings" (73). The transformative power of the tropics' veg etable life often allows for increased strength, but these transformations profoundly and permanently change human habitations, bod ies, and patterns of thought. Transformed by the tropics' ecology, Bartram was unable to mime the stance of objectivity that structured colonial subjects' scientific practices, and this compromised his ability to produce the useful knowledge that would redeem southern North America as a temperate zone. But if he veered from the project of compiling useful knowledge, his sojourn through the lowlands might still prove of aesthetic use. Given his laborious revisions of the manuscript as well as his turn to the rhetoric associated with the sub lime, he clearly had aesthetic ambitions. The eighteenth-century discourse of the sublime, most famously developed by Edmund Burke's Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful (1757), showed that aesthetics had philosophical sig nificance. In Burke's account, experiencing</page><page sequence="6">123.2 M. Allewaert 345 the sublime required courting the useless, since "[wjhenever strength is only useful... then it is never sublime" (61). But if theories of the sublime argued for the importance of the ostensibly useless, they also hewed closely to the expectation that the perceiving subject would remain distinct from the object world. Burke insists that sublime spectacles should give subjects only the idea of danger, for "when danger... press [es] too nearly," it is "incapable of giving any delight" and is, instead, "simply terrible" (36). In eighteenth-century aesthetic theory, the subject of sublime experience was required to remain distinct from sublime ob jects. Theories of the sublime thus confirmed the basic assumption of Enlightenment natu ralism: that the subject stand apart from the object world that he or she would master.10 If the sublime is a subjective experience evoked by spectacles that seem dangerous in their magnitude or power, swamps are quin tessentially sublime spaces, because they are vast geographies that defy measurement. Yet swamps not only seem dangerous; they are dangerous. Bartram suggests that human be ings in the plantation zone are truly in peril, and here the possibility of the Anglo-European sublime vanishes: white men who move through swamps do not gain ground firm enough to sustain conceptualizations that will confirm that their (subjective) capacities for empiricism, reason, or aesthetic appreciation are greater than the threat of the swamps. In swamps, the subjective and objective converge, making clearly delimited human subjectivity impossible. This impossibility is especially evi dent when, attacked by alligators, mosquitoes, heat, and his own exhaustion, Bartram admits that he is "deprived of every desire but that of ending my troubles as speedily as possible" (126). His inability to produce a subjectivity that bounds sublime scenes is dramatically evident in this moment when he fantasizes ceasing to be, but it is most consistently evi dent in his sentences. Even when he means to evoke order, they are swimming productions that seldom manage to frame a point. His turn to the sublime devolves into an impassioned fusion of human, animal, and vegetable life, and here the aesthetic project of colonialism is as deeply compromised as its scientific one.11 Snakes, diseases, and vines might pen etrate people's bodies, and the lushness of vegetable life might possess their minds. However, the most visceral threat to white colonials in the plantation zone came from the diasporic Africans who were "compelled to labour in the swamps and lowlands" (228). Bartram understood that there was reason to fear the Africans, who were sometimes a majority population in the American tropics. In 1765 he persuaded his father to buy him property in the Florida wetlands and slaves to work this property so that he could start a rice and indigo plantation. Henry Laurens, a family friend, reported that Bartram was the only "human inhabitant within nine miles," by which he meant the only white man, and also suggested that Bartram's miserable fail ure as a planter resulted from his difficulty in managing his slaves, whom Laurens describes as inept and rebellious. Only two of his slaves could "handle an axe," and one of these was "exceedingly insolent," so much so as "to threaten his life" (qtd. in Slaughter 159-60). Although Bartram takes pains to emphasize plantations' idyllic good order, he also notes the brawn of male slaves as well as their skill with "gleaming axes" (94, 259). Swamps threatened colonials' efforts to separate themselves from the natural world, but it was rebellious Africans who most clearly made swamps revolutionary. Toward the conclusion of Travels, the danger posed by Africans in plantation societies comes to the fore. After leaving a South Carolina planta tion, Bartram was riding along sandy ridges, contemplating the cavitation of reefs and land, when he [ojbserved a number of persons coming up a head, whom I soon perceived to be a party of</page><page sequence="7">346 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone P M L A Negroes. I had every reason to dread the con sequence ... [and] had reason to apprehend this to be a predatory band of Negroes_I was unarmed, alone, and my horse tired; thus situated every way in their power, I had no alternative but to be resigned and prepare to meet them. ... I mounted and rode briskly up; and though armed with clubs, axes and hoes, they opened to right and left and let me pass peaceably. Their chief informed me whom they belonged to, and said they were going to man a new quarter at the West end of the bay; I however kept a sharp eye about me, apprehending that this might possibly have been an advanced division, and their intentions were to ambuscade and surround me; but they kept on quietly. (379) Bartram emphasizes that he is powerless? "unarmed, alone" and "resigned," before the "power" of Africans whom he fears might kill him. The power of these Africans comes from their alliance with the land: "axes and hoes" are weapons as much as clubs are. Moreover, the Africans have a chief?a term that Bartram occasionally uses to mean a political leader outside a specifically Indian context and that indicates the autonomy of this band of Afri cans. In the span of a clause the possibility of African marronage disappears, as the chief names himself and his companions as belong ing to a master. Nonetheless, the possibility returns with doubled force when Bartram then imagines that this group is an "advanced division" of a larger army of African militants who mean to "ambuscade" him. In this passage, Bartram wavers, uncer tain whether to cast the Africans as slaves or Maroons. These two sorts of diasporic Afri can identity were markedly different: slaves had a relation to a master, for whom they were required to labor; Maroons refused this relation and vanished into the swamps or mountains, sometimes forming large and still-extant communities.12 While eighteenth century Anglo-Europeans typically imagined that slaves were submissive, they saw Maroons as militant. The distinction between the states of slavery and marronage shrinks in this pas sage. First, Bartram's oscillating description of these Africans as slaves or Maroons sug gests that he thinks all slaves may refuse the weight of mastery. Second, Bartram expects that both slaves and Maroons have a particu larly proximate relation to tropical terrains, and he also expects that this proximity has military significance. After this episode, Bartram vanishes Af ricans into the tropics' background. But the African agency that surfaces and then disap pears from Travels does not remain sublated. Sometime after completing Travels, Bartram wrote an antislavery tract on the back of one of his father's plant catalogs (figs. 1 and 2). In this never published polemic, he states that only total abolition can stop a cataclysm in which the Africans "will be masters and ... enslave or exterminate their masters and op pressors."13 Africans, he supposes, can pro duce an annihilation more immediate than the slow destruction of swamp and ocean. His argument in favor of abolition indicates that he imagines Maroons as potent revolutionar ies. If Travels testifies to an ecological cycle that consumes the history and subjectivity of white men, this unpublished tract suggests that Africans will somehow be able to use this ecology to destroy plantation societies unless state powers act first and abolish slavery. In calling for a political and juridical solution (the abolition of slavery), Bartram comes close to taking on the mantle of citizen subject. However, instead of presenting the tract to the public, he hid it among his father's effects. The artifact is emblematic of the dis appearance of Bartram as a subject: it is writ ten on the reverse of a catalog that testifies to his father's legacy.14 Bartram's marks show through on the pages of his father's catalog, but his resistance, as well as the African resistance Bartram takes as his subject, is contained by his father's colonial taxonomies. In a letter to a South Carolina friend, he requests that his</page><page sequence="8">12 3.2 M. Allewaert 347 Fig. 1 Antislavery tract by William Bartram.

Allewaert 349 regards be conveyed to the "Black People," for "these acknowledgement[s] at least, are due from me to them, although they are Negroes and Slaves" (qtd. in Slaughter 233). No doubt there are many reasons why a white man who owned slaves might imagine himself in debt to black persons. One of Bartram's debts, the one I discuss in the remainder of this essay, is a glimmering awareness that an ecological re lation between persons and place had political purchase. His account of the tropics chronicles the loss of the continent, of human memorials, of the subject, and of the recognizably politi cal. Yet the immersion of persons in place was neither a drowning nor a glimpse of the end of time. Bartram may have gleaned that there was a positive, political content to this rela tion, but he was not able to offer it.15 Nature was often vested with revolutionary significance in the late eighteenth century (see Paulson). The increasingly antirevolution ary Burke describes the French Revolution as an explosion of primal forces that produced too natural people who, like "savages" or "Maroon slaves" (Reflections 188), "rudely" stripped away "[a]ll the decent drapery of life" to reveal a barren terrain (239). Accord ing to Burke, the revolutionary taste for the natural culminated in a horrid literalism that cast persons and landscapes in the harsh light of reason: "In the groves of [the revolutionar ies'] academy, at the end of every visto, you see nothing but the gallows" (240). The prob lem with revolution was not only that it was primitive but also that it produced a new scen ery that could not be safely observed since it could annihilate an observer. To push Burke's point, the practice and rhetoric of revolution breached the distinction between a social realm, which was the province of the human, and a natural realm, which was the province of primal forces, animals, and objects. Revo lution brought about a too close association of the human and the natural, and this associa tion deeply compromised a tradition in which nature was organized as a series of landscapes that were distinct from and valued by human beings. Burke's suggestion that groves became gallows invokes a future without landscape. The pressure revolutionary rhetoric put on the assumption that persons were distinct from nature and its objects was particularly felt in plantation societies, not only because of the pull of vines and swamps but also because of the classification, by race slavery, of certain persons as objects. "Savages," Maroons, and naturalists were all aware of how the distinc tion between persons and objects collapsed in the tropics. This collapse, which Burke feared and Bartram chronicled, contributed to the shift from a landscape perspective to an ecological practice?from nature as an object of appreciation to nature as an assem blage of forces. My belief that the possibility of landscape was weakened in the eighteenth century plantation zone and superseded by an ecological perspective is not common among critics who write on this subject. Edouard Glissant, for one, argues that the landscape writing that flourished in the eighteenth century tropics indicates a "propensity to blot out the shudders of life, that is, the turbulent realities of the Plantation, beneath the con ventional splendor of scenery" (70). White colonialists who attend to landscape, he sug gests, contributed to a deeply obfuscating rep resentational structure that hid the region's perpetual unrest. Glissant is surely right to point out that rhapsodic accounts of tropical landscapes contributed to the production of white colo nial subjectivities, and he is also right to point out that Africans were often elided from or carefully managed in colonial encomiums to landscape. However, Bartram's failure to pro duce himself as a subject separate from the southern lowlands, his failure to prioritize Linnaean taxonomies over other ventures, and his failure to fully dismiss the violence</page><page sequence="11">350 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone PMLA that emerged from swamps require an elabo ration of Glissant 's analysis.16 First, Bartram's failures indicate that Africans and the turbu lence of the plantation zone did sometimes break into Anglo-European representations of tropical scenery and, when they did, con founded efforts to hold apart fantasies of tropical scenery and the realities of entan glement and brutal fragmentation. Second, this break in the landscape tradition reveals a genealogy of diasporic resistance. Glissant proposes that slaves and Maroons did not typically occupy themselves by representing landscape, which is certainly true since most Africans in the diaspora had little if any ac cess to the eighteenth-century print culture that enabled representational projects. Nor did Africans have much incentive to contrib ute to a landscape tradition that covered over the brutality of life on plantations. However, Anglo-European texts like Bar tram's indicate that diasporic Africans were hardly indifferent to tropical ecologies. Draw ing on these texts as evidence is suspect: they are often the same works that attempt to pro duce a tropical splendor that covers over the brutality of plantations. Yet Anglo-Europeans believed that Africans were better able to ma nipulate this ecology than they were. In his torical fact and in these Anglo-Europeans' accounts, the Africans who were brutally and problematically allied with plantation terrains used the knowledge they gained from this ecol ogy in pragmatic and literal ways. Plantations did not offer an abstract nature that could be made into symbols for revolution; rather, their ecology contributed to revolution. Those who lived in the colonies?white Creoles, slaves, Maroons, Indians?all realized that knowledge of ecology not only was neces sary for survival but also had military signifi cance. Emilia Viotti da Costa writes, "Long before the Americans and French had risen in the name of freedom, slaves had struggled for their freedom in the colonies of the New World" (118). Viotti da Costas suggestion that African struggles for freedom inspired Anglo European revolutions is no doubt accurate. But Africans fighting for freedom provided more than ideological currency for eighteenth century revolutionaries. They were a military precedent, aphorized centuries later by Che Guevera's dictum that revolutionary action requires "a perfect knowledge of the ground" (16). To be sure, Anglo-European writers' as sociation of African rebellion with the tropi cal ecology often cast Africans as primitives in an effort to minimize the military acumen of slaves and Maroons. For instance, histori ans have sometimes suggested that the slave and mulatto victory in Saint-Domingue can be attributed to Africans' greater immunity to yellow fever, thus implying that they were simply vectors for a disease that acted through them and were not themselves agents in the devastation of France's colonial empire.17 Despite such efforts to minimize the significance of Africans' knowledge of the ground, white Creoles were well aware that slaves and Maroons used the ecology of the tropics to their advantage in the perpetual warfare that developed from race slavery. In 1769 Edward Bancroft wrote a natural history of Guiana in which he noted that the cassava root produces a "speedy and fatal poison" that "[b]y the inattention of the Slaves" was "fre quently drank by the sheep, hogs, and poul try, on the Plantations" (40-41). Although he dismisses this destruction as the result of simple inattention, Bancroft also notes slaves' uses of plants and understands that this bo tanical knowledge was applied to sabotaging the order of colonial plantations: for instance, "the female Slaves who intend to procure abortion" used the orco plant to "lubricat[e] the uterine passages" (52-53). While travel writers, slaves, and Maroons paid attention to the utility of tropical veg etation, they also recognized that the tropics were more than a collection of inert things to be ground into poisons or otherwise in strumentalized. As Bartram's meditation on</page><page sequence="12">123.2 M. Allewaert 351 vines makes clear, the tropical ecology was an animate force whose combinatory power could provide strength (and was imagined to do just that for African agents) but could also consume (and was imagined to do just that to Anglo-European agents). In Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Ne groes of Surinam (1796), John Stedman claims that the "trembling" surface of lowland swamps frequently gave way to "Chasm [s]" in which a man "must in[e]vitably perish, if not extricated by immediate help" (396). These precarious surfaces required that troops walk with great care and in single file. And while Bartram may have been able to make his way through lowland swamps, Stedman repeat edly notes such passage was decidedly disad vantageous for a large colonial army. He also believes that African militants understood how tropical forces could be synthesized with human movements. For instance, he praises Surinamese Maroons' tactic of embedding infrastructures in swampy terrain that Eu ropean troops considered an unnavigable morass (85). Knowing that in some places swamps had firm bottoms, Maroons placed felled logs underwater, to mark paths that could be traversed swiftly. Wim Hoogber gen writes that after struggling to find a way through Surinam's swamps, Colonel Louis Henri Fourgeoud found a "floating bridge of tree trunks hidden between the bushes." Fourgeoud decided that this passageway was "so narrow that they could not possibly use it," for it would require that his troops pass slowly and in single file, thus making them vulnerable because "the path was constantly kept under fire by the Maroons" (96). The plantation zone's animate vegetation and shifting ground were by necessity home and battlefield for its stateless agents and fa cilitated guerrilla operations against colonial powers. The belief that Africans and Indi ans were particularly able to manipulate the zone registers in the engraving March throy a Swamp or Marsh in Terra-Firma, which Wil liam Blake produced in the early 1790s as an illustration for Stedman's Narrative (fig. 3). In the engraving's right foreground, a cypress tree's limbs rise into looping vines, them selves draped with Spanish moss; in the left foreground, a naked black ranger chest-deep in a swamp leads white troops forward. But the soldiers do not look to their guide. Arms akimbo, eyes moving in every direction, they hold their guns above their heads?a posi tioning that creates a series of strong diago nal lines that stand out sharply against the softer diagonal lines of the rain in the back ground. A white figure in front points outside the frame of the engraving. Directionless, the soldiers' confused movements are dis cordant with those of the rain, the trees, and their fellows. But the suggestion that Anglo Europeans are disaggregated by the planta tion zone is only part of the story offered by Blake's engraving. In the far left of the back ground's driving rain, African Maroons align their bodies with the delicate curves of palm trees, from which they attack these troops. One Maroon unloads a fusillade that falls in the same lines as the rain. Toward the back of the middle ground, white troops point their guns skyward to stop this attack, but they aim away from the Maroons above them, failing to find targets. The same swampy terrain that enmires Blake's white troops accommodates his African figures, one of whom walks im perviously through the quagmire, cargo bal anced on head. Africans are represented as having a special relation to and knowledge of the tropics, and Maroon warfare is rep resented as an extension of this ecology: the sway of a tree fulfills the sway of a body, and a shower of rain yields a shower of bullets. Blake's engraving crystallizes the colonial fear that detached subjectivity was impossible in plantation spaces, where white men struggled against an ecology that was often militarized. Blake's attention to the deftness with which Africans navigated the plantation zone underscores a point that Stedman and Bartram</page><page sequence="13">352 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone PMLA 2sM</page><page sequence="14">123.2 M. Allewaert 353 also understood: Anglo-European colonists, unfamiliar with this ecology, were at a signifi cant disadvantage against the Africans, Indi ans, and poor whites who were forced to labor there and who used the knowledge and skills they had gained from this labor to disrupt the order of the plantation. The relation of persons to place in the tropics was not inherently ra cial. Diasporic Africans, Indians, poor whites, and colonial naturalists all found ways of working with this ecology and not in simple opposition to it. Given these agents' disparate but sometimes overlapping goals, a variety of revolutionary practices could emerge from the zone. But although the relation of persons to place was not necessarily racial, eighteenth century Anglo-Europeans generally did see it as shaped by a racial logic: it was Africans who knew that swamps could be made into motile, invisible infrastructures, who knew which plants offered up poisons and which offered food, and who knew the hollows and dark spots that provided shelter and concealment. Representations that bound Africans to swamps worked to delegitimize ecological knowledge by making it into a sign of primi tivism. These representations of Africans also reveal the persistent belief that the relation of persons to place differed in the plantation zone from what it was in Britain, on the Conti nent, and in the northern American colonies. Attending to Anglo-Europeans' representa tions of Africans in the southern lowlands is precisely what enables us to trace a shift from a landscape-focused concept of nature to an ecological one.18 If American plantations evinced a mode of being in which bodies were fragmented and human consciousness was en meshed with plants, histories, economies, and mythologies, it was diasporic Africans who were associated with this mode. These repre sentations make clear that Anglo-Europeans viewed Africans as revolutionary agents de spite and because of their fragmentation by the brutalities of the diaspora. In Anglo-European travelers' accounts, the strength that Afri cans gained from their ability to move with ecology was not simply a biological fact or a Faulknerian testimony to endurance. Rather, the portents of annihilation that break open Bartram's meditations on landscape and the murderous intent that amasses in the back ground of Blake's engraving reveal the aware ness that those who could manipulate ecology possessed a transformative power associated then and now with revolution. As my turn to revolution suggests, the relation of persons to place bears on con ceptualizations of political resistance in eighteenth-century plantation societies. Re cent accounts of revolution in the tropics, in cluding Michel-Rolph Trouill?t's Silencing the Past (1995), Susan Buck-Morss's "Hegel and Haiti" (2000), and Sibylle Fischer's Modernity Disavowed (2004), devote significant attention to the Haitian Revolution and the moderni ties it produced. All these theorists empha size that the creation of a free black republic dedicated to opposing racism and imperialism radically challenged the political and philo sophical assumptions that grounded contem porary revolutionary states. Conceptualizing ecological resistance makes clear the extent to which resistance in the tropics (not just in Saint-Domingue) challenged the politics and philosophy associated with revolution. To de velop this point, it is worth briefly turning to Buck-Morss, who also proposes that resistance in the tropics allows for a new understanding of revolution. What she gains by her argument, however, is a partially redeemed Western meta physics as well as a revolutionary event purged of the contradictions and false universalisms that plagued the political philosophy of the age of revolution. This gain differs from that of an ecological account, which departs from the dialectic between subject and object that often grounds theorizations of revolution. Buck-Morss criticizes an Enlightenment philosophy that proliferated metaphors of slavery while failing to account for literal, his torical slavery. However, she argues that Hegel Fig. 3 March thro' a Swamp or Marsh in Terra Firma, engraving by William Blake, 1794.</page><page sequence="15">354 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone P M L A was not blind to historical slavery. He was aware of the Haitian Revolution and drew on it when developing his master-slave dialectic. By Buck-Morss's argument, the slaves' self emancipation inspired Hegel's belief that "free dom cannot be granted to slaves from above. The self-liberation of the slave is required through a 'trial by death.'... The goal of this liberation, out of slavery, cannot be subjugation of the master in turn, which would be merely to repeat the master's existential impasse,' but, rather, elimination of the institution of slavery altogether" (849). In Buck-Morss's argument, the tropical rebellion that has been sublated by Western political philosophy points to a way out of the "existential impasse" and toward a democratic community not founded on the struggle between lord and bondsperson. Slaves in the tropics offer the only successful model of revolution, for they show the possibility of a collective that is not founded on vertically or ganized relations and thus make revolutionary liberty into a truly universal value. Although powerfully and admirably re parative, Buck-Morss's reading raises prob lems. First, it puts black actors in the service of what is essentially an Anglo-European metaphysical tradition. Second, it passes over the eighteenth-century revolutionary tradi tion's addiction to hierarchy, an addiction that partly explains the preponderance of meta phors of slavery in the political writings of the time, that motivated Anglo-European scien tific and aesthetic projects, and that plagued eighteenth-century democratic revolutions.19 Third and most significant, Buck-Morss's analysis assumes that the quintessential actor of tropical revolution is a slave become sub ject: "slaves ... achieve self-consciousness by demonstrating that they are not things, not objects, but subjects who transform material nature" (848; emphasis mine). This reading returns us to Warner's print-culture thesis, for here again the end point of eighteenth-century revolution is the production of subjects, and, as Buck-Morss makes clear, the work of sub jects is to transform the object material of nature. To be sure, the production of citizen subjects was a preoccupation in centers of revolution from Cap Fran?ais to Philadelphia to Paris. But, as we have seen, the tropics also yielded a practice that ended the political fan tasy that subjects remained distinct from an object world that was simply acted on. My point is not that Buck-Morss is wrong but that there is more to be gained by an eco logical account of resistance. Glissants theory of relation elaborates on that advantage.20 Writ ten two hundred years after Bartram wrote his Travels, Glissant 's Poetics of Relation (1990) is also a meditation on land's turning to sea. Poet ics opens into the "ochre" terrain of an African continent that yields to the abysses of the dias pora. But if the focus is aqueous, Glissant never entirely yields the terrestrial; he conceives the spaces joined by the African diaspora as a "land-sea" (7). An alluvial trope in which solid ities become fluidities that still maintain a resi due of materiality, the land-sea returns in his concluding chapter, which begins on a beach. The "devastated mangrove" swamps that lie be hind the beach and "tie" it to the island inspire a new vision: the beach is "quivering," in fact "burning," and then gives way to swamp and sea (205). The close of Glissants Poetics recalls Bartram's arrangement of land, swamp, and sea. In both the first is becoming the last. But for Glissant a swamp does not presage apoca lypse; it is an animate force that "resists" and, in doing so, reveals depths that "allow us to take off like marrons" (205, 206). Swamps of fer occasion for twentieth- and twenty-first century marronage that has broad political and philosophical significance. Swamps are "depths [that] navigate a path beneath the sea in the west and the ocean in the east," and this path promises that "though we are separated, each in our own Plantation, the now green balls and chains have rolled beneath from one island to the next, weaving shared rivers that we shall open up when it is our time and where we shall take our boats" (206). Remnants of slavery</page><page sequence="16">123.2 M. Allewaert 355 weave land into rivers but do not bind the trop ics to the slave past, because the future Glissant offers is that of marronage, and Maroons are ecological actors who cannot be bound by the history and artifacts of slavery. So what is gained by moving from the drowned subjectivity of Bartram's swamps to Glissant 's "we," which holds together human beings, terraqueous powers, and artifacts? Most obviously, looking to ecology offers ways to build stories about places and actors that archives documenting the citizen-subjects of print culture cannot. Moreover, conceiving of agency as a collaboration of forces that join with planetary flows contributes to a theory of revolution in which death?of the subject or the moment?need not be understood as the limit of any agent or event. This shift from thinking of the plantation zone as a space of endings allows us to abandon the elegiac ori entation that crippled Bartram, and it avoids the agon of dialectical approaches that tend to reinscribe some center and, in so doing, restage the deprivation of margins where possibility is always attenuated. To be sure, eighteenth-century Anglo-Europeans saw swamps as monstrosities that stalled the subject-making work of the sublime. But the swamping of the sublime gives way to an aes thetics that suffuses persons through places to remake the terrain of the political. Notes I am grateful to the many readers whose suggestions have improved this essay and especially beholden to the audi ence at the 2 March 2007 seminar at the McNeil Center for Early American Studies. Particular thanks go to Lauren Coats, Michael Elliott, Jennifer Heil, J. Jennifer Jones, Jaya Kasibhatla, Priscilla Wald, and Deborah Elise White. 1. I am not the first critic to note the aqueous qual ity of Travels. In his discussion of the manuscript's often competing drafts, Thomas Hallock suggests that the final version "swims within the paradoxes that were defined by the western ordinances" and describes an earlier version as having an "aquatic" "pulse" (158, 155). 2. The term zone designates a political configuration that includes many different state powers but remains re gional. The term resists nationalism since it recognizes that plantation spaces were shaped by multiple colonial states, and it also resists cosmopolitan universalism since it recognizes that regional practices and modes of con nection were transformed as they moved out of the trop ics and into other places. 3. My thinking on ecology draws on the work of Law rence Buell, William Cronon, Bruno Latour, Timothy Morton (Ecology and ch. 4 in Poetics), and Dana Phillips. I did not read Susan Scott Parrish's American Curiosity until after I had completed this article, but her book is deeply relevant to my own work. I particularly like her suggestion that turning to the natural world allows schol ars to conceive black agency outside print culture: it "was the talking woods more than the 'Talking Book' that was the 'ur-trope' of the Anglo-African experience" (260). 4. My account of the relation between subjects and agents develops from Latours Politics of Nature. Latour uses the term actant instead o? agent; I use agent because it strikes me as more legible in contemporary academic discourse. I also draw on Marjorie Levinson's analyses of subjects and objects ("Object-Loss" and "Pre- and Post-dialectical Ma terialisms") as well as on William Cronon's foundational effort to give life to "a cast of nonhuman characters which usually occupy the margins of historical analysis" (xv). 5. My reading of print culture's materialities and im materialities draws on Michael Moon's Disseminating Whitman. 6. Hofmannsthal's fictitious letter (1901) reveals Chan dos as a man whose rapturous experience of the physical world stalls representation, which depends on the subject's separation from the physical world. Chandos's letter is ad dressed to Francis Bacon and, among other things, makes clear that there can be no further letters. Like Chandos, Bartram anticipates that proximity to the natural world presages the dissolution of the subject and of the repre sentational projects associated with subjectivity. In my account of ecological agency, developed in part 3 of this es say, I suggest that this dissolution and attendant weaken ing of representational schematics occasions an alternative mode of action instead of the rhapsodic (but terrifying) cessation of action that Chandos and Bartram anticipate. 7. The difficulty of integrating swamps into national structures is particularly evident in the controversy over Thomas Jefferson's selection of a marshy wilderness (now Washington, DC) as the site for the future United States capital (see Green; Ellis). For George Washington's efforts to cultivate swamps, see Royster. For a broad account of swamps in American culture, see Wilson; Miller. 8. Chateaubriand's Atala (1801) and his lesser-known Les Natchez (1790s; pub. 1826) both draw heavily on Bartram's work. In fact, the Mississippi vista that opens Atala is obvi ously indebted to Bartram's Travels (92-93). Other colonial writers who use the verb vegetate to refer to human beings</page><page sequence="17">356 Swamp Sublime: Ecologies of Resistance in the American Plantation Zone PMLA include the narrator of the anonymous My Odyssey, who in structs French "philanthropists" (abolitionists) to "behold them [Africans] vegetate at your side" (93), and General Desfourneaux, who complains that Saint-Domingue's white Creoles were "vegetating with an insouciance that was as revolting as it was unacceptable" (qtd. in Dubois 150). 9. It is significant that Bartram's juxtaposition of per sons and plants develops through a simile ("as if"). Unlike metaphor, simile places clumsy markers?likes and as ifs? between the things it puts into association, thus marking difference while also calling attention to the negotiation through which associations emerge. Thinking carefully about the figures through which likeness emerges is impor tant to ecological analyses, which need to grapple with the question of how they conceive the relation between things. 10. Bartram almost certainly read Burke's treatise, but he probably did not read Kant's work, which was unavail able in English when Bartram was writing. The subject and the object world became even more rigorously separated in Kant's account of the sublime. Unlike Burke, Kant does not locate the sublime in objects; rather, it is an exercise in reason and so ultimately the province of the subject (83 89). Nonetheless, the reading of the sublime I offer could also be extended to Kant, whose work I have in mind when I speak of Anglo-European aesthetic practices. 11. For more on how the aesthetic project of the sub lime contributed to colonialism, see the account of Burke by Sara Suleri, who proposes that "the operation of the sublime is continually represented as parallel to the structure of colonialism, until it becomes more the prop erty of the colonizing world than the aesthetic one" (38). 12. See Fouchard; Price, First Time, Guiana Maroons, and Maroon Societies-, and Price and Price. 13. Bartram's tract against slavery is archived in John Bartram's effects in the broadsides collection of the His torical Society of Pennsylvania. 14. Although I interpret Bartram's decision to write this unpublished pamphlet on the back of his father's published effects as emblematic of his turn from the pub lic sphere, Kathyrn Braund pointed out to me that in the late eighteenth century the practice of reusing paper was ordinary, since paper was scarce. No doubt this is true, but it is the ordinary that gives rise to the emblematic. 15. That Bartram's account of loss verges on the ele giac is not incidental. As Peter Sacks has argued in The English Elegy, the elegiac form often works to shore up? or, rather, produce?lyric subjectivity. I would argue that the elegiac form's subjectivism, like that of the sublime, is precisely what makes it appealing to Bartram as well as what ultimately makes it impossible for him to hew suc cessfully to the conventions of the form. 16. Of course, Bartram's failures register only in a cer tain political and metaphysical tradition. One might also argue (and I do argue) that the mutation of vision and practice inspired by swamps has a good deal of transfor mative potential. On this point, I draw heavily on Deleuze and Guattari's work (Kafka and Thousand Plateaus). 17. For instance, Winthrop Jordan writes offhandedly of "[t]he [familiar] story of initial French successes, [the] treacherous seizure of Toussaint, and eventual defeat at the hands of yellow fever and a British blockade" (377). 18. This shift is in no sense simple, since eighteenth century Anglo-European texts often contribute to the land scape tradition that enabled colonialism and at the same time to an emergent ecological tradition that compromised it. 19. It may not be possible, or even desirable, to imag ine a revolution that eliminates all forms of hierarchy. In any case, it would not be historically accurate to say that in Haiti revolution shifted from a vertical to a horizontal phe nomenon. Since Hegel followed events in Saint-Domingue, he presumably noticed this. Starting with Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and even more clearly with Henri Cristophe, the Haitian state became organized hierarchically, al though, as Trouillot's work suggests, monarchial ambitions did not have the same meanings in Haiti as elsewhere. 20.
