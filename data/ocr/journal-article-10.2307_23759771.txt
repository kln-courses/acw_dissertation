Thomas Gann (1895-97) identified and briefly reported on ancient Sarteneja, which he found beneath a modern Maya/mestizo village that was settled in the mid-nineteenth Century by refugees from the Caste War of Yucatan. Additio nal evidence (Sidrys 1983) suggested a Late Preclassic (250 B.C.-A.D. 250) Community that evolved into a vibrant sea port or transshipment depot during the Terminal Classic/Ear ly Postclassic (A.D. 1000-A.D. 1200) epoch. The current re search links Sarteneja to the Maya orbit by producing addi tional and comparable data. The far northeastern Corozal district is isolated and heavi ly forested, and despite brief forays by various investigators, had been virtually ignored until the présent study (Fig. 2). As is too often the case in Belize (and Mesoamerica), looters and vandals are intimately acquainted with the local terrain, archaeological sites, and their precise locations. Unfortunate ly, miscreants are rapidly destroying Maya cities while feed ing the voracious collecting avarice of the art-buying Com munity. Pothunting was extensive in and around Sarteneja, which significantly influenced the direction of my work. Not only did I address the research questions posed below, but I also spent an unexpected amount of time salvaging data from scores of looters' trenches as well as addressing Community groups and public forums about the cultural and economic values of archaeology and site préservation. Through the application of standard archaeological field methods (e.g., stratigraphie excavation, site survey, surface collecting, and mapping), I sought answers to the following research questions: 1) What role did long-distance exchange play in Overall site development? 2) What locally acquired resources could have been procu red and/or exchanged for exotics? 3) How extensive and intensive was marine resource procu rement through time, and how was this reflected in the archaeological record (e.g., subsistence and settlement patterns)? 4) What was Sarteneja's occupational history? Fig. 3) Conch shell artifact surface collected west of Sarteneja village; 5.7 x 3.56 cm. General Description of the Site Archaeological research focused on three locales. Along the coast investigations were designed to define the east-west boundaries and to collect subsistence data by test-excavating non-elite résidences and associated refuse middens. At the site core, located inland among privately-owned farms, we sought data on Postclassic architectural style and construction methods. Around the southern outskirts of ancient Sarteneja (marked by a decrease in masonry structures), we noted five mounds which contrasted in appearance and composition with those observed in the site core or along the coast. We ex cavated one of these mounds to ascertain its age and function. Coastal Excavation Coastal reconnaissance radiated east and west from Sarte neja village. We hoped to define the east-west site boundaries by plotting the distribution of pot sherds, stone tools, lithic waste, and house mounds found eroding from the Sarteneja shoreline. Sarteneja' s eastern boundary was naturally demar cated by a swampy bajo just outside the modern village. The western boundary, though still undefined, appears to run for 2 km from the center of town, judging from the continuous scatter of cultural materials (Fig. 3). The majority of the ancient Sarteneja population lived along the coast and probably intensively exploited their envi ronment. House mounds of the non-elite, eroding for 2 km west of Sarteneja village, produced copious evidence of anci ent Maya diet: fish bones, molluscs, and marine mammal re mains. Deep water molluscs indigenous to the Belizean coral reef suggest a considerable catchment zone. The northern most portion of the archaeological site might have produced useful data about marine resource processing and long-dis tance water-borne exchange, but has either washed into Che tumal Bay or has been incorporated into modern-day houses. The Site Core The ceremonial and political-administrative heart of Sarteneja (Group A) contains twenty-four structures grouped around a formal plaza with off-shore courtyards (Fig. 4). Sarteneja's tallest édifice, Structure 1, rises 12.3 meters abo ve the plaza-floor. On the whole, Sarteneja structures are less than 5 meters in height.

Typical components include unshaped or rectangular hammer-dressed block and veneer facing stones, often cemented with lime mortar and sometimes tenoned to a dry-stone rubble hearting. The précision of Classic Period (A.D. 300- A.D. 900) masons is absent. The site core was probably home to Sarteneja elite, and is characterized by collapsed masonry architecture, two documented tombs, and at least five adjunct building groups (B-F), three wells, a chultun, and at least two artificial réservoirs (see Sidrys 1983). Structure 30 A joint UCLA-Belizean Department of Archaeology ef fort to consolidate Structure 30, a well-preserved mound and prime example of Early Postclassic elite residential architec ture, was a highlight of the field season. In this project, we combined our shared interests in Postclassic architecture, site préservation, and tourism by attempting to increase public awareness and local appréciation for national héritage (Figs. 5, 6. and 7). Fig. 5) Initially a 7.0 by 3.4 m masonry-faced platform that sup ported a building made of perishable materials, Structure 30 was developed into a four-roomed superstructure. Limestone-slab bed doorway jambs diminished the stress caused by the masonry walls and corbel-vaulted ceilings. Rounded corner stones were a hallmark of Postclassic Sarteneja architecture. Photograph taken after consolidation, August, 1986. Structure 30 was built during the Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic era and was renovated three times within two or three hundred years. These rénovations probably reflect a period of cultural and economic vitality in Sarteneja prehisto ry - when site development was characterized by population growth, a flurry of architectural activity, and the intra- and interregional flow of ideas and trade between Sarteneja and other Maya cities. Tomb 1 Excavations of the partially looted Tomb 1 yielded a variety of mortuary furniture. We rescued the skeletal re mains of thirteen human beings and a small dog, six pottery vessels, a jadeite bead, three wands or pendants carved from the central columellas of the Strombus (conch) shell (Figs. 8 and 9), a copper bell, a quartz crystal bead fragment, and forty-two pièces of gold foil. The largest specimen (6.0 cm) still holds the rectangular shape of the object it may have covered in ancient times. Stylistically distinctive Tulum-like redware and Mayapan-related non-effigy censers provide further evidence of Late Postclassic ties to the Yucatan Peninsula. Fig. 6) Axonometrie drawing of Group F, Structure 30, phase A (roofless). The Southern Mounds The southern mounds were generally beige to tannish brown in color, and lacked the typical limestone masonry noted in the site core. Excavations at Mound 20 produced a three meter deposit of processed limestone and sascab inter mixed with poorly preserved redware sherds. The combina tion of materials may represent an accumulation of industrial residue from some as-yet-unidentified activity, perhaps quicklime production or lime slaking. Burnt sherds with ex foliating surfaces and innumerable waster fragments suggest open-air pottery firing. Thin section and x-ray diffraction analyses of Mound 20 soils currently underway at the UCLA Department of Geology and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will test this hypotesis.

Conclusions The 1986-87 archaeological field season at Sarteneja, Belize, produced evidence of diet, settlement patterns, re source procurement, and occupational history. Düring the 33</page><page sequence="5">field season we sampled a cross-section of Sarteneja Maya teneja's cultural apogee. Despite the profund commercial society: an elite tomb and residence, non-elite refuse, and prosperity of other Late Postclassic settlements, Sarteneja what may represent an industrial and/or craft specialization could not parlay its strategic location on Chetumal Bay, or its locus. Until the final report on the 1986-87 field study is newly forged ties to the Mayapan and/or Ecab/Cozumel poli completed, observations on the findings remain preliminary. ties, to any commercial advantage. It appears that Sarteneja did not play a major role in the circumpeninsular trade docu mented elsewhere in north coastal Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula.
