As a result, a good majority of the wood-carvings now in use, or on display in museums, are hardly more than two or three generations old, so that we lack enough evidence to reconstruct their historical or stylistic develop- ment.2 However, a number of ancient works in more durable materials like stone, terracotta and metal have either been preserved in shrines, washed out of the ground by rain or stumbled upon at construction sites or when graves are being dug. But in the absence of written records or any other dating evidence, the age of such objects cannot be determined.3 The only datable works we have at present are those recovered by archae- ology, and it is on these that the art history of Nigeria is being built. In this paper, I shall review the progress made so far, and offer suggestions that might shed new light on some of the problems created by the paucity of art historical evidence. The Art of Benin Scholarly interest in the ancient arts of Nigeria dates from the last years of the nineteenth century: when the British Punitive Expedition sacked Benin in I897, thousands of bronze objects and other art treasures were 1 This is a revised version of a paper first presented in March I973 at one of the weekly Seminars of the Institute of African Studies, University of Ife, Nigeria.

Later, these acquisitions were catalogued and published.4 Such is the technical perfection of these bronzes that scholars at first attributed their origin to the Portuguese,5 with whom Benin had estab- lished contact as early as the fifteenth century A.D. However, this assump- tion was later discarded partly because possible prototypes for Benin art could not be found in the whole history of Portuguese or even European art,6 and partly because of the Benin tradition which claims that the art of bronze-casting was imported from Ife, whose bronze art is widely believed to antedate the arrival of Europeans in West Africa. The first significant work on the chronology of Benin bronzes is that of von Luschan, who proposed three major periods of stylistic develop- ments. To the first or Early Period (extending up to the end of the fifteenth century), he assigned many of the relatively realistic/semi-natural- istic heads. To the second period, which he called the Great Age (I500- I69I), he ascribed a group of bronze heads and many of the bronze plaques on the ground that they are less naturalistic and therefore must have been made later. I69I onwards was regarded as the Decline Period: the bronze heads assigned to this period are extremely stylized.7 Next in importance to von Luschan's chronology is that of his pupil, Bernard Struck. Being based on von Luschan's works and differing only in details, Struck's chronology is usually considered along with that of his master. However, his own chronology is much more subjective. Arbitrarily assigning Christian dates to the reigns of all Benin Obas and correlating these with the stylistic variations exhibited by a number of heads, Bernard Struck distinguished five main periods: the Archaic (II40-I360), the Early (I360-I500), the Great Age (I500-I69I), the Late (I69I-I820), and the Modern (I820-97).8 For a long time, the chronologies of von Luschan and Struck remained unchallenged. But they were later to be rendered obsolete by the publi- cation of Jacob Egharevba's book,9 the discovery in European archives of records bearing on the early history of Benin,'0 the research of R.

Armed with the results of his own field and museum research and some of the new evidence supplied by Egharevba, William Fagg has proposed a new chronology,14 which is now widely accepted. Like von Luschan, he divides the development of Benin bronzes into three main periods. In view of the Benin tradition that the technique of bronze casting was imported from Ife, William Fagg attributes the more realistic/semi- naturalistic Benin bronze heads to the Early Period (c. A.D. I500) because of their relative naturalism which, according to him, should inevitably connect them with Ife bronzes.15 Taking about A.D. I400 or thereabouts as the time when the technique of bronze casting was introduced to Benin, Fagg tries to account for the stylistic difference between the supposedly early Benin heads and those of Ife: If we assume that these early heads are in lineal descent from the Ife bronzes which we know (and not, as is possible, from earlier or later examples as yet undiscovered), then IOO years-let us say the fifteenth century-would seem a long enough interval to account for the changes which had evidently taken place; and, considering that Benin ... sculpture was probably, then as now, of a highly conceptual character, whereas the imported style of Ife was based on a sensitive naturalism in the spirit and not merely in the letter.16 Other characteristics used by Fagg to distinguish heads of the Early Period are: thinness of casting (attributed to the scarcity of metal in this period), low beaded collar, and four keloid marks above each eye. To the second or Middle Period(mid-sixteenth century to the seventeenth century) are assigned a number of heads which show a slight trace of Ife naturalism. The increasing supply of raw metal to Benin by the Portuguese and other European traders between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is believed to have resulted in heavier and more elaborate castings: the beaded collar is now higher, almost enclosing the chin. In I702, a Dutch visitor to Benin, Nyendael, reports that bronze heads were being used to support elephant tusks: from this Fagg con- cludes that the tradition of placing tusks on bronze heads would seem to 11 R.

Like von Luschan and Struck, Fagg regards these bronzes as decadent.21 In a recent study, Philip Dark has elaborated on Fagg's chronology, although he confines himself to the bronze heads.22 While William Fagg's chronology has made better sense of the available evidence and rightly deserves its current acceptance, its main problem is that it has been heavily biased by the story that bronze-casting was introduced to Benin from Ife. According to this story: Oba Oguola wished to introduce brass-casting into Benin so as to produce works of art similar to those sent to him from Ife. He therefore sent to the Oni of Ife for a brassmith and Iguegha was sent to him.23 Although Jacob Egharevba puts the reign of Oba Oguola in the thir- teenth century A.D.,24 R. E. Bradbury has suggested the late fourteenth century.25 In any case, it is now generally assumed that Iguegha intro- duced to the Bini not only the technique of bronze-casting but also Ife naturalism.26 This assumption has given rise to the chronological formula: 17 Ibid. 35-7- 18 Ibid. 33. 19 Ibid. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid. 37-8. 22 P.

Like the defunct 'Degeneration Theory' of the nineteenth century (which sought to reconstruct the sequence by which a naturalistic prototype gradually degenerated into a less naturalistic or more abstract form)27, this formula overlooks the possibility that a 'later' artist or perpetuator of an artistic tradition may be so talented as to equal or even exceed the standard set by his predecessors, while still remaining within the bounds of that tradition. Indeed, the creative act is so varied that two works by the same hand can sometimes exhibit a wide stylistic and qualitative difference and can even appear to be by two different artists, separated in time by three centuries or more. In short, unless art work can be correlated with some other firm dating evidence, no formal sequence, however logical visually, can ever hope to be chronologically accurate. For instance, the existence of a tradition in Benin that Oba Osemwede (I8I6-47)28 invented the 'winged crown' has helped us to define the temporal limit of bronze heads with this feature.29 But William Fagg is inclined to think that bronze heads with this feature might have been made before the reign of Oba Osemwede solely because one of these heads exhibits a certain sensitivity that can only have come from the artists of an earlier period.30 This argument clearly betrays the a priori basis of his chronological scheme. In the absence of the Osemwede tradition, or on the basis of its exceptional sensitivity alone, one wonders whether the bronze head in question could not have been assigned to the Middle or even Early Period. As a matter of fact, none of the supposedly early Benin heads has been precisely dated, so that neither the 'low beaded collar', the 'four keloid marks' nor 'thinness of casting' has any chronological value. For instance the four keloid marks feature prominently on the highly stylized Odudua masks which Fagg, however, dates to the nineteenth century.3' Similarly, the low beaded collar appears on a head which is said to represent an eighteenth century Obi of Oburuku.32 Thus none of these characteristics is exclusive to any particular period. Furthermore, while it is possible that the scarcity of raw metal in the early period may partly be responsible for 'thinness of casting', technical virtuosity is a factor which makes it possible for thin castings to have been made in the later periods, when raw metal was available in large quantities. William Fagg's chronology is also responsible for popularizing the idea that the early Benin heads are of brass while the later ones are of tin-bronze.33 Spectro-graphic 27 A. A.

According to Willett, this head seems to suggest that early forms were copied in later periods. 33 Fagg, Nigerian Images, 35.</page><page sequence="6">T98 BABATUNDE LAWAL analysis of many Benin heads and plaques, however, has revealed a pre- dominance of brass, thus contradicting the notions that brass = early, and that tin-bronze = later.34 Admittedly, Werner's recent analyses of some of the objects assigned to the Early, Middle and Late periods do show that the zinc-content of the castings increases in general in the later periods35-and this somewhat corroborates William Fagg's chronology. However, not much can be inferred from these analyses until a more representative sampling is available. There can be no doubt that a 'naturalistic intent' is decipherable in some of these so-called Early Period heads, yet this is a far cry from the naturalism of the Ife heads.36 This raises the questions whether Iguegha really came from present-day Ife, and if he did, at what period in the development of Ife art he left Ife for Benin. Certain works have been attributed to him: among these are a group of terracotta heads which he is said to have brought with him from Ife, and a small bronze figure in ceremonial regalia.37 But oddly enough, these terracotta heads are in the characteristic Bini style, so that it is unlikely that he brought them from Ife, which produced the naturalistic heads. On the other hand, the small bronze figure in ceremonial regalia is in the Ife style; but then its antiquity is uncertain, and it could well have been imported later. Thus while the evidence so far at our disposal does not provide any clue as to the real identity of Iguegha (and this name is not Yoruba, unless he assumed it when he decided to settle in Benin), and when he may have come to Benin, neither does it justify the present tendency to treat Benin Bronze art (especially the heads) as an extension, in a degenerate form, of Ife naturalism. The assumption that Benin must have imported the technique of bronze-casting along with Ife naturalism has not taken full cognizance of the fact that this technique is no more than a vehicle of expression. The vehicle and what it expresses are two different things: technique per se is not necessarily expression. Conversely, if the technique was really introduced from Ife, Bini artists may have used it only to trans- late into a more permanent medium a pre-existing style in wood, clay or ivory. 38 And in that case, the early Benin bronze heads need not have been in the Ife style. Especially since it is an intellectual exercise, at no stage in learning the technique will the student be required to copy a physical model, so that the question of a gradual de-naturalization of an Ife proto- type does not arise. It is therefore unnecessary to assume a century-wide hiatus, as William Fagg has done,39 in order to explain the stylistic differ- 34 T.

Apart from the small bronze figure in ceremonial regalia mentioned earlier, two Benin bronze pendants,41 a bracelet42 and a vase43 depict figures with facial striations reminiscent of the Ife heads. While one might be tempted to take such representations as evidence of a stylistic influence (especially since the artists would seem to have seen works of art from Ife), the peculiar contexts of these striated faces-one is surmounted by an elephant whose trunk seems to be probing the man's skull ;44 the third head has been gagged and severed from the body,45 while the fourth head is that of a priest flanked by two attendants46-suggest that they are not Benin characters. For instance, they do not wear the typical Bini hair style. In these circumstances, there- fore, the facial striation seems to be a label of identification rather than an attempt to imitate the Ife style. It would be interesting to know the exact role and identity of these figures with striated face, especially in view of their frequent association with the ram symbol.47 By and large, since evidence of an Ife stylistic influence has yet to be convincingly demonstrated, a new and independent chronology is needed for Benin art, and this should be structured on internal evidence, rather than on an assumed continuum of Ife naturalism. It is possible, as suggested by William Fagg and others, that the tradition of making bronze plaques began 'later', that is long after the introduction of the technique of bronze-casting, especially since no possible prototype has yet been found in Ife. On the other hand, Fagg's contention that the making of these plaques in Benin must have been inspired by the Portu- guese (because relief sculpture 'is rare or non-existent in indigenous African Culture'48) should not be taken seriously. Relief sculpture is common in indigenous African art, being found not only on door panels but also on wooden containers and drums. Like the placing of tusks on bronze heads (which does not occur at Ife), it is very likely that making bronze plaques was a Benin invention.49 Philip Dark's attempt to classify the plaques according to the degree of relief is very welcome,50 as long as it is recognized as being no more than a typological exercise. 40 See also D.

According to Samuel Johnson, History of the Yorubas (Lagos, 1921), I55, one of the earliest kings of Old Oyo, Alafin Aganju, decorated his palace 'with rows of brazen posts'- which could very well be bronze plaques.

While we should count on the archaeologist to come to our aid in this respect (through radiocarbon, thermoluminescence and other dating techniques), the art historian in the mean time should subject many of the objects to closer scrutiny for any internal evidence that might possibly shed some light on their age. R. E. Bradbury has blazed the trail in his study of 'Ezomo's Ikegobo' by showing how much potentially valuable historical information can be deduced from some of the narrative representations in Benin art.52 Many of the bronze plaques may very well record the various campaigns of the Benin army, and it is possible that each campaign has its own peculiar feature or tell-tale symbol by which the artist had tried to distinguish one historical event or personage from another. For instance, there is a story that Oba Osogboa (who ruled in the sixteenth century) once waged a war against the king of 'Igbon Ibo'. The latter and 'plenty of his people' were brought to Benin, where 'Osogboa called Ahammangiwa and his boys, and asked them if they could put them in brass; they said "we can try", so they did and ... then the king nailed them on the wall of his house.'53 So far, none of the plaques by Ahammangiwa has been identified. Of course, as the late R. E. Bradbury once observed,54 it would be idle to expect the modern generation to give an accurate interpretation of objects two or three centuries old. Yet the fact remains that the plaques especially contain a good deal of valuable historical information, and no effort should be spared to find out what a cross-section of the modern generation has to say about them. It is to be hoped that more fieldwork and archival research as well as further archaeological investigation will throw additional light on the artistic past of this ancient city. The Art of Ife Although the most famous of the ancient arts of Nigeria because of its exceptional naturalism, the bronze and terracotta art of Ife is also the most enigmatic. Its presence was first made known to the outside world in I9I0 by the German explorer, Leo Frobenius.55 But since its naturalistic style 51 For this, we are grateful to William Fagg whose research has greatly advanced our knowledge of Benin art history. Although his chronology is the most reasonable at the moment, it has been necessary to point out its shortcomings (certainly the result of a dearth of absolute dating evidence) because for over a decade now it has been so widely quoted that it is beginning to acquire the status of absolute historical fact. Of course, in the absence of a better alternative, it will continue to be used. But let us hope that, from now on, it will be used with greater caution. 52 Bradbury, 'Ezomo's Ikegobo', 129-37. 53 L.

Parallels were drawn not only between the diadems of some of the Ife heads and head-dresses from North Africa and the Near East but also between certain aspects of Yoruba culture and those of the Mediterranean region.56 The existence among the Yoruba themselves of a legend of migration from the 'East' was used as corrobora- tive evidence. The speciousness of these parallels are so well known now that there is no point in dwelling on them here.57 Suffice it to say that we now have both non-naturalistic works from Ife (dating from the same period as the naturalistic ones),58 and full-length figures in the naturalistic style, which have more or less the same body proportion as the generality of African sculpture, thus making it obvious that the naturalism was the handiwork of Africans.59 Although it can now be accepted that Ife naturalism is African in origin, its exact significance is still a matter of conjecture. William Fagg has suggested that the position of Ife as the spiritual capital of the Yoruba must have accounted for a large part of the income of the town. In due course, the priests and chiefs of Ife became materialistic and worldly in outlook, so that a naturalistic art was the logical consequence.60 Frank Willett, to whom we owe much of our present knowledge of Ife art, endorses this view but adds that the life-size bronze heads may have been originally fixed to wooden armatures, dressed in royal regalia, and used in some kind of second burial ceremony 'to symbolize the dignitas of the kingship'.6' According to him, the fact that the life-size heads have no crowns could imply that they wore real ones; the holes in the neck of many of the heads could very well be the points at which they were nailed to wooden armatures. The smaller heads, on the other hand, had crowns modelled on them because real crowns would have been too large; but since these smaller heads also have holes in the neck, they too were probably fixed to wooden armatures.62 Plausible as William Fagg's suggestion might be, it has no doubt been influenced, as Arnold Rubin points out,63 by a widely held theory that art 56 J.

In other words, the less politically sophisticated a society, the more abstract is its art, and vice versa. That this theory has a limited application is borne out by the fact not all politically sophisticated societies have produced naturalistic art. Our modern civilization is certainly the most sophisticated and materialistic in human history; yet Modern Art tends towards the abstract. On the other hand, much of the art of the Paleolithic period is more or less naturalistic. Thusform in art depends on a number of factors, rather than on materialism or political sophistication alone. Willett's attempt to seek the origin of Ife naturalism in terms of function is surely a more profitable approach. But while the need to recall some of the physical attributes of the deceased during the second burial ceremony might have led to the creation of the life-size heads, the same explanation cannot fully account for the smaller heads, the full-length figures, the gagged and deformed figures and the animal representations. It would be interesting to know the reason for the stylized representations. Perhaps the most burning issue in the study of Ife art is that of its stylistic development and chronology. The only published classification is that of Willett,64 but this is no more than a grouping of the works according to the site of discovery.65 As Willett has pointed out, none of these sites can be regarded as primary, since the objects associated with them seem to have been brought from elsewhere at a relatively recent date. For instance, a group of terracotta sculptures from Ita Yemoo, dated to the twelfth century, are, stylistically, so similar to those found at Igbo Obameri that both groups could easily have been taken as contemporary. Yet radio- carbon determinations from Igbo Obameri produced an eighteenth- century date, thus suggesting that the finds were ancient pieces later re-used about this time.66 Terracotta figures similar to the Ita Yemoo and Igbo Obameri finds have been excavated by Ekpo Eyo at Lafogido (twelfth century) and Odo Ogbe (sculpture reburied in the seventeenth century)67 and by Peter Garlake at Obalara's Land (fourteenth century).68 Although the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century dates from Odo Ogbe and Igbo Obameri respectively may indicate 're-deposition' of old sculptures, we should not rule out altogether the possibility of works produced in the later periods being as accomplished, technically and stylistically, as those produced earlier.

Almost certainly, Ife naturalism was not fully developed at its inception, and so must have had a pre-naturalistic phase. But, given the conservative tendency in African culture and the stereotyping of form in African sculpture, it is conceivable that once naturalism was achieved at Ife, it soon became idealized or stabilized, as were the forms of Yoruba woodcarvings, especially the facial masks of the Gelede and Epa. In short, since naturalistic sculptures have been found or used at Ife in contexts ranging between the twelfth and the eighteenth centuries, one cannot see the justification for the use of the term 'Classical' to designate the hypothetical period when naturalism was at its peak,69 especially when there is as yet no archaeological evidence for the 'pre-Classical' or 'post-Classical' phase. Therefore, given the co-existence of naturalism and extreme stylization right through the whole period of Ife art,70 our main hope of reconstructing the history of its development seems to rest on being able to date directly many of the objects, especially the casually found ones. Fortunately, some of the casually found terracotta sculptures are now being subjected to thermoluminescence dating, so that one hopes that enough dates will soon be available to make a chronological classification possible. One of the most baffling things about Ife art is the conspicuous absence of any living trace at present-day Ife of the artistic tradition which pro- duced these famous bronze and terracotta sculptures. The only explanation we have at present for this phenomenon is the story which tells of a mass slaughter of artists and sculptors at some point in the distant past, because they had conspired with some courtiers to keep the news of the death of a certain well-loved Oni from the public. The bronze-casters had made an effigy of the deceased Oni and placed it on the throne, and to this effigy the unsuspecting chiefs and other members of the court paid homage. But soon the trick was discovered: thereupon the heir-apparent ordered the execution of all the artists.71 Even if this story is based on some historical event, the total absence of any living trace of this artistic tradition is still a mystery. Ife also has a large number of ancient stone sculptures and monoliths, most of which are still in use. However, they have received far less scholarly attention than the bronze and terracotta art. So far, only Frank Willett72 and Philip Allison73 have considered them seriously. Although it is suspected that they are made about the same time as most of the bronzes and terracottas, as yet no attempt has been made to classify them chronologically. 69 Willett, Ife in the History, 66-7, and F.

Since then terracotta figurines in the same style have turned up within an area of about 300 miles north and south of the Niger-Benue confluence. Radiocarbon dates from two of the sites indicate that these figurines were being produced as early as the fifth century B.C. and as late as the third century A.D.74 Since most of them are in fragments, it is difficult to know their precise number, or the exact size of the larger pieces. However, it is possible to divide them into two major groups: human and animal figures. The human figures are depicted in a rather stylized manner, while the animal figures are much more naturalistic. Nevertheless the two groups of representation are unified by the same treatment of the eye-defined by semi-circular or triangular lids, and a pierced pupil. The full report on the Nok excavations is not yet available; only a few of the terracottas have been published and no chronological classification has been attempted. As a result, our knowledge of Nok art has hardly advanced beyond what we knew two decades ago. This stand- still is partly due to the ill health which prevented Bernard Fagg from continuing with the Nok excavations. Now that Angela Fagg has taken over, it is to be hoped that this long awaited report will soon be published. In any case, indications that other terracotta traditions had flourished in present-day northern Nigeria about the same time as that of Nok have recently come to light at Daima,75 Yelwa,76 Kagogi,7 and near Zaria,78 although only the ones from Daima and Yelwa have been dated. The Daima figurines, mostly theriomorphic, have been dated between the sixth century B.C. and the early part of the second millennium A.D., while those from Yelwa, some of which are anthropomorphic, have been dated between the second and the eighth centuries A.D. Although the pierced pupil of the Yelwa and the Zaria terracottas is reminiscent of Nok,79 this being the only point of comparison, it is difficult to say at the moment whether there is any relationship between them.

These parallels not only imply that these peoples may be the modern descendants of the ancient people of Nok, but also that the terracotta tradition now found among them, especially among the Dakakari, is of great antiquity, if not a metamorphosed phase of the Nok mode.80 The determination of such questions must, however, await more archaeological excavations in this area. The Nok-Ife Relationship According to Frank Willett, A comparison of Nok and Ife sculptures, however, leaves one with little doubt that there is a cultural and artistic connection between them, though the precise nature of the link remains obscure.... The fragments of trunks and limbs are very similar indeed in their simplification, despite the great naturalism of Ife faces. In both styles the sculptures are sometimes set on a globular base; the hair is occasionally represented. The figures are usually heavily beaded: not only are large numbers of anklets and bracelets worn, but the arrangement of beads on the chest is very similar in many cases in both traditions-a heavy rope of beads overlies many strings of smaller beads which cover the whole chest....8' The Ife culture of the Classical period evidently draws much of its artistic traditions from that of Nok, or from a common ancestor.82 While this possibility should not be ruled out completely, the evidence available so far is too tenuous to support Willett's hypothesis. The fact that fragments of the trunks and limbs of Nok and Ife figures are similar in their simplification would have been acceptable as stylistic evidence were it not that this quality is not exclusive to both, being found in varying de- grees in sculptures from many parts of Africa. Since less attention is usually paid to the trunks and limbs in most African sculptures, only the facial features could be reliably used to distinguish the sculptures of a given African group from those of its neighbours. In short, without the heads (which are rendered differently at Nok and Ife), the sculptures of many African groups would look similar in their simplification, especially if they are in fragments, as are many Nok and Ife terracottas. Lastly, the fact that some of the Nok and Ife figures are set on a globular or round base and that they wear a profusion of beads, anklets and bracelets implies no more than a 'cultural similarity', as Willett himself now admits.83 By and large, the theory of a stylistic relationship between Nok and Ife assumes that there was a transference of artistic forms or ideas from one to the other. At present there is no concrete evidence for this theory. 80 Willett, Ife in the History, 115-17. 81 Willett, African Art, 73. 82 Willett, Ife in the History, 110-17, 125. 83 Willett, African Art, 73.</page><page sequence="14">zo6 BABATUNDE LAWAL The Art of Owo In 1971, Ekpo Eyo excavated a number of terracotta sculptures at Owo, about a hundred miles southeast of Ife. Some of these sculptures are in the naturalistic Ife style, and a few others in the Benin style. A third cate- gory of objects exhibits a style which is unlike that of Ife or Benin. This has been called the Owo style.84 These finds are now dated between the fifteenth and the eighteenth centuries A.D. Although it is possible, as Eyo points out, that the influence of Ife art might have been transferred to Benin via Owo, so that the Owo style could very well be the 'missing link' between the naturalism of Ife and the schematism of Benin,85 we need more concrete evidence before this possibility can be taken seriously. At the moment, all that can be said with any degree of certainty is that Owo is the meeting-point of Ife and Benin art styles, just as its culture is a blend of Yoruba and Benin (Edo) elements. The Nupe Bronzes This is a heterogeneous group of bronzes found mostly in the Nupe villages of Jebba and Tada, and associated with the Nupe culture-hero, Tsoede, who allegedly smuggled them out of Idah some time in the sixteenth century.86 Although the outline of the Tsoede legend has been confirmed in modern Idah (but there are many contradictory versions),87 bronzes similar to those imported to Nupe by Tsoede have not been found there, nor can any evidence of ancient bronze-casting be traced.88 But, oddly enough, one of these bronzes, the so-called 'Seated Tada Figure',89 is so naturalistic that many scholars regard it as 'certainly by an Ife master'.90 Another figure in the group, the so-called 'Gara',91 has a head medallion showing a face with keloid marks above each eyebrow like many of the Benin heads, and a terracotta head from Owo.92 In short, the Nupe bronzes have so many iconographic affinities with Ife and Benin Art (e.g. 'crown of birds',93 'human face with snakes emerging from the 84 E.

The problem posed by these bronzes is such that we must reconsider the early connexions between Ife, Benin, Nupe and Idah. So far, only Alan Ryder has seriously addressed himself to this problem, though with an emphasis on the Ife-Benin relationship.96 In view of a Portuguese account that Benin owed allegiance to a monarch called 'Ogane' whose kingdom lay to the north-east of Benin, Ryder contends that 'Ogane' could not have been the 'Oni' of modern Ife (which lies to the north-west), but that if he was, then Ife in the fifteenth century would seem to have been situated either somewhere near the Niger-Benue confluence or the area bordering the middle Niger.97 Given the fact that the cross symbol which the Portuguese identified with 'Ogane' also appears on the 'Gara' figure, as well as in Benin art, he suggests that the Nupe bronzes might once have been associated with the same 'Ogane'.98 Ryder's attempt to locate Ife of the fifteenth century further north has been challenged by Frank Willett with the radiocarbon dates from Orun Oba Ado, which indicate that modern Ife has been occupied since the ninth century A.D. ;99 and by Akinjogbin, who suspects that the Portuguese were confused about the location. According to Akinjogbin, modern Ife is widely known, even in Benin, as Ife onddiye, Ibi ojtu ti im4 wd (Ife the creator of the world, from where the light comes), so that the Portuguese would seem to have misinterpreted the phrase 'from where light comes' as referring to the light of the sun, thus locating Ife in the east; whereas the phrase means no more than a place where culture and civilization spread to other lands.'00 Thus one wonders how much reliance should be placed on the Portu- guese story, especially since the Benin name for the Oni of Ife is 'Oghene', which the Portuguese could very well have transcribed as 'Ogane'. But supposing they did not mistake the direction (given the presence in Benin art of the cross emblem which they identified with the 'Ogane'), is it not possible for Benin to have owed allegiance in the fifteenth century to another kingdom, apart from Ife? To answer this question, we must consider two possibilities. The first concerns one of the best-remembered wars in Benin history in which Oba Esigie is said to have defeated the Idah Army, driving them 94 Willett, Ife in the History, 170-2. 95 Willett, 'The Benin Museum', pls. 3, 4, 17 and I9.

Before the sixteenth century, the Nupe are said to have been subject to Idah until Tsoede succeeded in throwing off the yoke.'02 In view of the fact that most of the bronzes similar to the Nupe ones have been found in Benin (and William Fagg has isolated some of them from the corpus of Benin art on the ground that they do not belong stylistically'03), could it be that Tsoede formed an alliance with Oba Esigie, as a result of which the booty from Idah was shared between them? Possibly, this alliance was hinted at in Bussa when Hugh Clapperton was told 'That Nyffe people and those of Benin were the same people'.'04 It is not certain, however, whether Benin was subject to Idah before Esigie ascended the throne; but the reason given for the war by Egharevba (that a disgruntled Benin chief had instigated Idah to attack Benin in retaliation for Oba Esigie's role in causing his wife to commit adultery)'05 is suspect. In effect, we might consider the possibility that Idah (of the Tsoede legend) and the kingdom of the 'Ogane' (of the Portuguese account) were identical. The second possibility centres on the identity of the figures with facial striations in Benin bronzes. As mentioned earlier, these figures may well represent non-Benin personages. One of the best preserved of these bronzes, a pendant plaque in the Benin Museum,06 shows a figure carrying a disk-headed staff similar to the one carried by one of the dwarf figures in the Nupe bronze complex.'07 In view of the ram-head symbol promin- ently displayed on his right hip and on the right hip of another figure which also holds a disk-headed staff,'08 one has the impression that these are non-Benin functionaries or, in cases where the face is not striated, the local priests of a cult in which the ram was sacred. The ram pendant prominently displayed on the chest of the Nupe 'Gara' figure immediately comes to mind. In fact, it is possible that the staff once held by the 'Gara' (but now lost) might have been disk-headed, like those held by the Benin 'striated-face' figures. The face on the head medallion of the 'Gara' not only has serpents emerging from the nostrils (as in Ife and Benin art), but also a pair of (ram's?) horns on the head. Unfortunately, the face of the 'Gara' itself is not striated. Another figure in the Nupe complex, the 'Jebba Warrior','09 has facial marks, but those are not striations. 101 Ryder, 'A Reconsideration', 36, and Bradbury, 'Chronological Problems', 280. 102 According to S. F. Nadel, Tsoede is said to have 'delivered Nupe country from the supremacy of Idah, and established the independent Nupe kingdom'.

To the extent that the representation of the animal could be worn by priests as a badge of office, the cult might have had a political function in addition to its religious ones.110 Therefore, in identifying the Idah of the Tsoede legend and possibly the kingdom of 'Ogane', it may perhaps be useful to keep this cult in mind as one of our historical guides, although this is not to imply that all the representations of the ram among the Edo, Yoruba and Igala necessarily originated with the cult."'1 One other representation in Benin art that might also help in locating the Idah of the Tsoede tradition is the figure wearing the Maltese cross pendant.12 According to Joao Afonso d'Aveiro, who visited Benin around I485, a new Oba of Benin usually sent messengers with rich gifts to the 'Ogane', so that he would confirm the Oba in office. As symbols of this approval, the 'Ogane' sent a brass staff, hat and pectoral cross. As a reward for making the journey from Benin, each messenger received a pectoral cross similar to that given to the new Oba of Benin, and this he wore round his neck.1"3 In Benin art, figures wearing such pectoral crosses almost always have the cat-whisker cheek marks. Although terracotta heads with cat-whisker marks have been found in modern Ife,"14 they are not associated with crosses.115 On the other hand, crosses appear on the Nupe 'Gara' figure,1"6 although none of the Nupe bronzes wear the cat- 110 Elsewhere (B. Lawal, 'Yoruba Sango Sculpture in Historical Retrospect'. Unpubl. Ph.D. Dissertation, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1970, 140-65), I have tried to link this cult with the ancient kingdom of Old Oyo where the ram was sacred to Sango, the Yoruba god of thunder and lightning. For in the heyday of the Old Oyo Empire, the Sango cult was used as a political weapon: a good number of Old Oyo governors resident in the vassal states were priests of the cult; and when they were not, they had Sango priests in their entourage. 1"I The task of using the ram symbolism as a guide is rendered all the more difficult by the fact that at Owo and Benin wooden ram heads are placed on ancestral altars while smaller ones in the bronze and ivory are stitched to the ceremonial dresses of some chiefs. Nevertheless, a thorough investigation of the origin and significance of the ram symbolism at Benin and Owo is likely to have some implications for the representation of the animal on the Nupe 'Gara' figure, and on many of the so-called 'Lower Niger Bronzes' as well. For a preliminary study of the ram symbolism among the Oyo Yoruba, see B. Lawal, 'Yoruba-Sango Ram Symbolism: From Ancient Sahara or Dynastic Egypt?', in African Images: Essays in African Iconology, eds. D. F. McCall and E. G.

Nevertheless, representations of the Maltese cross do occur in Ife art. See ibid., pl. 58, and Willett, 'New Light', 39-40. 116 Although the Maltese cross appears only on the robe of the Nupe 'Gara' figure, it is certainly more than a mere decoration. Among the Ashanti, for instance, this type of cross is called Musuyidie (something which removes evil). According to Rattray, a cloth with Maltese cross design was placed beside the sleeping couch of the Ashantene who, 14 AH XVIII</page><page sequence="18">2IO BABATUNDE LAWAL whisker marks. At any rate, what seems to be obvious from the representa- tion of the Maltese cross in Benin art is that most of the figures wearing it could be identified as messengers from the 'Ogane'.117 And given the fact that these figures wear the cat-whisker marks which both the Yoruba and Bini generally associate with the people of the middle Niger/Benue area, Ryder's contention that the kingdom of 'Ogane' might have been situated somewhere in this region should be given a serious consideration. As a matter of fact, the middle Niger/Benue area features prominently in the early history of the Yoruba. Not only do many Yoruba hold the view that modern Ife is not the original Ife,118 there are references in odu ifa (Yoruba sacred divination verses) to seven different Ife, the present one being the last.119 A hint that a part of the modern Yoruba migrated to present-day Ife from across the Niger is given in the Lamurudu legend which tells of the expulsion of the Yoruba from 'Mecca' and that the journey from the latter to modern Ife took ninety days.120 A journey of go days from Saudi Arabian Mecca is a most unlikely story. That the 'Mecca' in this legend could not have been too far from the eastern/north- eastern border of modern Nigeria is implied in the attempt by Oranmiyan (the alleged founder of the ruling dynasties in Benin and Oyo) to return to this 'Mecca' and avenge the expulsion of the Yoruba. But when Oranmiyan attempted to cross the Niger, The Tapas [Nupe] are said to have opposed his crossing the river, and as he could not force his way through, he was obliged to remain for a while near the banks, and afterwards resolved to retrace his steps.121 Thus Oranmiyan's attempt to cross the Niger strongly indicates that a part of the modern Yoruba once lived beyond the Niger, although the exact direction is uncertain. But that the Yoruba must have once shared a common environment with the Igala of Idah is attested by a similarity of language and cultural institutions.122 For instance, many Igala bear facial on waking up in the morning, would step on the cloth three times (R. S. Rattray, Religion and Art in Ashanti (Oxford, 1923), 226, n. I49). It is possible, therefore, that the Maltese cross pattern on the Nupe 'Gara' figure had a talismanic function, although the cross pendant given by the 'Ogane' to royal messengers from Benin is said to accord them some privileges. 117 Ryder, 'A Reconsideration', 33-4. 118 J. 0.

Unfortunately, there is some confusion with regard to the original home of the modern Igala of Idah. According to Armstrong, 'Several stories appear to bring the Igala from what is now Nupe'.123 Yet in I967 Willett collected a tradition at Idah to the effect that the Igala came, not from modern (Yoruba) Ife, but 'from another Ife beyond the Benue'.124 Could it then be that both the Yoruba and the Igala came to their present homelands from the 'Ife beyond the Benue', possibly where the title of 'Ogane' or 'Oni' might have been first used, and from where the art of bronze-casting was brought to Ife, Idah, Benin and Nupe? According to Johnson, the Yoruba are said to have been very fond of idols while they lived in 'Mecca', and, when expelled, 'escaped with two idols to Ile-Ife'.125 Could any of these be ancestral to the bronze and terracotta sculptures now found in modern Ife? However, it is important to note that the facial scarifications on some of the Ife bronze and terracotta figures remind one of the people from the Bornu and Chad areas, who still bear similar marks.126 In fact, Johnson relates the Yoruba to the Gogobiri and the Kukawa of northern Nigeria.127 Unfortunately, the events mentioned in the Lamurudu legend would seem to have occurred before the sixteenth century, so that they cannot easily be reconciled with the Idah of the Tsoede tradition, nor the 'Ogane' of the Portuguese account. None the less, if it is true that this fifteenth- century 'Ogane' referred to a Yoruba kingdom further north of Benin or near the middle Niger area, then the only Yoruba kingdom that would seem to have been strong enough during this period to rule Benin would be Old Oyo. As I have argued elsewhere,128 the fact that Oranmiyan, who allegedly founded the present ruling dynasty in Benin, is also credited with founding Old Oyo could very well mean that the Obas of Benin sent tributes to Oranmiyan or his descendants at Old Oyo, or through Ife, especially since Oranmiyan is alleged to have stayed briefly at Ife (after abdicating the Benin throne) before setting out to found Old Oyo. Also, we must note the pre-eminence of the ram symbol at Old Oyo, where it 123 Armstrong, 'The Igala', 8o. 124 Willett, 'Archaeology', 138. 125 Johnson, The History, 4. 126 Willett, Ife in the History, pls. 23, 24, and Nigerian Museum, An Introduction to the Art of Ife (Lagos, 1955), 17. 127 Johnson, The History, 3. In other literatures, this relationship has been traced to the fact that the Yoruba are said to be part of the Kisra Migration which reportedly reached West Africa from the Nile Valley in the second half of the first millennium A.D.

In fact, as I have tried to show elsewhere,132 the legend of Tsoede is so close to that of Sango (the son of Oranmiyan by the Nupe princess) that one is tempted not only to take the two characters as one and the same person but also to identify the Idah of the Tsoede tradition with Old Oyo. In that case, one might consider the possibility of the Nupe bronzes being taken as booty from Old Oyo when the latter was sacked by the Nupe in the sixteenth century, and the Alafin and his court had to seek refuge in Borgu.133 It is worth noting that in addition to the well known attribution of these bronzes to Tsoede, there is an alternative tradition, collected among the Nupe Gbedegi, to the effect that two of these bronzes, now kept in Jebba, were 'sent there from Old Oyo, for the sake of safe keeping about A.D. 1780'134 during the Nupe/ Yoruba wars.135 One might also consider the possibility that Benin participated in the sack of Old Oyo (perhaps sharing the booty with Nupe) in view of a seventeenth century Dutch account that the father of Ehengbuda scored 'a great victory over the people of Isago, a country northwest of Benin, after they had attacked him with a powerful force of cavalry'.136 The people of Isago (Sango?) might very well refer to Old Oyo, which made extensive use of cavalry, although Isago could also refer to the Nupe, as Ryder has pointed out.137 Suffice it to say that since little archaeological research 129 According to Leo Frobenius (The Voice of Africa, I, 2I0), there seem to have been two Sangos at Old Oyo. The first, Tapa-Sango, from Nupe, was symbolized by a ram, while the second, Mesi-Sango, from Borgu, was symbolized by equestrian sculpture. These are said to represent two different dynasties. Mesi-Sango is said to have once displaced Tapa-Sango, but the latter subsequently regained power. But as I have argued ,elsewhere (Lawal, 'Yoruba-Sango Sculpture', 128-39), Frobenius seems to have mistaken the dual organization of the Sango cult at New Oyo as evidence of two originally separate cults. 130 Meyerowitz, 'Four Pre-Portuguese Bronze Castings', 131. However, this need not imply that all ram representations in Benin once belonged to the Sango cult; and it must also be noted that the Benin thunder god is called Ogiuwu (king of death), but his historical relationship with Sango cannot yet be ascertained. 131 Johnson, The History, 149. 132 Lawal, 'Yoruba-Sango Sculpture' 140-2. 133 Johnson, The History, 159-60; R.

Another ancient kingdom where the origin of the Nupe bronzes might be sought is the legendary Jukun state of Kororafa which is reported in the Kano Chronicle to have dominated a large part of northern Nigeria in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. According to Arnold Rubin, the 'Ogane' may very well refer to Kororafa,140 the ruins of which, however, are yet to be located. In a recent article,141 Douglas Fraser has tentatively attributed some of the Nupe bronzes to Owo mainly because of their iconographic affinities with a bronze stool in the University of Ife Museum collection which William Fagg has assigned to Owo on iconographic evidence.142 On the other hand, J. R. 0. Ojo, the curator of the University of Ife Museum collection, is of the opinion that the same stool, though collected at Ijebu-Ode, would seem to have been made in Benin, where similar ones can be found.143 Thus, Douglas Fraser's interesting hypothesis cannot be taken very seriously until it can be supported with concrete evidence. The Igbo- Ukwu Bronzes These consist mainly of ornamental vessels, pendants, scabbards and other symbols of leadership excavated from the town of Igbo-Ukwu in the Anambra State of Nigeria.144 Although the bronzes have been dated to the ninth century A.D., the reliability of this date has been questioned 138 Willett, 'Archaeology', 1 33. 139 Nevertheless, the four Alakoro brass masks which are said to have been brought from Old Oyo do suggest the existence of a bronze-casting centre there (illustrated in R. F. Thompson, Black Gods and Kings: Yoruba Art at U.C.L.A. (Los Angeles, 1971), pls. I2-i6, and D. Williams, 'Two Brass Masks from Oyo-Ile', Odu (n.s.) iii (1966), 6I-3). It is interesting to note that, though different in style, one of the Alakoro masks (pl. I4) has keloid marks above the eyebrows like Benin bronze heads and the face of the head-medallion the Nupe 'Gara' figure. Similar keloid marks and the cat-whisker marks occur on a carved wooden object with a human face said to have been excavated by Frobenius in I9I0 from the grave of a Sango priest at Modakeke, but which might have been made at Old Oyo, especially since the people of Modakeke are refugees from Old Oyo. (This object is well illustrated in E. Leuzinger, The Sculpture of Black Africa (New York, I972), pl. i8.) Lastly, the style of a bronze armlet said to have been captured from an Old Oyo war chief (illustrated in E. L. R. Meyerowitz, 'A Bronze Armlet from Old Oyo, Nigeria', Man, XLI (194I), 25) is close enough to some of the Nupe bronzes as well as to many of the so-called alien bronzes in the Benin corpus. 140 Rubin, 'Review', 352, n. 9. 141 D. Fraser, 'The Tsoede Bronzes and Owo Yoruba Art', African Arts, VIII (1975), 30-5, 9I. 142 This attribution was made in two public lectures in 197I, one at the University of Ibadan (March) and the other at Harvard University (May). 143 J.

It is to be hoped that a comprehensive study of the bronzes from this area will soon be made. In view of the fact that some of the bronzes were associated with the burial of an important personage, Thurstan Shaw has linked the Igbo- Ukwu corpus with the institution of the Eze Nri (priest king) of the Umundri Igbo, especially since Igbo-Ukwu is very close to Oreri, the only other place, apart from Aguku, to have an Eze Nri.150 It is therefore of interest to note that the Umundri Igbo either talk of an Idah origin or of a common origin with the Igala of modern Idah.151 Of course, this need not necessarily imply that the Igbo-Ukwu bronzes might have been imported from Idah, although evidence has yet to be uncovered that they were made at Igbo-Ukwu. But, given the affinity of the Umundri Igbo with the Igala of Idah, coupled with the Tsoede tradition which links the Nupe bronzes with Idah, the need for intensive interdisciplinary research in the area bordering the Niger/Benue confluence cannot be over-emphasized. 146 B.

Unfortu- nately, not much can be said about their history in the absence of reliable dating evidence and other pertinent data. For instance, at Esie, near Ilorin, more than 8oo stone carvings have been found abandoned in the bush with no evidence whatsoever as to their origin, age and significance.152 Also problematic are the Akwanshi, the stone carvings and monoliths found among the Ekoi of the Cross River and said to represent the dead ancestors of priest-chiefs called Ntoon. About 300 of them have been recorded.153 It is to be hoped that future archaeological work at Esie and among the Ekoi will help solve some of the questions posed by these carvings. With the exception of some Benin ivories which have been dated, on stylistic grounds, to the sixteenth century,154 a good majority of Nigerian ivory carvings have not been found in a datable context. Nevertheless, they do contribute significantly to the study of the distribution of forms and symbols in the Nigerian area. As for wood carving, which must have been practised in Nigeria for several centuries, only a few of the surviving specimens are more than a hundred years old. The only exceptions are those preserved in the museum, like the ones in the Weickmann collection at Ulm which were collected in the seventeenth century.155 The absence of a significant time-depth has therefore confined the study of Nigerian woodcarvings to the stylistic and iconographic levels. Also worth mentioning are the rock paintings of northern Nigeria, especially those found at Birnin Kudu, Geji, Gudun, Bauchi and around Lake Chad. That some of them may be of great antiquity is suggested by their similarity to the prehistoric rock art of the Sahara.156 Unfortu- nately, most of these paintings are badly weathered, so that not much evidence can be extracted from them. One can only hope that better preserved examples will be discovered in the future. Conclusion It is clear from the foregoing discussion that a great deal more remains to be done before a definitive art history of Nigeria can be written.

E. Bradbury, Robert Thompson, Philip Allison and a host of others. The recent increase in the number of scholars working on Nigerian art is partly the result of the existence of an abundant literature on the subject and partly the result of the challenge posed by its problems. It is gratifying to note the arrival of some Nigerians on the scene, and it is to be hoped that when the results of current investigations are published we will be able to fill many of the gaps in our knowledge of Nigerian art history. SUMMARY This paper reviews the present state of art historical research in Nigeria with a view to clearing the ground for a more accurate interpretation of the evidence. The ancient arts of Benin, Ife, Nok, Owo, Nupe and Igbo-Ukwu are discussed, among others, and suggestions offered that might shed more light on some of the problems created by the paucity of art historical data.</page></plain_text>
