Philip Hamerton, for example, writing in 1874, announced that "if there is any thing in the world of nature that seems clear, morally, it is that man has an authentic right to demand reasonable service from the horse" (qtd. in Ritvo 20), and the Rev. J. G. Wood, in 1885, decreed that "in return for its means of existence, the horse is bound to give to man the benefit of its labour" (Wood xviii). This anthropomorphic shift, moreover, is fully reversible: an article in Chambers's Journal for 1855 describes how Mrs. Robinson's slack governance of her household has resulted in anarchy ? because she has "long let the reins go," Heaven only knows "where her household will drive to" ("Kitchen and Parlour" 98). A manual on domestic management quoted by Pamela Horn advises that "the greatest 'kindness' we can exercise towards" our employees "is to endeavour, by a mild rein, to keep them in the path of duty" (112-13). The effect of this two-way figurative traffic for a reading of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty (1877) should be fairly clear. The book's eponymous hero, brought up from infancy to habits of docility and obedience, impervious to the temptations of strong drink, unable to betray confidences, incapable of impertinence, and even, by implication, safely emasculated, represents the ideal Victorian servant ? an ideal whose desirability seems the more urgent when Beauty is contrasted with a fair proportion of Sewell's "below stairs" human characters: the alcoholic groom Smith, for example, or the stupidly cruel ploughboy Dick, or the thievish Filcher, who steals corn. As R. S. Surtees remarked in Plain or Ringlets? (1860): "Considering the number of works we have on the choice and management of horses, we wonder no master has ever favoured the public with a treatise on the choice and management of grooms" (288).1 But if Sewell presents in her equine hero a model of faithful service, the conditions under which Black Beauty labors differ markedly from those which obtain in the human world. Separated from his mother and sold while still little more than a foal ? "a horse 241</page><page sequence="2">242 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us," she resignedly tells him (12; ch. 3) ? Beauty, unlike a human servant, cannot negotiate terms but becomes the absolute property of his master. Even when his conditions are good, he is still painfully conscious of lost liberty ? the "one thing" he misses at idyllic Birtwick Park (20; ch. 6). And, as he is passed from owner to owner in a descending social scale, he becomes bitterly aware of his true value in at least some human eyes: They always seemed to think that a horse was something like a steam-engine, only smaller. At any rate, they think that if only they pay for it, a horse is bound to go just as far, and just as fast, and with just as heavy a load as they please. (104; ch. 29)2 Liable to be flogged for an inability to perform impossible tasks, Beauty is treated merely as an expendable commodity, to be sent to the knacker's yard or sold even further down market when his utility ceases: "To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard, it took the heart out of me" (175; ch. 46). The book, in fact, twice describes horse-fairs at which the narrator is sold off, emphasizing the anxiety and the humiliation of the living merchandise: "a very amusing place to those who have nothing to lose" (117; ch. 32); "the first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes" (117-18; ch. 32). Black Beauty, in short, with its forcible separations of parents and offspring, its public sales, its floggings, and its reduction of animate beings to the status of industrial machinery, chronicles the history not of an English domestic servant but of a slave. Indeed, it is possible to go further. Sewell's novel, I would suggest, bears a more than coincidental resemblance to the most celebrated of all narratives of human slavery, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, which had first been published twenty-five years before and which remained a bestseller throughout the second half of the century. Resembling Tom both in his docility and, of course, in his blackness, Beauty's career too begins in a happy home that is run on more or less enlightened feudal lines. When they are sold (in Beauty's case because the family goes abroad, in Tom's because of Mr. Shelby's financial embarrassments), both slaves experience a rise in the social order: Tom is bought by the faineant, aristocratic Mr. St. Clare of New Orleans, and Beauty passes into the stables of Lord W-. In both novels the hero saves the life of a female member of the family (Eva in Stowe's book, Lady Anne in Sewell's), and in both the humane impulses of the male head of the household are compromised by the thoughtless cruelty of his wife. Marie St. Clare has her slaves flogged because it is less trouble than treating them decently; Lady W- insists on torturing her horses in order to give her equipage a fashion able appearance. Following this period of relative, though uneasy, prosperity, Tom moves directly and Beauty by degrees toward a condition in which they are no longer regarded as sentient beings by the uncaring men who purchase them. Beauty ends up in the possession of Nicholas Skinner, a man with a mouth "as full of teeth as a bulldog's" and a voice "as harsh as the grinding of cart wheels over gravel stones" (179; ch. 47). When Beauty collapses from the strain of overwork, Skinner explains to the farrier: "My plan is to work 'em as long as they'll go, and then sell 'em for what they'll fetch, at the knacker's or elsewhere" (182; ch. 47). Similarly, Tom's last master, Simon Legree, explains to his fellow passengers on the steamer Pirate: "I don't go for savin' niggers. Use up, and buy more, 's my way; ? makes you less trouble, and I'm quite sure it comes cheaper in the</page><page sequence="3">Black Beauty and the Pressures of Indebtedness 243 end" (Stowe 485; ch. 31). Finally, just as young George Shelby arrives to redeem Tom and take him home to the plantation on which he began, so Black Beauty, saved by a whisker from a final trip to the knacker's yard, eventually finds his way back to a secure life among old friends. He is, of course, more fortunate than Tom, for George's benevolent interven tion is at the last foiled by Legree's sadism ? George finds only a dead body, not a living man. The fate of Sewell's protagonist might seem to suggest a sentimental belief in benign providence handing out suitable rewards for virtue (and Tom's reward, it is worth noting ? "His Lord knows where he lies, and will raise him up, immortal" (Stowe 593; ch. 41) ? is, from Stowe's professed viewpoint, at least equally lavish). But Black Beauty's subplot reverses, and to a degree undermines, any such comforting equation. Ginger, Beauty's stablemate at Birtwick Park, is "a tall chestnut mare, with a long handsome neck" (14; ch. 4) who has been almost consistently mistreated until her arrival at Squire Gordon's. Like Beauty, she regrets her lost freedom, but, unlike the dutiful gelding, she "fretted and pined and wanted to get loose" (23; ch. 7). The "strong, tall, bold" son in her first family, she reports, wanted "to wear all the spirit out of me, and just make me into a quiet, humble, obedient piece of horse-flesh" (23; ch. 7). At later establishments she is subjected to the bearing-rein and is flogged and beaten until she learns to counter violence with violence. Of one "hard-handed" groom, she reports that "he never dared to come into my stall again, either my heels or my teeth were ready for him, and he knew it" (27-28; ch. 8). At Lord W-'s, in a chapter entitled "A Strike for Liberty," Ginger finally refuses the bearing rein altogether and becomes briefly a hunter until she is ridden to the point of breakdown by the stupid Lord George. Thereafter, she and Beauty are separated, but Beauty catches two final glimpses of her in London. On the first occasion, she is seen drawing a "shabby old cab" outside "one of the parks" and Beauty comments on the change in her appear ance: The beautifully arched and glossy neck was now straight and lank, and fallen in, the clean straight legs and delicate fetlocks were swelled;... the face, that was once so full of spirit and life, was now full of suffering. (153; ch. 40) When Ginger describes her career of pain and drudgery to her old friend, Beauty reminds her that "You used to stand up for yourself if you were ill-used": "Ah!" she said, "I did once, but it's no use; men are strongest, and if they are cruel and have no feeling, there is nothing that we can do, but just bear it ? bear it on and on to the end. I wish the end was come, I wish I was dead." (154; ch. 40) And in a short time that despairing wish is granted, for Beauty sees Ginger's carcase being drawn on a cart past his cab-stand. The dispiriting truth that Ginger has derived from her experience ? "men are strongest" ? is a double-edged one. Her status as a horse means of course that "men" are to be understood primarily in a generic sense, as human beings, but her simultaneous career as a female slave (whose chestnut coloring even suggests the mixed ancestry prized by Southern investors) also lends the word more than a hint of gender-definition. Ginger spends most of her life as the passive victim of male aggression and exploitation, and the</page><page sequence="4">244 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE successive violations to which she is subjected are, at times, evoked in almost explicitly sexual terms: But when it came to breaking in, that was a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they closed me in at one corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock, another caught me by the nose, and held it so tight I could hardly draw my breath; then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter and the bar into my mouth; then one dragged me along by the halter, another flogging behind, and this was the first experience I had of men's kindness, it was all force; they did not give me a chance to know what they wanted. (23; ch. 7)3 The story of Ginger forms a kind of vestigial subplot in Black Beauty, counter pointing, challengingly but not consistently, the simpler moral pattern formed by Beauty's own account of virtue at last rewarded. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, similarly, there is no single developed female narrative to complement Tom's journey down river. In stead, the book diffuses its female interest, beginning with the comparatively smooth escape of the virtuous quadroon Eliza, "a fine female article" (Stowe 45; ch. 1), from the Shelbys' Kentucky estate, and ending with the Gothic flight of the mulatto Cassy from Simon Legree's plantation. "Tall and slenderly formed," like Ginger, with a "grace ful contour of . . . head and neck" (Stowe 501; ch. 33), Cassy tells Tom her history just as Ginger recounts her life to Beauty. A pattern of sexual betrayals and humiliations has been enforced by threats of violence: "they threatened to whip me, if I wasn't gayer" (Stowe 520; ch. 34). And Cassy's attempts at self-assertion are countered both by threat ? "he made me submit; he made me be peaceable" (Stowe 519; ch. 34) ? and by consignment to auction. The lesson Cassy has learned from her life's story, and which she imparts to Tom, is similar, and is similarly expressed, to that which Ginger recounts to Beauty: You were a brave fellow, ? you had the right on your side; but it's all in vain, and out of the question, for you to struggle. You are in the devil's [i.e., Legree's] hands; he is the strongest, and you must give up! (Stowe 511; ch. 34) Even so, Cassy herself never gives up, and her eventual reunion with a long-lost daughter on free soil serves to underline a crucial and obvious difference between Uncle Tom's Cabin and Black Beauty: quite simply, slaves can escape to liberty, horses cannot. By constructing her narrative in the way that she has, Sewell has raised an issue which her book cannot satisfactorily resolve. If, that is, the plight of horses under human domination is analogous to that of black slaves under white masters, then, by extension, it is as wrong to deprive horses of liberty as it is to deny freedom to slaves. And indeed, for all the complacent assumption that horses are natural servants, Sewell's text is intermittently troubled precisely by the imnaturalness of their servitude. In chapter six, entitled "Lib erty," for example, Beauty muses, as might any slave on a comfortable, well-run planta tion: What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year</page><page sequence="5">Black Beauty and the Pressures of Indebtedness 245 after year, I must stand up in the stable night and day except when I am wanted_[S] traps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complain ing, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say ... it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. (20) Again, in chapter thirty-seven, Beauty is driven out into the country by a benevolent and virtuous master, the cabman Jerry, and is left for a few hours in a meadow as a "rare treat": When my harness was taken off, I did not know what I should do first ? whether to eat the grass, or roll over on my back, or lie down and rest, or have a gallop across the meadow out of sheer spirits at being free; and I did all by turns. (143) This nostalgia for liberty, even in a creature as tractable as Black Beauty, conflicts sharply with Sewell's pervasive assumptions about the appropriateness, the rightness even, of equine service, and that conflict derives, I would suggest, from a more general ambiva lence in the way in which horses are represented in nineteenth-century culture. Harriet Ritvo, as I remarked at the beginning of this article, has discussed admirably the ideologi cal construction of the horse as a providentially designed and assigned aid to human enterprise, but this version of equine status runs in awkward tandem with an alternative tradition which her account fails to recognize. For in Romantic iconography the horse is at least as often the embodiment of untamed natural force as it is representative of subordination to human purpose. Such images of elemental power are perhaps most commonly encountered in the visual arts ? one thinks, for example, of the wild or riderless horses of Delacroix and G?ricault, or of the successive versions of George Stubbs's A Lion Attacking a Horse (Fig. 4) ? but they are also frequent in early nine teenth-century poetry.4 When Marmion has received his fatal wound at Flodden in Scott's poem, for example, his warhorse rushes past Eustace and Clara fast as shaft can fly, Bloodshot his eyes, his nostrils spread, The loose rein dangling from his head (Marmion 6.27.38-40) and when Cythna rescues Laon from battle in The Revolt of Islam, Shelley describes how, "with reinless speed" A black Tartarian horse of giant frame Comes trampling over the dead, the living bleed Beneath the hooves of that tremendous steed. (6.19.2499-2501) Even more dramatically, Byron's Mazeppa is bound to a "noble steed/Who look'd as though the speed of thought/Were in his limbs": 'Twas but a day he had been caught; And snorting, with erected mane, And struggling fiercely, but in vain, In the full foam of wrath and dread To me the desert-born was led. (Mazeppa 9.8-12)</page><page sequence="6">K) ON O H O ??H 2 H &gt; H C tfl &gt; o o c r H G Figure 4. George Stubbs, A Lion Attacking a Horse, c. 1762. Courtesy of the Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection, New Haven.</page><page sequence="7">Black Beauty and the Pressures of Indebtedness 247 In their nightmare career across the steppes, they encounter a "trampling troop" of wild horses: With flowing tail, and flying mane, Wide nostrils never stretch'd by pain, Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein, And feet that iron never shod, And flanks unscarr'd by spur or rod, A thousand horse, the wild, the free, Like waves that follow o'er the sea, Came thickly thundering on. (17.27-34) As Burke observed of the warhorse in Job, in such descriptions "the useful character of the horse entirely disappears, and the terrible and sublime blaze out together" (66). It is, I would suggest, a residuum of this Romantic apotheosis of the horse as incarnation of natural energy which very largely determines Anna Sewell's insistence on lost liberty in Black Beauty and which may well have contributed to her decision to structure her narrative as an equine counterpart to Uncle Tom's Cabin. But, whereas in Stowe's book a system that suppresses human freedom can be unequivocally condemned, in Sewell's a lament over slavery has to co-exist uneasily with an assertion not only of slavery's eco nomic necessity but of its moral justification. The subjection of horses to the whim of their human owners is thus simultaneously deplored as an injustice and celebrated as a natural bond; Romantic and utilitarian versions of the same animal threaten to collide as irrecon cilably as they do in the first chapter of Hard Times. In any event, however, Sewell is able to sidestep this potential aporia by displacing her book's focus from a systemic to a local grievance, by directing her outrage not at the institution of equine slavery as a whole but at a specific and remediable abuse within it. Her book, as most commentators acknowledge, was extremely influential in bringing about the eventual disappearance of the bearing-rein in Britain and America. This device consisted, essentially, of a short strap connecting the bit to a fixed ring on the horse's back harness, and its purpose was to hold the animal's head in a rigidly erect position (Fig. 5). Apart from a continual strain on the neck muscles, this meant that "going uphill, the horse was unable to lower its head for greater purchase; going downhill, it suffered restricted vision and had difficulty in recovering from a false step" (Turner 156). The bearing-rein seems to have become popular in the opening decades of the nineteenth century, and its widespread use had no other real purpose than to give carriage-horses what was regarded as a showy appearance; this was augmented if, when the wretched animals tried to toss their heads to relieve the pressure, they scattered flecks of (often bloody) foam about ? a sign, it was felt, of spiritedness and a reminder of the natural energies which had been subdued to human control. The discussion of this peculiarly vile device forms a recurrent motif in Black Beauty. The subject is first introduced by Ginger in chapter eight as a source of especial grievance: "you . . . don't know what it is, but I can tell you it is dreadful" (26). Bearing-reins, however, are almost unknown in the vicinity of Birtwick because "the Squire and Farmer Grey had worked together,... for more than twenty years" to get them done away with (39; ch. 11), and the novel chronicles an incident in which Squire Gordon tries to dissuade</page><page sequence="8">248 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE COMFORT TORTURE. Figure 5. "Torture" and "Comfort," from Edward Fordham Flower, A Few Words About Bearing Reins (London, 1875). one Captain Langley from "worrying your horses and lessening their power" (41; ch. 11). Beauty himself, therefore, first experiences the full horror of the bearing-rein when he and Ginger join Lord W-'s establishment at Earlshall Park and Lady W- insists that their reins be daily shortened until the torment becomes intolerable and Ginger rebels. It is not, however, only the upper classes who employ this instrument of torture, as Beauty later discovers when he is driven by a carter named Jakes. The use of the bearing-rein inhibits him from drawing heavy loads uphill and he is being subjected to an unjust flogging one day when a passing "lady" explains to Jakes that "he cannot use all his power with his head held back as it is" (176; ch. 46). Sewell, of course, had a range of objectives in Black Beauty, but the bearing-rein is certainly the most prominent of her targets for reform and the book was written very largely with the specific purpose of furthering its elimination. Nor was Sewell alone in her campaign. As early as the 1840s an author signing himself "Philippos" had produced a pamphlet entitled Horse-Emancipation; or, The Abolition of the Bearing-Rein, but the controversy became acute in the 1870s when, for example, Angela Burdett-Coutts de nounced bearing-reins in a speech at Torquay and Edward Fordham Flower, a Stratford brewer and indefatigable writer of letters to newspapers, became a passionate champion of the downtrodden horse, exclaiming in a frequently reprinted leaflet: "I shall persevere,</page><page sequence="9">Black Beauty and the Pressures of Indebtedness 249 and though I am old, I do not despair of living long enough to have it engraved on my tombstone, 'He was one of the men who caused the bearing-rein to be abolished'"(6). Both the fervor and the language of "Philippos" and Flower, with their talk of emancipa tion and abolition, suggest a conscious self-alignment with the opposition to slavery, and that suspicion is confirmed when Flower describes horses in a letter to the Daily News as "dumb slaves" (14) and elsewhere pities the horse as the "much abused friend and slave of man" (12). "Philippos," though earlier in date, is yet more explicit. Responding to the argument that a horse, once accustomed to the bearing-rein will miss it if its use is discontinued, he fulminates: "Miss it"! Aye, and with about as much regret, as the emancipated convict misses his knocked off fetters, as the freed negro misses the lash of the cart-whip; or as the African female misses the application, to her bosom, of the once-used burning brand! Out upon such Bedlam arguments! (13) In the light of such rhetoric from her fellow-campaigners, Sewell's decision to model her narrative on Uncle Tom's Cabin seems natural enough. But that decision, as we have seen, entails difficulties when the momentum of intertextuality comes close to compelling Sewell into a radical questioning of the use of horses by human owners. She, and for that matter, "Philippos" and Flower, seek only to emancipate the horse from a specific griev ance within a generally acceptable system, and this necessitates an insistent foregrounding of the bearing-rein as an anomaly; once that anomaly has been dealt with, the system of equine slavery by implication can revert to legitimacy. In this respect, at least, Black Beauty might be viewed less as analogous to other examples of juvenile or tract literature than to those contemporary "problem" or "thesis" novels which center their narratives on the exposure of particular abuses in a society whose need can thus appear to be for limited, piecemeal reform rather than for radical transfor mation, and which confine themselves, in Charles Reade's words, to "a few undeniable truths out of many" (504). Of Reade's own novels, for example, Foul Play (1868) is quite specifically intended to draw public attention to the widespread practice of scuttling ships in order to defraud insurance companies; Hard Cash (1863) is designed to stimulate inquiry into the dangerous ease with which people might find themselves confined to lunatic asylums; and A Woman-Hater, which appeared in the same year as Black Beauty, cam paigns for the rights of women seeking medical qualifications. Wilkie Collins, similarly, wrote Man and Wife (1870) largely in order to deplore the iniquity of Irish and Scottish marriage laws, while Heart and Science (1883) is really little more than a sustained attack on vivisection. It might, I think, be plausibly argued that such novels tend to occlude the general and systemic injustices which their sensational narratives threaten to expose by deflecting attention towards single issues and local causes, by suppressing intractable prob lems in favor of soluble ones. And that, I have been arguing, is also the strategy which Sewell has been compelled to adopt by the pressure of her indebtedness to Stowe's antece dent and more uncomfortably radical text. For whereas Stowe, brushing aside arguments for the economic desirability of slavery, forthrightly condemns a whole culture for its evasions and corruption, Sewell can condemn only the bearing-rein and is forced to repre sent the overwhelmingly numerous instances of cruelty and abuse which her book chron icles as so many individual lapses from grace, personal rather than cultural in origin.</page><page sequence="10">250 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE In 1890, a philanthropist named George Angel?, founder of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of the Band of Mercy, and of the magazine Our Dumb Animals, published the first American edition of Black Beauty; within two years of publication, a million copies had been circulated and many of these were distributed freely to cabdrivers and stablemen. The cover of this slightly emended American text bore the title Black Beauty: his Grooms and Companions. By A. Sewell. The Uncle Tom's Cabin of the Horse, and Angel? himself explained that he had been urging American writers for many years to do for horses what Mrs. Stowe had done for slaves (Chitty 223-25).5 It is extremely doubtful whether Angel? realized quite how fully the relationship between the two books might be pursued, but it is doubtful too whether he recognized quite how misleading it finally is. Stowe's novel, after all, is premised on the absolute moral impera tive for slavery's abolition; Black Beauty, conversely, derives from an inflexible assump tion that the subjection and exploitation of horses must, indeed should, be perpetuated. Uncle Tom's Cabin, to misappropriate one of Blake's infernal proverbs, is a tyger of wrath; Black Beauty is only a horse of instruction. University of New England, New South Wales NOTES 1. Chitty notes a resemblance between Black Beauty and a book by Sewell's mother entitled Patience Hart's First Experiences in Service (1862), in which Mary Sewell uses the fictional autobiography of a virtuous kitchen-maid to disseminate her characteristically strong views about the proper management of servants (Chitty 206-07). As Chitty points out, Patience's fellow-maid, Honor Green, suffers precisely the same kind of descent through the social scale as Beauty was to do fifteen years later, losing her position through no fault of her own, sinking to the level of general servant in a boarding-house, sustaining serious injury in the course of duty, and being rescued from hospital and poverty by a kindly old nurse, through whom she finally attains a good, secure situation. 2. Hollindale has written about the treatment of horses as machines in his introduction to the World's Classics edition (xiii-xvi). Such analogies, however, are far from unconscious in nineteenth-century discourse: J. G. Wood, for example, introduces his book Horse and Man (1885) with the bald statement that "Throughout the work I draw a parallel between the horse and the steam-engine, and try to show that those who have the management of the former or the latter will be adapted to their task in proportion to their knowledge" (xvi). 3. The sexual ambiguities of Ginger's experience, and parallels between the language of Black Beauty and that of sado-masochistic pornography, are discussed by Padel and by Lansbury in The Old Brown Dog (96-111). 4. For an excellent discussion of the horse in English Romantic art, see Taylor 43-51. 5. Uncle Tom's Cabin appears to have been a yardstick for effective reformist fiction through out the latter part of the nineteenth century: W. T. Stead, for example, writing to Josephine Butler in 1876 on prostitution, remarked that the subject "wanted its Uncle Tom's Cabin" and asked "Who was to be its Mrs. Stowe?" (qtd. in Walkowitz 96).
