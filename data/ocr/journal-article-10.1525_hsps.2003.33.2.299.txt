<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ARNE SCHIRRMACHER * Experimenting theory: The proofs of Kirchhoff’s radiation law before and after Planck [My] remarks will show...that previous efforts at theoretical proof have not been on the right track at all, and also how little even in the simplest special cases they have been capable of making Kirchhoff’s first law plausible.1 AMONG THE LAWS of physics established in the 19th century two were particu- larly outstanding and celebrated: Ohm’s law of electrical conduction (1827) and Kirchhoff’s law of the emission and absorption of radiation (1859). Both laws take the same mathematical form. The ratio of potential difference U and current I is a characteristic resistance R, or, U/I=R , as is the ratio of the emissive power e and the absorptive power a for fixed temperature and wavelength according to the expression e/a=f.  2  Both laws are notable for their simplicity and generality. None- theless, an essential difference separates them. Ohm’s law implies that each conductor has a distinctive resistance.  Kirchhoff’s law, on the other hand, has to do with universal quantities: “for rays of the same wavelength at the same temperature the ratio of emissive power and absorptive power is the same for all bodies.” An equivalent and more common formulation states that the ratio of e to a “is a  universal function of wavelength and tempera- ture only.”3  In modern notation, e/a=f (T, l). This universal function f acquired utmost importance at the end of the 19th century, as it described the unique emission spectrum for all “black bodies,” bod- *Munich Center for the History of Science and Technology, Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany; A.Schirrmacher@deutsches-museum.de.

The famous search for the correct  for- mula for black-body radiation and Planck’s solution to it amounted to the determi- nation of Kirchhoff’s law. A second difference between the laws of Ohm and Kirchhoff lies in the histo- ries of their justification and acceptance. Nobody in the 20th century would have demanded a new proof of Ohm’s law, but, as the epigraph to his paper, taken from a talk by David Hilbert at the 1912 Naturforscherversammlung demonstrates, even more than half a century after the establishment of Kirchhoff’s law and more than a decade after the final determination of its universal function in Planck’s formula, no consensus about its validity had been attained. Finally, Ohm stressed the mathematical nature of his proof of the law and em- phasized that theory—Fourier’s theory of heat conduction in fact—had been his constant guide.4  Kirchhoff, on the other hand, not only arrived at his law in the course of experiments on Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum, he adopted much from experimentation with mirrors, prisms, and diaphragms in his proofs of this law—as many other physicists did in later attempts. Hence, apart from a metaphorical use of the term “experimental” (when physi- cists test different and often incomplete sets of hypotheses and threads of different types of argument), experimental approaches played a direct role in the founda- tional discourse of Kirchhoff’s law in theoretical reasoning.5  I will call this phe- nomenon experimenting theory, as it concerns the role of experimental set-ups, the framing of the line of argument in experimental terms, the step-by-step procedures of varied situations, and, in particular, the postulating of idealized objects in thought- experiments. This paper presents an example of experimenting theory from the field of clas- sical radiation theory as a contribution to the discussion of the interplay of theory, experiment, and the use of instruments or tools (both material and conceptual) that has attracted much attention in recent years.6 und Wärme,” Akademie der Wissenschaften, Monatsberichte (Berlin, 1860), 783-787, 784, 786, reprinted in Gustav Kirchhoff, Untersuchungen über das Sonnenspektrum und das Spektrum der chemischen Elemente und weitere ergänzende Arbeiten aus den Jahren 1859- 1862 (Osnabrück, 1972), ed.

This includes the evolution of the ascribed content of the law as well as its assumed foundational roots.7  Planck’s search for the correct justification of his radiation formula will be placed in the context of the debate over the derivation of Kirchhoff’s law. Furthermore, I will ask what the analysis of the variety of approaches, arguments, and ontological claims that can be found in radiation theory may reveal about the conceptual framework available for Planck’s researches. Finally, I will set forth the different forms of reasoning applied in prov- ing a physical law.  They range from procedures closely abstracted from experi- mental action like those found in Kirchhoff or Helmholtz, to a purely mathemati- cal approach (such as Hilbert’s) void of any experimental notion or object. I locate Planck’s special method in a particularly powerful middle ground, while elucidat- ing the great difficulties the establishment of a truly non-experimental theory in physics met before a new generation of quantum physicists appeared. 1. KIRCHHOFF’S LAW BEFORE PLANCK’S FORMULA Fraunhofer’s observation that specific absorption lines of the solar spectrum coincide with the main emission lines of sodium in a flame marked the beginning of many considerations of the relationship between the absorption and emission of luminous bodies. Kirchhoff, who characteristically preferred to complete a preex- isting line of research than to begin a new one, attempted a full “drawing” of the spectrum of the sun in 1859. Simultaneously, he tried to condense qualitative knowl- edge about the coincidence of emission and absorption spectra into a quantitative law that would govern spectral analysis.8  By making explicit the insight that infor- mation on the physical composition of the stars can be inferred from comparison of the spectra of the sun and the chemical elements, he (and Robert Bunsen) founded spectral analysis.  While the qualitative rule that a body can emit all the wave- lengths it absorbs applied generally to all radiating substances, the exact law— which Kirchhoff arrived at in December 1859—no longer applied to systems like salt in a flame. Rather,  it referred to situations of equilibrium in which the me- chanical theory of heat held.  This limitation gave rise to much confusion about the “Historiographische Anmerkungen zum Verhältnis von Experiment, Instrumentation und Theorie,” ibid., 13-51. 7.

Specialists in the field like Aimé Cotton and Heinrich Kayser would later write extensive reviews to determine the range of application of Kirchhoff’s law and examine its theoretical implications.9 Kirchhoff took it for granted in 1860 that the ratio of emissive power to ab- sorptive power must be the same for all bodies. The open question was whether this relation applied to each wavelength separately.10  Consideration of single wave- lengths arose for him from his researches on emission lines of colored flames and absorption lines in the solar spectrum. The necessity of a double proof Kirchhoff’s paper, “On the relation between emission and absorption of light and heat,” was presented to the Berlin Academy of Sciences on  December 15, 1859.11  Originating from his observations of Fraunhofer lines, which he had pre- sented seven weeks earlier to the same audience,12  it reported a general law reached “by a very simple theoretical consideration.” Kirchhoff’s simple proof employed an idealization of the sodium colored flames he used in his experimental investi- gations: “it appears unobjectionable to postulate the existence of a body that, of all heat radiations, the luminous as well as the dark, emits only rays of one wave- length and absorbs only rays of the same wavelength.”13 The proof involved two infinitely extended plates facing one another (figure 1) one of them, C, with the postulated properties for a wavelength L, the other, c, of arbitrary emissive and absorptive qualities. The back sides of the facing plates had perfect mirrors in order to retain all radiation between them (R and r). Light of the particular wavelength L therefore bounces between the plates, suffering partial absorption and partial reflection each time. Kirchhoff claimed that by summing the successively absorbed and reflected energies and using the condition of final equilibrium he could demonstrate the validity of his law.  Then, imagining the second plate c replaced by an arbitrary plate c’  at the same temperature, he con- cluded that the relation must be universal, the same for all bodies.  Since according to the calculation the ratio e/a  must equal for any plate c, c’  etc. that of C  (for 9.

He added that his argument secured the theoretical foundation of the method he had proposed for the chemical analysis of the solar atmosphere.14 Only a few weeks later, Kirchhoff apparently changed his view that a general proof could be attained by the simple theoretical considerations he had invoked. In January 1860, he submitted a second much more involved proof without initially commenting on the fate of the first one. Two years later, he published a structurally improved version of this second derivation, which his editors chose for his col- lected works.15  In this revision, he commented on the supposition of bodies that perform only at one specific wavelength:16  “The necessary completion of the proof may easily be given when a plate is supposed to exist, having the property of 14. Ibid., 786f. Kirchhoff did not recognize that his law, which supposed thermal equilib- rium, could hardly be used for non-equilibrium phenomena like burning gases.

Instead, he relied on an even more intricate ob- ject: “[A] plate is possible which, of the rays striking it at the same angle, transmits and reflects them in different degrees according to their wave length and plane of polarization. A plate, which is so thin that the colors of thin films are visible and which is placed obliquely in the path, shows this.”17 Was the case for this second theoretical object any better than that for the first? In 1860 Kirchhoff stressed that his second proof rested on the assumption of the existence of completely black bodies. The crucial assumption, however, was not the black body, but the diathermanous plate that was mentioned rather in passing. It “shows the colors of thin plates in visible radiation and,  partly owing to its small thickness, partly owing to its material composition, neither emits nor absorbs a recognizable amount of radiation.”18 The perfectly diathermanous plate was conceived to be fully transparent to heat waves and so thin—on the order of a wavelength—as to show the colors of the thin plates. Then it reflects radiation in accordance with the wavelength.  But this object had no better justification than the original one-wavelength plate.  Two years later, Kirchhoff introduced all his three assumptions—black bodies (the “es- sential aid” in the proof), completely diathermanous bodies, and perfect mirrors— right from the outset.19 Kirchhoff was soon subject to harsh criticism for both proofs.20   In 1863, Frédéric de la Provostaye, and forty years later, Ernst Pringsheim (who held that “Kirchhoff’s derivation is without any flaw”), doubted the admissibility of com- pletely black, completely reflecting, and completely diathermanous substances.21 In 1864 Wilhelm Wien demonstrated that one-wavelength plates would violate the second law of thermodynamics, the very starting point of Kirchhoff’s consider- ations.22  The French physicistA imé Cotton, in his review of the status of Kirchhoff’s 17.

Apparently referring to Kirchhoff’s second proof, Wien concluded </page> <page sequence="7"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 305 law in 1899, concluded that the first proof, “which is too frequently reproduced in the classic works of the present day, does not establish the law rigorously,”  but he accepted the second proof since the “imaginary bodies [it assumed] may be real- ized with a higher and higher degree of approximation, and this renders their use legitimate.”23  The spectroscopist Heinrich Kayser shared this view for some of the “imaginary bodies” Kirchhoff had employed, but not for all.  He could not accept the second proof.24  Finally, in 1909, Wien,who himself had proposed a formula for the function Kirchhoff tried to establish, judged Kirchhoff’s second proof to be “extremely artificial and onerous.”25  Only Woldemar Voigt called the proof “ad- mirable.”26  Balfour Steward’s dictum—“the proof of the Heidelberg Professor is so very elaborate that I fear it has found few readers”—turned out wrong in the long run.27 The second proof models itself even more on experimentation than the first, invoking an intricate setup of holes or diaphragms, completely black walls, ideal mirrors, and a perfectly diathermanous plate.  Kirchhoff diagramed the argument of the proof in three drawings (figure 2). The style of the proof may be illustrated by the following quotations:28 Now suppose the surface 2 removed, and the opening closed by a portion of a perfectly reflecting spherical surface, placed directly behind it. In the arrangement described in Figure 2 imagine a plate of the kind described and designated as P, brought between the openings 1 and 2. Let opening 2 be closed by a black surface...and let opening 3 be closed in the first place by a similar surface, and next by a perfect concave mirror.

Kirchhoff (ref. 15), 24-26. </page> <page sequence="9"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 307 The central argument demonstrating the universality of Kirchhoff’s function f follows by combining the relevant properties and laws of the objects employed, replacing the body C by a different C’ , and varying thickness of the diatherman- ous plate P. The main step is to consider the emitted energy K of the body C that is reflected by the plate P K = ò dl e(l)r2 (l), where the function r(l) describes the reflection according to the theory of thin plates and e(l)describes the emissive power of the black body C for wavelength l. In the first step, C is taken to be black, that is, a = 1.  In thermal equilibrium, K must not change when the body C is replaced by another C’  with a distribution of the energy emission over the wavelength e’ (l), i.e.  ò dl(e – e’ )r2 = 0. The conclu- sion that this relation can only be satisfied when the functions for the emissive powers e and e’  coincide, required a detailed Fourier analysis of the structure of the function r(l). In distinction to the first proof, Kirchhoff now considered both polarized ra- diation and the case that the space in which the heat radiation propagates may be filled by a diffracting medium.  With help of a law by Helmholtz, he further gener- alized the range of applicability of his law for cases with absorptive and reflecting media.29 The much greater length of the second proof, hence, had two reasons: first, the more intricate experimental argument and, second, the extension of the general theory to a wider range of applicability for radiation within material media of various kinds. Kirchhoff’s second proof was criticized in print as early as 1863 by the French physicist Frédéric de la Provostaye, who would not admit perfect mirrors or fully diathermanous bodies.30   Heinrich Kayser systematically discussed these objec- tions, among others, in his very detailed study in 1902.  He identified four ques- tionable presuppositions: First, he pointed out that, “strictly speaking, a black body cannot exist. Under given circumstances, however, any body can play this role approximately.” The assumption of the existence of completely diathermanous bodies presented much greater difficulties.  A vacuum or possibly a dilute gas might pass the diathermal test, but since it would emit nothing it would not reach thermal equilibrium.31   Perfect mirrors, which had been used in the literature since Fourier, were the least problematic abstraction. And last there was the implicit assumption that only the local physical condition would determine emission and absorption at a certain point.32 Kayser’s thorough analysis of Kirchhoff’s second 29.

Helmholtz and a prism Kayser’s analysis also mentioned a different but related treatment in Paul Drude’s book on optics from 1900.33  This new proof, however, was first given by Hermann von Helmholtz in his famous lectures of the early 1890s, which influ- enced many physicists, among them Max Planck. The relevant part of these lec- tures was not published until 1903.34 Helmholtz opened his proof (figure 3) with the requirement of thermal equi- librium and the consideration of black bodies.35   Then all black bodies at the same temperature must emit the same radiation energy. However, the partial in- tensity for a certain color might exceed that for other black bodies provided that it was less for different colors. Hence, Helmholtz proceeded,36 FIG. 3 Drawing used by Helmholtz in his proof (ref. 34), 165. 33. Paul Drude, Lehrbuch der Optik (Leipzig, 1900), 454-457. 34.

Then appropriately arranged completely reflecting diaphragms d (Fig. 23) can insure that only radiation from one side of the cover that originates at a certain surface element F can enter a prism as a straight pencil and be refracted so that a point g on the other side of the cover receives only radiation of the pencil 1  with the color f , a different point g  only that of color f . 1 2 2 Following this scenario, Helmholtz demonstrated that when the emission for the first color f1 at the point g1 was greater than that for all other black bodies, and accordingly less for the second color, the temperature at the first point would de- crease at the expense of the second. The central ingredient for this argument was the Helmholtz reciprocity theorem: for each light ray traveling a certain path, a light ray that traveled the same path but in reversed direction would undergo the same rate of absorption, reflection, diffusion, etc. as the original one.  Helmholtz then generalized his result for arbitrary bodies in a rather cursory, if not mislead- ing, manner in order to arrive at Kirchhoff’s law.37 Helmholtz’s line of argument, although very different from Kirchhoff’s, em- ployed a similar method of reasoning: an ingenious thought experiment. Like Kirchhoff, Helmholtz presupposed the existence of perfect mirrors and completely black bodies. In effect, he replaced the completely diathermanous plate by the completely transparent prism.  Kayser made short work of the Helmholtz-Drude proof by noting that complete transparency and dispersion of light simply exclude one another. Hence, once again, the idealized object and the proposed thought experiment did not exist even in principle. The 19th-century proofs of Kirchhoff’s law can be summarized as in table one. Phenomenology at stake Kirchhoff’s theoretical work, which influenced a whole generation of German and European physicists, went back to Franz Neumann, Kirchhoff’s teacher in Königsberg. Woldemar Voigt, another disciple of Neumann’s, described the gen- eral character of the school’s phenomenological approach as follows: theory “should describe the motions that occur in nature completely and in the simplest way,” making possible “rigorous conclusions on the basis of a minimum of assump- tions....Such a view is called phenomenological, which means that the foundations of the theoretical treatment are taken exclusively from direct observation.”  Voigt criticized the atomistic view of matter for its compulsion to obtain an explanation of effects at the cost of high ambiguity and arbitrariness.38   The pheno-menologist, 37. He claims that the same ratio of emissive and absorptive power “that applies to the total radiation must also apply for each single kind of radiation separately,” which would imply constancy with respect to the wavelength.

Considered “today’s greatest physicist” by Voigt, and praised for his “caution and conscientiousness” by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff was widely seen as a model scientist. In Boltzmann’s words he defined the “prototype of the German way to treat mathematical physical problems,” as Euler, Gauss, and Neumann had done previously.39  Radiation theory put phenom- enology to the test since the basic phenomenological doctrine of banning the use of special hypothetical models naturally extended to the ban of conceptual objects with idealized properties never observed in reality. Was Kirchhoff’s proof of his law, which met with so much criticism, the exception to this rule? Boltzmann did not comment on this question. Rather, he praised the beauty of Kirchhoff’s work on mathematical methods: highest precision in hypotheses, careful analysis (“feine Durchfeilung”), amplification of insights without concealing any difficulties, and specification of the slightest obscurities. He opposed Kirchhoff’s approach with Maxwell’s work on gas theory, where, by means of a miraculous substitution, “which to justify there is no time...the formulae spew out result after result, until, as a surprising final effect, the heat equilibrium of a heavy gas is obtained.”40  However, Kirchhoff’s second proof does not appear so distinct from Maxwell’s style as Boltzmann suggested.  Kirchhoff apparently did not discuss his law in his lectures on mathematical physics suggesting that his theory—although with results of eminent importance—was no exemplar of mathematical physics.41 There was at least one physicist who saw the necessity to justify the phe- nomenologists’ inclination to deal with conceptual bodies, Friedrich Pockels.  In 1903, Pockels, Kirchhoff’s former colleague at Heidelberg, commented on the form of Kirchhoff’s argumentation:  “Conceptual operations with bodies or pro- cesses that are, in reality, only approximately realizable, may appear strange at first sight; it is, however, perfectly admissible as a means of simplifying the argu- ment, for the truth of the facts to be demonstrated cannot depend on the degree of perfection of our artificial instruments.”42 Pockels observed that the Physical-Technical Imperial Institute had almost re- alized the production of these “artificial” black bodies.

If Kirchhoff was a model theoretical physicist, and his approach ex- emplary, how does his proof of his law fit into the picture? In what sense did Kirchhoff’s “subtle way” of deriving his law independently of any material prop- erties later became “the methodological model for the investigations of Planck and Einstein”?43 Planck, who edited the publication of Kirchhoff’s works on emission and ab- sorption for Ostwald’s Klassiker in 1898 did not mention any of the general objec- tions discussed above.44  Again, in 1906, when he presented his proof of the law, he did not indicate whether, if at all, his treatment was influenced by Kirchhoff. Three years later, Wien justified disregarding Kirchhoff’s approach: “Today, it is hardly necessary to follow Kirchhoff’s original proofs if the definitions and starting point are chosen slightly differently.” 45 Further analysis around 1900 Friedrich Richarz, who edited Helmholtz’ lectures on the theory of heat, pointed out that he could save Helmholtz’ proof by a simple modification, and thus would remain within the framework of the thought-experiment.  Richarz reminded his readers that in his lectures, Helmholtz had mentioned the possibility of using a line grating instead of a prism in the critical steps.  By using a grating, the contradiction in the properties assumed for the prism could be avoided. Richarz concluded that Helmholtz’ “simplification” of Kirchhoff’s proof was still “thoroughly flawless.”46 Ernst Pringsheim provided the simple new proof in 1901. It required a retrac- tion from Richarz:  “Even in this way, the proof can still not be given in a manner free from objection, a fact to which my friend E. Pringsheim drew my attention; unless consideration is restricted to mutual irradiations of parts of the surface of the body, as Helmholtz did in his lectures.”  Since “an essential advance” in recent radiation theory was to treat “directly the radiation present in the ether, detached from the bodies that emitted it,” Helmholtz’ set-up, along with Kirchhoff’s, no longer had any value.47 A professor in Breslau, originally from the Physical-Technical Imperial Insti- tute at Berlin, Ernst Pringsheim concluded from his experimental work that Kirchhoff’s law would “not be valid for all kinds of light but only for those phe- 43.

Pringsheim had managed his flawless proof, however, by bringing in an argument that lay outside the theoretical framework in which the discussion had been conducted.  Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, and Kayser sup- posed that radiation was emitted only at the surfaces of bodies and otherwise obeyed ray optics.  Pringsheim worked with the new understanding of radiating ether or pure radiation.  Light paths restricted by diaphragms so that that radiation would come from one well-defined surface area and travel to a distinct other one, could no longer be accepted.49  Pringsheim did not need any of Krichhoff’s questionable plates: “The derivation that is given in the following does not make assumptions of this kind, but starts with the empirical fact that arbitrarily many bodies exist or are producible, respectively, whose absorptive power varies in completely differ- ent ways from wavelength to wavelength.”50   Combined with Carnot’s principle, which provided the indispensable basis of all arguments, this assumption sufficed. Pringsheim took from prior derivations the realization that, after the imple- mentation of thermal equilibrium, the next most important step lay not so much in the radiation geometry but in the replacement of one body by another with differ- ent physical properties. While Kirchhoff and Helmholtz treated the generalization of the law over all wavelengths and for all bodies in two quite separate steps, Pringsheim saw that both could be done together: The replacement changes emis- sive and absorptive properties generally (for example, being more or less black), and also the spectral variation of these properties. This fact can be exploited to deduce from the constancy of the ratio of total emission and absorption to that for each wavelength separately. Pringsheim continued with two steps which Kirchhoff had taken as well (es- tablishing the formula and exhibiting the unique radiation distribution for a black body), but in reverse order: First, he considered a body with absorptive power Al and the radiation within a cavity that contains this body, and established that, in equilibrium, a unique radiation distribution must be reached that is “quantitatively and qualitatively the same as a completely black-body would emit, if it existed.”51 In the demonstration, not the body but the cavities, or rather its walls, are replaced 48.

Assuming that the distribution of the emitted radiation energy over the wavelength l was different for different cavity materials e1l, e2l,..., enl, then, since the total absorbed energy of the body must not change,                                               ¥                ¥                                                     ¥ ò Ale1ldl = ò Ale2ldl =  ...  = ò Alenldl .            0                                   0                                                     0                                    The absorptive power Al of the body within the cavities could be an arbitrary func- tion of the wavelength unrelated to the emission of the different wall materials e 1l, e2l,..., enl.  These, in consequence, must be equal to a universal function for an ideal black body, since otherwise the integrals would not all coincide. Kirchhoff’s formula came as a second step, by considering the mutual irradia- tion of two surface elements—one of the body and one of the cavity—and assum- ing Helmholtz’ (unproven) reciprocity theorem.  Here Pringsheim set aside the new view of radiating ether.  Indeed, Pringsheim never made explicit in his publi- cations of his proof the new view on radiation he used to invalidate the Helmholtz- Richarz argument. Pringsheim’s proof agreed with Kirchhoff’s to the extent that it employed an experimental way of thinking.  Consider the style of argument:52 Placing the same body K into an arbitrary number of cavities, one after the other, that all have the same temperature but are completely different in shape and com- position of the bodies, the emission of the body K remains unchanged as does the absorptive power Al for each determinate kind of radiation. In distinction to earlier thought-experiments, Pringsheim, for the first time, pre- sents an experiment that can be performed in the laboratory, and his words can be read as an experimental observation. Only in the next step did it become clear that his statement arose from theoretical considerations. Pringsheim presented the varia- tion of the absorptive power A  of the body K not as a replacement of the actual l body, but as a consequence of the arbitrariness of the function A . l The crucial step in the mathematical parts of the argument in the proofs of Pringsheim and Kirchhoff are similar: The integrals of certain emission functions for black bodies of different material properties are combined with a set of auxil- iary functions to show that the emission functions are identical.  Kirchhoff gener- ated the set of auxiliary functions by changing the thickness of the (non-existent) diathermanous plate.  Pringsheim generated them by supposing an infinite number of substances with different functions of absorptive power.  Whereas Kirchhoff, using Fourier analysis, could claim mathematical conclusiveness but had prob- 52. Pringsheim, “Einfache” (ref. 50), 82. </page> <page sequence="17"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 315 lems with his ontology, Pringsheim had problems with both.  He did not point to a mathematical theory that insured orthogonality of his function set, or that the func- tions of existing or producible materials actually formed a complete set.  These subtle questions of functional analysis would surface later in a rigorous math- ematical analysis of the proofs. Just as the proofs of the theory differ, so did its scope. Pringsheim only consid- ered radiation in otherwise empty space, whereas Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, and later Planck worked hard to extend the theory to radiation in transparent, diffusing, and absorbing media. The determination of the generality of the law must be seen as part of its foundation. That Pringsheim did not even mention this necessity indi- cates that the role and application of the law had undergone a transformation:  The black body radiation that could be produced in cavities had become the more im- portant object of research, the relation of emission and absorption of radiation in arbitrary media now received less attention. 2. PLANCK’S PROOF OF HIS PREREQUISITE In the preface to the edition of his radiation theory in 1906, Planck observed that his treatment frequently deviated from the “customary methods” where “fac- tual or didactic reasons” suggested this, “especially in deriving Kirchhoff’s laws.” He did not say where factual reasons compelled dismissal of the older account.53 He took over twenty-five pages to derive Kirchhoff’s law.  From the outset, Planck considered the radiation within a medium and allowed absorption, reflection, re- fraction, and diffusion.  He excluded diffraction “on account of its rather compli- cated nature.” By requiring that surfaces should not have sharp edges, he used the most general case then available.54 At equilibrium, the absorbed and emitted energies of a volume element must be equal when summed over all wavelengths.  Planck’s first task was to prove equilibrium sets up for each separate wavelength as well. To do so, Planck consid- ered an (approximately) infinitely extended, homogeneous, and isotropic medium and argued that:  “The magnitudes ev, av, and Kv [the intensity of radiation of fre- quency v] are independent of position. Hence, if for any single color the absorbed was not equal to the emitted energy, there would be, everywhere in the whole medium, a continuous increase or decrease of the energy radiation of that particu- lar color at the expense of the other colors.”55   But this would be in clear contradic- tion to equilibrium. This new and very simple argument relied only on symmetry 53. Max Planck, Vorlesungen über die Theorie der Wärmestrahlung (Leipzig, 1906), v. “Hierbei bin ich öfters, wo es mir sachliche oder didaktische Gründe nahelegten, von der sonst üblichen Art der Betrachtung abgewichen.” The English edition, Theory of heat ra- diation (New York, 1959, first published 1914), xi, translates “sachliche oder didaktische Gründe” as “the matter presented or considerations regarding the form of presentation.” 54.

Planck, Theory (ref. 53), 33. principles.  Planck exploited homogeneity and isotropy of space to establish Kirchhoff’s relation for homogeneous media. Next, Planck considered two infinite media of different refraction index bor- dering one another (figure 4). After some subtle discussion of the situation at the bordering surface, which again invoked Helmholtz’ reciprocity theorem, Planck used this case to establish the independence of the ratio el / al from the material properties of the media (refraction indices). In Planck’s words, the crucial insight was that, with respect to the second medium “the ratio of emissive power to ab- sorbing power of any body is independent of the nature of the body. This ratio [in the second medium] is equal to the intensity of the pencil passing through the first medium which...does not depend on the second medium at all. The value of this ratio does, however, depend on the nature of the first medium.”56 Again, the argument applied symmetry considerations to general principles. Finally, Planck argued that one could consider “n emitting and absorbing adjacent bodies of any size and shape whatever the state of thermodynamic equilibrium” and hence decompose the space containing the radiation in increasingly general ways, to approximate any physical situation.57 What remained from the experimental thinking of Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, and Pringsheim? The last step bore at least some relation to experimental strategies. Planck’s lengthy discussion of Kirchhoff’s law for a host of cases of absorbing, 56. Ibid., 43 (English trans., 40). 57. Ibid., 39 (English trans., 37). </page> <page sequence="19"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 317 diffusing, and diathermanous media and for various media with bounding surfaces of different properties corresponded to an experimental test series.  Otherwise Planck completely did without diaphragms, lenses, mirrors, prisms, and other apparatus. Only the choice of bounding surfaces of regions of different material composition constituted the conceptualization of experiment-like set-ups. The kind of experi- mental thinking found in Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, and even Pringsheim gave way to an experimentally-motivated, stepwise treatment combined with an analysis of general principles. Planck did not raise the point Pringsheim used against Richarz; the new under- standing of radiating ether that invalidated all considerations that relied only on irradiations of surfaces. Although Planck avoided the use of surface elements, he still employed the language of ray optics in considering pencils passing through media; but since no devices were required to confine radiation of a certain kind (direction of propagation, wavelength, polarization, etc.) like diaphragms, mirrors and prisms, his considerations applied to every volume element and hence allowed each of them to emit or absorb radiation of arbitrary direction.  Planck only noted that Kirchhoff’s and Pringsheim’s proofs had not considered the cases of absorb- ing and diffusing media.58  By 1906, physicists had Planck’s authoritative book and Pringsheim’s generally accepted simple proof, which he had published in many versions.  For most physicists the business may have been settled.  Still, in the standard encyclopedia of physics, no clarity was obtained.  In his article “Theory of radiation” in 1909, Wilheim Wien’s argumentation fell beneath the level of the discussion set by Planck.  Choosing elements of Pringsheim’s reasoning, Wien first derived the law for the total radiation, which, however, is merely energy conser- vation.  He then asserted that extension of the proof for each wavelength presented no difficulty. He deployed a thin plate like Kirchhoff’s, to show that the radiation pressure (a favorite effect of Wien) would move the plate for different distribu- tions of the energy density over the wavelength, which would give rise to an inad- missible perpetuum mobile.  Wien thus revived a type of experimental thinking from the 19th century while subscribing to an odd ontological foundation:59 That Kirchhoff’s law is valid for each wavelength has its foundation in the fact that we possess instruments which can disperse radiation according to the various wavelengths present. For this reason, the radiation of each spectral region is inde- pendent of the existence of radiation from other spectral regions. Wien’s arrived peculiar view that our possession of instruments somehow ac- counts for the laws of nature can only be seen as a further indicator that radiation theory pointed to important deficiencies in the theoretical physics. In 1899, Woldemar Voigt had already implicitly identified one important prob- lem: The thermodynamic root of Kirchhoff’s law clashed with Maxwell’s electro- 58. Ibid., 43 (English trans., 40). 59. Wien (ref. 25), 282-357, on 285-287. </page> <page sequence="20"> 318 SCHIRRMACHER magnetic theory of light.60   Twelve years later, Max Born and Rudolf Ladenburg claimed that they could make this contradiction explicit in a standard discussion of the foundation of Kirchhoff’s law. Only with the additional condition of complete “disorder” of the radiation did the law become valid.61  The two men who thus brought out the borderline problem of reconciling electrodynamics with thermo- dynamics were Privatdozenten, the former working under David Hilbert’s guid- ance at Göttingen, the latter in Pringsheim’s laboratory. Planck did not address this question explicitly or discuss the relation of his proof of Kirchhoff’s law to previ- ous ones before 1906.  Only later, when his derivation was challenged, did he feel obliged to comment on Kirchhoff and Pringsheim. It was the Göttingen mathema- tician David Hilbert who forced Planck to end his silence about his predecessors. 3. ON MATHEMATICAL THINKING By the autumn of 1912, David Hilbert was widely recognized as the world’s leading mathematician. With the death of Henri Poincaré that year, he also became the most prominent mathematician concerned with the recent developments in physics.62 Hilbert had proposed to lecture at the 1912 Münster meeting of the Ger- man Association of Natural Scientists and Physicians on the application of integral equations to the kinetic theory of gases but, at the last minute, changed his topic to radiation theory. 63  He had recently realized that the foundation of radiation theory required the mathematical tool of integral equations.  He thought that radiation 60. Woldemar Voigt, “Über die Proportionalität von Emissions- und Absorptionsvermögen,” Annalen der Physik, 67 (1899), 366-387.

Boltzmann (Vienna) engaged in an extremely lively argument. We all know that nothing can raise one’s own self-esteem as much as watching accepted authorities quarrel over a question and the fight of words was received by the audience with noisy amusement. It would be correct to say that the case of stability under discussion can be maintained readily in a physical-experimental sense, while the question of ‘transcendental stability’ in </page> <page sequence="21"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 319 theory would demonstrate “the fruitfulness and clarity of the method more simply and convincingly than kinetic theory.”64 Hilbert had studied Planck’s book of 1906 together with Hermann Minkowski.65 Something of Minkowski’s approach appears from  the course on heat radiation he gave in the summer term of 1907 at Göttingen. He told the students:66 In this course I address not only physicists, but also, and even more, pure math- ematicians, who are usually more or less inclined to stay away from these fields. It is, in particular, my intention, and Professor Hilbert, too, is of similar opinion and pursues similar aims, to win over pure mathematicians to the inspirations that flow into mathematics from physics. It is not improbable that, during next year’s seminars, we will consider mathematical-physical theories, especially of heat ra- diation. This program was not executed as proposed.  Minkowski turned increasingly to relativity theory, and Hilbert lectured on continuum mechanics while continu- ing and perfecting his research on integral equations that led to a book in 1912.67 Hilbert realized early in 1912 that radiation theory might be a most telling applica- tion.68  His lecture course on the “mathematical foundations of physics” became the detailed development of these ideas.  Hilbert engaged Paul Ewald, a student of Sommerfeld’s, in March 1912 to work through the literature on the proofs of Kirchhoff’s law. He reported to Hilbert on April 11, a few days before the term started: “Concerning Kirchhoff’s law, Planck’s proof is the best known to me. Planck himself calls Pringsheim’s proof full of gaps.  Wien’s hints in his encyclo- pedia article hardly can satisfy me.”69 Ewald promised to find out about other proofs before he returned to Göttingen. With his physics assistant researching the literature, Hilbert developed his account of radiation theory and Kirchhoff’s law in his lectures. These were, in turn, worked out formally by his mathematics assistant Erich Hecke.70  Only a few days after the which not even one infinitesimal particle may acquire a finite velocity from an infinitesimal impulse, must remain undecided.” For the physicists, Hilbert’s problem was “transcenden- tal,” not something many of them would want to discuss. 64.

The joint session of the mathematics and physics sections of the association drew the largest audience of the entire meeting, some 140 persons.72  Hilbert concluded that Kirchhoff’s law on heat radiation, which had represented complex experimental results in a rela- tion as simple and persuasive as Ohm’s law, had not been made plausible, even in the most simple, special cases. For more than fifty years, physicists had failed to provide a proof for one of their most precious laws. Hilbert made clear to physicists what in his eyes was the division of labor between physics and mathematics in the establishment of Kirchhoff’s law: “This law appears here as a deep mathematical truth, whose content was found in physi- cal experiment and predicted on the basis of physical deductions, whose proof, however, has become possible only by the theory of integral equations.”73 The suggestive power or plausibility a physicist would find in the experiment- like structure of arguments like Kirchhoff’s did not cast any spell over Hilbert.  He tried to further his view on the emerging new relation between—or rather unifica- tion of—mathematics and physics by claiming: “If we did not have the theory of integral equations, the theories of gases and radiation would lead to it by neces- sity.”74  Given the asserted failure, the physicist remained surprisingly unstirred by Hilbert’s talk.  The chairman of the session, Arnold Sommerfeld, complimented the speaker for developing a framework in which everything would fit together beautifully. However, Sommerfeld added, the new approach could not produce Planck’s theory of quanta, and thus the physicists could hope that at least the new field of quantum theory remained under their command. The physicist Merian von Smoluchowski recognized the “enormous progress” that had occurred through Hilbert’s work and declared that “physicists will be grateful to him for it.” 75   But not for long. Hilbert considered radiation in an arbitrary, continuous medium with, in prin- ciple, variable values for emissive and absorptive powers, a and h, as well as for 71.

Moreover, these values could, in principle, depend on the neighborhood of the volume element considered; lack of this flexibility had been a criticism of Kirchhoff’s proof.76   To continue:77 The most important question that now arises is that of the possibility of thermal equilibrium, or of the conditions that are necessary among the three coefficients q, h, and a so that equilibrium can be established. To settle this question, we first calculate the total energy density that arises in consequence of our assumptions about emission and absorption of matter at any arbitrary position xyz. Hilbert considered in all generality the flow of radiation that arrives at a cer- tain volume element and equated it, in equilibrium, with the emission from the same volume element. Hence, the emitted energy must be equal to the sum over all paths that bring radiation emitted somewhere else and partially absorbed by the medium in its way. The resulting integral equation incorporates a certain combina- tion of the emissive and absorptive power functions and the velocity of light, with a certain symmetric kernel or propagator ( e –A / S).78                                                A           h  -     a  3⁄4    ò ò    ò      e-   3⁄4   h (x1y1z1) dx1dy1dz1 = 0                                 4pq2       S              The general theory of integral equations that Hilbert had recently put forward in his book transformed this equation into a relation for the three position-depen- dent functions q, a, and h.  It thus immediately provided Kirchhoff’s law (with position dependent on the velocity of light),                                                   q2h    3⁄4a  = const.                                        As this consideration would hold for all wavelengths and temperatures, Hilbert concluded that this combination must be a universal function of these quantities. Only four lines after his conclusion that no earlier proof had been unobjection- able, Hilbert required that exchange of energy only take place by radiation “which we will suppose to be of the same constant frequency.”79 But, having said this, 76.

Two points particularly characterize Hilbert’s approach. Planck had dismantled all the equipment of the experimenters’ workshop (the diaphragms, mirrors, prisms, plates, etc.) but still stuck to the concepts of ray optics, where single pencils cross boundaries between one region and another of different material composition. With his view that each tiny volume element could have its own absorptive, emissive, and refractive properties, Hilbert departed fully from the classical view of mutual irradiations of surfaces and provided an appropriate model for radiating ether.  Sec- ondly, Hilbert’s approach was completely free from experimental thinking. In con- trast to the experimentally influenced ways of reasoning of earlier theorists, he set up a general manifold of possible situations and solutions and then imposed condi- tions (here of light propagation and equilibrium) that provided the solution.  Math- ematical necessity played the central role, not a mechanism, nor a conceived se- quence of experimental actions. 4.  ON NOT LEARNING A LESSON:  HILBERT VERSUS PRINGSHEIM, 1912-1914 Pringsheim had published his proof several times in journals ranging from the proceedings of the German Physical Society through specialized periodicals for scientific photography and electrochemistry down to magazines directed at high- school teachers.   Kayser had given Pringsheim’s proof his blessing and Wien had made use of it.80  Between Pringsheim and Hilbert, however, a notable controversy occurred.81 Apparently Pringsheim could not grasp Hilbert’s argument as he found it in print since Hilbert’s  former student and colleague, Constantin Carathéodory, was asked to present it in the Breslau physics colloquium.  He spoke in November 1912.  Carathéodory did not succeed in conveying Hilbert’s ideas convincingly, nor did he fully understand Pringsheim’s objections. Only four weeks later, after “laborious discussions,” was he able to grasp the main point, which he promptly communicated in a long letter to Hilbert.82  The point Pringsheim raised may seem surprising, as it had nothing to do with Hilbert’s questionable assumption of equi- librium for each wavelength separately, but rather attacked a completely new as- pect, as he had done with Richarz. Pringsheim observed that the energy balance for a single volume element should include the energy exchanged via conduction as well as that exchanged by radiation.  The latter can be decomposed by wave- length, the former cannot.  Carathéodory concluded that there would still be an integral equation for this problem, but it would no longer yield Kirchhoff’s law.83 80. Kayser (ref. 9), 27, 37-38; Wien (ref. 26), 285. 81.

They agreed that Born should try to mediate between Pringsheim and Hilbert.84  Born knew both sides well.  He studied math- ematics with Hilbert and acted as his assistant in Göttingen, and had learned to do experiments with black bodies under Pringsheim.85  Born returned to Göttingen a few days after his meeting with Pringsheim.  Now, Hilbert decided to publish an extended version of his paper in the journal of the Association of German Math- ematicians.86 The extended paper contained a new section marked by a footnote referring to Pringsheim’s proof of 1903.  Carathéodory had called Hilbert’s attention to this paper and had suggested that, although much could be said against Pringsheim’s proof, the guiding idea might be useful.  Ewald, who had analyzed Pringsheim’s proof for Hilbert, might have overlooked the suggestive presentation of 1903. Although Hilbert was motivated to append some pages comparing different ap- proaches to the proof, he insisted that his specific integral equation crucially de- pended on his assumptions, and he did not refer to Pringsheim’s objection about the neglect of heat conduction. Moreover, he revealed that the correct integral equation would be at stake in the same way whether equilibrium held for each wavelength separately or only for the total energy. Carathéodory judged that the amended paper fully clarified the situation and “must satisfy every physicist.”  It did not satisfy Pringsheim.87 Pringsheim’s rebuttal appeared in Physikalische Zeitschrift in April 1913.88 Hilbert’s claim that his was the only reasonable proof of Kirchhoff’s law had irked Pringsheim. Only in the amended version published in the journal of the German Association of Mathematicians, did Hilbert point out that his discussion was meant to be an axiomatic treatment. Later, Hilbert claimed that the presentation in his Münster talk foreshadowed a proof that “satisfies the modern [neueren] require- ments of axiomatic treatment after the model of geometry.”89  In this axiomatic way, Hilbert now made clear the difference between the approaches of Pringsheim, Planck, and himself.  According to him, his main axiom was the requirement of separate equilibrium for each color, Planck’s was the local determination of the since Hilbert had explicitly required that there was no heat conduction.

Hilbert demonstrated that his axiom I would suffice to derive the law, in its widest sense, applying to radiation in arbitrary media, whereas both Planck’s and Pringsheim’s, which he called axiom II and axiom III, respec- tively, would fail. Only through the combination of their fundamental axioms II and III could the job be accomplished as well.90 In his first article criticizing Hilbert, Pringsheim raised three points.  First, he deprived Hilbert’s derivation of its generality:91 [It] derives an equation that coincides formally with Kirchhoff’s law.  However, it treats only an ideal and experimentally unrealizable limiting case, in which the whole radiation present is monochromatic.T he meaning of Kirchhoff’s law, how- ever, lies in the fact that in the only physically interesting case, which is that of mixed radiation, and which consists of oscillations of infinitely many different frequencies, Kirchhoff’s law is satisfied for each single frequency. As a consequence, Pringsheim rejected Hilbert’s claim that the law was a “deep mathematical truth” only revealed by the tool of integral equations. The ground of the rejection was experimental unfeasibility. Pringsheim next observed that Hilbert’s axioms, being far too fundamental for a physicist, could not be “tacitly assumed.” Anyway they involved a vicious circle: “Therefore the content of axiom I, which according to Mister Hilbert provides the basis of his derivation of Kirchhoff’s law, is physically equivalent to Kirchhoff’s law.”92   Here Pringsheim placed no value on the work needed to relate the two equivalent statements mathematically. Finally, Pringsheim objected that Hilbert’s axiom III, which described Pringsheim’s assumptions, did not correspond to the situation he had had in mind— the radiation of an extended body surrounded by empty space, not embedded within a medium.93  Hilbert replied to all of this that Pringsheim’s objections were “in no way justified.”94   How could they be justified?  In an axiomatic framework, all conclusions are already in the axioms, otherwise they could not be deduced logi- cally from them.  Pringsheim’s denouncement of equivalence did not count from the mathematical point of view. Second, in a mathematical calculation of a physics problem, each step need not be checked for a corresponding, physically possible situation.  Such a requirement obviously corresponds to an experimental approach, whereas the mathematical validity of an argument cannot depend on an intermedi- ate ontology as Pringsheim required. On the other hand, the main point in Kirchhoff’s law to Hilbert cannot have been the problem of spectral composition as it was initially for Kirchhoff and later 90. Hilbert (ref. 65), 19. 91.

Hilbert’s paper was received by the journal three weeks after Pringsheim’s critique. </page> <page sequence="27"> KIRCHHOFF’S RADIATION LAW BEFORE AND AFTER PLANCK 325 for Pringsheim.  Rather, the point was the validity of the relation for arbitrary media with varying physical properties, as it had been for Kirchhoff to some ex- tent and definitely for Planck, who had solved the decomposition question in a few lines but had dedicated many pages to various arrangements of media. To an un- prejudiced reader of Planck’s book, the relation for arbitrary media appeared to be the central problem at stake.  Pringsheim realized that he stood closer to Kirchhoff than to Planck, who already shared some common ground with Hilbert:95 Following Planck’s lead, Mister Hilbert considers the radiation within an absorb- ing substance and talks about the absorption coefficient as a function of the space coordinates.  I, however, following Kirchhoff, treat the radiation in empty space and consider the absorbing power of an extended body. Hilbert’s brief footnote with its wholesale repudiation of his criticism prompted Pringsheim to reply with polemics and half-truths. He complained that Hilbert turned to the axiomatic point of view only after Carathéodory had communicated to him that “his alleged derivation of Kirchhoff’s law tacitly assumed its essential physical content.”96  The complaint would scarcely have impressed anyone famil- iar with Hilbert’s work, however, since he had long advocated the axiomization of physics.97 Pringsheim turned to the applicability of the axiomatic method to phys- ics.  Reiterating that Hilbert’s derivation rested on a very special condition (single wavelength), he concluded that “strictly speaking, even all five of Hilbert’s axi- oms together are not sufficient for deriving Kirchhoff’s law generally.”  Further- more, if Hilbert put everything he needed into axioms, one would have far too many of them.  That brought Pringsheim to an axiom of his own: “We always will arrive at this difficulty when we try to found a physical discipline axiomatically.” And to an obvious inference:  “Physics is no appropriate field for the axiomatic method.”  Pringsheim did not find criticizing Hilbert pleasant.  But it had to be done to protect physicists from accepting Hilbert’s errors as truth on the basis of his high standing in “the mathematical world.”98 5. ON LEARNING A LESSON: HILBERT AND PLANCK, 1912-13 The shortcoming of Hilbert’s treatment could have been cured easily by Planck’s concise argument that in an isotropic medium, including vacuum, one wavelength must not take precedence at the expense of another.  (For Pringsheim’s under- standing of Kirchhoff’s law this was already a proof.)  But it was exactly this 95. Pringsheim (ref. 88), 590. 96.

It started a few days after the meeting of 1912 when Hilbert sent Planck a reprint of the paper underlying his talk. Planck answered in October that because the production of the second edition of his book on the theory of heat radiation was too far advanced, he could not take this “interesting method” into consideration.100  Also in October 1912 and again in January 1913, Planck touched on radiation problems.  Hilbert had criticized Max Abraham’s treatment of black body radiation in his textbook on Electromagnetic theory of radiation (1905, 1908).  Planck defended Abraham, who had been his student.  But the point raised was not a central one in the proof of Kirchhoff’s law.101 Hilbert’s criticism rested on an argument typical of his mathematical style: he constructed a solution for a, h, and q that satisfied Planck’s axiom but did not obey Kirchhoff’s law.102   This approach, however, did not determine wherein lay the gap in Planck’s reasoning; Hilbert could only conjecture that Planck’s argu- ment might not apply in the general case of inhomogeneous medium or bordering homogeneous media.103   In turn, Planck maintained that it was possible “to pro- ceed step-by-step to the general case of arbitrarily connected homogeneous me- dia” without recourse to Pringsheim’s assumptions, i.e., axiom III. The laws of reflection and refraction would suffice.  Turning to Hilbert he wrote:104 I see the sole physical significance of your method of proof in its application to inhomogeneous media. But, on the other hand, the propagation of energy in such media is not determined by the principle of fastest arrival that you use, since determinate light paths do not exist, but rather “diffusion” of light occurs, which neither you nor Pringsheim take into account. I would be very pleased if you could tell me your thoughts on these points. For 99. Hilbert (ref. 65), 18. 100. Planck to Hilbert, 4 Oct 1912, HP, 308A, item 1. 101.

A few days later Planck repeated his criticism in much detail. First he turned the tables on Hilbert:105 In your “proof of impossibility” I see a gap in the fact that your equation (26) does not begin to contain the content of my axioms.  The essential ones are the following: 1.  In an arbitrarily limited body with finite absorptive and emissive powers for each temperature a single state of thermal equilibrium is possible (maximum of entropy and minimum of free energy, respectively). 2.  h, a, and q depend only on the nature of the matter (your axiom II.) The main point Hilbert missed was the first axiom, which determined the radiation for each wavelength: in equilibrium, every characteristic quantity, and notably the radiation density, is determined by the temperature.  Hilbert accepted the validity of Planck’s treatment, which now succeeded through temporarily agree- ing on the use of Hilbert’s style of reasoning.106 Hilbert later evaluated the contribution he believed he had made to radiation theory:  “One of the most noteworthy results of my first communication lies in the fact that the statement, the ratio q2h /a  has the same value for each point of a system in thermal equilibrium, can be inferred from an integral equation, without performing any translocation of matter or change of its physical nature in the proof, which is otherwise always done proving Kirchhoff’s law.”107  Hilbert un- derstood that his style of reasoning was completely free from the physicists’ ex- perimental thinking, which, for him, was a major advance.  The prospect of a new mathematical physics shimmered on the horizon. The debate over the proof of Kirchhoff’s law provides a good example of how the mathematization of physics developed and how it came to a temporary halt. Hilbert may have succeeded methodologically by making Planck argue axiomati- cally, because only in that way could discrepancies in the various proofs be made obvious. However, physicists still did not embrace axiomatics; even Planck re- jected the approach as “inappropriate for the foundation of a proof of Kirchhoff’s law.”  Hilbert’s set of axioms was “completely arbitrary.”  Pringsheim’s assump- tion of the existence of a continuous sequence of materials with respect to certain physical properties was “strictly speaking clearly wrong.” Nonetheless, and to Hilbert’s astonishment, Planck added that Pringsheim’s proof was still the “sim- plest and most transparent.” Furthermore, it was also “factually the most pro- found,” since it derived the law from its real root—the second law of thermody- namics.  And Planck’s statement that he followed the lead of Kirchhoff—who 105. Planck to Hilbert, 15 Apr 1913, HP, 308A, item 5. 106. Hilbert (ref. 89), 593. 107.

In his third communication on the foundation of radiation theory, Hilbert came to grips with Pringsheim’s criticism concerning intrinsic reflection.  Hilbert had asked Wilhelm Behrens to tackle this problem as his habilitation thesis.108   Hilbert could now present “under rigorous consideration of reflection” new and elemen- tary proofs of Kirchhoff’s law, while also solving the question (“of equal impor- tance”) of the freedom from contradictions of the axioms themselves and in com- bination with the laws of optics.109  While the axioms remained basically the same (characterizing his, Planck’s and Pringsheim’s approaches), the proof now em- ployed a different strategy.110  The central integral equation no longer played a major role. While the proof of Kirchhoff’s law in Hilbert’s third communication followed his characteristically purely mathematical reasoning, the demonstration of the axi- oms’ freedom from contradictions required something new. For example, in dis- cussing the compatibility of the axioms with the elementary laws of optics, Hilbert now invoked thought experiments (figure 5):111 Now we imagine that the plane e and the points A, A’  are fixed...and rotate the system in such a way that....We now imagine that the space around the plane e is filled on one side with a substance with optical coefficients q, a, h, and on the other side with a substance with optical coefficients q*, a*, h*; and furthermore that a ray from O meets the plane e at A and is then refracted to B and reflected to C. Although Hilbert tried to keep the door of the experimenter’s workshop shut, with this exceptional case he obviously adopted something of Planck’s style.  In one almost ironic instance, Hilbert as much as revived Kirchhoff’s initial postulate of a one-wavelength plate: He considered as an axiom a variant of Pringsheim’s postulated existence of substances that reflect all radiation except for a single wave- length.112 What had happened to Hilbert? He had temporarily become a theoretical physi- cist. He no longer gave his courses titles like “Mathematical Foundations of Phys- ics” (summer 1912 and winter 1912/13) or “Seminar on the Axioms of Physics” 108.

Hilbert had learned that the “inspiration that flows into mathematics from physics” can only be gained by do- ing physics the physicists’ way. He came to acknowledge the legitimacy of Planck’s approach and realized the practical problems with axiomatization. Shortly after his third paper on radiation theory, Hilbert managed to pick a fight with Einstein.  He now presented “a new axiomatic system of fundamental equations of physics that are of ideal beauty and that contain...the solution of the problems of Einstein and Mie at the same time.”113 He did not, however, claim priority.  As in the discussions on radiation theory, there were more substantial issues at stake than determining priority.  Hilbert and Einstein had different aims and followed different paths in their researches.  At one point they met, however.  For Einstein this meant a major breakthrough for general relativity, for Hilbert, only a step in a program for a unified theory of matter.114   Incongruence of the objects of justification (the content of the law) and the ways of reasoning employed does not require fifty years to develop as it did in radiation theory. 113.

On the basis of Planck’s oscillator model, Einstein defined emission and absorption coef- ficients A n  and B n m m   as a measure of the probabilities of quantum transitions be- tween energy levels En and Em that had no direct equivalent in the theory of Kirchhoff’s law.115  A universal function cannot be found, since the theory of ther- mal equilibrium cannot fully be recovered in the quantum description. Thus, re- flecting on the emergence of quantum physics from a proto quantum problem, we may conclude—adopting a figure from Wittgenstein—that Einstein threw away the ladder Planck had climbed.116   But again, Einstein’s treatment of radiation phenomena employed Planck’s makeshift concept of virtual oscillators and, hence, revived a way of experimental thinking that left its mark on his theory.117 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION One does not have to search far to find fundamental physical laws that, like Kirchhoff’s, lacked full justification over comparatively long periods.  Consider the one prerequisite every proof of Kirchhoff’s law employed: the reciprocity law, usually ascribed to Helmholtz.118   But he did not prove it, and neither did Kirchhoff, Pringsheim, or Planck.  Planck even presented a generalized reciprocity theorem in 1906, also without proof,119  though one was available.  Its author, Richard Straubel, found it “strange” that both Kirchhoff and Clausius had missed this “gen- eral law of theoretical optics” or had “refrained from formulating it.”120  Hilbert took up the problem in two ways, making no appeal to physical intuition.  First, he pointed out that the theorem could be transformed easily into a problem of the theory of surfaces that had been solved by Pierre-Ossian Bonnet and Gaston Darboux.  Second, he gave a detailed, direct proof in his lectures—explicitly ad- dressing physicists.121   No doubt a closer look would reveal many more examples of this kind, for example, in elasticity theory or quantum theory. Thus it appears that physics does not generally progress from a solid home- land to vague frontiers, but rather that it reserves, or resolves in different ways at different times, questions about its general laws and principles.  What these laws and principles meant and to what phenomena they actually applied, varied from time to time. 115.

It vanished with the application of quantum theory to emission and absorption phenomena—a theory that resulted from the search for Kirchhoff’s universal function.  The later quantum theory of radiation had virtually no overlap with classical radiation theory.122  During its life cycle neither its content nor its foundational roots remained constant. The various forms are summed up in table two. The metamorphosis of the question can be seen, first, in the fact that the wave- length problem and Hilbert’s arbitrary medium problem had no overlap in content though both were called Kirchhoff’s law. Secondly, the instruments used—both the real or conceived objects and the mathematical tools—also changed so much as to cut out the common ground even among Kirchhoff and Planck. At the same time, with his renunciation of special objects and his search for a more general scope of application of the law, Planck occupies an intermediary position in the table.  Characterization of the objects, tools, and scope identifies Planck’s approach to black body radiation. The scientists involved in the story later obscured this development. For ex- ample, Max Born, who in 1913 took over Hilbert’s criticism of Planck’s proof and who still told his students ten years later that Hilbert had given the rigorous math- ematical proof of Kirchhoff’s law (although using Pringsheim’s idea), fully reha- bilitated Kirchhoff, in 1929, as the scientist who had proved “on the basis of indis- putable thermodynamic arguments that radiation released through a small hole in a glowing oven must have a spectrum of a universal kind.”  He did not comment on the matter in his autobiography, nor did Hilbert’s biographer mention it.123  Planck had already established his view in his letters to Hilbert in 1913.  In the textbooks that condensed his legendary teaching Sommerfeld essentially went back to 1859, invoking a filter transparent for one wavelength only.124 Historical research on early quantum theory tends to ignore the role of Kirchhoff’s law.125   A few biographical studies allow that Kirchhoff’s work was crucial to the development of quantum theory either as “the key to the whole ther- modynamics of radiation...the key to the new world of the quanta,” or as the “meth- odological example for Planck’s and Einstein’s investigations.”126 122.

In the first years after Planck’s derivation, textbooks still claimed other formulas would account equally well for the measurements.129   When Max Born first learned about Planck’s formula in a lecture on astrophysics by Karl Schwarzschild in 1905, he was told that Wien’s formula fit more accurately than Planck’s.130  The same situation applied to Kirchhoff’s law: The fact that high accuracy measurements suggested the independence of the energy distribution of radiation from the material properties of the experimentally approximated black bodies in the laboratory did not make a proof unnecessary.  But no valid proof of Kirchhoff’s law, which was an essential prerequisite for Planck’s theory, existed when he set up his formula.  Perhaps as a consequence of this situation, the ways of deriving the existence of the universal radiation function diverged from ways of deriving its actual expression. The process of establishing two general physical statements, one of which was needed to establish the other, was not consecutive, but had considerable temporal overlap.  The life span of Kirchhoff’s law roughly coincided with the period in which theoretical physics in Germany developed into a new discipline. Can we relate this development directly to a turn in the theoretical justification of physical laws from older types of experimental thinking to novel ways of a distinctly math- ematical kind?  The turn can be seen in Planck’s middle way between Kirchhoff’s purely experimental style of thinking and Hilbert’s purely mathematical way of reasoning.  Or, rather, it superposed elements of both, in Kirchhoff’s radiation law and in his own radiation formula. This conciliatory approach agreed well with the physics of this period. Questions about the foundations of quantum mechanics would shift matters in Hilbert’s direction. Planck was not a follower of the phenomenological school, which had roots in experimental manipulation to which he had no intimate relation. Still, he subscribed 127. Thomas S.

He did not follow Kirchhoff and Helmholtz, whom he acknowledged as authorities, in their (thought-) experimental thinking with special conceptual objects. His main pillars for the building of physics were general principles and universal constants. Physical knowledge should be independent not only of human actions, but also of experimental objects. Hence Pringsheim’s arguments in terms of experimental re- alizability, had no appeal to Planck. But he was physicist enough to work by stepwise attack of complex and complicated physical phenomena: first solve a simple para- digmatic case employing the main principles, then generalize to more complex and hence more natural or real cases. Despite his program for eliminating anthropomorphic elements from physics, Planck did not share Hilbert’s view that the task of mathematical physics was to remove all unnecessary physical ornament from discussion, to identify physical assumptions (axioms), and to transform the deduction of the law into a purely mathematical problem. This axiomatic approach, which began with the most gen- eral case and its corresponding space of possible solutions and then imposed con- straining relations, ran counter to Planck’s use of paradigmatic simple situations as starting points (the infinitely extended homogeneous medium for Kirchhoff’s law, the oscillator for his radiation function). Hilbert’s main concern was whether a set of assumptions sufficed for a logical derivation. But this ideal hardly met physicists’ needs for explanation and understanding. It is hard to say what the concept of proof outside of mathematics should mean. There is no theory of proof in physics. Nonetheless, physicists were and are much concerned with the proofs of their theories. Hence, a history of proof in physics must start with the changing divide between those insights that physicists consid- ered in need of a derivation or proof, and those that they apparently considered evident beyond question.  Such a history would exhibit the developing rationality of the science. A historical concept of the proof in physics would incorporate at the least, the following four elements. ·  Methodological assumptions that determine the conclusiveness of a proof.  This conclusiveness is different from logical implication: for ex- ample, the phenomenological ideal of simple relations between experi- mentally observable quantities, Planck’s admonition to Hilbert that hy- potheses and axioms must not be “completely arbitrary,” or Aimé Cotton’s insight that reasoning with imaginary bodies has a particular “suggestive value” that can lead to the discovery of new facts and laws. The accep- tance of certain idealizations and simplifications belongs here, too.131 ·  Types of objects, or the ontology, of the proof.  Here one might refer to the range of objects applied in derivations of Kirchhoff’s law: typical real 131.

Examples are Fourier theory, the theory of integral equations, symmetry relations and reciprocity statements. · Types of actions described in the proofs. These can be both conceived experimental actions like replacing objects, varying parameters, or com- paring temperatures at two points, as well as actions exhibited in stepwise procedures, the construction of counter-examples, or reference to math- ematical necessity. The history of proof in physics is, therefore, particularly a history of experi- menting theory.  A proper history of physics must necessarily combine experiment and theory.  There is always theory in experiment and experiment in theory. ARNE SCHIRRMACHER Experimenting theory: The proofs of Kirchhoff’s radiation law before and after Planck ABSTRACT: The role of experimental thinking and action in theorizing is investigated using an example from classical radiation theory. The history of Kirchhoff’s law exhibits both the development of the views on radiation and the evolution of the content as well as the assumed foundational roots of this law. Planck’s search for the correct justification of his radiation formula is placed into the context of the contemporary debate over his prerequisite. It is then asked what the analysis of the variety of approaches, arguments, and ontological claims that can be found in radiation theory can reveal to us concerning the conceptual framework that was available in Planck’s researches. Next, the different forms of reasoning applied in proving a physical law will be exemplified, which range from procedures that are closely abstracted from experimental action like those found with Kirchhoff or Helmholtz, to a purely mathematical approach—as that of Hilbert—which is void of any experimental notion or object. This discussion shall finally both locate Planck’s specific method and elucidate the great difficulties the establishment of a truly non-experimental, i.e., mathematical, theory in physics met before a new generation of quantum physi- cists appeared. </page> </plain_text>
