PORTUGUESE 467 Agusti Bartra's sizable production, now brought together for the first time under the competent editorship of Francesc Vallverdii, thrives upon the tension between the author's exuberant imagination and his irresistible attraction toward a few basic motifs echoing, in almost atavistic overtones, his involvement in the Spanish Civil War and subsequent exile to France, Mexico and the United States. Bartra's poetics evolves out of the inte- gration of an amazing array of stylistic de- vices, some of which point to a kinship with the members of the Generation of '27. One may detect in Bartra's poetry occasional affini- ties with Lorca's anthropomorphic paisaje, Aleixandre's surrealistic mood and tellurian imagery, Guillen's pervasive optimism, Al- berti's playful experimentalism and even Juan Ramon's esctatic trances. Vallverdu, in his enlightening introduction, also points out a few significant relationships with some Cata- lan poets, mainly, Joan Maragall, Josep Car- ner, and Carles Riba. All in all, whether these affinities are to be regarded as direct in- fluences or as mere reflections of a common background, Bartra's originality remains be- yond question: it may be said, truly, that the author, rather than imitates, assimilates and emulates. In his more felicitous moments Bartra or- chestrates all the resources of his protean ex- pression - with its daring and complex imag- ery, its overflowing lexicon, its ever changing rhythms and structures - to proclaim a su- preme paean to life which may find its re- verberations in the hearts of all his fellow men. In his earliest book, L'arbre de joe (first published in 1946), a collection of short lyri- cal pieces reflecting by and large, the catas- trophe of the Civil War, the author enter- tains the redeeming buoyancy of hope even amidst nightmarish visions of bleak desola- tion. In subsequent publications (see especial- ly L'evangeli del vent, 1956, and Quetzaleoatl, 1960), Bartra integrates his unabated lyricism into intriguing versions of the age-old myths of Ulysses and Quetzaleoatl, thus achieving works of ambitious proportions, veritable epics in their lofty tone, if not in their ex- treme paucity of action. In Marsias i Adila (1948, revised in 1971) the poet elaborates the myth of primeval man and woman; in Eece Homo (first published in Castilian in 1964) he creates a Whitmanesque universe, complete with sensualism and prophetic vi- sions, centering around the mythicized figure of the bard and the overwhelming sweep of his voice. Bartra's Obra poetica completa deserves a detailed study which will lead, hopefully, to a wider recognition of the author's impres- sive contributions to the literature of our time.
