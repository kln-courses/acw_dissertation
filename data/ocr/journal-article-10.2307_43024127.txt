<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILIP G. TERRIE Bowling Green State University River of Paradox: John McPhee's "The Encircled River" John McPhee has been writing for The New Yorker since 1964; dur- ing that time, in New Yorker columns and in nearly two score books, he has produced a canon of work prodigious in quality, quantity, and variety. His interests have included professional tennis, an elite New England board- ing school, oranges, nuclear weapons, Princeton basketball star Bill Bradley, pinball, running a good French restaurant, the Swiss army, and a host of other subjects. Reviewers have universally praised the dazzling virtuosity of his style, his facility with detail and characterization, and his ability to make the ostensibly trivial enormously interesting.1 Behind the eclecticism of McPhee's omnivorous appetite for all the fascinating features of our world and the diverse people inhabiting it lies a recurrent concern with nature. McPhee has often written about environ- mental issues and the individuals living in or working to protect nature, and he has grappled intelligently with the significance to the modern conscious- ness of understanding the natural world. Growing up in New Jersey, one of the country's most urban, congested states, McPhee started camping in the East and later developed an intense interest in the open spaces of the American West. One of his earlier books described the terrain and both wild and human populations of New Jersey's Pine Barrens. In 1971 he published a book about David Brower, former Executive Director of the Sierra Club. This was followed by a book on canoeing in Maine in 1975 and Coming Into the Country , about the people and landscape of Alaska, in 1977. Since then, while still pursuing many other topics, he has written three books on geology, largely focusing on the western mountains. In these last volumes, McPhee has undertaken nothing less than penetrating, com- prehending, and explaining the very history and meaning of the earth itself.2 Among many McPhee fans Coming Into the Country holds a special place. Several books preceding it had developed the author's abiding con- cern with the natural world, but they did not take the thematic risks or achieve the aesthetic and structural complexity of this extraordinary tour</page><page sequence="2">4 Western American Literature de force. As Edward Hoagland observed on the first pāge of the New York Times Book Review , McPhee had "published several books that were essen- tially magazine articles between book covers. But here, presumably, he made his will, took the gambit; and in so doing, he introduced a new generosity of tempo to his work, a leisurely artfulness of organization he ha[d] not had before." This book, according to Hoagland, is "a species of masterpiece." Writing in the Virginia Quarterly Review , George Core agreed that Com- ing Into the Country was McPhee's "magnum opus" and that his "con- tinuing interest in the natural world and in conservation ha[d] culminated in this brilliant book." And Ronald Weber declared in the Antioch Review that McPhee's effort to capture the meaning of the Alaskan landscape and its denizens "stands apart from his earlier work as far more ambitious and artful."3 One reason for the appeal of this book, I believe, is the persona of the author, who assumes a role quite different from that presented in his earlier (and later) work, where he seems almost obsessively committed to main- taining his invisibility.4 In the first part (out of three) of Coming Into the Country , "The Encircled River," we can see especially well how McPhee is constructing a narrative not only about nature but also about inner discovery. In no other essay or book has McPhee allowed his own character to become such a vital part of his writing. In "The Encircled River" the thematic "point" of the narrative depends absolutely on our acknowledging the crucial function of the narrator and the deepened understanding he achieves of his place in nature. This description of a canoe and kayak trip down the remote Salmon River in Alaska's Brooks Range introduces many of the issues dealt with in the remainder of the book : it celebrates the joys and hardships of life in the wilderness, the appeal of the land, and the wonders of Alaskan wildlife. Exploring the conflict between preservation and development, it looks at the struggles of native Americans as they try to coexist with modern civili- zation and survive the artificiality of American consumerism. Both the "Encircled River" and Coming Into the Country are prime examples of one of Américain literature's most interesting and enduring genres, the wilderness travel narrative. And like the best of this tradition - from Thoreau's The Maine Woods to Abbey's Desert Solitaire - "The Encircled . River" constitutes both a description of the wilderness and a tale of per- sonal growth and discovery. In its own circular way, this narrative shows the author contemplating his mortality and suggests that facing the inevitability of death, symbolized</page><page sequence="3">Philip G. Tenie 5 here by the barren-ground grizzly, leads to an increased appreciation of both wilderness and the need for its preservation. McPhee develops several major themes and motifs in "The Encircled River" ; these include the literal and symbolic significance of the grizzly, the need for preservation of the Alaskan wilderness, the difference between white and native American con- cepts of land, and - embracing all of these - the idea of the natural cycle. Despite what may at first seem a shotgun approach to these subjects, "The Encircled River" is a tightly unified inquiry into the connection between one's awareness of mortality and the implications of this for wilderness preservation. Although many of the themes introduced in "The Encircled River" appear elsewhere in the book and McPhee thus establishes continuity among his three sections, the subject of this article is McPhee's river narra- tive, which deserves to be read as a discrete and independent essay; it was published as such in both The New Yorker and The Living Wilderness .5 Book II, "What They Were Hunting For," describes the people and events associated with Alaska's search for the proper place for a new state capital; it outlines much Alaskan history and develops further the paradoxes encountered by a state involved in a modern, intensely bureaucratic nation while most of its land remains wilderness or nearly so. Book III, "Coming Into the Country," much longer than "The Encircled River" (over half the entire volume, in fact), consists of a number of loosely connected but thematically related accounts of the lives of people living in the upper Yukon Valley. Here, especially, McPhee picks up many of the themes originally introduced in "The Encircled River"; these include the personal dangers of intimacy with the wilderness and the awareness of individual mortality that wilderness demands. All of this surrounds the difficulties confronting the conservation bureaucracy in trying to effect a reasonable level of pres- ervation of the Alaskan wilderness. But while "Coming Into the Country" is entertaining, thoughtful, and beautifully written, McPhee has not attempted to invest it with the tightness that characterizes "The Encircled River." The red bandanna with which McPhee begins and ends his river narrative suggests this unity. The first sentence reads, "My bandanna is rolled on the diagonal and retains water fairly well," and the last two sen- tences return to this object, mentioned nowhere else: "My bandanna, around my head, was nearly dry. I took it off, and trailed it in the river."6 By returning to the bandanna at the very close of the essay, McPhee under-</page><page sequence="4">6 Western American Literature scores his own sense of its wholeness; the bandanna symbolizes its unity and connects the author to the wild river itself. The image of the bandanna encircling the author's head also suggests the motif of the cycle.7 The concept of the natural cycle - with its recurring patterns of life and death, plenty and scarcity - ties together all of McPhee's diverse themes, including both individual mortality and the social need for wilderness preservation. As McPhee learns - both from the naturalists accompanying him on this expedition and from personal observation and reading - the key to understanding nature is grasping the idea of the cycle. In nature everything operates in cycles. The migration patterns of the major animal species, "the bear, the fish, the caribou . . . run in long cycles over time, cycles of waxing, cycles of waning" (30) . In reporting the oddities of caribou migration, McPhee notes, Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the number of available caribou gradually declined in the Kobuk valley. Why the herd avoided the region perhaps had to do with climatic cycles and their effect on vegetation, but nobody knows. ... In the nineteen-forties, the herd began to return - in numbers that increased each year. The caribou cycle- dearth to plenty and back again - seems to close itself in sixty to a hundred years. ( 33 ) Likewise, the ups and downs in the Dall sheep population appear to be attributable to an inexplicable cycle (58). All of this is emphasized by the device of the bandanna, which, by returning the narrative to the point of its beginning, makes it a circle, endlessly doubling back on itself. ( A circle, as the verbally meticulous McPhee would be the first to insist, is not a cycle, but the notion of one suggests the other. ) The idea of the cycle dominates "The Encircled River," just as the cycles McPhee describes explain everything important about the river itself : The river flows, as it has since immemorial time, in balance with itself. The river and every rill that feeds it are in an unmodified natural state - opaque in flood, ordinarily clear, with levels that change within a closed cycle of the year and of the years. The river cycle is only one of many hundreds of cycles - biological, meteoro- logical - that coincide and blend here in the absence of intruding artifice. Past to present, present reflecting past, the cycles compose this segment of the earth. (16) These cycles (and the circles and rings that symbolize them throughout McPhee's narrative) are critical to our and the narrator's understanding of the mysteries of life, including birth and death. At one point McPhee watches a pair of courting salmon: "There is a pair of intimate salmon,</page><page sequence="5">Philip G. Tenie 7 the male circling her, circling, an endless attention of rings" (7). The deaths of individuals and the extinction of species also depend on natural cycles: "Plants and animals are living on margin, in cycles that are always vulnerable to change" ( 6 ) . The animal whose existence most interests McPhee, the animal that hovers over the narrative like a bad dream and symbolizes the almost over- whelming significance of death in nature's cycles, is the grizzly bear. The barren-ground grizzly dominates both the narrative and McPhee's consci- ousness. The key to both the wilderness and the author's attempt to face his own mortality, the bear is the first thing mentioned after the emblem- atic bandanna at the beginning of "The Encircled River" and the last thing mentioned before the final picture of the same bandanna. After McPhee sees his first bear in the wilderness, he notes, " I knew why I had come" (62 ) . The "sight of the bear stirred me like nothing else the country could contain" (62). That night, when he crawls into his sleeping bag, as soon as he closes his eyes, "there he [the bear] was, in color, on the side of the hill. This vision was indelibile .... It was a vision of the whole land" (71). But the bear is more than a rare, elusive animal whose persistence confirms the wildness of the Salmon River country. It is an all too impres- sive reminder of the author's own mortality, of his vulnerability to the dangers of travel in the wilderness. McPhee repeatedly emphasizes the threat posed by bears to travelers in its country. On the first page he observes that he takes great care not to wipe his clothes with his fingers after handling a fish: "Here among grizzly bears I would prefer to stink of humanity than of fish" ( 6 ) . A few pages later, he notes that he and his companions burn out their empty cans to remove any scent that might attract a bear (12). Like children telling ghost stories, McPhee's comrades scare each other with bear stories before going to bed (13). The most pointed of these anec- dotes seems directed right at McPhee, one of whose companions relates this tale: "Once, not long ago, a writer visiting Alaska- pitched his tent on a bear trail. A bear removed the writer from the tent, ate him, and left noth- ing much but the pencil" (13). To McPhee, the presence of the grizzly bear in the Alaska wilderness is a memento mori of huge dimensions. (This is not to say, of course, that he invents the threat. Bears do kill people.) The bear thus demands that McPhee accept, or at least openly acknowledge, the unavoidable associa- tion of death with wilderness. Such an acceptance involves moving past the ordinary fear of dying to a genuine awareness that death is a necessary part</page><page sequence="6">8 Western American Literature of life: McPhee's point (or part of it) in "The Encircled River" is that in the wilderness one is especially likely to achieve this awareness. McPhee suggests that he is moving in precisely this direction by com- paring his response to the grizzly to that of native Americans, the people whose daily life in the wilderness involves virtually constant awareness of the unavoidable fact of death. As he ponders the psychological and physical implications of the first bear he actually encounters, he recalls that "The forest Eskimos fear and revere the grizzly" (60) . The Eskimos, in addition to evincing a healthy respect for the bear, extend a spiritual, indeed a worshipful, admiration to the grizzly. This is more or less what McPhee has been doing: by dwelling on and dramatizing its ferocity, he has been making it larger than life, elevating it to mythic proportions. Later we learn that the Eskimos who hunt the grizzly tell stories about it: "The hunters had long hours of leisure, and they sat around campfires, as we do, telling tales." Further, these stories suggest the centrality of the bear in Eskimo culture: "The bear is the animal whose intelligence they respect above all others', and around which they have spun over centuries skeins of ritual and taboo. In times past, the skull of a killed bear was ceremoniously touched to the bear's heart and then placed atop a living spruce and left in the forest with its eye sockets facing north" ( 78 ) . The importance of the grizzly in Eskimo culture confirms the extent to which that culture accepts individual mortality as a necessary part of life. McPhee also notes the efforts of some whites (apparently including himself) to adopt such a stance. In the long passage outlining his thoughts upon his first bear sighting, McPhee discusses how the attitudes of certain whites have recently begun to change. This change is most clearly revealed in the decision of some whites not to carry firearms in bear habitat, "because they see the gun as an affront to the wild country of which the bear is sign and symbol" (61 ) . For "some environmentalists," notes McPhee, "fear of the bear has been exceeded by reverence" (61). This use of the words "fear" and "reverence" follows by only one page McPhee's observation that the Eskimos "fear and revere" the grizzly. It underscores his interest in the capacity of a white person to adopt a native American attitude. The degree to which this is possible has much to do with how far a person can accept the wilderness on its terms and how much that person will want to see the wilderness preserved. The most striking difference between white and Eskimo values lies in their respective systems for thinking about the land. McPhee is hardly the first to point this out, but it has special relevance to his own ideas about</page><page sequence="7">Philip G. Tenie 9 cycles, wilderness, and preservation. The issue is timely because when he took his trip on the Salmon River, the federal and state governments were trying to work out an arrangement between themselves and with the Indian and Eskimo populations settling the disposition of the huge federal holdings in Alaska. This issue - the problem of what to do with land in Alaska - pervades the account of McPhee's boat trip on the Salmon. It is raised near the beginning of the narrative: "The question now is, what is to be the fate of all this land?" (18). And it is discussed in detail toward the end ( 83-89 ) . As much as the bandanna or the image of the grizzly, this con- cern organizes and unifies the piece. As many of us now see, the relationship between native Americans and the American landscape has been quite different from that obtaining in Euro-American cultures. Europeans saw land as a commodity, something to be measured and divided, something on which human-made boundaries had meaning. To the Eskimos, on the contrary, as with many other native American cultures, the concepts of private property and legal boundaries did not have much significance. This distinction is important to McPhee because of its obvious connection to the role of natural cycles in the fortunes of Eskimos. After briefly describing the conditions of the caribou cycle, he observes, "With the rise and fall of such cycles, the people of the Kobuk from the earliest times expanded and contracted over the riverine lands. . . . In order to continue existence as they have known it, the forest Eskimos must follow where the cycles may lead" (33-34) . But this becomes impossible if the public domain in Alaska is divided into National Parks, Monuments, and Wildlife Refuges; most important, it will not be possible if the Eskimos must accept title to land of their own - no matter how big the parcel. This would involve their accepting the con- cept of private property and, worse, boundaries. Boundaries are linear and artificial, inimical to the natural cycle. "When a boundary is established around native land," asks McPhee, "what if the caribou go somewhere else?" (34) . Summing up, he declares, "The sense of private property that has been jacketed upon them is uncomfortable, incompatible with subsis- tence harvesting and its changeful cycles" ( 35 ) . But McPhee also recognizes that some sort of preservation, even though it involves boundaries and the Western concept of property, is necessary to protect the Salmon and at least a few other wild rivers like it. He devotes considerable space to discussing the conflicting demands being placed on Alaskan land by conservationists and developers. He lets the developers damn themselves in (ostensibly) their own words, mainly in</page><page sequence="8">10 Western American Literature the example of Robert Atwood, an Anchorage newspaper baron. Atwood runs through a familiar litany of the virtues of progress and the horrors of "locking up the land," something that would be "unfair to future gen- erations" (86) . After giving Atwood his say, McPhee allows his friend John Kauff- mann, an unapologetic preservationist, to supply the rebuttal: "'We need whole ecosystems, whole ranges, whole watersheds'" (88). Kauffmann correctly insists that preservation of any kind is not "locking up" the land, that minerals and other natural resources are hardly destroyed or lost through preservation. After hearing Kauffmann's arguments, McPhee offers a rare instance of an overt statement of his own thoughts: " 'This may be our last chance to suggest that we've learned anything at all'" (89). More important, McPhee acknowledges that the Eskimos are closer to Kauffmann's position than to Atwood's: "They [native Americans] saw the federal park and refuge proposals as possibly - but not necessarily - the least disturbing of the changes that could come to, for example, the Salmon River and Kobuk Valley" ( 86 ) . McPhee describes a devilish paradox: he perceives a pressing need for bureaucratic preservation of the Salmon, while he simultaneously acknowl- edges the threat of such efforts to the native culture and its symbiotic rela- tionship with natural cycles. Preservation of the river's ecosystem seems necessary even though preservation is by definition an artificial imposition on the land. That white culture is artificial is insisted on from the start, especially in McPhee's descriptions of his party's camping gear and food. Among other things, they carry "Sailor Boy Pilot Bread, peanut butter, jam, and a processed cheese that comes out of a tube - artifacts of the greater society" (21). In his account of the endless difficulties associated with "Snake Eyes," their collapsible, German-engineered kayak, and most particularly in the discussion of the intrusiveness of guns in the wilderness, McPhee continues to emphasize the artificiality and general inappropriateness of manufactured, civilized paraphernalia in the wilderness. The intrusion of civilized baggage, moreover, does not stop with artifacts. In a paragraph making further fun of the party's unappealing camp food - Instant Quaker Oatmeal, Tang, Swiss Miss, and "cold pink-icinged Pop-Tarts with rasp- berry filling" - McPhee also suggests the artificiality of the discourse of these white men, their talk of "scenic values" and "interpretation" (37). This is the jargon of the twentieth-century American preservation bureauc- racy. And McPhee implies that preservation itself is an exercise in self-</page><page sequence="9">Philip G. Tenie 11 deception - though perhaps a necessary one. Even Kauffmann, the most preservationist-minded of any of McPhee's companions, acknowledges this paradox: "'We must protect it, even if artificially,5" he admits (28). As another way of acknowledging the need for artifice, McPhee has organized "The Encircled River" with a somewhat contrived structure. The narrative opens at a point roughly in the middle of the trip; that is where McPhee first mentions his red bandanna. Then he describes the voyage from there to the Eskimo village of Kiana, whence they had begun the trip in a helicopter. Once back at the starting point, he shifts time and describes the helicopter flight itself. In one paragraph he subtly manipulates time. The paragraph (which begins on p. 40 - "Children were fishing when we were here before") starts out in the time of the trip's end; it closes with the trip's start. It also effects a change of tense. Up to here, the first half of the narrative (which describes the second half of the trip) has been writ- ten in present tense, while the second half of the narrative (which describes the first half of the trip) is in past tense. The shift from present to past tense occurs in the first sentence of this paragraph. This device helps to draw together McPhee's themes of cycles and the need for preservation. By organizing his narrative in this way, he has made the trip itself, which is literally a linear affair, into a circle, a shape without a beginning or end. By manipulating tense, he has made the trip exist in both present and past, thus making it, in effect, timeless - like the eternal cycles themselves. The title further suggests what he is up to. The river is "Encircled," that is, made into a circle by the author. It is also "Encircled" in that it is threatened - by development, progress, civilization itself - and thus, arguably, in need of protection, which will involve yet another encir- cling, in the boundaries of an officially designated wilderness area. Preser- vation is the best we can do, just as his artificial encircling of the Salmon River is ás close as a white man can come to genuine immersion in the endless cycles of the northern wilderness.8 The root of the problem is the alienation of white culture from the cycles of nature. The Eskimos in McPhee's account are inherently attuned to these cycles; their reverence for the grizzly is the best sign of this. Whites, McPhee tells us, are trying to adopt the same reverence, even though this too often seems contrived or self-conscious. McPhee returns to the efforts of whites to re-establish their kinship to nature and its cycles in the last few pages of "The Encircled River." He and his companions are discussing the risks of camping in such a remote and perilous country: "' You come to the place on its terms,'" Kauffmann observes. "'You assume the risk'"</page><page sequence="10">1 2 Western American Literature (92 ) . McPhee agrees with his friends that the dangers involved in wilder- ness travel are indeed one of the main attractions of the whole experience, that he and they are there in large part because it cannot be made "perfectly safe" ( 92 ) . McPhee ponders this obvious conclusion in terms of his own self-acknowledged fear of dying. He reminds himself that he is "an ad- vanced thousand-deaths coward with oakleaf clusters. If I wanted to I could always see disaster running with the river, dancing like a shadow, moving down the forest from tree to tree" (92 ) . This leads him to ponder the ultimate paradox of his experience in Alaska, the idea that "In its raw, convincing emphasis on the irrelevance of the visitor, [the wilderness] was forcefully, importantly repellent. It was no less strongly attractive - with a beauty of nowhere else, composed in turning circles" (93). It is precisely the fact that the wilderness, in the inevitability of its endless cycles, insists that he be aware of his own mor- tality that makes it so appealing; the wilderness forces the individual to face up to what McPhee calls the "conflagrationary imagination" (93). This form of imagination cannot be looked into for long, no more than Ishmael can long look into the fire in the try-works on the Pequod , but it must be looked into at least for a while, for doing so "augment[s] the touch of life" (93). 9 Immediately after this moment of reflection, McPhee sees the last bear described in the narrative. Both the bear's behavior and the author's reac- tion to it are profoundly different from those of the earlier sighting on the hillside. The reason for both of these differences can be found in a renewed or somehow changed power of the author's imagination. This time the bear is described as being playful ; it is fishing for a salmon, which it slings up in the air and catches a few times before becoming "bored" and walking up the edge of the river - toward the spot from which McPhee and his friends have been watching. Finally, the bear sees the men and stops: "If we were looking at something we had rarely seen before, God help him so was he." McPhee wonders whether the grizzly "was a tenth as awed as I was" (95 ) . Then the bear walks through some willows, "breaking stems to pieces" ( 95 ) , and out of sight. Except for the final mention of the bandanna, this is the last event in "The Encircled River." What has happened is a function of McPhee's imagination - a redemptive imagination (to use an expression from romantic criticism), as opposed to the "conflagrationary" imagination. While up to now the grizzly has represented only a threat to his physical safety, at this point, after pondering the meaning of the wilderness with its cycles and considering the</page><page sequence="11">Philip G. Tenie 13 implications of preserving that wilderness, McPhee is able to identify with the bear. He imagines what the bear must be thinking: declaring the bear to be "bored" is a consciously imposed anthropomorphism. He puts himself in the bear's situation and tries to think like a bear - just as the Eskimos do in their relationship with this creature of fact and myth. Significantly, McPhee chooses to emphasize the bear's "breaking the stems to pieces" as it moves through the willows: after he had seen his first bear, he and his companions had "crashed noisily" through a similar thicket, "with stems a foot apart as thick as our arms, and canopies more than twelve feet high. This was bear habitat, the sort of place bears like better than people do" (68). Thus the opportunity for identification had presented itself on the earlier occasion, but McPhee's personal fear had overcome and rejected it. Aware that he was in "bear habitat," McPhee responded to a genuine sense of the perilous predicament and not to imagi- native possibilities. On the later occasion he does the opposite. Of course, he was apparently in greater danger the first time, but now he has learned to accept more of the reality of nature. McPhee's acceptance of his place in nature is far from being unquali- fied, but neither is the notion of statutory preservation a perfect resolution of the problems facing conservationists. In dealing with wilderness and death, the modern American can resort to the imagination and effect a compromise with nature. Similarly, the larger society can opt for wilderness preservation, also an artifice but nonetheless a step in the right direction, and the ultimate expression of a collective acknowledgement of individual mortality. After this final sighting of the grizzly, McPhee begins quickly to wrap up the narrative. A different person from what he was at the begin- ning of the trip, he is conscious of having gained a new sensibility in the wilderness. He thus invokes a classic motif of nature writing and American literature in general and suggests that the canoe trip down the Salmon represents an interior journey of inner exploration leading to a new under- standing of life itself.10 1. See, for example, the review by Cullen Murphy of Coming Into the Coun- try in the New Republic , 178 (7 January 1978), p. 36: "McPhee is above all a crafts- man, the most literate of American journalists, a reporter who makes art. He writes pieces for The New Yorker that are as complex as novels, as meticulous as scholar- ship, on subjects most writers wouldn't dare." Or see R. J.

Weber, pp. 493-94, mentions the circular structure and McPhee's use of the bandanna. 8. This structural device also emphasizes the significance of McPhee's account of how he and companions reached their starting-off point on the Salmon. It enables him to place precisely at the center of the essay a lengthy disquisition on the dangers of flying in the Alaska bush, full of stories of inexperienced pilots, crashes, and the startling fact that "if you get into an airplane in Alaska, your chances of not coming back are greater by far than they would be in any other part of the country" (48). This pronouncement on the routine nature of death in Alaska is made as the trip is beginning but at the middle of the essay. 9. Weber, p. 494, calls this "a feeling of heightened life springing from the fear for life." 10. Near the end of Book III, "Coming Into the Country," McPhee returns to the bear and the need to learn to accept all its symbolic implications. Staying at a remote cabin, he is planning to walk the six miles to the Yukon the next morning - alone, down a valley where he has just seen bear scats. He is worried about meeting a grizzly. And he does not have a gun. Having acknowledged in "The Encircled River" the inappropriateness of carrying a firearm in bear country, McPhee is now faced with applying this philosophy. So he compromises : he walks out without a gun, but he wishes he had one. He takes the necessary risk; he encounters nature on its terms and not on his, but he acknowledges the psychological difficulty of comfortably</page><page sequence="13">Philip G . Tenie 15 accepting death - at least for an educated, urban man like himself. He expresses this compromise in terms of yet another Alaskan paradox. Pondering the presence of bears, he reasons, "If bears were not in the country, I would not have come. I am here, in a sense, because they survive. So I am sorry - truly rueful and perplexed - that without a means of killing them, I cannot feel at ease" (418). But immediately after this episode, McPhee suggests again that he has arrived at a new understanding. One of his acquaintances - a white man living in an Indian village - serves him a piece of grizzly bear for dinner one night; this gives "a new, unexpected, and grimly ironic turn to my evolving approach to this creature" (419). After describing the color, texture, and taste of the meat, McPhee concludes, "In strange communion, I had chewed the flag, consumed the symbol of the total wild, and, from that meal forward, if a bear should ever wish to reciprocate, it would only be what I deserve" (421 ) . Obviously, there is more than a touch of ironic humor here. But the irony itself is part of the necessary compromise, the paradox of the wilderness and how a modern consciousness relates to it. For pointing out the significance of this episode as well as for help with the entire article, I am indebted to my colleague, Professor Sue Ellen Campbell. See also Weber, p. 497.</page></plain_text>
