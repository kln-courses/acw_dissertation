<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Jordan, 2008 and 2009 Seasons DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE The 2010 edition of the "Archaeology in Jordan" newsletter presents short reports on excavations and archaeological projects in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan conducted during 2008 and 2009. Reports are organized geographically from north to south. The authors' email addresses are listed at the end of the report.* UMM QEIS/GADARA Claudia Buhrig, Orient Department, German Ar chaeological Institute, Berlin, reports: Archaeological and architectural research during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, undertaken by the Ori ent Department of the German Archaeological Insti tute, Berlin, in cooperation with the State Museums in Berlin, elucidated some new aspects of the urban transformation process of the ancient city of Gadara, present-day Umm Qeis. Investigations in the city in 2009 continued with the main focus on settlement development, intra urban spatial conditions, and water management, supplemented by the first site inspections to study the spatial relations between the city and the outer conurbation area. Gadara was founded in 200 B.C.E. as a fortification on the border between the Ptolemaic empire in the south and the Seleucid empire in the north. The site maintained its significance as an urban center in the region under various rulers of the Roman empire and late antiquity, as well as under changing population structures beyond the time of early Christianity. Only an earthquake in the middle of the eighth century C.E. disrupted the continuity of settlement in Gadara. A focus of research was a review of the construction and use phase of the theater-temple area at the east ern city access between the second century B.C.E. and eighth century C.E. After evaluating the finds, five pre liminary stages of extension were traced. Furthermore, the extension stages can be connected to the single phases in the construction of the so-called lower tunnel system. According to our interpretation, this tunnel, the terminal point of the long-distance water conduit, provided the freshwater supply to the eastern city area from at least the end of the first century B.C.E. The research thus far presents the following pic ture: while parts of the theater-temple area, namely the older sanctuary, show continuous use, the overall site was subject to constant urban-contextual change from Hellenistic to Byzantine times. Numerous indica tions in the findings, such as the alignment and large scale leveling and terracing of the theater-temple area prior to the new constructions, hint at comprehensive planning concepts. This is especially true for the ur ban structuring efforts, the changes in which can be traced from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine period. These alterations depended not only on topographi cal conditions but also on the options to use the site as sacred and multifunctional space. The topographical localization of the theater-tem ple area was the focus of the campaigns of 2008-2009. With its encircling wall, the sanctuary of Gadara was a structurally defined precinct of significant visual im pact. Terraced and placed in an exposed position, it dominated both the steep slope that leads to the Yar muk Valley as well as the skyline of the ancient city (fig. 1). Because of the arrangement of the sanctuary and settlement on different levels, an impressive scale of terraces emerged. For the visitors advancing from the west or east, the sanctuary was visible from afar. More over, the hilltop sanctuary al-Qabu is situated extra muros in the line of sight of the urban sanctuary, near the rural road to Bostra (see fig. 1). The terraced site of the presumably Late Augustan al-Qabu is situated in an exposed position as well, high above the Wadi al-'Arab. There is some evidence to suggest that both sanctuaries were connected by a processional road. * We would like to thank the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, its director general, Fawwaz al-Khraysheh, and his staff for their continued efforts and support on behalf of all those who are committed to understanding and preserv ing the cultural heritage of Jordan.

Topographical map of Gadara and the outer conurbation area, including the hilltop sanctuary of al-Qabu (C. Buhrig). The site inspections in 2009, in preparation for a sur vey planned for 2010, took place in the urban hinter land of Gadara to examine the spatial and landscape relations between both sanctuaries. During the excavations of the past few years in the theater-temple area at the eastern city access, the stra tigraphy from Hellenistic through Byzantine times was established through a considerable and well-datable corpus of finds. Empirical analyses of the pottery and marble decorations, prepared in 2008 and undertaken in 2009, were basically aimed at clarifying the origin of objects. Analyses of the decorative stone elements were meant to examine the origin of building materials in the region of the North Theater and the neighboring temple. The ornamentation of public buildings with decorative marble is virtually unstudied in the region. This sort of material played a significant role in the assessment of supraregional trading activity. Gadara is situated along an east-west supraregional transport axis that connects the Mediterranean harbors and the long-distance trade routes to the northeast (Silk Road) and the southeast (Incense Road). TALL ZIRA'A/GADARA Jutta Haser, German Protestant Institute of Archae ology, and Dieter Vieweger, Biblical Archaeological Institute, Wuppertal, report: The Gadara Region Project was initiated by Vieweger in 2001. After intensive surveys of Tall Zira'a in the Wadi al-'Arab in northern Jordan in 2001 and 2002, the excavations began in 2003. Since then, seven spring and summer campaigns have been carried out. They were conducted by the Biblical Archaeological Insti tute (BAI), Wuppertal, and the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (GPIA) and were directed by Vieweger and Haser. Excavation Area I Excavation area I is situated on the northwestern slope of the tall. Natural settings and geophysical in vestigations showed that the western slope of the hill was a promising site to rapidly expose the stratigra phy of the tall. Strata from the Early Bronze Age to the Umayyad period could be identified. By the end of the excavation in 2009, 70 squares (5 x 5 m) had</page><page sequence="3">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 507 been opened (1,750 m2 in total) in area I since the start of the project. In recent campaigns, it became clear that we must expect 16 m of cultural layers on the tall. The lowest level reached in this area to date is 5.5-6.0 m below the surface. The Step Trench The excavation trench directly on the slope was cleaned and slightly extended. The stratigraphy of the latest phase of the Late Bronze Age city wall, the two Middle Bronze Age layers with architecture, and the Early Bronze Age stratum can now be more clearly explained. The 4 m high Early Bronze Age city wall, however, has not been exposed to its base. The Northern Part of Area I The main aim of the last two campaigns was the clari fication of stratigraphy for the uppermost Late Bronze Age layer. In 2008, new squares were investigated, which provided the stratigraphy from the Umayyad pe riod to the Bronze Age without large settlement gaps. In the Late Bronze Age layer, many pits were discov ered. It is therefore not surprising that three Bronze Age cylinder seals were found in the Iron Age stratum, certainly stemming from the same Bronze Age house excavated the year before, in which 23 similar cylinder seals were discovered in one room. As was the case in the other parts of area I, architectural features of the Hellenistic period are missing. Characteristic are large pits filled with rubble or carefully made for the stor age of grain. However, Hellenistic pottery and coins show that the tall was still used in this period. Despite the disturbances caused by Roman-Byzantine pits, the architecture of the Iron Age phase could be clarified. It seems that this part of area I was covered during Iron Age II with a dense agglomerate construction of houses for habitation and handcrafts. A four-roomed house of Iron Age I date was also exposed. The architectural features and the exceptional finds in the Late Bronze Age house warranted enlarging area I a second time to the north to uncover this siz able and important building completely. Therefore, in 2009, an area of 500 m2 was opened in this section. In the uppermost layer, faint remains of the Umayy ad period could be found. Below these, the Roman Byzantine architecture was characterized by large houses, which match the plan of previously excavated remains. It seems also that these structures continue to area II. For the first time in area I, more substan tial architectural features from the Hellenistic period were revealed, including three large and carefully lined pits and some house structures; however, Hel lenistic remains are still scarce. The Iron II layer shows an intriguing concentration of 16 tabun and cooking ovens in the northernmost part of area I. Some walls were also found; however, we must wait for the results of the next excavation to form a picture of the whole architectural situation of this period. The Southern Part of Area I In 2008, the Iron II and Iron I layers were excavated in the southernmost part of area I. Two large build ings with courtyards and adjacent rooms were exposed. Two very large, round silos built of mud were also un covered. The walls of the Iron I courtyard houses used the remains of the Late Bronze Age walls as their base. Below the Iron I houses, the stone base of a large Late Bronze Age building with several rooms and an inner courtyard was revealed. It has all the characteristics of a large courtyard house. In the courtyard, a stone lined pit was found similar to a construction nearby, which is more than 2.6 m deep. Thus far, the pit has been excavated only to a depth of 0.5 m. A carefully polished stone macehead and a small figurine were recovered from the fill of the pit. The Central Part of Area I In 2009, the focus of the excavation in area I was the earlier Late Bronze Age levels. Therefore, the case mate wall of the youngest Late Bronze Age level was removed in the central section. A 2.5 m thick accumu lation of soil and stone, but no traces of older habita tion architecture or remains of another city wall, were found below the casemate wall. The accumulation was in the form of regular layers of 20-30 cm of soil and a pavement of medium-sized fieldstones. This procedure was repeated seven times. It can be assumed that the work to stabilize this large embankment was carried out over several years, as small pits and a tabun oven were found in the pavements. In the downslope direc tion, it was stabilized by a wall of fieldstones, which was also successively heightened. The reason for this building work was a major landslide (ca. 1400 B.C.E.) that had probably been caused by a rush of water or an earthquake. Signs of violent destruction (e.g., in the context of war) could not be found. Further evidence of the destruction of the slope could also be detected in three layers of Late Bronze Age buildings that were situated to the east of the city wall; the western parts of these buildings were cut away by the event (fig. 2). Since the building of the latest phase of the Late Bronze Age was constructed on the same walls as the building before it, it has to be as sumed that the rebuilding took place not long after the catastrophe and that the land had not changed hands. During the excavation, it was also discovered that the large building to the north of the casemate wall was likewise built up on top of the backfill.</page><page sequence="4">508 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 Fig. 2. Gadara/Umm Qeis. Area I, Late Bronze Age destruction levels. Excavation Area II Excavation area II is situated in the northern part of the tall. The work there started in 2006. Larger ad ministrative or cultic buildings were expected because of the high accumulation of soil and the well-protect ed situation, as the slope is vertical in this section. In the 2006 and 2007 seasons, 600 m2 were opened. In 2008, the excavation area was extended by 225 m2 to the south and to the east to understand the whole plan of a very large Byzantine building. In 2009, the area was extended again to the south, east, and west. At the end of the campaign, 1,500 m2 were open and the building plan and phasing of the latest Byzantine stratum became more evident. The uppermost stratum of area II is characterized by pits, which were filled with stones and soil. In some of them, Mamluk pottery was found. No architectural remains could be allocated to this stratum. Below this stratum, we excavated completely a house with a room measuring 4 x 4 m and an entrance to the west. An other room, adjacent to the southwest, was excavated only partly. The house was oriented northeast-south west. It was constructed inside the large courtyard of the preceding building complex and can be dated to the latest phase of the Byzantine period or an early phase of the Umayyad period. The earlier stratum is characterized by a large com plex of rooms and courtyards, which were laid out, chain-like, north to south. To the east of the chain like rooms and courtyards, a vestibule, aisle, or small street was always found. As mentioned above, a large courtyard is situated to the west of the building com plex, with a wide entrance to the south flanked by two small guardrooms. This large building was probably constructed in the Early Byzantine period. Follow ing a serious destruction event, the walls of this large building were reused where possible. In several cases, new rooms were built against older walls, keeping the orientation of the layout of the previous building complex, but not its room size. The destruction and reconstruction took place in the later phase of the Byzantine period, and the house was used with several changes until the Umayyad period. Below this large Byzantine building complex, a se ries of at least four strata with architectural remains could be excavated. They were badly disturbed by the later building activities, and it is therefore not yet pos sible to understand the complete layout of the habi tation. In general, it is obvious that the rooms were oriented northeast-southwest. Only in one case could two adjacent rooms be uncovered; they measured about 4 x 4 m. The floors were of beaten earth, and</page><page sequence="5">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 509 some tabun ovens were found. These strata could be dated to the Roman period. In the lowest stratum reached thus far, the upper most layer of stones of a 2.2 m wide east-west wall was found, and more than 25 m of its length was excavated. No adjacent walls or floors have yet been uncovered. Further excavation is needed to date the wall and to determine its function. Excavation Area III In 2007, the excavation of a third area began in the south of the tall. Large worked-stone blocks and sec tions of walls were already visible on the surface. The surface pottery could be dated to the Islamic, Byzan tine, and Roman periods. It was assumed that a large Roman-Byzantine building lay below the surface. A test trench revealed a large, very carefully built entrance with a limestone basin on the northern inner side and a mosaic floor to the east. During the summer campaign of 2008, an area of 600 m2 was opened. The excavation revealed that the wide entrance belonged to a large courtyard containing the opening of a big cistern?which was already known. This courtyard was covered with a mosaic floor and opened to the west onto a north-south aisle. Several rooms adjoined it to the south and west. The layout of the whole building of this early phase of habitation is not yet clear, as the complex extends into the unexca vated area to the north and west. Several rebuildings in later periods changed the layout completely insofar as the large rooms were divided into smaller rooms. In the northeastern part of the excavation, an olive press was found in one of the older rooms. The courtyard with the large entrance could be dated to the Roman Byzantine period. The reconstructions were carried out in the Umayyad and the Mamluk periods. The Survey in the Wadi al-Arab The summer campaign in 2009 was devoted to a sur vey in the Wadi al-'Arab, part of a three-year project within the framework of the Gadara Region Project. Very few surface investigations had been carried out in the region before. The main aim of this project is the documentation of all archaeological sites in the Wadi al-'Arab and the Wadi az-Zahar to describe and interpret their settlement distribution and history. It is important to gain an insight into the development of the region, whose center was Tall Zira'a from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age and Gadara in the Classical period. ^ouranietal. 2008. The Wadi al-'Arab is very rich in springs and offers good conditions for agriculture. Its source is located in the highlands west of Irbid and runs to the Jordan Riv er. It is also one of the most important routes between the Mediterranean coast and Damascus. In the summer of 2009, 80 archaeological sites were registered and described. The archaeological material was collected systematically and entered into a database. Thirty of the sites were previously unknown. More than 80% of the sites are of Hellenistic and/or Roman-Byzantine date. The remaining 20% can be dated to the Bronze and Iron Ages or to the Islamic period. The most important sites are the already known Tall Kenise and Tall Qaq. Two other sites should be mentioned here especially. One can be dated to the Middle Bronze Age, and the other to the Roman period. The Middle Bronze age site was known before, and there is a direct visual connec tion between this site and Tall Zira'a. From both places, the entrance to the Wadi al-'Arab could be controlled perfectly. The Roman site is located 50 m higher up the slope and was previously unknown. It has a visual connection with Gadara, which is not the case for the Middle Bronze Age site. These results give us a hint of the settlement move ments in the Wadi al-'Arab in connection with the shift of the regional center from Tall Zira'a to Gadara in the Hellenistic period. The importance of the survey is also illustrated by the major damage suffered by ar chaeological sites because of current construction and agricultural activities. In one case, a known Roman site was completely destroyed in the last two years. TELL DEIR ALLA AND REGION Gerit van der Kooij, University of Leiden, Zeidan Kafafi, Yarmouk University, and Xander Veldhuijzen, University College London, report: The archaeological project at Deir Alia and its re gion, conducted jointly by the faculties of archaeol ogy of Leiden University and Yarmouk University, in cooperation with the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, had two very fruitful years. In 2008, the final stage of the Settling the Steppe Project of Leiden University, funded by the Neth erlands Organisation for Scientific Research, was reached. Its three major subprojects were finalized and their results published in 2009. Two of the subprojects dealt with the Deir Alia region (the "Zerqa triangle") with fieldwork in 2004-2006 that included?apart from research mentioned below?work by geomorphologist Hourani1 and archaeobotanist Ellis Grootveld. The</page><page sequence="6">510 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 intensive survey and subsequent analyses by Kaptijn2 resulted in remarkable conclusions about survey meth ods and landscape use from the Chalcolithic to recent times, with special attention to agriculture and irriga tion in this steppe area. The surveys and small-scale excavations at the Iron Age sites of Tell Ammata, Tell Adliyyeh, and Tell Damiyah, with subsequent analyses by Petit,3 resulted in a clear view of largely contem poraneous cycles of occupation at these settlements during the later Iron Age. Within the same project, Wossink4 published his subproject about effects of cli mate change, focusing on the Syrian Jezireh. As a spin-off from the irrigation studies, Sufyan Al Karaimeh (a master's student at Leiden University) did a pilot survey of evidence for water management on the northern slopes of the Beni Kananah district, east-northeast of Umm Qeis. This small 2008 survey re corded water sources, rock-cut channels with branches and outlets, as well as other features. The survey pot tery collected suggests that water was intensively man aged in the region for agricultural purposes from the Hellenistic through Early Islamic times, but especially during the Roman period. Thus, the project potentially provides knowledge of economic use of this landscape by one of the decapolis towns. Fieldwork at three different sites in the Deir Alia region in 2009 included geophysical surveys using three-dimensional ground penetrating radar (GPR) and magne tome try (MG) at Tell Hammeh and field 81, as well as excavations at Tell Deir Alia and Tell Hammeh. The excavations at Tell Deir Alia were a continua tion of the 2004 season's work. The main aims con cerned the Iron IIC and III phases at the top of the tell, and the final phases of the Late Bronze Age and transition to the Iron Age at the southern slope of the site. Excavation of the complicated later Iron Age lev els between areas B and D made it possible to strati graphically connect these areas, and the studies can now be finalized for publication. A remarkable find from a refuse pit was a large ostrakon from a sausage jar with two columns of names in Aramaic from ca. 400 B.C.E. The final phases of the Late Bronze Age and the beginning phases of the Iron Age were excavated on the southern slope. This continued the work of 2004, when a large mudbrick building was partly unearthed. The second construction phase of the building, in lev els with pottery and broken clay tablets of unknown script, was destroyed by fire. It was replaced by a large building, with a different plan, also destroyed. Ex tended excavation of these last two building phases has not resulted in full exposure of the large com plexes. Surprisingly, a Chalcolithic type flint adze was found in one of the Late Bronze Age rooms. The use of the same monumental pillar base system by the two successive buildings made it clear that the later Iron Age phase is a reconstruction of the preceding burnt Bronze Age remains, suggesting some continuation of Late Bronze Age influence at the settlement. This corroborates Franken's conclusion5 for the northern quarter of the town, pushing back the beginning date of the Iron Age. Parallel to the northern edge of the site is a thick accumulation of courtyard layers, cover ing the barely eroded ruins. The courtyard layers are associated with mudbrick buildings closer to the center of the site and indicate the greatly reduced size of the Iron Age settlement. A remarkable find was a curved, narrow clay blowpipe, apparently used for melting metal in a crucible. A similar artifact was found here in 2004,6 and another in the courtyard layers above the Late Bronze Age remains in the northern area, suggesting metal processing took place in the first Iron I settlement. The excavation of Tell Hammeh was preceded by geophysical prospection for specific reasons. In previ ous seasons, a wealth of 10th-century B.C.E. evidence of iron smelting activities at this site was discovered and subsequendy studied by Veldhuijzen.7 The study at Tell Hammeh became an excellent case for understanding early iron production technology and its social con text, warranting additional fieldwork in 2009. Under the direction of Marcel Bakker, a geophysicist from TNO/Deltares Utrecht, GPR and MG prospections were carried out to create a geophysical impression of the internal structure, including slag and furnace re mains, of Tell Hammeh prior to excavation. However, because of the salinity and dense clay matrix of the soil, radar had a limited penetration (some 0.60 m) that was not sufficient to allow detection of metallurgical deposits. The MG work yielded better results, indicat ing locations with significant changes in the magnetic field, which excavation revealed to be stone walls. The same techniques were also used on a newly discovered "flat site" (field 81), 4 km southwest of Hammeh, a sus pected Early Bronze (EB) I settlement. The results are 2Kaptijn 2009. 3 Petit 2009. 4 Wossink 2009. 5Franken 1992. 6Kafafi and van der Kooij 2009. 7Veldhuijzen and Rehren 2007.</page><page sequence="7">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 511 to be tested in 2010. Excavation of the geophysically indicated spots on Tell Hammeh was supplemented by archaeologically indicated ones, with excellent results. A detailed excavation method was used where iron production remains were found, with a 0.75 m2 grid system and vertical units of 0.05 m increments. A new technique was employed to identify and process the remains related to iron working at the site. A magnet was used to scan the soil and debris to recover all of the micromagnetic materials. These will be analyzed to determine the nature of such material in the context of a smelting site vs. sites for other production phases, such as smithing.8 Among the iron production remains were a complete square-sectioned tuyere and a circular furnace feature; the furnace was dug into a platform of compact mudbrick rubble, and its approximate 0.60 m inner diameter hollow was filled with large quantities of ash, charcoal, slag, and tuyere fragments. For the first time, the base of an actual furnace was discovered, with clear indications of others. Also important is a large assemblage of complete pottery, including bowls, jars, juglets, and plates, probably dating to ca. 900 B.C.E. Further study of the furnace bases and micromagnetic material will provide a wealth of information about this little-known, very early iron technology. AL-BASATIN IN WADI ZIQLAB, NORTHERN JORDAN Kevin Gibbs, University of Manchester, Seiji Kad owaki, the University Museum, University of Tokyo, and E.B. Banning, University of Toronto, report: During 2009, the Wadi Ziqlab Project renewed ex cavations at al-Basatin in Wadi Ziqlab, al-Kura district, northern Jordan, previously excavated in 2002, 2004, and 2006. The new excavations focused on uncover ing further evidence for occupation at the site in the Late Neolithic (ca. 5700-5300 B.C.E.) and in EB I (ca. 3700-3300 B.C.E.). During the 2009 season, we opened approximately 80 m2, bringing the total exca vated area at the site to almost 250 m2. The site is on a broad, sloping terrace on the south side of Wadi Ziqlab, about 30 masl in a part of the val ley where numerous springs feed a perennial stream, and where modern land use is mainly devoted to pomegranates and olives. The site is immediately op posite the classical site of Tell Abu Fokhkhar and ap proximately 1 km downstream from Tell Rakan I, which has evidence for Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPN-B), Late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age activity, and Tell Rakan II, which was likely an EB I olive oil processing facility. 8Veldhuijzen 2009. Late Neolithic The 2009 excavations at al-Basatin uncovered a number of Neolithic architectural features, includ ing the stone walls of a small, circular building about 3 m in diameter, a possible cobbled floor, and some stone-filled pits. Most of the Late Neolithic archi tecture encountered in previous seasons consisted of cobble floors with no associated walls, suggesting that they may have been the floors of tents or other nonpermanent structures. The new circular structure indicates that more substantial architecture occurred on the site and lends credence to our earlier sugges tion that an arc of stones with an associated hearth excavated previously could have been a remnant of a similar circular house. Neolithic chipped-stone artifacts from al-Basatin notably include sickle elements with both ends trun cated, sometimes with steep retouch on one edge, and usually with deep denticulations on the cutting edge. One of the backed bitruncated sickle elements from the 2009 season, measuring 7.1 x 3.2 cm (fig. 3, far left), is distinctively larger than the rest of the sickle elements, which range from 2 to 6 cm in length. The most common lithic tools, however, are retouched flakes, scrapers, denticulates, and notches. Rarer are retouched blades, borers, truncations, burins, and axes/adzes/chisels. Ground-stone artifacts from the 2009 season include a grinding slab, made of porous basalt, with a concave grinding surface. The Late Neolithic pottery is crudely constructed and poorly fired, yet occasionally shows surface treat ment or decoration, including combing, impressions, incisions, red slip, and, more rarely, black burnished surfaces. Where form is evident, cups, bowls, and small jars are common. These sometimes have small ledge handles or larger loop handles, and usually flat disk bases. Faunal remains at the site are poorly preserved, but the Late Neolithic deposits include Ovis sp./ Capra sp. (sheep/goat), Bos taurus (cattle), and Sus scrofa (pig), as well as smaller quantities of Cervidae (deer), Canidae (dogs or wolves), Gazellasp. (gazelles), Vulpes sp. (fox), and Equus sp. (probably onager). Early Bronze I The 2009 excavations also clarified the form of two fairly substantial EB I structures that had been partly exposed in previous excavation seasons. One of these now appears to be a circular building, approximately 5 m in diameter. The other is a rectangular building, approximately 6 m wide. Its southeastern corner had</page><page sequence="8">512 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 Fig. 3. Neolithic sickle elements from al-Basatin, with 10 cm scale. Note the variations in size. been carefully paved with potsherds, and a small, stone feature was built on the floor. Unfortunately, the pres ence of numerous olive trees and cactus pear plants prevented the complete exposure of either building. Several other segments of EB I walls were encountered, including one that was built against the northwestern edge of the circular structure. The Early Bronze Age pottery continues to be pre dominantly early in EB I, with no evidence for "grain wash" or "band-slip" ware, with the exception of a single sherd identified in a previous season. Interest ingly, "gray burnished" ware, which is considered a characteristic of early EB I in northern Jordan, is also absent at al-Basatin. Once again, holemouth jars are common, typically with round or square rims. These are often decorated with a band of oblique impressions or short incisions on the rim and sometimes show evi dence for a thin, red slip. Other vessel forms include jars, bowls, and small juglets. Handles are strap or loop handles, small lugs, and ledges, with rare examples of thumb-impressed ledge handles. The excavations near the Early Bronze Age struc tures added several more Canaanean blades and tabu lar scrapers to the previous inventory. Some of these blades are retouched and show sickle sheen on the edge. One of the tabular scrapers also has a glossy area at the distal edge. Both of these tool types are made of brown, fine-grained flint with chalky cortex. Although this raw material is locally available, the debitage as semblage does not indicate their production on-site. The core-reduction technology at the Early Bronze Age occupation is oriented toward the production of flakes and coarse blades, which provided blanks for informal tool types, such as scrapers, notches, and denticulates. Other EB I artifacts from the site include fragments of limestone and basalt mortars or vessels, bone and marine shell beads, and a few thick sherds that have a green residue on the interior. These may be fragments of crucibles used in copperworking, even though the nearest copper source lies some 180 km to the south. The recovery of a number of carbonized olive pits indi cates the use of this resource in the Early Bronze Age, probably for the production of olive oil. This may ex plain the large number of storage jars from the site. As in previous seasons, the 2009 excavations at al Basatin also produced smaller numbers of artifacts from the Classical, PPN-B, and Epipaleolithic periods. TALL ABU AL-KHARAZ Peter M. Fischer, Gothenburg University, reports: After a lengthy break that was devoted to the pub lication of the final reports on the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Ages of Tall Abu al-Kharaz,9 the 11th and 12th seasons of excavation at the site were devoted mainly to the Iron Age occupation to achieve a re fined stratigraphy and obtain additional radiocarbon dates for the forthcoming volume on the Iron Age.10 Excavations were concentrated on areas 7 and 9, which produced the best-preserved Iron Age remains dur ing earlier seasons. The uppermost layers of occupation produced fairly well-preserved architecture, including parts of the city wall belonging to the Abbasid period. In addition to the typical Abbasid pottery of the ninth century C.E., a (gilded?) object of bronze with incised geometric patterns should be mentioned: our preliminary inter pretation is that it is a table or hanging lamp. There are at least three phases of Iron Age occu pation directly below the Abbasid remains. The most recent Iron Age occupation should, in conventional terms, be dated to Iron IIC, whereas an earlier occu pation is preliminarily ascribed to Iron IIB. Certain pottery shapes, such as cooking pots with triangular rims, may represent the Iron I phase; however, no architectural remains have been found that can be indisputably assigned to this period. There are now five "four-room" houses exposed in area 7, each a little less than 10 x 10 m in ground plan. Their layouts are comparable and consist of two pairs of rooms flanking a centrally placed and partly roofed courtyard. It is likely that there had been second sto 9Fischer 2006a, 2006b, 2008. 10Fischer (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="9">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 513 ries. To the east of these houses is a compound that is identified as a workshop for the production of metal tools. These tools include numerous arrowheads, a sickle of iron, and a bronze dagger. Living rooms for the craftsmen are incorporated in the compound. There is also strong evidence of textile production in all the houses. The pottery, which belongs to the typical Iron II repertoire at the site, includes rounded and carinated bowls, jugs and juglets (plain, shaved, and burnished, the latter including the characteristic "blackjuglets"), kraters, pilgrim flasks, lamps, cooking pots, and stor age jars (several of which have a capacity of more than 100 liters). There are clay pots with three stump legs, obviously imitations of the more elaborate tripod bowls of basalt, of which there are also several from our Iron Age contexts. The handle of one jar shows a rectangu lar seal impression. An ostrakon of a storage jar should be mentioned: the partly preserved inscription is in a Transjordanian dialect/Old Hebrew. There are three letters: "r," "q," and most likely "p." The interpreta tion is speculative, but it could be read as "only (for)," which comes directly before a name.11 There are imports from Phoenicia, Assyria, and Cyprus: for example, Red-on-Black Ware from the Cypro-Geometric III period. One of the intact Phoe nician juglets shows an inwardly folded rim, a double handle, and knobs resembling the rivets of its metal counterpart (fig. 4). Among the Assyrian imports are a red-painted carinated bowl and a red-painted Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal of steatite/enstatite with the representation of a bearded male with an ankle length decorated robe aiming a bow and arrow at an ungulate heading toward a tree (fig. 5). There are two symbols above the animal: one is a double wedge and the other a half-moon. Other objects for daily use include millstones, mor tars, flint blades, loomweights of sun-dried clay, and spindlewhorls. The jewelry recovered consists of car nelian beads and several fibulas of bronze and iron. The most extraordinary find is represented by an in tact cosmetic palette that is superbly manufactured from alabaster/calcite and decorated with incised circles; it still contains the remains of the last-used cosmetics?one is of an intense light blue color and the other is lilac. The fieldwork plan for area 9 during the 2009 sea son was only to clean and consolidate the city walls from the Early Bronze Age through the Abbasid peri od and to gather survey data for all the visible walls to create digital three-dimensional reconstructions.

The cleaning process exposed, however, an almost square structure (4.4 x 4.2 m) that was built on top of the Middle/Late Bronze Age city wall and protruded outward. This structure is the best-preserved occur</page><page sequence="10">514 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 rence of Iron Age occupation ever found at the site. After the removal of the burnt-out roof (a 0.10-0.15 m thick layer of twig-reinforced sun-dried clay), we excavated a storage room with numerous intact or complete objects. The discovery of such a remarkable depositional context?where none of the room's many objects were disturbed after the conflagration?came as a surprise, considering how close the room was to the surface. The space is enclosed by four walls, three of which are preserved to a height of 1 m. There is a 0.12 m thick wooden roof support approximately in the center of the room. A 0.8 m wide entrance is in the northwestern corner, together with a step leading up to the next room, which could not be excavated because of shortage of time. In the southeastern cor ner of the passage to the next room is a door socket of limestone. The room was crowded with objects intermingled with an ashy destruction layer. Eighteen complete earthenware vessels were exposed: three juglets, one strainer jug, one krater, and 13 jars. Three jars con tained the remains of (barley?) flour, of which one had as much as 4 kg still preserved. The krater held the dried remains of what were most likely olive oil and ol ive pits. Basalt finds included a mortar, a millstone, and a spindlewhorl, which was probably reused because its shape and production technique definitely belong in the Early Bronze Age. A cylindrical, ribbed spindle whorl of fired clay, which is of a shape uncommon at the site, was also recovered. A sheet of bronze might belong to the door construction. A stone cylinder, 0.3 m long and 0.23 m in diameter, shows a centrally placed depression on one side, whereas the other side is broken off; it was used for crushing olives. In summary, to date, we have clear evidence of Iron IIB and IIC occupation at the site, whereas the Iron I period is represented only by stray finds. KHIRBET AL-BATRAWY Lorenzo Nigro, Rome "La Sapienza" University, reports: Khirbet al-Batrawy was identified in 2004 as an Early Bronze Age fortified site?the main site of Upper Wadi az-Zarqa in that period. The site has been the object of systematic excavations and restorations by Rome "La Sapienza" University since May 2005. Five seasons were conducted at the site, bringing to light EB II?III for tifications (areas B north, C, D, E), several clusters of EB IVB dwellings (areas A, B, D, F), the EB II city gate and some EB III buildings inside it (area B south), the 12Nigro 2006, 2008a, 2008b; Nigro et al. 2008; Nigro and Sala2009. 13 The use of this term reflects a historical-archaeological northwestern (areaC) and southwestern (areaD) cor ner towers, and the EB II?III Broad-Room Temple on the easternmost terrace (area F).12 The fourth (2008) and fifth (2009) seasons focused mainly on the explo ration of the northern fortifications, with the city gate, the quarter of dwellings and public buildings inside it (area B), and the easternmost terrace with the Broad Room Temple (area F), as well as on the excavations of EB IV sparse dwellings in the same areas. From Villages to Town: Upper Wadi Az-Zarqa in the Third Millennium B. C.E. Archaeological surveys carried out along the Zarqa River illustrated settlement dynamics leading to the birth of the city of Batrawy. The population settled during EB I in farmhouses and hamlets exploiting the favorable environment of the river at the begin ning of the third millennium B.C.E., grouped on the khirbet of Batrawy. The erection of a massive city wall encircling the whole site and making it dominate the surrounding landscape marked the birth of the city,13 distinguished by a complex socioeconomic organiza tion, centralization of functions, concentration of la bor, agricultural products and goods exchange, and territorial control extending over tracks crossing the steppe and the desert and entering the Wadi az-Zarqa and, through it, the Jordan Valley. The Northern Fortifications and City Gate (Area B North) The Main City Wall erected in EB II was a stone structure 2.9-3.2 m thick, with a solid base employ ing large limestone blocks on the outer side (with an abutting foot), and curtain walls including a central fill made of medium-sized stones. The foundation reached the height of 2 m; over it was a mudbrick superstructure about 4.5 m high, making the whole defensive work 6.5 m high. A 1.6 m wide gate opened through this wall. This gate was intentionally blocked after an earthquake destroyed a great part of the city at the end of EB II (ca. 2700 B.C.E.). An outer wall (W.155), made of huge blocks, was added to the forti fication line at the beginning of EB III. This structure was then further reinforced in EB IIIB by adjoining to it a third scarp wall (W.165), also made of big stones and blocks with a battering face, ending against the former with a semicircular bastion (W.825). Moreover, a curvilinear (W.185) and a rectangular (W.177) out work protruded from these walls in EB IIIA and IIIB, respectively, presumably to protect the EB III city gate, located to the west (fig. 6). interpretation that attempts to highlight the difference be tween the socioeconomic model of village life (in use until the rise of the city of Batrawy in the Upper Wadi az-Zarqa) and</page><page sequence="11">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 515 Fig. 6. Khirbet al-Batrawy. General view of the Early Bronze II?III triple-line of fortifications and annexed structures on the northern side of the site (area B), from the west in 2009. Inside the Main City Wall, two symmetrical staircases made of slabs protruding from the wall itself were dis covered; the slabs served as brackets to support wood en planks. Such architectural devices gave quick access to the upper part of the city wall, thus demonstrating that there was an upper passageway. Houses and Buildings of the City (Area B South) Inside the triple fortification line, an area of dense occupation was excavated with structures preserved up to 1.4 m. Buildings were constructed with medium sized stones at the ground floor and mudbricks and wooden posts for the superstructure and were sepa rated from the main city wall by a 1.8 m wide street. Building Bl included at least two rooms and a stair case. Against its eastern wall, a semicircular oven was adjoined, paved with basalt slabs and grinding stones. Farther east, there was a rectangular house (B2) with a circular basin in the middle and a fireplace in the northeastern corner. At the opposite side of the area, another large building (B3) was discovered that con tained a series of large pithoi. These huge containers, which show the traces of the fierce fire that destroyed the city at the end of EB IIIB (ca. 2350 B.C.E.), were aligned against the north wall. Their presence testifies to a central administration capable of concentrating foodstuff and goods. The same picture of the earliest city of Batrawy is provided by analysis of other finds (seashells, copper items, tokens) and faunal and pa leobotanical remains: the city controlled olive oil pro duction in the nearby hills west of the Zarqa River, and it was a crossroads for donkey caravans crossing the desert. The Broad-Room Temple (Area F) A large temple was discovered on the easternmost terrace of the hill that dominates the pass into the Upper Wadi az-Zarqa Valley; its architecture is typi cal of other temples from the late fourth and third millennia B.C.E. in the southern Levant. The temple was a broad-room, preceded by a forecourt, in which several cult installations stood, including a circular that of a fortified settlement or city in the Early Bronze Age Jordanian context. The term "city" thus achieves here a very specific use, depending on the scale of the phenomenon in such a region in the third millennium B.C.E.</page><page sequence="12">516 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 altar (diam. 2.5 m, ht. 0.4 m), with a slab and a cup mark in the middle, and a freestanding betyl. The cella had a niche facing the entrance, with a raised bench inside. After the destruction of the earliest building, which occurred at the end of EB II (ca. 2700 B.C.E.) as the result of a terrible earthquake that destroyed the city, the temple was reconstructed with some chang es: a new entrance and a new cult focus. A platform was erected on the western side of the cella, with a horseshoe-shaped niche against the west wall. Facing this structure, a couple of betyls stood upright. The temple of Batrawy finds a striking parallel in a similar sacred building discovered at Bab edh-Dhra' on the Dead Sea plain, thus showing the unity of religious tradition during the Early Bronze Age, at the dawn of the earliest urban culture in Jordan. QUSEIR AMRA Fadi Bala'awi, Hashemite University, reports: Quseir Amra is a World Heritage site located in a remote area of the Jordanian desert on the highway between Amman and Al-Azraq. In Arabic, the word quseir refers to a small palace. The current project aims to study the main physical and chemical proper ties of the building materials of Quseir Amra and to establish an environmental monitoring program for the site. The study will also evaluate all the internal and external decay features of the structure. The research will define the necessary practical, remedial, and pre ventive practices required at the site and will create a long-term, comprehensive plan for the management and conservation of the site. The current project started in January 2009 and will be completed by December 2010. The project was divi ded into four main phases and is now in phase 3. The first phase involved creating a detailed docu mentation system for the building structure and ex ternal and internal decay issues, collecting samples for analyses, as well as observing the environment sur rounding the palace. Two small tag data loggers were installed at the quseir to record the relative humidity and temperature conditions. One of these loggers was installed inside the quseir, and another outside. The microclimate data from these loggers will provide a detailed record for monitoring both the interior and external conditions at the quseir. Collecting samples from a World Heritage site is a challenging and debatable issue. The size and number of samples should be minimized from an ethical point of view, but this must be balanced against the lack of sufficient information regarding the building materi als. This information is necessary to understand the main causes of decay that could result in the gradual loss of this unique cultural heritage resource. It was thus necessary to develop a responsible sampling strat egy that provided the required data without further endangering the monument. The building material on the quseir can be divided into four main types: the main building stone (lime stone), the cementing material, the internal plaster, and the pigment materials. Approximately 16 lime stone samples were collected either from a fallen rock or a nonvisible location within the quseir so as not to affect the site aesthetically or structurally. In addition, approximately 10 samples of cementing materials were collected, also from nonvisible locations for the same reasons. A few very small samples of internal plaster and pigment materials were also collected. The preliminary results from an evaluation of weath ering processes show that stone breakout, fractures, cracks, scaling, and salt efflorescence are the primary external decay factors, while flaking, scaling, wash out, salt efflorescence, and subefflorescence are the main threats within the interior of the palace. The documentation process included the use of a high resolution camera and a monthly schedule of on-site observation to record any development of the decay elements in the structure. This phase also included a study and evaluation of the surrounding environmen tal conditions, in particular, the traffic-related threats from the neighboring highway. The study was able to demonstrate that traffic vibrations were responsible for a fracture on the main gate. During the second phase, a large number of labora tory tests were conducted on the samples of the four building materials at Quseir Amra as the first step in selecting suitable conservation procedures. These tests are vital for understanding the physical and me chanical properties of the materials so that the decay processes can be identified and suitable remedial and preventative measures designed. Petrography, poros ity, permeability, water-absorption capacity, water uptake capacity, salt content, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) tests were performed on the limestone build ing material. The chemical content of the cement and plaster samples was analyzed using XRF, while ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) tests were used, respectively, to measure the anion and cation content of these samples (table 1). The early results showed that the limestone has a high effective and fine porosity. The porosity ranged between 15.2 and 13.9%. This type of porosity is quite dangerous because the absorbed moisture in the stone will remain for longer periods and could activate salt decay and growth of mold within the building, as well as encourage insect inhabitation. The project is now in the third phase, during which all the physical and chemical properties of the building stone will be considered to understand the</page><page sequence="13">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 517 Table 1.

QUSEIR SHABEEB Mohammed Waheeb, Hashemite University, reports: The structure known as Quseir Shabeeb is situated in the city center of Zarqa district and surrounded by modern houses and paved roads. It is one of the medieval forts located on the Darb al Hajj al-Shami (Syrian pilgrimage route). Unlike any of the other Ottoman hajj forts, Quseir Shabeeb occupies a prom inent position on a spur between the Wadi Zarqa and the Wadi Duhleil. Various pilgrims and travelers since the 17th century C.E. recorded their visits to the quseir, including Abed al-Kader al-Jazery (1600), Mohammad Bakebreet (1630), Ibrahim al-Khayary (1669), Meriell (1875), Olephant (1880), Moham mad al-Sanusi (1881), Butler (1909), and Mahmoud al-Abedi (1927). In 2009, the site was thoroughly investigated by a multidisciplinary team from the Queen Rania Institute of Tourism and Heritage at the Hashemite University. The research team consisted of Waheeb (archaeolo gist), Yahya Shawabkeh (photogrammetry specialist), Fawaz Ishaqat (survey engineer), and FatimaJalboosh (archaeologist). The project is divided into three phases: (1) documentation and assessment, (2) test soundings and excavations, and (3) site conservation and management. Architecturally, this quseir is less complicated than other similar structures in Jordan. The building is a square construction measuring 13.75 m per side. It is built of large limestone blocks, about 0.45 m in height and 0.40-1.00 m in length. The outer faces of most of the blocks are roughly embossed, with a smooth, approximately 0.07 m wide border around the edges. The average preserved height of the walls is 8 m above the present ground surface. Triangular crenellations, composed of stones set at 45? angles, align the top of the fort on three sides. Regarding the outside of the building, the south facade is the most important, as it has the entrance and two arrow-slit windows that have built stone arch es above them. The entrance is 1.75 m wide and is surmounted by a large, pointed arch with a height of 3.4 m; the entranceway is a feature that was briefly described by some of the early travelers. The arch is constructed of two courses of finely cut ashlars. Above the arch point, there is a recessed limestone block that may have once displayed an inscription. On another side of the building is a slightly smaller doorway mea suring 2.10 x 1.75 m. The other sides of the building each have at least one arrow-slit window as well. The interior of the first story is square in shape, and the ceiling is constructed of large, pointed barrel vaults. Large, deep recesses, containing one slit win dow each, are set in all the walls except the entrance sidewalk A staircase leading to the second story was built to the left side of the entrance. Very little of the second story is preserved because of the extent of the natural and human damage endured by the building. Some traces of wall foundations are still visible, suggesting a mixture of large and small rooms within the superstructure, most of which were removed in the past. There are also a few steps that indicate the existence of a stairway leading to the roof. The quseirwas furnished with water cisterns, and we have estimated that these must have had depths of at least 2 m. One of these is still visible, located on the south side about 3.5 m from the entrance. It was ac cessed through a square opening (0.60 m2), which was bordered by a curb built using beveled stones. The documentation and assessment portion of the research focused on creating a detailed description of the building remains and the construction materials used. Some of the highlights of the features recorded are summarized in this short report. All the results from the recent investigation will be used for creating new plans for the conservation, management, and develop ment of sustainable tourism opportunities. ISLAMIC JARASH PROJECT Louise Blanke and Alan Walmsley, University of Copenhagen, report:</page><page sequence="14">518 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 The Joint Danish-Jordanian Islamic Jarash Proj ect (IJP) is directed by Walmsley and sponsored by University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The project commenced in 2002 with the principal objective of excavating an Early Islamic (Umayyad) mosque. It has since expanded to include a Late Roman bathhouse, along with a series of larger buildings immediately west of the mosque. In 2008, the project expanded across the town's central thoroughfare (cardo), integrating a monumental civic building flanked by a series of shops. The primary research questions relate to the layout and nature of the Early Islamic town center, and the IJP has taken a leading role in establishing the importance and prosperity of Jarash in the Early Islamic period. The seventh and eighth excavation seasons took place in August 2008 and May-June 2009, respec tively. The following provides a brief account of the four main excavation areas, along with a note on new initiatives within the project. The Late Roman Bathhouse The Central Bathhouse takes its name from its loca tion in the commercial center of the town between the south decumanus and the cardo and has been dated, based on numismatic and ceramic finds, from the sec ond to seventh centuries. The baths follow a general north-south orientation, with the entrance and un heated section to the north and the heated section and the service area to the south. Besides the bathhouse proper, the building consists of a latrine and a series of shops that flanked the south decumanus. Excavations in 2008 focused on the unheated section of the bathhouse (frigidarium) and the changing room (apodyterium), with the hope of locating the entrance to the building. Excavation demonstrated that the bath house was entered through a north-facing door from an east-west running corridor that also gave access to a semicircular latrine. This form of latrine is normally associated with North African bathhouses and, to our knowledge, only one other example has been found in the Near East. The door to the bathhouse gave di rect access to the changing room through a paved corridor. From this corridor, the bather could access the frigidarium, consisting of a rectangular room with benches and flanked by two deep semicircular pools, intended for communal bathing. Excavation proved that only the western pool remained in use throughout the life of the bathhouse. The entrance to the bathing complex proper was identified west of the corridor in 2009, proving that the bath complex was accessed from a lane leading south from the decumanus. The Mosque Toward the end of the seventh century, the bath house was dismantled, and the area was redeveloped for use as a mosque. Rather than being aligned with the town's major thoroughfares, the mosque followed the rough orientation of Mecca. The building mea sures 35 x 40 m and consisted of an open courtyard (sahn) surrounded by a colonnaded portico with a prayer hall taking up the southern third of the build ing. The prayer hall contained two rows of columns that supported a triple-gabled roof construction, simi lar to that of the great Umayyad mosque in Damascus. The qibla wall was equipped with three prayer niches (mihrab), of which no more than two were in use at any one time. The main entrance to the building was located on the decumanus, although at some point that entrance was blocked. A semicircular staircase, leading from the cardo into the courtyard of the mosque, has been identified as a later addition to the layout of the build ing. Other, later additions include a minaret in the northeastern corner of the building, as well as a parti tion wall separating the western quarter of the prayer hall from the rest. This section contained a separate mihrab and could be accessed from a doorway leading directly into the prayer hall. The 2008 and 2009 seasons saw the completion of the excavation of the mosque. The 2008 season ap proached selected areas in the prayer hall through minor soundings that were undertaken to clarify features such as foundations and wall constructions. In 2009, a 10 x 10 m square was excavated along the northern part of the western mosque wall. The exca vations uncovered another side entrance consisting of a staircase and door giving access from the inter section between a north-south and an east-west run ning laneway. Immediately south of the entrance, the remains of an ablution fountain, measuring 1.35 x 3.00 m, were uncovered. The feature was fed by a pipe coming through the mosque wall from below the level of the adjacent laneway. West of the Mosque In 2007, excavations expanded to the area northwest of the mosque. Examinations of this area revealed a two-room structure facing out onto an open courtyard to the north. Excavations in 2008 uncovered paved floors, a tabun, a work area, and two functioning door ways, each preceded by a step to keep out the rising level of the courtyard to the north. A later phase of use of the area saw the blocking of this doorway, while the courtyard surface was used for waste disposal. The primary occupational phase, so far documented, ap pears to belong to the Abbasid period. A rare discovery in this area is what may well be an ink bowl, carved from a greenish stone with white and dark gray striations. The pottery looks suspiciously like Abbasid types identified at Khirbat al-Mafjar and Pella,</page><page sequence="15">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 519 including a red painted jar with a high neck, and so called Mefjar Ware of demonstrable ninth-century date and later in Bilad al-Sham. In 2009, excavation commenced east of the two room structure and revealed remains of another building. To date, the building is defined by two walls and an extensive area of tumbled stone. A cistern was identified within the last days of excavation. Further work remains to be done to tie this structure to the surrounding architecture and define its function and chronology. The Eastern Building In 2008, new excavations were initiated across the cardo to the east of the mosque. The excavation com menced in two 10 x 10 m squares adjacent to the cardo that documented a series of shops, built against the wall of a building, running parallel to the cardo. East of this wall, a series of paved rooms was uncovered. At present, the layout of the building suggests a size similar to or potentially larger than that of the mosque. Excavations have documented two major architectural phases. The later of these phases has been assigned to the Middle Islamic period (ca. 1000 C.E.), based on numismatic and ceramic finds. This phase was constructed on top of an earlier building of a similar layout, partially reusing it. This situation suggests that the original building was almost completely destroyed, perhaps resulting from an earthquake. Although the purpose of the building is not yet clear, the discovery of two lead seals, along with the sherds of many large storage vessels, point to a gov ernmental/administrative role. Future Work Objectives for the upcoming 2010 season include completing the excavation of the bathhouse and fur ther exploration of the area west of the mosque. Also, two new squares will be opened across the cardo to the east of the current excavation. The careful process of restoring the mosque for future preservation and tourism was begun in 2009. This work will continue over the next five years and is expected to increase the public perception of Jarash as a significant Islamic period town. JARASH HINTERLAND SURVEY Fiona Baker, First Archaeological Services, Scotland, and David Kennedy, University of Western Australia, report: Jarash, ancient Gerasa, is one of the best known and most well-preserved cities of the Decapolis. The western half of the walled city is preserved as an ar chaeological park, but the remainder of the area within the ancient walls lies under the modern town of Jarash. The fine public buildings of ancient Gerasa have received considerable archaeological attention, but the more mundane remains outside the city walls have been little explored or recorded. Modern de velopment is progressing rapidly outside the ancient city walls, and the population of Jarash has doubled from 21,000 people in the mid 1990s to 42,000 in 2009. The new developments, and the ubiquitous problem of tomb robbing, threaten the archaeologi cal remains outside the walled area of the ancient city. Since a city is supported by the activities and industries of its surrounding area, these previously unrecorded archaeological remains have the potential to provide valuable information about the lives of the inhabitants of ancient Gerasa. The Jarash Hinterland Survey was initiated in 2005 to survey and record an area of 10 km2 around and outside the ancient walled city that is threatened by the ever-expanding modern setdements (fig. 7). Two seasons of survey (2005, 2008), covering an area of 2.5 km2, have been completed, and a third season will take place in 2010.14 The objectives of the survey are to record archaeo logical remains of all periods outside the ancient city walls, to identify archaeological remains for conser vation, to develop an understanding of the nature of the city and its immediate hinterland, and to define land use and changes over time. The objectives of the project are being met by various means: intensive walking survey of all open spaces (including gardens) and detailed GPS recording of sites; completion of prepared recording forms linked to an access data base; documentation using photographs, sketches, and measured drawings; and the collection of portable artifacts and inscriptions. Preliminary reports on both seasons along with the database have been submit ted to the Department of Antiquities, and specialist analysis of the ceramics, coins, and other small finds is currently underway. During the two completed seasons, 622 new archaeo logical sites were recorded within the 2.5 km2 area (see fig. 7). Most of the sites are of broad Roman date; funer ary monuments are the majority, followed in number by sites with architectural fragments, artifact scatters, and quarries (table 2). Given the proximity of the sur vey areas to the ancient city, it is perhaps not surprising that burial monuments and architectural fragments dominate the statistics thus far. Some concentrations of architectural fragments suggest major monumental buildings.

As the survey moves farther out from the city walls, we might expect to find more agricultural remains such as olive and wine presses and farmsteads. During the 2008 season, a rapid walking survey of the Wadi Deir to the north of the city was undertaken. In contrast to the urban and semiurban areas surveyed, this cultivated area produced considerable evidence for ancient water management, including fragments of water channels leading to the city from the springs at Birketein to the north. Water management was vital to the success of ancient Gerasa, and it is hoped that further survey will locate more evidence of the water supply system. The road leading from the North Gate to Birketein was described by the Yale excavators in the 1930s as a "Via Sacra" lined with tombs and mausolea. The survey recorded one fairly well-preserved (and previ ously known) mausoleum and identified four distinct platforms adjacent to the road, which may represent temples or mausolea. Several high-quality architec tural fragments and two Greek inscriptions were also recovered from bulldozer heaps associated with a new medical center just outside the North Gate. These might represent the Temple of Nemesis recorded hereabouts in the 1930s. Despite the number of new sites documented by the survey, certainly many others have been lost, obscured, or destroyed over the centuries because of the continu ous occupation and use of the areas. Site visibility is also an issue, as both fluvial soil deposits and dumps from the new developments likely obscure additional archaeological remains. The impact of modern de velopment is considerable. Of the 227 sites recorded by the survey in 2005, 188 of these were revisited in 2008 to assess their condition. We found that 121 sites remained unchanged, 32 had been damaged, and 35 had been destroyed by new development. This means that at least 30% of the sites recorded in 2005 had been damaged or destroyed within three years. It is anticipated that the 2010 season will locate more archaeological sites farther out from the core of the ancient city. It is hoped that present and future dis coveries will add to the emerging picture of how the city interacted with its hinterland and will elucidate the lives of the ancient inhabitants of Gerasa. TELL ABU SUWWAN Maysoon Al-Nahar, University of Jordan, reports: Tell Abu Suwwan is the only Neolithic site excavated north of the Zarqa River in Jordan. The work was con ducted by the University of Jordan over four seasons (2005-2008).

The results from the first three seasons in each area of the site determined the work executed in 2008. The working area of the site was divided by the exca vator into two parts: area A, which was located on the northwest side of the site; and area B, located on the northeast side of the site. A number of new excavation squares were opened and some earlier squares were reopened for further investigation. In addition, sev eral balks were systematically excavated to clarify some of the interior walls. In area A, two new squares were excavated (H2 and H5/6) and two older squares re opened (D5 and E2). In area B, nine new squares were excavated (AO, G8, H8, 18, J8, K7, K8, L5, N7), and five squares were reopened (F7, F8, G7, H7, K7); the balks removed in area B during this season included one existing balk (G7/F7) and two new ones (F8/E8 and I7/J7). Both areas A and B produced numerous lithics, fauna, and some small finds. In area B, the main building walls and a platform were clarified, and all of the structure's walls and its features were revealed. This involved uncovering the rectilinear extensions to the main building, which contained plaster floors and heat-treated mudbricks. The clarification of the building and its extensions demonstrated that the structure was built and modi fied gradually through the occupation of different Neolithic periods at the site. It seems that the structure was started as a single household during the MPPN-B and reused and modified during the Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (LPPN-B) and the Yarmoukian periods. The physical changes and modifications of the struc ture were probably the result of the structure's evolv ing function and role within the Tell Abu Suwwan Neolithic community. These modifications might have been related to socioeconomic changes that took place within the LPPN-B and Yarmoukian periods. The modifications of the area B building included build ing up parallel interior walls. This type of structure is known among Neolithic specialists as a "grill building," and was first identified at "Cayonii" in Anatolia.17 The grill building shape at Tell Abu Suwwan suggests an information exchange relationship between these two Neolithic communities. Three Neolithic burials were discovered under the floors during the 2008 season. One was found under the mud floor of the small structure in area A. The other two burials were found in area B: one to the south of the cobble floor in the extension structure located toward the east side of the grill building, and the other within a circle cut into a plaster floor in the northeast side of area B. AERIAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN David Kennedy, University of Western Australia, and Robert Bewley, Heritage Lottery Fund, report: The 14th season (2008) involved 10 weeks in Jordan, and the 15th (2009) ran for six weeks. Thanks to a grant from the Packard Humanities Institute (PHI), the proj ect was able to quadruple the number of annual flying hours and time spent in the field engaged in ground inspection. Almost 80 hours flying were completed (bringing our overall total to 202 hours since 1997) 15A1-Nahar2005, 2008. 16A1-Nahar2010. 176zdoganl999.</page><page sequence="19">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 523 and some 20,000 photographs were taken, recording about 2,000 locales during these two seasons. The primary objective continues to be the recording of archaeological remains throughout the country. Our priorities for reconnaissance remain those regions in which development poses the greatest threat and those that are least well known. The former is overwhelm ingly the Greater Amman area, where the expansion of housing and industry has been accelerated recently by the construction of a major highway running around the south, from near Qastal on the Desert Highway to the motorway northeast of Marka. In addition to land developed for the road and its interchanges, there are numerous traces of areas being prepared nearby for housing. For the latter, less well-known regions, two areas were selected. Firstly, the Harrat Ash Shaam, the.volcanic lava region (harra) stretching from Umm el-Jimal eastward for about 180 km and spanning the entire width of the panhandle from southern Syria into northern Saudi Arabia. From the air, we have re corded hundreds of the many thousands of stone-built structures found about the area?most notably kites (fig. 8), but increasingly also wheels, pendants, cairn fields, and the many traces of long walls. Secondly, an area targeted in both years is that east of Petra from Shaubak to Ras en-Naqb, not least because it also pro vides an opportunity to research an extensive "Roman" landscape of villages (fig. 9), farmsteads, military sites, roads and tracks, and areas of fossilized fields. Several sites were revisited as part of our monitoring program of those most at threat. Others were reexamined to clarify details not previously seen. The PHI grant has enabled us to develop the proj ect in other ways. Aerial images are now being made available to researchers on the Internet through Flickr.18 In addition to recent digital images, complete with georeference and keywords, we are progressively digitizing thousands of film photographs taken since 1997. At time of writing (February 2010), more than 12,000 images may now be viewed on a searchable site. Potential users are invited to register as a member to obtain the fullest benefit. We have also encouraged field projects in Jordan to request imagery to be taken in the course of future flights. Since 2008, we have sup plied extensive imagery to 17 colleagues. In 2008, we were able to mount a four-day residential workshop in aerial archaeology in Amman, run jointly with the Department of Antiquities and with financial support from PHI and the Arab League Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ALESCO). Sev enteen students from 14 Arab countries participated in three days of lectures and practical sessions, followed by a flight for students in small groups. Fuller accounts of our work have been published elsewhere,19 and a chapter exploring the role of aeri al imagery in cultural resources management will be published in 2010.20 Future efforts will continue the work of recording, monitoring, supporting colleagues in their ground surveys and excavation, and in pursu ing our own research interests on the stone structures in the Basalt Desert (Harrat Ash Shaam) and Roman landscapes. Inquiries from colleagues seeking aerial imagery are welcome. TALL AL-'UMAYRI Douglas R. Clark, La Sierra University, and Larry G. Herr, Canadian University College, report: The 2008 excavations at Tall al-'Umayri, part of the Madaba Plains Project, represent the 12th season of research at the site, an important Bronze and Iron Age settlement with 21 identified strata. Carried out in cooperation with the Department of Antiquities of Jordan under Director General Fawwaz al-Khraysheh, the excavations were sponsored by La Sierra University in consortium with Andrews University School of Ar chitecture, Canadian University College, Mount Royal University, Pacific Union College, and Walla Walla University. A team of almost 100 individuals from the United States, Canada, and Poland joined nearly 30 local laborers in excavating 24 squares in 7 fields. Five significant architectural finds are presented chrono logically in this report. Early Bronze I Dolmen and Environs The EB I dolmen, excavated during the 1990s (field K, supervised by Elzbieta Dubis, Krakow, Poland), was significant because of the preserved remains inside: at least 20 individuals and 20 vessels?an extremely rare find. Virtually all of the thousands of known dolmens, because of their aboveground construction, have been found empty. In addition to a series of surface levels around the structure (excavated previously and un known elsewhere), archaeologists in 2008 exposed an east-west wall with three short wall segments extend ing to the south. The structure was probably used as a shelter for people involved in ceremonial activities. As far as we know, no structures associated with dolmens have been recorded elsewhere.

Toronto) were intended to finish uncovering the Late Bronze (LB) II temple/palace (Building C) (fig. 10), which had been mostly uncovered in previous seasons, and to answer questions that remained concerning phasing, the function or interpretation of certain walls, and the definition of exterior wall faces and corners. These objectives were all achieved. Teams excavated the exterior faces of the north and south walls of the building. The northwest cor ner showed that the north wall was indeed the con tinuation of the west perimeter wall, as previously suspected. A probe beneath the floor of the shrine room with the cultic niche (Room C3) showed that the north building wall antedated the construction of Building C. Thus, the north wall, a portion of the west wall, and possibly the entire east building walls were structures reused in the plan of the building. We now understand the placement of double walls back-to-back across much of the east side of Building C as an outer wall against which an inner wall was con structed as support for an internal stairway ascending to a second floor. Excavation of the last occupation surface in the shrine room revealed floor construction of plaster and clay, sealed against the installation wall (with the cultic niche) and the presentation altar.

A rectilinear standing stone of hard limestone appeared to have fallen from this possible base and lay on other brick and plaster debris. Cultic items were found in the entry hall, including parts of three miniature bowls, partial chalices, and fragments of clay figurines similar to those found in the cultic niche. Early Iron I Settlement Fields A, H, and L were supervised, respectively, by Robert Bates (La Sierra University), Monique Vincent (University of Chicago), and David Hopkins (Wes ley Theological Seminary) and Mary Boyd (Seattle, Washington). One of the best represented periods at 'Umayri is the transitional Late Bronze Age/Iron I. Buildings A and B (the "four-room" house) atop the massive, reconstructed defense system provided only partial glimpses of what the site has since revealed. Remains from this period appear in several locations on the tell and are now broadly exposed in fields A, H, and, to some degree, field L. One of the purposes of the 2008 excavations in field A was to identify all the buildings that were associated with the occupation and destruction that took place during the Late Bronze Age/Iron I period and bring the entire field into this phase of the site's settlement history. At the northern extent of the field, a room containing extensive destruction from the Late Bronze Age/Iron I period was discovered. Mudbrick and roof detritus, including burned beams, were found col lapsed into Building E, crushing an assemblage of Late Bronze Age/Iron I collared pithoi (at least six) and other vessels. These rooms appear to have been used to process and store grain, since at least two complete grinding stones were found in situ and an installation that may have been used as a bench. Two painted "pil grim" flasks were also found. In field H, adjacent to field A on the south side, an Iron I domestic structure had already been exposed by previous excavation. Three walls form two rooms against a substantial earlier wall, with a tabun in one corner and a pithos in another. The goal this season was to bring two adjoining squares down to this same phase of occupation. After excavation of nearly 1 m of detritus, the team reached what appears to be a con tinuation of one of the walls previously found. Joining another wall, this one seems to form part of a substan tial structure, whose purpose is as yet unknown. Field L, location of a Hellenistic farmstead and late Iron II structures, also contains massive stone walls, which excavators assume are part of the extensive Iron II settlement at the site. Future excavation of this field and field M, which will join L to H, will reveal a good deal from this period.</page><page sequence="22">526 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 Iron II Building Despite several seasons of excavation, it was only in 2008 that architecture from the Iron IIB period was first distinguished at 'Umayri in field A. The structure consisted of at least three rooms: the western room had a cobble floor and an entrance from the north; the northern room, which had a doorway connected to an east-west corridor and another possible doorway lead ing to the southern room; and the southern room may have been connected to both the northern room and the western room. Stone grinders, a pounder, and pot tery dating to Iron IIB were found on the beaten-earth floor of the northern room. More Iron IIB pottery, in cluding a nearly complete bowl and semicomplete jar, was found on the floor of the southern room. Late Iron II Structures Late Iron II and Late Iron II/Persian architecture has been found in most areas on the top of the tell, in cluding the 2008 excavations in fields H, L, and M (su pervised by Aren LaBianca, China). The most recent discoveries from these periods were new structures and cobbled surfaces, likely domestic in function, in field M as well as a nearly complete tabun and large weights from an olive press in field L. MT. NEBO, ROBEBUS CRYPT Margaret Judd, University of Pittsburgh, reports: The second excavation season of the Robebus Cha pel crypt at Mt. Nebo was conducted in 2008. The one-room chapel was dedicated in a mosaic inscrip tion to the hegumen Robebus (ca. 530 CE.). East and west crypt entrances were carved into the dedicatory mosaic floor, with each entrance leading to a double hypogeum crypt. Excavations began in the north and south chambers of the east crypt during the 2007 season, and the north chamber was fully excavated. During the 2008 season, excavation continued in the southern chamber of the east crypt. The southern chamber measured approximately 2 m2 and was entered by a 0.77 m vaulted doorway. The chamber had been filled originally with a mound of seemingly disarticulated adult human bones, with 13 adult skulls placed along the west and south walls. Ex cavation could only progress from the entrance toward the south wall, and to facilitate this, the mound was divided into 0.5 x 0.5 m loci in east-west strips. Each locus was photographed with and without a planning frame before and after cleaning. The disarticulation and fragmentation of the upper most and more recent individuals were not because of postdepositional taphonomic agents. Three bro ken cranial vaults served as vessels to contain assorted fragmentary and smaller bones, such as hand and foot bones, vertebrae, and rib pieces. Once the uppermost loci were removed, articulated bones became more fre quent. Attempts had been made to inter bones in ana tomical order with complete skulls, or their elements, nearest the western wall. The postcranial remains were somewhat ordered from the skull to the feet, although bones were often inverted or laid horizontally to the body's axis. The disassociation of some long bones and their random placement indicates that the larger joints of some appendages, for example, the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee, had decomposed or were suf ficiently decomposed to become detached when the body was moved to the crypt. Articulated skeletons were found on the loci that sealed the floor. The soft tissue surrounding the lower vertebral column and pelvis is particularly complex and is the last area of the tissue to fully decompose. Acting in combination with the joint intricacies of these bones, these skeletal "cores" became anchored by the weight of the individuals added at a later date. Each body core was assigned its own locus number: the associated appendages?upper body and skull that became dislodged from the motion of additional interments and void collapses created by decomposi tion?were traced. Preliminary observations during excavation and cleaning indicate that the 18 adults thus far excavated from this chamber were predominantly older males. Dental health is very poor, with endemic abscessing, heavy wear, and antemortem tooth loss. Heavy depos its of arthritic bone lesions characteristic of aging or heavy labor were noted among numerous joint sur faces. Unexpectedly, healed rib, skull, and forearm fractures, often linked with interpersonal violence, were observed among a few individuals. Most intrigu ing were the punched-out circular voids in the skulls of five individuals, while the ribs of one individual had 2 cm long pieces of bone removed by a sharp rectangular tool. Artifacts were limited to small pieces of iron crosses and rings that had slipped between the bones in the waist area and could not be assigned to specific individ uals. The variations in health and funerary treatment among the monastics are contrary to what is expected of the corporate ascetic body. Connections between the experienced life and death of each individual will provide greater insight into the social structure of the early monastic community at Mt. Nebo. KERAK PLATEAU Deborah I. Olszewski, University of Pennsylvania, Maysoon Al-Nahar, University of Jordan, Jason Cooper, AMEC Geomatrix Consultants, and Bilal R. Khrisat, Hashemite University, report:</page><page sequence="23">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 527 Excavations were conducted at two Kerak Plateau Early Epipaleolithic rockshelters (KPS-36/4 and KPS 75) in 2009. Located in the Wadi Shouhar, north of the Wadi al-Hasa, the two sites are about 3 km apart and situated between 920 and 1,020 masl; both sites are surrounded by extremely large open spaces. The field season was dedicated to the study of these sites and their surroundings to elucidate the relationship between environmental and cultural changes. The excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Jordan with the participation of Hashemite University. Students in cluded those from Jordan University, as well as mas ter's students from Hashemite University and several from the United States and Europe. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Uni versity of Jordan, and Hashemite University. At KPS-36/4, a 1 x 1 m test unit was excavated down the slope from the rockshelter. The results of this test ing suggest that the original occupation of the site was concentrated inside the rockshelter; unfortunately, all the cultural layers and their materials were washed downslope from the rockshelter. At KPS-75,10 1 x 1 m units were excavated this sum mer, one of them inside the rockshelter and the oth ers on the slope in front of the rockshelter entrance, which faces south. The units were subdivided into 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrants and excavated in 3 cm arbitrary levels, unless natural stratigraphy was discerned. Additionally, two geological sections and one archaeological testing section were opened. One of the geological sections was established on the eastern slope of the site itself, while the other was about 1 km to the south, along the side of the wadi near the site. The archaeological test ing section was dug in the entrance of the rockshelter, near the unit excavated inside the rockshelter.21 The excavation of the KPS-75 site revealed nine levels and at least two phases of occupation at the site. The earliest Epipaleolithic phase likely dates to ca. 25,000-21,000 b.p. (calibrated), while the later phase may date either to between 21,000 and 18,000 b.p. (calibrated) or somewhat later. The earlier-phase lithic assemblage contains different types of nongeo metric narrow-backed forms of microliths, such as curved-backed and backed and truncated bladelets as well as some Qalkhan points and Ouchtata bladelets. The later phase includes some geometric microliths, such as narrow rectangles and narrow trapezes, as well as the more numerous nongeometric narrow-backed forms. Both phases yield evidence for the use of the microburin technique. About 25,000 lithics have been analyzed to date, with the remainder to be analyzed over the coming year. The preliminary analysis of the KPS-75 faunal assemblage identified gazelle, equids, aurochs, and land tortoise.22 Geoarchaeological Investigation The geoarchaeological investigations were carried out at the KPS-75 site and its surroundings to under stand its unique paleoclimatic condition and the rich archaeological remains in the study area. This research was undertaken to obtain a more integrated scenario of the relationship between the different micro and macro landscape changes, the prehistoric occupations in the area, the sources of raw materials, and the loca tions used for the different stages of the production processes. To accomplish these goals, the present geoarchaeological fieldwork focused on a systematic survey of a 5 km wide area encircling KPS-75 in order to map and sample the different natural parameters such as topography, rock types, soil, vegetation, as well as the water systems and sources. All the survey data will be integrated into a GIS database. The KPS-75 site is located in a geomorphologicaliy dynamic landscape that was developed across gen tly folded and faulted, mostly calcareous bedrock. The present landscape is characteristically erosional where incision and cutting by drainage is the major geomorphic process affecting the present landscape. Some mudflat depositions are also commonly found along the flat wadi bottoms, where sparse natural veg etation can also be observed. The general landscape relief varies from low to moderate in most of the study area. The topography of the area surrounding the site varies in elevation from a few meters below 900 masl in the east, near the Desert Highway, and to a maxi mum elevation of about 1,050 masl to the northeast ern side of the site. KPS-75 rises more than 40 m above the Wadi Shou har bed. The site receives annual rainfall of 50-150 mm, of which the majority falls in the winter months from January to March, in some years partly as snow. Most of the winter rainfall flows through ephemeral drainage conditions. Most of the drainage stream courses are directed ultimately east or northwest. Wadi al Abie'd is the principal such wadi, and it exhibits well developed incised meanders. Drainage in the south east corner of the area is to the northeast. Drainage has been strongly influenced locally by fracturing, in cluding faulting (with a northwest-southeast fault sys 21A1-Naharetal. 2009. 22A1-Naharetal. 2009.</page><page sequence="24">528 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 tern), which has caused linear valleys to develop along sections of several wadis. The area is dominated by a joint system and faulting with predominant northwest southeast trend, and the present geomorphic process es are very much controlled by this system. The rock outcrops in the area are mostly of sedimen tary origin and are Upper Cretaceous, Lower Tertiary, and Pleistocene to recent in age.23 The stratified se quence consists, for the most part, of shallow marine carbonates of various facies with some bituminous lay ers and associated chert and phosphatic beds or lenses. Volcanic igneous rocks, mapped as basalt, are assigned a Pleistocene age based on the study of Heimbach and Nuseibeh.24 Superficial deposits, which cover large areas, are Pleistocene to recent in age. The exposed lithological units in the area can be summarized as follows, in increasing age order:25 soil, alluvium, and wadi gravels; fluviatile and lacustrine gravels; basalt; Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation (Maastrichtian Paleocene); Al Hisa Phosphorite Formation (Campa nian Maastrichtian); Amman Silicified Limestone For mation (Santonian-Campanian); Wadi Umm Ghudran Formation (Santonian). The preliminary results of this ongoing geoarchaeo logical investigation can be summarized as follows: 1. The present landscape is the result of recent changes (post-Middle Holocene) that have led to the exposure of the cultural sequence in the wadi. The geoarchaeological section along the Wadi Shouhar shows that the wadi has witnessed many depositional phases through the Middle Holocene, which was then followed by an inci sion and erosion phase represented by the wadi bed cut. 2. The exposed stratigraphy indicates an occupa tional history in the wadi, which may extend back to the Middle Pleistocene. 3. Flint is the major rock type, which was used by the inhabitants of KPS-75 for the manufacturing of stone tools. There are more than six major exposures of most of the varieties of flint in less than a 5 km area around the site. KARAK RESOURCES PROJECT 200g Gerald L. Mattingly, Johnson Bible College, and James H. Pace, Elon University, report: The Karak Resources Project (KRP) conducted its fifth season of fieldwork in 2009; the project fo cus is a multidisciplinary investigation of the Karak plateau, which overlooks the eastern escarpment of the Dead Sea in central Jordan. After its pilot season in 1995, KRP conducted fieldwork on three fronts: (1) excavation of the fort of Khirbat al-Mudaybi' as a case study in resource utilization; (2) regional ar chaeological survey to locate new sites and monitor changes to sites documented by earlier projects; and (3) regional scientific studies on a variety of cultural and environmental topics. The KRP has focused on two pivotal questions: how have occupants of central Jordan's Karak plateau "made a living" with available resources on the desert fringe, and how have these strategies changed over time? The excavation of Khirbat al-Mudaybi', a strategi cally located fort in the southeastern corner of ancient Moab, serves as an excellent case study in resource utilization. It was originally built and occupied to ward the end of Iron II and used sporadically in the Roman, Late Byzantine-Early Islamic, Middle Islam ic, and Late Islamic periods. On the east, Khirbat al Mudaybi' overlooks a geological fault known as Fajj al-'Usaykir, which extends generally northwest from the eastern desert toward the ancient town of Karak. The Fajj served as a natural corridor connecting the desert and fertile interior of the plateau. From its stra tegic location, occupants of this fort monitored both hostile and commercial traffic entering and leaving the plateau. In addition to providing new informa tion about the settlement history of the Karak region, excavation has recovered artifacts and ecofacts that reflect specific domestic, industrial, and commercial activities. The fort (with a massive four-chamber gate, walls, and interval and corner towers) illustrates how the Iron II builders developed this hilltop into a stra tegic military and commercial position, which was remodeled in Byzantine and Islamic times as a way station for caravans (khan). During the 2009 field season, excavation in 11 squares in three archaeological fields (fields A, B, and D) added significantly to what KRP learned about the Iron II fort in earlier seasons. In field A, excavations along the northern perimeter wall confirmed the pres ence of a casemate system of fortifications. The team also learned more about modifications made to the fort's interior during the Late Byzantine-Early Islamic period. In field B, excavation of the four-chambered gate (which opens into the Fajj through an impressive entrance with benches on either side) revealed that the north side of this gate complex either was never finished or had been quarried to build later struc tures (fig. 11). From a secondary context in the gate 23Shawabkehl991. 24Heimbach and Nuseibeh 1965. 25Shawabkehl991.</page><page sequence="25">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 529 Fig. 11. Khirbat al-Mudaybi'. View through the field B gateway, looking west. area, KRP recovered a small fragment of a limestone relief, which might depict figures in a procession. The search for parallels to this image continues. In field D, excavation in various structures of the fort's north western corner yielded evidence of domestic activity (e.g., loomweights, an abundance of late Iron II pot tery, grindstones, numerous animal bones, a broken stone pendant). The team uncovered a doorway and staircase that gave access to a tower in the fort's north western corner; this work helps fill in details concern ing the site's overall layout. The small number of objects and pottery recovered in 2009, as well as certain architectural indications, point to a relatively short period of occupation toward the end of the Iron Age. Nevertheless, the stratigraphic excavation of Mudaybi' provides an opportunity to de fine the pottery styles from this late Iron II site, and it offers a window on ceramic traditions from the later Byzantine and Islamic periods. The collection and ongoing analysis of faunal and archaeobotanical ma terials will provide insights into the ancient economy and environment. KRP's regional archaeological survey team contin ued work begun by the Miller-Pinkerton survey that was conducted in 1978, 1979, and 1982. The purpose of that earlier, large-scale survey was to locate, record, and date evidence of ancient occupational sites on the Karak plateau, from Wadi al-Mujib to Wadi al-Hasa. In its detailed study of the plateau's southeastern region, KRP has now added more than 150 sites to the Miller Pinkerton list of443 sites. The recovery of information about all of the region's sites remains a high priority, since the Karak plateau?like much of Jordan?is ex periencing rapid population growth and development. In 2009, members of the survey located and docu mented ancient roads and other ancient features in the vicinity of Khirbat al-Mudaybi'. They focused their attention on the relation between roads and water management (e.g., wells, cisterns, channels). To date, regional scientific studies have focused on Bedouin and village economies, water resources, soil science, and geology. In 2009, team members focused on the region's soils, topography (through GIS applica tions) , ancient roads, and water resources. They com pleted their studies of the Karak regional soil types and surface geology. This was a multiseason effort that will produce a useful publication on soils and topography, including drainage patterns and line-of-sight studies. The study identified the sections of the plateau that have the best soils and those that hold the least agricul tural potential. It gives special attention to the nature of loess deposits in and around Mudaybi', since this is</page><page sequence="26">530 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 an important aspect of site-formation processes. Team members also collected specimens of the raw materials used to construct the fort of Khirbat al-Mudaybi' and neighboring sites?mosdy varieties of limestone, basalt, and chert. KRP plans to resume fieldwork in the Karak region and to shed more light on the occupational his tory of Mudaybi' and neighboring sites. KHIRBAT AL-BALTj' Friedbert Ninow, Theologische Hochschule Frie densau, reports: Khirbat al-Balu' is situated on the northern edge of the central Moabite plateau/al-Karak plateau east of the Dead Sea at the mouth of Wadi al-Balu', which continues on into Wadi ash-Shkefeyat and eventually empties into Wadi al-Mujib. Khirbat al-Balu' is one of the largest sites in the area, as it covers an area of about 12,500 m2. The main features and visible remains of the site can be dated to the Iron Age (main and eastern parts of the site) and to the Mamluk period (western parts of the site). The massive remains of the Iron Age point to the specific representative character of the site during this period. A new research project at Khirbat al-Balu' was initi ated by Friedensau Adventist University (Germany) in 2008. While previous projects concentrated on the Iron Age strata, the focus of this initiative is on the overall occupational history of the site. An area of illicit digging to the east of the monumental Iron Age quseirwas used as the determining factor for the location of prospec tive squares. Many Nabataean-Roman pottery sherds were scattered over the surface; the various openings revealed wall lines and other architectural features. Excavation revealed a stone structure that has been tentatively interpreted as an altar. A closer look at the various building phases showed that, in its first phase, the altar consisted of a quadrangle of 3.20 x 3.20 x 3.30 x 3.10 m. The stones were carefully hewn and the side walls covered with plaster. In a second phase, the altar was enlarged slightly to the south and west and more extensively to the north and east. The area between the extensions was filled with fieldstones; the walls themselves consisted of hewn stones that were also covered with plaster. Some of the plaster fragments were colored. In a third phase, a stairway was added at the northern side of the altar and a small podium was built in front of the western wall. Ashes and bones were found in the immediate vicinity of the altar. The structure could be dated to the Nabataean-Roman pe riod based on the pottery associated with it. Various parallels at Petra, Khirbet et-Tannur, and other places attest to this type of Nabataean altar. 26Politis etal. 2009. In the vicinity of the podium, a basalt sculpture of a figure standing on a pedestal was discovered, but only the feet of the figure are preserved (fig. 12). The size of the pedestal is 28 x 16 x 12 cm. The sculpture, together with the pedestal, probably had a height of 70-80 cm. Based on the style and workmanship, this object is to be dated to the Iron Age, rather than to the Nabataean period. Since there are not many sculp tures known from this area dating to the Iron Age, this discovery represents an important addition to the still small corpus of Moabite stone sculptures. The southern end of the podium consisted of a reused basalt stone with a relief that appears to have been placed here when the podium was built against the western side of the altar structure. From the re lief, it is clear that this stone originally must have been much larger. The origin of the stone could well be the quseirto the west, and the workmanship appears to be Iron Age. It resembles the kind of carving that is pres ent on volute capitals found at Khirbat al-Mudaybi' (just 40 km south of Balu'), Ramat Rahel in Israel, and elsewhere. These volute capitals are dated to the late eighth or early seventh centuries B.C.E. Thus, this carved stone appears to have been reused by the Na bataeans who rebuilt the Iron Age quseir and added an altar in front of it. The altar appears to be part of a larger temenos area that extended farther to the east. This temenos had a floor that consisted of carefully laid large, flat stones and a surrounding wall. The wall lines that enclose the area east of the quseir appeared to be of Iron Age ori gin. A probe at the southeastern corner revealed that this wall can be connected to a stone floor similar to the one found in the area of the altar. Pottery from this probe could be dated to the Nabataean-Roman period. It could well be that the Nabataeans reused an older Iron Age wall to create a temenos with an altar in front of the quseir. If our interpretation of the altar and the temenos is correct, this would be a second Nabataean sanctuary at Balu' in addition to the one in al-Qasr to the west. GHOR ES-SAFI Konstantinos D.

Survey Survey work conducted during these seasons was limited to making a new contour map joining the Tawahin es-Sukkar, Khirbet esh-Sheikh Tsa, and An Naq' sites. This will form the basis of a map of historic Zoara/Zughar and guide future land expropriation. Ard Ramleh-Galeb, first identified in 2007, was more closely investigated, and collections were made. A third road connecting the Ghor es-Safi with the Kerak pla teau was identified at Wadi Kunyiah: it was stepped, similar to the road at Wadi Sarmuj.27 Excavations Wadi Hamarash-Suweif. Two seasons of excavations were conducted during 2008 and 2009 at the newly discovered site of Wadi Hamarash-Suweif, located on an extended plateau northwest of the junction of the wadis el-Hasa and Hamarash-Suweif. The site consists of a PPN-B settlement extending over about half a hectare. Excavations revealed closely built stone hous es enclosed by a stone-built perimeter wall around the settlement on a roughly circular plateau. Thick walls, probably belonging to two-story build ings of the earlier period of the settlement, and thin walls separating rooms within trapezoidal buildings with rounded corners were revealed. Smaller rooms, possibly storage rooms, were connected to larger ones via narrow openings, closely resembling architecture found at Beidha. Area III is an open place that may be a courtyard with small storage areas to the east and west, which communicated via narrow doorways. A 1 m wide passageway, which may be interpreted as a road, leads to the central courtyard. During the 2009 season, excavations continued in areas I and II (loci 1 and 13) and were completed to a depth of more than 2 m, revealing ashy deposits and many stone tools, in cluding dozens of arrowheads. The most impressive architectural discovery was a 13 m2 building (area IV) in the center of the settle ment. Its construction, with carefully selected flat slab stones, differed from other buildings on the site, and it is preserved to a height of more than 1.60 m. The building has three entranceways on three of the cor ners, and three narrow openings (windows?) on the western side. In contrast with other building and room plans unearthed on the site, the area IV structure is the only one that is square-shaped. The preliminary 0 10cm Fig. 12. Pedestal with feet of sculptured figure from Khir bat al-Balu'. conclusion is that there were three different house owners and two or three architectural phases. A large number of lithics were found, including points, borers, tanged and serrated tools, and sickle blades. It is very significant that more than 500 ground stone tools were discovered during our excavations, as well as some 400 collected from the surface of the site. A large number of open- and closed-shaped bowls and basins were also found. Other interesting finds includ ed pierced ground stones, two bone borers, pierced marine shells for a necklace, marble figurines, and a bone ring. Numerous millstones indicate extensive food preparation and cultivation of cereals, presum ably on the plateau, with its easy access to fresh water from the wadi. Soil samples were taken for analysis, which will be part of an environmental study along with the abundance of animal bones recovered from well-stratified contexts in areas I and II. A corresponding site has been excavated on a ter race at the southeastern bank of the Wadi al-Hasa, which has similar architecture, PPN-B flint tools and pierced ground stones.28 Considering that the wadi would have been at a much higher level, and the waters would have flowed past both these sites, it is probable that they had very close relations. Khirbet esh-Sheikh Isa. Excavations at Khirbet esh Sheikh Tsa were continued during 2008 in trenches II and VIII from the previous 2006-2007 season,29 re vealing sequences of architecture and occupation from the Abbasid (eighth century CE.) to the Mamluk (ca. 15th century CE.) periods. 27Politisetal. 2007. 28 Peterson 2009. 29Politis et al. 2007.</page><page sequence="28">532 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 The most significant architectural phasing was the establishment of the history of a small paved street leading through an arched, 1.82 m wide entrance in the north-south Wall 2 (fig. 13). This 1.6 m wide ashlar sandstone wall has a projecting room to the west, just north of the small archway, which suggested that this might be a city wall with towers. However, the relatively narrow width of the archway meant that this was not the main entrance through this wall, and small-scale excavations in this area in 200430 could not fully clarify the function of either Wall 2 or the archway. A paved sandstone street was identified in trench II, extending more than 41 m to the east from the archway, into trench VIII. Excavations were not made beneath the paving slabs, so the construction date of the street remains unclear. Two sandstone columns still in situ indicate that this was a colonnaded street. To the west of the archway, a narrow lane or perhaps internal corridor was paved with a mosaic of plain white limestone tesserae. Trench VII has an earlier east-west ashlar wall (Wall 11) that continued to be used throughout the Medieval period. As with Wall 2, it survives to about 3 m (nine courses) above its original associated floor. This wall may belong to the same phase as the paving slabs and construction of Wall 2, but it is unlikely to be a south ern return of that wall, since it is a different width. It forms the southern wall of a building with a mosaic pavement decorated with pomegranates and florets in alternating interlaced squares and circles. Scattered on the mosaic surface were marble fragments. The paved road in trench II appears to continue along the southern face of Wall 11, and other marble columns were found in an abandonment phase over the paving slabs. The room paved with mosaic in trench VIII degrad ed in antiquity. Above the mosaic floor was a 10-15 cm deposit of nearly sterile soil, on which was an Abbasid occupation. Above this was an adobe brick collapse, followed by two successive phases of burnt floors and occupation. Preliminary analysis of these phases sug gests they date to the early Ayyubid period. Above the second burning and collapse, a 15th-century C.E. courtyard (excavated in 2006-2007), with tabuns and low adobe brick corrals, implies that this was a modest Mamluk-period house. Some of the more interesting finds of the season included a clay "kiln-tripod" used for stacking pot tery bowls inside a kiln, a finely carved and decorated bone comb, a stone pebble painted as an anthropo morphic figure, two pottery sherds inscribed in Kufic Arabic, and perhaps most remarkable, a copper alloy oil lamp refiller. Excavations at Khirbet esh-Sheikh Tsa clearly need to be continued on a larger scale to reveal the complete plan of the site and fully understand the function of the architecture. However, the depth of the deposits, the wealth of the finds within them, and the extent of the site require more substantial support than is currently available. Furthermore, a systematic con servation program including finds and architecture is imperative. Therefore, it was decided that excavations would not resume during 2009, to instead complete the post-excavations studies and publish the prelimi nary results. Post-Excavation Studies Work began on study of the excavation finds dur ing 2008-2009 concentrating on pottery (Tony Grey), small finds (Politis), and animal bones (Louise A. Mar tin) with support from the Palestine Exploration Fund, and on chipped and ground stone (Georgia Tampako poulou) from the Aegean University. The committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund also agreed to publish a monograph of all the work done to date. Exhibition Many of the objects from the excavations at Ghor es Safi will be on display in several exhibition cases in the new Museum at the Lowest Place on Earth located at Deir 'Ain 'Abata, near Safi, as of 2010.31 WADI ABU TULAYHA AND NEOLITHIC DAM SURVEY IN THE JAFR BASIN Sumio Fujii, Kanazawa University, reports: Our research project in the Jafr Basin started in 1998 with a view to tracing the process of pastoral no madization in the southern Levant. Since then, we have investigated a dozen archaeological sites spanning the four millennia from the PPN-B to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Among those was Wadi Abu Tulay ha, discovered in our 2001-2002 winter survey32 and continuously investigated since the first field season in the spring of 2005. The series of investigations showed that the site served as a middle-late PPN-B agropasto ral outpost for early transhumants who derived from a farming community to the west.33 This finding enabled us to postulate that PPN-B transhumance paved the way to pastoral nomadism in the subsequent periods. The investigations also revealed that the outpost was accompanied by a barrage for basin irrigation, two mi nor wadi barriers for supplementary water storage, and 30Politis etal. 2005. 31Politis 2009. 32 Fujii 2002; Fujii and Abe 2008. 33 Fujii 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2008.</page><page sequence="29">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 533 Fig. 13.

Paved street and arched gateway in the north-south Wall 2. a large cisternlike feature.34 It appears that the combi nation of the outpost and such a well-organized water supply system first enabled the early transhumants to penetrate into the arid periphery. The summer campaign of 2008, the sixth and fi nal field season at the site, was devoted to a series of complementary operations to make its overall picture clearer.35 To begin with, the continued excavation of the main body of the outpost confirmed that it began with a tripartite structural complex nested in a large pit, and that it dates back to the first half of MPPN-B. Thus, it is conceivable that contrary to the traditional perspective, transhumance in southern Jordan began soon after sheep and goats were domesticated either locally or externally. The earliest complex yielded a certain number of heavy-duty digging tools, stone vessels, game boards, cosmetic palettes, bone imple ments, and snail adornments, in addition to grinding tools and chipped-flint implements. Remarkable finds included a small anthropomorphic figurine made of fine-textured limestone, which may represent an ante cedent to the 'Ain Ghazal plaster statues (fig. 14). ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^ Fig. 14.

TUTTLE [AJA 114 The 2008 summer field season also addressed the is sues of the date and function of the cisternlike feature that was first found and tested in the previous season. The excavation proved that it was a large-scale, semi subterranean masonry structure measuring about 15 m in total length, about 4-5 m in width, and up to about 2 m in depth. The maximum capacity was estimated to be about 40-50 m3, a sufficient volume to sustain a small group of transhumants for a few months. Post Neolithic finds were rarely recovered; instead, PPN-B artifacts, such as naviform cores and blades, occurred consistently throughout fill layers, to say nothing of floor deposits. A few 14C dates corroborated that as with the other three water catchment facilities, it was constructed in combination with the outpost. As for the function, evidence for waterproofing work was newly found, in addition to a water-driving channel and a dredge tank. There is no doubt that the structure served as a cistern for providing drinking water to the neighboring MPPN-B-LPPN-B agropastoral outpost. The investigation of the cistern also provided a key to tracing the process of pastoral nomadization. What attracted our attention was that, while the lower fill layers consisted exclusively of fallen stones and fluvial/ aeolian deposits, the middle and upper fill layers also contained a few simple hearths with heavy-duty grind ing tools beside them. This contrast implies that the cistern was reused as a temporary shelter for a small mobile population after it went out of use as a cistern. The series of 14C dates indicates that the functional conversion took place immediately after the outpost was abandoned. Of interest is the origin of those who built a fire in the half-buried cistern. They may be defined as the first group of pastoral nomads in the Jafr Basin in the sense that they evacuated the fixed outpost, and instead encamped at the disused cistern. Large-scale climatic deterioration most likely caused both the reduction in water collection in the cistern and the decline in opportunistic agriculture within the flooded area of the basin-irrigation barrage sys tem; both factors may have helped trigger a shift from transhumance to pastoral nomadism. Given this, the correlation between pastoral nomadization and the water supply problem at a remote outpost would be worth testing further in a broader context. A brief survey in the 2009 summer field season was designed as the first step in addressing this challeng ing issue.36 We reexamined a total of seven PPN-B wa ter catchment facilities already known in and around the Jafr Basin: four at Wadi Abu Tulayha, two at Wadi 36 Fujii (forthcoming). Ruweishid ash-Sharqi, and one at Wadi Badda. The retrospective survey also newly registered two likely examples at Jabal Jahayra. What interested us was that, whereas the western edge of the basin nearer the PPN-B core area contains simple wadi barriers only, the outpost area to the east includes cisterns and basin-irrigation barrage systems as well. This contrast probably means that PPN-B transhumants tried to bring a mixed economy established at their mother settlements into their remote outposts, or rather that the PPN-B transhumance first took form through transplanting such a risk-diversifying, multifaceted economy. The existence of multiple water catchment facilities at Wadi Abu Tulayha can also be best under stood within this context. Given this perspective, it is highly likely that the failure of the catchment systems led to the collapse of the PPN-B transhumance system and the beginning of pastoral nomadization. We are planning to start a new project to explore the issue again in the Jafr Basin. 'AYN GHARANDAL SURVEY AND PRESERVATION PROJECT Robert Darby, University of Missouri-Columbia, and Erin Darby, Duke University, report: The 'Ayn Gharandal Archaeological Project be gan with a short, exploratory season in 2009. 'Ayn Gharandal is located about 100 km north of the Gulf of Aqaba and some 40 km southwest of Petra on the eastern edge of the Wadi Arabah. The presence of a spring in the nearby Wadi Gharandal, which still flows abundantly today, presumably served as the reason for human occupation at the site. 'Ayn Gharandal and its surroundings were visited by many of the early 20th-century explorers to the region. Alois Musil was the first to record the ruins of a Late Roman castellum at 'Ayn Gharandal. Recent investiga tions at the site revealed that two rooms of a previously unidentified Roman bath complex had fallen victim to illegal digging. As a result, a portion of the build ing's architectural remains were unearthed, including several well-preserved and heavily plastered walls, ex posing them to the extreme environmental conditions of the Wadi Arabah. Exposure of the structure placed it at risk to both the elements and to potential stone robbing of the well-cut ashlar blocks. The goals of the 2009 'Ayn Gharandal Survey and Preservation Project were to establish a permanent and expandable 200 m2 site grid; to collect and record all material culture from the surface at the site; to record</page><page sequence="31">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 535 all visible architectural remains; to produce a prelimi nary state plan and three-dimensional models of 'Ayn Gharandal; and to preserve the threatened remains exposed by illicit digging. Results Architecture. The survey recorded the remains of a fort, a bathhouse, a probable aqueduct system, and one wall of a possible domestic structure. The fort mea sures about 40 x 40 m and appears to follow the typical pattern of a Late Roman castellum, with four projecting corner towers. We also recorded a gate in the north ern wall. The two looted rooms of the bathhouse were documented, as well as a third room or courtyard to the west. Although the southern room of the bath was badly damaged, the northern room survived to the level of the arch springers for its vaulted ceiling. Moreover, the large number of burnt hypocaust tiles and flue pipes suggests that the northern and southern rooms were related to the heating system of the bath. Future excavation of these rooms will help clarify their function. We also observed a previously unrecorded aqueduct system, measuring about 190 m long and about 0.78 m wide. The system stretches from the east wall of the fort into the mouth of the wadi. Finally, one wall of an additional structure is visible to the south of the bathhouse. Pottery collected from the structure indicates a possible domestic function. Ceramic Analysis. During the 2009 season, 1,344 ce ramic sherds were collected, including pottery (n=668), lamps (n=3), pipes (n=410), and tiles (n=263). Most of the pottery consisted of coarse wares dating from the Early Roman-Early Byzantine periods (second through fourth/fifth centuries C.E.). The majority appears to have been produced in the Petra region; however, at least 23 sherds were identified as Aqaba ware, originat ing from ancient Aila on the Red Sea. Additionally, a very small number of imported fragments were iden tified. The surface pottery collected suggests that oc cupation peaked during the Nabataean/Early Roman through Byzantine periods, at which time the site was supplied primarily with ceramics from the major re gional production centers. Site Preservation. The project assessed the two looted rooms of the bath for short- and long-term preserva tion. Because the rooms still possessed fine plaster and remains of vaulting, we reburied the structure in an effort to preserve the site until a more permanent solution can be attained. In 2010, further options for consolidating these rooms will be explored. KHIRBAT EN-NAH AS Thomas Levy and Mohammad Najjar, University of California, San Diego, report: The Khirbat en-Nahas project is carried out as a re search expedition and field school of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The principal aims of the 2009 season focused on examining the organi zation and control of Iron Age metal production at the site. To achieve this, two main areas were excavat ed: a monumental building (area R) that had been provisionally dated to the 10th century B.C.E. (using high-precision radiocarbon dates from the 2006 exca vations) and a building complex in the most southern area of Khirbat en-Nahas (area W). The new area R excavations revealed a six-room building complex surrounding a rectangular court yard. Five major strata were identified in this area. The earliest stratum (R3) dates to the early part of the 10th century B.C.E., while the main building phase at the site (stratum R2B) is attributed to the late 10th cen tury B.C.E. One of the rooms was found with a num ber of ceramic vessels that can be reconstructed and weapons made of iron. A beautifully preserved set of 10 steps leading to a second floor was found on the right-hand side of the building inside a small room that served as the stairwell. An impressive cut-stone bench or podium was found on the north face of the build ing that may have served as a seat or dais to observe metal production activities in the vicinity of the area R building. This is the largest (ca. 13 x 15 m) building yet found at Khirbat en-Nahas. The size of this build ing, its central location at the site, the monumental "seat" or "podium," and the assemblage of artifacts that relate to prestige may indicate that this was the residence of those who controlled metal production during the late 10th century B.C.E. In the early 10th century B.C.E. strata, below the courtyard associated with the monumental building, a well-preserved smelt ing and metalworking horizon was found. The most important discovery here was a complete Iron Age smelting furnace?the first of its kind from the south ern Levant. The excavations here were supervised by Marc Beherec. Area W was selected for investigation because this portion of Khirbat en-Nahas had never been excavat ed. Surface remains of collapsed walls indicated that this building complex could include numerous rooms, whose function could only be determined by careful excavation. Stretching over an area of about 20 x 45 m, two separate building complexes were discovered. Building Complex 1 consisted of three storage rooms with walls preserved to more than 2 m in height that lead into a courtyard unit that was surround by seven small rooms. Many of these rooms were delineated by carefully constructed pillars. On the north wall of the courtyard, a large monolith (more than 1.5 m ht.) was found that may be interpreted as a standing</page><page sequence="32">536 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 stone. In Room 8, a small Egyptian "Potaikos" figurine was found. Potaikos is the dwarf god who symbolized good luck and was the son of Ptah, the patron god of skilled craftsmen and architects. How this figurine re lates to metal production at Iron Age Khirbat en-Nahas remains to be investigated. The second building com plex was also organized around a rectangular court yard. Here, eight rooms were found, many of which contained evidence of domestic activities, including a tabun or oven for cooking. The function of these two building complexes is under investigation. This area was supervised by Adolfo Muniz. To complement the UCSD study of Iron Age metal production in Jordan's Faynan region, a small sound ing was made at the site of Khirbat al-Guwayba. Here, three archaeological strata were found, which include modern Bedouin, Nabataean/Roman, and an Iron Age horizon above virgin soil. We also carried out test excavations at one of the Iron Age "pit mines" discov ered in the vicinity of Khirbat en-Nahas. Both sound ings were supervised by Erez Ben-Yosef. Finally, as part of our UCSD-California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technol ogy (Calit2) research with digital archaeology, a new helium balloon stereo digital photography system was deployed. The new system allowed the team to produce large-scale georeferenced photographs of the excavations to facilitate mapping of architecture during the course of the expedition (fig. 15). The system also enabled the team to record daily aerial photographs of the excavations to produce time-lapse photography of the work, panorama photographs of the site, and photogrammetric mapping of the site. The "blueprint" plans for this system will be made available online in the near future. This project was supervised by David Hernandez. Other digital archae ology work was carried out with a 3D LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) laser scanner with the aim of carrying out architectural research and conservation of the site. This work was supervised by Tom Wypch. BROWN UNIVERSITY PETRA UPPER MARKET PROJECT Susan Alcock, Michelle Berenfeld, Ian Straughn, and Christopher Tuttle, Brown University, report: The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World (JIAAW) at Brown University launched a new archaeological initiative in Petra during the 2009 season. The project is located in the area of the city center known as the Upper Market. The Upper Market lies at the eastern end of the elevated terrace that extends along the south side of the colonnaded street. Also located on the south ter race, from east to west, are the Middle Market, the Petra Garden and Pool Complex (formerly the Lower Market), and the Petra Great Temple (formerly the Petra Southern Temple). Exploring the spatial and social relationship of these adjacent complexes was one motivation for our work, as was a desire to better understand the nature of the Upper Market itself. The Upper Market is an approximately square, rela tively level area, located at the start of the colonnaded street, which is marked by a set of stairs. These stairs, and the associated shops below the "market" at street level, were excavated under the direction of Zbigniew Fiema as part of the Petra Roman Street Project, spon sored by the American Center of Oriental Research in 1998. The Upper Market is further distinguished by the extant portion of a single column, which lies fallen near the northern edge of the square. A single 5 x 5 m test trench, set at the hypothesized northwest corner of the Upper Market precinct, was opened during this inaugural season as a means of accomplishing several specifically targeted goals (fig. 16). The first goal was to try to confirm the presence of a colonnade currently hypothesized to lie along the western boundary. A second goal was to determine if any evidence was preserved to indicate that the Up per Market area might have contained a paved floor. The final goal was to begin to explore the depth of soil deposits in this area, in order to design a research methodology for future seasons. A surface collection over the area of the trench was conducted before excavation was begun in the east half of the trench; all the removed soil was screened. The work in the eastern half of the trench was stopped when remnants of shattered, sandstone floor pavers were found in situ. The western half of the trench was then excavated down to the same level, and a random selection of excavated material was screened. More shattered pavers and rubble were found, and the top of the eastern face of a north-south wall visible in the west balk was exposed. No remnants of a mortar bedding for the paving stones were evident in the test trench. The depth of the topsoil deposit varied in the trench as the surface sloped from the south (ca. 0.37 m) to the north (ca. 0.04 m). The entire matrix of this deposit was generally uniform in color and consistency. Details about it and the material culture recovered from it is included in the forthcoming preliminary report. The initial trench was then expanded by an addi tional 2.5 m to the west in order to expose the width of the north-south wall; its preserved height was not determined by the excavation this season. Interest ingly, unlike our experience in the eastern portion of the trench, the soil deposits in this area immediately to the west of the north-south wall were found to be nearly devoid of material culture.</page><page sequence="33">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 537 Fig. 15.

TUTTLE [AJA 114 The bonding of this north-south wall with another extending to the east-west suggests we may have de fined the northwestern corner, and the western bound ary, of the Upper Market, but this conclusion requires additional confirmation. The presence of floor pavers in the trench establishes that the northwestern sector of the Upper Market was paved with sandstone flag stones, at least during a late phase of its history. The pavers appear to vary in both size and orientation; in sufficient examples were preserved to determine any clear patterning in construction, though the absence of any mortar bedding suggests that the paving was dry laid. The chronological phasing of these architectural elements cannot yet be determined, based on the data from this single trench. During the final cleaning and documentation of the trench, some patterns were identified among the rubble and a section of apparently seriated flagstones. These features have been identified as possible graves, later inserted into the area. This possibility remains to be explored in future seasons. Finally, owing to the poor state of preservation of the floor pavers, and in order to conserve the integrity of the area, the trench was backfilled. Brown University hopes to continue work in the Up per Market area as part of the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project (beginning in 2010). The area's prime location in the city center, and its tantalizing proximity to many major monuments, makes it an at tractive candidate for further investigations aimed at shedding light on the diachronic history of urban or ganization at Petra. petra: jabal nmayr Laurent Tholbecq, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, reports: A survey of the Jabal Nmayr high place, and its ac cess way, was carried out in 2009 as a parallel study to our work at the Obodas sanctuary above the Wadi Nmayr.37 This project, funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is part of the French archaeological mission in Petra, directed by Christian Auge. The only existing sketch of this complex was published in 1908 by Dalman.38 Seventeen unpublished rock-cut monu ments have been recorded on the stairway accessing the high place. They are distributed in 10 spots, along the eastern flank of the mountain, from the northern access of the Wadi Nmayr to the summit of the Jabal Nmayr. Of particular interest are a monumental rock cut niche framed in an elaborated architectural setting (JN1), two associated decorated niches with their rock cut betyls (JN6), a representation of an armed charac ter (JN8), and a rock-cut chamber associated with what can be interpreted as a raised platform (MWTB) (JN9). The high place has suffered major damage since a visit paid in 2006: all the built structures have been totally destroyed by robbers (fig. 17). Similarly, some arches from the vaulted cistern have collapsed since Dalman's expedition. Nevertheless, a new plan has been drawn, since the sketched map published in 1908 showed sev eral errors in terms of scale and relative orientation of the remains. The 2009 description includes important new information about a quarry on the southern third of the summit and the ceramic dumps concentrated in the middle section. Located on the northern edge of the Jabal, the high place overlooks Petra. Walls de fining a square of about 11.5 x 13.0 m are inserted into a secondary 23 x 15 m rock-cut esplanade. This open space was similarly limited by walls on its western, northern, and eastern sides. Test soundings would be needed to determine if a shrine existed in the center of the platform, similar to that known at Khirbet et Tannur. The interpretation of the rock-cut features is particularly difficult: stairs and recesses are connected to possible platforms, and although the identification is tempting, the evidence to consider them as sacred platforms is lacking. PETRA, WADI MATAHA David J. Johnson, Brigham Young University, reports: The major objective of the seventh excavation sea son of the Brigham Young University Wadi Mataha project was to test the theory generated from the pre vious excavations that lithics, pottery sherds, fossils, and other small objects were used by the Nabataeans as votive offerings in ritual situations and sometimes decorated with the images of Nabataean, Egyptian, or Graeco-Roman deities. Six areas were selected for excavation: Site 14, an open-air shrine; Site 15, the large platform in front of Tomb BD 676; Site 16, a rock-cut Nabataean tomb with 12 loculi; Site 17, a 1 x 6 m sondage in front of a group of west-facing Nabataean niches; Site 18, a Naba taean rock-cut high place with an open-air triclinium; and Site 19, a 2 x 3 m trench in front of a Nabataean petroglyph. Site 14 is an east-facing, open-air shrine with one main niche and at least three associated, subsidiary niches. Four test squares were excavated (areas 14A, 37Dalman 1908, no. 285; Tholbecq 2007; Tholbecq et al. 2008. 38Dalmanl908, fig. 133.</page><page sequence="35">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 539 Fig. 17. Destroyed ancient structures at the Jabal Nmayr high place. B, C, and D). Artifacts recovered include a heavy con centration of ceramics, lithics, and worked stone. Ce ramics from the site consist predominately of red wares with tan, black, and orange slips, and includes Naba taean light red and dark red painted fine wares as well as imported terra sigillata. A small amount of coarse brown ware and crude black ware, possibly Edomite, was also recovered. Identified forms include cooking pots, jars, juglets, unguentaria, bowls and cups with ring bases, and a large concentration of jar handles in area 14D. Other materials include 23 lithic cores, 283 lithic flakes, 13 quartz pebbles, 2 microburins, 1 awl, 3 blades, 4 bladelets, 21 microliths, and 3 fossils. Site 15 is located in the open area directly east of the large tomb (Tomb 676) in Briinnow and von Do maszewski's survey.39 The area was divided into 5 x 5 m squares aligned with the wall lines and with the center of square 15A at the southeast corner of the structure. Squares A, B, C, G, and H were excavated this season, revealing a large ashlar-built platform sit ting on bedrock. Two levels of construction were noted in the platform area. The upper level is more roughly built, with flat, irregular blocks and less leveling of the floor. In 14B, east of the platform, a roughly built ramp leads up to the platform area from an unexca vated stairway that leads to the tomb from the wadi bed. A lower level of construction has a perfectly level floor of cut flat ashlar sandstone slabs. Ceramics asso ciated with the strata in square 15A indicate a period of use from the late first century B.C.E. to the late first century C.E., based on both Nabataean light red and dark red painted fine ware plate and bowl fragments found in the levels. Significant finds include a carved bone Dhushara figurine and a coin of Malichus II. The excavated squares indicate a large, solid platform forming a plaza in front of Tomb 676. Site 16 is located in the northern drainage of the Wadi Mataha in the Jebel al Mudhlim region. It is a rock-cut tomb with 12 loculi elevated high above the wadi bed and is accessed by climbing 2 m up a rock wall using cut handholds into the entranceway. The rock-cut tomb chamber is 4.6 m wide, 6.5 m long, and 2.7 m high. This site was selected for excavations because it is likely that all soil deposits within the 39 Briinnow and von Domaszewski 1904, 374.</page><page sequence="36">540 DONALD R. KELLER AND CHRISTOPHER A. TUTTLE [AJA 114 loculi are wind blown, thus any material remains in them can be associated with the actual burials from the Nabataean period. The 12 loculi were designated A through L, beginning in the back of the chamber and lettering clockwise around the tomb. Loculi A and L, near the west wall, are oriented east-west, and B through Kare oriented north-south. The loculi are about 2.10 m long, 0.60 m wide, and 0.90 m deep. The remains of 41 adults, 9 adolescents, and 11 children were found in the tomb. Recovered ceramic sherds included black wares, red wares with tan, yellow, and black slips, fine red ware bowls and cups, Nabataean dark red painted thin ware plate, terra sigillata, Nabataean plain or ange ware bowls and plates, brown drip-painted jars, and a Hellenistic black ware fusiform unguentaria. Other finds included goat, snake, falcon, bird, and dog bones, a large number of lithics and lithic cores, fossils, a large quantity of wooden objects, including carved and painted images of Dhusares, textiles with blue bands, and wooden and faience beads. Overall, Site 16 represents a significant discovery in terms of Nabataean funerary practices at Petra because of the excellent preservation of organic materials. The wooden objects especially offer new insights into their use as ritual objects accompanying the dead into the afterlife. Site 16, based on the ceramic types present, was probably used from the last part of the first century B.C.E. until the end of the first century CE. Site 17isalx6m sondage excavated in front of a group of western-facing niches and betyls at the junc tion of the Wadi Mataha and the Sadd al-Maajan. All the Nabataean painted wares were of the light red on orange variety, indicating an early first-century CE. date for the surrounding features. A small Nabataean platform was uncovered below the niches; it was flat, diagonally dressed, and rock-cut. Site 18 is a rock-cut Nabataean high place triclinium isolated above the wadi bed at the junction of the Wadi Mataha and the Sadd al-Maajan. It measures 2.85 x 4.40 m. Because of its location, all the cultural material in the deposition represents actual use without any pos sibility of washed-down material. One stratigraphie unit was isolated above the bedrock: a fine, compacted, wind-blown red sand accumulated over the centuries but remixed every winter season. Pottery included a heavy concentration of red wares with tan and black slips, Nabataean fine light red painted ware plates, cups and bowls, everted rim jars, juglets with strap handles, and piriform unguentaria. This is consistent with an early first-century CE. date for the use of this area. Site 19 is located south of Site 16 on a large, sandy plateau above the main northern drainage of the Wadi Mataha. A 3 x 2 m test trench was excavated west of a bedrock outcrop below a carved Nabataean betyl with a triangular face. Ceramics were mainly red wares with tan slips and Nabataean dark red and light red painted bowl fragments from the late first century C.E. Below these strata, a roughly built wall of ashlar blocks with small rock chinking about 1 m in width, oriented northwest by southeast, was uncovered. GREATER PETRA REGION SURVEY Ulrich Hubner, University of Kiel, reports: Survey research undertaken by the University of Kiel in cooperation with the Naturhistorische Ge sellschaft, Nurnberg, during October 2009 provides the following new topographical information for the greater Petra region. Three hitherto unknown Early Bronze Age houses, obscured by large rock formations, were discovered in the southern part of the Umm Saisaban (or Sisiban or Saysaban) Early Bronze Age settlement. The structures are now integrated into the previously published map of the site.40 At the northeastern edge of Umm Saisa ban, the so-called city wall was almost completely de stroyed in 2008 by the construction of a modern path for tourists and hikers. Early Bronze Age Umm Saisa ban was partly fortified by walls and partly protected by the mountains and the cliffs leading down to Wadi Mirwan. Architecture within Umm Saisaban consists of scattered freestanding buildings and houses. The region around Ain ad-Debbe, located in the center of Wadi al-Qa', one of the southern tributaries of Wadi as-Sade, was also surveyed. On the north bank, above the wadi, the ruins of an EB I village were dis covered at Khirbet al-Debbe. The remains cover a flat area of approximately 20 x 50 m. Visible on the surface are the remains of four or five rectangular houses and three or four round huts. Very little surface pottery was discovered, and, with the exception of one Iron II sherd, all the pottery is of Early Bronze Age date. The remains of the contemporary Early Bronze Age cemetery were discovered 110 m east of the Khirbet ad-Debbe settlement. Single tombs are recognizable by small stone heaps on the surface. Unfortunately, recent plundering of the cemetery has taken place. On the western side of Wadi al-Qa' is a small tell without a local name and therefore called by the team Tell ad-Debbe. Surface evidence suggests that the site was occupied during EB I?II, Iron IIB, and the Late Roman and Ayyubid-Mamluk periods. 40 Lindner etal. 2001,287.</page><page sequence="37">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 541 HUMAYMA (ANCIENT HAWARA) M. Barbara Reeves, Ian Babbitt, Katie Cummer, Barbara Fisher, and Brian Seymour, Queen's Univer sity, report: In 2008, a new cycle of excavations was begun with the goal of investigating the character and extent of Hawara's Nabataean- and Roman-period civilian com munities and, more specifically, to see how the nature of these communities changed as the Roman military presence at Hawara evolved. During the first cam paign, we targeted four different areas around the pe rimeters of the fort where, on the basis of past probes and geophysical data, we hypothesized that we would find buildings dating from the Nabataean through Byzantine periods, as well as traces of the Via Nova Traiana or the earlier King's Highway (fig. 18). Field E077 had been excavated in 1989 to reveal a Roman bathhouse built over the foundations of a finely constructed Nabataean stone structure. Re mains of the Nabataean structure extended at least 1 m south of the bathhouse, and subsequent probes suggested that another Nabataean stone structure might be buried next to it. As two decades of excava tions had revealed that all other traces of Nabataean Hawara's nonhydraulic structures had been built over in later periods, we decided to reopen field E077 in 2008 to assess the extent of the Nabataean remains in this area. Selective excavation confirmed the presence of two different finely constructed Nabataean stone buildings. All the walls revealed by the probes had been robbed out, often so that only a single course of ashlars (or no ashlars) remained over the foun dation cobbles. Fill on the floors of the robbed-out structures suggests that the Nabataean buildings were dismantled contemporaneously with the construction of the Roman garrison's fort and bathhouse. Fill also suggests that part of the Roman bathhouse had gone out of use during the Byzantine-period renovations. Full excavation of this field is now scheduled for 2010 in order to reveal the full extent and character of the Nabataean structures and to trace the phasing of the bathhouse from the Roman through Byzantine (or Early Islamic) periods. Field El 28, immediately south of field El 25, consists of a small mound containing a buried mudbrick build ing. Excavations this season revealed the entrance to the building, two exterior walls, and portions of six rooms. The walls, which had multicourse cobble foun dations, were topped with an eclectic combination of quarried stone blocks and at least three different types of mudbricks. Since the ceramic evidence suggests that the building was constructed sometime between the third quarter of the first century CE. and the middle of the second century C.E., it is possible that it was built from recycled materials following the damage the site received around the time of the Roman annexa tion. More excavation is necessary to determine the function of the building, but the presence of a small room with a wide mudplaster bench is reminiscent of arrangements in Roman brothels. Field El 21, located about 100 m west of the Roman fort (El 16), was excavated in 2008. The results of previ ous probes had led us to hypothesize that it contained a Byzantine-period (fourth-early fifth centuries) vicus structure. Although the hypothesized structure was found, it had been so heavily robbed out (only por tions of two rectangular rooms remained) that little can be surmised about its function or plan. Two other structures were also found: a circular fieldstone enclo sure and a square platform constructed of flat cobbles laid in ashy gray mortar. The circular enclosure dated to after the abandonment of the rectangular structure and perhaps functioned as an animal pen. The plat form's construction predated that of the rectangular structure (although it was later incorporated into it). Given that the two best preserved sides of the platform measure 10 Roman feet x 10 Roman feet, and given that past research at the site suggests that the Roman foot (0.296 m) was only used in Roman-period con structions, this platform probably postdates the arrival of the Roman garrison. More excavation of the sur rounding context is necessary to determine the plat form's function, but it is possible that (1) it served as a raised tribunal for officers reviewing training drills on the military campus (see below), (2) it constitutes the remains of an altar, or (3) its flat top provided a base for the display of betyls or statues. Fields El29 and El30 are two related areas to the northwest of the Roman fort excavated to truth geo physical data collected in 2002, which had suggested that three buried linear constructions would be located in this area. It was hoped that one would be either the Roman Via Nova Traiana or the earlier King's High way. Excavation of 10 squares spanning more than 38 m east-west revealed a much more complicated stra tigraphy for this area than suggested by the geophys ics. Beneath the surface, most of this area is covered by a very hard, packed layer of soil full of calcareous concretions. This layer varied in thickness from 0.3 to 0.9 m and sometimes disappeared for several meters before resuming. On the eastern side of field El 29, this hard-packed soil stratum was overlaid by another stra tum consisting of dried-out plough furrows. Although the plough furrows do seem to have been detected by the geophysics, it now seems likely that the other two linear constructions, previously hypothesized to be discrete roads, are actuallyjust mirages resulting from overinterpreting changes in the thickness and pres</page><page sequence="38">542 DONALD R.

However, even though no obviously man-made road was found in fields El 29 or El30, the very hard natural soil layer throughout these areas would have provided excellent traction for the humans, animals, and wheeled vehicles bringing supplies to the fort and town or passing through Ha wara on the trade routes. The firm soil to the west of the fort was also ideally situated to serve as the military campus, the field where the garrison's daily drills took place. This natural layer of soil provided excellent trac tion and was conceivably used in ancient times for a variety of purposes, including roads, training grounds, parking lots, and building foundations. HUMAYMA Robert Schick, University of Bamberg, Germany, reports: A two-week season of archaeological excavations was conducted at the site of Humayma, in southern Jordan, in 2009. It focused on three of the five known Byzantine-period churches at the site. Three probes were dug in the CI01 Lower Church in the site's western center, which had been extensively excavated in 1991, 1992, and 1993 to answer specific questions about architectural phasing. The first probe was dug in the northern-side apse below the pavement level and confirmed that the northern-side apse and the central apse were constructed at the same time. A second probe, placed outside the southeastern corner of the church, uncovered a wall that clearly belonged to a pre-church phase building. The western portion of this pre-church wall had been removed during the construction of the east wall of the church. A third probe outside the southwest corner of the church uncovered dump layers filled with pottery and ani mal bones from the Nabataean period that were later cut through for the foundation courses of the south wall of the church. The row of rooms along the south side of the church proved to predate the church; their common north wall was partially cut into for the con struction of the south wall of the church. The CI 19 Upper Church in the far western area of the site was a small, single-apsed basilica, with side rooms flanking the apse to the north and south (fig. 19). Recent illicit digging had churned up a great deal of soil in the church, exposing some of the archi tectural features, which could be documented with minimal effort. The northeast area of the church was</page><page sequence="39">2010] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN, 2008 AND 2009 SEASONS 543 Fig. 19. Excavated northeast area of the CI 19 Upper Church at Humayma. exposed down to the elevated chancel and the pave ment in the north aisle and nave west of the chancel (see fig. 19). The pavements consisted of sandstone pavers. Excavation along the west wall of the church exposed a doorway, leading to uninvestigated rooms farther to the west. The floor of the church interior here consisted of leveled bedrock. The eastern portion of Church B126, in the eastern center of the site, had been built over in the 1960s by a building used as a barn. Recently, the thatched roof of the modern building had been removed, making it possible to work in the interior and document the architectural features of the church. The original flag stone pavement was partially preserved in the apse and to its west. One of the intact pavers in front of the apse covered an undisturbed, but empty, stone reliquary.
