<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY by Mary E. Clark. 2nd ed., 1979. W.B. Saunders Company (West Washing- ton Square, Philadelphia 19105). 665 p. $17.95. Contemporary Biology "attempts to present the subject matter of biology in a way which relates it to every individual." The textbook designed for the non- science major has seven units each "covering" a major field of biology. I question the relevancy of certain detailed sections of the text or figures to the targeted reader as is, but it is an excellent book even for the biology major. The book has the usual sections of summary, study exercises, and further readings. The study exercises are directly related to chapter contents and are useful evaluative devices. The "further readings" are well-chosen, at an appropriate level, and relevant. The author is to be commended for the direct simplicity of introductory statements in each chapter, e.g., "there are essentially two classes of organisms with respect to food requirements: those that can synthesize their own organic molecules and those that cannot" (p. 177). The quotations at the beginning of each chapter add a touch of elegance and a bit of history. Mnemonic clues throughout the text provide the reader with an easy route to a scientific vocabulary although the non-major will find it difficult to decide on what to remember. Certain parts of the book are outstanding. These include the sections on Cell Structure, organelles and functions, Homeostasis, Problems in Nutrition, Drugs, and Viruses and Cancer. They reveal the author's broad conceptual view of living things. A particularly good section on cost-benefit analysis in decision-making relates modern technologies to humanistic concerns. Origin of life and evaluation again (as biology textbooks go) is relegated to the end of the book contrary to the reviewers opinion that the most profound concept in biology should be at the beginning and the focal point of all other topics in biology. The figures and photographs are clear, accurate, explanatory and generally unencumbered by the host of detail other authors deem necessary. The colored plates, albeit at some distance from the text, provide a satisfying feature. Scientific instrumentation is related to text so a student conjoins rhetoric and process in science. Several disturbing features exist in the book. Chapter headings on the upper corner of left text pages are often distracting to the reader. They frequently appear to be figure headings where figures are immediately below. It is also somewhat disconcerting when special insertions such as on the Human Digestive System or Human Circulation "interrupt" the text. There is the usual anthropomorphism in a number of statements such as p. 187 "The mouth is designed for reception of food and initial maceration by the jaws." (Italics mine.) This book is a refreshing addition to the outpouring of biology textbooks in the last decade. Alfred Novak Stephens College Columbia, Missouri</page></plain_text>
