<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYLON Fourth Quarter, 1945 Vol. VI, No. 4 By RUSHTON COULBORN Determinism and Atomic Force ACH MOLECULE blindly runs," suggests A. N. Whitehead as a prelude to refuting the theory of mechanism. Physical matter, Whitehead believes, does not run blindly, purposelessly on a meaningless path of cosmic evolution. If we cannot discover and define a purpose inherent in the evolution of the cosmos, its things, entities, and creatures, that is perhaps because the concept of purpose is too much an anthropomorphic concept, suitable to the form of our own minds, but not a good represen- tation of cosmic reality; it is our old imaginative flight of creating God in man's image. There are many things in history, not only man's his- tory, but the history of all species, the geological history of the earth, the history of planets and stars as known to astronomy, which suggest that there is a method, a theme, and a coherent meaning in that total evolution. We cannot describe and comprehend it, either because our minds are not psycho-physically sufficiently developed to do so, or simply because we have not yet reached the culminating juncture of knowledge of the cosmos, which our minds are potentially able to achieve; we do not know which is the reason. The current Neo-Darwinian view of the ascent of species holds an element of what is called "chance" in its casuality. It is said that the species mutate at random; nobody knows why or how. But, as those random mutations occur, nature in the form of the physical environment permits those creatures which mutate in a manner adapted to the en- vironment to survive and multiply; it ruthlessly exterminates all the others. But is mutation random? Is it just chance that there emerge mu- tations which can survive? What is chance? Nobody knows. We are, therefore, entitled to doubt the reality of this unknown; dialectically, we are actually compelled to say that, if we did know the reality of 305</page><page sequence="2">PHYLON chance, it would not be chance. We may properly reject Bergson's elan vital, the various "wills" of Nietzche, Schopenhauer, and indeed of the theodiceans. These are pure speculations, and so merely mental exer- cises. But we may continue to doubt chance. Human history itself gives data which do not favor the negativism of chance. The Chinese, since at the latest the sixth century B.C., have firmly believed that history repeats itself in cycles, and for good and sufficient causes. The Indians, from about the same date, but less clearly, firmly and realistically have thought the same. The Egyptians had a glimmering of this idea, and so did the Greeks, for whom it was finally stated by Polybius. In our own society, G. B. Vico reached a like opinion at the end of the seventeenth century. Vico was a theodicean, but he made an instructive interposition between the will of God and outward events in the human sphere: this was the human mind. Vico thought that the human mind was of such a form that it must cause the events of the history of civilized societies to go always through the same general pattern of evolution - and then to start back at the beginning, perhaps endlessly (whatever that means). Vico's opinion is directly reflected by Sorokin at the present day in a sociological structure of ideas peculiar to himself. A very similar opinion arises in Toynbee's study of history, also theodicean, but largely brought down to earth by empirical his- torical data. The element of empiricism in Toynbee's work makes him the best advocate of this interpretation of history for a modern social scientist to follow and use. It is easy, and indeed necessary, to disagree with him in detail, and it is possible to expel from his argument its theodicean ele- ment. After that, however, it is not, in my opinion, possible to refute his contention that civilized human societies have each passed through phases roughly equivalent to one another, except in so far as some indi- vidual societies have been to some extent deflected from the general pat- tern of evolution by pressure of other societies external to them. It is possible to look upon this large fact as evidence for mechanism: to say, not at all that the molecules of which a man's physique - or, a word now coming into use, "somatopsyche" -is composed blindly run, but that they run according to a law which governs man himself, and takes no account of his will, overriding it. But this hypothesis is not the only possible hypothesis to explain the events, and not, in my view, the best one. There is every evidence that man's will actually aims at the course of evolution which his civilized societies have followed. In particular, there is abundant evidence that he desires to create that single social- political union of the whole society, the "universal state," which is to a varying extent achieved in the culminating phase of the history of every civilized society. Is it not rather insistently clear today, since the inven- 306</page><page sequence="3">ATOMIC FORCE tion of atomic explosions, that many men ardently desire to see such a world-state set up, and fear only that this is beyond man's powers? It is permissible to argue from this that the cyclic repetitions of his- tory do not witness to the nugatory quality of the human will, but in- stead to the participation of the human will in the causation of events in the human sphere. I submit that this hypothesis takes account of more of the facts than the mechanistic hypothesis, that it accords, as the other does not, with naive common sense, to which every reasonable philoso- pher is agreed that all doctrine is finally answerable. This means meta- physically that, whatever the human mind is, it has some relation to the unknown method, theme, and coherent meaning of total evolution. But what is the meaning of the variant events of human history, those which make the pattern of evolution of civilized societies only roughly, not exactly, equivalent? (It is to be noticed in passing that they are lesser events.) "There are no identities in nature," so far as we know nature. But that is not an explanation: it is merely the formu- lation of an important fact. If we say, as we do in this essay, that every- thing is caused, then there are causes for these variations. It is not per- haps very clear what the causes are, but probably they also are in part choices of the human mind, and for the other part interventions of man's physical environment in special and different ways in the evolution of different societies. Perhaps the latter are primary and the former sec- ondary to some extent, so that we should here recognize the human mind as intervening in the adjustment of species to environment, and so at least minimizing what is described as chance in Neo-Darwinian biology. In whatever way this phenomenon is explained, it must clearly be rec- ognized as the lesser element in the causation of human history. The greater element, in the present hypothesis so far, is the human will creating the major phases of the general pattern--this without preju- dice to the possible metaphysical involvement of the human will with other qualities or things in the causation of total evolution. The release by human agency of atomic forces is, I believe, an oppor- tunity for adding something to the hypothesis here put forward. Every student of history, who has given any attention to the broader meanings of his subject, is aware that the nationalisms of our contemporary so- ciety constitute an extreme phenomenon. Many who do not pay much attention to broad meanings have vaguely and half-consciously equated the separate cultures of our sovereign nations with the cultures of total civilized societies in the past. Conceptions of the latter kind only bear witness to the unusual character of the phenomenon of nationalism as it has developed today. If Toynbee's doctrine, or that of Spengler, be applied for purposes of prediction to our contemporary Western Society, either demands that 307</page><page sequence="4">there shall in the future be a political unification of the society through conquest of all the nations step by step until only a single conquering nation is left; that would be the universal state. Nor is it difficult to discern lineaments of such a future in the recent past, beginning with the ambitious plans of Louis XIV, proceeding through the abortive achievements of Napoleon, and those of the Germans under the Hohen- zollerns and under Hitler--including also, in another way, such epi- sodes as the career of the League of Nations. And yet our obstinate belief that national sovereignty is not wholly without value to our society, our propensity to associate it to the prin- ciple of democracy - to see in it a "democracy of the nations" - casts doubt upon the prediction of a universal state. Are we not so profoundly convinced of the virtues of national sovereignty that we shall refuse to abandon the institution? And, if we are, are we capable of finding a federative substitute for the universal state by conquest, as urged by Clarence Streit, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, and others? Is that sort of aspiration hopelessly impractical and quite beyond our powers? We are urgently facing this question, and most opinion seems to be that it is beyond our powers. In the recently released Biennial Report of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Marshall said, "If man does find the solution for world peace it will be the most revolutionary re- versal of his record we have ever known." Professor William Ogburn, considering, a few days after the explosion at Hiroshima, whether war could be abolished by giving a monopoly of atomic force to a world or- ganization, said: ". . that is a thousand years off." Within the present hypothesis there are suggestions that the mind of man operates as a cause of events within a circumscribed sphere. If the variation of events in the evolutionary patterns of different societies is affected at all by human causation, are there not limits set by the phys- ical environment within which actual events must be contained? And is not our present stultification before the urgent necessity of creating a world-state evidence that there are other causal forces which we fear that we cannot master? Our free-will appears to be real, but limited. Vico put the general pattern of evolution of civilized societies entirely within the englobement of the human mind; perhaps his reliance after that upon the immanence in that mind of God logically excused him from further critical analysis. But the present juncture in human history makes it compulsory to analyze further the causes of the general pat- tern, as distinct from those of the lesser variations of the pattern. Sup- pose that we do succeed in bringing the improbable world-state into existence, is there any sign of how it might be done? Rather evidently, it could be facilitated by development of peaceful and constructive uses of atomic force. For by that, if we ever achieve it, earthly space between 308 PHYLON</page><page sequence="5">ATOMIC FORCE peoples might well be almost completely annihilated, and, at the same time, wealth, being useful control over physical matter (the environ- ment), would become so great that we might well have no further con- siderable material grounds for international strife. And, alternatively to that rosy prospect, do we not face rather early and very surely the universal state, by conquest, horrible and catastrophic, but nevertheless the universal state, the apparent destiny of all civilized societies; at the end of the catastrophe? Both of these alternatives mean this: that an environmental force has been released which will play a causal part in bringing our Western Society to the same final destiny that other civilized societies before it have reached. Does it not, then, appear likely that human causation is structurally related to a larger system of causation, whose outer, non- human force will be exerted where human causation fails? Is it not also possible that this is not the first occasion in the history of civilized hu- man societies that this has occurred; that it may have occurred also often in the past without its meaning becoming evident to human thought? It is possible that events, which are probably about to happen, will give instead the first occasion upon which this outer relationship of the hu- man will is revealed to the human consciousness. We know virtually nothing about such a relationship yet, but it may be that we are shortly going to learn, in the course of atomic study and experimentation, some- thing of great importance about it-something which will give us a measure of insight into nature's causality and reality which we have not had before. If this should prove so, I venture to predict that it will be of advantage to man far outweighing the damage he may sustain if the present representatives of his species must succumb to unification of their society in an atomic war. Finally, certain precautions. The hypothesis here put forward is read- ily capable of being turned to theodicean purposes. To that procedure I stand wholly agnostic, believing that, although it has served well to keep the structure of philosophy strong and well-adjusted in its parts, it is nevertheless a dangerous obstruction of increase of knowledge. Ap- peal has been made here to metaphysics, and, in fact, Whitehead's "pre- hensions" have lain throughout this essay just behind the written word. I believe that metaphysics is not knowledge, but merely a possible route toward knowledge: that it does not in its own constructions give fact, but may serve only to prepare the mind to discern fact where there is empirical evidence. Therefore, nothing which has been said here is a revelation of any fact; it is intended only to direct the philosopher, the psychologist, the biologist, and all social scientists to be on the look-out, each in his special direction, for novelty which may arise in those direc- tions out of the further work of physicists upon atomic force and structure. 309</page></plain_text>
