<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND MODERN JURISTIC MOVEMENTS E. F. ALBERTSWORTH Man's attempt to obtain aid from his environment in the struggle for existence at times takes the form of religious search, at other times it assumes the character of scientific inquiry. The range of religious investigation has narrowed through the progress of science, which today does much of the work of religion in previous times;' so also in the field of law. The legal order today has wrested from religion much of its territory, either in enabling human beings to live more har- moniously with one another or in securing to them a greater surplus of the economic wealth of the group. The advance of both science and law in these directions has been made possible largely because of the liberalization of the religious mind itself as it became more intelligent in defining or delimit- ing these various fields. The religious spirit is, then, most vitally interested in that phase of environment which is denomi- nated legal, and, either by positive and constructive effort or negative and destructive inertia, attempts to influence it. In attempting to show what is the influence, if any, of cur- rent theological thought upon leading developments in the law and its philosophy in the present, it must be borne in mind that from the very nature of the case mathematical certainty cannot be obtained. We live too close to the social mind of the present to obtain proper perspective; we are handicapped in our analyses by living in the midst of it. The utmost which can be safely predicated is that here in a given instance is to be found a dominant mode of religious thought, while I Two excellent works illustrating this development are Fiske, The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge, and Hocking, The Meaning of God in Human Experi- ence. Very suggestive also are Gwatkin, The Knowledge of God and Its Historical Development, and Youtz, The Enlarging Conception of God. 364</page><page sequence="2">RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND JURISTIC MOVEMENTS 365 at the same time in the law a similar juridical development; and, with the knowledge that man's life is inextricably inter- woven with the social forces and thought-forms of his time, we may plausibly infer that the juridical movement is a result of the religious, or that both are manifestations of a funda- mentally identical social mind.' At the same time, one must not minimize the influence of other factors-such as the eco- nomic, the philosophical, and the social-which may have shaped and crystallized legal rules and institutions. THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT A fundamental presupposition of the dominant religious mind is that the present social order not only must but can be Christianized.2 The meaning of this is that the object of the church and religion is not only to save the human soul in a future world but to save the human being in the present, through social betterment. By means of minimum-wage legislation, workmen's compensation, shorter hours of employ- ment, factory inspection, limiting the power of the creditor or injured party in securing satisfaction, prohibition of child labor, limitations on freedom of contract, and other modern ameliorative measures, the religious spirit is attempting to secure a social rather than a legal justice.3 I The outstanding elements of the modern religious mind may be analyzed as being the following: The scientific and historical; the social program; the divine immanence; the element of democracy; the elements of secularity and humanity; the movement toward church union; the missionary program; and the element of rationality. For suggestive discussion of these matters consult H. C. King, The Moral and Religious Challenge of Our Times, Theology and the Social Consciousness, and Reconstruction in Theology; G. A. Coe, The Religion of a Mature Mind; Youtz, The Enlarging Conception of God; and G. B. Smith, Social Idealism and the Changing Theology. 2 The titles of the various books advocating this social gospel are very suggestive.

The early Christians as well as antecedent movements in Hebraism were completely dominated by messianic ideas of the speedy ending of this "present evil age" and the miraculous establishment of the kingdom of God.' The present social order was disregarded, and the con- cern of men was to inquire what God required of those who were soon to become citizens of an other-worldly kingdom, and not what ought to be done to make this world a better place in which to live.2 And throughout the development of the early Catholic Church, before it was made the state religion under Constantine, there is to be found this apocalyptic move- ment combating the growing tendency to disregard it. With the exception of certain minor sects, during the Middle Ages messianism largely disappeared so far as the idea of imminence was concerned, but the viewpoint still was that the chief con- cern of man was to prepare for the next world, not to improve the present one.

Although in the nineteenth century religious pessimism again blazed forth in some quarters through the revival of messianic teachings,2 the dominant tendency of the religious mind became represented by Armin- ianism, Pietism, Quakerism, and Methodism, in the emphasis which each of these placed upon a religious life and upon the worth of the individual man.3 On the legal side it was an age of property and contract, of industrialism and commercial expansion, and it was not until the present time that the reli- gious spirit succeeded in securing partial recognition by the law of the social interest in the individual moral and social life.4 With regard to social reform, then, the religious mind of the present believes fundamentally in the efficacy of effort, that the world can be made a better place in which to live. It recognizes that the inherited religious doctrines, formulated I K.

The individual is not merely to be saved from a world regarded as hopeless, but the world itself is to be regenerated and Christianized by religious forces.' BIBLICAL CRITICISM AND LAW Involved in the conception that the present social order may be regenerated and Christianized by the conscious and purposive efforts of man, is the altered viewpoint with respect to the authority of the Bible or the literary sources of present- day religion. This new conception is strikingly illustrated in the support which the religious mind today gives to efforts of the state to enact laws dealing with health and prevention of disease, and to the problems arising out of the institutions of the family, particularly in marriage and divorce.2 The older theological conception of an authoritative, legal- istic scripture, interpreted by an official ecclesiasticism, has been a bane to progress of thought in many spheres; the his- I Sociological jurisprudence and social theology are in many respects fundament- ally identical with regard to restating the inherited legal and religious doctrines and dogmas, in order that these shall function for the needs of the present. A leader of the social theological group, Shailer Mathews, and the most prominent exponent of sociolog- ical jurisprudence, Roscoe Pound, treat the past in law and theology in a strikingly similar manner, though each has worked independently of the other and in a different field. The former regards theological dogmas as the result of certain creative, social minds the Greek, Semitic, imperialistic, feudal, nationalistic, bourgeois, and social and democratic. See his article, "The Social Aspects of Theology," Biblical World, June, I9I5; also "The Historical Study of Religion," in G. B. Smith, A Guide to the Study of the Christian Religion. Dean Pound likewise regards legal doctrines and institutions to have been formulated by different social groups in the past, which he terms " Primi- tive," "Strict," "Equity," "Maturity," and "Socialization" of law. See "The End of Law as Developed in Legal Rules and Doctrines," Harvard Law Review, XXVII, I95; also "End of Law as Developed in Juristic Thought," ibid., XXVII, 605; XXX, 20I. 2 Some religious organizations and religious leaders, while admitting the Bible is no longer authoritative where the physical or biological -sciences are involved, never- theless refuse to adopt this position in dealing with sociological problems, as of marriage and divorce. But the dominant religious mind certainly does not draw this distinction. A. Houtin, Histoire du modernism Catholique, chap. ii.</page><page sequence="6">RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND JURISTIC MOVEMENTS 369 tory of the freedom of thought is replete with examples of this unfortunate viewpoint.' The older theology descried efforts to control disease through the imposition of laws relating to compulsory vaccination and sanitation, or the requirements of standards to practice the medical profession. Disease was an inherent part of nature itself, the penalty for man's sins; as human history was supernaturally controlled and governed, so disease could not be eradicated except by miraculous inter- vention of deity.2 The world was in the grip of the devil and his hosts and of demons who caused disease and death; behind this thought was the proof of authoritative scripture itself.3 Hence, hostility arose to state activity, which sought to improve these conditions, or there was indifference to a program of reform; and this religious viewpoint, combined with an extreme individualism, which thought that every person had a natural "right" to practice any calling he chose, obstructed the path- way of the state and law in these matters. So also with respect to the juridical movement to enlarge the grounds for divorce, the religious notion was that scripture being law and it having provided, while the parties were alive, only one ground for the dissolution of the marriage status, the state was outside its sphere in arrogating to itself the authority to extend the 1 It was a long and bitter struggle between liberals and orthodox theologians before the Bible was finally restricted entirely to religious matters-its true function.

The orthodox argument was that it was circumventing the divine plan of suffering or pain as a means of reminding fallen man of his sins. Happily, however, some scientist was able to prove scriptural support for anesthesia in the fact that when God created woman, he caused a "deep sleep" to fall upon him (Adam), before removing the rib.

There was absent the conception, given us by the historical school of religion, that the scriptures embodied both divine and human elements and were not meant to govern the social customs and institutions or the pursuits of scientific inquiry in the twentieth or any other century.2 Thanks, however, to the inestimable results of sane biblical criticism, the Bible as the literary source of the religious spirit was restored to what was regarded its original position, namely, as a record of the experiences of religious persons with a vivid God-consciousness, from whom others in the quest for religious solace and comfort might refresh and inspire themselves for life's ills and activities.3 The authority of the Bible became an authority of the spirit instead of the letter, a religious guide and not a law governing all the intellectual pursuits and social practices of men. It was gradually therefore believed-and is the dominant religious viewpoint-that social practices have very little to do with religion itself,4 or that a particular theo- logical doctrine had soteriological efficacy; but that the essen- tial thing, the fundamental presupposition, involved in being religious was the life which it created in man.5 More and more science and natural methods, including legal programs, I The absolute separation of State and Church was a prominent idea from not only the time when the First Amendment tcW the Federal Constitution was enacted, but even down to recent times, although at present this idea seems to be somewhat modified.

Instead of praying out the weeds from his farm or garden, or asking miraculous intervention to allay his bodily ills, the modern religious man first called upon the man of science for aid, or upon the state, which, through laws and science, made possible the remedying of these situations. Crop bulletins issued by the states or federal government; boards of health, requiring vaccination and sanitary observances; calculations of the weather bureau; publication of vital statistics and scientific inquiries into social conditions; the enactment of eugenics laws-these were the aids which the religious individual of the present fostered and sought for in attempting more efficiently to adjust himself to his social and physical environment.' Moreover, instead of assuming, as did the older theology, that the poor and unfortunate were a part of the social order of nature, affording stimuli to the more fortunate and religious "unto good works and thankfulness," the more modern reli- gious man seeks through law to impose upon employers engaged in hazardous enterprises liability without fault and to provide for workmen's compensation, thus making possible a better and more livable existence In all- these developments, though the cause is beneath the surface and is not always consciously expressed, it is believed that this altered viewpoint with reference to the scriptures is an efficient factor.3 I In Petersen v. Widule, I57 Wis. 64I, a statute was upheld requiring from men only a certificate of freedom from venereal disease as a condition to marriage, the court saying: "I cannot imagine how this law can be said to interfere with worship or liberty of conscience. The notion that marriage was a sacrament, not a civil contract creating a status, once vigorously asserted, has long since passed away." 2 "Juristic Theory and Constitutional Law," Harvard Law Review, XXXIII, 86.

An a priori or intellectual formulation of the nature of Christianity, of God, of religion, or of sin, is abandoned; just as sociological jurists refuse to define in all comprehensive or inclusive terms the nature of law.' Likely none of these ultimate conceptions, which, in the words of Mr. Justice Holmes, are but the skin of human thoughts varying from age to age,2 will ever be seems to be that mere affinity itself will not prohibit the formation of a valid marriage contract, in the absence of any other prohibitions. The Levitical Law was early adopted in England by the ecclesiastical courts. The statute of 32 Henry VIII, chap. xxxviii provided that "nothing, God's law excepted, shall impeach any marriage but within the Levitical degrees." The Levitical Law interdicted marriages based upon affinity (Lev. i8:6-7, I4, 15), with the exception that a brother surviving death of an- other brother was compelled, under certain circumstances, to marry his brother's widow (Deut. 25: 5-IO), the object being to perpetuate the name of the decedent's family. For the way in which American law has generally refused to follow the Levitical dis- tinctions with reference to affinity see Peck, Law of Persons and Domestic Relations, pp. i3i-33; incestuous marriage as void or voidable, L R.

Why, therefore, should present-day theological thought, with its rich experience from the mistakes of the past in these fields concern itself in purely intellectual mysteries to the neglect of the concrete religious needs of the individual and of the social group ? The individual and his religious needs must together work out an experiential, individualistic conception of God, based upon companionship with a "power not ourselves making for righteousness." So also the economic needs of the individual and not some abstract notion of liberty of contract or no lia- bility unless faults are made the criteria of present jurisprudence in enacting new social legislation or upholding it after it is passed. The nineteenth century, a century of expanding commerce not yet ended, unduly stressed the rights of property and contract to the neglect of the economic and moral needs of the individual.' On the contrary, the twentieth century, in an era when religious ideas of the eternal worth of man as a poten- tial member of a divine kingdom of God are dominant, is once more seeking to restate and refashion the inherited law in order to satisfy to the individual and group a maximum of wants with the least sacrifice of others; law is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. Whether religious leaders have consciously in mind the various special movements in the law to realize this objective may be doubtful; but the end is cer- tainly articulate and finds definite expression.2 The older theology, with its belief that the Old and New Testaments were equally authoritative in all their utterances, took its conception regarding the sanction of law from the sup- posedly divine content as revealed in the Mosaic moral code. ' Rudolf Jhering, Scherz und Ernst in der Jurisprudenz, 9th ed., p. 408. 2 The movement toward Christian union, coming largely from the mission field, but also from a consciousness that doctrinal differences should not be a wall of separa- tion, is an example of the tendency to abandon metaphysical doctrinal correctness and to emphasize a program of concrete social improvement.

S. Dennis, The Modern Call of Missions, chap. ix. "Union Movements in Mission Fields."</page><page sequence="11">374 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS We observe a similar idea in the time of the Middle Ages as expressed in the thinking of Aquinas, and see its revival in the sixteenth century by Melanchthon. The notion is that all positive law, as it has been enacted by the sovereign, or expounded by the judge, is merely an unfolding or amplifica- tion of certain eternal principles once given by divine revelation. But, today, with the viewpoint that the Old Testament is merely a record of the experiences of only one Semitic race, very similar to that of surrounding nations; and, with the dis- covery that the Mosaic legislation appeared quite late in the history of mankind and can be found in substance before this time in the clay tablets and monuments of antecendent races, as these have been unearthed by the pick and spade of the archaeologists-the belief with reference to the sanction and nature of law has been profoundly altered.' The idea is preva- lent among religious leaders that law, as we have inherited it, is after all only some convenient arrangement which will best meet the needs of the present moment; it has no peculiar sanctity or sacredness; it embodies no eternal and unchangeable principles; it is the creation of society itself based upon experi- ence how a particular rule or standard works out; it is not something given to men. Sociological jurisprudence, while not stressing any particular conception with reference to the sanc- tion or nature of law, is fundamentally in sympathy with the religious viewpoint. For this school of legal philosophers also A wealth of material setting forth the discoveries of archaeologists and their bearing on the Old Testament may be found in the following: Breasted, The Develop- ment of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt; Jastrow, Die Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens; Rogers, The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria; Bade, The Old Testament in the Light of Today; H.

Not only has the modern religious individual passed under the complete domination of the scientific mode of viewing the universe and its problems, but, due to the doctrine of biological evolution, he has taken a view of dogmas and institutions which is formulated in relative and not in absolute or final terms. Whatever may be the truthfulness of this relative viewpoint, the fact nevertheless remains that religious thought, and like- wise legal philosophy, has been colored by its presence in our world of thought. No longer does the liberal religious mind hold that finality or absoluteness in religious doctrines or insti- tutions has been reached; the inherited dogmas are being re-examined, in the light of the religious needs of the present.3 So also there has been a similar development in the field of law and modern juristic thought. Old premises are being called in question and much of the common law of our ancestors is being found inadequate to govern the complex activities and new conditions of today.4 Even conservative England is I Albertsworth, "The Changing Conception of Law," American Bar Association Journal, November, I922; "The Program of Sociological Jurisprudence," ibid., July, I922; Munro Smith, "Four German Jurists," Political Science Quarterly, X, 664; XI, 278; XII 21; Jhering, Law as a Means to an End, pp. 330-32. 2 E.

Worked out in a simpler, more unified and homogeneous age, it is found by many thoughtful legal scholars that some of the inherited legal doctrines and institutions and modes of reason- ing do not function in the present. The doctrine of the separa- tion of governmental functions is no longer thought to be one based upon metaphysical conceptions as to the nature of gov- ernment; it has yielded to the exigencies of governmental and business needs. The old legal doctrine of liability for fault only has crumbled in many directions before the onslaught of social and religious reformers in behalf of the poorer and more unfortunate classes. And so have fared other doctrines or premises of the common law, as assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and the fellow-servant rule. In all these developments and changes in the law it is seen that the old Puritan notion of an abstract man, governed by an objective standard of freedom and moral responsibility and therefore liable for his acts, has passed away in many fields of the law, and in some others is slowly expiring. On the con- trary, the individual as he is found living in human society in the struggle for existence is made the object of both religion and law in working over inherited religious dogmas and legal doc- trines; systemic or metaphysical treatment of both are sacri- ficed to the economic and moral needs of the human being.2 THE IMMANENCE OF GOD AND LAW REFORM The immanence of God is a leading conception of present- day religious thought. It has two meanings: one a philosoph- ical or metaphysical one, synonymous with pantheism; the I Hudson, "Current Law Reform in England," Harvard Law Review, XXXIV, 640; also Law Quarterly Review, XXXVI, I07; American Bar Associatidn Journal, VIII, 485. 2 "If the scheme of legal conceptions does not express what the consciousness of right brings to the surface in practise, then the scheme of legal conceptions must be altered, for it is false or out of date."

It is said by some liberal theologians that our inherited doctrine of God as an absolute sovereign, governing the world and human relations by inscrutable laws and decrees, comes from a time when politically it was an age of divine right of kings who could not be called to account by the people.' As a consequence, due to the transcendence of God in either theism or deism, there was absent the present conception of a God working with man-in fact, needing him -to improve the present world; and, when with this conception of God there was combined the further notions of apocalypti- cism and chiliasm, the belief became more pronounced that it was futile and useless to attempt to improve through human effort and law the existing social order.2 It would be interesting to study what connection, if any, existed between this mode of religious thought and a similar view in legal philosophy as expounded by the historical school of jurists, who placed little faith in the efficacy of human effort to change the existing law. In the present, however, in the words of a liberal theologian, representing the dominant religious mind: Men who believe in democracy insist on worshiping a God whose excellence is to be found not in an aristocratic "sovereignty" but rather in a self-sacrificing identification of himself with his children in their I Gerald Birney Smith, A Guide to the Study of the Christian Religion, p. 5i6; also in same work, Shailer Mathews, "The Historical Study of Religion," pp. 5I if.

No longer do we seek the aid of personal cosmic spirits in practical life . The anthropomorphism of former days is inapplicable to our present situation.' A natural concomitant of this view of the divine immanence has been to annihilate the sharp antithesis between the sacred and the secular, the present and the future, the human and the divine. A greater appreciation of the worth and sanctity of the present natural or social order, as well as man himself, is found in the thinking of the modern religious individual. That this idea is behind the movement in the law to conserve natural and human resources is at least arguable. All life and activity is now miraculous and supernatural in that it represents the outworking of an immanence making for individual and social righteousness. Through not only religion but also through law, by improving the existing social system, conserving natural and human resources, and making this world a better place in which to live, is man able to assist in the process of a divine, immanent teleology.2 Troeltsch, in pointing out the difference in viewpoints between the medieval and modern religious mind, says: A valuation of the present world for the sake of the riches and beauty of the world, an estimation of the goods attained in the progress of civiliza- tion because of an independent ethical value attaching to them, is conse- quently impossible. But precisely such a valuation of these things is the characteristic feature of the modern feeling toward the world and civiliza- tion.3 It would be an interesting study to ascertain what influence this dynamic and evolutionary conception of God may have had upon statesmen, lawyers, and judges, and the younger genera- I G.

That in these professions and callings one may serve God acceptably; that there is no eccle- siastical monopoly of service in the church itself; that God needs the help of wise and thoughtful individuals in the body politic and in reaching an earthly kingdom of God-all these results might plausibly be said to flow from this changed con- ception with regard to the nature of God and the relationship he sustains to the world and man.' THE DOCTRINE OF MAN AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY There is another fundamental presupposition of the current religious mind which appears to be influencing the law in a profound manner; reference is made to the doctrine with respect to the nature of man and of sin. The soteriology of the past, which the present has inherited, presupposed the his- toricity of the fall of Adam and that mankind needed to be saved from the taint of original sin. The traditional doctrine of atonement was stated in terms of an age which thought differently from our own. "Without the shedding of blood I "One who believes in the possibility of this co-operation with the divine purposes is stimulated to an optimistic idealism with surprising possibilities. One is not daunted by seemingly insuperable difficulties.....While one prays that the Kingdom of God may come, one also rejoices in the opportunity to have a share in bringing in the better day."-G. B. Smith, Systematic Theology and Christian Ethics, p. 573. Kohler has pointed out that psychic moods occur in society just as in the individual, in these words: "There are periods in which the inner life of men is entirely devoted to feelings and emotions, and in consequences their power of resolution become para- lyzed, and the life that finds expression in deeds is almost completely suppressed. Religious fanaticism, which leads to an undervaluation of material things and to a congregationism and communism, based on complete severance from all earthly endeavors (is one of these psychic factors opposed to the altruism already men- tioned)."-Lehrbuch der Rechtsphilosophie, pp. 22-24. See also Ross, Social Psychol- ogy, chap. iii. The psychology of religion of the present has assisted in dispelling the traditional notion that mysticism or pietism is religion, and this new conception has undoubtedly led to the altruistic reaction in favor of the welfare of others. Ames, The Psychology of Religious Experience, chap. iv. As a consequence the doctrine of divine immanence in its emphasis upon service for others has been more influential than appears on the surface.</page><page sequence="17">380 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS there is no remission of sin" may have meant something to an age which was accustomed to bloody sacrifice or capital pun- ishment, but today, when neither of these ideas is favorably received by religious leaders, or even by some courts, the older theological doctrine has been profoundly modified.' Whether a liberal view be adopted that man, because of the immanence of God, is essentially good, free from original sin, or whether the viewpoint be that man though apparently sinful is in a pro- cess of development to a higher moral plane, the conception is that his sins are due to ignorance, heredity, physical conditions, or an unfavorable external environment; and that if these can somehow be remedied, even only partially, there will be less of crime and less danger to social security, with the consequent saving of the individual himself.2 The older theological thinking believed sin and crime in the world to be ineradicable, and that as a consequence the crime and not the criminal should be punished, in order not only to revenge the wrong done to the state, but also to deter the com- mission of similar acts by others; the approach was a priori or mechanical, and not a posteriori or scientific. Complete legal responsibility attached to a full moral responsibility, without investigation whether the individual could be saved to society, or whether society itself were to blame for his crime; essentially a being of original sin, the criminal was receiving only what he deserved through the penalties inflicted. Today, on the contrary, we desire to know what are the facts concern- ing heredity; whether moral delinquency is due to what we inherit or to the social environment and education of the individual. How much does an enfeebled body influence the I Shailer Mathews has admirably shown how the various social minds of the past formulated the doctrine of God-and Atonement in terms of social experience.

Further, what is the effect of overcrowding and undernourishment ? Poor eyesight or adenoids may so exclude a child from normal conditions of activity as to induce hopelessness and passionate attempts to find relief through lawlessness or trickery. Employees may be com- pelled by industrial conditions to do dishonest work, knowing that it is dishonest.' The newer religious thinking of the present, in view of the data given us by psychology and sociology as applied in crimi- nology, seeks to individualize the -punishment consistent with the protection of the social group; to reform the criminal; to minimize the possibility of crime by juvenile court correction; by separate confinement of the more hardened criminal to protect the occasional offender;2 through indeterminate sen- tence to administer mercy as well as justice rather than to wreak vengeance;, and through boards of pardon to give the criminal a chance to redeem his life. The penitential system of the church is sought to be employed rather than the inherited legal conception of punishment to prevent crime. Saleilles tells us that in the penitential system of the church, It is not the crime but the criminal alone that is . . regarded. The legitimate purpose of punishment is to make of the criminal an honest man if that be possible; or, if not, to deprive him of the chance of doing further harm.3 The idea that man was essentially and inherently evil, tainted with the original sin of Adam's fall, has been shown to have colored the function of the judge in our Anglo-American law.4 I Smith, A Guide to the Study of the Christian Religion, p. 522.

But now, with the viewpoint that man if not essentially good, yet will do the right thing in his upward struggle, the religious thought of the times would favor greater freedom on the part of the judge or official as he admin- isters justice; the older theological thinking assumed that man, if not controlled by rules of law or society, would do wrong; the newer religious thought assumes man will attempt the right, being controlled in his act either by tendencies of his better nature or the restraining influence of the group mind.' Hence, giving power to courts to make their own rules of procedure and enlarging their powers of discretion in the administration of justice, with but few superimposed legal rules, and in the enactment of declaratory-judgments laws and creation of small-claims courts for the poor and unfortunate to obtain justice, reflect not only the dominant desire for more speedy justice but also the religious viewpoint with regard to the nature of man and the further conception that in the interests of the individual and the advancement of the kingdom of God the substance of controversies and their speedy solution should be the desideratum. CO-OPERATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE Besides the present tendency of the religious mind to co- operate with the state in securing social reforms, in some instances the church attempts to advance further by endeavor- I Many of our received rules of law were crystallized under theological doctrines with reference to the inherent evil of man; such were the rules which forbade one testi- fying in his own cause; excluding hearsay evidence because the party was not under oath and facing the jury. The former has been completely abandoned, and the latter is being waived by contract between parties themselves, or statutes are conferring upon administrative tribunals power to consider hearsay evidence as well as other kinds. Liberal language is used by the courts today regarding the nature of man and his tend- ency to do right, which would have been condemned a hundred years ago.

In the past in American history, due to the existence of a strong religious individualism brought about by the struggles for religious liberty on the part of the colonists, the dominant attitude was that church and state should be-kept separate. Neither was to encroach upon the legitimate spheres of the other; each had a specialized function to fulfil, with which the other could not, nor should, interfere. The less that the religious group had to do with law and the less that law had to do with religion the better for both. Today, on the contrary, the idea is growing that both law and the state are social agencies to be used by the religious spirit in seeking to achieve its goal of a more perfect, ideal society here and now. In securing the enactment of prohibi- tion legislation the religious forces quite naturally joined with others, but the impetus to this social experiment came largely from religious leaders and religious idealism. Again, the funda- mental belief that war or the settlement of international differences by force can be considerably minimized if not totally prohibited through some league of nations or by some international tribunal or court has also its origin in the religious mind; finding justification for this belief either in some pro- phetic teachings of the Bible, perhaps given increased impetus by a religious reaction after a period of war, or in the concep- tion that human effort, motivated by religious idealism, can make this a better world in which to live.' Moreover, it is observed that at times there are seemingly sporadic attempts made to secure legislation against Sunday labor in particular, and not merely for one day's rest in seven; but these attempts are by no means scattered or only occasional, for congressional records and other data show us that for several decades an organized movement has been in progress, and is still going on, I It need hardly be said that the various schemes in European history for world- organization and international peace tribunals, as exemplified in the suggestions of Henry IV and Czar Alexander I, originated from religious idealism.</page><page sequence="21">384 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS to accomplish this particular objective.' This belief that state and law must advance religious programs of reform is at times seen also in the efforts made by the less dominant reli- gious mind to secure legislation against the teaching of certain scientific theories, as evolution and geology, in state universi- ties, it being thought that in this manner religion will more certainly maintain its traditional or inherited dogmas.2 While it is doubtful whether the dominant religious mind believes in the wisdom of this particular policy, nevertheless the effort itself to secure a closer co-operation between religious organizations and the state, reflects the attitude of the religious leaders generally. Certainly, it must be admitted that the religious mind of the present is having its influence upon the law in many directions, and perhaps the full import cannot now be felt or understood. In the words of Kohler the present religious mind is one "when people devote themselves to the welfare of others . . . . and seek not only to raise up the man who is less favorably situated, but actually to indulge him."3 It is not an age given over to a religious emotional life, but it is a rationally critical age, dis- satisfied with the past and present in both religion and law, an age in transition in both fields, an age which believes its future is yet before it and therefore yet to be realized.
