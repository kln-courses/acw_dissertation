Its object was "to illustrate, as fully as possible, the progress made in the development of Arts and Manufactures during the Victorian Era," l and the exhibition, housed in specially designed cast iron buildings (Fig. 2), included displays of industrial design, decorative arts, machinery, food, household goods, handicrafts, textiles, and horticul- ture. The space in these sections was for the most part let to trade exhibitors to display their wares, but the Fine Arts section was organized on a different basis. With 2,104 items, "limited to Works of Art produced in the United Kingdom during the reign of Her Majesty the Queen" (p. 24), the Exhibition was an attempt to sum up fifty years of British art in a representative display, organized and selected by a committee of Man- chester businessmen, collectors, and art experts, chaired by William Agnew of the firm of art dealers then based in Manchester. Oils, watercolors, drawings, engravings, and architectural designs were included; sculpture was represented but not fully because of the difficulties with transport. An effort was made to encompass all schools and styles, and along with the Academicians were hung the Pre-Raphaelites, including such staunch anti- establishment figures as Ford Madox Brown and Holman Hunt, the aesthetic Grosvenor Gallery artists, and even members of the highly provincial Manchester Academy of Fine Arts who forced their inclusion on a reluctant committee. Whistler, too, was in the original selection, but imposed hanging conditions which the committee were unable to meet.2 The Fine Arts Section generated extensive literature in addition to the Official Catalogue, which sold 100,000 copies.

Some of these were reissued in book form. Souvenir guides and picture books were produced to suit all tastes and pockets including a children's book, The Adventures of Little Man-Chester or Recollections of the Royal Jubilee Exhibition, a more basic A Penny Guide to the Pictures, and more sophisticated critiques.3 All the writers agreed on one thing: the Royal Jubilee Exhibition was the most wonderful and comprehensive collection of Victorian art ever assembled and it provided a unique opportunity to assess the progress of British art over the past half century. In light of recent research and the increasing number of exhibitions devoted to Victorian painting, it is instructive to re-examine the Manchester 1887 exhibition and the place of popular painting within it, and to resurrect some forgotten, famous pictures in order to reconstruct a moment in Victorian taste, both critical and public. One of the great differences between the 1887 exhibition and previous large art exhibitions held in Britain was that at Manchester vast numbers of the general public attended who would not normally have done so. The Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857 was solely an art exhibition. In 1887, the public were drawn in by the range of attractions: the boilers and steam engines, the demonstrations of industrial processes from aerated waters to hat making, the soap manufacturers' stands with busts of Victoria and Albert in soap, the life-size reconstruction of Old Manchester, the Fairy Fountain lit up at night with colored lights, the gardens, the sports events, and the concerts by Edward de Jong's Jubilee Band. The record attendance for a single day was 74,595 on October 15, when special events included a fruit show and bicycle races. This figure exceeded even Jubilee Day, June 21, when 70,141 attended, and August Bank Holiday when the total was 69,555. The attendance for the entire 165 days of the exhibition was 4,765,137 (Report, diagram facing p. 255). Figures for the Art Galleries were not separately recorded, but most of the visitors must have had a look at what was one of the main attractions of the whole exhibition, as there was no separate admission charge. The Committee of the Fine Arts Section considered it "no unfair inference that the whole number of the 3The children's book was by E. Ellen Houghton. The guides, in addition to the official Guide and the official Catalogue to the Fine Art Section, include A Penny Guide to the Pictures, Darby shire 's Guide, Percy 's Guide, and Connolly 's Guide.

Whether or not this inference was accurate, the attendance exceeded the 400,000 or so art lovers who went to the Academy each summer, and the 1,336,715 who visited the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857.4 The public were attracted by means of advertising under the slogan "Gem of the Jubilee." Admission was one shilling, except Fridays when it was a half crown. There were season tickets, and railway excursion tickets inclusive of admission and travel to the special exhibition station. There were special admission arrangements on certain days for children from elementary, industrial, and ragged schools, for even the single shilling admission fee put the exhibition out of reach of the poorer sections of the working class.5 Press complaints that not enough had been done for the poor pointed out that at recent exhibitions in Paris and Vienna free admission for the poor had been arranged. The Galleries were usually thronged with visitors: "Yesterday was a quiet day, well suited to those of a contemplative mood, and such no doubt take advantage of half-crown days. . . . Always excepting the famous art gallery, all the other parts of the interior were very easy of access."6 Many of the crowd were unfamiliar with art, despite their keenness to learn. A letter to the Manchester Guardian requested lectures for visitors "who are fairly cultivated in intellect, without any professional artistic training" and suggested the layman would be helped by "fixing a printed label to each picture pointing out its special merits and giving such explanation of its history as would assist to its full comprehension and enjoyment" (October 5). Further evidence of the unfamiliarity of the public with art is provided in the contemporary press. "Sir," another reader wrote to the editor of the Manchester Guardian: Most of us could supplement your correspondent's amusing article by relating curious remarks overheard among the pictures. One, made by a poor care-worn looking woman, standing in front of Orchardson's Alone was to me somewhat touching. Putting a finger almost close to the decanter on the dinner table, she said, "It's this ere's done it all." Poor thing! If she failed to discern the moral of this story, she probably put her finger on the root of all evil in her own experience.

A working-class woman with an elderly companion entered saying, "The best pictures are in these end rooms if you can hold out a bit longer. See! there's Daniel in the Lion's Den" pointing to Landseer's Van Amburgh. Afterwards I noticed a well-dressed party, consisting of two young men and a young woman. "Oh! I do believe these are some of Turner's," said one of the men. "Yes, they are," as he looked in the catalogue. "Now, you must just come about ten yards off," he continued, placing his companions in the right position, "and look at it for a minute or two, and you will see how it will grow upon you, just like a mist passing away." The experiment was tried, the result was derision. "I don't see anything in it," said the young woman. "The frame's worth more than the picture," said the other man. "That just shows you know nothing of the value of pictures," was the reply. "Why, you couldn't buy any of them for less than five thousand a piece." Some clue as to the tastes of the general public can be gleaned from a public poll to choose the best pictures in the Exhibition (City News, August 27). 7 A competition was held by one of the exhibiting firms, who offered a prize to whoever came closest to the top twelve. The result of the vote, in which over 12,000 people took part, was as follows: 1. The Village Wedding by Luke Fildes (No. 222) 2. Diana or Christ? by Edwin Long (No. 545) 3. The Babylonian Marriage Market by Edwin Long (No. 540) 4. Balaclava by Lady Elizabeth Butler (No. 10) 5. Hard Times 1885 by Hubert von Herkomer (No. 74) 6. Atalanta's Race by Edward Poynter (No. 492) 7. Home they brought her warrior dead by P. H. Calderon (No. 275) 8. The Return of the Penitent by Luke Fildes (No. 242) 9. The Daphnephoria by Sir Frederic Leighton (No. 512) 10. Scene in Braemar, Highland Deer &amp;c. by Sir Edwin Landseer (No. 542) 11. Manage de Convenance by W. Q. Orchardson (No. 380) 12. Hypatia by C. W. Mitchell (No. 67) In a second poll to discover the most popular artist, Luke Fildes again achieved first place.8 Clearly, such a list should not be interpreted too rigidly. The precise order is arbitrary. People were likely to vote for what they thought should win, rather than for what they liked. Large, prominently hung pictures were bound to do better than small, more subtle works. Yet the list suggests the popular appeal of certain classes of pictures, and in its general character it is supported by other accounts. "Works like the 'Village Wedding,' 'The Mariage de Convenance,' 'Hard Hit,' and 'Balaclava' are those round which the appreciative groups will be found thickest," declared a writer to the Manchester Guardian (October 5), and the Manchester City News commented that the '"Village Wedding' attracts more attention from the average excursionist - say from Oldham or Bolton - than any other picture in the show" (June 25). Fildes' The Village Wedding (Fig. 3) hung on the line, though not in an especially good position. It was a relatively new work, having been shown at 7See also L. V. Fildes, Luke Fildes R.A., A Victorian Painter (London, 1968), p. 109. 8Catalogue entry numbers are provided in parentheses for the winning pictures in the listing and for other exhibited works mentioned in the text.

The Village Wedding is a picture packed with incident, an attraction evident to a reviewer when the picture was new: While the central figures of the rural bride and bridegroom deservedly fix the attention, the canvas is delightfully crowded with children, with women, with old men and with the wedding personnel of mother, sisters and soldier brother, each person doing exactly what is natural and all together making up a picture of infinite variety and interest. (Fildes, p. 83) Fildes added to the eternal appeal of a bride and of country life an element of nostalgia, employing a style of dress, now become picturesque, that he remembered from his childhood. Historical costume, he felt, was too artificial and modern dress too ugly: I am going in for just what I think likely to happen and paint an episode in a quiet little village somewhere in my own head, the quiet little village life with the coarseness and ugliness of immediately modern times pressed out of it, and yet not put far back enough for people to say I am not painting my own time. (p. 73) The result has a kind of blandness which sets the picture apart from the dramatic and depressing scenes of poverty and distress with which he had made his name. "The picture won't have a scrap of what is considered my 'forte,' viz. Sentiment," he wrote (p. 73), but to modern eyes its novelettish sweetness is itself sentimental. But the "good old style of a country wedding" as one newspaper put it {Critical Notices , p. 24), appealed even to serious critics such as Patrick Geddes, later to become famous as a social reformer and pioneer of town planning, who felt that pictures like this "give English art a real hold upon its own villages" (Geddes, p. 12). In contrast, the Manchester City News was condescending: "Decidedly common, not to say vulgar, but it tells its simple story kindly and effectively" (June 25). The picture attracted attention for its daringly bright color as much as for its story. The Art Journal drew attention to its "brilliant sunshiny effect"; the Manchester Courier called it "a bold piece of colouring ... the scarlet jacket of the tall soldier was a risky experiment"; and Hodgson praised the "truth and brilliancy" of the "out-of-door daylight" effect.9 Walter Armstrong, writing in the Manchester Guardian, was somewhat more guarded in praising the picture: We call it audacious not, of course, for its subject, nor even for the larger details of its treatment, but for the intention carried out by its author to drag the exact tints and shapes worn by village people twenty years ago on to his canvas. Mauve and magenta are not exactly aesthetic colours, but Mr. Fildes has marshalled them with skill, and time will complete the harmony, (p. 22) The second and third paintings on the list were both by Edwin Long. In Diana or Christ? (Fig. 4) the religious faith of a Roman lady is being tested. 9W. J. Arnold, The Manchester Exhibition, in Art Journal (1887), p. 21; Critical Notices, p. 23; Hodgson, p. 94.</page><page sequence="9">200 / VICTORIAN POETRY</page><page sequence="10">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 201 She raises her eyes to heaven while being urged to make a sacrifice at the altar of the goddess. The catalogue gave the quotation "Let her cast the incense, but one grain, and she is free," and added "The scene is laid in Ephesus, at the end of the stadium, which might have been used as an amphitheatre." The "might have been" is typical of the regard paid to accuracy in Victorian historical and classical painting. As in Fildes' Village Wedding the canvas is crowded with figures, though they are rather wooden in comparison, and those at the front are not clearly related spatially to the crowds in the background. The dilemma is made clear by theatrical means: facial expressions are exaggerated and labored, all eyes are upon the lady, and her pale figure stands out among dark ones. "Not only a fine work technically, but also full of thrilling dramatic interest," wrote Hodgson (p. 82), but the City News, unmoved, thought it "vulgar and empty" (June 18). The third of the twelve, The Babylonian Marriage Market (Fig. 5) was Long's most famous painting, and it had in 1882 achieved notoriety when it fetched the highest price yet paid for a modern picture.10 It and Diana or Christ? were hung equally prominently in the Central Hall of the exhibition (Fig. 12). Writing of this painting, most critics made only perfunctory remarks on technical or aesthetic matters: "The arrangement and composi- tion of the subject are well managed" was the Courier's generalization (Critical Notices, p. 41). What most fascinated them was the story, and there were long explanations, based on the quotation from Herodotus given in the catalogue, describing how the ancient Babylonians chose their wives by auctioning them in order of their beauty. Hodgson and the writer in the Courier both relished the way Long had varied the characterization of each of the slave girls waiting to be sold, and enjoyed speculating on their different fates. Walter Armstrong expressed critical disapproval of both pictures: Neither is, strictly speaking, a work of art at all, though both contain more pretty heads and much careful archaeology. . . . Some may think us over-severe in denying the character of fine art to these two pictures. But in what do they excel? If they excel at all, it is in two things - in the beauty of the heads they contain and in the interest of the story they tell. No one will contend that a pretty head makes a work of art, or a story that is mainly outside the canvas. The conditions for a good picture are good design, good colour and good chiaroscuro, or at least one of the three, and all are absent from these later productions of Mr. Long. (p. 33) But the public went for a pretty head and a story existing mainly outside the canvas. Balaclava (Fig. 6) by Lady Butler came fourth, and all were agreed on the dramatic power of this reconstruction of the horrific aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade, the wounded staggering up the hill, and the dazed young Hussar covered in blood, walking straight out of the picture 10Bought for £6615 by Thomas Holloway in 1882.</page><page sequence="11">202 / VICTORIAN POETRY</page><page sequence="12">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 203</page><page sequence="13">204 / VICTORIAN POETRY •I</page><page sequence="14">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 205 towards the spectator. This event was relatively recent history, and the artist had used the recollections and, in some cases, the actual uniforms of survivors so effectively that when the painting was first shown in 1876, a lady was led out of the room in tears, and an officer who had been through the charge said that he would never have come to see the picture if he had known how like the real thing it was. Armstrong was moved by the drama, but he felt that it "would have been enormously helped by a careful regard to truth in such accessories as the structure of ground and the effect of atmo- sphere."11 The setting and the way the figures are composed in piled-up groups are indeed unrealistic and stagy, but the dramatic treatment doubtless intensified the sense of horror in the admiring crowds. The fifth painting, Herkomer's Hard Times 1885 (Fig. 7) differs from the preceding pictures in that it is not a crowded scene. The poor farm laborer, his wife, and children are cast out, homeless and jobless. The landscape is deliberately left empty to suggest their loneliness and desola- tion, an impression reinforced by the birds in the empty sky, and the tiny figures on the path in the distance. It was a topical painting when new, for, according to the artist, it "articulated a distress amongst the labouring classes poignantly felt by them that year," when there had been heavy unemployment and a hard winter. 12 Rural distress had the opposite appeal to the rural charm of The Village Wedding, but it was still popular: " A very fine picture, excellent in drawing and admirable in tone and colour, but almost too sad to make one willing to live with it" (City News, June 25). In choosing a serious and tragic social problem, Herkomer subtly distorted and distanced his theme. By depicting rural rather than urban poverty, he avoided the problems closest to the Manchester public, the squalor of the slum and the mill, and made something unpleasant more acceptable. His laborer is heroic rather than sordid. Number six, Poynter's Atalanta's Race (Fig. 8), illustrates the Greek myth of Atlanta, retold by Morris in his Earthly Paradise. Atalanta vowed she would only marry the man who could run faster than she could. No one succeeded until Milanion tricked her by dropping three golden apples in her path whilst he was racing her; she slowed down to pick them up and lost the race. The painting was one of four large canvasses commissioned by the Earl of Wharncliffe for his billiard room at Wortley Hall. All four were shown at Manchester, and they made a spectacular group. The City News felt it unfair to judge them with the other pictures as they were intended for a specific room, but could not resist commenting that "the figure of Milanion is undoubtedly wooden and singularly lacking in 'go.' He may be Mr. HE.

Atalanta on the other hand is drawn with wonderful vigour" (June 18). Armstrong also had fun at Poynter's expense: "It is obvious that if Atalanta elected to run in the impossible garment in which Mr. Poynter had draped her, . . . Milanion . . . would have no need of bribery to win his race. The real Atalanta ran, no doubt, in nothing at all" (p. 33). Other writers were more responsive to the beauties of the work. In one respect it was unique, and it was perhaps this characteristic that made it such a success at the exhibition. It was the only picture showing active movement. Not only the running figures but also the crowds, the receding architecture, and the empty spaces reinforced what Geddes described as its "rare originality in vivid action" (p. 11). Calderon's Home they brought her warrior dead (Fig. 9) is a costume drama illustrating Tennyson's song in The Princess: Home they brought her warrior dead: She nor swooned nor uttered cry: All her maidens, watching, said, "She must weep or she will die." Rose a nurse of ninety years, Set his child upon her knee - Like summer tempest came her tears - "Sweet, my child, I live for thee." The City News felt that the picture could not stand comparison with the poem which inspired it (July 2), but Hodgson found its dramatic sentiment impressive: "As you look at it you feel the hushed awe which pervades a chamber of death." Its color he found "rich and magnificent in quality" {Critical Notices, p. 26). Another dramatic work of a similar kind was eighth in the list. The Return of the Penitent by Luke Fildes (Fig. 10). Painted in his earlier, more sombre manner, the picture shows a fallen woman returning to her cottage under the censorious eyes of fellow villagers. These figures are heavily foreshortened, silhouetted against the sky and turning to look, leading the eye to the kneeling figure. "Mr. Fildes' picture ... is overdone by the enormous horse which stalks out of the canvas like a sort of fate and dwarfs the story," wrote Armstrong (p. 23), but this device added to its power. "I have heard it called stagy," wrote The Times critic when the picture was first shown. "I fear that any painter who aims at telling a story dramatically must be prepared for this charge" (Fildes, p. 82). Others found it moving and compassionate, "full of unforced pathos" (MCN, June 25) - "one of those pictures . . . which illustrate the highest functions of art" (Critical Notices, p. 26). Such pictures have lost the power to move viewers today. The ninth picture, Leighton's The Daphnephoria (Fig. 11), returns to the classical revival. Prominently hung in the Central Hall, this work was inspired by the</page><page sequence="17">208 / VICTORIAN POETRY</page><page sequence="18">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 209 2! i</page><page sequence="19">210 / VICTORIAN POETRY</page><page sequence="20">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 211 procession held at Thebes every nine years in honor of Apollo. The title is taken from the sacred laurel branches held by the celebrants, who are led by the youthful "Daphnephoros," or laurel-bearer. Like Poynter's picture, Leighton's was not intended as a piece of classical history. Poynter showed the Greek worship of the athletic body; Leighton painted a glorious hymn to the Grecian ideal of beauty expressed in poetry and music. Set in a grove of trees in the evening sunlight, the figures gracefully move forward, their rhythmical groupings suggesting the measured harmony of their song to Apollo. The critics, recognizing the graceful and decorative qualities of the pictures, piled on superlatives: "nothing finer for grace and beauty ... in the purest taste and executed with refinement" (Critical Notices, p. 38); "a very beautiful and masterly work" {City News, June 18); "one of the finest pieces of decoration produced by our English school" (Armstrong, p. 31); Hodgson even visualized it in the mid-twentieth century in another great exhibition when "it will be an old master" (p. 63). Armstrong still found the classical convention hard to reconcile with his demand for realism: "Artificial of course it is. The flesh is not real flesh, nor the landscape a real landscape . . . his drawing of the human form is always mannered and often incorrect." "We must be content to regard the work as architectonic, as treating the subject in the same spirit as Phidias treated the Pan-Athenaic procession. And then it will give real pleasure" (p. 31). Yet for the public, its appeal had more to do with its spectacular magnificence and its huge size, for it was one of the largest pictures in the exhibition. If this was the largest, Landseer's Scene in Braemar, tenth in the list, was the tallest, and the scale of the animals was larger than Leighton's figures. It hung prominently in the Central Hall, facing the Leighton and between the two Longs; the stag, silhouetted against the sky, towered over the spectators (Fig. 12). Its position probably contributed to its popularity, for Landseer was the only artist on the list who was no longer alive, and his work was looking distinctly old-fashioned in 1887. He was regarded as having too much facility, and in this work the "too feathery handling of the skins of the animals" was criticized (Armstrong, p. 38). Eleventh came Orchardson's modern domestic tragedy, the Manage de Covenance (Fig. 13), showing a rich, balding husband facing a bored young wife across a dinner table in a shadowy, opulent interior. The sequal to this picture, After (exhibited under the title Alone), depicted the same man seated deserted and alone, gazing into the fire at a table laid for one. It was the first time the pair had been exhibited together, as they were painted three years apart and belonged to different owners. "Painful pictures, things to shudder at rather than admire, but no-one can deny their power," wrote the City News (June 25). For once the drama is not made too theatrical for</page><page sequence="21">212 / VICTORIAN POETRY</page><page sequence="22">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 213 •I</page><page sequence="23">214 / VICTORIAN POETRY Figure 14</page><page sequence="24">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 215 modern taste, perhaps because of the refinement of Orchardson's extraor- dinary technique, which appeared startling in the company of the heavily worked oils that dominated the exhibition. The Orchardsons were "remark- able for their daintiness of execution, and for a peculiar flaxen and delicate key of colour . . . appreciation of semitones, of delicate gradations of light" (Hodgson, pp. 73-74); "The work is left open, and the brushmarks are allowed to show" (Critical Notices, p. 32). The last of the finalists was Hypatia by C. W. Mitchell (Fig. 14). Hypatia, the eponymous heroine of Kingsley's novel, like the lady in Diana or Christ?, was a Christian convert during the late Roman Empire. Mitchell showed her trying to ward off the pagan mob, who pursued her to the Basilica, intent on crushing her to death. For one in this distraught and battered plight, she looked unconvincingly radiant, and this anomaly provoked some criticism. Portrayed in the nude, her clothing having been torn from her, Hypatia was not the only naked lady in the exhibition: Calderson's Aphrodite (No. 919), though eventually hung, caused the Committee initially to decide to send it back to its owner as not "in keeping with the general character of the works in the exhibition."13 About Hypatia, the critics were of mixed opinions: Armstrong felt that in the picture "a complete femininity is united . . . with a total absence of any of those more voluptuous characteristics . . . inconsistent with our notion of Kingsley's heroine" (p. 16); the City News, on the other hand, found her ridiculous, looking like a model who was "too tired of standing in one somewhat cramped position in a cold and draughty studio" (June 18). What does the public poll and the critical response to these dozen pictures reveal about popular taste? One thing is clear: the poll was a resounding victory for narrative painting. The pictures which caught the public eye were large and mainly modern; with the single exception of Landseer's, each told a simple story. Many of them were crowded with detail. The results, at the time, were predictable, as a letter in xht Manchester Guardian evaluating the taste of the public makes clear: "It is easy to understand that the pictures which prove the most attractive to the bulk of the visitors are those which, along with technical skill, have a meaning that is easily read. It is a picture which has a story to tell, and tells it at a glance, that most attracts the popular taste" (October 5). The accuracy of this view is confirmed by the general character of some of the other paintings selected as the hundred most popular in the exhibition, though a complete list of these does not survive (Guardian, August 27). Among them were Frith's The Derby Day (No. 84), Orchardson's Napoleon aboard the Bellerophon (No. ^Minute Books, April 20, 1887.</page><page sequence="25">216 / VICTORIAN POETRY 388), Yeames' Prisoners of War (No. 146) and Amy Robsart (No. 901), Millais' The North West Passage (No. 476) and The Vale of Rest (No. 478), Maclise 's Af erry Christmas in the Baron's Hall (No. 812), Leighton's/Ztfra/fes Wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestis (No. 436) and Alma-Tadema's Festival of the Vintage (No. 316). There were other sides to Victorian painting besides narrative pictures, and all were represented in the exhibition: animals, portraits, landscapes and what may loosely be described as poetic paintings. In the animal category, Landseer's stags, as already noted, did well, and the lions in his Van Amburgh (No. 639) ensured it a place in the top hundred. But his "not very pleasant anthropomorphic fancy" was out of favor with the public, despite the expectations of certain writers who felt the public liked animals in human guise. The City News was surprised that Henry Stacy Marks's heavy-humored bird paintings "which one would think would appeal strongly to popular taste, do not appear on the list" (August 27). Offering H. H. Couldery's An Oyster Supper (Fig. 15) to the selectors, the Director of Nottingham Art Gallery wrote, "It is a picture that is very attractive to the working classes, whilst it is a very beautiful painting."14 The painting was hung, but the public had better taste than to vote for it or anything like it. As for portraits, Millais' Cardinal Newman (No. 479) was in the first hundred but this was probably "as much on account of its gorgeousness as on account of its merits," and the portraits of the Queen and the Prince of Wales did well "but of course, that was a necessity" {City News, August 27). The organizing Committee had decided at the outset to include portraits of famous Victorians, but members vacillated as to whether they should be considered works of art or isolated from the other pictures in a gallery of historical portraits. In the end, they were mixed with the rest, occasioning some criticism; but Armstrong, for instance, on the basis of the achievement of Millais, Holl, Herkomer and Ouless, claimed "the right to put the portrait painting of today at a higher level than the art has touched since Reynolds, Gainsborough and Romney" (p. 59). The public, not surprisingly, dis- agreed. They did vote for a few landscape paintings in the top 100, among them A Spate in the Highlands by Peter Graham (No. 169), Ripening Sunbeams by Vicat Cole (No. 339) and The Grey of the Morning by John Brett (No. 181). Such works were mentioned by the critics with approval, but all writers agreed that the early Victorian period, when Turner, Cox and de Wint were still working, was superior to the present for landscapes. None of the classic English landscape painters, however, seemed to hold much appeal for the public although numerically they dominated the exhibition: with forty-six ^Minute Books, March 14, 1887.</page><page sequence="26">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 217 .5.</page><page sequence="27">218 / VICTORIAN POETRY paintings, Cox had the greatest number of works by a single artist; William Henry Hunt came next with thirty-seven, followed by Watts with thirty- five, Millais with thirty, and Turner with twenty-eight; Copley Fielding, Holland, Landseer, and Rossetti were represented by twenty or more. Many of these works were watercolors, small and beyond the stamina of the average visitor, for the watercolors were hung at the far end of the galleries, away from the entrances. Even the critics only gave them perfunctory attention, for oil was regarded as the superior medium. Watercolors, wrote Armstrong, "by the qualities of their material are condemned to stand aside from the great main route of art history . . . vigour, variety and richness are more telling and more lasting qualities than delicacy" (p. 59). Poetic painters, such as Burne-Jones and Rossetti, though criticized for their lack of academic virtues, such as drawing and naturalism, were on the whole praised by the critics, especially for the power of their visions. But they were too difficult for the general public to accept: "Why, then do these artists persist in hiding and disguising their thought, producing not pictures but enigmas, which, to the uninitiated like myself, are generally ridiculous?" wrote a correspondent to the Manchester Guardian, who went on to query "why all these transcendental females should be an inch and a half longer in the neck than ladies one meets with in everyday life" (October 5). On the other hand, it is gratifying to note that Rossetti's Dante's Dream (No. 702) found a place in the top hundred. Still, Geddes felt the gap between public and cultivated taste was a wide one: It is strangely painful indeed to stand before some great picture . . . and yet to be made to feel how little one person sees, and how inaccurately another The peculiar manner and meaning of Rossetti or of Burne-Jones must needs to many people seem simply affected, the solemn parables of Watts unintelligible, or the characteristic pathos of Walker or of Mason pass unnoticed altogether, (p. 1) This gap is echoed in a letter from the young Roger Fry to his mother, describing a visit to the exhibition: "As you despise Burne-Jones and Rossetti and I have a somewhat similar feeling for Edwin Long, I fear it will not be much use my 'enthusing' about the pictures I liked best."15 What the young aesthete did like best were the Walkers, the Madox Browns, and watercolors by Prout, Roberts, and A. W. Hunt. But he also praised Leighton's Daphnephoria, a work which seemed to have equal appeal to the public and the highbrows in its combination of narrative spectacle with aestheticism. Of the "difficult" painters in the exhibition, G. F. Watts is interesting because his work was more prominently hung than that by any other artist. An entire wall of 23 pictures was devoted to him (Fig. 16). He was a l5Letters of Roger Fry, ed. Denys Sutton (London, 1972), I, 117.

The hanging together of works by a single artist to form a group was a feature of the exhibition which received much praise: the tone of the artist's work was thus not lost, and his development could be studied in context. Among the artists so honored were Turner, who had sixteen watercolors in one room and twelve oils in another; Landseer with fifteen oils. Cox with fourteen, Millais with thirteen, twelve each for Burne-Jones, Alma-Tadema and Phillip, and ten each for Rossetti and Stanfield. The visitor could not have missed these artists, yet the response to each was markedly different. No writer on the exhibition ever challenged the whole idea of narrative painting in the same way that Whistler attacked the "great British subject" and its lack of sensitivity to pictorial values. As already indicated, the writers accepted the story-paintings, and if they had any criticisms they were concerned with how the story or the details were handled, not with narrative painting itself. Yet in some of their remarks can be sensed a dislike of the triteness of many of the subjects. Armstrong, in his comments on Edwin Long, stated his preference for pictorial qualities over the interest of the subject, and the City News agreed that there were higher values than surface realism or narrative. Writing of Alma-Tadema, this critic said, "You admire them, certainly, for the masterly technical knowledge they are full of, but you do not love them and return to them again and again as you do to Mason or Rossetti"; and of Burne-Jones he observed, "There have been faults within the correction of any tyro, and that in all of these there have been beauties beyond the attainment of any master but himself (June 8). The fullest statement of the position of narrative painting in a system of values can be found in the pamphlet by Patrick Geddes. He felt that the variety of subject matter introduced by Victorian artists had important educational value, as it made the public aware of different aspects of life. He gave particular praise to the historical painters, especially Alma-Tadema, for their "systematic and thorough resuscitation of the past." However, pictorial qualities were more important than mere representation: an artist should be judged "neither by the accuracy of his botany nor the extent of his knowledge of costume, but by the beauty of his colour, the quality of his light and shadow, the rhythm of his line." He even recommended judging a picture by examining it upside down. But he concluded that the highest qualities in art were not necessarily related to skill or sight, but were spiritual qualities, the power to express "the still sad music of humanity" (pp. 13, 15, 25). Like other critics, Geddes cites the names of Mason, Walker, Rossetti, and Burne-Jones, the real heroes for the more discerning writers. There is one sense in which the public, the critics, and the Committee of organizers were in agreement: they all believed in progress, in the superiority of 1887 over 1837. "These thirteen rooms," Armstrong remarked, "contain a selection better than the whole United Kingdom could have afforded fifty years ago"; "It will be seen how vastly art has developed</page><page sequence="30">JULIAN TREUHERZ / 221 during the last fifty years, not merely in actual craftsmanship, but in nobility of aim and depth" (p. 62). The very arrangement of the exhibition placed the emphasis on the moderns, separating the living artists from the deceased and locating works by living artists in the rooms by the main entrances. "It feels strange," Armstrong noted, "to find the first rooms filled with the works of living men; to then gradually work back to the ancienne ecole" (p. 4). Perhaps not unexpectedly, the selection of works by living artists was better than that for the deceased: living artists were asked by which works they wished to be represented, and no one quarrelled seriously with the result. But the dead could not be asked, and the selectors were fiercely attacked for poorly representing some early Victorian artists, and for omitting others altogether, among them William Hilton, George Jones, Abraham Cooper, William Westall, William Beechey, B. R. Haydon, Francis Danby, John Martin, and David Scott. This unappreciative attitude to the recent past was also reflected in the critical reaction to the early Victorians, particularly the narrative painters Elmore, Ward, Cope, and Egg - "so-called historical painters." Many echoed the view expressed of Frith's historical scenes as "so many stage supers conventionally posed and dressed out of the stock theatrical wardrobe" {City News, May 28). Today one might use the same words to describe some of the top twelve pictures of 1887, such are the vagaries of fashion. The belief in the superiority of the present over the past led to some striking comparisons. Hodgson drew a parallel between the progress of art and the Victorian conquest of nature, "tunneling mountains, and bridging valleys, filling the whole wide world with its organised activity" (p. 9). And Geddes compared art and science in another way, particularly relevant to the idea of art and the people: Science, too, can nowadays be successfully popularised, so that the very simplest mind can follow the physical as he watches the marvellous dance of atoms or the naturalist as he probes the secrets of life; and why should not Art too, become again what it once was - the every-day possession of the people? Why should we not borrow the secret of science? Armed with its powers of analysis and comparison, every man might indeed become his own Art Critic, no longer asking, "How do you like this?" but "What does this painter mean to show?" We might go forth and take fuller possession of the Exhibition and carry picture after picture away safely stored in the galleries of memory, (p. 5) Though Victorian artists had found successful ways of popularizing art, they never discovered a way to popularize truly artistic values. The artists Geddes most admired did not place in the poll when every man became his own art critic. The reasons are summed up in Claude Phillips' less rapturous and more realistic view of Victorian art and the Jubilee Exhibition: We are made to see clearly the rise, progress, and extinction of a series of genuinely inspired movements of insurrection against the dull resurgent wave of the stale and unprofitable commonplace, generated in the past, as it is to a great extent maintained in the present by the depressing influence of an indifferent public, seeking in art nothing much more serious than the sensations provided by a holiday provincial tour, or the satisfaction derived from the careless inspection of a shop-print or an illustrated newspaper.16 16"The Progress of English Art as seen at the Manchester Exhibition," in Magazine of Art (1887), p. 43.</page><page sequence="31">222 / VICTORIAN POETRY List of Illustrations Grateful acknowledgement is made to the private and public owners identified below for kindly allowing their works to be reproduced in this article.
