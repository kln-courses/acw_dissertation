<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE, MIMETIC LANGUAGE GAMES AND THE SUBJECT OF FICTION* MOSHE RON Comparative Literature and English, Jerusalem 0. Despite its occasionally flamboyant or contrived rhetoric, the following is just a working-paper. It should be taken as no more than the record of work in progress.' 1. It is the premise, the main thesis and, I'm afraid, also the conclusion of this paper, that the concept of Free Indirect Discourse (henceforth FID)2 can be meaningful only within literary mimesis, and that its limits may be taken to mark some of the limits of the mimetic powers of language. I hope, neverthe- less, in the course of this presentation, to say a few things which may clarify the * Paper presented at Synopsis 2: "Narrative Theory and Poetics of Fiction," an international sym- posium held at the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics, Tel Aviv University, and the Von Leer Jerusalem Foundation, 16-22 June 1979. I would like to thank Shlomit Rimmon-Kenan, Brian McHale, Igal Kvart and Anita Mittwoch for helpful discussions, and Michael Govrin for an anecdote. 'This paper was intended for oral delivery, and in preparing it for publication in the present written form I have made no concerted effort to suppress its oral origins. The lapse of time, however, has brought home to me the blissful ignorance in which I untertook this work. My most remarkable oversight has been Claude Perruchot's paper (1975) which includes a detailed attack on Banfield's theory of FID from much the same philosophical stance taken here. Had I read Perruchot's work then, I might not have embarked on the polemic against Banfield and Kuroda's position on speakers, and perhaps not written this paper at all. Still, both the occasion and the itinerary are rather different, as are the languages used or mimicked in the present instance of discourse. I have not tried to rewrite the whole paper in accordance with newly acquired knowledge, but do try to rectify some omissions in the notes. 2The most complete survey, as well as critical account, is McHale (1978), which also has a very full bibliography. I believe, with McHale, that grammatical description alone cannot account for FID. As he writes, "The basic grammatical characteristics of FID-absence of reporting verb of saying/thinking, back-shift of tenses, conversion of personal and possessive pronouns, etc. - do not by themselves guarantee its being unequivocally distinguished from neutral (diegetic) narration in which only the narrator's voice is present" (264). He then goes on to list indices by which readers can recognize segments of discourse as FID under the headings: grammar, intonation, context, idiom and register, content. ?

The argument I am proposing involves a weaker claim, which I hope will be found quite reasonable, and a stronger claim, which I despair in advance of imposing on this or any other audience. 2. My basic idea is simple enough: the use of FID is to seek to provide answers for questions concerning specific utterances in the mimetic text, such as: Whose words? Whose thoughts? Whose perceptions are these? Such answers are necessary in order to determine what is supposed to be happening in the story.3 Of course, they would not arise in the first place unless the utterances in question had been felt to be moot in respect of their attribution to a particular fictional subject. In order to make such decisions, FID utterances must be interpreted as embedded discourse. Such is roughly the weak claim. The stronger claim is that if the characterization of FID as embeddable discourse is rejected, then with it must go all possible formal stylistic distinctions which constitute the basis for narratological science, and that this is in fact the truth of the matter. The stronger claim thus cancels the weaker one in subsuming it, and this is an unfortunate circumstance which cannot be helped. 3. Mimesis is not, despite the desire that it might be or the illusion that it sometimes is, a representation of things as they are or happened. To say this is to flog a dead horse (which may never have been quite alive), but this does not make it any less true. Literary mimesis does not aim at truth, either as unveiling or as adequation. It is not a philosophical but a rhetorical language game: it aims at conveying an impression, creating an effect, persuading a possible reader that it is the semblance of true discourse. A mimetic text is, in a broad sense, like a set of instructions for constructing a fictional world. This "world" would consist of representations not essentially different from those a reader may make himself of the "real" world in any major respect other than his being able to characterize them as fictional. Let us call this practice the Mimetic Language Game (MLG).4 Let us also say that MLG is played by a Mimetic Author (MA) and a possible Mimetic Reader (MR) in Mimetic Texts (MT). The world at large, the real world, is not part of this game except in so far as it may shape what MR is likely to take as "true" (i.e., as having a reference within the fictional world). In accordance with Menakhem Perry's happy formulation (and long Formalist and New-Critical traditions), I propose to consider the text as a metonymy of both author and reader and at least as the most readily available evidence for their involvement in the mimetic game. I cannot, within the scope of this paper, list my reasons for applying the notion 3Van Dijk (1976) writes: "Sometimes, however, it is not easy to decide whether an utterance within a literary text is in fact meant as an utterance of the speaker-author himself or meant as an utterance of a represented possible object (human) of which the existence has not explicitly been asserted, but which could be presupposed by the utterance" (52). In this paper I suggest that the concept of FID is a tool in making such decisions. 4My use of the notion of Language Game was inspired by Sellars 1963 [1954]. Cf. also Zemach 1979 [1976] and Kvart's commentary on it. This is not to claim that I use Sellars' model, or even all of its features which are adaptable for the purpose at hand.</page><page sequence="3">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 19 of "language game," with its particular philosophical history, to the problem of mimesis. MLG is a game; it is nowhere claimed here that it is the only game played in literary texts, nor even that there is any particular text in which it is played exclusively. It is also not denied that a mimetic text may have an ulterior teleological function (whose fulfillment may or may not depend on its MLG properties). 4. It is no wonder then that MLG should borrow - some might say 'usurp' - modes of discourse which are or ought to be the lawful property of truth- oriented statements such as philosophy or history might wish to make. MTs would then seek to simulate the truth conditions of such modes of discourse. First among these is the pretense to fulfill the requirements of formal coher- ence, notably avoidance of internal contradiction. It is true that this require- ment is not as rigorously enforced in literary texts as it is expected to be in philosophical texts. Still, accidental or deliberate failure to live up to it is ipso facto a breakdown of MLG, if this failure is definitive for a particular MT, and if the inconsistency is of sufficient importance in the general economy of the text's meaning. Thus in Robinson Crusoe the same period of time (Crusoe's landing and his first days on the island) is narrated twice, first as a retrospective memoir, then as a daily journal, with numerous inconsistencies of detail. This did not seem to bother those of Defoe's contemporary readers who took the book for a true historical account (to the point of asking him to produce the real Robinson Crusoe). To a more pedantic MR or to an analyst of MLG, Defoe's very hesitation between the memoir and the diary forms may seem the clumsy move of a hesitant or inexperienced player. 5. Secondly, mimesis has traditionally sought to simulate true discourse not by attempting pseudo-adequate representation but by appealing to probability. The latter, as has been argued by countless theoreticians of mimesis from Aristotle on, is far more effective for MLG than what Henry James, for instance, scornfully called "the fatal futility of fact." In inventing, selecting and arranging materials into a MT, MA would therefore limit himself to what he considers his potential readership would consider probable. An earnest MA would certainly have to abide at least by what the epistemological climate around him allows as possible in what is taken to be the real world. The most famous dispute about the enforcement of this rule in the history of English fiction arose around a certain detail in Dickens' Bleak House. In the Preface to the first edition, the author defended himself as follows: The possibility of what is called Spontaneous Combustion has been denied since the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes (quite mistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters to me at the time when the event was chronicled, arguing that Spontaneous Combustion could not possibly be. I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers, and that before I wrote the description I took pains to investigate the subject. There are about thirty cases on record, of which the most famous, that of the Countess Cornelia de Bandi Cesante was minutely investigated and described by Guiseppe Bianchi [...] The ap-</page><page sequence="4">20 MOSHE RON pearances beyond all rational doubt observed in that case, are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook's case. The next most famous instance happened at Rheims [. .] I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable Spontaneous Combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received [quoted from Wall, 1970:94-5]. The reference is of course to the spontaneous combustion of the alcohol- suffused human body of a person who drank too much. The late Mr. Krook was a fictional character. 6. The probability requirement means that any question concerning the exis- tence of fictional individuals or the occurrence of fictional events (fictional individuals and/or events are henceforth abbreviated FIE) in a mimetic story can be met with an acceptable "that's why" or "that's how," in other words, be motivated without violation of any widely-held beliefs of the envisaged or merely possible readership about the nature of reality, causation, natural laws, human motives and so on. This is, roughly speaking, what the Russian Formal- ists termed "realistic motivation," whether or not such justification was explicitly present in the text. According to the Tel Aviv School of Poetics, such motiva- tions, which they now call 'frames,' are typically not explicitly present in the text. In the process of reading the reader constructs hypotheses motivating the presence or co-presence of items in the text. These are modeled on frames of references derived from lived or literary experience and not necessarily spelled out in the text (see Perry, 1979: passim, which also includes a bibliography of earlier contributions in Hebrew and English by Hrushovski, Perry and Sternberg; a similar view of the reading process is used in Rimmon, 1977 for defining the concept of narrative ambiguity). 7. But the principle of probability might also be taken to mean that MR is entitled to have another sort of question answered. MR may wish to know how FIE could have or did become known to any living person, be it MA or one of his fictional characters. MR may even go as far as wishing to know whether such FIE are at all knowable. As knowledge of these FIE might involve perception of objects of experiencing of sensations, similar queries, both in the actual and the potential form, may be formulated in terms of perceptions or experience. MR might then want to be persuaded, in addition to the probability or the possibility that FIE could have occurred, that it should also be probable or possible for it to be perceived or experienced. A further complication may arise if MR makes a fuss over awareness of FIE as opposed to mere perception of them, spontaneous vs. reflective consciousness, etc. 8. To pre-empt such demands, MA may feel constrained to supplement the FIE "already" included in the pseudo-referential field constituted by the text by another, supplementary set of FIE: individuals capable of knowing or ex- periencing the primary FIE in some cognitive act or event. Let us abbreviate the whole complex of "questions" and "answers" relating to the cognition of FIE, whether explicit or merely implied, as Epistemic Motivations (EM). 9. Translating this into the taxonomy proposed by Genette (1972) as refined by Bal (1977), one could say that, in some MTs, anthropomorphic focalizers act as</page><page sequence="5">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 21 EM for focalized objects. It may even be suggested that the introduction of such focalizers, which are somehow felt to be particularly convincing, may be used to compensate for the inclusion of objects suspected of being particularly weak with regard to the requirement of probability. This is not to deny, however, the possibility that "once" focalizers are "introduced" into the game as EM for objects, dominance may shift to them, so that we may have to reverse the terms of our description. We may then prefer to consider the focalized objects as mere motivation, sometimes no more than a flimsy excuse, for focusing attention of the focalizers themselves. One implication of this possibility will be briefly touched upon in 17. below. 10. But MR may not be satisfied with EM and may persist in raising difficul- ties, this time not with the probable cognition of such FIE, but with the possibility or actual process of the reporting of these FIE. Here, too, the problem may be negotiated either in terms of general or in terms of empirical statements, and these again may explicitly figure in the text or be reconstructed by MR in the process of concretization. The issue is furthermore separable into at least two separate questions. Assuming that FIE "occurred," "was ex- perienced" or "perceived" and "became the object of awareness or knowledge of some particular subject," still this FIE could not reach an absent, distant MR (a) unless it were recorded or registered, rescued from the fleeting unique- ness of its moment in the process of becoming and entrusting to a lasting - i.e., repeatable - medium of representation (of which writing is the classical para- digm); (b) unless this record "then" became the object of an act of communica- tion, a mesage directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally, having MR as its destination. 11. To forestall potential objections to these types, MA could introduce into his fictional world, or MR supplement it with, "in addition" to the focalized and focalizing FIE, which are "already there," yet a third set of FIE, individuals who are writers or speakers, objects which are texts or speeches, events such as written or oral speech acts. This third set of supplementary FIE would fall under the heading of 'narrative instance' in Genette's system.5 In the tripartite division of semiotics suggested by Morris, the problem of narrative instance would have found itself most naturally ranged under the heading of pragmatics. More recently, it has begun to straddle the borderline between pragmatics and semantics. Van Dijk (1976:52) writes: "Just as the discourse may construct possible worlds, the discourse may construct possible contexts by directly or indirectly referring to conversations occurring in the constructed worlds."6 -This account seems to me to be in no major conflict with the diagram devised by Bal (1977:116), which provides a rationalized, hierarchic representation of Genette's important distinction be- tween focalization and narrative instance. 6Van Dijk continues: "Since those constructed worlds need not be identical with the actual world, nor even be very similar in all respects, it is possible of course that the pragmatic rules of conversation differ from those holding in the actual world (in which the discourse is uttered). As far as I know the majority of literary texts, however, do not represent speech acts with essential different conditions as those holding in the actual world." This would be true, a fortiori, of texts aiming at a specifically mimetic effect.</page><page sequence="6">22 MOSHE RON This possible absorption of the narrative instance and other components of the pragmatic context into the fold of fictionality, when it occurs under the pressure of MLG, I propose to call Semiotic Motivation (SM). 12. In order to simplify (and at the risk of oversimplifying), let us sum up the gist of 5.-11., rather bluntly, as follows: basic MLG calls for probable in- dividuals and events, MLG with EM also calls for perceivers and perceptions, MLG with SM also calls for writers and texts. 13. I am aware that the need to maintain all or any of these distinctions has been called into question and even categorically denied in recent and not-so- recent epistemological discussions in more than one philosophical tradition. Yet all these distinctions, and no doubt others which I have overlooked, have at some period in the history of ideas been proposed and accepted as valid. As such they have beome part of common sense, widely-held beliefs concerning procedures for justifying existential assertions. Thus I might agree with Berkeley that to exist is no more than to be perceived, with the behaviorists that the concept of mind is empty and an obstacle to the progress of human knowlege, with Roland Barthes (admittedly a less rigorous epistemologist) when he writes: "le reel c'est ce qui a 6t6 6crit," etc. But literature is only seldom concerned with rigorous argumentations, arcane scepticisms or radical reduc- tions, contenting itself at best (always with some time lag),with their vulgarized, diffuse social effects which have already become part and parcel of empiricial reality. Mimetic texts, as I have suggested above, are not concerned with real truth (that philosopher's stone), but only with the semblance thereof. MT may thus naively try to shield itself from MR's scepticism (prompted perhaps by some philosophical argument which has managed to infiltrate pubic conscious- ness), by attempting to counter potential objections such as I have outlined. It may then include, in addition to utterances that make (implying or presupposing) statements of existence, utterances that make statements concerning the epis- temic and semiotic conditions which presumably gave rise to such utterances. And in MLG these count as motivations for the pseudo-true existentials which are the main moves of the game. The concept of 'motivation' belongs, of course, to a metalanguage analyzing the game rather than to the game itself. But the activity of motivating (consciously or not, explicitly or implicitly) constitutes the game itself. 14. Here is an excerpt from The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford (1927: 214): [(.. .) Leonora] went into Nancy's room. The girl was sitting perfectly still in an armchair, very upright, as she had been taught to sit at the convent. She appeared to be as calm as a church; her hair fell, black and like a pall, down over both her shoulders. The fire beside her was burning brightly; she must have just put coals on. She was in a white silk kimono that covered her to the feet. The clothes that she had taken off were exactly folded upon the proper seats. Her long hands were one upon each arm of the chair, that had a pink and white chintz back. Leonora told me these things.</page><page sequence="7">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 23 In relation to the existential assertions made in the apparently declarative sentences which make up this paragraph, the two sentences which frame it in my excerpt may be taken to constitute motivations of the two types I have tried to distinguish. The sentence preceding the paragraph counts as EM (answers questions such as: Was the girl perceived? Could she be perceived? Who perceived her?). The sentence following the quoted paragraph counts as SM (answers questions like: Who told the narrator these things? How did the detailed description of this scene become the object of an act of communica- tion?). 15. The analysis may be pursued further: this last sentence tells us of a speech act performed by Leonora with the narrator as the addressee, but it does so in order to motivate the narrator's knowledge of what he could not know at first hand (what happened out of his personal presence). This local EM, however, is contextually subordinate to a global SM, good for the whole text, which is that of the narrator's writing down of the memoir which constitutes the whole narrative for the reader. This is explicitly stated, for instance, in the paragraph which begins: "You may well ask why I write. And yet my reasons are many (Ford, 1927:5). These "reasons" would, in turn, count as psychological motivations, which as such belong to basic MLG (probability). Note that the reader may judge the narrator's stated reasons to be mere rationalizations or entirely spurious; the reader may then proceed to infer from his offering them other, more interesting or more convincing motives (according to some principles of human psychology which the reader considers more valid). Finally, to return to the descriptive passage itself, thus sandwiched between its EM and SM, one may venture to regard it all as FID. If so, it would be the type of FID considered marginal or rejected altogether by some theorists and discussed by McHale under the heading 'content' (1978:272).7 And as FID, it hovers among at least four possible readings: (a) the description represents Leonora's percep- tion of the room as she entered it; (b) it represents her verbal account of these perceptions; (c) it is the narrator's account of (a); (d) it is his account of (b). Of course, a MR determined to play MLG without EM or SM can still regard the passage simply as the narrator's description of the room and the girl in it, without stopping to fret over the relays through which the sense data con- stituting it had to pass before entering MLG through this MT. In this reading there would be no FID, no higher consciousness or performative verb, just plain declarative sentences, "written" by the narrator and addressed to no one. 16. Here two problems arise. 'This criterion is explained with reference to the central tenet of Bakhtin's 'translinguistics,' "which is that the perceptibility of represented discourse does not depend on stylistic/formal signals of any kind (grammatical, contextual, lexical) but rather on the recognition of an utterance's orientation toward some other utterance. For Bakhtin, the 'content' of an utterance - not the local meanings of its constituent words and sentences, but its global reflection of a dialogic relationship with some other utterance - is the only important sign of its mimetic (citational) character." Without accepting Bakhtin's wholesale dismissal of formal signals, I believe that this notion of 'content' should form part of a larger concept of 'context.'</page><page sequence="8">24 MOSHE RON 17. If EM and SM appear in their actual version, i.e., assert that a particular mental or semiotic FIE actually existed or occurred in the fictional world, then these, too, become existential statements about that fictional world. As such, they, too, may require motivation, and the possibility of an infinite regress seems to open up. In fact there are some literary texts which quite deliberately hurl themselves down such an abyss. The status of such texts vis-a-vis MLG has to do with the willingness of MR to recognize that epistemology itself (not just rhetoric) is vitiated in the same way. If MR believes that the structure of the world or the structure of experience precludes paradox (e.g., infinite regress), then he will refuse to accept such a text as mimetic and will consider it, for better or for worse, as having opted out of MLG. 18. The problem is perhaps less acute with EM than with SM. Common sense tends to conceive of 'knowing' (and more so of 'knowledge') as (a) something other than an event in the world in that it may remain "mental" or "private"; (b) not a singular event in that it represents a fixed relation to a fixed content ("He goes to school" pointed to a routine of singular going-to-school events, but "He knows where the school is" is not usually taken to point to any single act or event) (c) consequently, being in principle free of any specific existential relation to the event which is its object, so that one would only rarely be tempted, in fiction, to make assertions of the form "He knew that he knew." The temptation does arise in texts which focus on several anthropomorphic focalizers focalizing each other. This may tax the reader's understanding, as in James's late novels, but does not properly constitute an infinite regress. With 'experiencing' or 'perceiving' the situation is just the reverse of (c) above, but with the same consequences for MLG. These are commonly held to be insepara- ble from the event itself, so that no time lag is supposed to separate the 'perceiving of a' from the 'existence of a.'8 The narrative possibilities of an infinite regress based on the recursion of "Hei perceived that hei perceived" or even the more likely "Hei perceived that hej perceived" seem less than exciting. 'Finding out' or 'becoming known' are supposed to be singular events which may lag behind FIE. This makes them better candidates for long, confusing recursive chains. 19. Infinite regresses are more likely to open with SM, acts such as 'writing,' 'narrating,' 'speaking,' etc. These, like 'knowing,' may be without any direct existential relation to the event which is their object and are thus clearly separable from it (unlike 'perceiving'); but unlike 'knowing' they are neces- sarily public and thus are more easily said actually to occur. Their status as singular events is further complicated by their being in principle repeatable or quotable (sign/replica or type/token opposition). For example a MT making the "original" report of FIE in a certain language, say Arabic (in a particular semiotic substance, say writing, on a specific kind of parchment etc., etc.), may "Although our epistemological horizon includes the possibility that a distant star may be actually extinct by the time its light has sped the distance to our perceiving organ. For this to be used as EM very special FIE would have to be constructed, and no doubt were, in some work of SF not known to me.</page><page sequence="9">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 25 be copied onto paper, read aloud or rendered by a drawing, translated into another language, say Spanish, edited according to certain principles of poetics by a Second Author, plagiarized centuries later, say by a certain Pierre Menard (as reported by a reviewer who remains anonymous, but who is characterized as holding reactionary political opinions although not as writing in any one language) and all this faithfully or unfaithfully, wholly or in part. By the time the series has regressed that far - and has been dislocated from either its real and fictional origin - it becomes virtually infinite. 20. The second problem arises from the fact that both EM and SM may be not explicitly present ("included" or "contained") in MT, and yet may be construed from it by MR in the process of concretization. In terms of MLG, disputes may arise as to the nature of the game being played: is it basic MLG, or is it MLG cum EM and/or SM? Such a dispute appears to be the one between those who conceive of certain sentences as speakerless and of certain texts as narratorless (the reference is of course to the Kuroda-Banfield school)9 and the rest of mankind, who assume, traditionally, that every speech has a speaker and every text an author, whether or not that speech or text includes a word referring to its producer explicitly. Things would be simple enough if we could say that the parties to this dispute are using the same MT to play different variaties of MLG. The narratorless people would wish to play plain old MLG, when the others barge in with their "effaced narrator hypothesis" (as Banfield, 1973:1, scornfully calls it). The question remains whether this effaced narrator, once reinscribed in the readerly text, can be so easily legislated away. It may be arguable that as soon as the poetics of MLG is adulterated under philosophical pressure, by epistemological considerations there is no turning back. This would be, however, at best an interpretation of the history of poetics and not a rule of thumb of any sort. 21. Another attempt to arbitrate the dispute might be to point out that the speakerful position seems to have been in mind actual utterances, whereas the speakerless school speak of sentences and texts, cut off from any specific context. But the categories of token/type and act/object are notoriously difficult to define and maintain consistently when it comes to written texts. The fact is that confusions of both these categories are not infrequent on either side. I have done my best to talk of utterances of sentences and to favor, whenever possible, the token and act meaning of 'utterance.' I would grant that for some texts, considered as MT, there just does not seem to be much point in activating an "effaced narrator hypothesis." I would nevertheless like to argue against the imposition of speakerlessness by force of either descriptive or prescriptive grammatical legislation. 10 'Cf. Kuroda (1973, 1976) and Banfield (1973, 1978a, b). For Banfield (1973:1) a speaker must be 'contained' in a text. According to her (1978a:296) the SPEAKER would still be 'contained' in an independent sentence if it lurked in its "deep structure." I do not believe that "deep structure" is the only place where speakers can withdraw from sight. Need one note the apparent absurdity of talking about "speakerless sentences [and thus presumably narratorless texts] of pure narration" (Banfield, 1978a:302)? "'The following passage seems to me to betray (the writer's?) confusion of grammatical with</page><page sequence="10">26 MOSHE RON 22. It may be recalled that the prime example adduced by Banfield and Kuroda for the existence of a categorically narratorless style is precisely FID. I would like to claim that textual segments identified as FID, and hence MT where such segments are prominent, must be read as MLG with either EM of SM or both. In its briefest form my argument is this: FID segments represent FIE which are act-token utterances or quasi-utterances (specific speech-, thought- or perception-events). The uttering of an utterance presupposes an utterer (the thinking of a thought a thinker, the perceiving of a perception a perceiver). Only sentences uttered by no one may be said to be speakerless in a trivial sense (like the sections of the Library of Babel to which no librarian had any access). 23. It seems a little odd in this day and age to be arguing against the view that a text must mean what it says and only what it says (and under a very narrow definition of 'saying' at that; see, for instance Banfield, 1978a:296). In concre- tizing MT, MR is constantly led to formulate hypotheses, which go a long way beyond what MR actually says. Compared to some of the elaborate frames MR may construct out of MT, occasionally stretching his own epistemological principles, the following points seem almost trivial: (a) every utterance presup- poses a speaker as part of its pragmatic context (and every statement of fact an alleged knower - who may be wrong); (b) the uses of third-person pronouns, such as he, she, or they normally mean (or indicate or presuppose) that the subject of the sentence is not co-referential with its speaker. " That the potential pragmatic-epistemological considerations: "But how can the narrator assert, tell, etc. about the subject of the point of view's act and its propositional content? If the act is an 'outer' act, i.e., one perceivable from the outside by the outer senses, e.g., say, the narrator presumably perceives the act and reports it to the reader. If the act is an 'inner' act of a character, the narrator, if he is assumed to be equipped only with human facilities, cannot directly perceive the act and report it to the reader. Grammatically speaking, we do not know the grounds on which the narrator makes his assertions about the acts of characters" (Kuroda, 1976:113-4; my italics - M.R.). Can we ever know the grounds on which assertions are made, grammatically speaking? As Wittgenstein demonstrated, epistemology (let alone grammar) cannot forbid us to say, "Charley has a stomachache" (even though as an "inner sensation" Charley's stomachache ought to be his own inalienable property). It is only a Hemingway who imposes such a restriction upon himself, not universal grammar. That the self-imposition of such restrictions is to be traced back to the epistemological climate where it occurs is undeniable, but according to my view it is a part of poetics (prescriptive, at that, and not always borne out by rigorous description). I Benveniste, claimed as a founding father of speakerlessness, gave the following definition of the first person: "Je signifie 'la personne qui 6nonce la pr6sente instance de discours contenant je.' Instance unique par d6finition, et valable seulement dans son unicit'" (1966 [19561:252). There is an effort here to stay with the act-token. French linguists have for a long time maintained an elegant (if not always adequate) distinction between "sujet de l'6nonciation' and 'sujet de l'Nnonc6.' If this opposition were all the work Banfield wanted to get from her pair of terms 'SPEAKER' and 'SELF,' much of the dispute would have been a quibble over terminology. But clearly she wants more: "Divorce of SPEAKER and SELF: If there is a first person in an E who is representing or echoing another E already heard by this SPEAKER, then the SPEAKER may relinquish his prerogative as SELF and the referent of the heard interlocutor may be co-referential with SELF." She adds to this rule: "The above principle analyzes the first person into two functions, SPEAKER and SELF, one embodying the communicative role and the other, the expressive" (Banfield, 1978b:437-8).</page><page sequence="11">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 27 existence of some EM and SM (some focalizer and some narrative instance) is thus a presupposition of any MT does not indeed mean that these must be full concretized (certainly not personified) for every MT. But I shall try to demon- strate that at least one of them must be concretized for MT featuring FID (if it is to count as mimetic at all). In other words: a MT featuring FID is either playing MLG with EM, or playing MLG with SM (or both), or it is no MT and is not playing MLG at all, in which case the concept of FID no longer serves any purpose. 24. Banfield comes closest to this position is discussing a passage from D. H. Lawrence's "England, My England" (1973:35; quoted again in 1978a:294). She there admits that "there is no formal ground for ruling out a narrator in texts using the free indirect style" (my italics). Of another passage in the same text she writes (1973:29): "We are not forced by the line 'It took him hours even to ask the question' to imagine that the character who ponders the three preced- ing questions has been trying for hours to enumerate or visualize these very words." What then was he trying to do? In some shape or form these questions must have been on his mind (his mind), or else the text is not a representation of anything in particular. I agree that it is not possible to determine with any certainty just who is responsible for the verbal form of the questions in question. I am suggesting that in opting out of this decision Banfield joins Lawrence in opting out of MLG with SM, but not out of MLG with EM. Thus here we must postulate a narrator (whom, in this case, I see no need to distinguish from the author), who happens to be an excitable chap (some of the expressive signals can be ascribed to him), in addition to the dying Egbert; but we willingly suspend our doubts about the specific form of Egbert's alleged stream-of-consciousness and the way it might have been communicated to the narrator. To meet the minimal requirement for EM it is sufficient to pin the thought de re onto some fictional consciousness (some focalizer). When MR cannot tell which consciousness it is, the expressive narrator's or the equally expressive character's, then the text is said to have violated a rule of MLG.'2 25. In order to elaborate this point I would like to mobilize Grice's well- known model for the logic of conversation (1975 [1965]). I would like to suggest that MLG is governed by a general principle not unlike Cooperation Principle (CP), and which I hereby name the Mimetic Cooperation Princi- ple (MCP). " The CP for conversation - and indeed for any communica- tion between reasonable, well-intentioned persons - consists in a number of maxims which Grice groups under the four Kantian categories of Quantity, Quality, Relation and Manner. An adequate description of MLG would have to formulate rules for it, which would roughly correspond to Grice's rules for 'Banfield's discussion of this passage is admirably discussed by Perruchot (1975:261). 'Van Dijk suggests that "perhaps together with a class of speech acts of the expressive assertional type (confessions, complaints, descriptions, narrations, etc.) it should range under a more general, higher principle, viz. the assumed Construction Principle" (1976:50). I believe that if the conversa- tional model is to be maintained at all, any Construction Principle must remain subordinate to the general CP. The suggested MCP may be interpreted as a tacit convention to cooperate in constructing a fictional world.</page><page sequence="12">28 MOSHE RON conversation. These would state the limits within which "the willing suspension of disbelief' required by MLG can operate. As with conversation, the reader of a MT may find that it violates a maxim, or that there is a clash between two maxims, or that a maxim is being flouted. In fact it is very possible that one of the special rules for MLG should state that there should appear to be as many failures as possible to conform to various maxims (e.g., in ways enumerated by van Dijk, 1976:46), without, however, violating the MCP as a whole. 26. Now it is in attempting to reconcile with the CP apparent failures to fulfill maxims that Grice's rational conversationalists comprehend each other's meaning by implicature. On the analogy of Grice's definition, the following may serve as a definition of mimetic implicature: A Mimetic Author who, by (in, when) saying (or making as if to say) that p, has implicated that q, PROVIDED THAT (1) he is to be presumed to be observing the mimetic maxims, or at least the cooperative principle; (2) the supposition that he is aware that, or thinks that, q is required in order to make his saying or making as if to say p consistent with this presupposition; and (3) the Mimetic Author thinks (and would expect the Mimetic Reader to think that the Mimetic Author thinks) that it is within the competence of the Reader to work out or grasp intuitively, that the supposition mentioned in (2) IS required. I see no need at present to amend this definition so as to reconcile it with what I believe should be retained of the intentional fallacy argument (this task, if at all possible, would involve the very foundations of speech-act theory). Let it merely be said, at this point, that obviously some mimetic texts require higher standards of rigor and more demanding inference skills than others. 27. I would like now to proceed to a discussion of apparent violations of one particular maxim in MLG. I believe that Grice's supermaxim Quality - "Try to make your contribution one that is true" - and the first specific maxim which falls under it - "Do not say that which you believe to be false" 14 - may be imported into MLG with the following modification: "Try to make your contribution one that can count as 'true' in this fictional world," and "Do not say that which must count as 'false' in this fictional world."" 'Contribution' here may refer to both what MA says and what MR finally construes from it. If MR must construe from what MA says a meaning which will definitively count as 'false' in that MT, then the maxim has been broken. If the issue is sufficiently prominent, MLG has been opted out of, and the reader, no longer MR, must seek the text's coherence through some other model or convention. 28. According to this view, a MT may exhibit the spectacle of acts of com- munication, e.g., conversations, but also other verbal or non-verbal transac- tions where some of the parties violate the CP itself, most typically, its truth maxims.'6 I mean really violate: lie, cheat, mislead, etc., in ways that no "4The second - "Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence" - would seem to apply mainly to MLG with EM. "It has been pointed out to me by Allon White that trying "to make your contribution one that can count as true" is just what a liar does. 'IVan Dijk: "What is much more often the case is a manipulation of more general conversational</page><page sequence="13">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 29 reasonable and well-meaning person would never do. MT may also present the spectacle of acts of cognition which happen to fail, without indicating this failure at the time (or rather the place in the text-continuum). But the text as a whole, as a possible message in the possible dialogue MA-MR, cannot violate the MCP without opting out of the MLG altogether (which is indeed a tautology). This goes for what it says as well as for what it implicates, the later being often the only resource for a friendly MR to exonerate it from such charges. The characteristic Western MR is not unconditionally credulous, but his acceptance of the MCP means that he cannot be a persistently hostile fault- finder. A MT may thus contain a communication network violating the CP, but the text itself, to be mimetic, must be readable in accordance with the MCP. 29. Unpacking this into plain English one might say that the author of a mimetic fiction may not lie to the reader directly (within the boundaries of the fictional world), but may use the lying of his characters to mislead the reader temporarily. 30. Hence it is of capital importance with regard to the MCP to be able to establish, if necessary by implicature (or some such procedure), the identity of the speaker of each textual segment (of the alleged knower of each bit of information). This is obviously essential for concretizing such central meanings of the MT as the characters it presents. But it is even more essential (if that were possible), for an even more important purpose, that of determining whether MLG is being played at all. For this purpose MR must be able to distinguish utterances or quasi-utterances (information or pseudo-information) that are in the text from the utterance or parts thereof (the message or parts thereof) which IS the text. 31. One possible terminology for making this distinction is to talk of the included utterances (those which may violate the CP without violating the MCP) as embedded within a higher utterance. Sentences or expressions con- sidered unembeddable by linguists may be used in utterances which are sub- ordinated in a specific pragmatic context, such as the reconstructed "reality" of an MT, to another utterance which dominates it. If the term 'embed' is claimed by linguists as their private property, I could readily resort to a more traditional literary term like 'frame' or 'encase.' 32. It must be insisted upon that for mendacious character statements to be framed by a higher, "true" (in the conventional sense of "world-creating"), authorial voice, there need not occur in the text's extension any segment of discourse which is directly assigned to the author and not to any of the characters. Thus all the characters in a play may be deceiving or deceived in saying that p, but the author, far from saying that p may be implicating that q (part of which is that p is false in that fictional world). In fact, it is on charges of violating the CP and related norms that we have learnt to accuse (following principles: characters may speak without respecting the truth, may speak in an obscure or ambiguous way, may provide too much or too little information, etc., often with the same non- conventional implicatures as discussed by Grice" (1976:52). Cf. also Barthes (1970:137-9) on 'lignes de destination."</page><page sequence="14">30 MOSHE RON Booth, 1961) certain narrators of unreliability, assuming almost as a matter of fact that texts in which such a narrator is the only apparent "speaker" are in no violation of the MCP. Note that Booth correctly intuits (although fails to provide a convincing stylistic analysis) that this holds both for stories "told" by "narrators" and for stories "filtered" through a "center of consciousness" (in terms of MLG, with or without a global SM). Notions such as 'Implied Author' and 'Narrator' (when not clearly a fictional character) have been invented and used to keep MA outside the text and thus immune to any questioning. I am suggesting that MA enjoys this privilege of immunity only ex officio, and that he cannot abuse it too often without losing his office and finally undermining the whole institution. But in order to fit a certain utterance into the frame of the MCP, MR may assume the implicature of a higher-level utterance in which the apparently offending sentence or expression would be embedded. Or, in other words still, MR may construct a higher narratorial instance as the only way of making sense out of the story. " 33. I am aware that the attempt by Ross (1970) to argue that all declarative sentences are at the deep level embedded in higher-level performative main clauses has not met with the universal approval of his colleagues. I would imagine that the impulse for advancing such a theory may have something to do with my concern here. But the possible failure of the performative analysis within TG linguistics has no serious consequences for the view proposed here. I do not claim that all or even some texts have anything like a "deep structure" (whether syntactic or semantic) where the higher performative verb is actually present, merely that playing MLG cum EM and SM forces MR to construe one for certain texts in order to reconcile them with the MCP. 34. It seems to me that in characterizing what he calls "the communicational theory" of narration as one "according to which each sentence of a story represents the content of an act of judgment by the narrator or a character," Kuroda (1976:123) sets up a straw man. True, Don Quixote was incensed by some acts of ill-judgment simulated by Maese Pedro's puppets. But was there ever a theorist so credulous as to pretend that each sentence in a novel is meant as a direct assertion of fact about empirical reality? Has anyone ever seriously believed or asserted that Henry Fielding (1707-1754) seriously believed or asserted that Tom Jones (17**-17**) really existed? According to the view presented here, declarative sentences about Tom Jones or Mr. Krook do represent an "act of judging," but not of the kind set up by Kuroda for easy demolition. What these declarative sentences represent (by metonymy) are '7This is just one of several points made by Culler (1975:200) in his fine discussion of naturaliza- tion in the novel: "identifying narrators is one of the primary ways of naturalizing fiction. The convention that in a text the narrator speaks to his readers acts as support to interpretive operations which deal with the odd or apparently insignificant [. ..] But even when there is no narrator who describes himself we can explain almost any aspect of the text by postulating a narrator whose character the elements in question are designed to reflect or reveal.

I am now turning to the discussion of some examples of FID. 36. The speakerless theory of FID has some difficulty accounting for exam- ples of this style which do appear to contain a first person. After seemingly denying the possibility of such occurrences in her earlier work (1978a:196), Banfield (1978b:432-4) discusses them as "violations of the priority of SPEAKER." Here, then, is one such violation: [11 She's on the floor, dancing with a dark-skinned fellow who is holding her close. [2] As soon as the dance is out I rush over to her. [3] "Where were you?" I ask. [41 "What was the matter? [5] Why didn't you come?" [61 She seemed surprised that I should get so upset over so trivial a thing. [71 What had kept her? [8] Oh, it was nothing at all. [9] She had been out late, a rather wild party [. . .] not with Carruthers [. . .1 he had left shortly after me. [10] No, it was Florrie who had organized the party. [11] Florrie and Hannah - did I remember them? [12] (Did remember them? [131 Florrie the nymphomaniac and Hannah the drunken sot. [141 How could I forget them?) [15]Yes, there had been a lot to drink and somebody had asked her to do the splits and she had tried .. ..] well, and she had hurt herself a bit.[16] That was all. [17] I should have realized that something had happened to her. [18] She wasn't the sort who made dates and broke them - just like that (Miller, 1965:69-70). Sexus is a retrospective first-person narrative, and in this passage the narrator (=Henry Miller; but cf. Booth, 1961:367) is beginning to make the discovery that Mara is a pathological liar (one of Miller's real-life friends called the real- life Mara "the bag of lies"). According to Banfield's theory, she should be the dominant SELF in the second paragraph. The expressive elements in the second paragraph are all hers: the inverted questions of [7] and [11], the unembedded "Oh," "No" and "Yes" of [8], [10] and [15], respectively, the unfinished sentences, etc. To account for such phenomena Banfield (1978b: 432) reminds us that she defines "point of view as the NP associated with expressive constructions and not, circularly, as the first person." That NP in this case is she and its reference is Mara. But would any slightly skilled MR mistake this passage for a representation of her point of view? The passage is clearly an indictment of her as a bag of lies, from his point of view; and the way it is done is by representing her speech (which ought to have expressed her point of view, but is interpreted as inconsistent with the truth as she must kow it and so does not coincide with her "mental state") from his point of view; and the way this is done is through FID. Need it be asserted that this text is ironic? I would argue that the ironic effect is indeed achieved by superimposing one speaker over another and one point of view over another in one utterance against Banfield's rules of "1I/1E(xpression)" and "1SELF/1E" (e.g., 1978a: 290). Transforming the passage into Direct Discourse would eliminate, pri- marily, not information concerning the fictional events (the conversation), nor any expression of the character's (Mara's) alleged point of view (certainly not</page><page sequence="16">32 MOSHE RON "Stream of Consciousness"), but rather the expression of the speaker/writer's disbelief, rage, sarcasm and so on. 37. Take [7], which is an echo-question, re-echoed in FID. It "contains" two speakers in the sense (a) that a speaker rather than the referent of she is presupposed by this use of a third-person pronoun; and (b) that the pragmatic context represented in the text indicates that it is the referent of she who "was" responsible for the inverted question de dicto. As reconstructed by MR, [7] represents or implicates the following bit of dialogue: Henry: "What kept you?" Mara: "What kept me?" And it further implicates, to the scrupulous MR, that this dialogue is em- bedded in a report in FID, made at a later time. Note that the question does not exactly echo any of the already-quoted questions in [3], [4] and [5], so that the 'original' question is merely implied. Note also that in attributing an echo- question to Mara, Henry insinuates that she is stalling for time and hence may not be telling the truth. Now [12], as opposed to [11], represents an echo- question by Henry, which may have been impatiently uttered (the deleted pronoun) or just crossed his mind at the time. But the NOW of this expressive E may also be thought of as contemporaneous not with the dialogue but with the act of writing about it (writing down some parts of it) perhaps years later. So that here the retrospective narrator represents his own speech or thought in FID. In other words, the 'I' of an FID sentence (or E) need not coincide with itself, in the sense that such a sentence may superimpose two distinct speech acts, a reported speech act and a reporting speech act, made at two different times (anchored to two different NOWs). The reporter of the reported speech act may be a very different person from the one who originally committed it (perhaps autobiographical narratives may be seen as stories of the transforma- tion leading from the one to the other, from the usually naive narrated narrator to the presumably disillusioned narrating narrator qualified to represent the self-image MA wishes to project). This example may be analyzed further, but not now. 38. In the example from Sexus the pragmatic context provided by the text by way of SM usually disambiguates the relative status of the utterances and messages involved. Here is an example where MA keeps MR waiting for many pages before the pragmatics of a passage can retrospectively receive a correct reading. The example is from Great Expectations (like Sexus globally moti- vated as a retrospective first-person narrative), and Mr. Jaggers is just about to make a dramatic announcement: 'Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to make is, that he has great expectations.' Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another. 'I am instructed to communicate to him,' said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at me sideways, 'that he will come into a handsome property. Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor or that property, that he be immediately removed</page><page sequence="17">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 33 from his present sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman - in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations.' My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale (Dickens, 1963 [1860-1]:165). Upon first reading this passage MR would tend to read all of the segments which are not in quotation marks in the same way, i.e., as the narrating- narrator's declarative discourse. But this is of course true of the last para- graph.'" When he reaches p. 336 (out of a total of 493) MR will find out that the mysterious benefactor was Magwitch rather than Miss Havisham. That Pip should have falsely believed at the time that it had been she is psychologically motivated in many ways irrelevant to this paper. The last paragraph in this excerpt is FID, and in a second reading must be construed by the reader as dominated by a higher verb like 'believed.' Note also that in this reconstructed version an expression like 'sober reality' makes sense only in an opaque reading (a reading where the propositional content of the embedded - reporting - discourse). Any other reading of this last paragraph convicts the narrator, with the MA close behind him, of breaking the truth-maxim of the MCP. The MA is deeply implicated in this affair because in many places, throughout the text, he allows the narrator speak of his former self as having been mistaken (for example, on the very first page of the novel). What we have here is an implicit local EM (it was the young Pip who believed that p) within an explicit global SM (the mature Pip's autobiographical narration) embracing the entire extension of the text. Why does MA make the narrator equivocate precisely at this point? The answer to this question does not belong properly to MLG, although MLG can stretch to accomodate it. Had a verb like believed dominated the ambiguous paragraph, the reader would have known the truth at once (note also the failure to back-shift the tense, which might have had the same effect). Yet MT is usually, according to Philippe Hamon's mot juste, a text in a hurry (in a hurry to unload its plethora of information). When it stalls, equivocates or delays the introduction of relevant information (in blatant violation of all four conversational supermaxims) it does so from a primarily narrative, not a mimetic imperative. The precise ways in which MLG can accomodate interference with narrative language-games cannot be investigated here. 39. My next example, from Balzac's "Sarrasine," raises a similar problem, and has already been analyzed by Barthes. Sarrasine is about to see the castrato Zambinella for the first time. [1] 11 crut ecouter par chacun de ses pores. [2] Tout A coup, des applaudissements a faire crouler la salle accueillirent l'entr&amp;e en scene de la prima donna.

Daleski, an illustrious Dickensian, maintained, in conversa- tion with me, that the reader must be aware of the self-deceiving nature of this final paragraph at first reading. This would make Dickens amazingly optimistic about his readers' skill in inferring implicatures.</page><page sequence="18">34 MOSHE RON infinie. [4] Les Lumieres, I'enthousiasme de tout un peuple, l'illusion de la scene, les prestiges d'une toilette qui, a cette 6poque, 6tait assez engagenate, conspirterent en faveur de cette femme. [5]Sarrasine poussa des cris de plaisir. [6] II admirait en ce moment la beaut6 id6ale de laquelle il avait jusqu'alors cherch6 qa et la les perfection dans la nature, en demandant ' un modele, souvent ignoble, les rondeurs d'une jambe accomplie; a tell autre, les contours du sein; a celui-la, ses blanches 6paules; prenant enfin le cou d'une jeune fille, et les mains de cette femme, et les genoux polis de cette enfant, sans recontrer jamais sous le ciel froid de Paris les riches et suaves cr6ation de la Grece antique. [7] La Zambinella lui montrait r6unies, bien vivantes et d61icates, ces exquises proportions de la nature f6minine si ardemment d6sire6e, desquelles un sculpteur est tout a la fois le juge le plus s6vere et le plus passionn6 (Balzac, 1936 [1831, 18441: 95-6). Here is Barthes' comment on [3] and [4] excluding the last three words of [4]: Le discours, ici, ne ment pas: certes, il traite Zambinella comme une femme, mais en justifiant sa f6minit6 comme une impression, dont les causes sont indiqu6es (Barthes, 1970:117). The reference to 'cette femme' is glossed differently: En revanche, la chute de la phrase est bien un leurre (il euit suffit que le discours dit: l'artiste, pour qu'il n'efit pas 'a mentir): commence en verit6, la phrase se termine en mensonge (Barthes, 1970:118). 40. It seems to me that the word elle in [3] is not significantly less problematic than femme in [4]. I would suggest that the necessary EM (the procedure for justifying his being a woman as someone's impression, whose causes are indicated) may be found, with great difficulty, if parts of the passage are considered as FID (again, according to the 'content' criterion). The difficulty of doing so arises from (a) the fact the propositional content "Zambinella is a woman" is nowhere represented as either Sarrasine's speech or his thought process, but at best as his mere visual perception; (b) there is no verb of visual perception to facilitate the construction of a possible introductory phrase to the FID; (c) the relative clause modifying the word toilette in [4] could not originate from someone, like Sarrasine, who lived then (1758), but is no longer alive "now" (c. 1830); (d) sentences [1] through [5] are in passe simple, while French stylistics, to my knowledge, never allows in style indirecte libre - and their disqualification is further enhanced by contrast with the imparfait of [6] and [7]. Thus if [6] and [7] seem to imply that Zambinella actually had breasts, the concept of FID is readily available to transform these breasts into a figment of Sarrasine's imagination. But in the first of the quoted paragraphs, the narrator, and possibly MA himself, takes a great deal of liberty with the MCP. Still, given the overwhelming adherence of the text to various requirements of MLG, this can only be taken as a flaw in Balzac's performance as MA. There are several other interesting passages in this respect in "Sarrasine" (and a great many in Balzac's work as a whole) which I have not the space to discuss here. 42. McHale (1976:278) lists several references to discussions of FID which represents a character perception. He provides examples (from Dos Passos)</page><page sequence="19">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 35 and comments them in a way which seems valid also for "Sarrasine": "The procedure by which readers naturalize sense-impressions like these in terms of the free indirect rendering of a character's stream-of-consciousness is one of the most powerful means available for making sense out of otherwise 'insignifi- cant' details in a novel." The special interest of the example from Balzac is that (a) the perception concerns not an 'insignificant' detail, but the central narrative enigma of the text (this is also true of the example from Dickens in 38.); and (b) the attribution of the discourse to the fictional individual is so tenuous (if possible at all). This example, then, would mark one of the limits of FID (as distinct from plain authorial narration) and with it one of the limits of MLG. More than even a "powerful means" or a "principal strategy," FID here becomes a deus ex machina for the MT. 43. I can think of two other types of ambiguity involving FID, both of potentially crucial import for MLG. To illustrate these types long passages would have to be quoted and analyzed in detail, and this is not possible within the already-excessive scope of this paper. I believe that such passages exist in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady, and predict that even more complex ones will turn up in his later works. All I can do at present is mention these types of am- biguity: (1) Sentences containing a verb of consciousness or communication and thus formally indistinguishable from Indirect Discourse, where the verb of consciousness or communication may be attributed to either the reporting or the reported discourse. Resolving such ambiguities would be necessary to establish whether a character is being self-conscious is a particular way, or else being analyzed by the MA (or a narrator situated at a higher narrative in- stance). (2) Passages which force MR to construe utterances as FID embedded or framed within a higher instance of FID. Here the limits of the mimetic powers of language coincide with what can be plausibly rescued from an infinite regress where none of the stations is explicitly noted. My examples would show three, possibly four, instances of discourse or states of conscious- ness in addition to the highest narrative instance dominating the passage as a whole. 44. My final example comes from an underground classic entitled Posh. Beula Montezuma, a suburban California housewife, has spent the day pre- paring for her husband, Tony, a very special cake which, she hopes, will erect their hitherto inadequate relationship on a wholly new basis. [II] "Dinner is ready, all piping hot," she sang. [2] How her husband loved chicken a la king for dinner, especially when garnished with a peppery watercress salad. [31 What a change from hamburgers and French fries. [4] And when the meal was crowned with a light, savory angel food specialty cake, for him it was a total experience, a repast to be remembered. [5] "You look a bit out of sorts," he told his wife. "Apprehensive or something" (Gatos, 1971:21). Sentences [2]-[4] are in FID, and they are framed in this excerpt by two other sentences which "quote" the two characters' words in Direct Discourse. The so-called expressive elements in [2] would have to be attributed to her, based</page><page sequence="20">36 MOSHE RON on the transition from she in [1] to her husband in [21 (focusing on his relevance to her; although her husband is the subject of the sentence, she is still the topic of discourse). But what shall be said of [3]? As reconstructed by an overanxious MR, this might read: "She exclaimed inwardly, as she thought her husband would exclaim (were he able to verbalize his feelings on the subject): 'What a change from hamburgers and French fries."' Considered as a rep- resentation of her mental state, [3] naturally follows after [2]. So would [4] after [3]. But when the analysis gets to [5], where he is the focus (both the subject and the topic of the parenthetical "he told his wife" - rather than *"her husband told her"), it can backtrack through the sequence, using the same transitions to eliminate the implicated higher-instance clauses of which she was the postulated subject, substituting for them higher-instance clauses where he would be the subject. A third, distinctly less appealing, possibility would be to attribute the enthusiasm for this menu to an effaced narrator. There seems to be no formal ground for deciding between these readings. 45. I would nevertheless, having had the benefit of reading this edifying work in its entirety, tend to judge the first hypothesis to be correct. [2]-[4] are her FID. My grounds for saying so are entirely empirical. "All piping hot" (in DD), "chicken a la [sic] king," "garnished with," "a peppery watercress salad," "what a change from hamburger and French fries," "crowned with," "a light, savory angel food specialty cake," "for him," "a total experience," "a repast to be remembered" - what are all these? Who produced these utterances? Don't they sound sort of familiar? This patchwork of clich6s from women's magazines, soap opera and advertising can only point to the enterprising young wife (the husband will have turned out in the end to be a propagator of clich6s rather than a mere consumer). This pastiche is in fact the consciousness (if that is what you want to call it) of Beula Montezuma. But the contents of this person's mind are clearly not her own. Where are the original I's of these E's, the original SELFs of these sentiments? Fictional or real, they are nowhere present in the text, but their discourse subsists in it. What is it then that makes the anonymous manufacturers of this commercialized folklore so effective? Precisely the fact that their expressions are detachable from their "original" real or semiotic contexts and capable of being grafted into new organisms or texts. For readers alert or allergic to some specific type of discourse, cliches of this type will always trail behind them intimations of former glamor in another context. This works without enlisting any formal apparatus (neither syntactic subordination nor even quotation marks), just using the empty spacing be- tween words, the referential emptiness around words. And it would work in fundamentally the same way whether the discourse is oral or written. 46. Here then is the unlikely claim promised at the beginning (1): All imagin- able semiotic effects (including, of course, all linguistic effects) are characterized by the three main properties attributed to clich6s in 42.: (1) they are marks that subsist; (2) they carry with them the force to break with their context; (3) this force of rupture is tied to the spacing that constitutes them. If the principles of the clich6 is its iterability, it may be said that this is also the principle of all</page><page sequence="21">FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 37 language, down through morphemes and phonemes to distinctive features, and up through sentences to texts. One reason for the unlikelihood of this claim'9 is that these three predicates have traditionally constituted the classical concept of writing, as opposed, most often, to the living voice which is supposed to be ephemeral, unique and continuous. A position may nevertheless be formulated according to which not just alphabetically written texts, but any kind of dis- course in any medium would still be what it is in the absence of its original or any producer as well as of any actual addressee or reader, and that it is this possibility which makes it into discourse. This would be a speakerless position with a vengeance. It was developed in great detail and many variations during the late sixties and early seventies in a series of texts signed "Jacques Derrida." Most of this paragraph is being lifted directly (de re) from one of these texts (1977 [1972]:181-183). 47. It is this classical concept of writing that helps bring the metaphysical cat out of the speakerless bag, since it is precisely the one which inspires Banfield (for instance) in the attempt to exclude certain linguistic forms, including FID, from "the communicative model of language." What the various literary forms in which she found no trace of FID have in common besides that fact is "the communicative form they all share." Her text continues: Speech entails communication, but communication does not entail speech. Com- munication may be written, but need not be; oral discourse, imitations of it, and letters cannot free themselves from the I-you relation. (For this reason, the specific indications of speech - indications of pronunciation - are also indications of communication. Conversely, a sentence of noncommunication cannot be appropriately created in speech. Noncommunication is perforce a literary form, for it is writing which actualizes the divorce in performance between SPEAKER and SELF, between PRESENT and NOW, which is a potential of linguistic competence. This potential divorce, represented at the level of linguistic theory as part of the speaker's implicit knowledge, cannot be realized morphologically and syntactically until language is freed from the speech act, until what may begin as the transcription of speech becomes a kind of linguistic performance which bypasses the actual phonetic realization of language as speech (1978b:445). This does not call for counter-examples but for a few sentences of oncommuni- cation cut off from any empirical SELF or NOW and set adrift. This divorce has always already taken place. The freedom from the tyranny of the speech act - if what is meant by this is the radical non-presence of the subject to itself, even in the silent soliloquy of the mind - has been imposed on us at least since the Fall into language. Not just the writing-act of noncommuni- cation, but also the written text itself, is present to the mind only by metonymy. Noncommunication is equally possible with or without first-person SPEAKERs. SELFs and even inner selves may and do consist entirely in nonembeddable "'Another reason is that this makes the clich6 more typical than other linguistic types. This seems to detract something from the neatness of the type/token opposition.</page><page sequence="22">38 MOSHE RON elements quoted from anonymous sources. Speech does not entail communica- tion any more than communication entails speech (I have even read - it is written - somewhere that this is supposed to be the predicament of our time). Banfield and Kuroda simply do not go far enough. They wish to exclude some of language from the communicational model, but do not give enough credit to the ability of this model to recuperate all linguistic forms (for instance, though procedures such as Grice's implicature). On the other hand, they do not seem to consider the possibility that the elimination of the communication model may weaken the status of the self-present autonomous subject in general. The freedom from communication may be followed, on quite similar grounds, by the liberation from "the inner subjective personality" (Banfield, 1978b:449) and a host of other dearly-prized humanistic notions. Once the signifier cuts loose from the signified there might be no more "consciousness," either in or outside a text, for FID to be the alleged stream of. There is a sense in which sentences and even utterances are contextless and hence speakerless. But in this sense all utterances are contextless - although some more so - or none are. 48. A friend of mine, who is a theater director, has recently produced a stage version of Beckett's novel Mercier and Camier. During rehearsals, she asked the actor playing either "Mercier" or "Camier" to change his position on the stage so as not to obstruct the audience's view of the narrator (played by a third actor). "I don't see him," was the man's reply (or words to that effect). "For me he doesn't exist." This was said of a narrator who opens his narrative thus: "The journey of Mercier and Camier is one I can tell, if I will, for I was with them all the time." It all seems to be a question of whether you can bear to be a text - a heterogeneous set of characters - or wish to be in a text - a single I, single SELF. 49.
