Every cross-cultural act breaks new ground, forging a new connection, a new hybridity, a new aesthetics, and it would be presumptuous to define cross-cultural aesthetics in fixed terms. My perfor- mance of the Tale ofHungbo, a cross-cultural p'ansori narrating the travails and tri- umphs of the Korean- American journey, sums up the key issues linking hybridity and cross-cultural aesthetics. 1. Introduction Is musical aesthetics a universal essentiality or a cultural particularity; or further, a cross-cultural hybridity? Defining essence as a dialectical process of historical com- position and decay, Lavie and Swedenburg (1996:1 1) assert that such notions as tra- dition and folklore are authenticity's preferred modes aimed at concealing hybridity; but hybridity is equally "authentic." Various manifestations of hybridization (as of- ten perceived, at least) point to the fact that culture is a conglomeration of ideas, atti- tudes, beliefs, and concrete expression in private or everyday life. Further, the styles of dominant cultures often shape the aesthetics of a hybridized form. The discussion of cross-cultural aesthetics, for that matter, is instantly embedded in the discussion of geopolitical strategies of cultural hybridization. If we assume that human history is a "process of relentless disintegration" (Lavie and Swedenburg 1996:11, quoting</page><page sequence="2">92 • the world of music 45(3) - 2003 Walter Benjamin 1997:85-88)), then the system of aesthetics as largely a historical manifestation should shift as powers shift and mutate between lands, peoples, and times. All forms of contemporary music in the world have intercultural roots, and the traffic of influence can be metaphorically referred to as the flow of water from high to low position, from center to margin, and vice versa. In a study of Chinese influ- ence in Korean music, Byung-ki Hwang argues that the weaker countries did not simply absorb but developed it further to renew their own national culture (Byung-ki Hwang 2002). The application of the imagery of water flow itself, in this context, re- inforces the idea that "a territorial lesser is assumed a cultural lesser, an inferior ves- sel fed by a superior Other" (Park 2002). Cultural influence is often historicized on the basis of geopolitical hierarchy that "alters not only the present and the future but also the memories of the past" (ibid.). Tracing the intercultural musical transactions between neighboring and remote cultures reveal that the scope for crossings and crossroads is limitless. The seemingly "pure" idiom of Western Art music and the so- called traditional musics of the various cultures of the world are, more often than not, mixtures of elements from diverse sources (Euba 1989: 1 15). As the geo-cultural lim- its are pushed further, composers, performers, and educators question the efficacy of their accomplishments "with respect to the ideological and political, ethical and mor- al, technological and technical in fostering individual and collaborative efforts" (Eu- ba and Kimberlin 1 999: 1-12). Two forces are at work in the dialectics of intercultural aesthetics: the search for the musical poetics, and the existing geopolitics that control, appropriate, and define the aesthetic legitimacy. "A new hierarchy of cultural practices seems to be in the making, in which the hybrid replaces the old category of the exotic, and the Other, now hybrid, is once again reinscribed by the Eurocenter" (Lavie and Swedenburg 1996:8). Heralded by the increasing visibility of non-Western virtuosos of Western art music, musical interculturalism has been catalyzed by the increase in the interest in non-Western musical cultures and the number and output of Western composers who are employing non-Western resources (Euba and Kimberlin 1999:12). In em- ploying their own non-Western resources, "minorities and national liberation move- ments often appropriate ethnographic essentialism as a strategy to authenticate their own experience, as a form of reactive resistance to the Eurocenter (Spivak 1996:245, quoted in Lavie and Swedenburg 1996:12). Responding to the Eurocentrism dictat- ing the culture of musical interculture, Shulamit Ran observes that a major goal of ethnomusicology is to turn "world music" into something other than a euphemism for "other people's music" (Ran 1997: 1 1-13). I respond with a Korean cross-cultural music perspective, using a case study of the tradition of p'ansori ("story-singing") across time and geography. In contrast to the colorful representation of her affluent neighbors (i.e., China and Japan), Korea's significant roles in the convergence (and divergence) of Northeast and East Asian musical cultures have been either minimized or ignored. In the recent ethnomusicological literature, however, Korea's distinct vocal, instrumental, ritual,</page><page sequence="3">Chan E. Park. Poetics and Politics of Korean Oral Tradition • 93 and performance traditions- forged through her dynamic and tumultuous history- have been increasingly favored for their rich symbolic and expressive import. Ever since Western art music was introduced through the establishment of a military band shortly after the Reformist Revolution of 1884, and through the spread of hymns her- alding Christian missionary work (Lee 1991), Korea adopted as her main intercultur- al partner Western music, ranging from classical to gospel, folk, pop, ballad, Jazz, rock, blues, rap, and more. Disciplined in Western-style music, nationally and inter- nationally celebrated composers, compositions, performers, recitals, festivals, and artistic and scholarly exchanges have since defined the mainstream Korean music scene. Referred to as umak (music proper), the Western-style music swiftly took the center stage, marginalizing the native music as kugak (national music), to be equated with "old," "anti-modern," or "low-class." The long-rooted Sino-centered Confucian disdain for native invention had in less than a century mutated into an all-pervasive West-centeredness. 2. Poetics and Politics of Identity From the 1960s, the Korean government began implementing the policy of preserva- tion of native performances as "intangible culture treasures." Partaking in the global anthropological, folkloric, and commercial interests in resurrecting the remaining past, modern Koreans began their search for their own folk traditions like tourists in their own land. Between the need to address the shifting aesthetics and maintain cre- ativity, contemporary Korean composers schooled in Western art music looked to- ward relics of indigenous music. Four Korean- American composers in the recent symposium, Composing Identity: Korean Sentiment and Sounds in an American Context,1 discussed their efforts to balance personal creativity and the collective cul- tural and ethnic identity, focusing on "the compositional techniques to reference a Korean sound, and of the effect of the American context on compositional perspec- tives and practices."2 The following questions were proposed during the symposium: "Is Korean music alive or dead in South Korea? What is its role on its native soil? Will Westerners hear and understand such "Koreanness" in these compositions?" (Finchum-Sung 2003). In consideration of Korea's sociocultural shift toward the West in the twentieth cen- tury, these composers were expectedly "native" to Western-style music and acquired kugak like a second language. Belatedly acquainted with the musical grammar of their ethnicity long shunned by the elitist mainstream, they were to "liberate" (Serra Hwang 2003; Ahn 2003) their compositional consciousnesses from the confines of Western and Western avant-garde scenes to create a "groove"-based music" (Serra Hwang 2003), and to simultaneously liberate kugak to be "flexible and changing."3 The utilization of kugak in modern composition poses the danger of political incor- rectness, of accusation of "playing [one's] ethnic trump card" (Serra Hwang 2003), or "promoting exoticism or otherness to secure grants or performance" (Na 2003).</page><page sequence="4">94 • the world of music 45( 3) - 2003 Complexity and contradiction belie the attitudes and motivations of the composers themselves. A composer launches the dual goal of writing "a fresh music for foreign- ers" while " returning to roots" by honoring past traditions and the homeland (Serra Hwang 2003). Roger Abrahams' observation of the modern's nostalgic attitude to- ward the past- as a lost birthright with little understanding of what that legacy would have been- taints the composer's otherwise good will and nostalgia for unfettered tradition and homeland community. This depiction of the past draws on the "victimage" model of explanation.... Worse still, using the imagined community of such a prelapsarian world as a basis for consti- tuting contemporary lifeways is to risk essentializing, vulgarizing, and virulently ste- reotyping the people we have decided have maintained some of these communitarian lifeways (Abrahams 1994:78-93). Essentialism may serve to appropriate "the concept of fixity of form and content from the Eurocenter for the margin's recovery and healing" (Lavie and Swendenburg 1996: 12), but is of little help for composers trying to be dissociated from exoticism, despite diplomatic references to Koreanness. "If too subtle, audiences won't catch them; if too obvious, sounds too crude"(Ahn 2003). The question, "at some point does Korean- American become neither Korean or American? Perhaps a new middle or higher ground?"4 reflects the complex challenge of musical cross-cultural aesthet- ics in the making. At the end of the rigorous search, could identity -aesthetic, ethnic, cultural, national- at last be expressed, without "shouting," in music? 3. Insiders and Outsiders: The Two-way Traffic Curiously absent in the processes and discussions of musical cross-culture are the voices from inside the musical traditions, though many of the borrowings bear "deeply ingrained connotations which the composer ignores at his peril" (Ryker 1991 : 16). Collaboration seems inevitable, as the insiders have intimate knowledge of the music, traditions and customs under study, but lacks objectivity, and outsiders of- fer objectivity but lack the inside knowledge (Euba and Kimberlin 1998:6). Two dif- ferent systems of music making have yet to be harmonized: "composition" as we know it with the use of notation by individual composers, and "tradition" mnemoni- cally transmitted from generation to generation and from singer to singer. "Sheet mu- sic" credited to an individual "composer" is largely an alien concept in traditional music, where "the musical writer worked, for the most part, anonymously" (Ryker 1991:12) and repertoires were collectively crafted and mnemonically inherited. In oral tradition where "thought itself relates in an altogether special way to sound" (Ong 1982:5-7), based on the study of the Yugoslavian singers of Homeric epic, some assert that epic singers compose as they sing, using a "formula," "a group of words which is regularly employed under the same metrical conditions to express a given essential idea" (Parry 1954, quoted in Park 2003:19). When applied to tradi- tional Korean music, a formula is a communal inheritance (be it a word, phrase, sen-</page><page sequence="5">Chan E . Park. Poetics and Politics of Korean Oral Tradition • 95 tence, entire song), a basic grammar for individual performance. In performance the individuating factor is the "voice"- be it human, instrumental, or somatic- that "shape[s] differently, even when cultivated under the same teacher," based on the performer's "vocal, hermeneutic, and semiotic inclinations" (Park 2003:164). A relic of oral culture today guarded as a national treasure, py ansori- a story- singing art that emerged from the repertoire of the outcast kwangdae singers during the mid-Chosõn era to evolve into Korea's Intangible Cultural Asset No. 5 in the twentieth century -is an intriguing matrix of societal and aesthetic crossings, contra- dictions, engagements, disengagements, tale, and telling. Cultural preservationists tend to view the art as an immutable and fixed archetype, but p ' ansori is a chronicle of Koreans' journey from past to present, and of the singers' strategies of negotiating tradition and adaptation, oral culture and literary intervention, between the epic past and the present- the nature of performance. As attested by the modern ethnogra- phers of speaking (Bakhtin 1981; Young 1987), storytelling is an intersection of at least two narrative worlds: the tale and the telling (or the narrated world of characters situated in the past and the narrator's and audience's world here and now). Unlike written narrative where the reader is implied, the presence of the audience is explicit and immediate in oral narrative, prompting direct engagement in performance. In p ' ansori , the act of telling encounters another layer of complex negotiation in sor i : a musical and vocal narrative structured and largely sealed in the past, and the acquisition of fluency in this is a prerequisite to the act of telling. The singers through the changing eras have navigated and adjusted the epic constitutions of sori and the shifting p'an (the narrative event), forging an epic reality between tradition and the present. Drawing on the resources of p' ansori 's roots in shamanistic rituals, the sing- ers skillfully re-textualized as entertainment their sacred musical and narrative for- mulae while incorporating the other regional musical and narrative traditions. P' an- sori crossed geographies, the sacred and the secular. In the nineteenth century, the story-singing act was adjusted as a favored form of entertainment among royal and aristocratic patrons and audiences while retaining its folk popularity. In their subser- vient status as kwangdae , the singers sought out literati penmanship, and even suc- cumbed silently to the most unrealistic prosodie demands to render singable what was unsingable. This practice gave rise to a genius vocalism, which draws on the lin- guistic hybridity between Sino-Korean bookishness and the stark orality of provin- cial common people, the language of their patrons and their own, contradictory yet oddly harmonious when sung, keyed to simultaneously entertain their social superi- ors and their own kind. The scholarly literature customarily credits the scholar/bureaucrat Shin Chaehyo (1812-84) for its linguistic gentrification. The world of performance in contrast finds the singers' voice as the primary inspiration, suggesting that the voice of p' ansori gained access to a wider audience by translating into coherent poetics the stratified and polarized worldviews of the time. The hierarchy of written scholarship over oral tradition tends to underrepresent and overshadow the role of singers in the process of canonization, particularly their</page><page sequence="6">96 • the world of music 45(3) - 2003 resolution of the linguistic and aesthetic incongruities imposed on them by their so- cial superiors. The singers focused on making acoustic sense of the revised text and lending verisimilitude to the situations and feelings of the characters within the story. Their genuine efforts to reconstruct the characters and situations are doubtless a fac- tor in the formation of p'ansori as a voice capable of portraying people of all moral, ethical, social, and political proportions. At the threshold of the twentieth century, p'ansori served as the primary inspiration in the modernization of Korean drama, re- sulting in the birth of ch'angguk , "singing theater." Then sori was discarded from center stage, giving way to imported music and drama. For much of the twentieth century, sori catered to the Korean modernity-driven ego as a "vulgar" reminder of its "backward" past. Once again the winds of politics reversed, and in the 1960s p 'ansori was taken up as a "national treasure," to help define the Korean postcolonial and global identity and rendering inspiration to various cross-cultural possibilities. In the serendipitous beginning of p'ansori, its emergent creativity dominated and propelled its development. In the twentieth century, however, p ' ansori rapidly be- came a ceremony, an epic past first reviled and then revered. Not only its narrated world of Ch'unhyang and Sim Ch'ông, protagonists of two most representative nar- ratives, but the narrative event itself was identified with a finished and sealed past, "to be valorized and deprived of any relativity" (Bakhtin 1981, quoted in Park 2003:15), "dead as dinosaur" (Scholes and Kellogg 1961, quoted in Park 2003:15), and designated as "national treasure." Listed in the national inventory of intangible cultural archetypes, the treasure is to be preserved both from extinction and evolu- tion, its narrative productivity suppressed and the traces of its creative engagement obscured. The fact that the musical, linguistic, and narrative environment from which p'ansori had emerged and developed had long disappeared helps legitimize the novelty it enjoys. Its archetypal existence together with its "five-narrative canon" has been reverentially upheld by singers of the twentieth century as well. By faithful- ly engraving breath for breath, word for word on their vocal cords the voices of their predecessors, they hoped to gain entrance to the twentieth-century Hall of Fame as "human national treasures," a reverse anthropomorphism in the well-intended spirit of "preservation." That p'ansori at the brink of extinction has dramatically survived as the "Intangi- ble Cultural Asset Number 5" could be considered as yet another stunt engaging the Korean cultural politics of today, where the private reproductive cycle of p'ansori is suppressed by its public mission as a national tradition. P'ansori is still a voice con- juring for modern Koreans a myriad of emotions, feelings, and collective memories. It admittedly thrives much less on improvisation or new composition than on collec- tive tradition and confirmation of its past. Still, its performance is far from synthetic or superficial, as it is not a surgical reconstruction of the past but a continuing past (see further Park 2003: 15).</page><page sequence="7">Chan E. Park. Poetics and Politics of Korean Oral Tradition • 97 4. Making a Cross-cultural P' ansori. Clear and imminent signs of "reproduction" are found beyond the p' ansori canon. Jolted from epic complacency in times of national peril, p ' ansori has been imple- mented in the expression of strong sentiments against perceived social and political injustices. Following the Independence from Japan, a new p' ansori called "Songs of Patriots" emerged, eulogies for five national heroes, four of whom were martyred in their fight for Korean Independence from Japan. The narratives are modeled after the "five-narrative canon," and despite substantial popular visibility, the "Songs" have yet to gain epic status in the preservationist perspective. The protagonists fighting for independence from Japanese colonial occupation (1910-45) and their martyrdoms, with the exception of Admiral Yi Sunshin killed while defending the nation from the Hideyoshi invasion (1592-97), are too fresh a memory to be sealed in the distant past. Further outside the canon, a few rhapsodic poems by Kim Chiha and eulogies about the Kwangju Massacre (1980) were also sung in the style oí p' ansori. Unfolding au- diovisually on screen, the narrative world of the p' ansori Ch'unhyang, the recent film Ch'unhyang earned international acclaim. Still further away from the epicenter of p' ansori, I began an epic about the hundred-year Korean immigration to America, performed at the Centennial Celebration of the Korean Immigration to America, Ho- nolulu, 13 January 2003. In the era of human cloning, unbridled technological advancement, so-called Weapons of Mass Destruction and the "surgical removal" of one government by an- other, how do you represent narratives of faith, resistance, and healing revolving around such "premodern" concepts as loyalty, chastity, filial piety, or sibling order across time, place, and language barriers? How do you make accessible to the unfa- miliar ear the antiquated vocal aesthetics of p' ansori! Coupled with these inherent challenges, I was imparted with the Centennial Committee's wishful vision of a kind of "rock" p 'ansori extravaganza with dance, drama, and music, packaged in less than twenty minutes, an alchemy as yet unheard of! I also faced the prevailing impression that "p' ansori is long and boring": without understanding the language, an oral nar- rative performance can undoubtedly seem long and less-than-titillating. The voice of storytelling counseled me to simply tell the story of Korean immigration to America, not as a historian but as a poet, to parallel the migration of the Korean narrative and lyrical heritages. Between the business of informing and of the aesthetics of inform- ing, a cross-lingual artist negotiates between gains and losses: between the necessity of widening informational channels and the eventually 'contaminating' the aesthet- ics inherent in the original language (see further Park 2003). Narrating the travails and triumphs of the Korean-American journey is Hungbo, protagonist of the Tale of Hungbo. Abandoned by his older brother, Hungbo joins the first group of Koreans recruited for labor at the sugar plantation in Hawai'i. There, he marries a picture bride. One after another they beget children. A pair of kolea birds (transformed in this rendition from the original pair of swallows) moves in and hatch two chicks. One flies away, and the other falls and breaks her leg. Hungbo and his good wife take care</page><page sequence="8">98 • the world of music 45(3) - 2003 of her, and she heals. The next spring, Hungbo's kolea brings a gourd seed from the Kolea Kingdom in the South Pacific; Hungbo plants it, and it grows and grows, and yields three beautiful gourds. On Makahiki season, they harvest the gourds for use as an offering, and out pour money, rice, treasures, computers, DVDs, surfboards, and more. They become the wealthiest people in Hawaii, and their children and grand- children serve their communities well. The performance alternated between story- telling in English and storysinging in Korean with English subtitles. Accompanying the twentieth-century Korean transnational journey- through colonization, displacement, departure, relocation, labor, leisure, harvest, pain, plea- sure, sorrow, and the multi-generation making of community in their home away from home- were familiar folk and labor tunes: Arirang for the displacement and departure; Paennorae (Boat Song), for the voyage across the Pacific; Pang' a ťary- ong (Milling Song), for the first harvest; Sarangga (Love Song), from Song of Ch'unhyang for Hungbo's honeymoon with his picture bride; Pakť aryong (Gourd Sawing Song), and the Gourd Opening Song from Song of Hungbo. Minyo , "folk" or "people's" songs, evokes the collective emotions and communality without requir- ing a particularly sophisticated singing technique. Chanting in unison or antiphonally, humans in labor felt connected and energized.... For the amalgamated and the spirited, labor ceased to be a reason for lamentation but an occasion for celebration of productivity and life, sublimated into a dynamic com- munal and cultural event. The tunes invariably reflect an ironic coexistence of joy and sorrow, sometimes conveying joyful sorrow and other times sorrowful joy" (Park 2003). Hawai'i embraces the Korean immigrants with her chants, dances, and aloha. Tradition teaches us respect for the aina , the land, due upon entering any new land. In 1903, Pak Hungbo Went to Hawai'i incorporated Hawaiian chant for context and for ambience, provided by Keola Ka'uhane: at the arrival of the S.S.Gaelic in Honolulu Harbor, during the kolea bird's journey to the South Pacific and back, and at the saw- ing of the magic gourds: Sung: Sirirõng silgün , let's saw it! Eyõru , pull it! Spoken: Keikis ! Come out and help us saw the gourds ! Invite Mr. Ka'uhane to come and bless the gourds. He has a great voice! (Escorted by the children carrying ippus , a Hawaiian chanter enters.) "Mr. Ka'uhane, good to see you! Can you bless these gourds?" Chanter: "At the already prepared planting spot, the farmer drops the seed with a sudden outward motion of his hands with his palm up. If the palms are down, the gourds will grow crooked and shriveled. While dropping the seeds, the farmer says a prayer-suggestion." "Then let's do a Korean-Hawaiian gourd-sawing chant!"</page><page sequence="9">Chan E. Park. Poetics and Politics of Korean Oral Tradition • 99 Sung: Sirirong silgün , let's saw it! Eyõru , pull it! Chanter: He ipu nuil (A huge ipu!) 0 hiki ku mauna (Growing like a mountain) Sung: When this gourd opens, 1 want nothing but a pot of rice. A big pot of rice is my lifelong wish. Chanter: He ipu nuil (A huge ipu!) O hiki kua (To be carried on the back) Sung: Eh-yoru , pull it! Chanter: He ipu nuil (A huge ipu!) Nui Maoli keia ipu! (Really huge is this gourd!)5 Sung: Sirirong sirirong sirirong sirirong, ttukttak! Spoken: The first gourd opens, it's empty.6 The play closes with the uplifting performance of ancient hula chant and dance. The gathering of props for materializing the drama of the Korean-American cen- tennial journey was itself a cross-cultural journey. I brought from my home in Co- lumbus, Ohio a wayfarer's knapsack with a small gourd dipper dangling from it, a long white apron, a waist tie, a white bandana, and a puch'ae (folding fan, a conven- tional p'ansori prop). In Hawai'i, I secured two pairs of straw sandals to hang from the wayfarer's knapsack, three larger gourds, a rope for the enactment of gourd saw- ing, three flags- Korean, American, and Hawaiian- and two fresh leis, one plumer- ía and one pikake, for the arrival of the first Koreans, a flower bouquet for the picture bride, two sugarcane sticks with leaves intact, and a pair of garden gloves for the milling scene. Gathering these items was for me a supplication to the spirits of story- telling, singing, playacting, Muses, and Dionysus to bless this unprecedented perfor- mance of p'ansori, not unlike a shaman's preparing her sacred props before the ritu- al. A weeklong search for the sugarcane sticks was the climax of my pilgrimage, beginning at the old plantation mill in Kahuku to the North Shore, to Waialua, back to Manoa Open Market, and ending in Chinatown, Downtown Honolulu. Complete with my own reading glasses and a cup of water to be incorporated as well, and dis- played on a table in the order of use, these props were essential to portraying the changing locales, peoples, activities, and fortunes. Providing the musical accompaniment were two of Korea's most accomplished artists from the tradition of p'ansori and sanjo respectively: Chung Hoisuk provided seasoned drum accompaniment, and Chung Soonyun on haegum (two-stringed fid- dle) embellished the production with a sanjo (highly improvisational instrumental music) prelude and sound effects and accompaniment throughout. During the first rehearsal, all my toils and troubles were instantly compensated for by the sheer joy of</page><page sequence="10">100 • the world of music 45(3) - 2003 this communion of inside knowledge and understanding of the tradition and its cross- cultural presentation. 5. Creating Cross-cultural Aesthetics Striving for cross-cultural aesthetics is one thing, but measuring it is another. Every cross-cultural act breaks new ground, forging a new connection, a new hybridity, a new aesthetics, and it would be presumptuous to define cross-cultural aesthetics in fixed terms. There is already a significant historical precedence for cross-cultural works by composers trained in Western-style music; thus the corresponding body of criticism should be similarly well established. Where this precedence is less defined, as in the case of cross-cultural p'ansori , an audience's reaction to a specific perfor- mance-their likes and dislikes, tears and laughs, approvals and disapprovals and uncertainties- must certainly be reckoned among the researcher's critical body of evidence. In performance, creation of cross-cultural aesthetics involves two parties: the performer and the audience. At the same time, a cross-cultural stage requires sen- sitivity toward the audience's cultural backgrounds and inclinations. A performance enthusiastically received in one locale might elicit only confusion or indifference at best in another. How did the audience regard In 1903 , Pak Hungbo Went to Hawai' i? As fusion art, as "culture salad," as a "successful" hybridization, or simply as a p'ansori (the author's hoped-for association)? In addition to the mirth they demonstrated through- out the performance, what impression did they come away with? Many kindly show- ered upon it such uplifting compliments as "I did not know Korean humor could be localized so well," or "I had no idea p'ansori could be so much fun," or "better than Hollywood!" The comment by Pahk KyungAe, a San Francisco resident and Kore- an-American rap music promoter was more poised: "At your first utterance of p'an- sori, tears welled up in my eyes. I said, 'she's got it! ' It is different from just grabbing at different sounds." Returning to Korea, Professor Pak Chongch'ol of Choson Uni- versity wrote in the Regional Newspaper Column: "The English p'ansori was not a welcome program during the planning stages, but made the highlight of the Centen- nial celebration. . .a new masterpiece of international magnitude. . .a landmark for the globalization of Korean culture" (19 February 2003). That the audience of In 1903 was ready to absorb all the cross-cultural humor and pathos presented is unsurprising given the Hawaiian demographic; the state is arguably the closest approximation of the American ethnic "melting pot" ideal. Comments on the diversity of food (for ex- ample, steaming saimin and Portuguese sausage and rice offered as breakfast at Ha- waiian McDonalds, the Koreans' introduction of kim-chee into the local diet) were welcomed and appreciated by people less accustomed to constructing the exoticist barrier around the unfamiliar. In closing, tradition in our cultural spheres has many faces, and recycling tradi- tion in musical performance is similarly a mingling of diverse passages, styles, and</page><page sequence="11">Chan E.

If contemporary composers look to traditional Korean music for composi- tional inspiration, my own effort at creating a p 'ansori for a shifted context could be seen as a reverse journey, of looking to the modern and contemporary venues and contexts to regenerate a traditional voice. My modest cross-cultural p' ansori will continue with all of its newly defined hybrid aesthetics into the history of modern Korea and Korean America, where global geopolitics and aesthetics intersect.
