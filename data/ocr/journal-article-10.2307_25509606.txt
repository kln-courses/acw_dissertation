<plain_text><page sequence="1">59 THE SCULPTURE OF THE CLOISTER OF JERPOINT ABBEY Edwin C. Rae The Cistercian foundation of Jerpoint is one of the most interesting, beautiful, and distinctive monastic establishments which remains from the medieval period in Ireland.1 The fine church, with its subtly tapered tower, presents a picture of modest dignity. And because of the many sculptured figures which adorn it, the cloister is unique. The abbey is situated close to the Little Arrigle River, not far from its juncture with the Nore, about one and one-half miles south-west of Thomastown, County Kilkenny. The modern name seems clearly to be derived from the customary reference to the abbey in Latin documents as de Jeriponte. The first part of the word, Jeri, may in turn be a Latin approximation of the Irish Eoir (English, Nore).2 On the other hand, the place has also been referred to as Seiripun (or Seriopun, a phonetic rendering in Irish of the Latin version of the name), and in at least one twelfth-century document the actual site of the foundation is given as Ballyochellam.3 The exact date of the initial founding of the abbey as an organized group of monks has been lost (it may have come into being in the first instance as a Benedictine house);4 sometime between 1151 and 1165 appears probable.5 Domh nall Ua Domchadha (Donald O Donoghoe), who succeeded his father as King of 1 This article is intended to be a contribution to the recording and study of Irish Gothic sculpture. Compared to what has been done on work created prior to 1170, the pub lication of the later material has just begun. The need for a study of Jerpoint was first suggested to me by Dr. Francoise Henry. I wish also to acknowledge with gratitude the help afforded me by the advice and published works of John Hunt, Catriona Mac Leod, Helen Roe, and especially the late Dr. Harold G. Leask, my chief mentor in Irish matters. 2 Reverend William Canon Carrigan, The History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory, Dublin, 1905, IV, p. 284, gives several variations of the name but does not believe that "Jerpoint" derives from the Irish in any way. 3 William Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum, new ed., John Caley et al? editors, London, James Bonn, 1864, VI, Part 2, p. 1131. 4 A. Hamilton Thompson, A. W. Clapham, and H. G. Leask, "The Cistercian Order in Ireland," Archaeological Journal, LXXXVIII, 1931, pp. 6-7. 5 Carrigan, op. cit., IV, pp. 278 ff., takes the date 1151, the latest time when Baltinglass, the mother house of lerpoint, could have been founded, and 1165, the latest possible date when a document which refers specifically to the "convent of Ossory" (usually identified as lerpoint) could have been made, and divides the difference equally, thus arriving at 1158 as the time of the foundation, a date which appears in print with in creasing frequency without any indication of its hypothetical nature. The reference in Dugdale given in note 3 (above) comes from a charter of Prince John, an exemplification and confirmation of which was granted to the abbot in the 34th year of the reign of Edward III. It confirms to Jerpoint lands, etc., "quas Hibernienses eis fecerunt ration alibiliter ante primum adventum eomitis Ricardi [Strongbow] in Hiberniam; et nomin</page><page sequence="2">60 E. C.

Hence, the first construction at Jerpoint is in all likelihood not earlier than 1165, and is probably as much as a decade later. The original windows of the church were round-topped, those in the eastern (earlier) parts showing in some instances the inclined jambs of ancient Irish work. Originally the arches leading into the crossing space were probably also round topped; those of the chapels and nave arcade are bluntly pointed, as is often true of twelfth-century Cistercian churches. Typically Irish Romanesque details in the presbytery, transepts, and eastern part of the nave, together with alternating round and square piers, point to undeniable influence from the contemporary or perhaps slightly earlier church of Baltinglass Abbey on the western edge of County Wicklow.6 The rest of the nave, and especially the splendidly constructed win dows in the west wall, are equally Romanesque, but less distinctively Irish. Only the fact that some of the arches were slightly pointed really justifies considering the church to be early Transitional in style. Thirteenth-century architectural work at Jerpoint consists largely of the claustral ranges, where little carved detail remains. And only the Decorated window inserted in the east wall of the presbytery (chancel) seems indubitably to date from some time within the hundred years which followed. The tower and cloister are usually considered to date from the fifteenth century. Three cogent considerations support this opinion: the fact that such features were frequently added or remade at this time and in the early sixteenth century; a reference to them in the papal registers of the year 14427; and the style of the mouldings and sculptured detail. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CLOISTER The cloister garth at Jerpoint Abbey (fig. 1) measures about ninety-eight feet from east to west, ninety-five from north to south.8 By the end of the Middle atim rationabilem donationem quam Dumvaldus rex Ossoriae eis fecit de terris sub scriptis: terram viz.

" Unless we have here Donald's confirmation of a pre vious grant, it was he who made possible the beginnings of lerpoint as an actual group of buildings, and he was thus the founder in the sense of the greatest benefactor. The monastery was reinforced by monks from Baltinglass in 1180 (Thompson et al, op. cit., p. 14), this "reinforcement", or perhaps reestablishment, being of such a nature that Baltinglass was considered the mother monastery. 6 The plan of the church at lerpoint is quite typical of the Irish Cistercians. This fact, and the similarity between the carved detail of the original east windows of the pres bytery and that of the eastern part of the nave, make it difficult for me to accept the suggestion of Harold G. Leask, Irish Churches and Monastic Buildings, Dundalk, 1958, II, p. 28, that the presbytery and parts of the transepts are the result of a different building campaign from that which produced the rest of the eastern part of the church. Certain awkwardnesses, errors, and variations in detail are to be expected in medieval construction. The situation is simpler at Baltinglass, where the east end is atypical in plan and differs in detail from the nave. 7 Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers Relating to Great Britain and Ireland, London, H.M.

RAE Ages there was apparently a cloister arcade bearing a simple lean-to roof on all four sides, the supports consisting of groups of round-topped arches carried on coupled colonnettes. Between the groups of arches were rectangular piers which projected into the garth like shallow buttresses for a distance of probably only a few inches. (This projection has not been carried out in the recent reconstruc tion of the west and south arcades). The corners of the garth were apparently marked by L-shaped piers. Joined together by a plate (that is, a web, or septum) of stone, the pairs of colonnettes formed a thin but sturdy pier (PL 2), which gave effective resistance to the thrust of the lean-to roof. This thin pier, either treated in its entirety as a slab or else carved into coupled colonnettes, was used in the great majority of late Gothic cloisters in Ireland. In continental examples of this type, from Roman esque or later times, the supports consisted usually of colonnes jumelles, i.e., freestanding, paired colonnettes, the capitals of which often coalesced more or less completely before the common abacus was reached.9 Remains of Irish cloister arcades which can be dated to some time before the fifteenth century are very rare indeed.10 It has been surmised that early arcades may often have been of wood, which was very plentiful in some areas in Ireland throughout the medieval period; as late as the early sixteenth century a friary church (Dromahaire) is recorded to have been built of this material, although it was soon burned and replaced by stone. Yet, evidence in England shows that extant Gothic cloisters often replaced Romanesque predecessors of stone, and the same sequence probably took place in Ireland. In most instances where coupled colonnettes occur in late medieval Irish cloisters, Romanesque influence is obvious in one detail or another.11 There was considerable variety in the treatment of the supports. Sometimes they were cylindrical, enriched by fillets; sometimes octagonal; here spirally grooved; there adorned with billets. None of the many extant colonnettes at Jerpoint, however, had such architectural embellishments, although here and there a miscellaneous bit of sculpture appears upon them and frequently part of the subject carved upon the plate escapes over onto the colonnette (Pis. 10a and 5, a &amp; b). Most cf the colonnettes are about three and one-half inches in diameter, the plate 9 For a large number of illustrations of examples, see Paul Mesple, Toulouse, Musee des Augustins: Les Sculptures Romanes, Paris, Musees Nationaux, 1961. 10 Among them are Mellifont (XII century; the best example, now in part reconstructed); Cong (early XIII; according to Leask, Irish Churches, II, pp. 60-61, who considers that it shows probably the first appearance in Ireland of the "dumbbell" coupling of colon nettes); Abbeyshrule (Longford) (ibid. pp. 140-144, note; probably XII century); Balting lass (XIII?); and probably Kells (Kilkenny). n Some of the most interesting work in Ireland in the fifteenth century shows this "Renaissance of the Romanesque" in motif and feeling for form. Whether for the same causes or not, the insular work therefore joins with phases of Italian architecture of the fourteenth century (and some of the architecture depicted in Flemish painting of the fifteenth) to indicate a point of view toward architectural form which can be considered a parallel phenomenon to the Renaissance which began in Italy around 1400. In this regard, note particularly furgis Baltrusaitis, Reveils et Prodigues: le gothique fantastique, Paris, Armand Colin, 1960, chapter 5: "Le reveil de la plastique romane."</page><page sequence="5">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 63 connecting them being two inches thick. In a few instances, however, the former are even more delicate, about two and three-quarter inches in diameter, the plate from one and one-half to a little over one and three-quarters inches in thickness. The supports were enriched by sculpture on the capitals, the plates, and the bases. Other representations of flora and fauna were scattered at random on the arches. Most of the arches here are composed of three pieces of stone, which run through the whole thickness of the wall (PL 2). On the side which is now toward the walk, probably in accordance with the original disposition, there is but a plain chamfer, whereas on the side toward the garth is what amounts to a filleted round in a concave chamfer. Enough pieces of stone to form two or three arches exhibit a finer, more complete moulding. The slenderer colonnettes are left in about the same proportion. It could be suggested that part of the cloister may have been built at a different, probably slightly earlier time than the remainder. The capitals are more in tune with early insular Gothic than with the Roman esque as regards their basic form. They are practically all circular in plan. The abaci, also circular, present the simple profile of a rectangular projection with a quarter-round on the lower angle, sometimes followed by a narrow fascia (PL 2). Such simply moulded abaci are most unusual in Irish Gothic work of the thirt eenth and fourteenth centuries, having disappeared with the transitional architec ture of the end of the Romanesque period. For its principal feature the capital has either a large half-round with a broad, flat fillet on its face, or else a wreath of foliage which is sometimes enlivened by human heads and animals. But the presence of a prominent moulding separating this part of the capital from the tapering bell is contrary to common early Gothic practice, and so is the fact that the bell is in the great majority of cases quite devoid of sculptural detail. The capitals are definitely derived from, but not the same as, thirteenth-century work. As to the highly distinctive bases (PL 2), they are indeed difficult to match anywhere else in the land. Only Baltinglass Abbey has to date furnished anything that is in any way clearly related. Thirteenth-century Gothic bases are practic ally always composed of rounded members, often with a fillet, alternating with simple, concave mouldings. In the fourteenth century these elements tend to become coarsened or multiplied; and work done after 1400 usually exhibits the spreading bases common to the last phase of Gothic, often with long, con tinuous profiles. At Jerpoint, however, the coupled bases with their rectangular plinths present a succession of simple arcs of circles, separated by horizontal and vertical passages. The two lower mouldings, lightly articulated, are suggestive, in Ireland, of Romanesque and Transitional work of the kind seen in the abaci of the capitals of the early doorways at Cong.12 Comparable bases found at Baiting lass appear to date from the thirteenth century, but are too clumsy and inarticu late (possibly because of the nature of the stone from which they are made) to have been the direct ancestors of those at Jerpoint. Perhaps both were inspired from common prototypes. 12 Leask, Irish Churches, II, plate VIII.</page><page sequence="6">64 E- C. RAE EXTENT AND NATURE OF THE CARVINGS13 The carved detail of the Jerpoint cloister is to be found on the thirty-eight reconstituted piers, the loose capitals cemented onto the wall along the east walk, the arches of the arcade, and a considerable number of miscellaneous pieces and broken fragments assembled in one of the rooms of the east range. At least one piece of a pair of colonnettes is in private hands. The two carved fragments which had been removed to Knocktopher at some undisclosed date14 have since been returned to Jerpoint and form part of the arcades again. The present location of the piece or pieces bearing figures of a knight and a young woman, once used as headstones in the graveyard of a church at Thomastown, is apparently unknown; and another figure, at one time seen at Thomastown and thought perhaps to represent St. Michael,15 is either one of the fragments now back at Jerpoint or else is also lost. An attempt to find the two figures of knights which Carrigan described as being at Pilltown (1905)16 proved quite fruitless. But so great was the quantity of the sculpture at Jerpoint compared to all other Irish cloisters, and so far was it scattered, that every probability suggests that there are additional pieces which will some day become available for study. At the Augustinian priory of Inistioge, less than seven miles from the Cistercian foundation, are remains of a cloister which consist for the most part of coupled colonnettes with carving on the plate. They are obviously related to the work at Jerpoint, but differ from it as to style and dimensions to such a degree that one may put aside the possibility that the Inistioge fragments ever formed part of the ensemble at the Cistercian house.17 !3 In the description of the sculpture, the re-erected cloister supports have been numbered consecutively, starting with the pier at the north-west corner of the garth and con tinuing along the west and south sides. The isolated pier in the north-east corner is designated by the number thirty-eight. Fragmentary capitals fixed to the low wall which marks the site of the foundations for the east walk are numbered consecutively, starting from the north end. The term "capital" as used in this discussion should always be taken as referring to a joined pair unless the contrary is indicated. 14 Illustrated in the /. Assoc. Pres. Mem. Dead /, IX 1913, no. 1, p. 103. 15 Rev. lames Graves, JSRAI, II, 1868, pp. 52-54, I. G. A. Prim thought he had seen the St. Michael, although it is believed to have disappeared from Thomastown before 1868. 6 Carrigan, op. cit., IV, p. 200. Apparently the figures were on opposite sides of a slab of stone, described as "exactly similar to those slabs at lerpoint and Inistioge. On each face is a well-carved effigy of a warrior in a complete armour.. ." Carrigan recognized the "ordinary Walsh coat of arms, viz., a chevron between three pheons" on one shield; the other being charged with "ermine, a chevron". 17 Carrigan, op. cit., IV, p. 107, refers to a catalogue of the bishops of Ossory apparently drawn up a few years after 1550, the date of the death of the last prior of Inistioge, Myles Baron (1528-1550), who had been appointed Bishop of Ossory in 1528, but was given a papal dispensation to retain both his position and revenues as prior of Inistioge. Special mention was made of the new bell tower and cloister that Bishop Baron had added to the priory. There seems to be no validity in the opinion of Richard Langrishe, "The Priory of Inistioge", J.R.S.A.I., XXVI, 1896, p. 372, that "the sculptured stones belonging to the cloister which remain, are of a much earlier type" than what might have been done in the first half of the sixteenth century. The carving is actually similar to that of many of the tombs still extant in Co. Kilkenny which date from this time. The fragments of the cloister at Inistioge which I have been able to examine measure eleven and three-quarters inches in total width across the "dumbbell" pier (colonnettes and connecting plate). In this measurement the piers at Inistioge are about the same as many at Jerpoint. However, some of the colonnettes at the Augustinian foundation</page><page sequence="7">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 65 Seldom is the joy of creation more whimsical and unfettered than in some of the capitals. Thirty, however, are simply moulded, and two more pairs are similarly treated for half of their periphery (PL 2). Ten and one-half others have simple mouldings as their basic form, but also have additional details such as human heads, animals, flowers, nail-head decorations, cord twist, and the like. Twelve, plus a half of each of two other pairs, are wreathed solely in foliage; another six and one-half have foliage combined with other objects. Four of the pairs of capitals have carvings of some kind on the bell. As to the bases, nine are quite plain, save for the mouldings common to all the bases of the cloister. Sixteen have additional embellishment, such as griffes at the corners and a variety of motifs on the centre of the long side (Pis. 2, 11, 12). Representational motifs were preferred to purely geometrical forms in these labours of love: there appear to be but five griffes which are plain tetrahedrons. Fourteen are recognizable as foliate in type, and thirteen or four teen depict human or animal subjects. Foliate or geometrical decoration occurs on the middle of the base in ten cases, animal or human in fifteen others. In a few instances little enframements, four of them ellipses, are placed around these figures. Variety is the keynote. On the north side of the base of pier number five (PL 10c) a dragon forms an enframement for a head. An interesting transition from the use of such an enclosure to its omission is revealed on the base of pier twelve. On the north side, the stem of a much conventionalized foliate trefoil is brought around to form a frame (PL 5c); there is no enclosure of any kind around the similar foliate motif on the south side. The enframements strongly suggest derivation from manuscripts. We are reminded of those myriads of creatures, sometimes entangled, but in other instances comfortably ensconced in apertures formed by the spreading stems and tendrils of the illuminated page. Capital letters of rounded form also provide an appropriate habitat for single figures or scenes in manuscripts. Supporting elements on each side of the principal subject carved on English misericordes are sometimes encircled by stems, but these seem less probable as sources for the Jerpoint frames. Ten of the arches carry carved details in addition to their mouldings, and these grace notes range from a single sycamore or ivy leaf to a wreathed face (PL 10 d). They appear to have been added as the impulse occurred, and may be found on the side of the arch toward the garth, on the soffit, or on the chamfer toward the walk. Most immediately arresting of all the sculptures of the cloister, however, are the carvings on the plates between the colonnettes. A recent count indicated that fifty-one instances still exist, though some are represented by only a small fragment. And the subjects are kaleidoscopic?from a solitary little billet a few inches long to a shield with symbols of the Passion, to full-length human figures. If we add to these a piece of a figure once at Jerpoint but now lost, and are spirally grooved, and they are four inches in diameter (Langrishe records four and one-quarter inches), whereas the thickest at lerpoint are but three and one-half inches in diameter. Also, the one plate available for measurement (1964) is about two and three-quarters inches in thickness, in contrast to two or less at lerpoint.</page><page sequence="8">66 E C. RAE if we assume that the carvings mentioned by Graves and by Carrigan were not brought back to the abbey, the number increases to at least fifty-six, forty-two of them being representations of human figures or parts thereof, lay and religious. In seven instances, a bit of detail is carved onto or incised into the colonnette itself?tiny niches, occupied or vacant, a flower, a leaf, or a cross. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF JERPOINT Eighteen of the carvings on the plates of the piers appear to represent beings of a sanctified nature.18 Of these, only one, St. Margaret (pier 7, north face) is still complete (PI. 10 a). The saint wears a crown with trefoil motifs, apparently a full wimple, and belted, flowing robes caught by a large brooch at the neck. She stands upon a two-legged dragon (wyvern), its tail tied into a knot and its maw pierced by the cross-topped staff of the conqueror. This position of the staff, held in the right hand and crossing the body in order to transfix the head of the beast, is apparently an old convention. It appears, for instance, in a sculptured St. Margaret at Haughmond (Shropshire) considered to date from about 1330. On the north face of pier 17 is the other female saint who can be indubitably identified (PI. 4 a). She is the familiar St. Catherine of Alexandria, whose minia ture wheel of torture, along with the sword of martyrdom, are unmistakable attributes. Identification in other cases is difficult, though the general import is clear. Such is the carving on the north face of pier 11 (PI. 12 a), which must symbolize (if it does not represent) an instance of the triumph of good over evil. A long-robed figure places his right foot upon a beast and thrusts a spear or staff into its upturned mouth. Since its tail is knotted and its head made fear some by long locks or other appendages, we conclude that the four-legged creature is some kind of a dragon. One receives the impression of an actual struggle, however obvious the outcome, since the human form turns in the direction of the observer's right, and the creature below rises up slightly on its hind legs, front legs pawing the air. Although we may find reminiscences of Christ treading on the adder and the basilisk, a more plausible subject would be St. Michael overcoming the dragon. One of the disciples seems surely to be depicted on the north side of pier 12 (PL 5 c). The simply robed, barefoot figure holds in his left hand an object which broadens considerably toward the end. It seems too flat to be a club, and does not resemble a palm, however stylized. Probably we see St. Bartholomew, who appears so frequently along with the other disciples on late Gothic Irish tombs and sometimes on fonts. Although his knife is often scimitar-shaped, it is by no means always so. The instrument of the saint's martyrdom is depicted in a way which is consistent with the long, flat folds of the drapery. This identification of the figure as St. Bartholomew is supported to some extent by the presence on the !8 This count does not include the St. Christopher now built into the north side of pier thirty-eight, nor the pieces of a large and of a small crucifixion. That these ever formed a part of the cloister arcade would be difficult to establish.</page><page sequence="9">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 67 south side of the pier of what appears to be another of The Twelve (PL 6 a). Despite similarity to our St. Bartholomew, there are also two minor but signifi cant differences. The long, simplified object in the left hand broadens less markedly toward the end, and striatums suggest the formula for a convention alized palm. Many Christian martyrs (among them St. Ursula and her ten thousand companions) are frequently shown holding this ancient symbol of triumph?for them a triumph over evil importunities and the death of the body ?but St. John the Evangelist may also carry it, and frequently does so in late Gothic alabasters, where it may be his only attribute.19 St. John, however, was not martyred. In his case it is the palm of Paradise brought to the Virgin by an angel and carried by the beloved disciple before her bier.20 Other instances of St. John with the palm occur on tombs in Kilkenny, Gowran, Ennis, and Water ford. Common in Ireland as well as elsewhere is another tradition, which shows the Evangelist holding a chalice whence frequently issues a dragon or other serpent as a symbol of the poison which the saint's holiness caused to depart. Probably also a saint, but in its present condition not narrowly identifiable, is a crowned figure on the south side of pier 17. A staff, topped by a small cross, is held in the right hand, across the body, much like St. Margaret's. A most readily recognizable and immediately ingratiating member of the sanctified company is a fragmentary St. Christopher (PL 4 b), who takes his place on the east side of pier 30. His ingenuous charm nearly proved his undoing, for this is one of the pieces of the cloister which had been taken to Knocktopher, possibly for use as a headstone. As is well known, representations of St. Chris topher, both carved and painted, were very widespread in the Middle Ages. Presumably every church of any size had a painting of him, placed in a con spicuous location.21 Except for the tender love and care made visible and ex plicit for all believers by representations of the Virgin Mary and the Infant Christ, there is probably no subject in Christian iconography which illustrates more literally the steadfast protection given by a saint. Both this and another St. Christopher at Jerpoint show the solicitous giant actually holding the babe with his left arm, his body bent because of the weight, and his head turned a little in the direction of the precious burden.22 This version on the arcade seems to depict J9 I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Hodgkinson of the Victoria and Albert Museum for drawing my attention to many instances of this nature. 20 See The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine, Granger Ryan and H. Rippinger, trans, and ed., New York, 1941, part 2, pp. 449 ff; or Louis Reau, Iconographie de Van Chretien, Paris, 1956-1959, III, part 2, pp. 709, 712. 21 Francis Bond, An Introduction to English Church Architecture from the Eleventh to the Sixteenth Century, London, O.U.P., 1913, I, p. 49, among others, draws attention to the fact that St. Christopher was commonly painted on the wall opposite the chief doorway, where he would be readily visible. All the faithful who caught sight of the picture were thereby protected from harm for the rest of the day, and especially from sudden death. Though St. Christopher is believed to have been a very large man anyway, the gigantic size of many of his images was probably caused primarily from the desire to make him visible from a distance. 22 The article by Francis J. Bigger, "St. Christopher in Irish Art.," J.R.S.A.I., XL, 1910, pp. 166-168, is misleading. That the lerpoint St. Christopher may have been taken from woodcuts is indeed possible. Prints were readily and cheaply obtained and transported. The woodcut of St. Christopher shown in a picture of about 1435 attributed to Jacques</page><page sequence="10">68 E. C. RAE an undergarment which suggests the furry pelt of St. John the Baptist, or even a high-necked Aran sweater. It is rendered in the same, conventionalized treat ment as the mail gorget of the knight on the north face of pier 3 (PL 3 c). Stunted arms and a hemispherical, broadly smiling face give an aspect to which the term "folk art" might logically be applied. St. James the Greater seems surely to be indicated by a figure with a pouch and staff on pier 33, east face (PL 6 b). Less obvious is the identity of the personage on the reverse of this slab (PL 6 c), although the most palpable suggestion is that it is St. Peter holding the handle of a single key, an iconographic variant of the frequent pair of keys.23 Convincing identification of the persons carved on one of the fragments housed in the east range is indeed elusive. On each side is a part of a figure which is turned to the side, hands clasped, or nearly so. One thinks of the Virgin Mary and St. John in Gothic sculpture and paintings of the Crucifixion, but if it is indeed they, their positions on opposite sides of the support would indicate the complete fragmentation of what is usually a compact group. Our attempt to identify the sanctified figures on the plates nears its end with the carvings on each side of pier 32. Barefoot, simply draped, their attributes probably indicated on the missing upper part of the pier, one can only guess that they are two of the twelve disciples. Perhaps parts of two more occupy another fragment among those collected in the east range. On one a figure with a basket-like pocket of drapery around the middle suggests St. Philip as he is shown in late Irish medieval sculpture, except that instead of three or five small loaves there appears to be one, large, ribbed mass. A smaller fragment preserves on one side a raised hand. It might seem to be the hand of a bishop wearing a bejeweled glove, until it is realized that we probably behold a right hand, palm out. Hence, the round spot may be inter preted not as a jewel but as the mark of a pierced hand, a reference to the Passion. On the other side of this piece is one of several mysterious faces at Jerpoint which defy exact explanation. At first sight it looks like a personifica tion of the sun (PL 10 b), since hair, moustache, and beard form a kind of scalloped aura all around the head. Whatever the head may have been intended to represent, it appears to be a simplified version of that semi-botanical genus Daret (Annunciation, Brussels) shows many of the same characteristics as the lerpoint St. Christophers?the flowering staff, the saint's left arm helping to support the Christ Child, who blesses emphatically with His right hand, the globe of universal authority in His left, the saint looking toward lesus and bending to the observer's left. The water is shown simply by a series of ascending lines. Some English manuscripts and Italian paintings also show the saint and the infant in some kind of rapport, but the details vary considerably, even in a limited area. (See H. C. Whaite, St. Christopher in English Medieval Wallpainting, London, Benn, 1929.) Perhaps from a desire to indicate the arduousness of the task, German and Netherlandish printmakers of the fifteenth century often show the burly strongman too occupied with the swift current and uncertain footing to pay any attention to the child perched upon his shoulders. The gauche St. Christopher at Kilcooley Abbey apparently derives from this type. 23 He appears, for instance, with but one key on a slab in the Cathedral of Cashel and on a tomb in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Thurles. Many continental manuscripts and paintings show him with only one key.</page><page sequence="11">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 69 which has fascinated man throughout the ages?the face with foliate hair, beard, and moustache. In some versions, stems grow out of the mouth, ears, or eyes, as seen on a few of the capitals at Jerpoint. In considering possible prototypes, one recalls good examples in Villard de Honnecourfs thirteenth-century sketch book, and visages of this type peer from many an English vaulting boss.24 But possible models for the Jerpoint faces may be found much less far away. The same motif occurs in thirteenth-century work at Athassel Priory near Golden (Tipperary); another, of the same period, and particularly like some of those at the cloister, occurs in St. Canice's cathedral in Kilkenny; and on one of the capitals of the archway from the nave to the south porch of the cathedral of Cashel is a head surrounded by a flowery ruffle suggestive of the undulating out line of the face on the abbey pier. Far more surely in a celestial category is the wistfully smiling, bust-length cherub, the sole representative of his order and perhaps even of his hierarchy, who appears on the north side of pier 14 (PL 8 a). Modestly provided with but two wings, he is a distant cousin of those members of the heavenly entourage depicted in manuscripts such as an early fifteenth-century Book of Hours in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin.25 Many of the group have the same wavy, leonine arrangement of the hair. In sharpest contrast to the simple effect of this visitor from the court of heaven is the impact of one of the most sacred subjects of the cloister: the Trinity. Only the upper part remains (PL 8 b). Though the Trinity is sometimes depicted in a grandly monumental way, the forms used to represent it are on the other hand often rather mild. But not so here. God appears to press forward, head high, chin out, a thundering Savonarola. His left hand holds the cross; His right, Early Medieval rather than Gothic in its emphatic enlargement and gesture, appears to warn, fully as much as to bless. Here is none of the beaming charm of some of the faces which brighten the arcade. Since most of the work at Jerpoint does not have this powerful quality its presence here may be claimed to be unintentional. Be that as it may, the fact remains that even in its weathered and battered state, this is the masterpiece of expression in the entire claustral assemblage. And it is also one of the most forceful representations of the subject in all late medieval art, in its authority comparable to Masaccio's Trinity in Florence, and Piero della Francesca's Resurrection at Borgo San Sepolcro. Many artists of the period, content with a threadbare formula or misled by an interest in the veristic depiction of the surface of things, failed to penetrate to a pro founder reality. 24 For a large number of illustrations of all sorts of leafy and foliage-embowered faces see Charles J. P. Cave, Roof Bosses in Medieval Churches: An Aspect of Gothic Sculpture, Cambridge, C.U.P., 1948. Miss Helen Roe first brought this fine source to my attention. It is most unlikely that the Irish sculptor intended or perhaps was even aware of the semi-pagan meaning that Cave thinks prompted the Englishmen to use this motif. 25 Manuscript W. 82. The cherubs in front have only two wings, pointed downward, probably an expedient employed to avoid hiding the rest of the group by a proliferation of feathers.</page><page sequence="12">70 E- C. RAE The subject is common in alabaster carvings, one of which is preserved in the Black Abbey in Kilkenny. Often God is depicted with both hands raised, but in some insular sculpture and now and then in continental paintings and prints, the First Person holds or at least touches the cross, and sometimes raises His right hand in blessing.26 Though usually adorned with a long beard, He is some times shown with a short one, as here. A feature of this Irish Trinity, which may be the result of Italian influence, is the tilted halo, for it is difficult to explain as anything else the damaged, rounded object which projects above the head of God. A similar and more obvious in stance is to be found in the halo of St. John the Baptist depicted over the entrance to the church of the priory of the Augustinian Canons of Clontuskert (Ros common), a carving unequivocally dated by an inscription to the year 1471. Although one may adduce exceptions like the haloes of the figures on Bishop Bernward's bronze doors at Hildesheim (early eleventh century), and an occas ional figure in a narrative scene on Romanesque and Gothic facades, such tilted hat-like haloes were rare in purely medieval art, and especially in a frontally posed, upright figure.27 They were sometimes used in Italian art toward the end of the first quarter of the fifteenth century, becoming very common in Italy by 1450. Manuscript illuminations, statuettes, or paintings could have transmitted the idea. Occupying a position between the sanctified and the secular are three church men who form part of the group of figures still preserved at Jerpoint. A priest is portrayed, apparently at a moment during the Mass, hands raised, apart, palms out (PL 9 c). But the gesture is of course not exclusive to the sacred offices; it is, as a matter of fact, fairly common, if in a slightly different form, in alabasters of the Trinity. And the Virgin Mary sometimes makes much the same gesture in her role of Our Lady of Graces and in scenes of the Assumption. Nevertheless, the specific suggestion of Dominus vobiscum is strong. The carving reminds us of the presence of the liturgy. 26 As, for instance, on a tomb in St. Werburgh's, Dublin, and on a stone now in St. Canice's cathedral, Kilkenny, possibly from a mensa tomb. Trinities which seem to be of this type also occur at Methley, Yorkshire (Arthur Gardner, Alabaster Tombs of the Pre Reformation Period in England, Cambridge, 1940, fig. 18) and on a font at Orford, Suffolk (c. 1400; illustrated in Arthur Gardner, A Handbook of English Medieval Sculpture, Cambridge, 1935, fig. 370). Examples in painting occur in Raimond van Marie, Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, The Hague, Nijhoff, 1927, IX. This particular type, with the hand or hands raised, is not stressed in the extensive dis cussion of the Trinity by Adolphe N. Didron, Christian Iconography, E. I. Millington, trans., London, H. G. Bonn, 1851-1886, II, pp. 1-82. 27 Although Giotto in the earliest years of the fourteenth century sometimes painted the halo in a somewhat oval shape, as though seen from an angle, he sought apparently to free the face rather than to apply consistent foreshortening, or to suggest a hat-like character. Later fourteenth-century artists usually returned to the full flat circle. Didron, op. cit., I, pp. 101-106, laments the appearance in the fifteenth century of the headdress-like nimbus worn as if it were a hat. His specific illustrations are of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Norman Gask, Old Silver Spoons of England, London, 1926, p. 68, avers that "very early" apostle spoons (apparently late fifteenth century or about 1500) show the halo set at the back of the apostle's head: later, it is inclined forward.</page><page sequence="13">SCULPTURE IN 1ERP0INT CLOISTER 71 Surely by a different artist, and far less effective as to the gesture (although also far better preserved), is the abbot on pier 2 (PI. 3 a). He wears the garb of a Cistercian monk, and may be considered to stand for the abbot under whom most of the cloister was constructed.28 (In another context he might be thought to be a reference to abbots in general, or again, to the founder of the order.). Any thought of looking upon the figure as a portrait, however, is untenable. The face Ls much like others at Jerpoint, and in any case there is little true portraiture, in contrast to caricature, in sculpture in the British Islands until the end of the Middle Ages. On the back of this slab is one of the best known of the Jerpoint figures, an enthusiastically blessing cleric usually referred to without hesitation as a bishop (PI. 5 a). Such he probably is, although the absence of a mitre is most unusual in Irish bishops who are portrayed giving a blessing or benediction. The figure appears to wear the alb, amice, chasuble, stole, and footgear. His foliate crosier turns outward, but the notion that the crosier of a bishop faces always away from him, that of an abbot toward himself, has too many exceptions to have any real validity in an attempt to differentiate between the two. The close resemblance between this figure and that on a tomb slab in the chancel of the abbey has often been remarked. Here, too, the mitre is lacking. But the contrast between the two figures on pier 2 does indeed seem to be that of abbot versus bishop. The possibility that the bishop may be a reference to Bishop William of Cork, who had been a monk at Jerpoint and died in 1267, soon after his elevation to the episcopal chair, must be considered.29 At any rate, the occupants of pier 2 make us aware of the presence of both regular and secular clergy of importance, and of the blessings of the Church. Except for gisants on their tomb slabs, by far the greater bulk of figure sculpture created in Ireland during the Gothic period consists of figures of sanctified persons. When laymen appear, they are usually associated with some memorial to the dead. Instances occur at Athassel (Tipperary), Dungiven (Derry), and Roscommon; and there are the lady at Ennis (Clare) and the donor at Strade (Mayo). For the rest, lay figures are for the most part represented only by heads and busts on capitals, at the ends of hood moulds, and as caryatid figures (notably at St. Francis' "Abbey", Kilkenny). Hence, the indubitable presence on the Jerpoint piers of six knights, all formerly full-length, three ladies, and a tenth lay person, probably male, is another highly interesting and unusual feature of this remarkable sculptured ensemble. Since knights and ladies are favourites with souvenir collectors, there is a strong probability that there were formerly more. And some of them, at least, were meant to stand for particular families, perhaps specific individuals. The most completely preserved knight 2? In the cloister at Bective appears a carving of an abbot with his coat of arms, and at Holy Cross a shield tells of the abbot who caused the erection of the cloister there (or at least a part of it). Most of the instances in Gardner, Alabaster Tombs, where bedes men or others are shewn with a large "pair" of beads, seem to date from the late fif teenth or early sixteenth century. 29 Carrigan, op. cit., IV, p. 295.</page><page sequence="14">72 E. C RAE carries a shield with a coat of arms ubiquitous for County Kilkenny and often found elsewhere, that of the Butlers (PI. 3, b &amp; c). Other of the knights may likewise have been identified by the insignia on their shields, if we may accept the hypothesis that the armoured men Carrigan saw at Piltown did in fact come from Jerpoint (see note 16). Heraldry was often considered a sufficient and proper way to indicate a person's family name. There is now no trace of any kind of inscription on the cloister arcades, and the generalized style of the sculpture and its unpredictable placement gives cause to doubt that anything as pedestrian as the written word ever formed part of the carved detail. Two of the figures may refer to some of the best known of the Irish nobility of the end of the fifteenth century. On the north side of pier 3 is a little niche carved into the colonnette to the left of the Butler knight, and within the niche is a tiny figure which is thought to represent a monkey (PI. 3, b &amp; c). On the south side of this same pier is the figure of a forceful lady (PL 5 b), and the colonnette at her left has a similar niche, filled with a similar animal. Monkeys (apes) were usually in bad repute during the Middle Ages, but they were also the supporters of the arms of the Fitzgerald Earls of Kildare. How to explain their presence here, deep in Ormond territory? In 1485 occurred a lull in the strident rivalry of these two important clans of the Irish Middle Nation, since at that time Sir Piers Butler (Piers Rua) married Margaret Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald, eighth Earl of Kildare. The suggestion that this fact accounts for the presence of the presumed monkeys is worthy of serious consideration. Artistic licence, rather than a subtle attempt to show the importance of Margaret in Ormond's life, could account for the monkey on his colonnette as well as hers. The fact that the garb of the lady is quite different from that of the Countess on her and Piers' tomb in St. Canice's, Kilkenny, can be explained (see below). The supposition that this particular Ormond-Kildare liaison is commemorated here would, if accepted as true, be a strong factor for dating at least this part of the cloister to 1485 or later.30 But not all of the people who enliven the piers of the cloister can be described as sacred, reverenced, or noble. Some are definitely earthy and ordinary. Since the Church in the Gothic period thought instinctively in all-inclusive terms, these lowly persons were also remembered. One of the hooded figures (Pier 15, south face) gives the impression of standing for nothing other than what he looks like ?an ordinary man, perhaps someone associated with the abbey or one of the sculptors. Several of these genre figures occur on the corbels which form part of some of the stone plates. No one has as yet demonstrated convincingly just what these supports were used for, but since the plate is left rough just above them, it would appear that objects made of stone, perhaps small statues, were fastened to them. Possibly the little hooded man on the south side of pier 9 is 30 This kind of family alliance had taken place on other occasions also, however. In his discussion of the Viscounts Mountgarret, lohn Lodge, The Peerage of Ireland, Mervyn Archdall, ed., Dublin, 1789, IV, p. 7, points out that in 1302 "Edmond le Botilier" married loan, daughter of the first Earl of Kildare; and that (p. 14) the first wife (died 1430) of fames, fourth Earl of Ormond, was "lohan", daughter of the fifth Earl of Kildare.</page><page sequence="15">PI. 2 Jerpoint Abbey cloister : Piers 5 and 6, south face.

And on pier 19 a girl, hair flying, flings her arms upward, the better to fill the space on the under side of a corbel and to suggest its function, but also as if she were in comic rivalry with a heavily bearded man who is similarly engaged on the north face of pier 10. We find at Jerpoint that medieval love of strong and direct contrast?good and evil, lay and clerical, regular and secular, male and female, young and old. In tune with such contrasts is the deliberate and sometimes quixotic pursuit of variety found so frequently in Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts, and now and then in even the structural members of great churches. Well known instances are the nave piers of the cathedrals of Durham and Rochester, and the alteration of round and square supports in the east end of the nave of Jerpoint itself has been noted above. Therefore, in carved detail in Ireland one can almost say that it is complete uniformity that is the exception, although the charm of these spark ling witticisms of the chisel is none the less acceptable merely because we have learned to expect them. The carving of several of the cloister capitals shows well this revelling in sprightly invention (PL 13 c). For a while, the restraining attitude of the Cistercians and the Mendicants, along with the sober self-consciousness of the early Gothic builders, succeeded in curtailing this joyous fantasy, though it managed to survive, if in chastened form, in a few capitals here and there (as at Wells), or took refuge in the grotesques of the roof line. The prodigies throve best during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in Kleinkunst, in misericord, and manuscript, whence they flocked into more prominent sculpture again in the late Gothic period.31 One does not, of course, include in this statement the piquant details appropriate to narrative scenes, wherever they may appear?on tympanum, door jamb, or in stained glass, and there are exceptions such as the portail des Libraires at Rouen. It is in the capitals and bases of the cloister arcade that our abbey displays most fully the renovatio of earlier medieval motifs and predilections; but the im mediate models for the subjects of the sculpture seem seldom to have been Roman esque examples but rather manuscripts of the late thirteenth, fourteenth, and perhaps later centuries.32 Here the world of wonders from past times had been sampled and sometimes added to in a desire to furnish, through folk tales and genre incident, exempla for the sacred texts. Both subject matter and method 31 For a recent and to me convincing expose of this recrudescence, see lurgis Baltrusaitis. Reveits et Prodigues, noted above. 32 The dragon head at the end of a hood mould over the arch of a late Gothic tomb in the ruined church at Kilmacreehy (Clare), however, seems to be a lineal descendant of label stops like those in the nave of Malmesbury Abbey of slightly after 1150. As is well known, late Gothic capitals, string courses, arch spandrels, misericords, firiials, and other parts of stalls and benches often swarm with motley activity. As to the bases at lerpodnt, the motifs and creatures which adorn them are clearly Gothic in character, but their employment in this location is uncommon at this time, and suggests specific Romanesque derivation. (Both Irish and other Romanesque bases furnish many examples of such enlivenment.) In the British Islands, early and high Gothic bases are for the most part quiet constructions of rounded mouldings and fillets.</page><page sequence="28">74 E. C. RAE of presentation suggest the margins of the written page transposed into stone.33 But any aim at precise symbolism or homely illustration in these little carvings is difficult to demonstrate convincingly. In almost no instance do we know which bases, colonnettes, and capitals were originally used together, and the possibility of obtaining clues from any such juxtaposition has therefore been irretrievably lost. Whimsy, rather than the desire to moralize, may have dictated the choice in many cases. The base, colonnettes, and plate of pier 11, however, are carved from a single block of stone, and have never been separated. On the north face of the base, below the fragment of the personage whom we have taken for St. Michael triumphing over a beast (PL 12 a), is what appears to be a snail shell, from which issued the head of a man, now broken off. The snail was sometimes used to symbolize laziness and sin,34 and this semi-anthropomorphic treatment occurs in manuscripts. Perhaps the most monumental representation of the sub ject is a picture by Giovanni Bellini in the Accademia, Venice, where the half length man emerging from the shell is considered to indicate an allegory of shame?shame disclosed?35 or the burden of sin.36 In the instance at Jerpoint the vignette on the base might be considered to be some kind of footnote to the scene above. On the opposite side of the pier, below the remnants of an armoured figure, are two oak leaves. They may have been meant to symbolize the strength of faith, virtue, and Christian endurance.37 But such leaves also occur here and there on the arches. To claim an attempt at symbolism in these latter instances seems hardly tenable. Humour, rather than serious import, makes its appearance on the base selected in the reconstruction of the arcade to support the vigorously blessing cleric (PL 5 a). Here a sort of man-in-the-moon is shown wearing a hood which develops into an arm with the thumb and two fingers raised in a gesture of blessing 33 The use of manuscripts, often of much earlier date, as models for current work recurs again and again in medieval art of the fifth to twelfth centuries. Less commonly stressed is the fact that this also happens in the Gothic period. We find in a catalogue of the Walters Art Gallery, The International Style, Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.A.), 1962, p. xi, that in his cartoons of 1375-1379 for some tapestries of the Apocalypse "lean Bandol used as models manuscripts that had been illuminated in England or in Northern France around 1250 and also fourteenth-century ones..." and the writer notes further how International-Style depictions of this subject sometimes recall the Romanesque. 34 George Ferguson, Signs and Symbols in Christian Art, New York, O.U.P., 1961, p. 25. 35 Raimond van Marie, The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, The Hague, XVII, 1935, p. 279. 36 Philip Hendy and Ludwig Goldscheider, Giovanni Bellini, Oxford and London, Phaidon, 1945, Fig. 77. The symbolism of a human figure partly in a shell must have lent itself to various interpretations, however, if we are to agree with Francis Bond, Wood Carving in English Churches, London, O.U.P., 1910, I, pp. 137-138, that an instance he cites is serious rather than satirical or whimsical. Although Bond feels that symbolism, except for that of the animals of the bestiary, was rare on misericords, which "were carved by simple folk for simple folk", he opines that on a misericord of 1370 at Lincoln a "naked child issuing from a spiral shell and confronting a dragon or wyvern... denotes the conflict of purity and vice." It would be interesting to know whether Bond had primary evidence for this statement or whether he drew his conclusion from the fact that the dragon and his kin in battle usually stand for evil, and that their antagonists should normally therefore symbolize the good. 37 Ferguson, op. cit., p. 35.</page><page sequence="29">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 75 (PL 11 a).38 Its appropriateness is obvious: the little figure echoes and emphas izes what is going on above, if with a slightly comic innuendo. Comparable drolleries enliven many a manuscript page. Also somewhat jocose is the little man lying down on the south face of the base of pier 8 (PL 11 b). A mild expose of luxuria is a possible interpretation, inasmuch as the figure appears to have prominent genitals. Such details are seldom emphasized or even acknowledged in insular Gothic sculpture. A derog atory implication may be assumed on analogy with the evil executioner, likewise obviously equipped, in an English alabaster retable of about 1480.39 Perhaps the little Irish miscreant suggests sloth, though this vice was sometimes exemplified by a person too lazy to get out of bed. On the north side of this same base is that not uncommon marvel of illuminated books and incidental sculpture, the head with three faces, two in profile, one full front, all of which share the same pair of eyes (PL 12, c &amp; d). Since the colonn ettes and plate above are a plain, apparently modern restoration, there is no clue on the spot as to specific meaning for the carving. Multi-headed or multi-faced creatures are of course found in many cultures, and three-faced depictions of, or satires on, the Trinity occur in Christian art, East and West.40 However, if the three-faced phenomenon was originally found beneath the slab with the Trinity (now pier 29, west face), the lusty little man on the other side of the base would then take his place below the officiating priest. An explanation which is more acceptable is that the tripart phenomenon at Jerpoint was suggested by a type which derives ultimately from the Janus head of antiquity as it was em ployed in medieval calendars.41 The Janus head has but two faces, however. The third (full front) may have originated from the fancy of the artist, as Dodwell suggests, but this supposition would not necessarily invalidate the interpretation of one face as referring to the past, the second to the present, the third to the future.42 Whether or not such implications were viable for the Jerpoint artist and his audience, the phenomenon doubtless fascinated its observers as an in stance of the many curious things about us, seen and unseen. One questions whether the artist has completely understood his model or had ever done such a subject before. Nevertheless, he has preserved its unique character to the full. 38 An antiphoner of the Cistercian abbey of Beaupre (near Grammont), a Flemish work dated 1290, still exhibits several such pictorial quips, although many of them have been erased. An example occurs on plate 54 of Burlington Fine Arts Club, Exhibition of Illuminated Manuscripts, London, 1908. 39 Illustrated in Arthur Gardner, English Medieval Sculpture, Cambridge, 1951, Fig. 609. 40 Mgr. X. Barbier de Montault, Traite d'iconographie chretienne, Paris, Louis Vives, 1890, II, pp. 23 and 26, gives a brief but useful discussion and some illustrations of the three faced Trinity in the arts. Didron, Christian Iconography, II, goes into the subject in detail. 41 See C. R. Dodwell, The Canterbury School of Illumination, Cambridge, 1954, p. 65 and plate 37. For the possibility of satire, see L. Maeterlinck, Le genre satirique dans la peinture flamande, Brussels, van Ouest, 1907, pp. 59-60. He adduces a grotesque semi human figure with a three-faced head very like that at Jerpoint in type except that it wears a crown. Any possibility that this carving at lerpoint might have been meant to symbolize Prudence or Philosophy seems very remote. *2 Bond, Wood Carving, I, p. 116.</page><page sequence="30">76 E. C. RAE Too often the triune head degenerates into the type where a self-consciously adept carver, skilled in mimicry but not in expressive content, creates a full face and two semi-profiles, each of the three with its own pair of eyes, with the result that the wondrous sense of three-in-one evaporates. The fine preservation of this provocative subject contrasts with the sorry state of the carving on the base of pier 18, north side. We seem to see an arm bent toward the place where there was probably once a head, while from behind a hand grasps the arm near the wrist. The smashing of this carving probably has robbed us of one of the most interesting pieces in the cloister. Mention must also be made of the frequent occurrence of the human head. As in England, it is a favourite motif. It appears in almost every conceivable place : as tiny griffes on the corners, as well as on the long sides of the bases; on the plate; on the bells of the capital of pier 3; on the arches; and on the capitals, often enmeshed in foliage and sometimes related to hands which grasp stems (PL 13 c), much as in earlier work at Cashel and Athassel. Among the miscellaneous subjects which appear to have been catapulted onto the arches by the bursting energy that chiseled the carvings below is one which is particularly fascinating, and also particularly challenging. On the soffit of the second arch from the north in the present west range is a wreathed face, start lingly suggestive of that of Bacchus (PL 10 d). Even the leaves resemble those of the grape. To be sure, heads surrounded by foliage occur frequently as part of the galaxy which sprinkles the vaulting bosses in English Decorated and Per pendicular work (for instance, at the cathedral of Exeter and at St. Mary Redcliffe in Bristol), and proliferates into the veritable cosmos on the ceiling of the Great Cloister at Canterbury. But the foliage in these English instances is to a great extent of a different type, and its arrangement is usually unlike that of the Jerpoint wreath, which is bound at the bottom and expands toward the top. Closer in kinship are wreathed faces in Italian fifteenth-century manuscripts.43 The pagan aspect results largely from that same smile which endears so many of the Jerpoint figures. As in much archaic Greek sculpture, it has a contagious effect of buoyant vitality. Was the smile intended to depict joy, or was it the outcome of a naive desire to endow the figures with a suggestion of liveliness ? 43 A perusal of a number of reproductions of northern manuscripts of the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries shows that most of the heads which are surrounded by foliage are not full face, nor round, nor in wreaths like the lerpoint one. Barbier de Montault, Traite, Fig. 255, illustrates some medieval rondels of heads of ancient gods; a Sylvanus is close to the lerpoint head. Another pagan parallel is apparent in a Roman sardonyx plaque with a Medusa face in the Louvre. Here the wreath of snakes and hair is tied at the bottom and expands toward the top. The possibility of influence from antiquity via an Italian fifteenth-century manuscript cannot be ruled out. But neither can one deny that English examples, metamorphosed by a local feeling for form, may have played their part. Amongst the many carvings on the vaults of the cloister of the cathedral of Worcester is a wreathed head in the north walk which, if the leaves suggested those of the grape, could logically be championed as the actual protoype for the Temoint carving under discussion. And among the foliage-embowered faces reproduced by Cave, Roof Bosses, figs. 38, 73, 74, 115, 116, 301-319, the one that comes closest to the enigmatic lerpoint visage is found, perhaps significantly, at St. Mary Redcliffe in Bristol (Cave, Fig. 38). As is well known, throughout most of the medieval period there were close contacts between Ireland and western England, especially Bristol.</page><page sequence="31">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 77 That some of the sculptors were fully aware of the role of facial expression, and able to vary it as they wished, is proved by the grotesque on the east side of the base of pier 35 (PL 11 c). Here the downturned mouth succeeds completely in expressing petulance. More enigmatic is an easily overlooked face on the chamfer of arch 17 (PL 9 a). The type of beard and cap may suggest to contemporary eyes a leprechaun, or even the new-world Santa Claus, but the weathering away of the finer details and slight "Mona Lisa" smile give a veiled and introspective mood more like that of a meditating Buddha. No other face at Jerpoint engenders a greater feeling of the experience of the transcendental. But the aura of age and hand of Time do much to dignify and sanctify. In its original condition the head may well have been but an impish instance of the stonecutter's joy in his part in creating a sculptured cloister that was not only deeply significant in a specifically religious sense, but also beautiful and entertaining on other grounds. On turning from the realms of the heavenly and the human to that of the lower beings, one is struck by the fact that there are very few depictions of ordinary animals in the cloister. Although among the little griffes may be found the head of a pig (PL 12 b) and of a fox or dog, and we have noted the tiny monkeys in niches on the colonnettes, the little squirrel nibbling a nut (presum ably) on the north side of pier 6 can lay claim to being the only fully portrayed animal of the kind that one would have expected to see under ordinary circum stances in Ireland at the time.44 It is similarly depicted in many a manuscript. Far more frequent are creatures of less common anatomical construction, especially those loosely referred to as dragons. In western art the dragon usually connotes evil; yet, it has also been claimed that "the scowling and grin ning faces, the half-human forms, the gorgons, griffins, and winged dragons of legendary folk lore were considered to be invested with the power of driving away evil spirits, and as a charm against witchcraft, etc." (PL 7 b).45 One may certainly question the universal application of such a generalization as regards Christian art (for instance, the dragon which seizes a man's hand on pier 8 (PL 13 c) does not seem to be engaged in frightening away evil spirits), but the psychological complex upon which it touches may help to ex plain the widespread acceptance, even glorification, of the monstrous which is often encountered in medieval art and in expressionistic or highly romantic phases of other cultures. There is no question as to the meaning or appropriate 44 Medieval bestiaries speak of the squirrel's extraordinary capacity for rage. Edward P. Evans, Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture, London, Heinemann, 1896, p. 223, describes the squirrels carved at Ely cathedral as "symbols of the constant strivings of the Holy Spirit." It is difficult to claim specific symbolism for the Jerpoint squirrel. Probably just about everyone has a liking for representations of this busy little creature from the Mirror of Nature, especially when it is shown seated in this quasi-human fashion. Robert L. Praeger, Natural History of Ireland, London, 1950, p. 184, draws attention to the fact; that squirrels were formerly abundant in this county, their skins being an article of export until the middle of the seventeenth century, when they seem to have become extinct. They were reintroduced about the beginning of the nineteenth century. 45 Sidney Heath, The Romance of Symbolism, London, Francis Griffith, 1909, p. 206.</page><page sequence="32">78 E. C. RAE ness when a dragon (or wyvern; the distinction will not be continued herein), prone beneath the feet of a saint or bishop, turns its head upwards in a well rehearsed gesture of ineffectiveness to receive the thrust of the staff (Pis. 10 a &amp; 12 a). But what of the turbulent, leering saurian on pier 5 (PL 2)? It is surely evil incarnate, glorying in its physical well-being and occupying as honored and im portant a position in the cloister as any of the saints or indeed the Trinity! Is it here as a reminder of the power and perpetual presence of the Devil? We recall, however, that a veritable phalanx of sanctified powers crowds several of the adjoining piers. The reaction of the medieval observer may have been similar to ours when we see a man-eating tiger or a deadly serpent caged in a zoo: danger shackled, but not so completely as to dull the thrill resulting from its physical nearness. And on another level of significance, though prob ably less applicable in this instance, the dragon stood in a more general way for power, power claimed by the aggressive person who boldly displayed the creature on his standard or as a supporter for his coat of arms. Also highly significant, though less categorical and less acceptable to those who assume the presence of rationable symbolism at every turn, is the appeal of the dragon to man's love of the marvellous. Nor can we deny that to the sculptor, faced with composing his spaces, these monsters would have been particularly welcome in that they had great flexibility as to form and proportion, expandable and compressible at will, easily drawn out into a long horizontal, an imposing vertical, or whipped up into undulating movement. The creature on pier 5 (PL 2), save for the head, bears a strong resemblance to such decorative late Romanesque dragons as those on the tomb slab in St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick which is pointed out as the memorial to King Dona! M6r O Brien. On the other side of this pier is a long-tailed quadruped wearing a double peaked hood on his anthropomorphic head (PL 10 c).46 The appropriate base displays what seems to be a monkey's head, or it may be a man's, enframed by a dragon which takes its own tail in its mouth to make the ellipse complete.47 We have seen how the scaly swarm has also invaded the capitals, which are otherwise largely derivative from thirteenth-century work as it is seen at Cashel, Athassel, and Kilkenny. Sometimes stylized foliage and flowers partly hide the bold actions of the lurking brutes. 46 Usually mistakenly perceived as a dragon, the peaks of the hood being misinterpreted as widely opened jaws. This hood with two points, one on each side of the head, is thought to have first appeared in actual wear at about the time of Edward II (1307-1327) according to Herbert Norris, Costume and Fashion, Volume II, Senlac to Bosworth : 1066-1485, London, 1927, p. 211. 4~ Two dragons form a comparable enframement in an initial Q in a book printed in Strassbourg in 1471, illustrated in Baltrusaitis, Reveils et Prodigues, pi. 230. As is pointed out by (among others) James A. Notopoulos in "Notes", Classical Journal, XL, December, 1944, p. 171, this ancient symbol, the "serpent in a circle," has been used to denote eternity?the "tail eating serpent without beginning or end, particularly used as a Neoplatonic symbol." A folk tale, perhaps a concoction of this symbolism with the concept of the endless movement of the wheel, astounds with the account of a serpent known as a hoop snake which will upon occasion take its tail in its mouth and roll along like a wheel. If the head within the circle is actually a death's head (which I doubt), something of the symbolism of eternity may still persist.</page><page sequence="33">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 79 The popular two-legged grotesque, usually winged and often endowed with a human head or legs, is particularly well represented by the scampering imp on the north face of pier 15 (PL 7 b). Another marvel, one which often occurs on Romanesque capitals, is the creature with two bodies which share a single head. In this case the head is that of a maiden, with the result that one has the dis quieting impression that harpies lurk somewhere in its ancestry (PL 7 d). (At the time of writing, this slab was in private hands.) Dislocation, weathering, and various degrees of destruction add to the hazards of assigning specific meanings or symbolism to the members of this polyglot family, a veritable Noah's Ark of medieval imagination, augmented, revived, and reinterpreted over the centuries. And the Mirror of Nature reflects also, in its ever searching turnings, elements from the botanical realm?leaves and acorns, now gathered together on capitals, now scattered onto plate, base, and arch; here realistic in presentation, there highly stylized. THE DATE OF THE CLOISTERS In the light of published documents known to the writer, no part of Jerpoint Abbey can be said to be indisputably dated, nor, as has been indicated, is the time of its foundation precisely known. Of possible significance for the date of the cloister are a donation made by the second Earl of Ormond in 1364 and additional gifts made before 1400.48 But it was during the time of James Butler, fourth Earl of Ormond (1405-1452) and the abbacy of David Mortymer, which extended from at least about 1431 to 1456, that Jerpoint appears to have enjoyed especially good fortune. The Earl had been renting certain lands to the abbey for several years and finally gave them outright in 1449. In 1445-1446 one Richard Walshe also bestowed lands upon Jerpoint.49 The effect of these gifts should be considered together with a hand some indulgence, to be valid in perpetuity, granted in favour of the abbey in 1442 "for the conservation, repair, etc., of the church of the Cistercian monastery of St. Mary the Virgin, Jerpoint (de Jeriponte) in the diocese of Ossory (whose cloister, dormitory, bell-tower and other offices are in need of much repair) and the chapel of St. Moling which belongs to the said monastery."50 The language of this document, like that of many other indulgences of the fifteenth century, suggests that the actual cloister arcade was meant. Of the effectiveness of such grants from the Holy See there is little doubt. Otherwise we would not encounter the occasional attempts on the part of rival orders or the secular clergy to prevent their fulfilment. Not merely repairs but a whole new building programme often followed the granting of such a benefit, *8 Newport B. White, ed., Irish Monastic and Episcopal Deeds, A.D. 1200-1600, Dublin. 1936, pp. 6 and 7-12 passim. 49 ibid., pp. 15; 28-29. 50 (See note 7).</page><page sequence="34">80 E- C. RAE though sometimes not until after a number of years.51 Again, and although items cited out of context must always be used with great caution, the fact that Jerpoint was valued in 1453 at twenty marks and in 1466 at fifty, may also have some bearing on the matter.52 If the style of the cloister, like that of the tower, should give the appearance of being a characteristic construction of the middle of the fifteenth century, one would be tempted to conclude on the basis of this entry in the papal records that the arcades are fairly surely dated to that time. But their style is not what is thought to be typically mid-fifteenth century. Although the round-topped arch may have been used at Holy Cross at about that moment,53 and at Muckross friary54 and perhaps Kilconnell55 somewhat later, the greater majority of cloister arcades of the years 1400-1500 are pointed, if sometimes only slightly. On the other hand, the filleted mould within a chamfer used on the garth side of the arches looks like a simplification of the mouldings at the Franciscan friary at Askeaton (Limerick). The arcade at Askeaton, one of the most finely constructed in all Ireland, appears to have been built between 1420 and the middle of the century.56 Also comparable to practice at Askeaton is the use of a salient colonnette, now placed on the inner angles of the northeast and north west corner piers at Jerpoint. This is an architectural nicety for which there was no real structural necessity. In the reconstruction at the abbey a piece of a mould suggesting a colonnette has been placed in the reentrant angle of these piers (that is, on the side toward the garth). Although the present arrangement of the arcades is logical and appropriate, certain details suggest that originally they were not so regular. As regards more purely architectural matters, as distinguished from style in figure sculpture, the outstanding feature at the Jerpoint cloister is the close relationship of some of the capitals to thirteenth-century work as seen at the cathedral of Cashel, Athassel Priory, and St. Canice's and St. John's in Kilkenny. Also significant is the fact that there exist at Cashel two capitals and corbel shafts of later medieval times which derive directly from earlier work and which could plausibly have been done by one of the stonecutters who worked on the arcade at the abbey (PL 13 b). 51 For instance, one would assume that new construction at Clontuskert (Roscommon) would have followed soon after the indulgence of 1413, which was to have been valid during ten years (Cal. Papal Registers, VI, p. 413.). But the most noteworthy evidence of embellishment at this foundation, the west doorway, is unassailably dated to 1471. Was the indulgence unsuccessful as regards helping the abbey ? Was it regranted but the record thereof lost ? Was the remuneration kept and added to until 1471? Does the dated work have no relation whatever to the grant of 1413? Each such instance requires thorough investigation before one may make even a reasonable guess. 52 Gearbid Mac Niocaill, Na Manaigh Liatha in Eirinn 1142-1600, Dublin, 1959. p. 162. 53 Leask, Irish Churches, III, p. 141. 54 ibid., p. 142. 55 Ibid, pp. 99-101. 56 Ibid., p. 101.</page><page sequence="35">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 81 One of these corbels is in the north, the other in the south wall of the nave of the cathedral, just west of the crossing.57 The arches which spring from them rise for only a few feet, and have left no trace higher in the wall. The corbels consist of a capital with a wreath of foliage and a short length of engaged colon nette which ends on the north side on a dragon with a hand clenched in its mouth, and on the south on the head of a bishop. The abaci of these two capitals are like those of the Jerpoint colonnade?a simple rectangular projection, on the lower edge of which is a quarter-round. None of the earlier capitals at Cashel have been observed to use this type of abacus, nor does there appear to be any use of it on foliate capitals of thirteenth-century date anywhere in the country. But it occurs everywhere on the cloister arcade at Jerpoint.58 Another point of similarity between these two late foliate capitals at the cathedral of Cashel and those at Jerpoint is a half-round inserted between the wreath of leaves and the tapering bell below. Most of the earlier foliate capitals at the cathedral have stems running up the bell. In those few instances where the bells are plain, the tradition of the "stiff-leaf" stalk nonetheless prevents separating the leaves from the rest of the capital by a moulding. The start of a change of concept is furnished by the late thirteenth-century work at Hore Abbey below the Rock of Cashel, a Cistercian house founded by Archbishop Mac Carwill in 1272. Here the stalks have been replaced by trapezoidal enframements. With the advent of the Decorated style, any suggestion of a plant growing up against the bell of the capital was lost. The later sculptors felt free to place a horizontal mould just below the wreath of leaves, thereby repeating the readjustment of concept that presumably took place in the origin and development of the Greek Ionic capital?from a suggestion of upward movement to the more static horiz ontal. A third characteristic which separates both the Jerpoint capitals and their relatives at Cashel from most early and middle Gothic work is the way in which the lower lobes of the trefoil are carved. In work of the twelfth and thir teenth centuries, these lesser elements often appear to be the ends of fat spirals, though sometimes simplified into a hemispherical button. But that phase of the late Gothic which tends toward simple geometry, noted in the abacus, makes these lateral leaflets, in nearly all instances, little more than low hemispherical 57 They seem quite at heme in their present location. An old photograph, however, shows either one of them or else another capital of the same vintage lying on the ground. The two capitals under the arch to the north transept of St. Mary's cathedral in Limerick belong to this same type. 5S This type of abacus is little other than the broad fillet and lower curve of a filleted half round. It is an example of the simpler of the two styles of mouldings which were in vogue in the latter half of the fifteenth century and first half of the sixteenth. The whole capital of the arcade of the cloister at the Franciscan friary at Creevelea (Leitrim) consists of but a convex and a concave arc, finished by simpler projections above and below. It is surely dated after 1536 (Leask, Irish Churches, III, pp. 149-150). The broad, flat fillet of the lerpoint work occurs also at Clontuskert in 1471, and gives the effect of the simple quarter-round, semi-circle, and right angle which were so popular in mould ings at the end of the Gothic age in Ireland.</page><page sequence="36">82 E- C. RAE shapes set upon a disk.59 (The suggestion of a more naturalistic articulation con tinues in the middle lobe.) The only instance noted at Cashel where the more naturalistic treatment is not carried out in presumably thirteenth-century work is on the unfinished exterior of the north doorway of the nave. Unfortunately, these corbel capitals at Cashel, so closely related to the Jerpoint work, are far from being dated. Obviously an outgrowth of known thirteenth century work, they can with the greatest likelihood of accuracy be considered either a late and rather mechanical example of the unbroken traditions of that time, hence about 1300, or else to be an instance of the revival of interest in the High Gothic couched in the simplified, less involved geometry which, as men tioned above, is one of the manners of Irish Gothic of the later fifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth. There appears to be nothing to justify con necting the details under discussion with the years 1410-1440, although Arch bishop Richard O Hedian (Hedien), who held the see at that time, is credited with having constructed the hall of the vicars choral (an almost featureless build ing) and also apparently made some changes to his cathedral.60 Hence, the purely architectural features of the abbey cloister would not con tradict the hypothesis that the arcade was for the most part built after the year 1442, when the indulgence was granted for the specific purpose of improving the state of the cloister and other buildings. We turn now to what would seem at first consideration to be an obvious and simple matter but which in some instances is perplexing: the evidence of the costume in which some of the figures are clothed. The type of garb of the sancti fied, the churchmen and the common folk is to a large extent non-committal in this case. The saints, particularly, wear for the most part the all-enveloping simple robes which had been used for centuries without much change in type or arrangement. Some of the nobles wear more distinctive clothing and defensive devices, but these items do not fall obviously and neatly into narrow chronological limits. Writers on the subject of style in clothing point out that, generally speaking, the costume of the upper classes in the later middle ages underwent some marked changes, sometimes rapidly. But upon occasion there was a delay in the accep tance of a new mode; now and then it was completely rejected by a whole region, or by large segments of the population within a given culture. (In modern times this is evident at one end of the social scale in folk-art finery which perpetuates modes of the eighteenth or even seventeenth century; and at the 59 An exception occurs in the capital on the east face of pier 26. Here some of the foliage is more fully articulated in the fashion usual in the thirteenth century. Later thirteenth-century work at St. Canice's in Kilkenny sometimes approaches the simple profiles of Jerpoint. 60 We may interpret thus the exaggerated statement that he probably "new built or at least repaired the cathedral" given by Sir James Ware, The Antiquities and History of Ireland, Walter Harris, ed. and trans., Dublin, 1739-1746, p. 8 of the section on the archbishops of Cashel. The claim of the Bishop of Lismore and Waterford that O Hedian was adamant against having Englishmen become part of the hierarchy under his direc tion, and that he made himself "King of Munster", suggests that the archbishop was part of the Gaelic resurgence of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="37">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 83 other end, in the continued use by a dowager queen of a style of hat which may have come into vogue during her youth.) In some instances marked variations in dress existed contemporaneously. And despite a technique which often favored depicting minute detail, the Irish artists of the Jerpoint cloister upon occasion omitted such things as buttons and the like if they found them un interesting or bothersome. Of particular significance in the realm of costume are details on the capital of pier 3. In the zone of the bell there were once four heads: one on the side toward the garth, another on the side toward the walk, and one on the north and the south sides between the individual bells. Those toward the walk and the garth have been almost completely destroyed, though enough remains of the former (Pis. 5 b &amp; 9 b) to indicate fairly surely that it depicted a man with long, curly hair. On the north side about half of the head of a knight is left (PL 3 b). He wears a bascinet or skull, to which is added a mail gorget, neither of which would be out of place for a knight at any time from the fourteenth century to the sixteenth. But the head on the south side is more specific as to period. It bears a tall, conical headdress (PL 9 b). At first sight one thinks of a mitre. But there seems to be but one point, and there is no cleft between front and rear. A slight variation of the surface makes the bottom of the cone appear to be a decagon. The appearance is not at all like that of the mitre shown on a head on the north side of the capital of pier 14. The headgear of this head on pier 3 is tilted back so that the foremost plane makes an angle with the axis of the neck of about forty-five degrees, and at the lower edge is a slight offset which suggests the inter polation of a band of some kind of material.61 One is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that the head is that of a woman wearing a headdress known as the cornet, a steeple-cap form of hennin. This bizarre piece of costume was especially favored by the extravagant court of the dukes of Burgundy. It appears to have been a la mode for certain occasions in France during the second and third quarters of the fifteenth century,62 although some examples apparently appeared at an earlier date. In England it seems to have had some vogue by the middle of the century, being displaced by a simpler type, the point cut off, about 1470.63 61 Although the figure wears a high collar, which might conceivably be interpreted as an amice, this turned-up collar is readily illustrated in lay garb of the late Gothic period. See, for instance, Francis M. Kelly and Randolph Schwabe, A Short History of Costume and Armour, Chiefly in England, 1066-1800, London, 1931, fig. 25b. 62 Norris, Costume and Fashion, 1927, pp. 445 ff., is fairly sure that the steeple-cap first appeared in France about 1428. An early instance which he illustrates (figure 619 A) is little, if any, higher than the sculptured one under discussion. Wolfgang Bruhn and Max Tilke, A Pictorial History of Costume, English edition, New York, 1955 [?] present as their figure 13 on plate 44, which they describe as "France 14th century," a steeple cap draped with a veil. They call it "the new-fashioned conical hat (steeple cap)." These same authors give illustrations of other examples dated 1470 and 1477. A well known illustration of this headdress occurs in the Madonna and St. Catherine and Other Saints by Memling, probably 1468 (once at Chatsworth). E. E. Viollet-le-Duc, Diction naire raisonne de Varchitecture francaise du XIe au XVIe si&amp;cle, Paris, Bance, 1854-1868. II, pp. 200 ff., considers that high, pointed hennins came into use c. 1420-1430 and disappeared 1470-1475. 63 Norris, op. cit., pp. 447 and 448. He finds that about 1450 the hennin with double veil was adopted for full dress by noble English ladies.</page><page sequence="38">84 E- C. RAE The marriage between Charles the Bold of Burgundy and Margaret of York in 1467 must have strengthened interest in things Burgundian, but it has been questioned that the steeple-cap ever gained a "real vogue" in England "in its fullest development."64 That this tall, single-peaked headdress should have ap peared in Ireland in actuality or in representations before 1430 or 1440 is there fore improbable; about the middle of the century or the last half is much more plausible; and at any time it may have been looked upon as an interesting con tinental oddity. In the light of present information, the example at Jerpoint seems to be unique in Irish sculpture. Perhaps its appearance in County Kilkenny resulted from the cosmopolitan interests and involvements of some of the Butlers. The steeple-cap appears again and again in continental histories and books of hours of the later fifteenth century. Directly below this apparently weighty evidence as to date, however, is what appears at the outset to be a most unsettling factor. We see a lady clad in a dress (PL 5b) which resembles the cotehardie, or even thesurcoat, in a form which would not be considered on the whole inappropriate for the middle or last half of the fourteenth century as the style of that time is usually instanced in the popular handbooks on fashion. The long lappets attached to the sleeves, and the fichets (slits) in the front into which the hands are thrust are, or course, the items which immediately recall that period. The row of prominent buttons on the dress of the maiden on a slab from Jerpoint (PL 7 c) heightens the suggestion. As to the lappets, in the later middle ages drooping appendages from the arms had great popularity. They can be found in almost every quarter-century from 1350 to 1550. Such effects were achieved by having the arms protrude through a slit made in the sleeve near the elbow, letting the rest dangle casually; or by attaching freely hanging strips of material above the elbow; widening the sleeve fantastically toward the end; or making it very baggy but with a tight cuff.65 And lappets, or lappet-like sleeves, must have been very popular in Kilkenny, at least from the time of the droll caryatids beneath the tower of the Franciscan friary of 64 Kelly and Schwabe, op. cit., p. 45. They point out that this type of headdress does not appear on English effigies and brasses, and in "English art" (presumably graphic art) only in markedly truncated form. 65 For instance: examples in the Luttrell Psalter (British Museum Add. MS 42130) of c. 1340; the "weeper" representing loan of Carlisle on the tomb of Edward III, 1377; ladies with lappets hanging to the ground illustrated in "Les Chroniques de Saint Denis" (British Museum MS Roy 20), c. 1400 or early fifteenth century (figs. 276, 278, and 279 in Mary G. Houston, Medieval Costume in England and France: the 13th, 14th and 15th Centuries, London, 1939, (reprinted 1950); the portrayal of the artist who made the Book of the Benefactors of St. Albans' Abbey, which covers the period c. 1390-1445 (see Mrs. Charles H. Ashdown, British Costume during Nineteen Centuries, London, n.d., fig. 173). A very late example is afforded by the tomb of Sir Thos. Cave (d. 1558) at Stanford-on-Avon (illustrated in Arthur Gardner, Alabaster Tombs of the Pre Reformation Period in England, Cambridge, C.U.P., 1940, figs. 304 and 305). Here the appendages of the men's garb consist of the sleeves of the outer garments which hang free, the arms being thrust through slits part way up the sleeve; the women's lappets are somewhat longer, and appear to be fixed to the rest of the dress at the inner side of the upper arm. A striking, late example is also to be found in Pieter Breugel's Adoration of the Magi in the National Gallery (London) of 1567.</page><page sequence="39">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 85 most probably about 1S47.66 Unlike earlier examples, the elegant attachments of the Jerpoint figures are affixed below the elbow and appear to be actual pro longations of the sleeves (simplified by the sculptor) in contrast to the obviously artificial, applied character of most of those shown in fourteenth-century sculpture and illumination. And as regards the fichets, although they are featured in much elegant dress of the years c. 1340-1400, they were by no means limited to the fourteenth century.67 On the other hand, the emphatic, en face fashion in which three Jerpoint figures (the third is no longer visible at the abbey and seems to be lost) are using the fichets suggests strongly influence from fourteenth-century representations. The headdress of the lady on the plate of pier 3 is very different indeed from the hennin above. If the thirteenth-century crespinette is ruled out, the earliest Gothic coiffeur which has any relation to the one in question is that which was fashionable in the second and third quarters of the fourteenth century. At that time ladies brought the hair down on each side of the face in a rectangular, oblong mass, and a filet or coronet gave a strongly rectangular aspect to the whole. A second, more plausible possibility is that the Jerpoint lady wears a meagre version of the imposing, reticulated headdress of the fifteenth century, when fashion decreed encasing the hair in beautiful, bejeweled stuffs which extend to a greater or lesser distance to the sides, as can be seen in so many English alabas ter tombs.68 But although the continuation of the "squareflower" decoration of the side pieces across the top might be explained as artistic license, is the narrow ness of these lateral elements to be explained by the sculptor's penchant for geometric simplification? Another detail which troubles this comparison to the fifteenth-century reticulated headgear is that at the lower ends a bit of hair or some kind of nether covering appears to escape the decorated enframement of the face. A third possibility is that this stately dame is wearing a version of the type of head covering associated with the reign of Henry VII (1485-1509) or even Henry VIII (1509-1547). (One authority, upon seeing a photograph of the lady, immedi ately proposed a date of 1520.) Although the pointed gable (or kennel) shape im mediately comes to mind when one thinks of early Tudor times, it was not the only version worn.69 The Jerpoint lady may be wearing the undercap, "often 66 Long lappets occur on the dress of a man and a woman on a large tomb slab in the churchyard of St. Mary's (now a parochial hall), Kilkenny; shorter ones are seen adorn ing a male figure on a slab in the ruined chancel of the same structure, and also dis tinguish a figure now built into an outbuilding on a farm not far from Callan, a few miles from the city of Kilkenny. (Mrs. W. J. Phelan kindly told me of this last-named instance.) 67 Such openings, richly trimmed, occur in the sides of the dalmatic in which Henry IV (d. 1413) is shown on his tomb in Canterbury. Fidiets can be illustrated in the middle of the fifteenth century (Norris, op. cit., fig. 548) and also in the latter part of the century, as in a female figure perched upon a horse in the frescoes of 1479-1488 at Eton College Chapel. 68 And also in the gisant of Marguerite of Bavaria of 1466-1470 in the Museum of Fine Arts at Dijon, which presents the effect of a square-topped headdress, the hair also covered at the sides. 69 Norris, op. cit., Ill, Bk I, pi 62, finds it first illustrated in 1490.</page><page sequence="40">86 E- C. RAE edged with a jewelled embroidery", surmounted, however, not by the much used velvet hood with lappet-like divisions down each side of the face, but by "a similar hood of plain linen . . . with a stiffened edge framing the face" (the edge apparently omitted here) which falls "in ample folds to the shoulders and neck."70 And, finally, it is noted that when the caul (a close-fitting coif-like headdress of this time) was worn with a fillet or coronet "it was very like hair styles at the end of the fourteenth century." As to the treatment of the hair of the maiden (PL 7 c), young girls at various times wore the hair long, and older women did so also upon occasion in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.71 The separation of the strands in the middle could be meant to suggest the effect of a beck, or peak.72 Hence, all things considered, there is no reason to hold that the two figures of women under discussion could not have been carved in the later fifteenth or early sixteenth century. A similar conclusion may be reached as regards the knights. The fact that their armour resembles, at least superficially, what was for the most part the dernier cri in court circles during the fourteenth century does not mean that the Jerpoint figures were carved then. Instances may be adduced to show that the same general type of armour occasionally persisted in the gisants of the English nobility in the fifteenth century73 and was the "workaday" defense of many warriors well down into the sixteenth, especially in Ireland. Highly distinctive of the knight on pier 3, north side, is the helmet (PL 3 c), which is considered to be of a type of indubitable Italian origin. It has been pointed out that it is depicted in certain Italian paintings of the later fourteenth 70 C.

Crossley, English Church Monuments A.D. 1150-1550, London, B. T. Batsford, 1921, p. 197 (c. 1494) and p. 224, which shows the monument of Sir William Smythe (d. 1525), one of whose wives wears the hood-like headdress of the time, whereas the other has her face enframed only by her long, freely flowing hair. 72 Cunnington, op. cit., fig. 78c. 73 As seen on the tomb of lohn Main waring at Over Peover (Cheshire) of 1420 or 1455. (An inscription gives the later date (Raymond Richards, Old Cheshire Churches, 1947, p. 270) but the inscription has been questioned. A knight at Elford (Staffordshire), similarly clad, may date from 1474 (Crossley, English Church Monuments, p. 222). Joan Evans, Dress in Medieval France, 1952, pi. 33, illustrates a statue of an armed figure dated "c. 1451" which wears a camail or gorget of mail. More style-conscious persons would have sought to be represented by a figure in "white" (plate) armour at that time. But there are many instances where this was not done, and the simpler protective garb seems for some time to have continued to perpetuate the type which had long since ceased to be fashionable. lohn Hunt, in an unpublished study of armoured figures in Ireland, has amassed much evidence to show that the fourteenth-century type continued long into the sixteenth century, both on effigies and in actual use. One wonders whether James, fifth Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wilthsire, made Lord High Treasurer of England in 1455, was wearing this sensible protection, or was encased in unmanage able plate at the battle of St. Albans. As the Yorkists began to win, as recounted by lohn Lodge, op. cit., IV, p. 15, the Earl fled, "casting his armour into a ditch."</page><page sequence="41">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 87 century, although the particular examples cited are not completely convincing.74 Unmistakably the same kind of sallet as the Jerpoint one, however, though the eye openings are more slanted, is illustrated in a manuscript made in 1501 at Mellifont for the Cistercian abbey of Monasterevan,75 and there are many ex amples of it in a picture attributed to Paolo Uccello (1397-1475) in the National Gallery (Dublin). As to actual examples of the sallet shown at Jerpoint, many of them have been dated to the middle or last part of the fifeenth century,76 a fact which would tend to suggest that they were most common then, and most likely to have wandered far afield from Italy at that time or later. Another suggestion of late date in armour is a hint at striation or ridges in the plate over the thighs in some in stances (particularly the figure on the west side of pier 38). One thinks of tasses. The sculptors liked variety, and have quite consciously varied the details and even the basic garments. This is even more readily explicable if some of the knights may be presumed to stand for persons who had lived previous to the time of the construction of the cloister. The well known Corporation Roll of Water ford of c. 1380 shows persons of importance wearing various kinds of garb, in all likelihood to a large extent the result of the artist's fancy, rather than the outcome of any painstaking sketches made from life of the mayors of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and Limerick. As to weapons, most of the knights of whom fragments are left were armed with a spear, shield, and dagger; in two instances they held a sword. The date of the cloister in its final form would therefore appear to fall within the period from about 1450 to 1525; around 1500, plus or minus a decade or two, seems the best hypothesis. Evidence suggesting this period includes the steeple cap, the Italian-type sallet, the headdress of the lady on pier 3, and the possibilities of influence from art of the Italian Renaissance. The round arch in an arcade is also most probable in the last half of the fifteenth or early sixteenth centuries. Since Jerpoint very possibly served as the model for at least part of the cloister The frescoes in question are those in Padua by Altichiero and Avanzo, dated c. 1384 and c. 1388. One of the salades (sallets) looks like the Jerpoint example, but most of them are not the same type as that under discussion. Rather, they are the usual type of scull, or bascinet, with the neck guard brought forward slightly around the lower part of the cheeks. 75 Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Rawlinson C 32. This manuscript was called to my attention by Dr. Gear6id Mac Niocaill of the National Library, Dublin. 76 Wallace Collection Catalogues: European Arms and Armour, n.d., part I, item number 39 on pi. 2 and pp. 11-12: "Milanese, c. 1440-1445?"

It is considered to be of Milanese workmanship, c. 1470. Although Laking (p. 4) finds that this kind of Italian celata was in use throughout the first half of the fifteenth century, he does not dare to asisgn any of the examples he illustrates to earlier than 1450. Other references nearly always suggest the date of extant examples as late in the fifteenth century.</page><page sequence="42">88 E. C. RAE of Inistioge (almost surely second quarter of the sixteenth century), the former should have been completed by that time.77 Against the suggestion of an earlier date offered at first sight by some of the features of the dress of the ladies and the armour, is the fact that these items persisted later, and that a stylized technique can easily create specious similari ties. Moreover, the Jerpoint artists could have used manuscripts of late thir teenth or early fourteenth-century date for some of their motifs, and could very readily have taken formulae for costumes from the same sources. The almost exclusive use in the cloister of a variation of a thirteenth-century capital coupled with a Romanesque-type base, and the occurrence of ball-flower decoration, which was used on the fourteenth-century window in the presbytery of the abbey church itself, show a readiness to choose from what might be at hand without any feel ing of compulsion to exhibit only the "new" or current. It is also obvious that the artists were not making veristic portraits of particular individuals, and were not concerned with anatomical accuracy. Nothing leads one to expect meticulous exactitude in details of dress and armour. The style of the work at Jerpoint is best described as simple and often un sophisticated. It differs from that of much of the late Gothic sculpture in Ireland, and contrasts particularly with some of the work of the Kilkenny tomb carvers. There is on the abbey piers no tendency toward squat proportions, and little interest on the whole in cascades of drapery, loops, and S-shaped curves. Perhaps one explanation is that Jerpoint is a little earlier than most of the tomb carvings in the area, and used different models, such as late fourteenth and fifteenth century ivories in addition to manuscripts. And the possibility of influence from English alabasters cannot be entirely ruled out,78 although resemblance to them is sometimes far less tenable in comparing the actual objects than when one com pares photographs of them. Furthermore, the work at the abbey cloister is not only on the architectural members but seems to belong there, created by men who were used to cutting blocks of masonry for walls and coulmns, mouldings for doors and windows, rather than by artists who spent most of their time on tomb slabs, metalwork, wood sculpture and the like. 77 As indicated in note 17, the cloister at Inistioge was built by Myles (Milo) Baron, Prior of Inistioge from 1528-1550. (Prior Baron also became Bishop of Ossory in 1528.). There is no difficulty in accepting the pieces of coupled colonnettes with sculptured plates still extant at Inistioge as part of a cloister built between 1528 and the dissolution of Inistioge in 1540. The Jerpoint cloister influenced that at Inistioge, I feel sure. And if the former dates from between 1501 and 1523, which we have suggested as quite possible, then it was built under Abbot Nicholas Baron, who, Carrigan states (op. cit., IV, p. 289), was "probably a relative of Milo Baron, Prior of Inistioge." One wonders whether Canon Carrigan had some evidence for this statement, or was voicing a reason able but unsupported suggestion. Research into the history of the Baron family, or into some documents of the Cistercian order not yet readily available or published, may produce a clear and final answer to the problem of the date of the cloister. 78 For instance, compare the under garb of St. Thomas of Canterbury (Victoria and Albert Museum, English Alabasters from the Hildburg Collection, Ixmdon, 1956, Fig. 23) with that of the abbot of pier 2 (PI. 3 a); or that of St. James Major (PI. 6 b) with the dress of the "weepers" on the tomb of Ralph Green, Lowick (Northants) of c. 1419-1420.</page><page sequence="43">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 89 There are, of course, variations in the style of the sculpture. Two attitudes are present: the one tends toward the abstract, toward pure design, as evidenced by beaming faces which approach the spherical (Pis. 4 b, 9 a, 9 c, 10 b); rather geo metrical draperies (Pis. 4 b, 5 c, 6 a, 6 b); the simple, clean-cut and monumental profile of the bases; and the highly stylized trefoil foliage. In accord with this attitude is the highly linear, rather triangular eye (characteristic also of four teenth-century work) and clearly shown in St. Catherine, the abbot, and the Butler knight (Pis. 3 a, 3 c, 4 a). The second tendency is characterized by a simplification of the naturalistic approach which is commonly seen in the late Gothic of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries everywhere in Europe. At Jerpoint it finds expression in the more literally representational; it seeks varied pose and facial expression, and some times achieves trompe-Voeil detail. Some of the little grotesques and the figures which may symbolize lust and greed are examples (Pis. 7 a, 11 a, 11 b, 11 c). Heavy eyelids surrounding elliptical eyes contribute to a sometimes rather gross aspect. However, the general effect of the Jerpoint figures is one of aliveness. Hands really hold objects, gesture forcefully, cross the body. Hair flies in abandon. Animals squirm and twist, tails wave vigorously, albeit usually in decorative rhythms (Pis. 2, 10 c). Although apparently the work of the stone cutter rather than of the more highly specialized sculptor, in very few instances can the carvings of Jerpoint be described as cold or dead. Variations in the style of drapery are also quite obvious.79 In addition to that which uses flat planes, simple angularity, and the uncomplicated curves of the mouldings (PL 6 a), another manner favours sharp, radiating ridges and a third achieves softer, fuller modelling (PL 6 c), suggesting to some extent what appears to be the earlier work on the mensa tombs in St. Canice's cathedral in Kilkenny, such as the slab now serving for one of the original sides of the tomb of James Schortals. But in view of the scarcity of fixed reference points in Gothic Irish sculpture, it is difficult to make much of these differences, and tenuous hypo theses must be rejected. Only by comparing Jerpoint with other cloisters of the time which employ symbolic or didactic carvings does the excellence of the manuscript-like arrange ment of the Irish version become apparent. A case in point is furnished by the cloister from Trie in southern France of between 1484 and 1490, parts of which are now in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the municipal collections of Tarbes, France, and elsewhere. Here only the capitals are carved, and the fairly naturalistically conceived figures do not fill the areas in a particularly decorative nor architectonic way. The various subjects jostle each other rudely?holy figures, wrestlers, St. Margaret emerging from the dragon, grotesques, the Annunciation, leaves, heads, Resurrection of Lazarus, a spinner. The effect is fragmentary compared to Jerpoint, where the capitals are like the decorative enframements at the top of a page; here carved bits on the arches ?9 The figure on the east face of pier 32 is hardly more than blocked out, though the simple, geometric shape of the feet also occurs in finished alabasters.</page><page sequence="44">90 E. C. RAE vary the rhythm; the stone plates correspond to the principal part of the manu script leaf, with grace notes here and there on the colonnettes; and the bases seem to form a footnote commentary and additional enframement. CONCLUSION On many a cloister throughout Ireland appear an isolated saint or two, an abbot, a coat of arms, a head, a scrap of foliage or a bit of interlace?a pleasant interlude in a serried row of piers. And on the "surrounds" (side pieces) of the late Gothic tombs of Leinster and Munster are often apostles and other saints, frequently a crucifix, sometimes a few scenes from the Passion. The meaning and purpose of such carved work are abundantly clear. But, as far as we know, not since the creation of the facade of the old cathedral church at Ardmore (Waterford) at the end of the twelfth century had there been in this land any single architectural ensemble of figures which approaches the richness of the spectacle at Jerpoint. Only Christ Church in Dublin and Cashel Cathedral offer anything comparable in extent, and with them it is a matter of capitals, label stops, and other such details. What is the purpose and meaning of the sculptures of the cloister at Jerpoint? Why are there so many lay figures, so many animals? One recalls late Gothic tombs in England and elsewhere where the "weepers" are sometimes relatives of the deceased, and many a chantry chapel comes to mind, culminating in the Tudor mausoleum (chapel of Henry VII) at Westmin ster. An explanation of the wealth of carving at the cloister may begin to take form if we consider seriously the wording of a bequest to Jerpoint made in 1451 by one Robert Folyng "for his soul, that of his wife Johanne Bross', and for the soul of James Butler, Earl of Ormond, and of their ancestors."80 Such a pious pronouncement is not in the slightest unusual. But what is indeed unusual is the possibility that some of the beneficiaries and benefactors have been given plastic form on the piers of the cloister arcade. How else to account for the six, or possibly nine knights still extant, one of them indubitably a Butler, and another perhaps a Walsh?81 In addition, there are the sculptured figures of at least one other important layman and two or three lay women. Perhaps other donors were similarly honored by figures which stood for them or for their ancestors.82 One recalls the series of gisants of early bishops created for propa 80 Carrigan, op. cit., IV, p. 152. 81 In the abbey church are inscribed tombs of members of the Walsh family, one dated 1476, another 1501. Possibly one reason for inconsistencies in the costumes of some of the figures is that they may be meant to represent ancestors. Compare, for instance, with the gay melange of dress and armour which presents itself in the Historia et Genealogia Familiae de Burgo of the year 1578 (Trinity College, Dublin, MS F.4.13). Martin J. Blake reproduces some of the illustrations in the /. Galway Arch. &amp; Hist. Soc, VII, $2, 1911, pp. 95 ff. 82 On the cloister from Trie are at least ten different coats of arms which appear authentic and serious in intent rather than playful or merely decorative. They perpetuate "the names of local families" according to lames I. Rorimer, The Cloisters, second ed., New York, 1951, p. 86. The families so honoured were probably donors of one kind or another.</page><page sequence="45">SCULPTURE IN JERPOINT CLOISTER 91 ganda purposes at Wells sometime near the year 1200; the expressive group of founders in the choir of the cathedral of Naumburg, carved about 1260, long after their death; commemorative effigies such as the gisants created about the same time, at least fourteen of which still exist in the abbey church of St. Denis, near Paris; and the striking enfilade of notable persons in the court church at Inns bruck created for the Emperor Maximilian in the sixteenth century. The cloister thus takes on the aspect of an extensive memorial, more inclusive than the most elaborate of insular mensa tombs. Revered ancestors and relations, perhaps some of them still alive, mingle with the apostles who will assist at the Day of Judgment and with other saints. There may have been a Crucifixion group, Mary and John on the piers and Christ upon a cross nearby. But this is by no means all. Into the ensemble were interpolated all sorts of interesting things, instructive, moralizing, wondrous, entertaining, frightening. The whole suggests that encyclopaedic point of view which had found such telling ex pression in the great thirteenth-century portals of French cathedrals, had con tinued to prosper in the pages of the manuscript, and finally achieved monumental form in Gothic Ireland in the cloister of the Cistercian abbey at Jerpoint.</page></plain_text>
