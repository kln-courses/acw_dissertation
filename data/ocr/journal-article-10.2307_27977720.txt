<plain_text><page sequence="1">79 NOTES ON SOME STONE SCULPTURE PROM THE NORTHERN LAKE TITICACA BASIN Sergio Jorge Chavez Stone sculpture from the altiplano of Puno has attracted the attention of explorers and archaeologists over the years, leading to the discovery and study of many new pieces, especially ones in the Pucar? style and other styles related to it. With very few exceptions, however, these monuments lack archaeological context. Most of them have been found on the surface and/or moved from their original locations, and most are worn, broken, or defaced in different degrees. In addition, insufficient .information in the literature has hindered or delayed access to many of these important remains. Some pieces of sculpture have been poorly illustrated, and others are as yet unpublished.-' With these difficulties in mind, I should like to provide new information on some stone sculpture from the northern Lake Titicaca Basin. Anthropomorphic Statue from Japisi Luring an archaeological reconnaissance in Arapa in August, 1974, we were informed that a statue had been brought to the Casa del Concejo at Villa Betanzos, a small village 3?5 km. southwest of Ampa (fig. 1). Arriving at Villa Betanzos, we interviewed the local politi cal authority, Mr. Valeriano Gonzales, who in turn showed us the statue. Inquiring about the original location of the statue, we learned that it had been dug up in 1973 near a chapel in Japisi (Parcialidad de Japisi, located roughly 4?5 km? southeast of Villa Betanzos). After a heavy rain some residents of Japisi noted that the top of the statue1s head was showing. They proceeded to uncover the statue and found it buried vertically. Two stone mortars were also recovered nearby (fig. 1a), but as they were found close to the surface, their association with the statue is not clear. After being informed about the discovery, Mr. Gonzales ordered the statue to be brought to the Concejo at Villa Betanzos for safe keeping. The personage represented appears to be standing, although the shallow horizontal groove at the back of the legs may indicate a slight ly squatting position. The breechclout is unusual because it lacks the characteristic side flaps. It has four incised subrectangular conven tionalized faces.2 The short legs are depicted with an incised oval at both knees; this motif at the knee joints is a characteristic so far re corded only on Pucar? pottery. However, the figure on the slab from Moho, described below, has conventionalized face motifs located at the shoulder, elbow, and knee joints. On the Japisi statue, two incised horizontal parallel lines encircle the ankles, and round reliefs indi cate ankle bones. The feet, which have five toes, rest directly on a rectangular platform or pedestal. The two arms are bent at the elbows and the hands rest on the chest. The hands are holding one or two rounded objects with a deep and</page><page sequence="2">80 wide groove in the middle; identification of the object(s) is difficult because it is broken. There is a wide, flaring collar on the chest.3 The wrists have a simple incised wristband, and there is an incised S shaped element on the side of each upper arm. On the back both scapulas are represented in relief. The facial shape, the eyes, and the mouth are rendered in the usual Pucar? manner. The mouth is closed. The nose has been broken as in most Pucar? style statues and statuettes. The hair or cap which ex tends under the headband and fi?mes the face is also present on other Pucar? statues. The ears stand out and face forward as on two small statues without specific provenience,4 rather than lying flat against the head.5 There is a horizontal incision within a semicircular zone on the ear, as on a Pucar? style head in the Pucar? Museum. The statue from Japisi has an ornate headdress sculptured in the round. There is a headband with oblique incised lines and an animal head with its mouth facing upwards on the front. Above the headband, two rounded appendages with curved incised lines project upward and slightly sideways at the sides. A set of three "feathers" rises from a rectangular base in the middle of the headdress.7 The importance of this piece lies in its relatively good state of preservation. The statue from Japisi allows us to document the asso ciation of elements on a complete piece of sculpture, thus enriching our knowledge of Pucar? iconography. Slab from Moho This slab (fig. 2), showing a "dismembered" human figure in profile, is presently housed at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, and was illustrated in 1943 by Kidder for the first and only time.8 The museum catalog card has the following description: "Catalogue # 8659? Portal of Guaca st one near Moho. Lake Titicaca. Peru. Collected 1875 by S.W. Garman. October 1875?" Furthermore, Kidder indicated that the slab, other collections, and notes which were never published were presented by Alexander Agassiz to the Peabody Museum.9 During two visits to the Peabody Museum in 1979 and 1981 we made a rubbing of the Moho slab (fig. 2b) and photographed, measured, and took notes on it. After comparing our illustrations with that pub lished by Kidder, we observed several significant details, which add to the documentation of this important piece. First, the photograph published by Kidder was printed in re verse; that is, the personage portrayed should be facing to the left instead of to the right. Second, the foot has what appear to be two straps of a sandal, a new element in the iconography of the region, and a small excised ol?v ele at the position of the ankle bone. The "sandal" cannot be seen in Kidder1s photograph; only two horizontal incisions, one at the ankle and</page><page sequence="3">81 one at the "base of the toes, are visible and likely represent additional sandal straps.10 Third, the circle at the knee joint is actually a variation of the two circular face motifs present at the elbow and shoulder joints. The face at the knee is smaller and has no visible mouth.^ Fourth, at the upper portion of the leg, there is a small horizontal incision, again not reported or visible in Kidder1s photograph* Fifth, while Kidderfs photograph shows the wristband with only two oblique incised lines, in actuality the wristband consists of a zig zag incision foming opposing triangles. It may also be noted that the fingers and toes vary progressively in length, probably in an attempt to represent them more realistically. Furthermore, the protuberance seen on the hand at the beginning of the wrist and at what would be the base of the little finger, may represent the heel of the upturned hand. Sixth, the adornment at the top and back of the head which ex tends forward, ends at the front in a circular incision with a circular depression in the center. The radiating incised lines on this adornment are reminiscent of those on Pucar? related head ornaments.^ The information noted here adds to the observations made ear lier by Kidder: the reuse of this slab in a chullpa structure of a much later date, its stylistic relation to some Pucar? and some Tiahuanaco iconography, and its unusual depiction in low relief of a human figure with "dismembered" head, arm, and leg in profile.13 Anthropomorphic Statue from Mallaccasi This statue (along with a stela) was documented for the first and only time by Kidder on August 18, 1941? It was broken in three parts, with feet and waist portions missing (fig. 3)? Kidder set it apart stylistically from other standing human representations in the area.14 My intention in including this statue here is to point out two important characteristics of this piece, the positioning of the right hand and the depiction of male genitalia. Neither of these attributes escaped Kidder1s keen observation. However, the photograph he included in the 1943 report does not do justice to his description. Around 1957, Dr. Manuel Chavez Ballon and I revisited the site of Mallaccasi; at that time additional photographs were taken of the statue reported by Kidder.15 One of these photographs (fig. 3a) clearly shows the right hand with five fingers resting just above the stomach in higher relief than appears in Kidder1s photograph.16 The position of the right hand, pointing upwards, has a long tradition in the Lake Titicaca Basin.17 The left hand was on the waist portion of the statue, which is missing. The Mallaccasi statue has the male genitalia explicitly poip trayed, and the broken penis seems to have been erect, as suggested by</page><page sequence="4">82 the smaller remaining portion. Although this representation of male gen italia is the only one so far known in the northern Titicaca Basin, there are, according to Bennett and others, two statues from Tiahuanaco also showing male genitalia. 18 On August 5&gt; I97O, I discovered that the statue had suffered an additional alteration, which deserves to be documented here. During a visit to the village of Pucar?, I had the opportunity of meeting the local elementary school teacher who was well known for his interest and efforts in providing the school with a collection of prehistoric arti facts to be used as visual teaching aids. Among the collections he showed me (mainly Collao-related pottery vessels), I recognized a stone fragment of an entire hand, which I immediately suspected was part of the Mallaccasi statue. By inquiring further, I learned that my suspi cion was correct. A few years ago the professor had organized a student field trip to visit and collect archaeological remains from Mallaccasi. During this trip they located the statue and wanted to bring it back to the school. However, as the fragments of the statue were too heavy to be transported, they removed the hand instead and brought it back to the school. In this case, then, a statue was defaced, not by extirpators of idolatries in centuries past, but by a twentiety-century school teacher. As stated by Kidder, the importance of this statue lies in the fact that it is different from known Pucar? and Tiahuanaco statues*19 This statue does not compare well to pieces belonging to the Taya-Mama style either.20 While this statue might be late in time, as Kidder pro posed, there is also the possibility that it may belong to an earlier local style.21 Juan C. Darfs Report A short report was made by Juan C. Dar in 1923 on the discovery of a stone carving in the vicinity of Pucar?.22 This report is signifi cant for three reasons: first, it predates the pioneer archaeological efforts in the area of Yalc?rcel, Tello, and Kidder. Second, the iconog^ raphy reported for this stone carving does not appear to conform to the known styles of the area* Third, no archaeologist or explorer in the area has located the piece since its first description* Its rediscovery and proper documentation are still possible. The report misleadingly suggests that the stone carving was found at Pucar?, but the location given is ten leagues by railroad from the city of Puno. A league can range from 2*4 miles (or 3?86 km.) to 4.6 miles (or 7*40 km*), the English league being about 3 miles (or 4?83 km*).23 The distance from Puno would then range from 38*6 km* to 74?0 km*, placing the location of the piece between about Caraco to and north of Calapujaf or using the English league, at 48*3 km* in the vicinity of Juliaca. This range is situated some distance southeast of Pucar?* The entire reference is reproduced here in a translation by John H* Rowe:</page><page sequence="5">83 STONE CARVING POUND AT PUCARA In one of the student excursions made "by teacher Torres of Public School no? 87O8 of Pucar?, he was lucky enough to discover a stone carving 3 nu long, 1*05 m. wide in the upper part and 88 cm* in the lower* Its front part represents a human figure ornamented with symbolic engravings* In its upper part there are four human faces which have their heads covered with a cap which ends in a sort of spiral shell; in the lower part, there are four other faces of the same kind; these are located in the angles* On the back part there are engravings, signs which resem ble hieroglyphs* The place where the stone carving was discov ered is located 10 leagues by railroad from the city of Puno* - June, 1923 - Juan C.

This collar closely resembles that on the statue known as the "personaje m?tico" (Valc?rcel, 1932, pp. 19 and 23)? However, the collar on the "personaje m?tico," unlike the one on the Japisi statue, extends over the shoulders. Similar collars also occur on Pucar? Poly chrome pottery (see the "running angels" in Rowe and Brandel, 1971* fig* 4). ^Kidder, 1943, 1? VI, figs. 3, 4? See also the "Flute Player" from Pokotia, Bolivia (Posnansky, 1945, vol. II, fig. 96J Bajocco, 1965. P. 23). 5Valcarcel, 1932, pp. 19 and 23? 6Rowe, 1977, figs. 13, 14? 7 This headdress may be compared to that on one of the faces of a broken stela from Q?,luyu (see Rowe, 1977, ? 12, fig. 11). Furthermore, the incisions on the two rounded appendages at both sides of the head dress might represent the wide and thick lips of a mythical creature (e.g., Rowe and Brandel, 1971, figs. 37, 74), also seen, for example, on some of the headdresses of the "running angels" of the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco (see Posnansky, 1945, vol. I, pl. XLIII, fig. 2). A variation of an ornate headdress can be seen on a statuette illustrated by Rowe, 1974, Abb* 364, and by Eisleb and Strelow, 1980, Abb* 2. 8Kidder 1943, PP* 18, 36, 48, pi* V, fig. 11. This slab was classi fied by Kidder as belonging to Group IV, slabs with relief caxving} its iconography was compared to that of stone and pottery of the region for the first time. 9 Kidder, 1943, ? 18, footnote 9? The notes prepared by Alexander Agassi in galley proof for the 1876-77 Annual Report of the Peabody Museum, indicate that an extensive collection of artifacts was made by Garman and Agassi himself: One set of specimens came from the vicinity of Lima (Ancon, Chancay and Callao), another collection from Arica and Pisagua, a third from Pacasmaya [sic] in northern Peru, giving a fair representation of the archaeology of the coast, while the col lections made around Lake Titicaca, at the height of 1800 ft. [sic] above the level of the sea, at Moho, Vilquechico, Guaichu, Tiahuanaco, the islands of Titicaca and Coati, as well as frag ments collected at different points, illustrate the antiquities of the high Plateau of the Andes in which Lake Titicaca is</page><page sequence="7">85 placed (Agassiz, ms., * 1). Regarding the location of the slab from Moho, Agassiz noted that: At Moho the guacas [chullpas] ? * . examined were situat ed at the head of the Gulf of Moho, to the left of the road leading from the Bay to the Town. These towers differ from those of Yilquechico, they are not cylindrical but slightly constricted in the middle and the chambers at the base of the towers opened directly outward so that their contents can be examined without pulling down the monuments. They were closed by slabs of stone, and on one of these doors was the rude relief of a human figure. The figure is not complete, only the head, headdress, left arm and hand, and the left leg and foot were cut in profile (Agassiz, ms., p* l). ^Assuming a sandal is portrayed, its form is unlike any documented in Mejia Xesspe (1979)? It is possiblef however, that these strap marks were added later. 11 Compare these incised conventionalized faces with those present on the breechclout of the Japisi statue described above, and see note 2* 12 See Chavez and Chavez, 1970, ? 38, illustration of the statuette from the Field Museum of Natural History. 13 ^Kidder* 1943, ? 18, 36. The "arrow" and "tail" motif around the eye, however* approximates more closely those on Pucar? Polychrome pottery than Tiahuanaco ones (e.g., Rowe and Brandel, 1971, figs* 4, 5)? Similarly, the depiction of disarticulated head, arm, and leg is also more prevalent in Pucar? ceramic iconography. Por all these attributes in Pucar?, see also Rowe and Brandel, 1971, figs. 21, 24. John . Rowe (personal communication) has noted that while the Moho figure consists of segments, these segments are nevertheless in anatomical alignment} he has suggested that the missing body may have originally been painted in to complete the figure* 14Kidder, 1943, pl. "VII, figs. 2-4, pp. 21, 27, 31, and 48. This statue was classified by Kidder as belonging to Group la, standing human figure statues. 15 / ^Another visit to the site was made by the author and Karen Chavez in 1967, when an additional anthropomorphic statue was documented (Chavez and Chavez, 1970, p* 37)* l6Compare Kidder, 1943, pi* VII, fig* 2? ^See. for example, Chavez and Chavez, 1976, figs. 2, 3} Lyon. 1979, fig* 10} Portugal, 1941, upper photo on p. 295* 18Bennett (1934, PP* 462, 467-468, 474) included two statues (Nos. 22 and 23) with male genitalia under his Style 3, Squared Pillar Type Statues, and belonging to his Group III, Technically Decadent Pillar like Statues and Heads, characterized by "Simplicity, angularity, and mediocrity..*" (pp. 467 and 474)* Posnansky (1945, vol.

Lyon (1979, footnote 47) noted the absence of representations of male or female genitals in the Pucar? style* It can be added here that such explicit representa tions are also absent in the Taya-Mama and Tiahuanaco styles. 19 yThe appearance of being crudely executed which Kidder noted may be the result of intentional battering and/or weathering, however. 20 See Chavez and Chavez, 1976. 21 Kidder, 1943? ? 21, 27? Kidder also reported an eroded and/or battered stela found near this statue (Kidder, 1943, 1? VII, figs. 6, 7, pp. 21, 27, 31, 48), and suggested that the stela was also stylistically different from Pucar? and late* 22 Dar, I923, ? 557?
