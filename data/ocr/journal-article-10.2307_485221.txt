<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Production of History in Kenya: The Mau Mau Debate E. S. Atieno-Odhiambo Introduction: The i98os Debate For four decades, Mau Mau has been the conjuncture around which Kenya's pasts and Kenya's possible futures have been debated, contested and fought over. These pasts and futures have pitted brother against brother as the two traditions of loyal- ism and resistance have continued to divide Agikuyu households (nyumba) and agemates (riika); junior and older age-grades within the same ridge (Ogot 1972) and geographical regions - Nyeri "patriotism" versus Kiambu "softness," for example. At the professional level, the calls for "radical" versus "bourgeois" inter- pretations of Mau Mau and of Kenya's history by the Kenyans themselves took their most acute forms at two annual meetings of the Historical Association of Kenya in Nairobi. At the first, in 1981, in his Presidential Address B. A. Ogot roundly chastized the radicals Maina wa Kinyatti, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Mukaru Ng'ang'a. He pointedly criticized them for not being rigorous enough in their application of Marxist methodology to the study of Mau Mau. Ogot was more generous to two budding political scientists trained at Princeton and Chi- cago, Apollo Njonjo and Peter Anyang'-Nyong'o, respectively, for fulfilling the canons of Marxist enquiry. The mastery of the latter had led them into a recogni- tion that Gikuyu and Kenyan societies had been steeply differentiated as a conse- quence of the uneven penetration of capitalism in the countryside in the inter-war years, an unevenness which in turn demarcated the opportunities and frontiers of accumulation available to the rural Africans. These conclusions, Ogot averred, should therefore have informed the likes of Maina wa Kinyatti against making glib blanket claims about traitors and freedom fighters (Ogot 1981). This confrontation was the beginning of another round of the Mau Mau debate, an intellectual endeavour launched forty years earlier by Louis Leakey as Lonsdale and Berman have argued in a recent paper (Lonsdale and Berman 1990o). The generations of interpretations that have followed (Buijtentuijs 1973, 1982) are part of an intellectual entrepreneurship that has been referred to by one transnational round table of historians and anthropologists as the production of history, an expression which is intended to encompass ... not only conventions and paradigms, in the formation of historical knowledge and historical texts, but also - among other things - the forces underlying interpretation 300</page><page sequence="2">301 Atieno-Odhiambo: History in Kenya: The Mau Mau Debate and the contentions, emotions, and struggles which evoke and produce historical lit- erature (Cohen and Atieno-Odhiambo 1992). One aspect of this formulation deals with the question of Mau Mau as property - intellectual, social, sectarian, and national. On this vein, David William Cohen has elsewhere written: In Kenya, the debates over the meaning and proprietorship of the Mau Mau history continue at present into their "nth" phase. Was the Mau Mau experience an insur- gency or a peasant revolution? Did it fail or succeed? What happened to its actors, apostles and spokesmen? Was it an authentic expression of nationalism and thus the property of all Kenyans, or a distinctive expression of the landless and powerless? Was it a Kikuyu rising or the rising of a particular section of Kikuyu society? Since the midst of the Mau Mau experience of the 1950s, what Mau Mau was, what it means, how it was individually and collectively experienced, whether its ideals and objectives were abandoned or carried on, and by whom for what ends, have been the most cap- tivating questions in Kenyan political life, theater, and literature (Cohen 1986, 48). The immediacy and poignancy of these questions became clear at the January 1986 meeting of the Historical Association of Kenya, a gathering marked by sub- jectivism on all sides, not least on my own part. The nature of my subjectivism was very much determined by the factors of event, contingency and professionalism. That early January meeting was an historical event in Kenya throughout most of 1986 for the professional or guild historian, for the newspapers and broadcast media, and for the general public. The meeting triggered off a Mau Mau debate, encompassing all layers of Kenyan society, from President Moi to the former Mau Mau, and down to ordinary cultivators in the shambas in Dundori, Nakuru dis- trict. It provoked the Mau Mau to regroup in their various fractions in Nyeri and in Nakuru and raised questions of alliances for the incumbent members of parlia- ment from Gikuyuland. The contingency is that I happened to have been chairing the particular session from which the debate sparked, and so can bear witness to it inauspicious beginnings. It all started with a typewritten paper from John Lons- dale, the key sentence from which read: "However one approaches the subject, Mau Mau is an embarrassment." Kenya's intellectual gadfly William Ochieng', who once labelled the nineteenth century missionary and explorer David Living- stone as a "hippy and a spy," caught onto that crucial sentence as soon as it dropped from the lips of David Throup, the presenter. At question time, Ochieng' pitched in: "Yes, Mau Mau is an embarrassment to all of us," he said, particularly because the Agikuyu elites want to appropriate it as an exclusively Gikuyu move- ment, so as to exclude every other Kenyan individual and nationality from the fruits of independence, matunda ya Uhzuru, which in their opinion must be har- vested and eaten by the Agikuyu exclusively. A clear enough exposition. But the journalists chose the punch line: "'Mau</page><page sequence="3">302 CJAS / RCEA 25:2 1991 Mau is an embarrassment' says Professor Ochieng"' blazoned the headlines of the following day. That line, in the following months, resonated in the various discourses as Mau Mau veterans, politicians, patriots and the President of the Republic took up the debate on public platforms. Not once was the statement attributed to its actual author, John Lonsdale. Not once was Bill Ochieng's' full sentence reproduced. But he was castigated by all and sundry. The Mau Mau vet- erans convened their own Conference in Nyeri in February, where they dubbed the now very subdued and muted Ochieng' as an ignorant youth, and where they resolved to write their own "truth" about Mau Mau. The tentative reflections of the Cambridge don (Lonsdale), presumably scribbled in the gas-lit chambers of Trinity College, Cambridge, found a reverberating echo on the foothills facing Mount Kenya. By profession I am an historian, a student of twentieth century Kenya, origi- nally trained in archival history, but whose focus has been on ordinary people, peasants in their rural and urban contexts. My intellectual contacts with the issue at hand, namely Mau Mau, spring from my intellectual interest in the question of nationalism in Kenya; a spell of three months' study of the secondary materials and original collections on Mau Mau at Stanford University in 1979-80; and my teaching a History of Political Ideas course at The Johns Hopkins University in the Fall 1985 semester on the novels of Ngugi wa Thiong'o, with a focus on Ngugi's Sense ofHistory. I have had my detractor in Maina wa Kinyatti, who labelled me as "an anti-Mau Mau intellectual" in his Thunderfrom the Mountains (1980) and who fulminated against two papers: "Who were the Mau Mau?" and "The Interna- tional Press and the Mau Mau," which I had presented at the Annual Conference of the Kenya Historical Association in 1981. I have also, by innuendo and associa- tion, been accused by Robert Buijtenhuijs in his Mau Mau Twenty Years After (1973) of refusing to confront and study Mau Mau because the Nairobi historians from western Kenya - he meant to say "Luo and Abaluyia" - have deliberately turned their focus away from Mau Mau, thereby relegating it to a secondary event in Kenya's history. I happen to be a Luo. So, right from the start I enter into the scenario with cultural baggage (I am Luo), a tainted nonactivist record (I am anti- Mau Mau) and a situational drawback (I am generationally younger than the Mau Mau experience, and so could not have fought in it). Whose History? Mau Mau: war / rebellion / civil war / revolution? Each choice of epithet both absolves and accuses the users irrespective of whether they claim the expertise of professional or guild historians or partake in the popular debate of the various interested parties. The point is that there are layers of spoken knowledge, but also of critical silences, that inform one's choice of each word both within the academy and in the larger society. This is because there are, in fact, various Mau Mau pasts calling for their own historians. These include the pasts of the Home Guards, of the Gikuyu students of the day, of the Mau Mau, of the British soldiers engaged in</page><page sequence="4">303 Atieno-Odhiambo: History in Kenya: The Mau Mau Debate the war against the Mau Mau. The world revealed in the papers of General Erskine, for a time the local Commander-in-Chief, is very different from the world of the Mau Mau orator Dedan Kimathi. It is a world very different from that of Muriu, the Home Guard Askariwho shot Kimathi. And yet, it is the same imperial world, the same imperial past. The Suppression of the Past But, it will be argued, it is task of historians to write history; and indeed there is only one history, that penned by the academic. The contention that academic his- tory may not be the real and only history is well taken. The challenge to the Kenyan historians of Mau Mau lies precisely here. For many of the debaters assumed that Professor Ochieng', the guild historian, was the one who knew least amongst the current protagonists. The "reasons" for this ignorance are varied. The letters to the editor pages in the Nairobi English language newspapers, The Daily Nation and The Standard, variously suggested that he was ignorant because he was a guild his- torian (and therefore living in an ivory tower), because he is a Luo (and therefore incapable of understanding a non-Luo event), or, frequently, because he was naive. But the more serious charge ran that he knew but was suppressing truth, another milestone in the suppression of the past. Bill Ochieng' may well have been suppressing the past, but the British were the first to do this. Mau Mau was a secu- rity matter to the British, so it was initially a Kenya police problem, then a Colonial Office affair, then a military problem for the British Army. As it wore on, the British also decided that it was an operation best kept secret from the humanitarian and Labor Party pro-Mau Mau lobbies in Britain. Closer to home in Kenya, the British also decided that the activities of their local allies, the over Ioo oo Gikuyu Home Guards, should also remain a secret. The British wrote secret histories of this Guard, among which were the "Secret History of Kiambu Home Guard," "Secret History of Fort Hall Home Guard," and the "Secret History of the Nyeri Loyal- ists." The utility of this position was clear: the British chose to protect their allies. And then Jomo Kenyatta came out of detention in 1961, with messages of rec- onciliation to his Gikuyu and his Kenyan communities. "Forgive and forget the past," he told the European settlers. "We all fought for Uhuru," he told his Afri- can-Kenyan wide audience repeatedly. The Home Guards had a real vested inter- est in this message: the past that was to be forgotten / suppressed included their past vicious activities. Because many of them were also occupying senior positions in Kenyatta's government, the ex-loyalists managed to reiterate this message vig- orously. Over the years, then, those who have sought, in Gikuyu society, to raise issues pertaining to the Mau Mau fighters' arguments have had the regular reminder that they are seeking to destabilize society by "opening old wounds." Their very motives have been questioned: they are andu a muthotho (gossips) (Ng'ang'a 1977). It has been the corporate endeavour of the state and the Gikuyu community to suppress this past, a significant slice of the total Mau Mau experi- ence.</page><page sequence="5">304 CJAS / RCEA 25:2 1991 In spite of this suppression of half the story, the history of Mau Mau, being so evocative, is often discussed in public in high enough decibels to be shouted. It is shouted as something we all know about. It is hurled at the audience as "the public knowledge of the past." The debate has many faces. One face assumes that the facts about Mau Mau are well-known, and are simultaneously self-validating. The task of the guild historian, according to that section of the public that frequently calls on us to write, is one of providing "instant interpretation." Thus, the ques- tioner / debater starts with a prologue informed by "knowledge," makes a case and raises the rhetorical question "why are you historians saying / not saying these things?" I confess that the guild historians themselves raised the pitch as well, for they were also discussing Mau Mau through the use of the semantics that the humanities and social sciences deployed in the 196os and 1970s. Was it a national- ist movement? Was it a tribal civil war, or was it, rather, a revolution? In doing this, they were calling for a baptismal name for a movement they had only heard of but not yet studied. The second phase in this suppression of the past is the converse of this and sug- gests that Mau Mau is very important. We do not know enough about it yet. There- fore, we must research and preserve our findings very carefully. But who is to do the research? The guild historians, say the professionals. No, say the Mau Mau generals. Only those who participated, who know Mau Mau, can undertake research on it. Over the last five years, Mau Mau generals have set up two research phalanxes from amongst themselves. The first research team was led by Field Marshall Mbaria Kaniu and politician Waruru Kanja (with a two million shilling public gift from President Moi). It promised to document, write plays and make movies about Mau Mau. The second phalanx met in Nyeri in February of 1986 and, while denouncing Kaniu's group as ignorant (one does not know by what cri- teria), said it would undertake the same activities. Whatever their rancorous con- tentions, these generals were speaking to the agenda of "our story." Whatever else "their story" may be, these are powerful statements of expertise and powerful statements of emotion. They do raise the further question as to who needs the Mau Mau story. Ironically, not everybody else does. The Home Guards do not need a Mau Mau story. The possible consumers of a Mau Mau story end up being various other ele- ments in society, such as, for example, guild historians, nationalist agitators like Maina wa Kinyatti, who sees in Mau Mau "the highest peak of Kenyan national- ism" (Kinyatti 1977). Others might be opportunistic Mau Mau generals like Kas- sam Njogu and ex-Mau Mau sans culottes (Komnerera) like Kariuki Chotara, who have wanted a bigger share of the national cake and who argue that "this is the cen- tral event which should not be forgotten." Still others might include even landless and forlorn Mau Mau ex-ranks like General Kahonoki and his Nakuru Ex-Free- dom Fighters Organization (NDEFFO), whose continuous cry to both society and state has been that "we have been forgotten." Society needs this story, but it is society that must be disaggregated before we can identify the various consumer</page><page sequence="6">305 Atieno-Odhiambo: History in Kenya: The Mau Mau Debate components. One begins to see society as a dynamic whole, its civil components consisting of novelists, dramatists, preachers, painters, literary critics, or social sci- entists. Of particular relevance to the Kenyan case are the historians and the novel- ists and literary publicists like Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Micere Mugo, authors of The Trial ofDedan Kimathi (1976). That all these literati assumed that there is an audience out there awaiting them attests, in Cohen's words, to the "incomplete dialectics of the collective experience." Truly, nobody knows it all, nor do the audiences expect to hear it all from one source. There would be no point to the story if it were uniform. The audience must be captive at two levels. The first level relates to commu- nication, and involves both the translation of Mau texts and the manipulation of its symbols. The Mau Mau message is an appeal to the physical space - "our land" - and to the physical state of things - "we, the landless." The message thus relays the Mau Mau conception of the nature of reality. The manipulation to good effect of core Mau Mau symbols like the oath, the beard and the deadlocks is an ongoing enterprise in Kenya. The beard is at once a symbol of long suffering (Kenyatta's), of heroism (Kimathi's), or of sedition (by university lecturers, according to Presi- dent Moi and by primary school teachers, according to Kiambu Disrict Commis- sioner Fred McMwango). The second level relates to power: the audience that needs the Mau Mau mes- sage is an audience in search of power. The history of the Mau Mau is the history of power, how it is attained, or lost, manipulated, controlled. It is a confession that society is still engaged in struggle about power and struggle for accountability as well. The narration of the history of Mau Mau is an accounting process with its profits and losses, and yes, scores to be settled. This accounting needs a language, a metaphor; not just one metaphor, but many, because there are several audiences out there to be addressed and captured. They are best addressed in the context of culture; in the context ofAgikuyu cul- ture; more succinctly, in the context of Agikuyu history. The Production of Gikuyu History The production of history of the Agikuyu has been an anthropomorphic endeavour in the last one hundred years. The mountain, Mount Kenya, Kiri- nyaga, to the Agikuyu, looms large at the back of the minds of the moulders of Gikuyu history. Kenyatta and Ngugi wa Thiong'o represent the two main tenden- cies in this exercise: Kenyatta as the archetypal patriarch, who embodied the wis- dom of Gikuyu society, and the novelist Ngugi as the Trotsky of Gikuyu national- ism. Occupying a middle and less prominent zone is the guild historian, Godfrey Muriuki, whose History of the Kikuyu (1974) has generated less primordial emotion than Kenyatta's Facing Mount Kenya and less youthful passion than Ngugi's Petals ofBlood (1977). Kenyatta's legacy to the process was long-term. He spoke first, and then lived long. One of the consequences of his longevity is that he put a lid on indigenous Gikuyu production of history, folklore and anthropology. For fifty</page><page sequence="7">306 CJAS / RCEA 25:2 1991 years, until his death in 1978, he was the authority, the enigma and the riddle. He was Muthee, the Elder, and valorized therefore the hold of the elders on society from time to time. Through the manipulation of the symbol of the oath, he called the Gikuyu nation to order internally and to ranks against their presumed external Luo enemies. One of the agendas for future research has to do with getting Kenyatta's own sense of history in the period of his Presidency between 1963 and 1978 (Atieno-Odhiambo I99I). He did not say it much, openly, but did the man evaluate his own vocation as a fulfillment of a historical mission originally evoked by himself? We could argue like John Lonsdale that Kenyatta gave the Agikuyu a sense of high politics, the politics of the state. But the social processes of change under- mined the basis of the deep politics of the clan. One of the remarkable features of Gikuyu society has to do with the fact that the Gikuyu students in the undergradu- ate history class in Nairobi in 1984-85 had no idea of the meaning of the clan in Gikuyu society. When asked to write a term paper on the history of their clans, these neophytes all echoed the founding charter from Kenyatta: Gikuyu society was founded by the eponymous patriarch Gikuyu, his wife Mumbi and their nine daughters. From then the neophytes made a qualitative leap and wrote their shal- low lineage (mbari) history, stretching back to the great-grandfather. The message was instructive. Here is a whole cohort whose sense of history amounts to the twentieth century, growing up amongst a people widely reputed for having a deep sense of history. The narrative becomes more interesting when it is recalled that even the path-breaking Facing Mount Kenya (1938) has its most frequent, and per- haps its only, regular public application in settling of divorce cases contracted under African customary law in the statutory courts of Kenya. Clearly, the reso- nance is there: property relations are the currently enduring reality in Gikuyu countryside, all the others have been torn asunder. So, we have "surface history" for this most historical of nationalities. An understanding of the above paradox gives context as to why Muriuki's aca- demic input arouses no agitation for or against, because it deals with a safe past, the nineteenth century and before. And it gives context to why Ngugi's sense of history, anchored in the twentieth century, with its overheads of sense of wrong and right, would sit ill at ease with the present generation of Gikuyu elders. This generation has "agreed to agree" on the dangers of raking up surface history for study: the worms may still be turning on the putrefying corpses of our murdered or betrayed fathers. Deciphering a "sense of the past" from the "forty generation" (Anake a Forty) may well nigh be impossible because of its vested interest in the suppression of the past. Evidently, there are discrete interests in these generations of Gikuyu society. What is more, for the Agikuyu, because of Mau Mau, recalling history is in part about defining commitments, refining one's conflicts of interests, confronting one's share of responsibility in the making and re-making ofpost-Mau Mau society. Human beings all over the world postpone these moments of defini- tion of commitment as long as possible. One of the exit routes out of this dilemma</page><page sequence="8">307 Atieno-Odhiambo: History in Kenya: The Mau Mau Debate is to cast a network of discrete belongings and emphasize the least intimate of them. Kenyatta and the two Gikuyu Vice Presidents after him (before they were relegated to the temporary dustbins of history), Mwai Kibaki and Dr. Josephat Karanja, have seen the need to emphasize that they are Kenyan leaders, particu- larly at those moments when the Agikuyu have closed in on them, pushing them to give account to their base clients, the House of Gikuyu and Mumbi. They have been reminded regularly by the Agikuyu big men not to "get their history wrong" (Ernest Renan) by being Kenyan. The centripetal call has been on them to be the children of the home, andu wa mucii. William Ochieng', the guild historian from Majimbo sublocation in Yimbo, western Kenya, remains very much an outsider, a mundu waruguru in this pained and urgent exercise in the production of Mau Mau history. Paradoxically, he also remains right at the center of it, as a member of the Kenyan civil society. Bibliography Atieno-Odhiambo, E. S. 198Ia. "Who Were the Mau Mau?"
