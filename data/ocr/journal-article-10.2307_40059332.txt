<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIMONE WEIL AND WALLACE STEVENS: THE NOTION OF DECREATION AS SUBTEXT IN "AN ORDINARY EVENING IN NEW HAVEN" James Lindroth Wallace Stevens' deathbed conversion to an orthodox Christian faith, recently reported by Peter Brazeau in Parts of a World: Wallace Stevens Remembered: An Oral Biography (294-96), has been met with cynicism by James K. Guimond, among others, who speaks of it as a "final in- surance policy" (339) and with outright denial by his daughter Holly (Brazeau 310). Yet Stevens' correspondence with Sister M. Bernetta Quinn,1 his reading of Simone Weil toward the end of his life,2 and the corpus of Stevens' poetry, particularly the late poems, bear witness to a strong religious concern often commented upon by his critics - although most, like Milton J. Bates in his authoritative new biography, find it subordinate to and ultimately subsumed by his poetic theory.3 However, unlike "The Man with the Blue Guitar" and "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction," earlier poems to which it is frequently compared, "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," composed in 1949 just prior to Stevens' seventieth birthday, contains a subtext echoing Simone Weil's religious meditations and displaying a spritual ascesis in accord with the poet's final religious act.4 It is not only fitting that Wallace Stevens should be drawn to Simone Weil, a figure whose belief presents a religious paradox as problematic as his own, but that Weil's mystical notion of decreation should pro- vide a key to the understanding of one of Stevens' most difficult and, at the same time, most religious poems. Weil's meditations on decre- ation appear in her notebooks and were included in Gu stave Thibon's selections from these notebooks, published under the title La Pesanteur R&amp;L 19.1 (Spring 1987) 43</page><page sequence="2">44 Religion &amp; Literature et la grace in 1947, two years before the composition of the Stevens poem. It is to this selection that Stevens refers in The Necessary Angel, and it is from this selection that he draws the notion of decreation to emphasize the absolute value of artistic effort in his consideration of poetry's rela- tionship to painting. "Simone Weil in La Pesanteur et la grace" says Stevens, citing the edi- tion by its complete French title, "has a chapter on what she calls de- creation. She says that decreation is making pass from the created to the uncreated, but that destruction is making pass from the created to nothingness" (174-75). In this essay, "The Relations between Poetry and Painting," Stevens only appropriates Weil's notion of decreation for the purposes of his familiar aesthetic argument that in the modern world the poet functions as a substitute for God. Still, from the stand- point of his late poetry in general and more particularly as it applies to "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," Stevens' acknowledgment of a full familiarity with the Weil text becomes critically significant, as does the undeniable sympathy between the two as religious thinkers. If Weil's mystical notion of the decreation of self is a pertinent idea for Stevens in his later years, so are the correlative notions of spiritual gravity, a hidden God, affliction, and the renunciation of time.5 Decreation, as postulated by Weil in La Pesanteur et la grace, is mak- ing "something created pass into the uncreated," and to this she op- poses the notion of destruction, making "something created pass into nothingness," which she calls a "blameworthy substitute for decreation" (78).6 For Weil, the uncreated, another term for reality, is identified with God, and the passage from the created to the uncreated is not a fall into nothingness but the attainment of God. Yet this attainment of God, through decreation, depends on the individual's willingness to become nothing, to detach himself from sense life, and ultimately even from a "belief in the prolongation of life," robbing "death of its purpose" of allowing the individual to attain divine being (84). Within this mystical formulation, man's greatest enemy is the world of ap- pearances to which he clings in a desperate effort to prolong life. "Ap- pearance clings to being," asserts Weil, "and pain alone can tear them from each other. For whoever is in possession of being there can be no appearance. Appearance chains being down" (86). Here, Weil's chain metaphor emphatically evokes her notion of spiritual gravity, the force that binds one to the created world of appearance and time.7 Paradoxically, and it is a paradox fully explored by Stevens in "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," time, man's enemy in the conven- tional sense, becomes his salvation, since time "in its course tears ap-</page><page sequence="3">JAMES LINDROTH 45 pearance from being and being from appearance, by violence. Time makes it manifest that it is not eternity" (86). Weil's notions of decreation and spiritual gravity manifest themselves in the Stevens poem through two informing impulses. The first of these is the poet's stated intention: the need to strip created reality of all illu- sion. "Here," declares Stevens of "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," "my interest is to try to get as close to the ordinary, the commonplace and the ugly as it is possible for a poet to get. It is not a question of grim reality but plain reality" {Letters 636). The poem's second inform- ing impulse is the desire to embrace uncreated reality.8 This double movement produces a subtle text continually questioning the poet's rela- tionship to the phenomenal world of appearances, and an even subtler subtext presenting man's relationship to the noumenal, to uncreated spiritual reality - to God. Attending to the first movement done has invariably led critics to reductive interpretations: some dismissing the poem as an aging poet's cry of despair over the loss of imagination; others finding a saving ballast in what they mistakenly judge to be the old Stevens' renewed affirma- tion of the sense world. Helen Vendler, for instance, invoking "Dejec- tion: An Ode," sees the Stevens poem as a "long expansion of Cole- ridge's disjunction before the moon and the stars," the depression of the poet experiencing the "metabolic depletion" of age (271). In a sim- ilar fashion, Harold Bloom, although rejecting Vendler's interpreta- tion of the poem as a "portrayal of dessication" (305) is equally reduc- tive in his insistence that the poem is a Whitmanian celebration of sense life and that the final canto presents reality as "the solipsistic recognition of privileged moments, sudden perfections of sense, flakes of fire, fluttering things having distinct shapes" (336). At the heart of "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" is neither "metabolic depletion" nor celebratory "solipsism" but, as is the case with Weil's meditations, the notion of ascetic denial leading to spiritual life, to being, to God. Like Weil, Stevens raises the ordinary to a mystical level where the drama of decreation is presented in terms of the shed- ding of appearances, the renunciation of the created in time, the ac- ceptance of nothingness: "The dilapidation of dilapidations" (16.3), "total leaflessness" (16.18), "The dominant blank" (17. 7).9 As a major obstacle to decreation, Weil postulates spiritual gravity, the pull exerted by the world of appearances (45-48), 10 and it is in the exact middle of the poem, cantos XV, XVI, and XVII, that Stevens gives his most com- pelling evidence of this spritual gravity at work. Canto XV, for example, places the drama of decreation against a</page><page sequence="4">46 Religion &amp; Literature rain-drenched landscape where the rain heightens man's awareness of the sense world, drawing him to it and away from the spiritual: He preserves himself against the repugnant rain By an instinct for a rainless land, the self Of his self, come at upon wide delvings of wings. The instinct for heaven had its counterpart: The instinct for earth, for New Haven, for his room, The gay tournamonde as of a single world In which he is and as and is are one. For its counterpart a kind of counterpoint Irked the wet wallows of the water-spout. The rain kept falling loudly in the trees And on the ground. The hibernal dark that hung In primavera, the shadow of bare rock, Becomes the rock of autumn, glittering, Ponderable source of each imponderable, The weight we lift with the finger of a dream, The heaviness we lighten by light will, By the hand of desire, faint, sensitive, the soft Touch and trouble of the touch of the actual hand. Because of his "instinct for heaven," the protagonist in this drama of decreation finds the rain "repugnant" rather than refreshing, and he "preserves himself against" it by "an instinct for a rainless land." It is against the backdrop of this rainless land, the biblical desert of purifica- tion, that Stevens situates the protagonist's "self/ Of his self," the hid- den "I" spoken of by Weil ("My T is hidden for me ... it is on the side of God, it is in God, it is God" [85]); and the discovery of this hidden "I" is accompanied by the traditional sign of contact with the holy, the "wide delving of wings. But this is poetic drama, not plati- tude, and set against the man's "intinct for heaven" is an equally pow- erful "instinct for earth, for New Haven, for his room, / The gay tour- namonde as of a single world / In which he is and as and is are one." "Tournamonde," providing as it does a strong echo of Weil's notion of spiritual gravity, is central here, and in a letter to Herbert Weinstock, his editor at Knopf, Stevens gives the following explanation of the word. "Tournamonde," Stevens says, "is a neologism. For me it creates an image of a world in which things revolve and the word is therefore appropriate in the collocation of is and as. . . . I think the word justifies itself in the sense of conveying an immediate, even though rather vague, meaning" (Lettters 699n). If the movement to God's spiritual reality is outward, away from the apparent self and the created world, the move-</page><page sequence="5">JAMES LINDROTH 47 ment here is centripetal and inward, in which the man revolves in tighter and tighter circles of the illusory self. It is not the joy of God that at- tracts but the gaiety of appearances, the world whose constant move- ment creates the illusion of being where "is" and "as" are the same. Canto XVI heightens the drama of decreation with further evidence of the pull of gravity emanating from creation and time: Among time's images, there is not one Of this present, the venerable mask above The dilapidation of dilapidations. The oldest-newest day is the newest alone. The oldest-newest night does not creak by, With lanterns, like a celestial ancientness. Silently it heaves its youthful sleep from the sea - The Oklahoman - the Italian blue Beyond the horizon with its masculine, Their eyes closed, in a young palaver of lips. And yet the wind whimpers oldly of old age In the western night. The venerable mask, In this perfection, occasionally speaks And something of death's poverty is heard. This should be tragedy's most moving face. It is a bough in the electric light And exhalations in the eaves, so little To indicate the total leaflessness. The opening of this canto presents one of time's most powerfully at- tractive images in the spectacle of the natural world continually renewing itself, but it is the figures of youth and old age, renewal and exhaus- tion, birth and death that give it its dramatic structure. Moreover, subtending the canto's entire drama is the notion of nudity, the total purity achieved, according to Weil, at only two points of existence: birth and death (84). Death, an emphatic point of nudity for Weil and Stevens alike, is suggested by the "dilapidation of dilapidations" and by the late-autumn tree bereft of its leaves, reduced from the image of fecundity to the bare line of "a bough in the electric light," to "total leaflessness." The second point of nudity, birth, is suggested by the two paradoxes of the "oldest-newest day" and the "oldest-newest night"; or rather the two points intersect, since as the day dies the night is born as "Silently it heaves its youthful sleep from the sea" and encroaches on "The Okla- homan- the Italian blue" disappearing beyond the mind's horizon. This symbolic intersection of birth and death resonates with and reinforces</page><page sequence="6">48 Religion &amp; Literature a similar intersection in canto XV where Stevens juxtaposes winter, the season of death, with spring, the season of new life, through "The hibernal dark that" hangs "In primavera." Moreover, in both cantos XV and XVI, the opposites of youth and age, renewal and exhaustion, birth and death combine in a metamor- phic process resulting in a denudation of existence synonymous with Weil's notion of decreation. In canto XV, the darkness of winter already present in the spring landscape in the "shadow of rock" is transformed into the "rock of autumn"; in canto XVI, the "masculine" light of the "oldest-newest day" retreating from the implicitly feminine darkness of the "oldest-newest night" is metamorphosed into the asexual, bar- ren "electric light" illuminating the once youthful lips and eyes ("Their eyes closed, in a young palaver of lips") now shrunk into "The venerable mask" of age. Finally, both cantos conclude with emphatic symbols of existence stripped bare: the "rock of autumn" and "total leaflessness." A major part of the drama of decreation derives from Weil's postulating a God who "could create only by hiding himself" (85) with the consequence that "God and the supernatural are hidden and formless in the universe" (104). n Stevens meditates on the hiddenness of un- created reality throughout "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," but a particularly clear example of such meditation presents itself in canto XVII where Weil's absent God, the hidden holiness, is poetically evoked as "The dominant blank, the unapproachable": The color is almost the color of comedy, Not quite. It comes to the point and at the point, It fails. The strength at the centre is serious. Perhaps instead of failing it rejects As a serious strength rejects pin-idleness. A blank underlies the trials of device, The dominant blank, the unapproachable. This is the mirror of the high serious: Blue verdured into a damask's lofty symbol, Gold easings and ouncings and fluctuations of thread And beetling of belts and lights of general stones, Like blessed beams from out a blessed bush Or the wasted figurations of the wastes Of night, time and the imagination, Saved and beholden, in a robe of rays. These fitful sayings are, also, of tragedy: The serious reflection is composed Neither of comic nor tragic but of commonplace.</page><page sequence="7">JAMES LINDROTH 49 In discussing Weil's argument that perfect love of God is possible "only in actual affliction" and His "total absence," Eric O. Springsted in Christus Mediator: Platonic Mediation in the Thought ofSimone Weil, points to Weil's emphasis on parallel notions in Saint John of the Cross and Plato (134). 12 If Stevens evokes the hidden God through "The dominant blank" and the problematic of affliction through his opening rejection of comedy, he also, like Weil, reinforces these notions with imagery drawn from the Bible, the literature of mysticism, and Plato. For example, Stevens' "wasted figurations of the wastes / Of night" evokes not only the Old Testament prophet's desert of purification and Christ's agony in the garden but the mystic's dark night of the soul. Moreover, drawing upon the imagery of Plato's cave and upon the Old Testament figure of the Burning Bush, Stevens renders the relation between uncreated and created reality as light reflected in darkness, and at the same time hints at the hidden God suddenly revealed in a "robe of rays." These major themes of Weil - decreation of self in and through time, the pull of gravity exerted on the spirit by the world of appearances, affliction that leads to a freeing of the spirit, and a God who is hid- den-resonate throughout "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," with the world of appearances receiving particularly strong emphasis in its opening cantos. Canto I, a meditation on spiritual gravity, first postulates a Platonic world of appearances and then suggests the way in which man under the force of this gravity produces an illusory God fashioned on the model of self: The eye's plain version is a thing apart, The vulgate of experience. Of this, A few words, an and yet, and yet, and yet - As part of the never-ending meditation, Part of the question that is a giant himself: Of what is this house composed if not of the sun, These houses, these difficult objects, dilapidate Appearances of what appearances, Words, lines, not meanings, not communications, Dark things without a double, after all, Unless a second giant kills the first - A recent imagining of reality, Much like a new resemblance of the sun, Down-pouring, up-springing and inevitable, A large poem for a larger audience, As if the crude collops came together as one, A mythological form, a festival sphere, A great bosom, beard and being, alive with age.</page><page sequence="8">50 Religion &amp; Literature Starting with the "eye's plain version" dramatically contrasted to the "experience" of transcendence, then focusing his attention on the first of these, Stevens ponders the material world as manifested in the houses and streets of New Haven and offers the possibility that these crea- tions of light are illusions lacking substance, "Dark things without a double." This pessimistic questioning of created reality leads to a sec- ond question which, displacing the first, relates the material site of ex- istence to the "crude collops" coming together in the imagination as an androgynous "mythological form" with "great bosom, beard, and being." The figure of the giant, with his great height but also his great weight, dramatically displays man operating under the force of grav- ity, first dismissing plain reality because he is not the uncreated self supporting it and then filling the "dominant blank" of the absent God with one of his own making. In each case, the figure of the giant, Polyphemus translated to Plato's cave, emphasizes the obscured vision of the questioner and implies an ultimately unsatisfactory answer to the question of being. Stevens demonstrates his emphatic rejection of this second "giant," the anthropomorphic god of mythology, in canto XXIV where this god in the guise of "The statue of Jove" is blown up "among the boomv clouds" (24.4V13 "The reality of the world," Weil asserts, is "the reality of the self which we transfer to things. It has nothing to do with independent reality. That is only perceptible through total detachment" (59). Having ex- amined New Haven, the material site of existence, as appearance and reflection, Stevens in canto II meditates on Weil's notion of the world as an extension of self: Suppose these houses are composed of ourselves, So that they become an impalpable town, full of Impalpable bells, transparencies of sound, Sounding in transparent dwellings of the self, Impalpable habitations that seem to move In the movement of the colors of the mind, The far-fire flowing and the dim-coned bells Coming together in a sense in which we are poised, Without regard to time or where we are, In the perpetual reference, object Of the perpetual meditation, point Of the enduring, visionary love, Obscure, in colors whether of the sun Or mind, uncertain in the clearest bells, The spirit's speeches, the indefinite,</page><page sequence="9">JAMES LINDROTH 51 Confused illuminations and sonorities, So much ourselves, we cannot tell apart The idea and the bearer-being of the idea. If one answer to the question of being lies in the direction of Plato's shadow-world of appearances, and another in the direction of the god of mythology, still a third looks to external reality as spiritualized self. On one hand, this version of reality has the advantage of freeing the self from limitations of "time" and space; it has a second advantage of situating the self at the metaphysical center. From this central point of intersection issue the "transparencies of sound" and the "colors of the mind" that come "together" as the impalpable town the way the "crude collops" came together as "mythological form." The disadvantages are that although situated at the metaphysical center and poised between created reality and the "visionary love" of the uncreated, the self has in Weil's sense transferred its reality to the reality of the created world with the effect of confusion. Subject-object distinctions vanish; and in "the indefinite, / Confused illuminations and sonorities" that result "The idea," the "impalpable town," the "transparent dwellings of self," can no longer be distinguished from "the bearer-being of the idea." Turning from the versions of created reality postulated in the first two cantos, Stevens, in canto III, further heightens the drama of decrea- tion by directing his attention to the hidden holiness to be discovered through affliction and selfless love: The point of vision and desire are the same. It is to the hero of midnight that we pray On a hill of stones to make beau mont thereof. If it is misery that infuriates our love, If the black of night stands glistening on beau mont, Then, ancientest saint ablaze with ancientest truth, Say next to holiness is the will thereto, And next to love is the desire for love, The desire for its celestial ease in the heart, Which nothing can frustrate, that most secure, Unlike love in possession of that which was To be possessed and is. But this cannot Possess. It is desire, set deep in the eye, Behind all actual seeing, in the actual scene, In the street, in a room, on a carpet or a wall, Always in emptiness that would be filled, In denial that cannot contain its blood, A porcelain, as yet in the bats thereof.</page><page sequence="10">52 Religion &amp; Literature In drawing a distinction between the actualities of holiness and love and their potentialities, Stevens places the same weight as Weil on possession and the need to relinquish possession if divine holiness and divine love are to be attained. Weil's paradoxical distinction between being and having is echoed in Stevens' distinction, which in its elaboration situates desire "Behind all actual seeing" and raises its value above that of actual possession. For Weil, only "having," Stevens' "possession," belongs to man situated in the ordinary world; or as Weil puts it: "Being does not belong to man, only having. The being of man is situated behind the curtain, on the supernatural side . . . The curtain is human misery: there was a curtain even for Christ" (85). For Stevens and Weil alike, the divine, true holiness and true love, lie behind the curtain. It is this curtain of the ordinary that Stevens alternately examines and embraces, wraps himself in, and steps through. Or as Stevens expresses it in the last two triads of canto III, behind the "actual scene," "the street," the "room," the "carpet," the "wall," there is always the "emptiness that would be filled" and that can only be filled by being. As the drama of decreation unfolds in canto III, the afflicted Christ, "the hero of midnight . . . On a hill of stones, "displaces the self at the point of intersection between "vision and desire," between the created and uncreated. The imagery conflates two figures central to the no- tion of the afflicted Christ: the figure of Christ as "the hero of mid- night" undergoing the nightlong agony in the garden of Gethsemane; and the crucified Christ "On a hill of stones," on Calvary. 14 In his suf- fering, the afflicted Christ is the avatar of holiness and sainthood and in this sense becomes "ancientest saint ablaze with ancientest truth" whose holiness not only transforms the "hill of stones" into the "beau mont" but who embodies in his humanity the desire for the "celestial ease" of God's love, "which nothing can frustrate." Stevens returns to Weil's notion of affliction in canto XIX with the introduction of "A figure like Ecclesiast" (19.16). In this Old Testa- ment guise, the afflicted Christ functions as a bridge to uncreated real- ity, although the imagery providing the backdrop against which the figure appears is more emphatically that of Plato's cave rather than Calvary. A dominant figure of affliction emerges in two images: things not only shrouded in darkenss but lying "Prostrate" (19.3) in the re- flected light of the moon; and the transformation of daylight splendor into the privately sterile, the "public green turned private gray" (19.4). Negative changes wrought by time reinforce the sense of affliction, as the "man who was the axis of his time" (19.9) is reduced to the "in-</page><page sequence="11">JAMES LINDROTH 53 famines" of the original "image" (19.10). "What is the radial aspect of this place," asks the afflicted speaker, "This present colony of a colony / Of colonies, a sense in the changing sense / Of things?" (19.13-16). In his affliction, the speaker looks to a "figure like Ecclesiast," the em- bodiment of Old Testament wisdom in regard to suffering resulting from the depredations of time and the insubstantiality of created real- ity: "A figure like Ecclesiast, / Rugged and luminous, chants in the dark / A text that is an answer, al though obscure" (19.16-18). If the hero of midnight and a figure like Ecclesiast point toward Weil's notions of the uncreated and of affliction that leads to a freeing of the spirit, two other of Stevens' chief dramatis personae, Professor Eucalyp- tus and the black shepherd, restage Weil's drama of decreation with renewed vigor, as they show the self torn from gravity's pull by the assault of time and death. Through Professor Eucalyptus, Stevens refocuses attention on the world of appearances, and in canto XIV where Stevens first introduces him and canto XXII where he returns, Professor Eucalyptus provides another powerful example of man op- erating under the force of Weil's spiritual gravity. In the first of these two cantos, Professor Eucalyptus seeks God not in the realm of the transcendent but "In New Haven with an eye that does not look / Beyond the object" (14.3-4); more particularly "He seeks / God in the object itself, without much choice" (14.6-7). Caught by this powerful attraction to the created yet longing to discover the uncreated, Professor Eucalyptus presents a theological paradox echo- ing those of Weil. On one hand, filled with self he freely proclaims his own divinity in the "commodious adjective" (14.8), the "paradisal parlance" (14.13) that substitutes god-like word for plain thing. On the other hand, he achieves partial decreation, release from gravity's pull, through an "indifference of the eye" that remains "Indifferent to what it sees" (14.15-16). This neutrality of vision, if not of speech, sets up the possibility of a bridge to the uncreated through the unsparing presentation of its opposite, not "grim / Reality but reality grimly seen" (14.11-12). With the return of Professor Eucalyptus in canto XXII, the philos- opher and the poet conduct parallel searches "For reality" (22.2); in the philosopher's case the "search / For an interior made exterior" and in the poet's the search "for the same exterior made / Interior" (22.4-6). Like Professor Eucalyptus in canto XIV, the poet presents a paradox in that he demonstrates the powerful force of spiritual gravity through his emphasis on recreation of the here-and-now and at the same time discovers through this recreation a bridge to the uncreated. Intimated</page><page sequence="12">54 Religion &amp; Literature in "breathless things broodingly abreath / With the inhalations of orig- inal cold / And of original earliness" (22.6-8), the uncreated prompts the poet "To re-create" (22.12), "to search" (22.14) "a possible for its possibilities" (22.18). Just as in canto XIV, where "The tink-tonk / Of the rain" serves as a bridge to an "essence not yet well perceived" (14.16-18), here it is "the evening star, / The most ancient light in the most ancient sky" (22.14-15) that serves as such a bridge. In a similar manner, Professor Eucalyptus, the philosopher operating under the force of gravity and self, is like his natural namesake "The dry euca- lyptus" which seeks "god in the rainy cloud" (14. 1). Moreover, as sym- bolic comment on the Professor's search for God, the eucalyptus sug- gests the hidden flower of spirit still enclosed within its base material covering, and paradoxically this spirit will emerge not with spring rain as is the case in the natural world but only when total leaflessness, Weil's decreation of self, has been achieved. The introduction of the black shepherd in canto XXI further inten- sifies the drama of decreation, since through his meditation on the black shepherd's approach, Stevens, like Weil, stresses the painful rending of self from the world of appearance and necessity through the twin assaults of time and death. "Necessity," for Weil, "is the screen set be- tween God and us so that we can be," and she declares that it "is for us to pierce through the screen so that we can cease to be" (79). Stevens turns his attention to this "will of necessity, the will of wills" (21.3) with the appearance of the black shephard, but as a prelude canto XX evokes New Haven and the individual self assaulted by what Weil calls "Time's violence" (134): The imaginative transcripts were like clouds, Today; and the transcripts of feeling, impossible To distinguish. The town was a residuum, A neuter shedding shapes in an absolute. Yet the transcripts of it when it was blue remain; And the shapes that it took in feeling, the persons that It became, the nameless, flitting characters - These actors still walk in a twilight muttering lines. It may be that they mingle, clouds and men, in the air Or street or about the corners of a man, Who sits thinking in the corners of a room. In this chamber the pure sphere escapes the impure Because the thinker himself escapes. And yet To have evaded clouds and men leaves him A naked being with a naked will</page><page sequence="13">JAMES LINDROTH 55 And evey thing to make. He may evade Even his own will and in his nakedness Inhabit the hypnosis of that sphere. Under the force of necessity's will, the apparently solid forms constituting New Haven vanish until the town becomes aa residuum, / A neuter shedding shapes in an absolute" and its even more substantial inhabitants partially dematerialize into "nameless, flitting characters" dimly seen and faintly heard as they "walk in a twilight muttering lines."15 In response to time's assault, the man withdraws from the world in- to his "chamber," into the "corners of a room," into the self where "the pure sphere escapes the impure / Because the thinker himself escapes." Transformed through partial decreation into "A naked being with a naked will," the protagonist through his emphasis on the imagination shows himself to be still under the influence of gravity. "The imagina- tion," says Weil, "is continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass" (62), and this is the role of the imagination here. Instead of inciting the protagonist to acts of further decreation, the void (because it leaves "everything to make") becomes a test for the imagination, gravity's call for recreation in resistance to decreation. The canto concludes by reemphasizing, as a possible alternative to the self drawn by gravity into time's process of recreation, the earlier escape of self into the Platonic ideality of "the pure sphere": "He may evade / Even his own will and in his nakedness / Inhabit the hypnosis of that sphere" (20.16-18). Now, as the black shepherd looms up at the edges of the dominant blank, Stevens, in canto XXI, considers still another possibility: But he may not. He may not evade his will, Nor the wills of other men; and he cannot evade The will of necessity, the will of wills - Romanza out of the black shephard's isle, Like the constant sound of the water of the sea In the hearing of the shepherd and his black forms, Out of the isle, but not of any isle. Close to the senses there lies another isle And there the senses give and nothing take, The opposite of Cy there, an isolation At the centre, the object of the will, this place, The things around - the alternative romanza Out of the surfaces, the windows, the walls, The bricks grown brittle in time's poverty, The clear. A celestial mode is paramount,</page><page sequence="14">56 Religion &amp; Literature If only in the branches sweeping in the rain: The two romanzas, the distant and the near, Are a single voice in the boo-ha of the wind. Emanating from the black shepherd's isle and "In the hearing of the shepherd and his black forms," the sound of necessity is the sound of death's approach. This sound strips away the illusory pleasures of Cy there16 and draws attention to a contrapuntal sound, "an alternate romanza," emanating from "an isolation at the center." An end result of a decreative process spurred by "time's poverty," this "isolation at the center" affirms Weil's paradox that time aids decreation by "tearing appearance from being and being from appearance" (86). If the black shepherd defines one limit of creation and naked being another, the sounds of death and isolation marking these limits are contrapuntal; but paradoxically, like the decreative process in which the self gains the uncreated through annihilation, these opposites merge into the "single voice" of "A celestial mode" that "is paramount." In their turn, Professor Eucalyptus, the hero of midnight, and the black shepherd evoke Weil's notions of spiritual gravity, salvational affliction, and time's violent rending of the self from the world of ap- pearance and necessity. They also make it possible to discern Weil's drama of decreation in the otherwise perplexing roles of Alpha and Omega, the "immaculate interpreters" of canto VI: Reality is the beginning not the end, Naked Alpha, not the hierophant Omega, Of dense investiture, with luminous vassals. It is the infant A standing on infant legs, Not twisted, stooping, polymathic Z, He that kneels always on the edge of space In the pallid perceptions of its distances. Alpha fears men or else Omega's men Or else his prolongations of the human. These characters are around us in the scene. For one it is enough; for one it is not; For neither is it profound absentia, Since both alike appoint themselves the choice Custodians of the glory of the scene, The immaculate interpreters of life. But that's the difference: in the end and the way To the end. Alpha continues to begin. Omega is refreshed at every end. Omega, whose "dense investiture" suggests the weight of the human and whose "twisted" shape testifies to the force of gravity's pull, is, like</page><page sequence="15">JAMES LINDROTH 57 Professor Eucalyptus, tied to the thingness of things. As "Custodians of the glory of the scene" and the "immaculate interpreters of life" both characters, despite their apparent differences in that Alpha is "the in- fant A standing on infant legs" and Omega the "stooping, polymathic Z," demonstrate a similar inability to become disentangled from the created. However, considered in another way, Alpha and Omega present a demonstration of Weil's distinction between the different modes of God's presence. "The presence of God," says Weil, "should be under- stood in two ways. As Creator, God is present in everything that ex- ists as soon as it exists. The presence for which God needs the coopera- tion of the creature is the presence of God, not as Creator but as Spirit. The first presence is the presence of creation. The second is the presence of de-creation" (85). Stevens, through his personification of Alpha and Omega, Greek letters traditionally understood as signifying God, of- fers a strong echo of Weil. Not only does he evoke the created world through symbolic types, he also presents a poetic figure of God's presence in the created and subtending it. The figure is that of created reality as a circle closed at the point where Alpha and Omega meet: "But that's the difference: in the end and the way / To the end. Alpha continues to begin. / Omega is refreshed at every end." From the standpoint of God's support of it, created reality, as is suggested in Alpha's continu- ing "to begin" and Omega's being "refreshed at every end," is continu- ously created, and in this sense "Reality is a beginning not the end, / Naked Alpha, not the hierophant Omega." But for Stevens, as for Weil, this manifestation of God's presence is not to be confused with God as Spirit, the Spirit behind the dominant blank, the "profound absentia" to which creation points. "Time," says Weil, "is an image of eternity, but it is also a substitute for eternity" (65); and for Weil and Stevens alike, the Spirit behind the dominant blank can be attained only through the renunciation of time. It is in the final cantos of "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" that Stevens presents the most emphatic example of Weil's link between the renunciation of time and spiritual ascesis. The penultimate canto, canto XXX, in preparation for this final renunciation, opens with a scene whose barrenness powerfully echoes that of "The dilapidation of dilapidations," "total leaflessness," "The dominant blank": The last leaf that is going to fall has fallen. The robins are la-bas, the squirrels, in tree-caves, Huddle together in the knowledge of squirrels. The wind has blown the silence of summer away. It buzzes beyond the horizon or in the ground: In mud under ponds, where the sky used to be reflected.</page><page sequence="16">58 Religion &amp; Literature The barrenness that appears is exposing. It is not part of what is absent, a halt For farewells, a sad hanging on for remembrances. It is a coming on and a coming forth. The pines that were fans and fragrances emerge, Staked solidly in a gusty grappling with rocks. The glass of the air becomes an element - It was something imagined that has been washed away. A clearness has returned. It stands restored. It is not an empty clearness, a bottomless sight. It is a visibility of thought, In which hundreds of eyes, in one mind, see at once. Unlike Omega's men who attach themselves to the past with their pro- longations of the human, the protagonist rejects any such "sad hang- ing on for remembrances," any "halt / For farewells." Rather the "bar- renness" of the present moment readies the decreated self for a final renunciation of time and for the approach of the uncreated: "The bar- renness that appears is exposing"; "It is a coming on and a coming forth." Within the context of barrenness the decreation of self hurries toward completion as it finds its own relation to the uncreated repeated in the upward movement of the pines in their "grappling with the rocks" and in the transparency replacing the darkness of the cave with its flickering reflections: "The glass of the air becomes an element- / It was something imagined that has been washed away. / A clearness has returned." What is exposed is an Argus-eyed reality:17 "It is a visibil- ity of thought, / In which hundreds of eyes, in one mind, see at once." At the conclusion of this penultimate canto, then, the hidden God stands revealed and the passage from the created to the uncreated, Weil's decreation, is all but finished. The powerful final triad of the poem's final canto brings Stevens' drama of decreation to an emphatic close through a second extraor- dinary evocation of Weil's hidden God: It is not in the premise that reality Is a solid. It may be a shade that traverses A dust, a force that traverses a shade. In this canto, as in the poem as a whole, Stevens employs figures of incompletion and emptiness, "dead candles at the window" (31.5), "Mr. Blank" (31.9), a woman's canceled note (31.15), to mark the world of time and prepare for its renunciation. And if the black shepherd's approach can be discerned in the evening's "spectrum of violet" (31.14), so too does the earlier figure of the "fire-forms" (31.6), like that of the</page><page sequence="17">JAMES LINDROTH 59 "blessed beams from out a blessed bush" of canto XVII, announce the uncreated and prepare for the final triad's disclosure of God. In these last lines, not only does Stevens invoke Weil's God as Creator, her "presence of creation" (85), through the Biblical figure of Adam's crea- tion inhering in the "shade that traverses / A dust"; he also invokes Weil's hidden God, God as Spirit, God as the "presence of de-creation" (85), in the paradoxical figure of the force behind creation, the "force that traverses a shade." For Stevens, as for Weil, reality and God are one, and it is with these mystical hints of the spiritual fullness awaiting the decreated self that the poem ends. Seton Hall University NOTES 1. See particularly the letters dated 7 April 1948 and 21 Dec. 1951. In the first Stevens remarks on the striking similarity of their minds, after which he asserts that he does "seek a center" and expects "to go on seeking it"; in the second, he expressly states his belief in God, although not "the same God in whom" he believed as "a boy" (Letters 584, 735). 2. Stevens, who died in 1955, was sixty-eight years old when Weil's La Pesanteur et la grace was published in 1947; it is this edition that he draws upon for his essay "The Relations between Poetry and Painting," originally read at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951 and subsequently published in The Necessary Angel (159-76). 3. In his final judgment that "Stevens effaced himself before the Supreme imagina- tion" in the way that "Eliot effaced himself before the Supreme Being" (295), Bates is representative of those critics who reject the notion that what ultimately became most important for Stevens was the quest for Weil's uncreated reality, although the emphasis on the effacement of self is very close to Weil's notion of decreation. For other critics who agree with Bates in this regard, see Roy Harvey Pearce, The Con- tinuity of American Poetry (376-419); Joseph N. Riddel, The Clairvoyant Eye: The Poetry and Poetics of Wallace Stevens (224-78); Frank Doggett, Stevens' Poetry of Thought (1 42-68); Adalaide Kirby Morris, Wallace Stevens: Imagination and Faith (136-88). For critics who give credence to the religious faith manifested in Stevens' later poetry, see James Ben- ziger, Images of Eternity: Studies in the Poetry of Religious Vision from Wordsworth to T.S. Eliot (239-43); Leonora Woodman, Stanza My Stone: Wallace Stevens and the Hermetic Tradi- tion (147-63). 4. Stevens originally composed "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" on the oc- casion of the 4 Nov. 1949 sesquicentennial celebration of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences; the poem as read by Stevens consisted of eleven cantos, but Louis Martz reports that Stevens told him that he "had written many more parts" of the poem than "the ones he read" and that he "had selected sections and put them together specifically for the Connecticut Academy to suit the length of time he had to read it" (Brazeau 175). From the longer version of the poem, Stevens selected the following cantos: I, VI, IX, XI, XII, XVI, XXII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI</page><page sequence="18">60 Religion &amp; Literature (Letters 666, n 8); this shorter version is reprinted in the Samuel French Morse edition of the poetry, Poems By Wallace Stevens (145-52). 5. In a recent essay, "Toward Decreation: Stevens and the 'Theory of Poetry' " (286-307), Roy Harvey Pearce fully develops his early thoughts in The Continuity of American Poetry (412-13) on the aesthetic implications of decreation in Stevens' poetry; however, he considers the use of the term simple appropriation, and in neither case does he examine the religious ramifications of Weil as the term's original source. Leonora Woodman does consider the term's religious implications, but apart from Weil and only insofar as the term's religious implications, but apart from Weil and only insofar as the term relates to the hermetic tradition (104-126). It should be pointed out that Weil's notion of decreation is a mystical one, not to be confused with the concept of "deconstruction" in contemporary criticism; moreover, Roy Harvey Pearce emphatically rejects such an identification of the two notions, even if consid- ered from an aesthetic standpoint alone ("Toward Decreation" 354, n 1). For a recent example of deconstruction applied to Stevens in general and more particular to "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," see Charles Altieri, "Why Stevens Must Be Ab- stract, or What a Poet Can Learn From Painting" (86-118). 6. Because of its accessibility and acknowledged excellence as a translation, Grav- ity and Grace will be used as the source of all Weil citations. 7. "Creation," says Weil, is "composed of the descending movement of gravity"; to escape gravity's pull the individual "must necessarily turn to something other than himself, since it is a question of being delivered from self" (47-48). 8. As reported by Brazeau, Stevens, in a conversation with the Rev. Arthur Hanley, chaplain at Saint Francis hospital where Steven died on 2 August 1955, distinguished between created and uncreated reality as emphatically as Weil and in the same language: "He [Stevens] believed strongly in God. When he went to New York, he told me, he used to spend at least a couple of hours at St. Patrick's Cathedral, medi- tating. He said he got so much peace and enjoyment that he always, when he went to New York, went to St. Patrick's Cathedral. I think he had such a marvelous idea of what God was. The absolute idea of God. 'Everything,' he said, 'has been created. There is only one uncreated.' And that was God" (294). 9. All quotations are from The Collected Poems (465-89); "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" is cited either by canto (roman numerals) and/or canto and line(s) as a parenthetical reference with periods separating the arabic numerals. 10. "Weil," says Eric O. Springsted, commenting on this aspect of decreation, "con- tended that our natural attachment to our terrestrial existence is weighty and con- stitutes a sort of spiritual gravity to which we are constantly subject. Consequently, she argued that as long as we remain subject to this gravity there is no way from man to God" (Christus Mediator 117). 11. As Gustave Thibon points out in a comment on a related text, "contact with supernatural reality is first felt as an experience of nothingness" since "God does not exist ... in the same way as created things which form the only object of experience for our natural faculties" (Gravity and Grace 66n). 12. By way of elaboration, Springsted emphasizes Weil's singling out of "two periods of void" described in Plato's "Cave Analogy," two periods, which in Weil's words, "cor- respond exactly to the two dark nights described by Saint John of the Cross." The first of these occurs "when one is unchained and walks out of the cave without being able to use his customary, but illusory, bearings"; the second occurs "when one emerges from the cave and is blinded by the light" (Christus Mediator 134).</page><page sequence="19">JAMES LINDROTH 61 1 3 . This can be construed as a decreative act in that it conforms to Weil's notion that man must empty himself of "false divinty" (80); Jove as an anthropomorhic divinity modeled on self is an emphatic example of such falseness. Leonora Woodman sees this as a "token of Stevens' repeated effort to banish mistaken forms of the divine" (Stanza My Stone 109). 14. Frank Doggett, despite his acknowledgment that it "may seem to be a theological figure," goes on to identify "the hero of midnight" as an "archetypal image of the idealized and enduring self" (131); Charles Berger, in Forms of Farewell: The Late Poetry of Wallace Stevens, returns to the canto's theological possibilities when he calls "the hill of stones" a "type of the valley of bones" and "the hero of midnight" a "new presence" at the "pole" of "transformation" (93). 1 5 . Helen Vendler asserts that this canto conjures up the "experience of ultimate ascesis" (286). 16. Holy Stevens in Souvenirs and Prophecies cites a birthday poem written for his wife as the earliest example of Stevens' development of Cy there as sensual paradise (229-30). 17. Vendler stresses the presence of Saint Paul over that of Argus in this canto: "The poem becomes not only resurrection but beatific vision as Stevens continues with a variation on Saint Paul: no longer are we making rubbings on a glass through which we peer; the whole glass is suddenly transparent" (296); in a more recent and wholly secular reading, Steven Shaviro calls this "the incessant divergence of multiple per- spectives," an emphatic example of Stevens' "radical perspectivism in which the unity of the mind or of the world ... is only another perspective" (221). Seen from a reli- gious standpoint, this final canto still presents a "radical perspective," but as Eric Springsted says of Weil in "Contradiction, Mystery and the Use of Words in Simone Weil," it is a perspective which "sees a manifold diversity to the world which is unified and harmonized in the transcendent and divine" (10).
