<plain_text><page sequence="1">People ofthe Body: The Problem ofthe Body for the People ofthe Book HOWARD EILBERG-SCHWARTZ Department of Religious Studies Stanford University Perhaps all social systems are built on contradiction, in some sense at war with themselves. [Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger] Jews have frequently been described as the "People ofthe Book." But it would be equally appropriate to describe them as a "People of the Body." The former description emphasizes the life ofthe mind and the importance of learning within the tradition. But at the same time it diverts attention from the fact that the books, which were of such obsessive in? terest, were deeply concerned with the human body and bodily processes. In what follows, I explore how the people ofthe book became a people obsessed with the body. While many cultures are preoccupied with the body, there are specific, local reasons why the body emerges as problematic in any given cultural formation. This essay explores factors indigenous to ancient Judaism that turned the human body into a problem. To anticipate, I shall argue that the human body was the object around which conflicting cultural representations met and clashed. Like other religious cultures, ancient Judaism was not a tidy entity. Tidiness is a characteristic of philo- sophic systems, not cultures. Each culture has its own set of conflicting impulses that struggle against one another for hegemony. In the case of an? cient Judaism, at least in one of its formations, it was the human body that was caught between contradictory impulses.

These contradictions, which first surface in one form of Israelite religion, are inherited by the rabbis (200-600 c.E.) who continue to find the body a source of conflict. In relying on the idea of cultural contradictions, I depart from the gener? al tendency to think of Judaism as "a system" or series of systems, a met? aphor that implicitly and often explicitly guides research on Judaism. This metaphor induces interpreters to produce a coherence that does not always exist; the result is that one impulse ofthe culture is selected as exemplary at the expense of others. The idea of cultural contradictions allows interpret? ers to explore the full "dispersion" of cultural assertions.1 The idea of cultural contradictions has intrigued many theorists of soci? ety and culture, including Marx, Freud, Levi-Strauss, Gluckman, Spiro, B. Turner, V. Turner, Girard, and others. Contradictions operate at various levels and in various ways. For Marx, they are part of a complex social process such as capitalism, which produces a conflict between the techno- logical level and social condition of technological progress.2 Contradic? tions are also a phenomenon of culture. The Mythologies of Levi-Strauss show how myths are generated by and attempt to solve or hide logical con? tradictions that trouble the mind.3 Other theorists have examined how individuals are caught between competing demands emanating from vari? ous sources. Freud and his followers are particularly interested in the ways in which conflicts between physiological drives and cultural demands are handled. Spiro, for example, notes the intolerable contradiction in which pubescent boys and girls were placed in the early years ofthe Israeli kibbutz movement. In their attempt to create a sexual equality, in which sexual dif? ferences would assume little more importance than other anatomical differences, the kibbutz pioneers established a practice in which boys and girls would be routinely exposed to each other's bodies in bvatories, show- ers, and sleeping quarters. But at the age of puberty, the kibbutz severely prohibited any sexual contact between the sexes. "Here," writes Spiro, "is a classic example of incompatible demands. . . . Such a contradiction can 1Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans. A. M.

Other theorists, such as Max Gluckman, Mary Douglas, and Victor Turner, have noted how such con? flicts may arise from competing social commitments or competing elaims of the social system.5 For example, Ndembu women experience a conflict be? tween patrilocal marriage and matrilineal descent. Women live with their husband's family yet feel the pulls of their matrilineal kin. Fathers want their sons to remain with them, but the mother's kin want her and her child to return to them. This culturally produced conflict manifests itself in a variety of physical ailments, which are attributed to the attacks of de- ceased matrilineal ancestors. A similar sort of cultural conflict explains the disorder of anorexia nervosa. Young women afflicted with this dis- order experience psychic conflict generated by irreconcilable cultural ex- pectations.6 On this point, I find myself in agreement with Girard, who writes that "far from being restricted to a limited number of pathological cases . . . the double bind?a contradictory double imperative, or rather a whole network of contradictory imperatives?is an extremely common phenomenon."7 Expanding on the ideas of these theorists, I suggest that the idea of cul? tural conflicts explains why certain objects arrest more attention than others. Vast cultural and symbolic resources are invested in those objects around which conflicting representations revolve. The symbolic elabora- tion that occurs around such "conflicted objects" is both a consequence of and a strategy for dealing with the conflict in question. Objects that are caught between incompatible impulses are evocative, puzzling, and dan- gerous. The multiplication of rules that often occurs around such objects has the effect both of mastering a threatening object and of glossing the generative conflict. Under the sheer weight of legal minutiae, the original contradiction is lost from view. These conflicted objects make valuable symbolic resources. Caught between conflicting cultural processes, these objects are volatile; their power or energy can be transferred by association to other more stable cultural meanings. Consequently, these charged ob? jects are often used to symbolize and hence empower a variety of cultural 4Melford Spiro, Culture and Human Nature, ed. Benjamin Kilborne and Lewis L.

In ancient Judaism, cultural conflicts of this sort developed around the human body, generating an intense preoccupation with the body and its processes. Ancient Jews multiplied rules that both regulated the body and turned the body into a symbol of other significant religious concerns. It is to the conflicted Jewish body that our attention now turns. The Problem of the Body for the People of the Book To some it may come as a surprise that Judaism is a tradition that is preoc- cupied with the body. Judaism is often depicted as having a predominantly favorable attitude toward the body. As evidence of this positive tendency, interpreters point out that Jews are enjoined to procreate, with the result that sexuality has a positive regard within the tradition.9 Consequently, one generally does not find the tendency toward sexual asceticism within Judaism as in other traditions such as Christianity. Nor does the Hebrew Bible or subsequent rabbinic tradition treat sexuality as a consequence of "a fail."10 Sexuality is regarded as a natural human act that is part of what it means to be human; the sexual asceticism evidenced among the Jews at Qumran is thus regarded as a deviation. In addition, the sharp dualism of body and soul, characteristic of Greek philosophical traditions, is absent in the Hebrew Scriptures and is resisted in classic rabbinic sources.11 While these characterizations are true, they are also misleading.12 They ignore the way in which the government ofthe body has always been a cen? tral preoccupation within Judaism.13 Despite any sharp antithesis between 8This idea has an affinity with Victor Turner's insight in The Forest of Symbols, pp. 54-55, that physiological processes are often symbolic of more abstract cultural messages because they lend those messages a power that they otherwise would not have. The present argument differs from Turner's in seeing that power as deriving not from physiological processes, but from contradictions in a cultural formation. 9See, for example, David M. Feldman, Marital Relations, Birth Control, and Abortion in Jewish Law (New York, 1968), pp. 21-71; Peter Brown, The Body and Society (New York, 1988), p. 63; Robert Gordis, Love and Sex: A Modern Jewish Perspective (New York, 1978), pp. 98-109; Elaine Vagds,Adam, Eve, and the Serpent (New York, 1988), pp. 12-13. 10See, for example, Stephen Sapp, Sexuality, the Bible, and Science (Philadelphia, 1977); and Gary Anderson, "Celibacy or Consummation in the Garden?

The problem of the body in Judaism is already evident in those very writings that made the Jews a "People ofthe Book." It is in the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly that strand contributed by the Israelite priests, that the body first appears as a central issue of control. This part of Scripture, which is generally designated as "P" (after its priestly origin), includes nar? ratives and laws, which were generally thought to be written sometime in the sixth-fifth centuries b.c.e.14 It is in the writings ofthe priests, es? pecially the book of Leviticus, but also in the writings of the prophet Ezekiel (who was also of priestly descent), that the boundaries and integrity ofthe body arouse sustained interest.15 Leviticus pays particular attention to what passes in and out of the orifices, particularly the mouth and the genitals. Certain kinds of food may not be taken into the body (Lev. 11). Various genital emissions, such as menstrual blood, semen, and other irreg- ular discharges, create pollution (Lev. 12; 15). Concern with the body's integrity expresses itself in elaborate rules concerning skin diseases, which are contaminating (Lev. 13-14), as well as interest in congenital or acci- dental disfigurations ofthe body (Lev. 21:16-23), which disqualify a priest from serving in the Temple. Leviticus also proscribes intentional dis? figurations of the body such as shaving the corners of the face or acts of mutilation associated with mourning (Lev. 19:27; 21:5). In addition to these concerns about bodily boundaries and integrity, Leviticus strictly regulates the use to which persons put their bodies in sexual alliances (Lev. 18; 20: 10-21). This government of the body has both prophylactic and moral moti- vations. Many of the bodily regulations are intended to protect the sacrificial cult from contamination.16 A priest with a disfiguration or a dis- charge cannot perform the sacrifices, which must be done in a state of purity and wholeness. Furthermore, contamination that occurs among Israelites who are not priests can jeopardize the purity ofthe cult. "You shall put the Israelites on guard against their uncleanness, lest they die through their 14Some scholars following Yehezkel Kaufman attempt to defend a pre-exilic date for P. A review of this issue can be found in G. J. Wenham, The Book ofLeviticus (Grand Rapids, Ml, 1979), pp. 9-13. See also Richard E. Friedman, Who Wrote the Bible? (New York, 1989), pp. 161fT. This debate is not crucial for the present argument, which does not depend on pin- pointing the historical context in which the priestly writings were produced. 15I am not making any elaims about any specific literary relationship between the book of Ezekiel and the P source in the Hebrew Bible, a problem that has exercised a great deal of biblical scholarship. Rather, I am suggesting that EzekieFs priestly origin may have contrib- uted to his concern with the government ofthe body. 16Jacob Milgrom, "Israel's Sanctuary: The Priestly Picture of Dorian Gray," Revue bibliqueS3 (1976): 390-99.</page><page sequence="6">6 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz uncleanness by deflling My Tabernacle which is among them" (Lev. 15:30).17 But the concern with purity is not exclusively a cultic matter. Israel is enjoined to be holy, just as God is holy. Being holy includes observing the regulations governing what goes in and out ofthe body18 "You shall not eat, among all things that swarm upon the earth, anything that crawls on its belly . . . you shall not make yourselves unclean therewith and thus be? come unclean. For I the Lord am your God: you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy for I am holy" (Lev. 11:42-44). While being impure is not considered a sin, the state of uncleanness does signify an alienation from God. Furthermore, the violation of certain rules governing the body, par? ticularly those related to sexuality, does constitute an offense against God (Lev. 20:10-26). It is from the priestly writings that the concern with the government of the body first enters Judaism. Subsequent groups of Jews, including those at Qumran (second and first centuries b.c.e.) and the rabbis (200-600 ce.), take up and elaborate upon the levitical rules governing the body. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the rabbinic writings both reflect a preoccupa- tion with many ofthe concerns established in Leviticus. To be sure, this is not a passive acquiescence to tradition, since these groups transform the rules in sometimes radical ways. I have explored some of these transforma- tions in another context.19 Nonetheless, had it not been for Leviticus, the problem of governing the body would not have had the prominence it does within subsequent forms of Judaism. What follows, then, is an attempt to understand why the government of the body so preoccupied the priestly community. The Conflicted Body Mary Douglas has already speculated about why the body so preoccupied ancient Jews. The body, she argues, is frequently a symbol of society, and thus the dangers and concerns ofthe social structure are reproduced on the human body. "The Israelites were always in their history a hard-pressed minority. In their beliefs all the bodily issues were polluting, blood, pus, excreta, semen, etc. The threatened boundaries of their body politics would be well mirrored in their care for the integrity, unity and purity ofthe phys? ical body." Douglas also suggests that the levitical restrictions on the body stem from a concern with wholeness. Body emissions, skin disease, and de- 17A11 quotations ofthe Hebrew Bible are taken from the translation ofthe Jewish Publica? tion Society, Tanakh (Philadelphia, 1985). 18Douglas, pp. 51-52.

First, Douglas fails to explain why the body became particularly problematic to one specific group of ancient Jews, namely, the Israelite priests. If the external pressures on Israel induced a preoccupation with the body, why are the same sorts of concerns not visible in all genres of Israelite literature? Why is this preoc? cupation located principally in the writings ofthe priests? Furthermore, Douglas fails to explain why body emissions would be considered a threat to notions of wholeness. Why was wholeness defined in this and not some other way? The answer to these questions emerges when we consider the distinctive religious formation ofthe Israelite priests. Within this religious culture, conflicting and to some extent incompat? ible representations crystallized around the human body. On the one hand, the priests celebrated procreation. They not only believed that God com- manded humans to be fruitful and multiply (Gen. 1:27), but regarded reproduction as a central dimension of the covenant between God and Abraham (Gen. 17). But this impulse, which sprung from the social organi- zation and self-understanding ofthe priestly community, came into conflict with an important religious conception, namely, that humans are made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26?27). There is a fundamental tension between being made in God's image and being obliged to reproduce. The dilemma arises because the Israelite religion places certain limitations on the repre? sentation of God. To oversimplify for a moment, God has "no-body"? neither others with whom to interact nor a body (or at least a fully concep- tualized body) with which to do it. Thus the dual expectations of being like God and being obliged to reproduce pulled in opposite directions. There was no escape for the body. Pressed between these conflicting impulses, the body became an object of cultural elaboration. Let me unravel this conflict in more detail. Be Fruitful and Multiply Of all the Israelites who contributed to the Hebrew Bible, the priestly com? munity is by far the most concerned with human reproduction. Procreation is regarded as a central human quality and responsibility. In the priestly myth of creation, for example, the command to reproduce immediately fol? lows the creation of man and woman (Gen. 1:28). In fact, "Be fruitful and multiply" are the first words that God addresses directly to humanity. Ac- 20Douglas, pp. 124,51-52. 21 See Wenham, pp. 222-23.</page><page sequence="8">8 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz cording to the priestly writings, God twice reiterates this instruction to the survivors ofthe flood (Gen. 9:1, 7). The importance of human fertility is underscored by its close and frequent association with divine blessing.22 In both the myths of creation and the flood, the command to procreate is immediately preceded by the statement that God conferred a blessing (Gen. 9:1). It is not surprising then that the priestly writings regard this blessing as central to the covenant that God makes with Abraham and his descendants. "As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You shall be the father ofa multi- tude of nations. And you shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I make you the father ofa multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly fertile and make nations of you and kings shall come forth from you" (Gen. 17:4-6). As I have argued elsewhere, the priests re? gard the rite of circumcision as the physical inscription of God's promise of genealogical proliferation on the body of all Abraham's male descen? dants.23 In the priestly understanding, circumcision is not an arbitrary sign ofthe covenant, as many interpreters construe it, but a symbol that alludes directly to the substance of God's promise to Abraham, namely, to multiply Abraham's seed. It is no accident that the symbol of the covenant is im- pressed on the penis. The penis is the male organ through which the genealogy of Israel is perpetuated. The removal ofthe foreskin has the ef? fect of giving the penis the appearance it has when erect, thus symbolizing great things to come. Furthermore, the priestly writings suggest an analo- gy between an uncircumcised male organ and an immature fruit tree. They thus associate the circumcision of the male with pruning juvenile fruit trees; like the latter, circumcision symbolically readies the stem for produc- ing fruit. The priestly writings trace the fate of this blessing. When Isaac gives Jacob his final blessing, he prays that God "bless you, make you fertile and numerous, so that you become an assembly of peoples. May God grant the blessing of Abraham to you and your offspring, that you may possess the land where you are sojourning, which God gave to Abraham" (Gen. 28:3). This wish is subsequently fulfilled upon Jacob's return to Canaan, when God blesses him with fertility (Gen. 35:11). As his death approaches, Jacob recalls this blessing when he adopts Joseph's sons, Jacob's grandchildren, into his patrilineage (Gen. 48:3-5). The book of Exodus begins by noting that this blessing has been fulfilled. "The Israelites were fertile and prolific; 22Phyllis Bird, '"Male and Female He Created Them': Gen. 1:27b in the Context ofthe Priestly Account of Creation," Harvard Theological Review 74 (1981): 129-59; Sapp, p. 10; Jeremy Cohen, Be Fertile and Increase, Fill the Earth and Master It (Ithaca, NY, 1989), pp. 13-24. 23A fuller version of this argurnent appears in Eilberg-Schwartz, pp. 141-77.</page><page sequence="9">People ofthe Body 9 they multiplied and increased very greatly, so that the land was filled with them" (Exod. 1:6). As is now eyident, the preoccupation with procreation is intimately tied to the issue of descent. The priesdy writings are interested in reproduction as the means through which the genealogy of Abraham and then Jacob (Is? rael) is perpetuated and expanded.24 In particular it is the patriline, that is, the line of male descendants, that evokes interest within the priesdy writ? ings. This interest is evident by the fact that the priestly genealogies generally list only male names; the names of wives and daughters are ab- sent.25 The rite of circumcision also serves as a token of this symbolic link between masculinity, genealogy, and reproduction. Impressing a symbol of fertility on the male organ of reproduction establishes a connection be? tween procreation and masculinity and creates a community of men who are linked to one another through a similar mark on their male members. By contrast, the potential connection between women and procreation is symbolically undermined: menstrual blood and blood of birth, which could easily symbolize procreative capacities, are instead associated with death.26 There is a tension, therefore, between genealogy and reproduc? tion. For the purposes of genealogical reckoning, wives and hence sexual intercourse cannot exist. But the presence of women is always necessary because men cannot reproduce alone. The preoccupation with these twin themes of procreation and geneal? ogy makes sense given the historical situation and social organization of the priestly community. Israelite priests were an elite community who pre- sided over the sacrificial cult during the Israelite monarchy (tenth-sixth centuries b.c.e.). During this time, they regulated the sacrificial system in the Jerusalem Temple as well as in local sanctuaries outside Jerusalem. In the late seventh century, the cult was centralized in Jerusalem, and priests continued to preside over the animal sacrifices in the Jerusalem Temple. Scholars frequently date the priestly writings to the period during or shortly after the Babylonian exile, when pressures to increase the popula? tion may have been particularly acute. But there are other reasons, springing from the self-understanding and organization of the priestly community, that would also explain the concern with procreation. The priesthood was inherited patrilineally, from father to son. All priests were purportedly descended from Levi or one of his descendants, such as Aaron. 24See ibid., pp. 163-76; and Sapp, p. 12. 25 See Nancy Jay, "Sacrifice as Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman," mlmmaculate andPowerful, ed. C. W. Atkinson et al. (Boston, 1985), pp. 283-309, and "Sacrifice, Descent, and the Patriarchs," Vetus Testamentum 38 (1988): 52-70; Bird; and Eilberg-Schwartz, pp. 171-73. 26See the discussion of circumcision, menstruation, and the issues of genealogy in Eilberg-Schwartz, pp. 141-95.</page><page sequence="10">10 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz The priesthood, therefore, legitimated itself with a kinship idiom. This idi- om shaped the larger interests ofthe priestly community and accounts for the obsessive interest in detailing genealogies. The "begats" ofthe Genesis narratives are primarily the work ofthe priests. The interest in genealogy and reproduction are obviously linked. Since lineages are replenished through the reproduction of its members, societies that define themselves through a kinship idiom frequently focus intense interest on human fecun? dity and clear lines of descent.27 To put it another way, without procreation there would be no genealogy and thus no priestly community. It is for these reasons that the priestly community could not accept a myth of creation such as Genesis 2, in which the first person is initially cre? ated alone (Gen. 2:7).28 It is true that in this other myth God eventually creates a human partner for Adam and authorizes marriage and apparently sexuality.29 But here God's original intention does not explicitly include sexuality or human companionship. The decision to create a human partner is the result ofa process. After creating the first person, God unilaterally decides that it is not good for the first person to be alone and decides to make a fitting partner for the earthling (Gen. 2:18). It is at this point that God creates the animals, as if they might be a fitting partner for the first person. It is only when the animals turn out to be inadequate companions that God fashions a second person from part of the first person. In this myth, then, the first act of reproduction is a kind of fission: a second person is split offfrom the body ofthe first. The first act of reproduction thus does not involve sexuality. With the creation ofthe second person emerges the difference between man and woman, and this provides the basis for the institution of marriage, and presumably for sexual intercourse and repro? duction. While the authorization of marriage is regarded as the climax of the story by some interpreters,30 another reading is also possible, namely, that sexual intercourse and reproduction are not part ofthe human essence. After all, God originally created the first person alone; human compan? ionship, intercourse, and reproduction were divine after thoughts. Thus it is possible to construe this myth as suggesting that the human is most like God when sexual relations are renounced. 27See my survey of ethnographic studies of circumcision in Africa, which show a recurring linkage between issues of genealogy, virility, and reproduction (ibid., pp. 141-77). 28Most interpreters regard Adam in this story as male and Eve as being separated from a male body. See, however, Phyllis Trible, God and the Rhetoric ofSexuality (Philadelphia, 1978), pp. 72-105; and Mieke Bal, Lethal Love: Feminist Literary Readings ofBiblical Love Stories (Bloomington, IN, 1987), pp. 104-31, who argue that the original Adam is neuter and that sexual differentiation occurs only when a split is introduced. To avoid attributing a sex to the first human creation, I refer to Adam as "the first person." 29Gerhard von Rad, Genesis, trans. John H. Marks (Philadelphia, 1976), pp. 84?85; and Sapp (n. 10 above), pp. 12-16. 30Trible, p. 102; Sapp, pp. 12-16.</page><page sequence="11">People of the Body 11 It is with these sorts of conclusions, if not this particular myth, that the priestly story of creation takes exception.31 By synchronizing the creation of man and woman, the priestly myth avoids the otherwise possible conclu- sion that the sexual division of humanity and hence sexual intercourse and reproduction are not part of God's original intention in creating humanity. By locating authority for procreation not only in the creation account, but at the very moment of human origins, the priestly myth makes reproduc? tion an essential human trait.32 But the synchronization of man's and woman's creation while solving one problem generates another in its wake. Specifically, this notion of cre? ation creates a strain with another important conviction of the priestly writer, namely, that God created humanity in the divine image. In what sense can a sexually divided humanity, one that is expected to reproduce, be made in the image ofa monotheistic God, who has no partners? It is to this problem that we now turn. In the Image of God And God said "Let us make Man in our image, after our likeness, . . . They shall rule the fish ofthe sea, the birds ofthe sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth." And God created Man in His image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them and God said to them, "Be fertile and increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish ofthe sea, the birds ofthe sky, and all the living things that creep on earth." [Gen. 1:26-28] There are a number of conflicting interpretations of what it means to say God made humanity in the divine image. It is not my intention to decide which of these interpretations is correct, a hopeless task for reasons I shall suggest. Rather, I explore the implications of each interpretation on the presumption that it is correct. In other words, assuming that each in? terpretation is valid, what implications does it have for human embodi- ment and sexuality? To anticipate, I shall argue that no matter how the priestly community may originally have construed this passage, if indeed there ever was an original meaning, it must have experienced tension around the human body. 31See Frank Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, MA, 1973), pp. 293? 325, who argues that the priestly writer did not write a complete narrative paralleling the JE narrative but, rather, expanded and supplemented it. If so, then the priesdy writer felt com- pelled to supplement the creation story as told in Genesis 2. 32Sapp, p. 10; John H. Otwell, And Sarah Laughed: The Status of Woman in the Old Testament (Philadelphia, 1977), p. 16.</page><page sequence="12">12 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz The conflict in question springs from certain limitations that Israelite culture imposed on the representation and conceptualization of God. These limitations made it difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile aspects of human embodiment, particularly human sexual relations, with the idea of being made in the divine image. If these religious convictions had gained the upper hand, they might have generated a renunciation either of the body in general or of sexuality in particular. But these impulses in Israelite religion came in conflict with the priests' equally strong commitment to the importance of human sexuality as the vehicle for reproduction. I will some? times refer to these tensions as the "contradictions of monotheism." But it is important to bear in mind that these tensions appear most forcefully in one particular formation of monotheism, that ofthe Israelite priests. It is when the conviction that humans are made in the image of God appears in the same cultural formation that exalts human reproduction and sexuality that these tensions emerge most powerfully. Despite the voluminous literature on the "image of God" passage, the interpretations can be categorized into three major groupings. There are a variety of technical historical and linguistic arguments that support or dis- count each of these interpretations. These do not bear on the present argument which attempts to show that the body is rendered problematic regardless of which of these interpretations is correct. A Bodiless God Certain strands within Israelite literature suggest that God has no form, at least no form that humans can see or imagine: The Lord spoke to you out ofthe fire; you heard the sound of words but perceived no shape?nothing but a voice. . . . For your own sake, therefore, be most careful?since you saw no shape when the Lord your God spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire?not to act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever: the form ofa man or a woman, the form of any beast on the earth. . . . Take care, then, not to forget the covenant that the Lord your God concluded with you and not to make for yourselves a sculp? tured image in any likeness, against which the Lord your God has enjoined you. For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, an impas- sionedGod. [Deut. 4:12-24] This passage, dating to the late seventh century b.c.e., asserts that Israelites heard a voice but did not see any divine form during the revelation on Horeb. This is given as the reason for the prohibitions on depicting the deity in plastic art, a prohibition with roots in a much older tradition</page><page sequence="13">People ofthe Body 13 (Exod. 20:4, 20:23, 34:17; Deut. 5:8, 27:15).33 The original motivation for this prohibition is debatable.34 Archaeological evidence confirms that Israelite art did not represent God sitting on the divine throne, a proscrip- tion that originally may have stemmed from an Israelite ambivalence toward the institution of kingship. The representation of a god on the throne was one means through which ancient Near Eastern cultures legiti- mated royal authority. The prohibitions of such depictions in Israelite religion may reflect a desire to delegitimize the institution of kingship, a desire that developed during the Israelite tribal league when there were no kings in Israel.35 Below, I will suggest another possible reason for this pro? hibition. But whatever its prime motivation, the effect ofthe proscription is clearly to place restrictions on the visualization of God. Many interpreters reasonably assume that these Israelite impulses to "de-form" God provide the background for the priestly claim that humans are made in the image of God.36 In other words, humans resemble God in some qualitative sense only. Being made in God's image implies no re- semblance between the human and divine forms. Interpreters disagree as to the particular qualities humans and God share.37 But generally they in? clude the "spiritual" or "higher" human functions. Nahum Sarna is repre- sentative of this trend when he writes "the idea of man cin the image of God' must inevitably include within the scope of its meaning all those fac- ulties and gifts of character that distinguish man from the beast and that are 33See, for example, Gerhard von Rad, Deuteronomy, trans. Dorothea Barton (Phila? delphia, 1966), p. 49; and Brevard S. Childs, The Book ofExodus (Philadelphia, 1974), pp. 405-6, for the possible connection between the prohibition on images of God and the deu- teronomic idea that Israel only heard but did not see God at Horeb. The latter idea is very likely a later interpretation ofthe already existing prohibition. 34Childs, pp. 407-8, discusses recent attempts to explain this prohibition. Von Rad, for example, argues that images were prohibited because they failed to deal adequately with the nature of God. Similarly, Zimmerli argues that the prohibition reflects the idea that God has chosen to be revealed not in a static image, but in ambiguity of dynamic history. Below, I will suggest an additional reason for the prohibition: the representation of God would require defining the sex of God, which would force to the surface the complex tensions surrounding gender and sexuality that are implicit in Israelite monotheism. 35Ronald Hendel, "The Social Origins ofthe Aniconic Tradition in Early Israel," Catholic BiblicalQuarterly 50 (1988): 365-82. 36U.

Indeed, the idea that humanity is made in the image of God who is king ofthe universe slides easily into the idea that humans rule the earth: "They shall rule the fish ofthe sea, the birds ofthe sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth" (Gen. 1:26). This line of interpretation is supported by ancient Near Eastern parallels in which the king is said to be the image of God.39 In addi- tion, the priests considered God's activity at creation paradigmatic in establishing an order that Israelites were responsible for maintaining. Israelites were expected to preserve those classifications that God had im- planted at creation.40 According to these qualitative interpretations, the priests understood humans to be made in the image ofa disembodied and sexless God. "The Creator in Genesis is uniquely without any female counterpart and the very association of sex with God is utterly alien to the religion ofthe Bible."41 Embodiment and sexuality are thus traits that humans share with animals. "Unlike God, but like the other creatures, Adam is characterized by sexual differentiation."42 On this reading, the image of God does not parallel the human differentiation into male and female. It is "generic Man" that is in the image of God, but not humankind as sexually differentiated. The "im? age of God refers to neither Adam alone nor to Eve, but only to the two of them together."43 "Man's procreative ability is not here understood as an emanation or manifestation of his creation in God's image."44 We must be careful not to assume that because biblical writers associated reproduction with animals they therefore regarded sexual intercourse as a "beastly" activity. On the contrary, the command to be fruitful and multi? ply is considered a blessing that humans share with animals (Gen. 1:21- 22).45 Indeed, Israel is metaphorically identified with the herds and flocks, and multiplying like animals is regarded as a positive image.46 "I will in- crease Israel with men as a flock of sheep," says God (Ezek. 34:31). 38Nahum Sarna, Understanding Genesis (New York, 1970), pp. 15-16. 39Bird (n. 22 above), p. 140; Cohen (n. 22 above), p. 16; M.

On the one hand, human embodiment and sexuality are considered good; but they are good because God said so (Gen. 1:31) and because they are products of God's creative activity. Yet at the same time they are the very symbols of human difference from God. That is, it is the nonsexual and nonembodied part ofthe human person that is made in God's image. For this reason, there is a tension between obeying God and being like God. A person who wishes to obey God should be fruit? ful and multiply. But in doing so, one engages precisely that dimension of human experience that denies one's similarity to God. In fact, sexual inter? course contaminates a couple, alienating them from the sacred and hence from God. These dilemmas arise on any ofthe stricdy qualitative or spir? itual interpretations. But not all strands of Israelite religion deny that God has a form or body, as many interpreters have observed.47 Indeed, several sources make it clear that some Israelites imagined that God has or at least assumes a human ap? pearance (see Exod. 24:9-11, 33:17; 1 Kings 22:19; Amos 9:1; Isa. 6:1; Ezek. 1:26-28; Dan. 7:9). "Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel ascended and they saw the God of Israel: under His feet there was the likeness ofa pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity, yet He did not raise His hand against the leaders ofthe Israelites; they beheld God and they ate and drank" (Exod. 24:9). "And the Lord said [to Moses], cSee, there is a place near Me. Station yourself on the rock and, as My presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft ofthe rock and shield you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen'" (Exod. 33:23). The most detailed description of God is given in the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel sees "a semblance ofa human form. From what appeared as his loins up, I saw a gleam as of amber . . . and from what appeared as his loins down, I saw what looked like fire. There was a radiance all about him. . . . That was the appearance ofthe semblance ofthe Presence ofthe Lord" (Ezek. 1:26- 28). Since Ezekiel is a priest, it is possible that Ezekiel's image of God was shared by the priestly author of Genesis 1. There is, then, an important impulse in Israelite religion that does as- cribe a human form to God and assumes that, under certain conditions, the divine form is visible. Given this impulse within Israelite religion, an alter- 47Barr, "Theophany" (n. 36 above); Yehezkel Kaufman, The Religion of Israel, trans. and abr.

The repetition of the same terminology here suggests that humanity resembles God in the same way that Seth resembles Adam, which includes a physical resemblance.50 This latter interpretation ofthe "image of God" passage is compatible with the qualitative interpretations given above. Humans can be like God both in their appearance and in qualities.51 Advocates ofthe second interpretation, which "re-forms" God, believe this reading rehabilitates the human body in important ways. And to some extent they are right, Since the human form mirrors the divine appearance, having a body is part of what it means for humans to be made in the image of God. The form ofthe body ceases to be a sign of human and divine dif? ference. But on further reflection, it becomes clear that even the ascription ofa human form to God does not completely solve the problem of human embodiment, since having the form ofa body does not mean that God is materialfy embodied. From those sources that depict God's body it is im? possible to determine whether it is substantive. Indeed, one can make the argument that God's materialization takes other forms, such as fire (Exod. 3:2; Deut. 4:11-12). If God's body is immaterial, one that does not die, have emissions, require sexual intercourse, and so forth, then it is only the form ofthe human body that is legitimated but not the experience of em? bodiment itself. Furthermore, Israelite sources are extremely reticent about describing the divine body. Indeed, seeing God is considered dangerous and conse- quently appears to be the privilege of certain qualified leaders.52 According to one passage, God tells Moses you "cannot see My face, for no person may see Me and live" (Exod. 33:17-23). Even those sources that suggest that the full body of God is visible avoid any descriptions. When Moses, Aaron, 48See Kaufman, pp. 236-37; von Rad, Genesis, p. 58; Westermann, pp. 149ff.; Mopsik; and Boyarin. Barr, "Theophany," originally suggests this possibility and then changes his mind ("The Image of God" [n. 36 above]). For a history of this interpretation, see Miller, p. 292; and Westermann, pp. 149ff. 49Not all interpreters agree with this interpretation ofs.elem. For a different reading, see Barr, "The Image of God." Furthermore, most interpreters argue that the other term, "like? ness" (demut\ qualifles the term "image" and is intended to rule out the idea that the human and divine forms are similar. 50See Sapp, p. 8; Mopsik, p. 52.

Even Ezekiel is careful to qualify his description of God in fun? damental ways. He sees only "the appearance of the semblance of the Presence ofthe Lord." This circumspection about God's body?about de- scribing and representing it?is also evident in the way Israelite literature avoids certain kinds of anthropomorphisms. While God does a variety of human-like things, including speaking, walking, and laughing, God does not perform "baser" human functions, such as eating, digesting, urinat- ing, or defecating.53 In the official conceptions of Israelite religion, then, God's body is only partially conceptualized. This reticence has the effect of veiling the divine sex?and may indeed be partially motivated by the de? sire to do so.54 Ezekiel's description of God, for example, does not make clear whether God's lower regions are human in form: "From what ap? peared as his loins down, I saw what looked like fire."55 A similar concern may be present in the story in which God only allows Moses to see the divine back. Indeed, this incident (which is from the J source) is reminiscent of another story recounted by the same author (Gen. 9:20-27): when Noah is drunk, his son Ham (which means "hot") sees his father's nakedness. This is purportedly the sin for which Canaan, Ham's son, is subsequently cursed. When Ham tells his brothers, Shem and Japheth, what he has seen, they take a cloth, place it against both their backs and, walking backward, cover their father's nakedness; "their faces were turned the other way, so that they did not see their father's nakedness." The similarities between these two accounts are too striking to be passed over. Noah's sons walk backward and divert their gaze so they cannot see their father's nakedness, while God turns away so that Moses can only see the divine behind.56 It is as if God is being modest about disclosing the di? vine sex. Does God have genitals and, if so, of which sex? It is interesting that interpreters have generally avoided this question. This seems a particularly important lacuna for interpreters who understand Gen. 1:26-27 to mean that the human body is made in the image of deity. By avoiding the ques? tion of God's sex, they skirt a fundamental question: How can male and female bodies both resemble the divine form? Since God's sex is veiled, 53Sexual intercourse is one exception that I shall take up below. 54In a subsequent context, I hope to consider this whole issue from the vantage point of Lacan's argurnent that the phallus must be veiled. See Jacques Lacan, "The Signification of the Phallus," Ecrits: A Selection, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York, 1977), pp. 281-91. 55I would like to thank my colleague Tikvah Frymer-Kensky for pointing this out to me. 56The text suggests that God's modesty is motivated by a desire to hide the divine face "for man may not see my face and live" (Exod. 33:20). In another context, I hope to explore how God's face, or more specifically the divine mouth, is treated as a genital organ because of its generative role in creation.</page><page sequence="18">18 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz however, any conclusions have to be inferred indirectly from statements about God's gender. But however this question is answered poses a prob? lem for human embodiment generally and sexuality in particular. If God is asexual, as many interpreters would have it, then only part of the human body is made in the image of God. But suppose Israelites did imagine that God had a sex. Given the pre- ponderance of masculine imagery for God (for example, as man of war, king, father), Israelites would presumably have assumed that God had a penis, if they had bothered to think about it.57The story about the sons of God taking wives from daughters of men (Gen. 6:1-4, by the J writer) gives support to the assumption that the divine is considered male. And the parallel between the story of Noah's nakedness and the story of Moses seeing God's back might also suggest that what God is hiding is a phallus. While the assumption ofa divine phallus may legitimate the male body, it nonetheless leaves human sexuality problematic. To put it bluntly, what would a monotheistic God do with a reproductive organ? In official Isra? elite monotheism, God had no divine partners with whom to consort. Thus, in contrast to other ancient Near Eastern creation myths in which the gods copulate, Israelite creation stories depict God as creating the world alone.58 And in the priestly story, God creates the world by speaking.59 Feminists have emphasized the way in which an image of a male God cre- 57Some feminist writers have assumed that God's sex is male on this basis. For example, in Beyond God the Father (Boston, 1973), Mary Daly, in a section entitled "Castrating 'God,'" writes that "I have already suggested that if God is male, then the male is God. . . . The pro? cess of cutting away the Supreme Phallus can hardly be a merely 'rational' affair" (p. 19). Trible and others have noted the feminine images of God. But none of these writers have ar- gued that Israelites would have imagined God as being female, that is, as having a body with breasts, vagina, and womb. For an interesting exception, see David Biale, "The God with Breasts: El Shaddai in the Bible," History ofReligions 21 (1982): 240-56. Biale argues that the priests thought of God as a "God of Breasts." This is reflected in the priests' use ofthe term "El Shaddai" to describe God, a term that traditionally has been interpreted as "God Almighty." But the word shaddai also refers to "breasts," enabling the expression "El Shaddai" to be read as "God of Breasts." To strengthen his interpretation, Biale shows that this association is ex- plicit in one early biblical passage and that the priesdy writings use the term "El Shaddai" precisely in those contexts dealing with promises of fertility. 58Sarna (n. 38 above), pp. 12-13; Sapp (n. 10 above), pp. 2-3; von Rad, Genesis, pp. 58-60. 59Sapp, p. 1; Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain (New York, 1985), pp. 181-210. Scarry offers a provocative reading of biblical texts in the context of her larger argument about the relationship of voice, body, and pain. She sees a dialectics set in play by the fact that God is imagined as disembodied, as only a voice, whereas humans are embodied. This distance is frequendy transversed by a weapon, which mirrors the relationship between a torturer (who magnifles the regime's voice through torture) and the victim, who loses his or her voice through the magniflcation of bodily pain. Scarry's reading is illuminating in many ways. But her theory needs to be nuanced since it does not deal with those texts that imagine God in human form, an idea that confounds the sharp dichotomies with which she is working.</page><page sequence="19">People of the Body 19 ates a problem for being a woman. If God has the physical likeness of a male, the female body is by definition problematic. But what is emphasized much less frequently is how a monotheistic, male God also leaves males in conflict with their own bodies. If males are to be like God, then their pe- nises are only for show; they should not be used for reproduction. The form of reproduction that can most easily be reconciled with a monotheistic God is fission, as in the second story of creation. Thus even for the interpretation that treats the human form as made in the image of God, the body remains a problem in certain fundamental ways. If God has no sex, then the reproduc? tive organs of both males and females are rendered problematic. And if God does have a sex, whether male or female, God's reproductive organs are useless.60 These religious convictions, of course, could easily generate a sexual as? ceticism. But it is important to remember that the priests could not entertain this option. The theme of reproduction was so deeply embedded in their self-understanding and organization as a patrilineally defined com? munity that to reject these themes would have been tantamount to dismantling their community. So even if the priests had imagined an em? bodied God, the human body would have been left facing fundamental and irresolvable tensions. But these tensions are generally not visible. And they are not visible because the debate about the "image of God" passage gener? ally revolves around the question of whether that passage implies a similarity between the human body and the divine form. That debate draws attention away from the deepest contradiction of all: namely, the purpose of reproductive organs on the body of a monotheistic God. And it is per? haps this dilemma that contributes to the prohibition on representing God in material form, which is another way of hiding the problem of God's sex. The Sexuality ofGod If the attempt to embody God does so at the expense of God's sexuality (a monotheistic God can have no sexual experience), the obverse is also true: sexuality can only be predicated of God at the cost of divine embodiment. In other words, a monotheistic God cannot have both a body and a sexual experience. This second form of incompatibility is evident in the attempt by 60The only remaining possibility is that God is androgynous, an idea that does develop in late antique religions. On this view, male and female bodies are both partially made in God's image. Moreover, it is in the act of sexual intercourse, in the joining of male and female bodies together, that the human achieves the most complete reflection ofthe androgynous deity. This interpretation comes the closest to reconciling the division ofthe sexes with the image of God. But there does not seem to be any biblical evidence to support it. Moreover, a hermaphroditic God is a kind of hybrid, and the priestly writers generally find hybrids and other anomalies abhorrent. Finally, an androgynous deity does not procreate or have a sexual experience, thus still leaving an important difference between humans and the deity.</page><page sequence="20">20 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz some interpreters to reconcile the sexual division of humanity with the im? age of God. After all, it is reasonable to read Gen. 1:26-28 as suggesting that men and women are both made in the image of God. Phyllis Trible's God and theRhetoric of Sexuality is one ofthe most articulate expositions of this argument.61 In Trible's view, the division into male and female is what distinguishes humans from animals. "Procreation is shared by humankind with the animal world . . . sexuality is not."62 That is, although Genesis 1 says that both animals and humans reproduce, the attributes of male and female are exclusively human characteristics, at least in Genesis l.63 Ani? mals, by contrast, are divided "according to their kinds," a form of categori- zation that does not apply to humans. Through a literary analysis, Trible goes on to suggest that "male" and "female" correspond structurally to "the image of God." That is not to say that sexual differentiation can be applied to God.64 But sexuality is one ofthe human experiences that points toward an understanding of Israel's transcendent deity. Trible develops her argument by exploring the metaphors used to depict God. Not only is God metaphorically a father, husband, king, and warrior but also a woman who conceives, gets pregnant, gives birth, and nurses and mothers children. Trible's interpretation is self-consciously an attempt to recover female imagery and motifs within the Hebrew Scriptures. As suggested by the title of her book, her project includes the attempt to redeem human embod- iment and sexuality. Her interpretation thus goes a long way toward recon- ciling human sexuality with the conviction that humans are made in the image of God. But in crucial ways this interpretation also leaves the experience of em- bodiment and sexuality problematic. It is striking that Trible completely ignores the interpretation that ascribes a form or body to God. This omis- sion is curious in a book that seeks to redeem sexuality. Upon reflection, however, it is clear that this omission is a necessary precondition for any 61Trible's interpretation has been dismissed by some as a feminist reading that does not pay sufficient attention to the place of Genesis 1 in the larger context ofthe priestly writings (see, for example, Bird). To a certain extent, this criticism is valid. To read Genesis 1 as an example of incipient egalitarianism ignores the fact that the priestly writings generally privilege the male over the female. As noted previously, the priestly genealogies do not even mention the pres? ence of wives. But Trible's reading cannot be dismissed out of hand. As I have suggested, the simultaneous creation of male and female is motivated by a desire to legitimate procreation. But in order to do so the priests had to tolerate the seeming implication that both male and female are made in the image of God. To reformulate Trible's question, then, it is interesting to ask how and why the priests managed to tolerate the association ofthe female" with the im? age of God. 62Trible (n. 28 above), p. 15. 63 As noted earlier, Bird points out that the categorization of male and female is used else? where in the priestly writings to talk about animals. 64Trible, p. 21.</page><page sequence="21">People ofthe Body 21 interpretation that seeks a reconciliation between the sexual division of hu? manity and the image of God. Since there are no other gods, God's act of copulation can only be metaphoric. Ezekiel, for example, invokes the meta? phor of sexual intercourse to depict the covenant between God and Israel (Ezek. 16:8). While these metaphors do validate human sexuality in impor? tant ways, they still leave something to be desired. God cannot have an embodied sexual experience. If God has a penis, it plays no role in the di? vine relationship with Israel. From this perspective the metaphor of God having intercourse with Israel actually devalues human copulation in one significant way. If the relation of God to Israel is analogous to that of hus? band and wife, then what parallels the human act of intercourse is revela- tion, the insemination of Israel with God's will. Divine intercourse with Israel is mediated through speech. This substitution of speech for sexual intercourse is evident in Ezekiel's depiction of God's intercourse with Isra? el. Thus God says, "I spread My robe over you and covered your nakedness and I entered into a covenant with you by oath" (Ezek. 16:8). Israel is in? seminated with the divine will. It is even less clear how the analogy works when God is metaphorically a woman who is impregnated and conceives. Who is Israel's metaphorical father? So when the metaphor of human cop? ulation is projected onto the relationship between God and Israel, it effects only a partial reconciliation between human sexuality and the conviction that humans are made in the divine image. The rehabilitation of human sexuality must take place at the expense of God's body. It is impossible to simultaneously embrace the idea that God has a body with a sex and the idea that God is a sexual being. As soon as one of these ideas is grasped, the other slides into obscurity. In order for God to have sex, God must not have a body, and to have a body God can have no sex. Myth, Contradiction, and Ambiguity I have consciously avoided favoring any interpretation of the "image of God" passage in order to show that in any ofthe interpretations, the priests are left with their bodies caught in a morass of fundamental tensions. It is impossible to affirm both the conviction that human sexuality and re? production are divinely authorized aspects of human experience and the assertion that humans are made in God's image without at the same time rendering the human body or sexuality problematic in some aspect or an? other. To push this line of thinking further, it is possible that the uimage of God" passage never had a single meaning. James Barr anticipates me in writing that "there is no reason to believe that this writer had in his mind any definite idea about the content or the location ofthe image of God." But according to Barr, this hesitation stemmed from a "delicacy and ques-</page><page sequence="22">22 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz tionability . . . of any idea of analogies to God."65 But another possible explanation is now obvious. The ambiguity ofthe "image of God" passage may attempt to hide the fundamental dilemmas implicit in the religious for? mation ofthe priests. If so, then none ofthe contemporary interpretations of Gen. 1:26-28 can be construed as the original meaning of this passage. Rather, the wide range of interpretations testify to the power of this myth to simultaneously hold together what are radically different possibilities and thus gloss irresolvable tensions in the priestly religious culture. Indeed, it seems that the passage is carefully formulated so as to obscure, as much as is possible, these various problems. The shift between plural and singular nouns and verb forms is one means by which this myth negotiates the conflict between a monotheistic God and a humanity that is sexually divided. The plural "Let us create" has al? ways been puzzling to interpreters. Is the plural referring to other divine beings or is it a "royal we"?66 However this question is answered, it is clear that this construction glosses the problematic fact that there is only one God but two scxcs of human beings. Phyllis Bird writes that "cLet us' can? not be a slip . . . it appears also to have been selected by P as a means of breaking the direct identification between Adam and God suggested by the metaphor of image, a way of blurring or obscuring the referent ofselem"67 A similar obfuscation is accomplished by the shift from singular to plural in speaking of humanity (He created him, male and female He created them). The use of two nouns "image" (selem) and "likeness" (demut), the former seeming to imply a plastic representation and the latter a more abstract, qualitative similarity, also contributes to the confusion.68 Furthermore, in? terpretations ofthe "image of God" passages differ depending on which of these terms is taken as primary and which secondary. For example, most interpreters argue that the priestly writer introduced the more abstract term "likeness" to qualify the more graphic term "image," so as to avoid any suggestion that the human appearance resembles the divine form.69 Miller, by contrast, argues that the word for "likeness" (demut), which has lin- guistic affinity with the word for "blood" (dm\ was original and goes back to Mesopotamian myths that conceive of humans as made from the blood ofthe gods. The introduction ofthe term "image" was intended to rule out 65Barr, "The Image of God" (n. 36 above), p. 13. 66Von Rad, Genesis, p. 58; and John F. A.

See, however, Barr, "The Image of God," who argues that selem was the term most apt for avoiding the suggestion of resemblance ofthe human body and divine form. 69Sawyer, p. 420; see Miller, p. 293, for other references to this argument.</page><page sequence="23">People of the Body 23 this sort of interpretation by substituting a word for resemblance that did not have associations to blood. The second "image of God" passage only adds to the confusion: this pas? sage employs the term "likeness" to describe the similarity between God and humanity: "This is the record of Adam's line?When God created man, He made him in the likeness of God; male and female He created them." But the passage then goes on to use the terms "likeness" and "im? age" to describe the similarity of Adam and his son Seth: "When Adam had lived 130 years, he begot a son in his likeness after his image, and he named him Seth" (Gen. 5:1-3). If Gen. 5:1-3 is read by itself, it seems to suggest that the likeness between God and humanity is ofa different order than the likeness between father and son. The resemblance between God and hu? manity is described by the word "likeness" only. But Adam begets a son who is in both his likeness and his image. But if Gen. 5:1-3 is read as a supplement to Gen. 1:26-28, the opposite is the case: the same terms are used to describe the resemblance between Seth and Adam (Gen. 5:3) and between God and humanity (Gen. 1:26-27). The point of these myths, then, may be to hide the basic tensions through a screen of confusion. To be sure, these maneuvers do not entirely hide the problem. But given an im? possible task, these myths rise to the occasion. It is important to realize that the tensions that I am describing were not characteristic of all Israelite writers. As long as humans were understood as different from God, the impulse toward monotheism and the impoverished conceptualization of God's body need not have rendered human embodi- ment or sexuality problematic. The asexual or formless nature of God would pose less of a problem to the human body on the assumption that humans are made from the dust ofthe earth (Gen. 2:7). As an earthly sub- stance, humans would be expected to have functions and needs that God does not. Neither the impulse toward monotheism nor that toward a dis- embodied God in itself necessarily creates a problem for the human body. It is only when these tendencies are coupled with the conviction that hu? mans are created in the likeness and image of God, as the priests suggest (Gen. 1:26-27), that human bodies become problematic. For these reasons, it is in the priestly writings in particular, and not in Israelite religion as a whole, that the boundaries and integrity ofthe body become such an intense preoccupation. This cultural obsession, I have suggested, springs from the fact that the human body is caught between contending cultural impulses. This higher order contradiction is repro? duced at a lower level in rules governing sexuality. While the priests re? gard reproduction as one of the most important religious injunctions, semen is contaminating, even if ejaculated during a legitimate act of inter? course (Lev. 15:16?18). One might say that for the priests, therefore, people are "damned if they do and damned if they don't." In the very act of</page><page sequence="24">24 Howard Eilberg-Schwartz carrying out God's will, one alienates oneself from God by becoming contaminated. These tensions help to explain the obsessive interest in the human body in priestly culture. The elaboration ofthe rules around the body was in part an attempt to control a puzzling object. But these rules did more than con? trol a "foreign body." The absorption in legal regulations also diverted attention from the fundamental conflicts that surrounded the body. Im- mersed in the legal particularities surrounding ejaculation, menstruation, and skin disease, those inside and outside the priestly community would have lost sight ofthe larger dilemmas that inhered in the priests' religious culture. It is for this reason too that the body became one of the richest sources of symbols in the priestly community. As I have shown elsewhere, the circumcised penis is a symbol ofthe covenant, procreation, and patrilin- eal descent. In addition, distinctions among body fluids are associated with other symbolic meanings, such as that between life and death, control and lack of control, themes embedded in the larger cultural system of ancient Israel.70 The superimposing of such themes on bodily processes and organs effects a transfer of energy from the conflicted object to the theme sym- bolized and thus heightens the power ofthe latter. The human body, then, was the site at which conflicting cultural impulses met and clashed. It was that conflict that made the Jews more than just a People ofthe Book. They also became a People ofthe Body. 70Eilberg-Schwartz (n. 19 above), pp. 141-94.</page></plain_text>
