<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion, XLVIII/ 1, 19-43 Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin: A Many-Sided Debate Richard Crouter ABSTRACT Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge. Richard Crouter (Th.D., Union) is Professor of Religion at Carleton College. Currently he is working on a book about Hegel and Schleiermacher on religion.</page><page sequence="2">20 Richard Crouter "What separates both [Hegel and Schleiermacher] is still more often felt, or considered under relatively subordinate view-points that are governed by special interests, than it has been expressed with conceptual clarity"--Hermann Glockner (1930). "The differences between them here were not clear-cut logical disagreements but more matters of temperament and emphasis- differences which however have been historically decisive, as is clear from the development of German thought after their time"-Richard B. Brandt (1941). Preface Schleiermacher would be well advised to begin by issuing a few qualifying remarks. It is a formidable task to study either thinker. When we decide to approach them in relation to each other, we are confronted with even greater interpretive obstacles, three of which I wish to mention at the outset. It goes without saying that the first level of difficulty to be confronted by an interpreter of Hegel and Schleiermacher is the sheer complexity of their thought, which demands the utmost intellectual exertion. There is today no settled interpretation of the work of either figure. Both figures have been interpreted-in quite opposite ways-as having advanced as well as having undermined the cause of Christian belief and Christian theology in the modern period. A second set of difficulties might be called philological or textual. Both thinkers expressed themselves on relevant topics in a large number of texts, not all of which were published, several significant ones of which were revised more than once in their lifetimes, and for some of which there are as yet no truly adequate critical editions (Hegel, 1979: vii-xxi). Relevant material like Schleiermacher's Dialektik or Hegel's Vorlesungen iiber die Religions- philosophie (to name two of the most relevant texts) went through significant changes and alterations when delivered in lecture form, and our extant editions are based largely on student transcripts and editorial reconstructions in both cases. But it is not just the problem that some of the key texts needed for a full-scale, substantive comparison are themselves inadequate for our purposes. The textual situation facing an interpreter of their relationship is that there are no texts by Schleiermacher in which a critical review (and thus a potential refutation) of Hegel's work is given. In both cases works that bear on their view of each other's work are more oblique than direct confrontations. In thirteen years of association at the same university (1818-31) neither figure engaged the other in public debate or wrote a major critical review which names the other figure directly. We shall see that Hegel comes closer than Schleiermacher in publicly acknowledging the presence of the other figure by offering an explicit written critique. Although I shall argue that this criticism is extremely significant and by no means a mere "afterthought," such references constitute a series of footnotes on the corpus of Hegel's work, taken</page><page sequence="3">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 21 as a whole. For his part, Schleiermacher's asseverations against Hegel are mainly reserved for private communications, especially correspondence with fellow theologians in the German universities. In addition to these difficulties (the sheer weight of their thought and the disparate nature of the sources at our disposal), further levels of difficulty arise from the fact that the apparent differences between them have been virtually institutionalized among working philosophers and theologians. Thus analyses of the Hegel-Schleiermacher relationship are, more often than not, marred by relatively uninformed prejudice and one-sided judgments. This is perhaps the strongest reason for attempting to clear the air by exploring their relationship in its historical setting. It is a rare person who approaches them with equal degrees of enthusiasm and a sense of impartial objectivity. The reasons for this situation are perhaps obvious. For one thing, no meta-system is available to the philosophical or theological critic from which to launch a full-scale comparative analysis. More often than not the thought of Hegel is used as a framework for the analysis of Schleiermacher, or sometimes the converse. For example, Hermann Glockner, who is sympathetic towards Schleiermacher in the paper quoted above, takes Hegel's thought as the basis for the comparison since it is more systematic and conceptually clearer (246-71). In the absence of an appropriate framework or meta-system, the tendency is to use the thought of one figure as the basis for criticism of the other. Given this approach, predictable conclusions emerge. This is all the more the case at points where we do not find analogous interests, e.g., Hegel's lack of appreciation for a concern with the living church as community and with preaching, and Schleiermacher's lack of concern with the finality of a system based on a dialectical logic. What, then, is one to do in wishing to engage in comparative judgments about their teaching and work? By taking a historical approach to their relationship I hope to build a prima facie case for the impingement of the thought of the one figure on the thought of the other. This can be seen as a first step towards sorting out the thorny intellectual issues which divided them. By taking this approach I do not wish to argue that the substantive differences between them can be reduced to their individual biographies or, in the words of Richard Brandt, to their respective "temperaments"(326). We shall see that matters of taste, personal temperament, and bias enter strongly into their relationship at any number of points. But far from attempting to reduce their differences to these factors what I am seeking to accomplish is clarification of the biographical-historical setting as a basis for further study of their substantive differences. The degree to which either Hegel or Schleiermacher had a genuine influence on the other figure is still today a moot question. In one sense I think it is clear that they did not influence each other. Neither thinker depended in a substantial way on the thought of the other in coming to his own position; in both instances they were fully formed and committed to their views prior to the call of Hegel to Berlin in 1818. Yet in another sense I believe there may well be a significant influence between them. Part of what I shall argue is that in the</page><page sequence="4">22 Richard Crouter decade of the 1820s each figure served tacitly as the intellectual foil for the work of the other and that, at the height of their careers, it was virtually impossible for either figure to express his views on religion or philosophy without implicitly confronting the thought of the other figure. One subsidiary point yet to be mentioned is that in both instances the debate with each other is filtered through debate with other contemporaries. It is often the case that each writes for an audience of theologians and philosophers which encompasses but is not directly targeted at the opposite figure in Berlin. Thus Hegel's repeated criticism of philosophies of feeling and intuition is primarily aimed at F. H. Jacobi and J. F. Fries, but his need to refute their teaching is urged on by the belief that similar views are held by his Berlin colleague. Conversely, during the 1820s Schleiermacher was frequently involved in debates (concerning liturgy, theological method, and dogmatics) with Philipp Marheineke, and one suspects that his quarrel with Hegel was more directly expressed with his Hegelian colleague in his own department than with Hegel himself. For want of space this secondary level of the confrontation is largely omitted from the present paper. Faced as we are with all these obstacles, I suppose one might argue that the relationship between Hegel and Schleiermacher is virtually an irresolvable puzzle and simply wish to let well enough alone. On this view they were like ships (albeit large and impressive ones) passing in the night. Such a stance, however, strikes me as unsatisfactory for several reasons, the chief of which is that the masters of these ships knew that, far from just passing, they were contending for the same open seas. It is well, then, to remind ourselves that, despite their problematic relationship and many-sided differences, Hegel and Schleiermacher held certain fundamental views in common which today, among ourselves, are often radically called into question or just viewed with indifference. Both figures are part of that "new epoch" admirably sketched by Charles Taylor in his recent book on Hegel (3-50). Their commonly held beliefs include: first, that the university is not only a significant place of learning but also a major force in shaping and not just in reacting to currents of modern culture; second, that there could and must be a new accommodation between traditional religious and Christian teaching and modern thought, including humanistic as well as natural scientific inquiry; third, that the work of Immanuel Kant, which sought to reconcile man to the world by defining the limits of pure reason, was incomplete and must be supplanted by new efforts at synthesis and system-building. By disavowing knowledge of things-in-themselves, one denied to mankind a full compre- hension of the world and of one's relationship to the world, not to mention a knowledge of God. In view of these shared assumptions Hegel and Schleiermacher appear to have disagreed more about means than about ends or goals. The sibling nature of their rivalry must be kept in mind as we go about the task of relating them to each other and assessing the nature of their differences.</page><page sequence="5">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 23 Early Encounters and Foreshadowing of Differences As nearly exact contemporaries Hegel and Schleiermacher were vitally involved in the wave of German intellectual reassessments that followed the French Revolution and Napoleonic conquest of Europe. Central to this reassessment were questions about the role and meaning of religion in the modern world and its relationship to traditional Christian teaching. Wilhelm Dilthey, who wrote with discernment on the young Hegel as well as the young Schleiermacher, maintains that their views in the period around 1800 were not so far apart (1921: 149f.). Dilthey calls our attention to a passage in the fragmentary essay from the Frankfurt period, the "system-fragment of 1800," in which Hegel says that religion "makes no claim to be rational or reasonable." By acknowledging that there is a dimension of religion that is not to be fathomed by rational categories Hegel seems to be at one with the young Schleiermacher. But this commonality is illusory. The context of the remark makes it clear that Hegel has something else in mind. Although religion by itself may "make no claim to be rational or reasonable," it would be folly for philosophy to make such a claim on behalf of religion. Hegel foreshadows his mature position by arguing that "divine feeling, where the infinite is felt by the finite, is only completed by the fact that reflection is added to it and holds sway over it" (Hegel, 1971: 423). By asserting not just that religion is rooted in the nonrational but that reflection and reason must be added for its fullest expression, Hegel points to and anticipates his later criticism of Schleier- macher. At the same time, however, Dilthey is not entirely mistaken in arguing that the two thinkers shared a great deal in that early period. Each of them was seeking to address the same set of issues: the relationships between religion, philosophy, politics, ethics, and the arts. Both thinkers enjoyed long scholarly apprenticeships during part of which they served as house-tutors for the aristocracy. It is natural for us to ask when they first became aware of each other and what their initial reactions were. In his early theological essays Hegel was searching for a view of religion as the inner power of communal forms of life, a power which would unify a political community in the modern era the way the Greek polis was illumined and shaped by Greek myth. It is thus not surprising that he came to criticize the author of the Speeches along similar lines in his first philosophical publications. Although Schleiermacher's Speeches on Religion were ori- ginally published anonymously, the author's identity was widely known. What Hegel thinks about the Speeches is briefly set down in the preface to his first published essay, The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy, written in Jena (1801): "A phenomenon such as the Speeches on Religion may not immediately concern the speculative need. Yet they and their reception-and even more so the dignity that is beginning to be accorded, more or less clearly or obscurely, to poetry and art in general in all their true scope-indicate the need for a philosophy that will recompense nature for the mishandling that it suffered in Kant and Fichte's systems, and set reason itself in harmony with nature, not by having reason renounce itself</page><page sequence="6">24 Richard Crouter or become an insipid imitator of nature, but by reason recasting itself into nature out of its own inner strength" (1977b: 83). Far from being critical, Hegel views the youthful work of his contemporary as an important expression of the age's longing for an adequate understanding of religion and the relationship between man and nature. Hegel is also aware that the first book of Schleiermacher was having a mighty reception among his contem- poraries. His main point, however, is that the Speeches confirm the direction of his own work and point to the need for his own philosophy. Hegel cites the text the way a philosopher might call attention to a contemporary literary statement which to some extent corroborates his vision of the situation they share as thinkers. He is not overtly hostile, accords a certain respect to the Speeches, and tacitly acknowledges a common goal. Yet even at this early stage significant caveats distinguish Hegel's position from that of Schleiermacher. One must imagine that Hegel gave the Speeches a more critical reading during the next year. In Faith and Knowledge (1802) his remarks about the Speeches are more circumspect and point to their subsequent parting of the ways. At the end of a long section in which he criticizes the intuitional philosophy of F. H. Jacobi, Hegel expresses concern about Schleiermacher's reliance on intuition and the individuality of the subject-knower who has these intuitions (1977a: 150-52). He correctly sees that the Speeches argue for a full-blown religious personality that embodies individual genius, talent, artistry, and a dialectical mode of aesthetic and religious creativity. His basic point is that Schleiermacher's notion of religion is rooted in a subjective experience that is in danger of never attaining an adequate objective embodiment. If the analogy with the arts is taken seriously-and Hegel perceives that Schleiermacher meant it to be taken seriously-we are in a situation in which "art is supposed to be forever without works of art; and the freedom of the highest intuition is supposed to consist in singularity and the possession of personal originality." By pressing the analogy with the artist, Hegel hopes to show that Schleiermacher's synthesis is inherently unstable. The religious individual as artist has his own soul, but no manifest work of art. Yet the world of culture requires not just souls but works of art as their objectification. The connection with nature and the universe seems tenuous since there is no adequate public embodiment of this private religiosity. Hegel apparently reads the fourth speech as positing religious communities primarily as passive entities which require the active virtuosity of a preacher-poet for their sustenance and inspiration. The interpretation of the Speeches by Hegel is plausible and has some basis in the text of the work. Yet it overlooks the crucial point that Schleier- macher in fact considers the sermon as the embodiment of a Christian art form. A good sermon, for him, is itself the religious work of art and, against Hegel, it occurs in a publicly manifest church as a worshipping community. For all of Schleiermacher's individualism in the Speeches, the social and communal dimension is a necessary link between the second and fifth speeches. Although the charge of an unwarranted subjectivism is leveled by</page><page sequence="7">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 25 Hegel, the criticism rests on an underlying difference between their ideas of the political embodiment of religious community. For Schleiermacher the church as true religious community has its own reason for existence as an institution of redemption for mankind which, as a matter of principle, is independent from the state (Bigler: 16 1f.). Schleiermacher was later often at odds with the established church of Prussia as well as with Hegel (and his theological colleague Marheineke) on just this point. By contrast, Hegel placed more emphasis on the public role of religion in the context of the educative and moral life of the state. Thus in Hegel's initial reception of the Speeches we can glimpse several levels of critical reaction that will later become more pronounced. For his part we do well to remind ourselves that Schleiermacher never renounced or sought to disassociate himself from the Speeches. He did modify and (in varying degree) revise them on three separate occasions during his lifetime (revised in 1806 and 1821 and reissued in 1831). But rather than renounce them as a "youthful work" Schleiermacher chose to update them by modifying their language and adding explanatory notes which integrated their content into his mature reflection. In his own later scheme for ordering theological studies the Speeches fall into the category of "philosophical theology" (cf. Birkner: 25). But for the present we must remain with their early encounter. Since the early Hegel associates Schleiermacher with Jacobi's philosophy of feeling, we may pause here to examine this association and ask whether it has any basis in fact. Jacobi appears to have made no formal reply to Hegel's attack on his teaching in Faith and Knowledge. Writing to his fellow philosopher in Kiel, K. L. Reinhold, he complains that Hegel has attempted to characterize his work as "romantic" by mentioning Herder and Schleier- macher, whereas Jacobi saw his work as having a more strict philosophic interest (Nicolin: letter #65). Juxtaposition of the Speeches with the thought of Jacobi on the part of Hegel was not without a private reaction from Schleiermacher. Commenting to his lifelong friend, Karl Gustav von Brink- mann, Schleiermacher regrets that Jacobi did not respond to Hegel's remarks (Nicolin: #74). His interest in this matter rests on a desire to know how Jacobi himself sees his work. He tells Brinkmann that he likes Jacobi very much and regrets that this human admiration is not reciprocated. The picture one has of Schleiermacher is that he admires Jacobi and even sees himself as the proper heir (though also the reviser) of a "philosophy of faith." At the time Jacobi was a well-known man of letters (better known than either Hegel or Schleier- macher) who stood in the vanguard of German culture. Schleiermacher's admiration appears never to have slackened in this early period. This is not to say that he sought to make himself into a slavish imitation of Jacobi. He complains at one point about Jacobi's desire for a circle of worshipping disciples (Jiingersucht) and asserts that a desire for true followers creates a situation of intellectual slavery (Nicolin: #77). Schleiermacher nonetheless views Jacobi's synthetic, genial style of philosophizing and of mediating English empiricism (he had written on the philosophy of Hume) to Germany, as something to be admired.</page><page sequence="8">26 Richard Crouter Attesting to this early attitude is the fact that Schleiermacher hoped to dedicate the first edition of his dogmatics (The Christian Faith) to Jacobi, an intent that was revised when Jacobi died in 1819 (Schleiermacher, 1960: xxvi). By 1818 Schleiermacher's self-confidence had emerged so that he could now engage Jacobi directly in an exchange of views on the relationship between faith and philosophy. Hans-Joachim Birkner warns against our making Schleiermacher's much-cited letter of March 30 into a central statement of its writer's view of the relationship between theology and philosophy (Birkner: 35-36). Personal letters ought not to carry the weight of formal expressions of thought. But in view of our interest in his relationship to Jacobi, and Hegel's criticism of him in this regard, the letter deserves further scrutiny. The occasion for the letter to Jacobi was an earlier response in which Jacobi sought to explain his philosophic stance to Schleiermacher. Jacobi sent along part of a letter to K. L. Reinhold in which he claims that he is a pagan with his understanding but a Christian with his feeling, thus swimming between two seas, which he does not wish to unify out of fear of self-deception (Bolli: 116-19). Schleiermacher's rejoinder is of interest because it reveals his thought on this question during the composition of the first edition of his dogmatics. His position criticizes and attempts to avoid the dualism that led Jacobi to say that he is a pagan with his understanding but a Christian with his feeling. Schleiermacher, while seeking to avoid this dualism, also wishes to avoid moving toward philosophical synthesis of a speculative sort in the manner of Hegel. Against Jacobi, he asks, "If your feeling is Christian, how can your understanding interpret in a pagan manner?" Just as feeling and understanding cannot be merged, they also cannot be held apart. Both are on an equal footing as they stand in the field of religion and they make equal claims. Religiosity or piety is a matter of feeling, he writes further, but in contrast, what we call religion, which is always more or less a matter of dogmatics, only arises through the interpretation of understanding which rests on this feeling. To Jacobi's admission that "I am a pagan with my understanding," Schleiermacher asserts, "I am a philosopher with my understanding." For him philosophy is a neutral category and constitutes an interpreting and translating agency for the claims of religious feeling, but not so distinct from this feeling as to be in opposition to it. Even Hegel, in 1802, was aware of distinctions between the two thinkers. He rightly saw that Jacobi orients the capacity of the understanding around material, finite objects, whereas Schleiermacher has a higher conception of the capacity of the understanding to assist in reconciliation with nature and the universe as a whole (1977a: 150-52). To carry our analysis further we can see that Schleiermacher (against the tendency of Hegelian thought) clearly wishes to be conscious of a divine spirit within him that is other than his own reason and yet (against Jacobi) says that he "will never give up seeking out this [spirit] in the deepest depths of the nature of the soul" (Bolli: 117). Schleiermacher admonishes Jacobi not to be alarmed by the apparent duality and oscillation of human experience; such</page><page sequence="9">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 27 oscillations between polarities of our experience are real and present to us but are not to be viewed as pagan and Christian respectively. Foreshadowing the mature formulation of The Christian Faith Schleiermacher writes that there is "an immediate consciousness" out of which both our feelings and our understanding flow. Oscillation is characteristic of finite life. As early as the first speech in the edition of 1799 he argued against the expectation of a false equilibrium between the "two opposing forces" of the universe (1958: 3-5). Now, in 1818, he makes the same point against Jacobi by saying that his dogmatics and his philosophy will never be completed, even though they gradually are defined ever more closely together. Where Jacobi poses as mutually exclusive alternatives, either that we exist with a view of nature as deified or opt for a Socratic-Platonic anthropomorphism, Schleiermacher responds by arguing that even in Jacobi a deification of consciousness occurs. The place where Schleiermacher backs off from acknowledging the necessary involvement of divinity in our experience is where we attempt to define and to conceptualize this involvement. "We cannot conceive of a real idea of the highest being," he writes. "All real philosophy consists only in the insight that this inexpressible truth of the highest essence lies at the basis of all our thinking and experience, and the development of this insight is itself that very thing which, according to my conviction, Plato construed as Dialectic. I don't believe we can get further than this" (Bolli: 119). Although he does not wish to unify the two seas of human experience, Schleiermacher is unlike Jacobi in that he is not pained or troubled by the apparent bifurcation of reality. "Understanding and feeling also remain for me alongside each other, but they touch each other and form a galvanic pile" / 1/. The metaphor of a "galvanic pile" may fall a good deal short of the comprehensive grasp of the self- unfolding divine spirit that lies at the heart of Hegelian dialectic. Yet Schleier- macher, by appealing to such a unity and a synthesizing activity (at some level of human consciousness) and by his avowed interest in following the divine into the very depths and nature of the human soul, takes a position against Jacobi that acknowledges the legitimacy of the fundamental tendency of Hegel. Schleiermacher, it appears, has the same difficulty defining his position over against current philosophies of feeling and intuition that he has in differentiating himself from his romanticizing literary colleagues (cf. Forstman). The fact that he does have this independence of mind, of course, makes his relationship with Hegel all the more interesting and all the more difficult to define. Hegel's Call to Berlin A gymnasium rector in Niirnberg in 1814, Hegel hoped that he might soon obtain a regular university appointment. His friend, an earlier student in the Tiibingen-Stift, Heinrich Paulus, wrote him about the vacant chair of philosophy and the divided mind at Berlin over the appointment of a successor to Fichte (Hoffmeister: #236). Paulus reports to Hegel that de Wette, a popular colleague of Schleiermacher who taught biblical exegesis</page><page sequence="10">28 Richard Crouter and historical theology, favored his old teacher J. F. Fries for the position. The pejorative image of Schleiermacher's work is readily apparent from Paulus's remarks to Hegel: "de Wette has decided in favor of Fries'doctrine of faith and presentiment, but he [Fries] has so much scholarship that it would be hard for him to play in the hands of Schleiermacher's religion without morality and without belief, notwithstanding the fact that presentiment [Ahnen] could be for both of them a comfortable commonplace that they could mutually share." Apart from Fries (whose work is known today mainly through Rudolph Otto), the other chief contender for the chair of philosophy was Hegel, whose reputation, based on the Phenomenology of Spirit and Logic, was already becoming well established. As maneuvering towards the appointment progressed, de Wette wrote to his teacher, Fries, about how his colleague in theology, Philipp Marheineke, was trying to get Hegel invited as Fichte's successor (Nicolin: #176). Meanwhile, Schleiermacher's close associate and eventual successor, August Twesten, wrote to him (June 1815) complaining about the lack of intelligibility of Hegel's Objective Logic (part one of the Logic) (Nicolin: #168). Schleiermacher responds to the observation that Hegel's logic is a piece of legerdemain [ Taschenspielerei] by saying that he has not yet seen it himself but that, judging by reviews, he has a similar impression (Nicolin: #169). Although he was aware of the work of Hegel, the extent to which Schleiermacher ever actually read and studied the key philosophic works is, as far as I can tell, still an open question. When contemplating Hegel as a future colleague in 1815, Schleiermacher had reason to see in him a challenge to his own mode of thought and his sense of the tasks of theological teaching in relation to philosophy. One must take care, however, not to exaggerate the differences between them or their status relative to each other at this moment in their careers. It is difficult to imagine that the remarks Hegel made about the Speeches on Religion were damaging in a sense that would cause Schleiermacher difficulty. Schleiermacher was well aware of the rhetorical nature of that work and had already taken care to revise the work considerably; in a few years he would give it a still more "scientific" cast and relate its teaching directly to his dogmatics. More germane to the Hegel appointment is the fact that, as early as 1811 in his acceptance speech as a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, Schleiermacher expressed deep suspicion of idealistic philosophy (1835b: 3-8). Yet there is no evidence that Schleiermacher questioned its legitimacy so thoroughly that he would want to ban it from the university. Such a stance was contrary to his own liberal conception of the university set forth in his programmatic paper of 1808, at the time of the founding of the University of Berlin /2/. Hence, despite indications that there were serious intellectual differences between himself and Hegel, Schleiermacher, much to the displeasure of his friend and colleague, de Wette, voted to call Hegel to the chair of philosophy (Nicolin: #174). At the same time, there is little doubt that Schleiermacher's action was intended as much to head off Fries's chances as it was from genuine</page><page sequence="11">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 29 enthusiasm for Hegel. Since there was an apparent need for speculative philosophy to be represented at Berlin, Hegel was the most promising candidate for the job. Schleiermacher was at the height of mid-career and continued to attract more and more theological students. His colleagues consisted of de Wette, A. W. Neander in church history, and Marheineke, his colleague in theology who, much to Schleiermacher's disappointment, emerged as a firm champion of Hegel among the theologians. The faculty senate proposed Hegel's name on January 4, 1816, but by October the appointment had not been officially approved. Schleiermacher suggested to a friend that the Minister of Culture would have to bear the blame if they should lose Hegel, adding, "God only knows what would become of our university if it continues to lack philosophers" (Nicolin: 1191). During this time of vacillation on the appointment Hegel received and accepted a call to Heidelberg, so that it was another two years before the move to Berlin took place. In March of 1818 Schleiermacher wrote (with apparent pleasure) to a friend: "Now it's decided, we're getting Hegel and a very strong possibility also of getting A. W. Schlegel. I'm curious to see how both of them will make out" (Nicolin: #256). Schleiermacher mused in private over the imagined relationship between Hegel and A. W. Schlegel; but Schlegel eventually went to Bonn. Meanwhile, others were preoccupied with similar imaginings, but focused on his own relationship with Hegel. Having failed to win the appointment for his old teacher, de Wette wrote to Fries in April 1818: "Hegel is coming here. I'm not afraid of him. I now have too much influence among the students of my faculty, and Schleiermacher certainly eclipses him too much" (Nicolin: #262). The remark is revealing. It illustrates de Wette's concern for his personal security as well as a belief that Schleiermacher would be more than a match for Hegel. In Heidelberg, Hegel's old university, his former colleagues wondered how his relationship with Schleiermacher would develop (Nicolin: #281). The actual stage for the coming together of Hegel and Schleiermacher in Berlin was set as much by the Ministry of Culture under Karl von Altenstein as it was by rival parties within the faculty. Altenstein was aware of a close- knit faculty group that was gathered around Schleiermacher and other colleagues who had been present at the inception of the university. He wished to bring to Berlin a strong philosopher of independent views who would serve as a counterbalance to this group of professors. In this aim Altenstein clearly succeeded. Hegel appears to have known nothing of this underlying administrative plan (Nicolin: #316 and 709). Meanwhile, Schleiermacher's faithful friend Twesten, always a persistent "Hegel-watcher," complained again to Schleiermacher about Hegel's Logic, adding, "What a completely different spirit there is in your dialectic than in this logic!" (Nicolin: #306). Political Differences Published correspondence and the memoirs of contemporaries permit us to glimpse the unfolding drama that began in 1818 with Hegel's arrival in</page><page sequence="12">30 Richard Crouter Berlin, the stronghold of Schleiermacher's theological influence. I have noted that Hegel's early view of the Speeches foreshadows a difference in political attitudes. These issues came almost immediately to a head at a time when Hegel was completing the Philosophy of Right, his major work of political- moral teaching. Politics thus provided the occasion for the first overt rupture of an outwardly cordial (though always official) relationship. It is worth recalling that in their youth both figures directly witnessed the power unleashed by the French Revolution. Each taught briefly at a university which was forcibly closed when overrun by Napoleon (Halle in 1806 and Jena in 1806). Each knew the revolutionary ferment of his age firsthand, felt the lack of national culture and unity of the German people, and sought throughout his life to relate his teaching and writing to the service of German culture. The theme of Hegel and the modern state has been much discussed by scholars and a full airing of it lies beyond our present interests. It will suffice to observe that Hegel must be acquitted of the older charge of being the father of modern political absolutism. It is not my aim to give currency to this charge if I point out that, relatively speaking, Hegel's view of the power and authority of the state and its bearing on religious life is more conservative than Schleier- macher's. Early in his publications Schleiermacher, reflecting his early upbringing among the Moravians, saw that religious and church life needs to have a relative independence in relation to the state. Although his personal confession was Reformed, his teaching on church and state at times approximates a sharply delineated version of Luther's two-realms doctrine. There must be some basis for religious values, as well as for a religious community whose life is inviolable and allowed to freely unfold in relationship with, but not subordinated to, the state. Such themes occur early in his work, are vigorously attested to by passages from the third and fourth speeches, and remain throughout his lifetime. By contrast, Hegel sees religious life more tightly bound up with the state, virtually as the realm of inner meaning and spiritual direction of the nation. If we should try to differentiate them by asking what each thinker takes as the primary community to which his thought is directed, then I believe that the church occupies the place in Schleiermacher that the state eventually assumes for Hegel. The immediate setting for the public rupture of their relationship was the political activity of professors and students in the wake of tendencies towards reaction that followed upon Napoleon's stunning victories. Schleiermacher promoted the far-reaching reforms of Baron von Stein which envisaged eventual representative power in a political assembly under the monarchy, the emancipation of the Jews, and other measures (cf. Bigler). But the reform movement of Stein was short-lived and fell on deaf ears after 1819. Student gatherings of fraternities and gymnastic clubs were suspected of promoting romantic and radical political thinking and rekindling the original impetus of the revolution. In turn, professors who associated with the student movement also came under suspicion. In this setting a situation developed as a result of</page><page sequence="13">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 31 which de Wette, the liberal colleague of Schleiermacher opposed to the call of Hegel, came to be dismissed from the university. In his Philosophy of Right (1821) Hegel, a son of Swabia, criticized the rise of student fraternities in Prussia. He focuses his attack on the philosophy and political activities of Fries, who took part in a student festival on the Wartburg and actively encouraged radical sentiment among students. In his recent analysis of these events Schlomo Avineri writes that Hegel "attempts to point out how a subjectivist philosophy may lead to romantic political terrorism and the loss of any rational criterion for the discussion of public and social life" (119). In order to underscore the point that the German student fraternities were not harmless social clubs, Avineri continues: "The truth of the matter is that in their ideology and actions these fraternities prefigured the most dangerous and hideous aspects of extreme German nationalism. To present their aim as merely agitation for German unification is simple- minded: they were the most chauvinistic element in German society. They excluded foreigners from their ranks, refused to accept Jewish students as members and participated in the antisemitic outbursts in Frankfurt in 1819 . . ." (119). Thus it was not as an alarmist or reactionary that Hegel engaged in criticism of these clubs. In this situation, a member of a Jena fraternity named Karl Sand, who was also a student of theology, murdered the journalist and poet August von Kotzebue, whom the students suspected of being a Russian agent. The case inflamed passions on all sides. What began as a student affair quickly became an affair of state that encompassed the universities. Immediate demands for action against the student movements were heard within the Prussian Court and the educational ministry. As a sympathizer of the student cause (though without wishing to condone an act of murder) the Berlin theologian de Wette wrote a letter of condolence to Sand's mother in which he suggested that Sand's motives were pure. Such were the events in progress as Hegel finished the Philosophy of Right. It was natural for Hegel to take a stand on these events in the preface to that work where he blames both Fries and de Wette for fomenting student extremism and for advocating a romantic and subjectivistic ethic (1952: 5-6 and paragraphs 126, 140; Hoffmeister, II: 218-19). By implication, Schleiermacher also came in for criticism, first, because of his close association with de Wette and the student movement and, second, because of his defense of Friedrich Schlegel's experimental novel, Lucinde, a work that appeared to assault the moral order by claiming that true romantic love may be sufficient grounds for legitimating sexual relations. Although tame by more recent standards, Schlegel's Lucinde is among the first modern books in which a known author reveals his own behavior in the bedroom. Kierkegaard found it quite obscene and distasteful, and I suspect it may have formed part of the material upon which Kierkegaard drew when he conceived "The Diary of the Seducer" in Either/l Or (cf. Hegel, 1952: 263; Kierkegaard: 302-16). Amid this cluster of interrelated issues the main lines of a confrontation between Hegel and Schleiermacher were drawn. In fact, during his Heidelberg</page><page sequence="14">32 Richard Crouter professorship Hegel had been a champion of student clubs. One student even reports that in Berlin Schleiermacher, Hegel, and de Wette were all three present at a student festival where wine-drinking and singing alternated with speeches and vigorous discussion of the Kotzebue affair. On this occasion a young Hegel student took the position that while there would be no raising of their glasses in honor of Sand, one should nonetheless "let evil fall where it shall, only without a dagger" (Nicolin: #295 and 296). The professors are said to have been quite as jubilant as the students. If we judge by his subsequent actions and attitudes, Hegel must have been quite uncomfortable in that setting. In official circles such gatherings were coming increasingly under suspicion. The days of revolutionary fervor were now met with a more forceful hand. For his questionable judgment in the Kotzebue affair the theologian de Wette was dismissed from the faculty by the government (September 1819). A storm of protest ensued with Hegel defending the right of the university to dismiss him on grounds that a professor as a state official can hardly be allowed to condone an act of murder. Hegel insisted, however, that de Wette be permitted to draw a portion of his salary. When this failed to materialize, a number of professors, including Hegel and Schleiermacher, contributed toward de Wette's support during the first year of his dismissal. Differences over the dismissal of de Wette occasioned a noteworthy public exchange between Hegel and Schleiermacher in which Schleiermacher charged his colleague with having shown a lamentable [erbiirmlich] attitude towards de Wette. Sharp words were exchanged on a social occasion. Schleiermacher, realizing he had been intemperate, sent a conciliatory note to Hegel which also contained the address of a good wine merchant (at least one substance they could agree upon as being of the highest significance). Schleiermacher added his hope that they could continue the dispute at the point where it stood before his own harsh words and Hegel's rejoinder were uttered. "For I have too much esteem for you not to want to reach an understanding with you on a topic which is of such great importance in our present situation" (Hoffmeister: #361, cf. #362). In his response, Hegel writes: "I thank you, my esteemed colleague, in the first place for the address of the wine merchant contained in your note of yesterday-as well as for the expression, which, in overcoming a recent unpleasant incident between us, at the same time transmitted the response that arose in my own excitement and which has left me with a decided increase in my admiration of you. As you remark, it is the present importance of the subject which led me to begin an argument at a party, which to be able to continue with you and bring our views into an accommodation can be nothing else than interesting" (Rosenkranz: 326). The formal expressions of cordiality, however, did not translate into a meeting of minds. Moreover, the outburst of hostility signaled their contemporaries that there was little possibility for substantive agreement between them. Among their respective students the divergence of the masters' positions was most acutely felt. Tension between them could hardly go unnoticed. In</page><page sequence="15">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 33 addition to the actual clash of positions taken in their lectures, the university was rife with rumors about their relationship. Writing home in November 1818, Richard Rothe reports that "Hegel is said to be very much down on Schleiermacher, but Schleiermacher is supposed to have provided the immediate occasion" (Nicolin: #309). In government circles and at court there were rumors that Hegel and Schleiermacher came near to a duel during their exchange of words. Report of open hostility between them was sent from as far away as Breslau by one of Schleiermacher's friends. Writing from Weimar after his dismissal, de Wette complains to Schleiermacher about the negative references in Hegel's Philosophy of Right, adding that as far as Fries is concerned, he is sorry that Schleiermacher and other well-intentioned persons have done him an injustice (Nicolin:#332). The tone of his letter suggests that de Wette now expects Schleiermacher to regret having voted in favor of Hegel's appointment. De Wette's early anxiety in regard to the coming of Hegel to Berlin was more than justified by subsequent events. Whatever may have been the personal or intellectual shortcomings of de Wette-it does not seem germane to attempt to estimate them-his dismissal from the theological faculty left Schleiermacher without the support of a valued colleague. When we reflect that the eventual successor to his position was the conservative biblicist Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, it appears that Schleiermacher also emerged on the losing side of the Kotzebue affair. The Academy of Sciences Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences, possibly even more than their political differences, contributed to Hegel's ill will towards him. The exclusion of Hegel from this august group was no momentary affair; its effect was felt throughout his career and tended to freeze his problematic relationship to Schleiermacher by the erection of a significant institutional barrier. As early as 1811, in his acceptance speech before the academy, Schleier- macher formally disassociated himself from speculative philosophy and suggested that the historical-critical approach to philosophy was alone fit to be represented in the academy (1835b: 3-8). At the time of Hegel's arrival in Berlin this sentiment was shared by a majority of academy members. His influential colleague in classical philology, August B6ckh, rested the case against speculative philosophy on two grounds: (1) the nature of speculative philosophy is such that it is more self-contained than other disciplines and thus has no need of collegial work, the fostering of which is the stated purpose of the academy, and (2) where philosophy should be represented in the academy, it can already be represented in the philological and historical disciplines (Harnack: 692-93). In his magisterial history of the academy Adolf von Harnack maintains that the hostility between Hegel and Schleiermacher did not occur until after Hegel's arrival in Berlin and takes pains to point out that Hegel was named Ordinarius in the summer of 1818 at Schleiermacher's behest, who was then</page><page sequence="16">34 Richard Crouter rector. Harnack believes that Schleiermacher's opposition to Hegel's admis- sion to the academy rests more on the earlier stated policy of members (a policy established in the days of Fichte) than on personal antipathy or rivalry. Yet once both were together in Berlin Schleiermacher was firm in his resolve to keep Hegel out of the academy. Whatever motives we may attribute to him, the exclusion of Hegel from so significant a body of scholars was sure to have major repercussions within the faculty. This was especially the case since Altenstein, acting as minister of culture, had assured Hegel of membership in the academy when arranging the call from Heidelberg. Altenstein protested in vain about the exclusion and the formal means of bringing it about by abolishing the philosophical division of an academy which had been honored to have had G. W. Leibniz as its first president. Consistent with the principles invoked against Hegel, Schleiermacher dropped his own membership in the philosophical division and henceforth presented his papers (largely on Greek philosophy, ethics, and New Testament) in the historical and philological sections. He had been flexible on the original appointment, but he drew the line on the question of Hegel's participation in the academy. According to Harnack, "Schleiermacher feared the despotism of Hegelian philosophy and at least the Academy was to be kept free of it" (735). There may indeed be more to the story yet to be uncovered. But it would seem as if an academy of sciences must want to be open to all perspectives in the university if it hopes to fulfill its purposes of contributing to an advancement of learning. One can only imagine the sorts of questions that Hegel would have raised about the dominance of historical-critical and philological inquiry, had he been able to be present on those occasions. From the point of view of Hegel's impact on the university and his following among students his exclusion from the academy had no real effect. In the next decade he engaged in a countermove by founding a scholarly society which published the Journal of the Society for Scientific Criticism (Lenz: 291-312). Although not intended as an alternative to the older, prestigious academy, this organization soon constituted a rival group of scholars (some with dual memberships) with Hegel as its acknowledged leader. Activities of this new scholarly society differed from the academy in two ways. First, it was under the Ministry of Culture rather than the university, and second, it sought to be more active than the academy in promoting scholarly views on questions of importance. By January 1828, the society included Wilhelm von Humboldt, A. W. Schlegel, Goethe, and Hegel's former Heidelberg colleague, the mythologist F. W. Creuzer. Since the society was not university-related, its membership was not restricted to Berlin (cf. Nicolin: #486). When the name of Schleiermacher was proposed for membership, Hegel said that he would withdraw if Schleiermacher were admitted (Nicolin: #486). Such a response was not unexpected in view of Schleiermacher's part in excluding him from the academy. If we ask what light their mutual exclusions throw on the overall relationship between Hegel and Schleiermacher, one point stands out clearly. The rival groups of scholars functioned as formal</page><page sequence="17">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 35 barriers between the two thinkers and were a continuous source of friction. Since persons in Hegel's society were held together by their mutual enthusiasm for Hegelian philosophy, Schleiermacher's suspicion about the imperialism of speculative philosophy was doubtless reinforced. The episode also illustrates that Schleiermacher's natural affinity was with the historians, linguists, and philologists. In his effort to exclude Hegel he appears to have acted in defense of an honorable concept of the university as an open, pluralistic marketplace of competing viewpoints. It is ironic that Schleier- macher's action, and that of the other academy members, erected a barrier that worked against his concept of the university as an open, inclusive, scholarly community. Hegel's Critique of Schleiermacher's Dogmatics Shortly after Hegel's arrival in Berlin, Schleiermacher was earnestly at work on his dogmatic theology [Glaubenslehre/ The Christian Faith], a work intended as a system of Christian teaching for the United Evangelical Church of Prussia. His colleagues de Wette and Marheineke had already published their dogmatics and Schleiermacher's friends in the theological world urged him to get his work into print (Gass: 117, 159-60, 164). Because of the novelty of his treatment, which he himself fully recognized, Schleiermacher fell far behind his original estimates of time needed to complete the project. Over a year elapsed between the publication of parts I and 2 of the first edition, issued in May 1821 and August 1822 / 3/. Publication of part 1 of the Glaubenslehre was the occasion for an impassioned outburst from Hegel which makes their debates over student fraternities and the Berlin academy seem tame by comparison. Hegel was asked by a former student, H. Fr. W. Hinrichs, to write a preface for Hinrich's Religion in Its Inner Relationship to Science; and the resultant preface is one of its writer's strongest polemics (cf. Weiss: 221-44). Hegel waited over a year after being asked to write, apparently in expectation that part 2 of Schleiermacher's dogmatics would soon emerge from the press /4/. Although Hegel's preface does not mention Schleiermacher by name, its target was immediately known from the caustic references to "absolute dependence" and "one who raises Plato to his lips." The preface appeared in May 1822, three months before part 2 of the dogmatics. It does not appear accidental that Hegel first began to lecture on philosophy of religion in April 1821, just before reading the first part of Schleiermacher's dogmatics and while he had the request for a preface to Hinrichs's book in hand. The sequence of events directly connects the inception of his lectures on philosophy of religion to the work of his colleague in theology. Although his earlier works, including the unpublished youthful manuscripts, the Phenomenology of Spirit, and the Encyclopedia, all address the status of religion in relation to philosophic thought, this set of lectures (repeated in differing versions in 1824, 1827, and 1831) was wholly devoted to that subject. We would go too far if we claimed that Schleiermacher's</page><page sequence="18">36 Richard Crouter theology was the actual cause of Hegel's decision to start lecturing on philosophy of religion. I imagine that Hegel would have wished to lecture on religion as a means of rounding out his system even if he had remained at Heidelberg. But his correspondence with friends and the timing of these concerns show how vitally disturbed he was by Schleiermacher's work. He chides Karl Daub (his Heidelberg colleague) as a theologian about the fact that Schleiermacher's dogmatics is believed to be appropriate for the Prussian Church and expresses the hope that Daub and other colleagues would speak directly to Altenstein about the direction of theology in Berlin (Glockner: 249; Hoffmeister: #410). These references show that, in addition to completing the treatment of religion in Hegel's philosophical system, the immediate local significance of his lectures is that they were designed to put what he called "Berlin theology" (meaning theology under the sway of Schleiermacher) out of business. Symbolic of the final rift between the two thinkers is the remark of Hegel in the Hinrichs preface to the effect that if religion is defined as the feeling of absolute dependence, "a dog would be the best Christian for it possesses this in the highest degree and lives mainly in this feeling" (Weiss: 238). This polemical saying has embittered countless Schleiermacher students towards Hegel, beginning in their own day. To compare the consciousness of absolute dependence to an animal feeling seems manifestly unfair as an interpretation of the introductory paragraphs of The Christian Faith. Any careful reader of Schleiermacher knows that the feeling in question presupposes a capacity for self-consciousness that is possessed only by humans. No matter how dependent a dog may feel, it is doubtful whether the ultimacy or finality of any dependence is felt. On the other hand, there is no reason why we must be unduly shocked to find that a rationalist like Hegel can enliven his argument with a polemical stroke. Displays of biting irony and sarcasm have endeared philosophical writers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to many of their readers. The fact that Hegel as a rationalist can occasionally be downright mean and partisan in argument merely indicates that he too is mortal and passionately concerned about the truth of the matter under discussion. In this contest played out before colleagues and students the stakes were running very high. What, then, stood behind this openly hostile, sharp attack of Hegel's? If we look at and attempt to synthesize Hegel's mature objections to Schleier- macher, we can identify the core of his criticism and see those features which irreconcilably set him against his colleague. One can classify Hegel's philo- sophical opponents in one of three camps /5/. There are: (a) those older metaphysicians of dogmatic abstraction who directly identify concepts and things, (b) those who are Kantian in placing strictures on the unifying powers of the intellect-the concepts we have of things are not the things themselves, and (c) those who soar beyond the Kantian limitation of knowledge, but do so illicitly through a flight of mystical intuition and feeling. Summed up by catchwords, Hegel's opponents are philosophical dogmatists, empiricists, and advocates of mystical intuition. In Hegel's mind there was a progression through these three camps in recent thought with each building on and</page><page sequence="19">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 37 attempting to overcome the inherent weaknesses of the preceding school. The third position is generally how he views the thought of Schleiermacher and, to his mind, this position embodied its own weaknesses as well as those of the preceding Kantianism. As best I can make out, Hegel sees Schleiermacher as being too uncritically a Kantian (broadly defined). In his view, Schleier- macher accepts the reduction of knowledge to the realm of finite objects, but then seeks to get beyond this reduction at the level of intuition and feeling. For his part Hegel attempts to get beyond Kant through a more thoroughgoing effort at describing and identifying all the antinomies of thought. Hegel's philosophy of spirit is an attempt to heal the breach between the external world, self-consciousness, and our consciousness of the world. Kant's self- limitation of knowledge is admired for its modesty and clarity, but it has the disadvantage of leaving the realms of nature and human selfhood unintel- ligible. Thus the way is left open for romanticists, poets, mysticizing philo- sophers, and theologians of feeling and intuition to produce an incoherent and arbitrarily unified view of the world. This is Hegel's resounding charge against this third school of contemporary thought where he places Schleier- macher. In their failure of intellectual nerve and inability to overcome Kantianism they all fall victim to an unwarranted arbitrariness of thought and run the risk of being subjective. What Schleiermacher wanted to accomplish in the Speeches on Religion was honorable enough in combating the intellectualism and moralism of Enlightenment views of religion that had persisted beyond the age of the Enlightenment. But his position leaves the problem of knowledge and of the active self-consciousness unresolved. In Schleiermacher reason is one-sidedly understood to consist of the discriminating intellect. Reason has the office of dividing and dissecting while the drive to unify our experience is left in the hands of immediate consciousness and feeling. The price paid for this alleged independence of religion from philosophy is too high for Hegel. Against this view Hegel argues that reason is a ubiquitous and never-ceasing feature of our experience. Even the most basic theological claim of the Christian religion- that man is a sinner in need of redemption-requires a use of reason in an act of self-recognition of one's own being in a state of sin. His point is that reason cannot be systematically excluded from the deepest and holiest moments of our experience. If it is, we are indeed reducing ourselves to something less than human; and the remark about the dog (from the Hinrichs preface) is not then inappropriate. The price paid for immunizing religion to the attack of its cultured despisers is too high. A theology that seems to be invulnerable can be so only at the cost of its own intelligibility. In the end, the paradox of mysticism continues to haunt the work of Schleiermacher. He uses dialectical argument to fend off objections without seeing that this process of argument commits him to tacit positive claims of his own about the office of reason and rationality. He too uses reason systematically and constructively, even when he describes this use in his theology as merely didactic or rhetorical. Another problem which Hegel has with Schleiermacher is the continuous appeal to history and historical experience as if this appeal can cut off</page><page sequence="20">38 Richard Crouter counterargument. Hegel must have seen the first proposition of the dogmatics of 1821 (later moved to proposition 19) as a historicizing of religious truth. In this famous theological definition of dogmatics Schleiermacher writes: "Dogmatic theology is the science which systematizes the doctrine prevalent in a Christian Church at a definite time." Taken literally, the statement sounds like Schleiermacher is willing to take as theologically true the level of opinion prevailing in the church at any given time. In that situation religious truth would be more a matter of sociological research than the science of divine and eternal things. Such practice, if carried out, would reduce the eternal to the level of insight of any given era, be it good, bad, or indifferent. In pointing out these things in the Hinrichs preface, Hegel is himself not in the position of minimizing the importance of history and a historical understanding. On the contrary, his works amply show that historical consciousness plays a prominent role in the developing awareness of truth. We see this in the Hegelian adage that "philosophy is its own time, apprehended in thought," a formulation that appears to parallel Schleiermacher's thesis about theology from the dogmatics. Thus we must inquire further into what separates them on the question of the place of history and historical consciousness. What is lacking in Schleiermacher's teaching about history that is made good in Hegel's? When the question is put this way, it appears that in Hegel's view the entire basis of truth in Schleiermacher appears to be determined by the historical way of knowing. There was no part of Schleiermacher's work available to Hegel (the lectures on hermeneutics and dialectics were never published) in which he could see the canons of truth that operate for Schleier- macher independently of the realm of historical insight. (This is not to imply that Hegel would have been satisfied with those works.) Hegel seems to have sensed that the full problematic of the historical approach to knowing was not fully felt by Schleiermacher, for whom historical insight and eternal truth (e.g., the impact of the Johannine Christ on the life of faith) could still work easily hand in hand. Hegel seems to have been prescient in seeing that the dominant mode of dealing with religion and religious consciousness of the entire modern period would be either that of historical-critical studies with their largely external approach or else a leap inward towards personal confession and intuitionism. As Hegel put it in the Hinrichs preface, modern theologians deal too exclusively with what "spirit has left behind." In the modern period "the products of the earnest efforts of scholarship, of industry, of acumen, etc., are likewise called truth, and an ocean of such truths are brought to light and propagated" (Weiss: 236). Such historical truths are not the truths which satisfy the longing of the human spirit for a wisdom that is not of this world. In saying this Hegel anticipates Kierkegaard's as well as Nietzsche's strong pronouncements against mere historical vantage points which vitiate an encounter with a living truth. For Hegel an uncritical reliance on history or tradition to make the case for religion leads to an untenable historical relativism. If the fortunes of religion rest only or mainly on historical experience and not on a sense of truth</page><page sequence="21">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 39 that transcends history, the modern era will inevitably outgrow the present phase of human religiousness. The peace between reason and revelation, if it is so constructed, is merely a hollow peace. Unlike the synthesis of faith and reason of the medieval schoolmen, this peace is based on a final indifference in which the two sides do not come into substantive contact. In the hands of Schleiermacher the peace and "contract" between philosophy and religion is rhetorical rather than conceptual. For Schleiermacher religion and philosophy share language but talk about different things. Philosophy does not have it in its power to think the thoughts of a transcendent reality; one can only speak of transcendent reality through the life of faith and through an "immediate consciousness of God." For Hegel there is shared thought and an identical divine content for religion and philosophy. They do not merely coexist but mutually need each other for their completion. Another difficulty that Hegel has with Schleiermacher is related to everything said thus far. In his suspicion of the mediation of our experience by thought Schleiermacher makes relatively short shrift of the doctrine of the Trinity. For Hegel, the Trinity was the mirror in Christian language of philosophic truth, virtually the first article of a rational faith in a divinely unfolding dialectic. Because of his emphasis on the immediacy of religious experience Schleiermacher views the Trinity as a secondary articulation of faith, arising more from speculation than from the needs of faith. It is difficult from his perspective to imagine how one would ever attain an immediate feeling of the inner distinctions in the godhead. The doctrine is only treated in the final three propositions of The Christian Faith. The reason for this is that our religious experience and Christian self-consciousness are immediate and prior to the mediating power of thought. When the matter is put this way, we can identify the problem of immediate knowledge as the intellectual core of the differences between Schleiermacher and Hegel. It is a misunderstanding of Hegel to claim, as is sometimes done, that he is against immediacy. This is simply not the case. The transitions of the Logic rest on and give an account of immediacy. The question is whether any reflection on immediacy can recapture the immediate and attain what the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur calls a "second naivete." Hegel is convinced that there is nothing which exists in heaven, in nature, in mind, or in any aspect of our experience, which is not mediated as well as immediate (1969: 68). Immediacy simply cannot stand by itself unmediated. When we talk as if this were the case, we simply create a breach between what our thought posits and refers to and what our thought actually does in its own explication. The split between the object referred to and the thought doing the referral is irrevocable. The very act of pointing to immediacy requires us to say how immediacy is mediated, through what acts of consciousness we have this direct sense of utter dependence. The alternative is to remain mute in the face of one's private experience. This alternative is, for Hegel, as unthinkable for theology as it is for philosophy of religion. Against Schleiermacher Hegel argues that the mind which knows that it has an experience of utter dependence must be a free, independent mind. If our experience is</page><page sequence="22">40 Richard Crouter paradoxical, then the paradoxes of the heart must be taken up into our mind and intellectual experience. Only with an active mind or spirit which is aware of its own moments of dependence can one enter the kingdom of heaven. Postscript In presenting the main lines of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics (preceding section), I have slightly simplified matters in order to get a number of critical issues out in the open. I have not attempted in this paper to formulate a rejoinder, a task which would necessarily draw from the full range of Schleiermacher's work. It is noteworthy that Schleiermacher issued no response. He felt himself to be quite unscathed by the attack, even though in his words "it was not exactly pleasant" /6/. Both thinkers drew a continuous stream of students to Berlin in the decade of the 1820s. Schleiermacher's lectures on "Dialectics" attracted at least as many, and in some semesters more, students than Hegel's "Logic" / 7/. His lectures on philosophical topics did not suffer the fate of an Arthur Schopenhauer, who was unable to attract students alongside of Hegel in the same period. It is painfully obvious that the interrelated lives of these two illustrious Berlin colleagues reveal some ordinary human reactions and sensibilities (as well as prejudices) on both sides of the relationship. By offering a narrative of events I have sought to bring out their fundamental attitudes and the complex, human side of the situation in which they encountered each other's teaching. The tension and poignancy of their struggle were enhanced by the fact that each figure saw himself as the defender of a proper philosophical (and scientific) stance in the university as well as the bearer of an interpretation of the Christian religion that was vitally needed by the age. Hegel's biographer, Karl Rosenkranz, says of the relationship between the two thinkers: "It was fortunate for Berlin that the Hegelian element with its thorough and compartmentalized systematic and its insistence on method stood in the way of the Schleiermacher element with its versatile flexibility. But also for Hegel and his school it was great good fortune that Schleier- macher's scholarship, spirit, wit, presence, and popular power did not let it grow up too quickly and made it take shape gradually" (327). Rosenkranz, who stood close to his teacher Hegel, acknowledges that Schleiermacher was a significant obstacle in the development of the Hegelian school. Schleier- macher was just as unwilling to let Hegel have the final say in philosophical matters as Hegel was unwilling to abandon theology and religious teaching to Schleiermacher. Although we are familiar with the revolt of the later nineteenth century against Hegel, we are insufficiently aware that the revolt was anticipated, if not precipitated, during his lifetime at his own university by a teacher of theology. Schleiermacher is thus the initial harbinger and herald of the revolt against Hegel, whether it is done by Kierkegaard in the name of an existential religiousness or by Marx as a quest for a just social order. To be sure, Schleiermacher had voted to call Hegel to the Berlin professorship, but</page><page sequence="23">Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin 41 really only to block someone else's chances. At the time his attitude was, if we must have speculative philosophy at Berlin, we might as well get someone good.
