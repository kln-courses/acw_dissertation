<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 239 ) NOTES, CHIEFLY CRITICAL, ON THE CLE MENTINE HOMILIES AND THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. REFERRING to my notes on the Clementine Homilies in Hermathena of 1889, I now proceed to give a further instalment, commencing with the documents pre fixed to the Homilies. Epistle of Peter to James, prefixed to the Clementine Homilies. It is not my intention to enter into the question of the historical relation of this Epistle to the so-called Clemen tine literature in general, except it may be in an incidental manner. My concern is specially only with the text itself. Peter, having sent to James the books of his preaching, begs and entreats that they may not be communicated to any Gentile, nor to anyone of their own nation, before trial of his fitness to be a recipient of them. This, he says, was in accordance with the manner in which Moses delivered his instructions to the Seventy Elders, by which means the fruit of safety was up to the present time appa rent. By this means their nation had preserved the same rule of the Monarchy and policy, or manner of life, hitherto, SO as Kara /urjSsva rponov aWwQ (ftpovtlv wto twv iroWa vtvovawv ypwpHjv e^oSevdtjvai Switdivreg.

This he adopted from a marginal note in the Ottobonian MS. The sense is good without this alteration. But in both MSS. for auvp^iDva there is only avptpwva, all the editors having prefixed the negative. I think if any change was required it should have been ataking ra twv ypa&lt;pC&gt;v substantively. But avfi(j&gt;wva itself may be taken adverbially, according to a very frequent usage in these writings, though, of course, the natural tendency is to construe it with ra tuv ypatyCov. But even so, we might translate : ' to attune the sayings of the Scripture so as to be harmonious.' At the commencement of the next section, as printed by all the editors before Lagarde, we read: h&gt;a yovv to o/ioiov kal irap' I'l/xlv ytvr)rai toIq tjibo/ii'iKOvra, iyiuiv aScXipolg Tag (3'i[3\ovg fiov tu&gt;v KripvypaTwy Bog k.t.X. This punctua tion is only to make bad Greek for a supposed better meaning. Lagarde removes the comma from its place as above, and puts it after yiviiTai, and then roTg ifiSo/uriKovTa will be construed with the sequel, as the structure of the sentence suggests. Peter supposes James to have so many of the original Seventy of the Gospels with him as to justify this manner of speaking, or he regards the pres byters of James to hold an analogous position to that of the Seventy Elders of Moses. He proceeds to say, that .some had already disapproved of his own legal preaching, tov i^dpov avQpwirov avo/jiov Tiva ical &lt;p\uapui$rj irpo(jr]Kap.ivoi SiSacFKaXlav. This has been regarded by all as an attack on S. Paul; and an allusion to Gal. ii. n-13 seems to make the reference clear. For he says that some had, even while he still survives, attempted by various interpreta tions to transform his own words to the dissolution of the Law, Kai tpov aiiTOv ovTh) (uev (f&gt;povovvTog, fill ek 7rappr]aiag Se KijpvrraovToe. oirtp ant'ir). He says this is to counteract the Law of God spoken by Moses, and testified to by our Lord</page><page sequence="3">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. 241 in regard to its permanence. And he quotes our Lord's saying in this form : ' the heaven and the earth shall pass away ; one jot, or one tittle, shall not pass away from the Law.' And he adds : ' this he said, 'iva ta vavra ylvtirai.' It is thus the words are given in both MSS.; yet Lagarde has, on his own authority, substituted for 'iva the words tt(hv av. The only motive for this would be to bring the saying into a nearer agreement with the words of the Gospel, £o&gt;e av. But that is the very reason why Lagarde is wrong. In all this literature Peter is supposed to speak before the Gospels were written, and to quote from his own memory. This affords an opportunity, observable in the whole of these writings, of giving the quotations a turn more in accordance with the writer's views. In the present case 'Iva is plainly adopted to enforce the perpetual obliga tion of the Law. The Contestatio. James, having received the books and Epistle, as sembles the presbyters, reads the Epistle to them, and charges them that they are to impart them to none but a good and cautious person, chosen to teach, and being a believer of the circumcision, and not all at once, but by a portion at a time, that the use of the first portion might be approved before the remainder should be given. The recipient is to be proved during not less than six years, and then is to be brought to a river, or fountain of living water, where regeneration takes place, and he is then, not to be adjured, for that is unlawful, but to make an attesta tion, such as they themselves had made, not to sin, when they were regenerated. Though it is said not to be allow able to adjure, we find that subsequently the person making the attestation says, naKtivov vvv o/ivu/xi. In the former place the word is opuiaai. Perhaps some subtle casuistic</page><page sequence="4">242 ON THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND difference was made between these two words, or the kind of oath implied by them. The difference would seem to be, that the one is voluntary, while the person adjured, if he answers at all, answers by the oath administered, and so is obliged to swear. Stephen, s. v. o^vvfiL, quotes from Xenophon, Symp. 4. 10: ovSevog yap bpKiZovrog au o/uvvovrtc, KaXov jut &lt;pciTt tivai,. The attestation is to be made by calling to witness Heaven, earth, water, and air, in which there seems an imitation of the so-called Orphic oath, which I quote below.1 He is to impart the books to nobody, neither having written nor given them written, nor giving them to a writer, neither himself, nor by another, nor by any management, craft, or contrivance, rj ajusAw? &lt;pv\a&lt;Tau&gt;v, rj tiQCjv, rj v6vwv, or by any other manner or invention im parting them to another. Here both MSS. and a fragment have the word tiOmv : the Ottob. MS. is as above ; and the Parisian adds in the margin to vevwv prima manu, voOtvtov. Cotelerius prints j; ti Owv, which does not mend matters. Leclerc proposed rj TrpoaTiOnG rj voOtvuv, which Dressel rightly says is a tautology, and irpoaTtOuQ is too large a word to substitute. Whether we accept voOtviuv or not, we must either retain nOolv, or put something in its place. If we retain it, we should perhaps read kat, instead of rj, between it and vtvwv, ' laying it down and nodding,' as a hint that it might be looked at. As a possible substitute, one might suggest n'AAov, 'vellens': cf. Hor. Sat. i. 9, 63-4: ■vellere coepi—nutans. In a later part of the attestation the person who makes it says, that if he should adopt the supposition of another 1 Nal /X7]V adavaToov yevv^Topas alev 46uras, Udp Kal vdoop, yaiap re Kal ovpavbv yde ffc\'fiprip, *HeAi6v Te, (pavrjra jxeyap, Kal vvKra /xc\cuvav» See Gesner's Orpheus: Lips. 1764, p. 364.</page><page sequence="5">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THE31. 243 God, tic trlpnv Oeov vwovoiav ytvMfiai, I.e. tripov, not aXXov, a second God, he now swears by him, whether he exists or does not exist. The theory of Hilgenfeld and Lehmann is that this Epistle belongs to an earlier period than that of the Homilies, except so far as these embody portions of the supposed earlier Ki'ipvypa Uirpov, which the Epistle was intended to accompany. The oath just mentioned plainly points to the existence of the Marcionite heresy at the time the Epistle was written; while these authors assign the date of the Homilies to a period soon after the rise of that heresy, to counteract which was plainly a main part of their scope. If they are of different author ship, the interval between them could not have been con siderable. Epistle of Clement to James. Prefixed to the Homilies is the Epistle of Clement, in which he informs James of the death of Peter, of his own ordination by Peter as his successor in the Bishopric of Rome, and how Peter had desired him to send an account of his own history, including his early life, his inter course with Peter, and the occasion of Peter's martyrdom. Having mentioned this latter event, he says that shortly before, having assembled the brethren, Peter suddenly took him by the hand, and declared his intention of making Clement his successor. In mentioning the death of Peter, he speaks of him as rraipwg Sripoaiq £7rt rov evitrrioTog Trovripov rov taopevov ayatiov oA(j» Tiji Kotrptf) pr^vvrraQ (3a&lt;riXta. T.he resemblance of these words to Gal. i. 4, ek tov alwvog tov £i&gt;EOT(I&gt;roe noviipov, is plain enough. In the second Epitome the word alwvog is added after irovripov in Clement's Epistle. It appears to have been in the copy used by Rufinus, and in an extract in the Parisian Codex, known as 804. But this may have arisen from reminiscence of S. Paul's words; while</page><page sequence="6">244 ON THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND fiamXtwQ, understood, would fall in with the theory deve loped in the Homilies, that the present and future ages were assigned to two rulers, the present to the evil, and the future to the good and righteous king. Whichever we adopt, the words are a plain instance of the way in which we find that, notwithstanding a careful ignoring of S. Paul, the writer's mind was imbued with Pauline ideas, and his phraseology with Pauline ways of speaking, which betray either a personal familiarity with the Pauline Epistles, or else with a community that had imbibed these ideas, and adopted a religious dialect founded on such familiarity. Lagarde gives a very copious index of such coincidences, and I have been able to add very many more. They are often mere echoes, and would have no significance singly; but their frequency gives them a significance they would not otherwise always have. It is remarkable also, that the number of such allusions, echoes, and reminiscences derived from the Epistles to the Corinthians are quite equal in number to those from all the other Pauline writings with the Epistle to the Hebrews. This would seem to indicate some special relation of the writer to the Church in Corinth, where, from constant public reading, the Epistles to that Church would be most familiar. The well-known fact that Clement's genuine Epistle to that Church was constantly read there in public would natu rally make the writer desirous of attaching the name and authority of Clement to his own doctrinal views. The Epistle to the Galatians comes next to those to the Corinthians in this respect, but the allusions to it are frequently of a controversial nature, as might have been expected. Peter is then related to have made a discourse on the duties of bishops and the Christian ministry in general, and then of the laity in respect to the ministry. In the course of this discourse he compares the Church to a great</page><page sequence="7">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 245 ship carrying men of various regions to settle in some city of a good kingdom. The master is God; the pilot, Christ; the watch at the prow, the bishop ; the mariners are the presbyters; the side-officers, the deacons; the crew-gatherers, the catechists ; the passengers, the multi tude of the brethren ; the world is the deep; contrary winds are temptations; persecutions and afflictions are like the heavier waves, rpiKvplaig. Then we read: ra Se cnroyeia tiuv )(ci/uappu&gt;v Kai rd (pvm'ipaTa raic nov irXavu)v Kai tCjv \pevSoirpo(f)riTO)v oniX'iati;. The Parisian MS. has anoyta. The want of understanding this passage has given rise to great perplexity. The Latin has—' ex continente venientes torrentes,' which are no cause of danger at all to naviga tion. Wieseler proposes ra arroyeia tQ&gt;v \nptpiwv Kaprspa (pvaripara, the off-shore blasts of wintry times. But this grand alteration absurdly reckons amongst the dangers of the sea that which, of all kinds of storm, is the least dreaded by mariners, an off-shore storm, where we should expect to find the opposite. No change is required if we only understand the words. The airoyua tHjv x^puppiiiv are not storms at all, but the shoals brought down from the land by the torrents which rush from the hills, and pro duce shoals in creeks, and bars to harbours. And the &lt;pvtyrifxara are not winds at all, but the swellings of the sea, ground swells, which cover the shoals, and betray the mariner by the appearance of deep water. It is this deceitfulness which forms the point of the comparison with religious deceivers and false prophets. By their pre tences and semblance of truth they beguile the unthinking to their destruction. There may also be an allusion in &lt;j&gt;varipaTa to the boastfulness and swelling words of the false teachers, which may be compared with the vntpoyKa paraiOTriToc (jtOeyyopevoi BtAeaZovatv of 2 Peter, ii. 18. Having compared the earthly rulers that threaten the brethren to projecting rocks and rough places, he then</page><page sequence="8">246 ON TIIE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND says : SiOaXaaaot Ss kcu 0ijpta&gt;§£(e tottoi ro7g aXoy'iaroiQ koi evSoia£ov&lt;n Trcpi tmv rijc aXriOtiag irrayyiXfiaruiv. Wieseler expends some needless learning on the word SiOaXawroi, the meaning of which here is plainly the confluence of two seas, which are supposed to make their place of meeting O^pidiSrig. He does not like what he supposes to be the meaning of this word, savage, and he proposes to read OivwSeiq, which would mean having sandy beaches. Nothing could be weaker than this as expressive of any kind of danger to mariners. A good dictionary would show that OtipiuiSriQ, when applied to the sea, does not mean fierce or savage, but abounding with marine ani mals, such as seals, porpoises, sharks, and the like, which the confluence of the waters is supposed to bring together. The stupidity of many of these would correspond to aXoyla roig, and the diOaXaaaoi to the ivSoiaZovai. Here too all that is wanted is to understand the writer's meaning. No change of text is required. In further pursuit of this similitude, we are told that hypocrites are pirates; sea sickness and giddiness, tartarean whirlpools, murderous dashings on rocks, and deadly wreckings are the various kinds of sins. To these comparisons is then subjoined the needful advice to the several classes on board the ship. In the course of this he bids the crew-gatherers to put the men in mind of their reward or hire. These, as we saw, are the catechists, who gather men into the Church. The word used is vavaroXoyoi. This should plainly be vavro Xoyoi. The error arises from the similarity to the genuine word vavaroXoQ. Peter, having finished his discourse, ordained Clement to be his successor, and commended him to the community of the Roman Church. He then desired Clement that, after his decease, he should send to James an account of his death, of Clement's own history down to the early struggles in his mind on the subject of religion, and of all</page><page sequence="9">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO T11E31. 247 his intercourse with Peter as a hearer of his discourses and a witness of his acts. All this was to be drawn up in the form of an epitome, which Clement announces his intention of sending, and which constitutes the materials of the succeeding Homilies. This he entitles ' Clement's Epitome of the Preachings of Peter on his Journeys.' THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES. Homily x. This Homily begins with an account of Clement's early life, his mental struggles on religious questions ; the arrival in Rome of a rumour of the appearance in Judaea of a great religious teacher, working miracles, and pro mising salvation to those who would be taught by him; and then the subsequent arrival of a seller of sheets, or sails, who openly preached about this rumoured deliverer. One can scarcely help thinking that this was suggested by the Aquila of the Acts of the Apostles, who, having come to Corinth from Italy, there met with S. Paul, and wrought with him, as they were of one trade. By his announcement of the Saviour, Clement is determined to go to Judaea, which he does after some delay. He is driven by adverse winds to Alexandria, and there meets with Barnabas, who soon afterwards goes to Csesarea, whither he is followed by Clement, who is there introduced by Barnabas to S. Peter, and becomes his constant follower. To give a full account of this most interesting narrative would, however, be beyond the scope of these Papers. I shall only make a general remark on this subject, some particulars of which will turn up, however, in the subse quent notes. I cannot but think that this whole account of Clement's early religious struggles was suggested to the writer by VOL. vii. S</page><page sequence="10">248 ON TEE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND Justin Martyr's account of his own early life. Not that there is any direct imitation, for the two narratives are sufficiently distinct to negative any charge of special imitation. I only speak of the general conception of the narrative of Clement's early struggles. I shall notice by-and-by one particular point of contact. But here I shall endeavour to show that the author was acquainted with Justin's writings. One main design of the writer of the Homilies was to counteract the Marcionite heresy, as represented by Simon Magus. Now, we learn from Irenaeus that Justin wrote a book against Marcion, from which Irenaeus gives us an extract. In Adv. Haer. iv. 14, he says : ' Et bene Justinus in eo libroqui est ad Marcionem ait: Quoniam ipsi quoque Domino non credidissem alterum Deum annuncianti prae ter fabricatorem et factorem et nutritorem nostrum.' The original Greek of this sentence has been preserved by Eusebius, Eccl. Hist. iv. 17 : Kai koAwc lovarivoQ Iv rtfi irpbg MapKiwva avvTaypan &lt;pr)cr[v, on avrtji Kvplqt oi)S' av Lirt'ioOriv aAAov Otov KarayytXovri 7rapa tov Sripiovpyov. How much of the sequel of this sentence belongs to Justin, or whether it is all from Irenaeus himself, may be a question of doubt. But the quotation is made in connexion with the text, ' No man knoweth the Father, but the Son,' &amp;c., as misapplied by the Marcionites. And at the close of the paragraph, the text is again repeated, and followed by the words : ' This is the Creator of heaven and earth, as is shown from His discourses, and not that false father that has been invented by Marcion, or Valentinus, or Basilides, or Carpocrates, or Simon, or the other falsely-called Gnos tics.' Now, if we turn to the latter part of Homily XVIII., we shall find that Simon had been urging this text in the Marcionite way of understanding it, and that Peter, having given his own view of it, and Simon having, in affected horror at what Peter said, respecting the need of our</page><page sequence="11">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 249 being ' approved money-changers,' so as to discern the truth in the Scriptures from what was falsely said for our trial, Peter recalls him, and bids him hear one word before he goes (ch. 22) : ' I know how you were then shocked when you heard me say, Whoever it be that says anything against the God that created the world, I do not believe him. Hear now something still greater. If, in reality, the God that created the world were such in His sentiment as the Scriptures misrepresent Him, even if in anyother way whatever He is incomparably evil, as neither the Scriptures have been able to say, nor any other is able even to imagine, in like manner I shall not cease to worship Him alone and to do His will. For I would have you know, and be persuaded, that he who has no love for his own Creator can neither ever have love to another.' One cannot fail to see that all this is an enlarged imitation of what Irenseus gives us from Justin's book against Marcion. The text from the Gospels, the mention of Simon in con nexion with the distinction between the Creator and the Supreme God in the passage of Irenseus, and the quota tion of Justin's own words as given above, seems to leave no doubt on the subject, unless we suppose that the writer of the Homilies followed, not Justin himself directly, but the above-quoted passage of Irenseus. Considering the later date of Irenseus, the more probable supposition is that Justin himself was directly imitated. The point of contact between Justin's account of his religious perplexi ties and that of Clement's will turn up before long in a subsequent note. Homily i. i. Amongst the questions which Clement says perplexed him in his early days is the following: ku\ apa ttots ytyovtv 6 KoafioQ, Ka\ 7T(&gt;6 tov yevtaOai t'i apa i)v. ti yap ijv aid, Kal S 2</page><page sequence="12">250 ON TIIE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND tarai' el St ye-yovcv icai XvOrjcrtTat. Kai fitra Avaiv t'i apa tarai 7raXiv, it firj icai criyri icai Xi'iOri; In the second clause of this the editions follow the Parisian MS., t! apa r/v; but the Ottobon. MS. has erog instead of apa. The word eroe is not a likely mistake for apa, but apa would be very apt to be adopted in consequence of the subsequent rl apa iarai. The word Iroc. therefore, probably represents a genuine reading, in, ' was there anything as yet, or at all' ? Homily i. 3. In his perplexity Clement resorted to the schools of the philosophers. There he found nothing but refutations and establishments of dogmas, strifes, and contentions, artifices of syllogisms and inventions of lemmas. He per ceived that hypotheses were supposed true or false accord ing to those who advocated them, kcu ovk wq ix°v(nv a\&gt;)6uac &lt;j&gt;n(vovTai, are not shown that they have truth. This is rather a harsh construction. I should prefer e^oufrat. Having found, at last, that a comprehension is formed, not according to the hypotheses advocated, nAXa napa tov? iKSiKovvrag ai §o£ai cnro^aivovTat, he was then bewildered. Here the MSS. have airoQipovrai, which seems to be better than Cotelerius's substitute. Instead of a comprehension of the hypothesis, opinions are brought away on the authority of their advocates. Now, here we have the point of contact with Justin to which I referred above. Justin tells us, Tryph. ii., that those who first touched on philosophy, and were on that account in repute, were followed, on account of their ascetic prac tices and novel doctrines, without any investigation con cerning their truth; ravra a\t]6ij vofx'ioai a naoa tov SiSamcaXov iKao-Toe 'i/iaOev. Then also those that afterwards handed down such-and-such doctrines were called after the origi nal authors of the doctrines. The imitation of this in the Homily seems very probable. The similarity is evident.</page><page sequence="13">T1IE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. 251 Homily i. 8. While Clement is in the perplexity just mentioned a rumour pervaded Rome of a great worker of miracles in Judsea, who preached the kingdom of the everlasting God. This was in the spring of the year, and in the autumn of the same year, when already companies had begun to assemble for the purpose of inquiry as to the person and the teaching of this rumoured Jewish teacher, a stranger, in a subsequent Homily described as a seller of sheets, or sails, publicly proclaimed that the Son of God had ap peared in Judsea, preaching eternal life to all who desired to obtain it. Clement accordingly determined to go to Judaea, and make inquiry for himself. He sets about settling his affairs, but finds great delay in disentangling them. He then says, as the text is printed by Lagarde: rifpap -yovv avvvortauQ uSlirore rrjv tuv /3tov &lt;pvcriv on iXiriSi t/LnrXtKOJV rove tnrtvSuvTag ivtSptvei, ov fii)v aXXa KO.I OV 7TOT6 el(TtK\a7rr)v \povov tXiricnv Sovuvfitvog, kat ort ovto'g atr^oXou fitvoi oi avOptoTToi airoOvriiTKOfxev, he leaves everything just as it was, and sets out for Judsea. There are two great diffi culties in this passage:—First, ifxirXtKoov is only a conjecture of Leclerc, and it may be dismissed, because entangling with hope is a very improbable idea. Cotelerius prints tKirXUtDv, which is equally unintelligible. Dressel prints tKnXoKwv from O; and Lagarde, with some doubt, says it is the reading of both MSS. But in this form it is also unin telligible. Wieseler would read kicXETrTwv, or hacXoiriov, as suggested by the dasKXanviv in the next clause. But this change is not necessary. All that is needed is to divide the ennXoKwv of the MSS. into two words, ek ttXokuv, and to construe it with MrtvSovTag; ' the business of life beguiles with hope those who are hastening out of entanglements.' Then, in the next clause, the word £i&lt;TtKXd7rr|i&gt; seems an</page><page sequence="14">252 ON TIIE CLEMENTINE IIOMILIES AND impossible expression. Wieseler would read t££icAa7niv. Here, too, I think all that is necessary is to divide tiatK\a 7ri]v into two words, reading ug for tig, ' considering how much time I, one, have been robbed of, and that thus busied we men are dying off.' Here the tig would stand in opposition to men in general—' I, for one, have been robbed of much time, and we are all dying off.' These proposed variations seem to give a good sense, with the least possible alteration of the text of the MSS. Homily i. io. Clement, having sailed for Judaea, is carried by contrary winds to Alexandria. There he hears of Barnabas, who was preaching, the rumoured deliverer, and Clement goes to hear him. When he is mocked by the philosophers, and assailed with silly questions, Barnabas says :—' We have only a commandment to tell you the words and wonderful works of Him that sent us, and instead of logical demonstration, we offer you many witnesses,' rw tZ, v/niov iraptcTTiljrwv noWovg, tov iy&lt;2&gt; ra aSrj ptfivrtfiai, uie t/xjjvxovg tiKOvag licavag fiaprvpiag. Here Schwegler would transpose the article, and read vfiuv rwv iraptarooruiv. This would be an improvement, but is scarcely necessary. But Wieseler says, Mea quidem sententia verba eZ, Ifiwv adnotata erant ad verba rwv ■KaptaruTwv a lectore aliquo, significaturo, non esse cogitandum de iis qui orationibus et miraculis Christi interfuissent, sed de iis, qui inter auditores Barnabse essent. Nothing could be more un called for than this suggestion. Whether with or without v/xwv, it is evident that persons standing by who had seen our Lord's miracles were intended, and Barnabas is represented as recognizing them. These are not like lifeless statues testifying to past events, but living statues, ample testimonies. Similarly Eulogius, a writer of the sixth cen</page><page sequence="15">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 253 tury (apud Phot. Bibliothec. cclxxx. p. 1620), describes the man that was resuscitated by touching the bones of Elisha as ifj.\pv\OQ Kal cnroSei^ic toic rtov aylwv [oarioiQ r] irpo TtOiLntvoQ. Just before, at the close of the preceding chapter, Clement says that Barnabas ' offered many witnesses of the miracles and words related by him, even out of the very crowd that was standing by.' Clement himself makes a speech in favour of Barnabas, and at last, when he is buffeted by the mob, Clement brings him to his own lodgings. After a short time Barnabas says he is in haste to Judaea, to keep a festival of the Jews. Clement would go with him, only he has some delay to recover a debt, but will follow him at once. This he does, without waiting to finish his business, and at last arrives at Caesarea, where he finds Barnabas, and is at once introduced to Peter, who welcomes and embraces him, having learned his history from Barnabas. A conversation then ensues, and Peter discourses to him about the true prophet, Clement giving a brief sketch of this discourse. Homily i. 18. In this chapter we find Peter saying, as printed by Lagarde: roiavra pvpia icaicd, Hjmrip Kcnrvov ttAjjOoq, wq iva oikov oIkovvtci top kov/uov, Tutv tvSodsv oIkovvtwv avSpiov eirido Xwaavra rag opacruQ ovk e'lacrtv ctuaf3\t\pavra£ . . . yvojpioai. Both MSS. have tmdoMoaav; but Lagarde has borrowed ra from the rag following. He adds rightly that the ohoiivra is still corrupt. I think the original reading must have been die iva OIKOV ovra tov Koafiov tHiv evSodev oIkovvtwv. The comma after Koapov should be removed, and oikov be made the accusative after o'ikovvtwv. The rendering would then be : ' Dimming the eyes of the men within, inhabiting as it were one house, namely, the world.' We can well understand how, from the oIkov preceding ovra, the latter</page><page sequence="16">254 ON THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND would have become oiKovvra. Another remedy would be to read oikovvtwv for ohcovvra, and then to omit oikouvtwv afterwards as a vain repetition caught by the eye from the preceding word. In either case we might let the iiriOoXw aav of the MSS. remain, without adding the plural affix, as it might then agree with irXijOog, the existence of olkovvtci being the reason for making it plural. In the next sentence we are told it is therefore neces sary that the lovers of truth within should cry out with all their might, that some one, svtoq wv tov o'lkov, should come and open the door. This manuscript reading Ivroc is so absurdly incorrect that Schwegler first proposed to read Iktoq, and Lagarde has adopted this in his text. The Recognitions, i. 15, have ' velut fumus quidam immensus universam mundi hujus domum replevit, et habitantibus intrinsecus intuendi conditorem suum aspec tum liberum non dedit.' And then, 'auxilium invocent ejus, quem solum domus fumo repleta non claudit.' Homily i. 20. Clement, in this chapter addressing James, says of this discourse, just spoken of, as an ordinary reader would suppose : TrXrjv ypdipag tov 7repi Trpotpi'irov Aoyov aiirou KeXev aavroQ, and K airraps'iaQ Ttjg ^rpaTwvog, SiaTTifirpOrivai 001 tirolr)(rev tov to/hov. This passage is grammatically incor rect and untranslateable. It suits the theory of Hilgenfeld and Lehmann to suppose that the discourse about the true prophet here meant was not that now mentioned, which one would naturally think, but some previous discourse which Peter had, on a former occasion, sent to James. Accordingly, they propose to omit the words avrov KtXtvcravTOQ as an interpolation of a scribe. For this there could be no possible temptation, as the sentence without these words would be plain enough. I submit,</page><page sequence="17">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. 255 that it is not justifiable to omit so considerable an expres sion, merely to sustain a theory, contrary to the plain tendency of the narrative, if a much slighter variation will make the passage grammatically correct. This can be done by reading ypaifjai for ypa^/at;. All will be then clear. 'But he, having commanded to write the discourse con cerning the true prophet (namely, the discourse that Clement had just described), he caused it to be sent to thee.' This manner of construction, in which the subject of a sentence appears as a genitive absolute, and is' then followed by a personal verb, is well known. It appears in Matt. i. 18, with a clause intervening, is common in the Shepherd of Hermas, and, indeed, is quite familiar. We have it in an inverted form in the fifth chapter of this Homily, koi ndaw . . . ipov (OC irtpi irpayparoQ tivoq irvvtiavo juivov. Also we find in a direct form in ch. 15, imfSavToc Se pov ttiq K°' £ev(av 6r)povptvov, 'tpaOov, k.t.A. Clement assigns in the above passage, as a reason for only giving an abstract of the discourse Peter had made to himself respecting the true prophet, that it had been already sent by Peter to James, having been written out by his desire. Peter is now satisfied that Clement is convinced on this subject, and Clement assures him, that even if Peter himself were to bid him revolt from the true prophet he would not be tempted to do so. That the avrov KeAtvaavroi- existed in the copy of this passage used by the writer of the Recognitions is evident, as also that it was Clement who wrote out the discourse intended, and that it was what the abstract given by both Homilies and Recognitions epitomizes, and not some previous writing transmitted by Peter, will be plain from the words of the Recognitions, 4 Unde jubente eo, ea quae ad me locutus est, in ordinem redigens, librum de vero propheta conscripsi, eumque de Caesarea ad te, ipso jubente transmisi.' And it will be observed that here</page><page sequence="18">256 ON THE CLEMENTINE IIOMILIES AND Clement makes himself the transmitter of that document. Dressel, leaving the y/jaipac of the Homily stand, proposes, in accordance with the Recognitions, to read iTvo'u]&lt;ja. But then in the next clause, where it is said of Peter, 7rapa &lt;xou tvroXrjv 'exsiv tlirvv, it is necessary, as Dressel proposes, to read uttovtoc. To read, as I have proposed, ypaipai for 7paipag is a far less alteration of the existing text, and therefore to be preferred. And we may well suppose that Rufinus, who was by no means a literal translator, gives the sense of the passage, whatever reading he may have had before him. It is plain he understood Clement to have been the writer, and the writing to have been the very discourse just made to him by Peter, of which he has given us only an abstract in the Homily. Homily ii. i. Clement is represented in this chapter as giving the names of Peter's companions, who were, he says, sixteen in number, from which he excludes himself, no doubt as he was a comparative stranger, and not yet baptized. The names are given in pairs, and six of them are clearly New Testament personages. In the several pairs, where only one is a New Testament person, his name is put first. The first thing that seems strange is the apparent ab sence of Barnabas. He was with them the previous night, and it was he that introduced Clement. It would seem to me that the Joseph mentioned as first of the second pair is meant for Barnabas. Joseph is the approved reading of his name in Acts, iv. 36. If we now turn to the Recogni tions, we have in ii. 1, a list of names, in all said to be thirteen. This number is made up by reckoning Peter himself, Phineas, and Nicodemus, not mentioned in the Homily, as well as Nicetas, Aquila, and Clement. Again, iii. 68, we have the same names, twelve in all, excluding</page><page sequence="19">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. 257 Peter. Peter then separates four of these—Zacchseus to be Bishop of Csesarea, and Clement, Nicetas, and Aquila to be his personal attendants, and then, to make out twelve for general purposes, he adds four, Benjamin, the son of Saba, who is in the list of the Homily as the son of Safra; and Ananias, the son of Safra, who is a Jamnite in the Homily; Zacharias, a builder, and one Rubelus, called a brother of Zacchseus, but who appears in the Homily under the name of Geroublius, not as his brother, but as a builder in conjunction with Zacharias. These four names, added to the previous twelve, make sixteen in all. But then Clement is included, while he is excluded from the list of sixteen in the Homily. Thus we have these names in the Recognitions, not in the Homily list, while we have in the latter Thomas the twin, y£neas, and Angaeus, a Jamnite, not in the former. It is plain from all this that the Homily does not follow the Recognitions in this list, nor the Recognitions the Homily, nor both some common document. So far they are quite independent. Having thus established the mutual independence of the two lists, we may turn to the Rubelus of the Recogni tions, and the Geroublius of the Homily. This latter is certainly an odd and improbable name, but it appears not only in the Homilies, but in the older epitome, with this difference, that in the MS. of Cotelerius of the Homilies it begins with X, instead of r. This form of the name appears therefore very ancient, and I can hardly doubt that the Rubelus of the Recognitions was a guess of Rufinus to make an intelligible name out of some cor rupted form. The editors of the Homilies have, no doubt, been led to follow Rufinus by reading TcpovfiXioQ as -ye 'Povfit\oQ; but I think it may safely be said, that a particle so significant in its proper use, and so entirely out of place here, was never used by the writer of the Homilies, and Lagarde therefore makes it re. Cotelerius,</page><page sequence="20">258 ON TEE CLEMENTINE IIOMILIES AND Apost. Const, vi. 3, where the Rubenites, Poi&gt;j3iji&gt;tVai, are mentioned, gives a various reading, 'Pouj3ijXfrai. The tendency to bring in New Testament personages may be illustrated by the seller of sheets or sails whom Clement, Horn. v. 23, mentions as having preached at Rome, and whom we might identify with the Aquila of the Acts, who, having come from Italy, as he was of the same trade as S. Paul, wrought with him at Corinth, Acts, xix. 2. Homily ii. 15. There is a passage in this chapter which is attended with some difficulty. It is thus given in Dressel's text—Bia TOVTO Ot IV Tfjl KOtT/Mf) TOVTIf) TTpOtyriTai ETTO/JIVWQ (Ilf TOV fisWoVTOQ alwvog ovrec viol, avOpwTrtiJV tt)v yvwmv 'i\ovreg, tirtp\ovTat. This, though translateable, does not give a satisfactory sense. First of all, the ot after Sta tovto is out of place. The writer plainly did not mean to distinguish prophets in this world from any supposed prophets in the world to come, and he as plainly does not mean the Gentile prophets, as distinguished from the true, of whom he is speaking as supervening on the former ignorance. The article which Dressel adopted from O is therefore rightly omitted by Lagarde. Instead of otojuevwc O has iiropsvoi; but it makes no material difference which we adopt. For the contraction av&lt;»&gt;v, the usual form in the MSS. for avOpwttojv, Cotelerius suggests to read alwvlwv, having the knowledge of eternal things, which seems very unmeaning, just after saying that they were the sons of the world to come. Dressel then proposes a transposition of words, which is a violent proceeding. He would read ' as the sons of men,' which is here quite unmeaning. We naturally expect a previous member of the syzygy to which the true prophets succeed, but of which the text, as it exists, gives us no</page><page sequence="21">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO THEM. 259 mention. They supervene, but we are not told on what. This is supplied by reading toiq avOpioTrojv rr)v yvwmv s\ovcti. ' The present world is feminine, as a mother of children— bringing forth souls : the world to come is masculine, as a father welcoming his own children. Hence in this world prophets following, as being sons of the world that is to be hereafter, supervene on those that have the knowledge of men,' i. e. on those whose knowledge is merely human, such as men can acquire for themselves without Divine revelation. Homily ii. 17. This chapter begins thus, as printed by Dressel: 6/jioIwq tj yap irpog rbv 'HXiav rrv^vyla otytiXovaa sXOuv SKOvrra cnrt lie 'ercpnv Kaipov, aAAore tvKalpwg avrrjv anoXaveiv (invXevrrapsvr}. Here for yao Wieseler proposes to read yc, which seems to be quite out of place. Lagarde reads yap i], instead of the rj yap of P. This is plainly wrong, for it necessitates connecting o^uoi'wc with the words im mediately following, which, however, note a difference instead of similarity. What is needed is a pause after oho'imq, the 17 yap then explaining the reason for pausing— ' In like manner, for the syzygy relating to Elias, when it ought to have come, was designedly left off for a season ; at another time in good season designing to resume itself.' We should thus connect opo'iwQ with aAAore, or with the entire passage, but not with 17 yap. The syzygy is sus pended in the case of Elias until he appears again in the person of John the Baptist. Hence the writer proceeds : ' therefore also he that was amongst those born of women came first, then He that was amongst the sons of men came second.' It will be seen that the pause after opolwe makes all quite clear. In translating I have followed the reading airoXajiuv, adopted without remark by Lagarde,</page><page sequence="22">260 ON THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND and therefore possibly that of both MSS., instead of the anoXaveiv which Dressel adopts as the reading of O. Fol lowing this latter reading, Wieseler would read avrije. If we are to make a change, it would be better to let avtt'iv stand as it is, and to read cvkaipiag for tvKalpwQ, and to translate ' designing that it should enjoy a fit season at another time.' For either reading I think avrriv would be better than avri) v. Homily ii. 19. The last sentence, of the Syrophenician woman, is manifestly incorrect—ov yap av Wvitcrjv ovrrav Kal E7ri T&gt;j avrij TToXireia fisvovaav, 6 tt)v apxwv Sia to firj ttZeTvai depaniveiv (t&gt;c iOviKriv, Wvlkrjv fit'ivaaav iOcpairtvev. W^ieseler does not know well how to correct this, but with his love of great altera tions suggests to read jur/ avvtrac (sc. to Ofpairevuv). I leave it to himself to make what sense he can out of the passage thus altered. There is nothing needed to make good sense but to remove the comma before o rijv apx^v&gt; ar,d to reject the article o. Then we have good sense, though condemnable iteration. ' For as being an ethnic, and re maining in the same way of living, He would not have cured her at all, having remained an ethnic, on account of its not being allowable to cure her as an ethnic.' I have given rrjv apxvv the sense of ' at all'; the Latin translation makes ' at first,' retaining the o, and rendering ' qui id initio non fuerat,' and it was, no doubt, to give effect to this that Wieseler proposed his fii) avvaag, which is not a likely manner of expression. The small change I have suggested seems sufficient. But the double Wviktiv seems an accidental repetition, and the first of the two, with the comma, might be omitted.</page><page sequence="23">TIIE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 261 Homily ii. 20. The Syrophenician woman having been cast off by her husband, and given her daughter in marriage, we then read : 17 St icai tfjc OvyarpoQ ocxfiaaei yapov crTeptiOutra Svo ttalSaQ (vvtiaa/jevri, k. t. A. The translators make this cum propter filiam nuptiis se abstineret, &amp;c. I should have thought there was but one way of translating this, ' when, by reason of marriage, she was deprived of her daughter.' Homily ii. 35. Zacchseus comes in early, and announces that Simon postpones the discussion to the next day—17 yap ar/pepov to Si' tvSeKa ripepiiv avrov Tvy\avei aaj3[3aTOv. The Recognitions, in the version of Rufinus have : Differt Simon certaminis diem in undecimum mensis prsesentis, quae est post septem dies, i. 20. This seems to denote a later hand, whether of Rufinus or the compiler of the Recognitions, to evade a difficulty. Cotelerius remarks of the Sabbath, as ex pressed by the Homily, de isto Sabbato Simoniano legisse me memoria non teneo. But I think we can account for this Sabbatical observance. In Horn. ii. 23 we are told that the Simonian body, the formation of which is in this book ascribed to John, who is called an ripipo(ianTi(TTfiQ, consisted of thirty. As our Lord had twelve disciples, answering to the number of months in the year, so He had thirty, answering to the days of the month. And as the woman is an imperfect man, and there is an imperfect day in the Moon's return to the Sun, so He had introduced one woman, namely, Helena, into the body of the company. It was to this number of thirty disciples that Origen re ferred, Celsus i. 57, where he says of all the followers of Simon in his day : ovk 'iariv tvptiv tov aniO/ibv olpai rpia</page><page sequence="24">262 ON THE CLEMENTINE IIOMILIES AND Kovra. A weekly Sabbath would not in any way corre spond with this number. Hence, instead of this, he might have divided the month into three decades, as the Athe nians did theirs. Each Sabbath would then be the eleventh day, reckoning the preceding one. This I take to be the meaning of Si' 'ivSeica fi/ntpiov, ' within eleven days.' Peter sends word to Simon, as in the Parisian MS. : £7th rtXtiwg OtXtiQ, fxera rov yivuxTKiiv oti aoi ore (3ovXei, 8to&lt;l&gt;i\u n-joovotp cnravrav erol/uivg Here O. has tmre Xuwq, which is nonsense, and Lagarde reads, as Leclerc after Davies suggests, IniTeXti &lt;!&gt;?. This is an elegant con jecture, made before the reading of O was known. Still the verb iiriTtXei is scarcely suitable to the occasion. Had the discussion commenced on a previous day it would have been very suitable, but it had not yet begun, and a much simpler word was to be expected. I should prefer to read livsp for liru, ' let it be so,' being quite naturally under stood. The meaning would then be: 'If you absolutely wish, when you know that, with God's help, we are ready to meet you whenever you like.' He seems to hint to Simon that he would be glad to evade the discussion, and had therefore postponed it, in the hope that the next day would not suit Peter's arrangements. Peter therefore says nothing of the next day, but tells him he is ready to meet him on any day he likes. Homily ii. 43. Clement was disappointed at the postponement, but Peter tells him it was, by God's providence, all for the best. He had some of his followers who pretended to be followers of Simon, and thus enabled Peter to know the line of discussion Simon was likely to pursue, and now the delay enables him to give information to Clement which would better prepare him to derive advantage from the</page><page sequence="25">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 263 discussion. Simon's method was by a literal interpreta tion of the anthropomorphic expressions used in reference to God, to charge evil actions and a defective nature against the God of the Old Testament. Peter goes at length into this subject. In the chapter at the head of this note he asks a number of questions, all formed simi larly. Amongst them are—el Si koko. kt'iZci, koI rig ayaSa irpa£ei; el Se kuko. xoiu, icai rig ayaOa ; the Ottob. MS. has in the first clause of the latter question el Si ml kcik&lt;*. The Se is wanting in O., and Lagarde, retaining it, omits the icai without remark. It is probable that Dressel misread the MS. Wieseler is greatly shocked at the Kal in each clause, as at the apparent repetition of the two parallel questions, and he supposes there is a conflation of two recensions; but he was very stupid not to notice the difference between the verbs ktIZei and voieT. The one denotes the original creation—God did not create things originally evil. The other refers to the actions and passions ascribed to God in the Biblical history, such as anger, jealousy, and the like. Peter thinks these expressions were interpolations, but he must not let that appear, if he can help, in the discussion with Simon. For the author of the Homilies does not represent Peter as influenced by a very high sense of controversial honesty. Homily iii. 6. Peter says that if one who denied God, or committed impiety, should afterwards turn and repent, he should be saved, but be also punished for the impiety. He then adds, as Lagarde has emended from the Syriac : 'laug Se, el (jj P.) rijg evrrefSelag virepfioXr) ka) Trig 'iKtoiag (ij P.), kuI tov KoXaaOrivai aTroXvOyueTat, (rvyyvwfj.i)Q r&gt;jc afiapr'iag fitra Ttjg neravoiag SeSwKwg rrjv ayvoiav. This cannot be translated in its present form. Various suggestions have been made, VOL. VII. T</page><page sequence="26">264 ON THE CLEMENTINE HOMILIES AND the least violent of which is Duncker's, to substitute rf/v aiTiav for r&gt;jc a/uapTiaQ. But this leaves out the occasion of the punishment, notwithstanding final salvation. Asimpler remedy is to read avyyvuifiriv, instead of rrvyyvw/n^g. This word, by a natural metonymy, is used as an excuse, and appears to have been a legal term, equivalent to the Latin defirecatio, as a plea to get off from punishment: see Steph. Gr. Thes. s. v. It is this usage of the word that occasions ignorantia to be given as a meaning of avyyvifir] in Labbe's Glossary. We should then render: ' But per haps, if there be an excess of piety and supplication, he shall even be freed from being punished, having offered ignorance, together with repentance, as an excuse for the sin.' Peter proceeds to say : ' But those who have not re pented shall likewise have their end, through the punish ment of fire, even though in all other respects they are most holy.

For to irt/uTTTOV, which Wieseler says is not to be endured, to kAucftov and napiT tov have been suggested. But critics have no right to reject a reading that is grammatically correct, merely because they do not like what is said. The fifth part of a measured seon is no doubt arbitrary, but so is the whole doctrine. A measured aeon would probably be some period of years numbered by some power of ten, and as ten is only subdivided by two and five, the fifth part would be reasonably selected. Homily hi. 7. In this chapter Peter begins, 17 Si tig avrov ciatj3Ha hriv to tv T(jj Ttjc dcoaefiefac Ao-yq ovra teAivtHv Xiyovra, k. t. A. The translators make this—' in ea circa religionem opinione</page><page sequence="27">THE EPISTLES PREFIXED TO TIIEM. 265 mori qua dicitur alium esse Deum.' Nothing could be more absurd; there is no impiety in dying, more than in living, in a false belief. First of all, the commencing article is emphatic, the impiety, q. d. the real impiety. He had just spoken of the impiety that existed first, but was followed by repentance. He now says the real impiety is that one, being in the doctrine of piety, should end in saying that there is another God. As in the former case, the impiety was first, and the change afterwards; here piety existed first, but the man ends in impiety. There is no reference to death, but to a lapse into impiety after previous piety. Of course a man might die in it, or repent again, but it is the lapse from truth that is intended. This manner of speaking is common with Dio Chrysostom. Thus TtXtvTuvTEQ eXeoujuev, ' in the end we pity.' See vol. ii. p. 144, ed. Reiske. Homily iii. 8. The article tt/v is needful in the third line before 7iy&gt;oc avrov avOpwTTw. ' Endeavouring to sow in the souls of those Gentiles that are likely to believe the immortal making love of one only God, tt)v 7rpoc aurov avOpwttwv, I mean that of men towards Him, as distinguished from His love to them.'

This is La garde's text, who has by his own conjecture substituted KaOapiaOivTi for KTifjfltvTt' Now, the two periods of 500 years would, in a lax manner of speaking, pretty well agree with the building of Solomon's temple and its de struction. But then the finding of the Book of the Law in the temple in Josiah's time seems pretty plainly intended. If, then, we adopt the reading KadapiaOivn with Lagarde we must suppose a very large addition to the first 500 years, to be expressed by the rj Ka\ npog. Assuming this, the second 500 years is quite impossible. If we read for the second TrevrriKotria, TrevTriKovra. this with the ttov would be pretty correct. The preceding TrevrtjKoma would account for the scribe substituting the same word for ttivti'ikovto. The word hepa, instead of aXAa, may, however, be thought to indicate a second period of 500 years.
