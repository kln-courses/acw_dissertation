EASTERLY, III E VERY culture must possess an order1 which is either deliberately created (human design) or the result of human experience (human action).2 The articulation of this concept within a society results in civil order, the structure of which is then reflected in laws and legal systems that leave the impress of sovereign authority on the earth's surface.3 The distribution of laws and legal systems and the processes by which they interrelate with the land are proper subjects of concern for the specialized area of political geography, which is here called "geojurisprudence." This paper is devoted to the various aspects of geojurisprudence that are reflected in a study of global patterns of legal systems. A geopolitical scheme of classification is set forth in order to provide a "legal map of the world" that shows the global distribution of the major legal systems and that emphasizes the diffusion of Occiden- tal law (Fig. I).4 From this background, the principle of cultural preadaptation is used to account for legal prevenience in certain emerging geopolitical alignments. GEOPOLITICAL CLASSIFICATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS For the purposes of scholarly exchange and general surveys, a systematic classifi- cation of the various legal systems of the world is needed.5 This need has prompted a number of attempts at ordering legal systems into various groups and families.6 It should be emphasized, however, that any such attempt is inherently imperfect and should "be considered merely as a provisional means of facilitating description and comparison of existing legal systems."' Therefore each ordering of legal systems can be viewed as correct if it accomplishes its purpose. Where that purpose is to prepare a * I wish to thank Dr. M. B. Newton, Jr., for his valuable assistance in the preparation of this paper, especially with reference to the concept of cultural preadaptation. Order describes a state of affairs in which a multiplicity of elements of various kinds are so related to each other that we may learn from our acquaintance with some spatial or temporal part of the whole to form correct expectations concerning the rest, or at least expectations that have a good chance of proving correct (F. A. von Hayek: Law, Legislation and Liberty [Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1973], p. 36). 2 "Human design" is founded on the belief in the superiority of deliberate design and planning over the spontaneous forces of society. "Human action" emphasizes the undesigned results of individual action and spontaneous order. 3 Derwent S.

It is the dominant legal style in only four countries: Afghanistan, the Maldives, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. ' In this paper, "system" is used to indicate the dominant legal style. Concern is with the law that governs the relationships between individuals and between individuals and the state (exclusive of "adminis- trative" law). Because constitutional law develops independently, it is not considered in determining the style of legal systems. 6 Recent examples include classification schemes presented by Konrad Zweigert: Zur Lehre von den Rechtskreisn, in XXth Century Comparative and Conflicts Law, Legal Essays, in Honor of Hessel E.

"legal map of the world," more than one of the possible schemes may be of equal value.8 However, to map the geopolitical distribution of legal systems, various geographical affinities and influences, as well as the strictly legal criteria, must be taken into consideration. Three crucial ideas must be kept in mind. To compare and group legal systems, classification is organized in terms of the prevailing national systems, each contain- ing, in various degrees, elements of international and supranational law: "Almost every legal system consists of several layers, each layer being attributable to a different period of its history." These layers may be the products of an evolution that results in successive strata of legal accretion or the outcome of violent upheaval, such 8 See John H. Wigmore: A Map of the World's Law, Geogr.

Expediency 212</page><page sequence="5">PATTERNS OF LEGAL SYSTEMS as revolution, conquest, or massive immigration; and virtually all legal systems are partly "hybrid" in that their formulators have borrowed from other legal systems.9 For example, the legal systems of developing countries in Asia and Africa are so eclectic that they are difficult to classify on the basis of style or historical development. Nevertheless, a geopolitical classification of legal systems is suitable for the pur- poses of geojurisprudence (Table I). This scheme takes into consideration both legal and geographical criteria, with emphasis on those criteria that underscore the human action/human design dichotomy: habit of legal thinking; the relative position of the judge and the legislator; and the character of the judicial process. THE OCCIDENTAL (EURO-AMERICAN, WESTERN) GROUP When viewing the Occidental (Western) group of legal systems it should be kept in mind that differences among them are fewer than similarities. Each of these systems is a product of Western civilization. However, the differences in philosophical back- ground that distinguish the two principal families of legal systems (Anglo-American Common Law and Romano-Germanic Civil Law) are significant for understanding legal prevenience.?1 THE ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMON LAW FAMILY The Anglo-American Common Law family of legal systemsn owes its existence to the law of England and to laws patterned after those of England.12 Because the creation of English courts was part of the immemorial prerogative of the crown, it developed as an essentially public law. It has been formed, primarily, by judges in resolving individual conflicts. The legal rule is thus intended to provide a just settlement of an issue rather than to formulate a prospective rule of conduct. For guidance in deciding particular cases, judges looked to the ancient usages and customs that formed the common law or the principles of equity, both of which, in Rudolf Schlesinger: Comparative Law (The Foundation Press, Mineola, N.VY, 1970), p. 253. 10 Throughout this paper, I have capitalized the first letter of the terms desigrnating legal systems or "styles" (for example, Common Law), and I have lowercased the first letter of terms for substantive law or legal doctrines (for example, common law when used as a body of case law derived from ancient usages and customs). " The Common Law family includes: in Europe: the British Isles (Great Britain, except Scotland; Northern Ireland; Republic of Ireland; the Isle of Man), Cyprus, and Gibralter; in Asia: Brunei, Hong Kong, India (with Nepal), Pakistan, Malaysia (the Federation, Malaya, Singapore, Borneo Territories, Sabah, and Sarawak), Sikkim, Aden, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and Burma; in America: Bahamas, Bermuda, British Honduras (Belize), Canada (except Quebec), Antigua, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Falkland Islands, Montserrat, St. Christopher-Nevis- Anguilla, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Virgin Islands, and the United States of America (except Louisiana and Puerto Rico); in Africa: Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania, the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, Sudan, and Uganda; Oceania: Australia, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Heard Island, Nauru, Norfolk Island, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, The Ross Dependency, Tokelau Islands (Union Islands), Central and Southern Line Islands, Fiji, Western Samoa, McDonald Islands, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, British Solomon Protectorate, Pitcairn Island (with Henderson, Ducie, and Oe Islands), Tonga, and the Republic of Minerva (Lawrence A. Horne: To Be or Not to Be: The Republic of Minerva-Nation Founding by Individuals, Columbia Journ. Transnatl. Law, Vol. 12, 973, PP- 520-556). 12 For an excellent discussion of the "basic law" of the Common Law legal systems patterned after that of England, see Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray: Commonwealth and Colonial Law (Frederick A. Praeger, New York, 1966). 2I3</page><page sequence="6">THE GEOGRAPHICAI, REVIEW time, were reduced to a body of case law.13 From this case law, judges derived binding judicial precedents that were applied according to the doctrine of stare decisis. The doctrine was temporized by use of legal fictions, special writs, and new judicial remedies. "The chief concern of a common law judge must be the expectation which the parties in a transaction would have reasonably formed on the basis of the general practices that the ongoing order of action rests on."14 Emphasis is placed principally on maintaining a just civil order rather than on the designing of a moral basis for human society. This is evidenced by the extensive concern with procedural law in the form of special writs: certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto.'5 The Common Law, therefore, perceives civil order as established on a theory that makes the undesigned results of individual action the central concern, hence "the result of human action, but not of human design."'6 The law consists of purpose-independent rules that affect the conduct of individ- uals and are applicable to any number of further actions.17 By defining the protected domain of each, an order of actions is formed whereby individuals can make feasible plans. The Common Law emerges from looking to precedents of human experience incorporated into the judicial process which provide rules of universal significance that are applicable to new cases. Statutes, under this concept, tend to vary old rules. The order that is thus maintained is not a designed state of things but the regularity of a process that rests on some of the expectations of the acting persons, who are protected from interference by others.18 For this reason it is a spontaneous order of action established on laws that articulate already observed practices or established rules. This spontaneous order of actions ("human action") exists independently of any particular human will or design. The British colonial policy of "indirect rule" encouraged the continuation of local customary law. The rules of English law were applied only to the extent permitted by local circumstances.19 Principles of English law, consisting of the common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application as they existed at a specified date, were applied with the exceptions and modifications required by local conditions. This English law applied to the fullest extent possible in the colonies, and former British territories tended to preserve their adopted Common Law system. THE ROMANO-GERMANIC (CONTINENTAL) CIVIL LAW FAMILY The Romano-Germanic family of legal systems20 derived its origins from Roman 13 Bryce Lyon: A Constitutional and Legal History of Medieval England (Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1960). 14 Von Hayek, Law, Legislation and Liberty [see footnote i above], p. 86. In this same reference, the great eighteenth-century judge, Lord Mansfield, is quoted as stressing that Common Law "does not consist of particular cases, but of general principles, which are illustrated and explained by those cases." 16 For a discussion of the role of procedural safeguards in Common Law systems, see F. A. von Hayek: The Constitution of Liberty (Henry Regnery Company, Chicago, 1960), pp. 218-219. 16 F.

The belief in the superiority of deliberate design and planning (which largely stems from Cartesian constructivist rationalism, a propensity to ascribe institutions of culture to invention or design by man's reason over the spontaneous forces of civility) has greatly influenced the legal philosophy of these Civil Law systems.21 The result is a positivistic conception of law derived from "a factually untrue anthropomorphic interpretation of grown institutions as the product of design."22 The Romano-Germanic family may identify with the ex- pression, "What man has made he can also alter to suit his desires." This attitude leads to a view of the rule of law as a rule of conduct, intertwined with ideas of justice and morality, which is primarily determined by the activity of legal scholars (who formulate "doctrine") and legislators.23 Practical application of the law, as well as actual administration, is principally the province of the courts, which formulate what Civilians refer to as "jurisprudence." The end result is a perception of civil order that is the result of human design, but not necessarily of human action. This order is established upon laws that are free inventions of the designing mind of the legislator. "Law is a solemn expression of legislative will."24 The idea of supremacy of legislation as a source of law was a basic precept of the Jacobins during the French Revolution of 1789. They contended that egalitarian notions could be best promoted by the exercise of legislative power at the expense of other sources of law, which were thought to be founded on the idea of the inherent inequality of social classes.26 Unlike the principles of British colonial administration, which recognize native customary and religious law, the French system of "direct rule" strongly asserted the central authority of the Parisian imperium. This was an important aspect of the French colonial policy of assimilation, which had little tolerance for native, customary domestic law. Upon gaining independence, many of the former French territories adopted the Napoleonic Code and readily embraced the French Civil Law system as completely as the particular local circumstances allowed.26 Portuguese and Spanish colonial territories were treated as integral portions of metropolitan Portugal and Spain. The laws of these countries were introduced, in totality, to their respective dependencies, excluding explicit recognition of the cus- gola(?), Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, The Channel Islands, Chile, Republic of China, Congo Republic (Brazzaville), Colombia, Costa Rica, Daho- mey, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equitorial Guinea, France (and all French territories), Gabon, West Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia (a plural legal system), Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Jordan, Niger, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal (and Portuguese territories), South Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Ma- lagasy, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Somalia (with some Common Law vestiges in the former British Somaliland), Spain, Spanish Sahara, Surinam, Switzerland, Syria, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Vene- zuela, and Zaire. 21 Von Hayek, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics [see footnote i6 above], pp. 102-105; and idem, Law, Legislation and Liberty [see footnote I above], pp. 8-34. 22 Von Hayek, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics [see footnote 16 above], p. 102. 23 "Doctrine" is formulated for the purpose of working for the progress of legal science and the advancement of law.

REVIEW toms and usages of the people whom they ruled. The same was true of the Belgian Congo, where a distinct civil code was in force. Like the former French colonies, the Portuguese, Spanish, and Belgian territories retained the law and legal systems of their mother countries. Other Asian and African legal systems have voluntarily imported much of the systematics and substantive law of the various Romano- Germanic legal systems.27 Within the Romano-Germanic family it is possible to further divide these Civil Law systems by noting the relative importance of Roman or Germanic elements, thereby creating a Latin subfamily (with France the principal legal system, and Belgium, Holland, Italy, and Spain), and a German subfamily (including West Germany, Switzerland, Austria). The legal systems of Latin America should generally be regarded as part of the Latin subfamily of the Romano-Germanic legal family. However, the Anglo-Ameri- can Common Law (especially that of the United States) has so profoundly affected the development of the public law of the Latin American systems that they may be suggested as a possible separate category in this geopolitical classification. MIXED JURISDICTIONS In this paper, "mixed jurisdictions" refers only to those systems that contain elements of both Common Law and Civil Law. They are usually formed when a Civil Law system is absorbed by a Common Law system. The result is an incorporation of much private, substantive Civil Law into the judicial Common Law. Mixed juris- dictions can be divided on the basis of the nature of their Civilian heritage. With this breakdown, two primary subcategories emerge: those with Roman-Dutch Civil Law influences, which tend to be uncodified (such as the Republic of South Africa, Rhodesia, Lesotho, Botswana, Ceylon); and those with Latin Civil Law influences, which tend to be codified (such as the Philippines, the Seychelles). Mixed Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions include: Basutoland, Bechuana- land, Botswana, British Guiana (Guyana, largely Common Law), Cameroon, Sri Lanka, Lesotho, Louisiana and Puerto Rico, Mauritius, Republic of South Africa, Rhodesia, St. Lucia, Scotland, the Seychelles, Southwest Africa (Namibia), the Philippines, Quebec, Swaziland, New Hebrides, Ethiopia. THE NORDIC (SCANDINAVIAN) FAMILY The Nordic family of legal systems (Scandinavian Law) is similar to the German subfamily of the Romano-Germanic family (especially when contrasted with the Common Law).28 This is particularly true with reference to judicial obedience to commands of abstract authority and legislation, rather than to equitable justice and individual rights. However, the differences between the Nordic family and the sys- tems in the Romano-Germanic family justify a separate category for Scandinavian law. The Nordic legal family includes Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Nor- way, and Sweden. 27 David and Brierley, op. cit. [see footnote 6 above], p. 60. See also Schlesinger, op. cit.

Within the Marxist framework, law is to assist in the creation of modes of thought and action by providing an appropriate environment and by making enforcement an occasion for instruction. This conditioning role of Soviet Law underscores the concern for the creation of a "Soviet morality." The focus, then, of Soviet Law is not on resolving conflict between individuals or competing interests but on bringing people closer to a classless, collectivist society. Judicial proceedings are opportunities to administer authoritative instruction in the interpretation and appli- cation of Soviet Law and its "utopian" purpose. The only source for Soviet Law is the Supreme Soviet, which is both legislative and judicial. Soviet Law, therefore, per- ceives order as "Soviet truth" by human design. The legal systems of the people's democracies can be divided on the basis of residual private law ("Western" legal tradition, Balkan legal tradition, or where another civilization has flourished, such as in the Far East). China became a people's republic on October I, 1949, and has since adhered to a Marxist-Leninist ideology. Until 1957, China appeared to be patterning its legal system after the Soviet model. At that time, China terminated the work of its codification commission and rejected the Soviet ideas of socialist legality and human- istic socialism as contrary to the Chinese interpretation of true Marxist doctrine. Judges were, accordingly, subordinated to the local soviets, not to the law. Decisions are thereby based on expediency instead of principle. This is compatible with the traditional Chinese concepts of conciliation and lack of rigidity in law.31 CULTURAL PREADAPTATION AND LEGAL SYSTEMS Preadaptation is a universal aspect of evolution. The best statement of this concept is provided by W. J. Bock and Gerd von Wahlert. A feature is said to be preadapted when its present forms and functions (both utilized and non-utilized ones) allow one of the faculties (either currently utilized or non-utilized) to acquire a new . . . role and hence establish a new synergical [couple formed by the biological role and the selection force] relationship with the umvelt [species-specific habitat] whenever the need (= appearance of the selection force) for this new adaptation (the faculty) should arise.32 29 The Socialist group includes Albania, Angola(?), Armenia,* Azerbaidzhan,* Bangladesh, Bulgaria,* Byelorussia,* Cambodia, People's Republic of China, Cuba,* Czechoslovakia,* Estonia,* Georgia,* East Germany,* Guinea,* Kirghiz,* North Korea(*?), Laos, Latvia,* Lithuania,* Mali,* Moldavia,* Outer Mongolia,* Poland,* Rumania,* Senegal,* Soviet Union,* Tadzhik,* Turkmen,* Ukraine,* Hungary,* Kazakh,* South Yemen, Uzbek,* and Vietnam(*?). Those jurisdictions marked with an asterisk probably have a Soviet legal model. 30 For discussions of the false concept of reality which is historical dialectical materialism, see F. A. von Hayek: The Counter Revolution of Science (Free Press of Glencoe, London, 1955); and Karl R. Popper: The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge &amp; Kegal Paul, London, 1957). 31 For a discussion of the "Chinese ecumene" that gave rise to a Chinese legal tradition, see Eric Voegelin: Order and History (5 vols.; Louisiana State Univ.

Because geographers may prefer the term "prevenience," which denotes coming before or antecedence, to the term "preadaptation," I use the two inter- changeably. Numerous examples of cultural preadaptation are provided elsewhere.33 Our concern, however, is restricted to what may be called "legal prevenience." This means that a legal system (or individual laws) is present in the relevant place before its special functions become useful in a new manner. The legal system's (or law's) faculty, with minimal change, serves new functions, or the faculty arises in one context but functions in another; in either situation, the crucial attribute emerged for "reasons" other than those it is subsequently observed to serve. The processes that account for legal prevenience are to be found in the underlying human design or human action philosophy of legal systems. In that way, selective forces make possible subsequent functioning in the new context. Cultural preadaptation explains the success of certain legal systems in becoming established in a new country or in predisposing those countries to certain geopolitical alignments. With a single exception, the countries of eastern and southeastern Europe largely belonged in the Civil Law orbit until the I940's.34 The legal philosophy of human design and legislative will predisposed these countries to follow the Soviet model when they came under Communist rule. This legal prevenience is partly evidenced by the similar conception of legal codes, in both Civil Law and Soviet Law, as models of social organization. Both aim at the perfection of society through legislative design.35 Because law in the Soviet system is an instrument for achieving a Marxist society and because the people's democracies of eastern Europe subsequently aligned with the Soviet Union in terms of global politics, there was a prevenience in the Civil Law systems to follow the Soviet model. Accordingly, they aligned with the Soviet Union in the international arena. This concept also holds true with the acceptance of a Marxist ideology by other systems in Asia, Africa (in Mali and Senegal), and Latin America (in Cuba).36 Communist China, Albania, and other exceptions to the preceding remarks only prove the rule on closer inspection. Communist China, though briefly involved with Romano-Germanic Civil Law, was only superficially and ineffectually influenced by Civilian legal science.37 The same is also true of Albania, where Islamic and Ottoman influences, rather than the Civil Law, dominated the pre-Communist legal system. Statistical consideration of the value of cultural preadaptation in explaining the success of these geopolitical alliances has only tended to confirm the conjecture that Civil Law prepares the way for Soviet Law. Some thirty-four Socialist Law juris- dictions have been tallied and their geopolitical alignment assessed. Only two of them remain uncertain as to whether they follow the pattern of legal prevenience and subsequent, probable geopolitical alliance. 33 Milton Newton: Cultural Preadaptation and the Upland South, Geoscience and Man, Vol. 5, 1974, pp. 143-154.

It is, accordingly, no surprise that Guyana (which is largely Common Law) is rapidly becoming Communist China's answer to the Soviet Union's outpost in Cuba.38 Witness, also, India's recent shift toward a realignment with Communist China.39 Furthermore, note the strength of Communist China's diplomatic relations with Pakistan, Bangla- desh, and South Yemen (all of which have a Common Law background).40 The seapower aspect of Communist China's "counter-encirclement strategy" portends the possibility of an informal coalition with the Common Law rim of the Indian Ocean. Both Sri Lanka (Mixed Jurisdiction) and Tanzania (Common Law) are recipients of Chinese naval assistance and are presumed likely to extend port privileges. China has granted warm diplomatic recognition to the Maldives (Islamic Law) and Mauritius (Mixed Jurisdiction). The latter could provide China with important port facilities for the projection, through naval influence, of Chinese influence in East Africa. It is not insignificant to reflect on former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger's recent reference to China as a "quasi-ally" to the United States.41 Given China's view of geopolitical realities, and of herself as the anointed leader of anti-Soviet forces in the world, the United States should also reassess its future security interests in Asia and identify new options for policy toward China."42 The idea that similar legal systems reinforce alignment or, conversely, that diver- sity of legal systems resists alignment, is not novel. Napoleon apparently understood this concept when he proclaimed: "All the United Countries must be like France; and if you unite them to the Pillars of Hercules and to Kamchatka, the laws of France must extend everywhere."43 The eminent comparative law scholar who drafted the Civil Code of Ethiopia, Rene David, noted that the African country desired a Civilian code-based body of substantive law to counteract excessive Anglo-American in- fluence.44 Most importantly, for our purposes, John N. Hazard, noted authority on Soviet Law, observed that "law has become a key weapon in the Soviet arsenal with which the Communists of the U.S.S.R. hope to influence the future of the world."45 Accordingly, if the totalitarian socialists in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America accept the Soviet legal model, then they can be presumed to have emphasized their alignment with the Soviet Union. Alternatively, if the totalitarian socialists reject the Soviet legal model in favor of the Chinese variation, a new geopolitical alignment emerges and Soviet leadership will correspondingly weaken. It was interesting to observe what happened in Angola and Southeast Asia.

North and South Vietnam were effectively French Civil Law in their orientation. These countries are expected to join the Soviet orbit. On the other hand, the legal system of Cambodia- although subjected to French Civilian influences-never had been effectively subdued by the Romano-Germanic legal family. Cambodia, as expected, has followed the Chinese example.46 All states with a Civil Law background (Fig. I) can be said to be preadapted to alignment with the Soviet Union. The only probable exceptions are in those states where Islamic Law is still a dominant force or where non-Soviet powers exert plausible countervailing force. By contrast, all states following the Common Law are predisposed to align with Communist China, subject to countervailing Soviet force. It must be remembered, however, that the Civilian influence must be effective and substantial and that the subsequent geopolitical alignment must be real and not ephemeral. 46 See "Russia's Drive for a Global Empire," U.S. News &amp; World Report, Mar. 29, 1976, pp. 18-19.
