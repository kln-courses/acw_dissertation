<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Failed Theodicy of a Rabbinic Pariah: A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah* James A. Diamond The ostracized second century rabbinic rebel, Elisha ben Abuyah (Aher), is featured in Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed as the archetype of intellectual degeneracy. His reckless drive to gain knowledge of what in itself is the ultimate goal of man qua man ended, not only in dismal failure, but in an overwhelming and inescapable mire of self-deception. Elisha's impetuous foray into esoteric fields of knowledge stands in marked contrast to the methodical and conscientiously programmatic approach of his colleague who accompanied him on his esoteric journey, Rabbi Aqiba. Their discrepant entries into the pardes, identified by Mai- monides as the fields of physics and metaphysics1, are reflected in the Talmudic account of their respective aftermaths with R. Aqiba having "entered in peace and gone out in peace" and Elisha resorting to "cutting the shoots."2 The original Talmudic characterizations are particularly apt for the Maimonidean paradigm where caution and patience are realized in "peace" while aggressive zeal succumbs to the violence of "uprooting". * Many thanks to Kenneth Seeskin for his customary valuable comments on an earlier draft of this article. This study evolved out of a paper I presented at the Thir- teenth World Jewish Congress, 2001, in Jerusalem. 1 See the Mishneh Torah (MT), Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, 4: 13 which directly refers to the pardes of Elisha/ Aqiba fame. For the meaning of the term pardes within its Talmudic context see G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism Merkabah Mysticism and Talmu- dic Tradition, New York 1965, pp. 16-17. For a medieval debate as to whether this entry into the Pardes involves an actual ascension or is a metaphor for some form of con- templative ascent see R. Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes (Rashi), who advocates the former and Tosafot who is a proponent of the latter. For the widespread understanding of the pardes as referring to esoteric doctrine regarding the nature of God see H. Davidson, "The Study of Philosophy as a Religious Obligation", in S. D. Goitiein, ed., Religion in a Religious Age, Cambridge Mass., 1974, p. 63. 2 BT, Hagigah 14b. Maimonides quotes the characterization of Aqiba's success but not that of Elisha's failure in 1: 32 of the Guide. Perhaps he does not wish to diminish the potency of the sobriquet Aher as the antithesis of Aqiba's shalom, which will be- come apparent at the conclusion of this paper to be two opposing states of being.

Diamond JSQ 9 Aher has slipped into a kind of madness, replete with delusions and hallucinatory figments akin to the apparitions which plague them who "persist in looking at brilliant or minute objects."3 Though we are in- formed as to Aher 's flawed cognitive assumptions, Maimonides leaves us guessing as to the speculative domain which he invaded, as well as the nature of the conclusions to which he "jumped". It is simply implausible that so egregious a conceptual felony as committed by Aher would be entirely occluded from the Guide. Its probative value would be immea- surable, both for determining the general pitfalls that are to be avoided in logical reasoning, as well as pinpointing the specific issue that is par- ticularly prone to those pitfalls and therefore more demanding of ex- treme caution when contemplated. Consistent with what Leo Strauss has discovered to be a predominant septenarius feature of the Guide* but not with his schematic structure, chapter 1: 32, the core Elisha chapter, forms part of a discrete unit of seven chapters beginning with 1: 30 and ending with 1: 36. Though we have encountered a smattering of chapters so far which do not, strictly speaking, deal with a particular equivocal term5, this unit constitutes the first lengthy and sustained interruption of the lexicographical section. It is launched by a chapter dedicated to the term akhol (eating) which is a metaphor for knowledge, and figures predominantly in the discursive unit that follows, particularly with respect to Elisha. The equivocal terms which initiate this interregnum on knowledge and its limits are "eating" {akhol) and "water" (mayim), terms which feature prominently in the Maimonidean presentation of the Aqiba/ Elisha polarity. Eating, as a physical activity, connotes sustenance and consumption thereby lending itself as a metaphor for both endurance and destruction at one and the same time. The latter sense connotes a "putting off of a form" while the former aptly conveys the acquisition of knowledge " through which the permanence of the human form en- dures."6 Two of the four verses cited by Maimonides illustrating the sense of eating as knowledge incorporate "honey" as an image both in a negative and positive sense. Prov. 25:27, which surfaces in the Elisha chapter, warns against too much of a good thing, " It is not good to eat too much honey," while Proverbs 24: 13 qualifies honey as "good" and recommends its ingestion, "My son eat thou honey for it is good." The verse immediately following is also quoted, " so know thou wisdom to 3 Ibid. 4 See his Introduction to the GP (Guide of the Perplexed, ed. Sh. Pines, Chicago 1963). 5 Eg. 1:17,26. 6 GP, 1:30, p. 63.</page><page sequence="3">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 355 be unto the soul," to perfect the equation between "eating" and "know" and "honey" and " wisdom". As this dietary supplement is absorbed by the soul (nefesh) and as "soul" is "a term denoting the rational soul, I mean the form of man,"7 the combination of the two verses attest to the assertion that "eating" contributes metaphorically to "the permanence of the human form." The chapter then proceeds to deal with "water" whose metaphorical sense of "knowledge", we are told, has become so overpowering as to virtually usurp its primary meaning.8 Parameters of metaphor have been established for the imagery of "eating", "honey" and "water", logically prefacing the Elisha chapter in which they have central roles to play. However, it will be demonstrated that the assembly of prooftexts also sets the conceptual stage for what is to follow. These introductory prooftexts for the equation between eating and wisdom provide the first, and possibly the pivotal, clue to a full appre- ciation of Elisha's fall. All the verses cited by Maimonides, line up in a progressive argument as to what constitutes appropriate consumption. It is the leitwort, tov (good), which aligns all the verses into a discursive unit. Isa. 55: 1 "Come ye, buy and eat," establishes the primary mandate to perform the activity of eating. Isa. 55:2 "...eat ye that which is good," provides the criteria for what is edibly acceptable- "good" (tov). Prov. 25:27 and 24: 13-14 identify the precise substance which qualifies as "good"-honey (24:13: "Eat thou honey for it is good..." (ki tov)) - and qualify the manner of consuming the "good" which can result in "no good"-excess (25:27 " it is not good to eat much honey.") Elisha is accused in 1: 32 of violating the proscription of this last verse. The pre- dominant concept which informs the entire excursus on evil in part III of the Guide is that God can solely be associated with the good since "He only produces being and all being is good." 9 Tov is what captures this notion, as evidenced by the almost daily evaluation of each stage of creation as tov and by the final divine assessment of Gen. 1:31, "And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good." (tov meod.) This comprehensive perspective on creation as "good" is the verse which launches the Guide's investigation into the root of the com- mon error to which man is prone on this issue.10 To gorge on what is "good" is to arrive at its opposite, the "not good" of Prov. 25:27. Elisha overreacted and assimilated the "not good" which, as will be demon- 7 Ibid., 1:41. 8 Ibid., 1:30, p. 64, "...it has become, as it were, the first meaning...". 9 GP.

Τον, a primary leitwort of the biblical Genesis account, is, for Maimo- nides, a technical term for a particular design feature of all of creation. Maimonides dismisses the quest for telos for any aspect of existence as an exercise in futility. All that can ultimately be ascertained is that every- thing is simply a product of God's volition, a proposition confirmed by the rabbinic tradition as well, that "there does not exist a final end but only will alone."11 All judgments regarding the function and goal of existence are reduced to the proposition that "He brought every part of the world into existence and that it conformed to its purpose."12 The repeated declaration at creation that it was good, simply conveys the notion that the particular facet of existence in question conforms to its purpose for Τον "is an expression applied by us to what conforms to our purpose."13 The all encompassing finale of very good is merely an affirmation that "everything that was produced conformed to its own purpose, and nothing went wrong."14 Perplexity15 and restlessness16 await those who conduct the senseless search for "any final end for what has no final end except for its own existence."17 To determine a telos rather than to descriptively record the interconnection between all of creation's working parts is to elide the import of tov. Τον militates against a teleological nexus between one constituent of creation and another. Any biblical assertions to the contrary are "merely information about their nature."18 For example, the dictum regarding man, And have dominion over the fish of the sea (Gen. 1:28) "does not mean that man was created for the sake of this, but merely gives information about man's nature with which He has stamped him."19 Yehuda Liebes' masterful treatment of the pordes episode traces the "sins" of Elisha to a morally flawed personality. Arrogance and hubris frustrate any attempt to come to grips with the problem of theodicy and foment his downward spiral into decadence.20 Liebes' reading, I believe, 11 Ibid., 111:13, p. 452. 12 Ibid., p. 453. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 15 P. 448. 16 P. 45. 17 Ibid. 18 Ibid., p. 454. iy Ibid. 20 Yehuda Liebes, The Sin of Elisha: The Four Who Entered Pardes and the Nature of Talmudic Mysticism (Heb.), Jerusalem 1990.

Misinterpreting tov as a teleological affirmation rather than as a culmination of a functionally descriptive account of the crea- tion is precisely what leads to an egocentrism regarding man's place in it. To view creation from the vantage of man at its apex is to commit the cardinal intellectual transgression: "Know that the majority of the false imaginings that call forth perplexity in the quest for the end of the existence of the world as a whole or the end of every part of it have as their root an error of man about himself and his imagining that all that exists exists because of himself alone, as well as ig- norance of the nature of inferior matter and ignorance of what is primarily intended - namely, the bringing of everything whose existence is possible, existence being indubitably a good."21 These concluding remarks to Maimonides' account of the affiliated is- sues of providence and evil are symmetrically linked to those initiating the discussion. The root of all intellectual turmoil regarding the problem of God and evil is located in anthropocentrism, for "every ignoramus imagines that all that exists exists with a view to his individual sake: it is as if there were nothing that exists except him. And if something hap- pens to him that is contrary to what he wishes, he makes the trenchant judgment that all that exists is an evil."22 The egoistic caricature of Elisha portrayed in the rabbinic literature qualifies him, for Maimo- nides, as ineluctably bound for intellectual chaos on the issue of evil. His intellectual disposition renders him incapable of constructing a co- herent theodicy, which entails philosophical presuppositions that are inimical to his egoism. Narcissism is concomitant to "ignorance of the nature of inferior matter" which, at the onset of pondering evil, in III 1 1, "Elisha ben Abuya: Torah and the Sinful Sage", Journal of Jewish Thought and Philo- sophy, vol. 7, (1998), pp. 129-225 with an appendix devoted to a sustained critique of Liebes, pp. 211-225, and Alon Goshen-Gottstein, The Sinner and the Amnesiac: The Rabbinic Invention of Elisha ben Abuya and Eleazer ben Arach, Stanford 2000, pp. 21- 229. Rubenstein's criticisms are really irrelevant to my preference for Liebes' reading since I am not dealing in this paper, with a talmudic passage on its own terms, but rather with how a major rabbinic figure, in this case Maimonides, has received the rabbinic traditions and recast them. In fact, the very criticism directed at Liebes' study by Rubenstein may actually work in Maimonides' favour for understanding his appro- priation of Elisha. Being firmly rooted within the rabbinic tradition, as opposed to a modern scholarly/literary/critical tradition, Maimonides would have been more likely to construct his own portrait on the basis of a "composite picture of Elisha that emerges from synthesizing and reconciling disparate texts" (Rubenstein, p. 223). 21 GPt 111:26, p. 506. 22 Ibid., 111:12, p. 442.</page><page sequence="6">358 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 is also a consequence of misconstruing the very good of Gen. 1:31 as being exclusive, rather than inclusive of "even the existence of this in- ferior matter."23 The second cola of Prov. 25:27 poses an obscure parallel to the first of "eating too much honey is not good (tov).99 In terms of its ethical con- notations it is positioned well as it constitutes an antidote to pride and egoism. Based on the general rule of biblical parallelism24, the negative of the first cola of the verse should be read into the second eliciting the reading, "and the search for their glory is not glory (kavod)." Kavod is not attainable by way of the pursuit for self-glorification, and, as we have seen, evil becomes problematic when one is possessed of a trait where all is judged in terms of the self. Moral weakness seeps into the world of thought and dooms the eternal quest for kavod, God's essence, to dismal failure. Prefacing his discussion of tov as an essential ingredi- ent of all creation is a unique interpretation of the verse "The lord hath made everything for his sake," (Prov. 16:4) as "For the sake of His essence that is for the sake of His will."25 This is the equivalent of the proposition that all exists solely because of God's will and not for the sake of anything else.26 Physical observation yields laws of natural caus- ality where A must be prior to Β in order for Β to exist, yet does not allow for the presumptuous conclusion that A exists for the sake of B. Maimonides' illustration of this logical axiom presages the discussion of the tov principle and the problem of evil which follows. A "will" con- structed world envisions a divine thought pattern which posits all exis- tence as a product of essence: "I have created that first thing, as for instance matter, which must indispensably have come prior to everything material. Then I made that thing which came first or after it that which I 23 Ibid., p. 440. This outlook that all exists for the sake of man is labelled a "raving". Jerome Gellman has demonstrated that all instances of this term in Maimonides bear a technical connotation of a metaphysical category mistake of failing to "maintain a rigid metaphysical distinction between form and matter." This violation of Galen's principle which treats matter as perfect as form, is precisely the error of Elisha that is at the heart of my argument. See "Maimonides' Ravings" in Review of Metaphysics 45, 1991, pp. 310-328 at 312-315. 24 James Kugel, The Idea of Biblical Poetry, New Haven 1981. 25 GP, 111:13, p. 453. 26 It is striking how often Maimonides' positions and those of his later archnemesis converge on various issues. On this they are in complete accord with Spinoza, also taking a radical anti-teleological stance for some of the same reasons, "If God acts toward an end, He necessarily desires something He lacks." He even alludes to the same verse, Prov. 16:4, as a criticism of anthropocentric theologies. See Ethics, I, app. (6, II, p. 80, 11. 22-26) ed., C. Gebhardt, Spinoza Opera, 4 vols., Heidelberg 1925.

The latter is a misconstrual of divine will, essence, as the basic building-block and end of all creation lending a positive reality to evil which is irreconcilable with God's kavod.2% If man is the yardstick by which all is measured then all his personal misfortunes - illness and death - yield evils that defy theoretical reconciliation with God as the ground of all being. The antonymous rabbinic pairing of Aqiba and Elisha are anteceded by their biblical counterparts, Moses and the nobles of Israel as config- ured by Maimonides. Moses, at the sight of the burning bush, is the very picture of intellectual humility who hid his face (Exod. 4:6) in a gesture of supreme restraint when confronted with the irresistible prospect of ultimate truth.29 His biblical converse is represented by the nobles of the children of Israel whose intellectual recklessness and impatience led to a corrupt apprehension of God tainted by anthropomorphism. Their revelation was diluted by the crass corporealisms of feet and sapphire (Exod. 24: 10) ensuing from "their overhasty rushing forward before they had reached perfection."30 Aside from the obvious temperamental parallel between this biblical pair and their rabbinic successors, there are two other instructive points of intersection - the imagery of eating and the sharing of a common prooftext. Maimonides favours a midrash which conceives of a causal link be- tween those who participated in this perverse vision (nobles and the sons of Aaron - Nadab and Abihu) and their untimely deaths.31 They are accused of "feasting their eyes" upon God and casting a glance at God while dining, an object far too serious for such casual and lax 27 Ibid., p. 454. 28 Prov. 25:27 is also cited by Maimonides in Hilkhot De'ot 3:2 of the Mishneh Torah as a health warning against eating foods that are deleterious to our particular digestive temperament. Once again an illustration of a self inflicted harm. For the general purpose of the Torah's dietary restrictions see GP 3:35, "...to put an end... to taking the desire for food and drink as an end in itself." 29 Ibid., 1:5, p. 29. 30 Ibid., p. 30. 31 Leviticus Rabbah xx. The motivating factor behind Maimonides' choice of con- trasting Moses with the "nobles" may very well have been this midrash, which also plays Moses off of the "nobles." There certainly was no dearth of midrashic offences attributed to Nadab and Abihu from which he could have chosen. See Avigdor Shi- nan's "The Sins of Nadab and Abihu in Rabbinic Literature," Tarbiz 48, 1978/79, pp. 201-214.</page><page sequence="8">360 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 attention. Maimonides subtly transforms the midrashic precipitation of sin to its consequences. And they visioned God and did eat and drink, (Exod. 24: 11) indicates a cause/effect sequence of "because of the cor- ruption of their apprehension they inclined toward things of the body."32 Arrogance regarding the sublime leads to a preoccupation with the base and an inability to penetrate beyond one's material situation. Once again, in the discussion proper of evil, dining habits reflect a balanced or distorted perception of evil in the world. Excess is the source of the most ubiquitous evil in the world, "those that are afflicted upon any individual among us by his own action."33 Not only is gluttony physi- cally harmful, it also distorts philosophical perspectives on evil. It con- fuses the means for the end and substitutes matter for form as human telos. If reality is measured by matter, and defective matter abounds, then the problem of evil is an overwhelming one.34 However, man does not realize that he is the creator of his own misfortune and that a "con- cupiscence for eating, drinking, and copulation, is the cause of all cor- poreal and psychical diseases and ailments".35 The common prooftext which both Elisha and the nobles share is the Solomonic advice they are said to have ignored, "Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of God (beit elohim)" (Eccles. 4: 17).36 The house of God refers to the Tabernacle or temple which must be approached with extreme caution. The rationale for the complex and strict regime of restrictions on entering the Temple is to inculcate a feeling of venera- tion and awe for the geographical focus of God's presence.37 The barrier set up by the laws of ritual impurity allow for only rare opportunities to visit the Temple precinct so that "an impression leading to the humility that was aimed at will be produced."38 Within the context of the nobles and Elisha, the verse imports this notion of humility into the world of 32 GP, p. 30. 33 Ibid., 111:12, p. 445. 34 See Perush HaMishnayot LeRambam, Heb., trans., J.

For an exam- ple of his teleology ofmitzvot see Yitzhak Twersky, "On Law and Ethics in the Mishneh Torah: A Case Study of Hilkhot Megillah II: 17, Tradition 24:2, 1989, pp. 138-149.</page><page sequence="9">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elis ha ben Abuyah 361 thought, which demands restraint and sufficient preparedness prior to delving into the essential questions of being. The verse which Maimonides attributes to Elisha's transgression ad- dresses the perils of devouring excessive honey. "Hast thou found hon- ey? Eat so much as sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it" (Prov. 25: 16.).39 Considering my proposal, that Elisha blun- dered over the quandary of reconciling God with what seems to be pervasive evil in the world, this verse epitomizes the problem on a num- ber of levels. Firstly it presents a circumstance which appears promi- nently as the root cause of the most widespread of evils - those that are self-inflicted. Emblematic of this phenomenon is, as I have already noted, "concupiscence for eating and drinking and copulation and doing these things with excess in regard to quantity ..."40 Secondly, overeating is indicative of prioritizing food as an end rather than a means and when that end is frustrated, God's omnipotence is called into question. Final- ly, the context of the verse leads us back into the domain of Temple sanctity. It is to be read in conjunction with the verse which follows, parallel in structure, theme and language, "Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbour's house lest he be sated with thee and hate thee" (Prov. 25: 17). Maimonides cites the rabbinic employment of the verse to estab- lish the principle of "familiarity breeds contempt" with respect to the temple.41 Accordingly, restricted entry is guaranteed by the proliferation of sources of uncleanness, rendering the possibility of a clean individual the rare exception rather than the rule. However, this reading of Mai- monides becomes slightly more refined when considered in light of the verse's Talmudic manipulation to which he alludes. The verse is taken to inveigh against frequenting the Temple with "sin and trespass offerings." Abstention from sin is called for, thus dispensing with the need for these types of sacrifices. Structurally the hate ensuing from the frequent visita- tion of verse 25: 17 parallels the vomit induced by the overindulgence of sweets of 25: 16. Rashness of thought on the issue of evil, implicit in the imagery of 25: 16, is mirrored in the crass links that would be formulated between sin and punishment should temple visitation be sin oriented. One might be tempted to make a simplistic equation between sin, suffer- 39 In all the extant versions of the Talmud this verse is quoted in respect of Ben Zoma and not Elisha. It is too speculative to hypothesize an intentional switch here by Maimonides as Sara Stroumsa does. Although possible, the safer position would be not to rule out the existence of a variant text possessed by Maimonides which indeed reads as quoted by him. 40 GPy p. 445. 41 See 111:47, p. 593 and b Hagigah 7a.</page><page sequence="10">362 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 ing and absolution granted by the sacrificial cult. In reality, although suffering is "due to divine will in accordance with the deserts of those people as determined by His judgements," full comprehension of how God's judgment operates "cannot be attained by our intellects."42 The next verse cited, following in the vein of Prov. 25: 27 and 25: 16, is Eccl. 7:16, "Neither make thyself overwise; why shouldst thou destroy thyself." Moderation in contemplative matters is a corollary of the ethi- cal "golden mean" espoused by Maimonides in Hilkhot De'ot of his legal compendium. The first cola of this verse, Don 't be overly righteous, adresses the extreme on the other end of the ethical scale occupied on one end by the excess of too much honey. Whereas the latter discourages over-indulgence, the former restrains inordinate abstinence. Self-denial over and above what is restricted by law violates the rule of the "golden mean" and "included in this those who constantly fast are not along the good path."43 Both an abstemious and a sybaritic character belie the same malaise - an obsession with the material. Though antipodes, both are overly engaged with matter and fail to grasp the tov of matter which "conforms to its purpose." The final biblical prooftext extracted from Psalms and, of course, assumed by Maimonides to be from the pen of King David, is an auto- biographical disavowal by David of ever having committed intellectual trespass into domains beyond his capacity. David is the ideal whose model of behavior of "Neither do I exercise myself in things too great or things too marvellous for me" (Ps. 131:1), Elisha failed to follow. David's intellectual chastity is directly preceded in the same verse with a declaration of ethical innocence and pride. As we have seen, vulner- ability to the precipitous acquisition of esoteric knowledge is a conse- quence of this moral foible and so David denies ever being subject to its allure: "My heart is not haughty nor my eyes raised so high" (Ps. 131:1). Intellectual humility is a natural consequence of never having fallen prey to the delusions of grandeur that is a monarch's occupa- tional hazard.44 Elisha and his ilk are then accused of not paying heed to the counsel of Ben Sira as quoted by the Talmud, "Do not inquire about things that 42 GP, 111:17, p. 472. 43 Hilkhot De'ot 3:1. 44 See Numbers Rabbah which correlates each segment of this verse to some pivotal event in David's life when he was able to stave off grandiose behaviour. Most relevant for my thesis is the correlation of the last phrase with his most unroyal conduct when returning the Ark to Jerusalem. What appears to some as undignified and "common" behaviour is for Maimonides an illustration of the highest level of performing a mitzvah out of pure joy. See MT, Hilkhot Sukkot 8: 16.</page><page sequence="11">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 363 are too marvellous for you; do not investigate what is hidden from you; inquire into things that are permitted to you; you have no business with marvels."45 Punctuating a long discussion about the nature and number of heavens, firmaments and, in particular a heaven known as araboth, as well as God's habitat, this Talmudic admonishment's context provides another clue to Elisha's blunder. Maimonides demonstrates an unusual attraction to the rabbinic figurative representation of the inner workings of this particular heaven which he takes as a referent "solely to one heaven: that which encompasses the universe."46 It is this heaven which God is said to "ride" (rakhob), an equestrian metaphor for "His instru- ment by means of which He governs that which is existent."47 Araboth is closely associated with righteousness (tsedek) both rabbinically and bib- lically. Among other ethereal substances such as souls and the dew that will revive the dead, it is the abode of "righteousness {tsedek), right deal- ing (tsedakah) and justice (mishpat) ...". Maimonides favours this mid- rash, which, by locating these entities within the highest heaven known as araboth, conveys a dimension of governance whereby "the forces gen- erating the particular thing in question and safeguarding its order come from that heaven."48 The araboth has also been biblically established as God's throne because He rides in it (Ps. 68:5) and because "righteous- ness (tsedek) and justice (mishpat) are the foundation of Thy throne." (Ps. 89: 15.). Ben Sira's exhortation is a strategic allusion to the all-en- compassing sphere (araboth) as the destination of Elisha's journey. He has embarked upon a path which should eventually lead him to the source of tsedek and mishpat in the world but instead, upon his arrival he is ensnared in an intellectual quagmire of confusion. The idea that haughtiness and hubris are particularly associated with posing an obstacle to what the araboth stands for is enhanced by an ironic reversal of that character trait. The verse which signifies God's supreme control over the encompassing heaven is Deut. 33:26. The first cola of the verse, The rider of the heavens, establishes that God "moves it in virtue of His power and His will."49 The second cola, and in His excellency (pride) on the skies, parallels the preceding cola in the sense that the araboth emerges "in virtue of His pride" What is symbolized by the araboth is a manifestation of God's pride. There remains no room for the assertion of any other identity which imposes itself as a result of 45 BT, Hagigah 13a. 46 GP, 1:70, p. 172. 47 Ibid., p. 173.

God's pride can only be penetrated by a con- traction of one's own pride as typified by the restraint and humility of Moses covering his eyes at the burning bush. Once the araboth has been identified as the throne of glory, the reader of the Guide is directed to Elisha's biblical precursor, the nobles of the children of Israel, for a more expository account of the error to which he succumbed. The vision to which this class was privy is described graphi- cally in Exod. 24: 10 as "under his feet, as it were, a work of the white- ness of sapphire stone." Onkelos' interpretation of "his feet" as the throne of glory is cited by Maimonides with some approval.50 For Mai- monides the term "foot" (regel) establishes a causal nexus with the sub- stance below symbolized by the whiteness of sapphire stone. The latter, considering the transparency of its colour, stands for "first matter" which "in respect of its true reality lacks all forms and on this account is capable of receiving all forms in successsion."51 The object of the nobles' philosophical investigation then was "first matter and the rela- tion of the latter to God, inasmuch as it is the first among the things He has created that necessitates generation and corruption"52 This last phrase is crucial to the Maimonidean theodicy since the survival and perpetuation of all of existence is contingent on the quality οι generation and corruption naturally inherent in matter. All that man identifies as evil is associated with this essential quality of matter. The nobles appre- hended "the true reality of first matter",53 an assertion which is reiter- ated during an appraisal of the Platonic position on creation where the same vision of Exod. 24: 10 is reconfirmed as "the true reality of the inferior first matter."54 What is most peculiar about Maimonides' account of the nobles' vision is a marked discrepancy between his evaluation of that vision in different sections of the Guide. What has just been canvassed in 1:28 is a grasp of one aspect of creation- first matter- untainted by any deficiency, misconception, or intellectual arrogance. An earlier account, however, offers an incongruous assessment of the very same vision as "corrupt", "imperfect", arrived at "overhastily" and tarnished by "corporeality."55 In fact, the very same metaphor of under His feet as it were, a work of the whiteness of sapphire stone, which represented "the true reality of first 50 1:23, p. 60. 51 Ibid., p. 61. 52 Ibid. 53 Ibid. 54 11:26, p. 331. »1:5, p. 30.</page><page sequence="13">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elis ha ben Abuyah 365 matter" in 1:28, is "solely intended to present a criticism of their act of seeing ...," in 1: 5. If the biblical imagery was never intended as a literal depiction, then how can its literality be exploited to attribute anthropo- morphism to the subjects of the vision? The accusation of corporeality clashes discordantly with the figurative hermeneutic applied in 1:28. There a facet of existence and its relationship to the Creator has been assimilated. What could possibly be objectionable about gaining insight into an aspect of being? Maimonides' criticism of the nobles is directed at their level of achievement coincident with an event which could not be more oppor- tune, the Sinaitic theophany. Though they procured a certain intellec- tion, they arrogantly set their sights much higher than they were prop- erly prepared for. Therefore, what I would propose is abhorrent regard- ing their attainment, is a confusion between what was initially aimed for and what in the end result was actually obtained. Success, according to Maimonides, would have been indicated by the curtailing of their vision from the God of Israel (Elohim) and there was under his feet etc. to simply the God of Israel The latter is what they aspired to, but due to the impulsive assault toward this goal, their efforts culminated in a God of first matter, "inasmuch as it is the first among the things He has created that necessitates generation and corruption..."56 Given that the original quest was for the "God of" (eloheî) which connotes "gov- ernance",57 the repercussions for associating God's governance with that which "necessitates generation and corruption" were catastrophic. The "corporeality" which is said to have undermined the integrity of their vision would have wreaked particular havoc for the Maimonidean the- odicy since it would implicate God in the process of generation and corruption. All evils associated with the latter process (death, illness, deterioration) are privations with which God can have no essential link. To confuse God's governance with the modus operandi of matter is to attribute an ongoing working relationship between Him and what is perceived as evil in the world. They committed a category error which mistook the God who creates prime matter with the "God who governs," allowing for the warped assertion that "He produces evil in an essential act."58 Their haste to reach the araboth, (throne) or "His instrument by means of which He governs that which is existent,"59 doomed them to confound their goal with its subordinate, first matter, for it is "in true 56 1:28, p. 61. 57 See 1:2 and 11:30, p. 359 where He is Elohim = 'He who governs . 58 III: 10, p. 440.

Underscoring this escapade as no minor mishap is Maimonides' char- acterization of the distinction between heavenly matter and terrestrial matter as "one of the mysteries of being and a mystery among the mys- teries of the Torah."61 During the course of the exposition on the mean- ing of the whiteness of the sapphire stone, our attention is explicitly di- rected to a later chapter in the Guide. In II: 26 the rabbinic equivalent to the precious material the nobles envisioned is the snow under the throne of glory from which the earth was created.62 Conversely, the heavens were said to have their origins in the light of His garment, thereby for- mulating a bifurcation of the universe into "two matters, a high and an inferior one."63 Elisha and the nobles confounded the two, attenuating God's involvement into a domain with which He is only accidentally related. Failure to maintain the distinct nature of heaven and earth will most certainly distort the measure of God's proximity to each do- main calibrated by "the sublimity of that matter [heaven] and its near- ness to Him and the defectiveness of the other [earth] and also the place where it is located."64 Elisha's and the nobles' own existential remote- ness from God mirrors the conceptual distance of the earth. As for the consequences of their heinous act, Maimonides refers to a midrashic tradition which accords the nobles and Nadab and Abihu a 60 1:28, p. 61. In Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 3:3 Maimonides emphasizes that the spheres are devoid of all physical properties including colour, and therefore "what we see as blue (tekhelet) is really an optical illusion due to the atmospheric height." The colour tekhelet is how the firmament (rakia) appears to the human eye as qualified in Hilkhot Tsitsit 1:1, where one of the threads of the ritual fringes must bear this dye. That this only relates to a colour which "appears" to the human eye when gazing at the firmament is reiterated in 2: 1 of the same section in the MT. This is rooted in the Talmudic association of the tekhelet with ultimately the "throne of glory" via a series of correspondences based on colour similarity. The route the mind follows when look- ing at the tekhelet of the fringes is: sea - » firmament - » throne of glory! BT, Sotah 12a, Menahot 43b. The prooftext for the last association is "the work of the whiteness of a sapphire stone". Maimonides omits the intermediate step and draws a direct equiva- lence between the dye and what appears to be the colour of the firmament. I would suggest that the purpose of this tekhelet is to remind man that the domains of the firmament, the throne of glory, and the sapphire stone present themselves as optical illusions which are not to be mistaken for their true reality. The esoteric nature of this realm becomes evident in that it is an essential component of the Account of the Char- iot. See 111:4 where the colour of the wheels of EzekiePs chariot, "beryl", is also iden- tified (though via the Aramaic Targum) with "the whiteness of a sapphire stone." 61 11:26, p. 331. 62 Ibid., quoting Pirke deRabbi Eliezer, ch.

In both cases the punishment takes the form of a fire which consumes, literally "eats" (akhol), the perpetrators. Within the Maimonidean hermeneutic the rabbinic standard of "measure for mea- sure" retribution operates with striking precision. The perpetrator's of- fence constituted, as in the case of Elisha, a metaphorical "eating" or gluttony which appropriately invites a punitive response in kind - a divine "eating". Num. 11:1 is cited, among others, as illustrative of the figurative sense of "eating" for "destruction and undoing and, in general, to all putting-off of a form."66 Considering the last phrase, the retributive measure addresses the substantive nature of the offence as well, which was a failure to reconcile defective reality with God's omniscience. Paramount in resolving the evil of destruction and death is a notional reorientation toward these phenomena as a vacating of form, "With regard to every living thing, death is the privation of form."67 Their botched theodicy incurs a personal "putting off of form". Even the cardinal ingredient of Maimonides' theory of evil which denies God any essential link with deficiency is implicit in the retributive verse of Num. 11:1. The punishment is provoked by divine auditory function: And the Lord heard. Every instance of this function in a divine context is expressive simply of "apprehension",68 with this verse being specifically cited as one example of the same. Since God never acquires new knowledge, being a constant intellect in actu,69 God cannot be re- sponding to anything in these circumstances. He simply knows, and knows what He has always known. The verse then recounts a natural "putting-off of form" which may have been causally precipitated by a prior maculation of form. Moses, on the other hand, is granted the ultimate in human form, if apprehension is considered the natural form of man,70 in return for his laudatory self restraint at the burning bush.71 Though Moses' later re- 65 1:5.

Diamond JSQ 9 velation of God's back merits a comprehensive treatment on its own, there is one aspect of it which is of particular relevance to this study and which starkly opposes his persona to that of the Eiishã/ nobles camp. God favours Moses' query of "Show me thy ways" (Exod. 33:13) with the revelatory gesture, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee" (33: 19). This goodness conjures up the very good divine assessment of Gen. 1:31 at the summit of the world's genesis. Moses occupies the same vantage point as God at creation from which he per- ceives all existing things, and "apprehends their nature and the way they are mutually connected so that he will know how He governs them in general and in detail."72 Once Moses is enlightened from a macroscopic perspective, he understands the good that inheres in everything insofar as they "conform to their purpose". His initial gesture of humility, an acknowledgement of his own material self-limitations, gains for him in the end a global awareness of how every bit of matter interconnects to produce an all-encompassing good.13 Elisha and his ilk are also faulted by Maimonides for ignoring the ominous mishnaic warning that "He who considers four things, it would have been better had he not entered the world, what is above; what is below, what is before and what is after (ahor)"14 In his commentary to the Mishnah, Maimonides does not focus on any inherent unknowability of these subjects, nor does he consider them to be categorically occluded from any reflection whatsoever. Rather, what is the target of the mishnaic vitriol is, once again, intellectual arrogance and the pursuit of lofty dis- ciplines without the rigid prerequisite training they demand. He treats it as a criticism of those who "delve into divine matters with simple imagin- ings without having progressed through various levels of sciences ..."75 The trenchant judgment that such a person is not worthy to have ever come into existence is suited to the particular issue that has been prema- turely broached - God's governance. The consequence is the vacating of his humanity. He becomes subsumed under other species of animals which, individually, are specifically excluded from divine concern.76 72 1:54, p. 124. 73 Maimonides may very well have been sensitive to the midrashic association of Moses with tov. Within the very midrash which is chosen to justify the omission of it was good from the second day of creation there is a reference to Moses being called "good" "tov" (Bereshit Rabbah, 4: 5). R. Meir derives from the verse "And she saw that he was tov" (Exodus 2:2), that Moses' name was in fact tov (Shemot Rabbah, 1:24). The midrashic personification of tov by Moses complements the Maimonidean Moses developed here. 74Hagigah2:3 75 PHM, vol. 2, p. 378. 76 See 111:7</page><page sequence="17">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elis ha ben Abuyah 369 Elisha, and those who choose to be his acolytes, are also, according to Maimonides, subject to the second mishnaic condemnation of "He who does not have regard (literally compassion) for the honour of his Crea- tor." Once again these perpetrators are subject to the censure of "it is better that he had not entered this world."77 Inventively, Maimonides, in his mishnah commentary, identifies the honour of his Creator as the hu- man intellect and since he "does not appreciate the value of this thing that was donated to him he becomes lost to his desire and becomes like an animal."78 His offence jettisons him out of the sphere of humanity to that of the animal kingdom where God's governance is not evident. There is a double entendre in the choice of the term "honour" (kavod) here since it can allude to both the intellect with which man honours God via its perfection, and the essence of God as was pleaded for by Moses.79 Intemperate exercise of the former will lead to a perversion of the latter. Critical to a full appreciation of Maimonides' incorporation of this mishnaic excoriation within the Elisha context is the particular term that has been translated by Shlomo Pines as creator in the phrase honour of the Creator. The Hebrew term is qoneh, which literally means possessor. Its potency is emasculated by the translation creator. Qoneh is one of four terms which, according to Maimonides, biblically denote the "rela- tion between heaven and God."80 Though it signifies God's mastery over heaven and earth, it is singled out as being somewhat misleading since "it tends toward the road of the belief in the eternity of a certain mat- ter ..."81 Belief in eternity wreaks havoc with theories of divine gover- nance in the world since it is what led Aristotle to deny its application to individuals of any species including man. No equitable principle can be discerned to operate within nature since, for the Aristotelean school, there is no difference "between an ox that defecates on a host of ants so that they die, or a building whose foundations are shaken upon all the people at their prayers who are found in it so that they die."82 Random- ness and chaos prevail as far as individual man is concerned since they "exist by chance and not through the governance of one who governs."83 Reconciling apparent evil in the material world with divine justice is a 77 Supra note 108. 78 Supra note 109. 79 See 1:64, p. 157 for both these connotations. 80 II: 30, p. 358. 81 Ibid. 82 III: 17, p. 466. 83 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">370 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 futile undertaking since the two do not, by definition, share any com- mon ground of intersection. Maimonides considers this opinion to be an extension of the conviction in eternity: "this is consequent upon his opinion concerning the eternity of the world ... ."84 Therefore "not hav- ing proper regard for the qoneh6' also alludes to a failure to fully appreci- ate the relationship between God and the world as captured by this term. The implications are disastrous for perceptions of God's gover- nance in the world. To have proper regard for the glory of his qoneh is to avert its isolation from its sister terms such as baro (create) and assoh (make).85 They must be read in conjunction. Maimonides' choice of this mishnaic reference correlates Elisha's perfidy with the realms of provi- dence and governance.86 With this reference, the original "honey" metaphor has journeyed full circle. The closing comment of Maimonides' mishnah commentary is that, commensurate with its absorption, disclosure of these esoteric sub- jects such as the Account of the Chariot and the Account of Creation is also severely restricted. In support of maintaining a kind of gag order on this material, a verse from Song of Songs is cited which also incorporates the honey metaphor, "honey and milk are under your tongue" (4:11). This consummates the honey image, moving from eating honey, which is intrinsically good, to excess honey which is not good. Once the good has been imbibed it cannot be dispensed liberally. A more fitting context would be difficult to find since the next verse (12) repeats the words for locked (na'ul) and sealed (hatum) three times, while verse 13 imports the rare term pardes into its garden imagery. The pardes is virtually impenetrable both because of the formidable barriers the philosophical sophomore must overcome, and the constraints imposed on its dissemi- nation.87 Aside from its degree of obscurity, there is an additional reason why this material almost naturally becomes trapped under one's tongue. Its 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 That the reference is charged with the allusion is further corroborated by Mai- monides' citation in his mishnah commentary of the talmudic opinion which identifies the transgression of sullying the honour of one's creator with committing a sin in secrecy (Hagigah 16a). The Talmudic prooftext for this is one which connotes God's all pervasive presence to which private transgressions are an affront. The offender is likened to one who "shunts the feet of the Divine presence, for it says, "The heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool" (Isa. 66: 1). The heaven, which is God's throne, has already been identified with the araboth which has been demonstrated to be the locale from which tsedek and mishpat emanate. The reference then is further evidence of Elisha's "apostasy" on the issue of God's governance and evil. 87 See also his comments on Song of Songs 4: 11 in his Introd. to the PHM, p. 35.</page><page sequence="19">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 371 attainment is ultimately self-reflexive in purpose. Song of Songs 4: 1 1 is quoted in conjunction with another two verses in Hilkhot Yesodei Ha- Torah, mandating the shrouding of these disciplines in strictest confi- dence. One of them is most revealing for our purposes. Secrecy addresses the esoteric feature of the sciences cultivated in the pardes but it is also a natural consequence of its self serving function. "They shall be only thine alone, not to be shared with strangers" (Prov. 5:17) is cited in the Mishneh Torah alongside Song of Songs 4: 1 1 to narrowly circum- scribe the public teachings of these sciences. However, the verse lands us once again in the ultimate chapter of the Guide which expresses its preference for what constitutes the summun bonum for man. The summit of human perfection is reached intellectually with "the conception of intelligibles." It is considered so because it is purely self directed as opposed to the other three types of material, physical and moral perfec- tions. "If you consider each of the three perfections mentioned before, you will find that they pertain to others than you, not you . . . The ulti- mate perfection however, pertains to you alone, no one else being asso- ciated in it with you in any way: They shall be only thine alone and so on. " (Prov. 5: 17).88 Complementary to this latter verse is Jer. 9:22-23, averse we have encountered previously, which excludes glory from the first three perfections and exclusively reserves it for rational perfection, or the end "that he understandeth and knoweth Me."89 This knowledge in turn is identical with that procured in response to the Mosaic query, Show me now Thy ways . . . The latter comprises divine attributes of ac- tion; specifically "those actions that ought to be known and imitated are loving-kindness, judgement and righteousness."90 Behavioural assimila- tion of these as ethical virtues ineluctably flow from an all-encompassing view of how these qualities manifest themselves in the creation as a whole - the appreciation of how all existence conforms to the tov pre- viously delineated.91 The location of these attributes in the earth by Jer- 88 III: 54, p. 635. 89 Ibid., p. 636. 90 Ibid., p. 637. 91 I agree with Herbert Davidson's incisive analysis of the import of this verse which does not rank ethical virtue above intellectual virtue but rather mandates a kind of ethical conduct that automatically flows from the heights of intellectual accomplish- ment vis-à-vis knowledge of God. Jeremiah's exhortation is to model ethical conduct upon God's attributes of action as follows: "Divine loving-kindness, righteousness, and judgment, are not characteristics in the being of God, but acts executed dispassionately. Analogously, human loving-kindness, righteousness, and judgment, growing out of knowledge of God, will not be characteristics in the soul of man, but acts again exe- cuted dispassionately."

Diamond JSQ 9 emiah demonstrates "His providence extends over the earth in the way that corresponds to what the latter is ..."92 The mishnaic reference, then, dispatches the reader on a route which meanders along a series of allu- sions and references finally situating Elisha within the context of God's providence. His lack of regard for the glory of his qoneh disaffects him of the ability to discern "loving kindness, judgement, and righteousness in the earth." Maimonides takes his leave of Elisha with a parting shot at those who "regard darkness as light and light as darkness," an allusion to Isa. 5: 20, whose full text reads: "Woe to those who call the evil good and the good evil, who regard darkness as light and light as darkness, who make bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter." Added to a previous distinctions which have been blurred by Elisha of good (tov) and evil, and sweet and bitter (honey), is that of light and darkness. The distinction between light and darkness is absolutely pivotal to Maimonides' penetrating investigation of perceived evil in the world. Failure to discrepate darkness from light translates into a failure to determine their respective origins and to dis- criminate how God relates to either. Darkness, like evil, is a privation which does not require an agent and is therefore dissociated from God. To prove this proposition, Isa. 45:7 is called on where the pairs dark- ness/light and evil/peace are contrapositioned. The terms are distin- guished in the same verse by their modes of conception. Darkness and evil are products of "create" {baro) while light is "formed" (yotser). Baro "has a connection with non-being,"93 qualifying it for phenomena which are in essence privations. Baro is problematic though since it also con- notes the bringing into existence of heaven and earth.94 Baro seems to contain an implicit ambiguity which accounts for both being and non- being. Perhaps Elisha is one who sees baro effectuating a varied existence of good and bad as opposed to its genuine sense. All is tov. Tov emerges from the process indicated by baro. Matter is tov, yet its volatility and requisite state of flux entail privations. Elisha has failed to grasp the grand sweep of baro where non-being is simply a natural concomitant of being while, at the same time, bereft of any ontic status of its own. 92 Ibid. My position is that this verse and the very end of the Guide are perfectly consistent with the view expressed throughout the Guide, including this very chapter, that the summum bonum of life is intellectual perfection. For a vigorous defence of its being in the context of human conduct see Menachem Kellner, Maimonides on Human Perfection, Atlanta 1990, as well as his comprehensive bibliography on the debate which rages on. 93 111:30, p. 438. yt* See (Jen. 1: 1 and UF il: 3U, p. 3^8.</page><page sequence="21">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 373 The other principal indicator of the critical role tov plays in the Elisha debacle is R. Aqiba's anticipatory warning to his colleagues not to mis- take marble for water. According to Maimonides, R. Aqiba has identi- fied what is most vexing about day number two of the creation - the division of waters by the firmament, and specifically, the overhead waters. R. Aqiba's caution is taken as counsel to prevent confusing what is water in name alone with the liquid substance empirically known to man.95 Through sharing a common matter, water is divided into three entirely distinct forms which occupy the firmament, the earth, and the suprafirmament96. What is most conspicuous about the account of the second day in Genesis is the missing appraisal, that it was good, so char- acteristic of the other days. The omission, we are told, caters to public perception which cannot fathom the existence or the utility of this crea- tion for "it is a matter whose meaning is hidden and that, understood in its external meaning does not exist in such a way as to appear useful; what utility externally visible to the people at large could there be so that the words, that it was good could be said with reference to it?" Intrinsi- cally good, yet extrinsically unpalatable, this water is a confounding substance. Assumedly, the failure of Elisha to abide by Aqiba's advice has landed him in the company of a mass misapprehension. He remains at the level of the external where tov is absent. Once again, it is a tov that has not been absorbed, which, as we shall see, reflects both an ethical and intellectual offence that are mirror images of each other. Mention of a group whose confusion is marked by an incapacity to distinguish between light and darkness guides the reader back to R. Aqiba's water, water forewarning. As pointed out, Maimonides con- strues that caution as a direct reference to the variant forms of water situated above and below the firmament. Their segregation which tran- spires in Gen. 1:7 sequentially follows the demarcation between light and darkness in Gen 1 : 4, both of which are realized through the same divine action of dividing (vayavdel). Consequently, Maimonides draws a parallel between the two, "Thus the phrase, And he divided between the waters which were under the firmament, etc., is analogous to the phrase, And God divided between the light and the darkness, in which the division 95 Ibid., 11:30 p. 353 See Sara Klein-Braslavy's, discussion of the various hypotheses regarding the identity of the suprafirmament waters in Maimonides ' Interpretation of the Story of Creation (Heb.), Jerusalem 1978, pp. 160-174. 96 For a survey of the debate among the medievais concerning the nature of the waters above the firmament (e. g. are they crystalline, ice, etc.?) see Edward Grant, Planets, Stars and Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos 1200-1687, Cambridge 1996, pp. 103- 104, 332-334.</page><page sequence="22">374 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 is in respect of a certain form."97 The root error of the confused group of Isa. 5:20 who mistake darkness for light and vice versa can be traced to a misapprehension of the primal division which distinguished the two in Gen. 1:4. Division is the process of informing air with light and its absence leaves darkness in its wake. Light, though, being a product of yetsirah (forming), is an accident of shape as indicated by the verse cited above: "Who formeth (yotser) the light" (Isa. 45:7). Full appreciation of the process exemplified by Gen. 1:4 is a prerequisite for the proper sense of the water's division in 1:7. What is mandatory for mastering the notion of tov is a proficiency in the working of nature, its origins and its rudimentary components of form, matter, essence, accident and pri- vation. In the final analysis we have still not unearthed what exactly Maimon- ides finds so "most hidden" about R. Aqiba's waters caution, nor what lends it the complexion of an "extraordinary secret."98 Whatever the identity of this substance beyond the firmament is, my concern is more conceptual than technical. Others such as Sarah Klein-Braslavy have competently surveyed the various schools of thought on this thorny issue.99 My intention is not to enter the debate but rather to underscore 97 Ibid., p. 352. "Darkness" (hoshekh) in this verse means that which is empirically experienced as night or the absence of light as opposed to the elemental fire of Gen. 1:2. For these equivocal meanings of hoshech see p. 351, "In view of the fact that the term darkness {hoshekh) as employed in the first place (Gen. 1:2) which designates the element, differs in its meaning from the term darkness, as employed afterwards in the signification of obscurity, it begins to explain and differentiate, saying "And the hoshekh He called night. " 98 Ibid., p. 353. For a striking example of the way in which Maimonides rationalis- tic interpretations were transformed into mystical allegories see Abraham Abulafia's version of Maimonides on this "water, water" episode as discussed by Alexander Alt- mann in "Maimonides' Attitude Toward Jewish Mysticism", Religious Truth and Phi- losophical Quest, 1980, pp. 200-219 at p. 208, "...this does not mean a distinction between celestial and terrestrial matter - that is, a mere cosmologicla gradation - but the full breakthrough of the mystic conception of an ontological dualism." If José Faur is correct on "water, water" bearing sexual connotations (see Vayikra Rabbah 23:3) then the signifier corresponds to its signified or of confusion between form and matter. Matter, in Maimonides, is very often depicted in feminine terms as in I: 6, 7, 14 and particularly III: 8. There the relationship between matter and form is analogized to that between an unfaithful wife and her husband. Just as she "never ceases to seek for another man to substitute for her husband" so does matter, "whatever form is found in it, does but prepare it to receive another form" (p. 431). The "water, water" expres- sions then captures the sexual infidelities of matter to form.

One of the most insightful of the medieval commentators on this passage is Asher Cresças who senses the danger of exploring this level of existence in its ramifications for public perceptions of divine gover- nance and providence. According to him the aura of mystery surround- ing these waters is due to the real threat that, "they will imagine that the downfall of the rains are natural events and not the direct acts of God, and this will lead to the alienation of divine providence from their belief systems."100 He continues that, because rain plays such a central role in the biblical reward/punishment paradigm, unimpeded disclosure of its natural origins and mechanistic formation at the suprafirmament stage would seriously threaten cardinal tenets of theological belief. This chal- lenge to public perception is, I believe, hinted at by the light/darkness reference of Isa. 5:20. Immediately after discussing the hiddenness of day number two of creation he traces the causal progression from the spheres to the world of generation and passing away to its primary source - light and darkness. These interact to generate various "meteor- ological phenomena among which rain figures." The causal links are traced from that point to "the final composition being that of man."101 Rain figures most prominently in both the origins and suste- nance of man. Knowledge of sequential causation with its inception in the permutations of light and darkness and subsequent generation of rain may obviate the notion of an interested God who acts in the world. The naive, yet necessary, beliefs of the general public102 may become unhinged as a result. 100 See Moreh Nebukhim, Heb. trans. Solomon ibn Tibbon, (Jerusalem, 1960), part II, p. 60a-60b. and Braslavy, supra, n. 129 who cites Cresças approvingly. The English translation is mine. 101 11:30, p. 354. See also 11:48 p. 410 where the point is made that prophetic lan- guage which attributes all material and moral events directly to God omits all the proximate natural series of causation between God and that phenomenon. A potent illustration of that prophetic trope is rain. 102 The chapter immediately preceding Maimonides' treatment of evil, 111:9, dwells on the human condition's inescapable handicap of matter, the perennial obstruction to a panoramic view of God. Numerous biblical citations are afforded whose imagery has God ensconced in darkness (hoshekh), reaching its apogee with the Sinaitic theophany itself where God is enveloped in both darkness and rain. This image, of course, is restricted to the matter-biased perspective of man. However, the divine reality resides in "dazzling light, the overflow of which illumines all that is dark". The prooftext for the latter reality is: "And the earth did shine with His glory" (Kavod) (Ezek. 43:2). Kavod is the counterbalance to man's hoshekh. When contemplating the darkness of matter, if man is not mindful of the light of Kavod then the equilibrium is shattered and he "does not have proper regard for the Kavod of his Creator."</page><page sequence="24">376 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 This potential danger is enhanced by another destination in the Guide to which the light/darkness reference leads. In 11:5 Maimonides ad- vances the proposition that governance of all created beings is processed through the spheres. In support of his thesis he cites Gen. 1: 18 "And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide, etc.," which is then intricately linked to the jurisdiction of the forces emanating from light and darkness; "Now, the meaning of ruling is domination through governance: and this is a supplementary notion added to that of light and darkness, which is the proximate cause of generation and corruption. For the meaning of light and darkness is referred to in the words: And to divide the light from the darkness (Gen 1:18)"103 The confusion regarding light and darkness of Isa. 5:20 is a confusion about origins; about natural causation conceived with the spheres and funnelled through light and darkness and rain down to humanity; about form and privation of form; about the drama of generation and corrup- tion within the divine scheme of governance. Elisha' s grandiose ambi- tions beyond his capacity condemn him to a theological morass which fails to account for the remoteness God has been consigned to by this scheme. He cannot extricate himself from a world abandoned to the ravages of rampant and random evil. In the end Elisha and Aqiba become the existential embodiments of their respective theological perspectives on God and the world. Elisha's failure to situate evil within a context of overall tov philosophically dis- tances God from the world and leaves him alienated in turn from the ultimate source of all being. His sobriquet of Aher resonates with the sense oïahor offered by Onkelos, and positions him experientially within the same habitat to which he has relegated the rest of existence, "the beings from which I have, as it were, turned away, and upon which, speaking in parables, I have turned My back because of their remoteness from the existence of God, may He be exalted."104 This is the back (ahor) at which Elisha/aher has arrived and is the back which is the consequence of God's hiding of the face of Deut. 31: 17-18. Exposure to this turning of God's back causes men to be, in the words of the verse, devoured, and many evil and troubles shall come upon them. Maimonides' interpretation of this hiding of the face aptly captures the existential predicament in which Elisha now finds himself, "... the reason for a hu- 103 II: 5, p. 261. 104 1: 37, p. 86.</page><page sequence="25">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 3ΊΊ man individual's being abandoned to chance so that he is permitted to be devoured by the beasts is his being separated from God."105 Aqiba, on the other hand, "enters in peace (shalom) and exits in peace." His warning about the waters above the firmament adumbrates the danger posed by this region from which he will be shielded because he is armed with the defence of peace (shalom). What does this shalom signify? If we revert back to the instrumental verse who forms light and creates darkness, who makes peace (shalom) and creates evil (ra'J, to which attention was summoned by the confusion of light with darkness citation, two problems arise. First the natural polarity which would con- stitute a common contrasting pair would be tov (good) and ra' (evil). Shalom appears in tov 's stead. Secondly, what Maimonides finds most appealing about this verse is the deliberate pairing of baro with priva- tions of darkness and evil as opposed to making (asoh) "for these are not existing things with which the word making would be connected."106 Furthermore the term making connotes "specific forms that were given to them [heaven + earth]- 1 mean their nature."107 How then can making produce a conception or notion such as peace! Shalom, the understudy for tov in this context, represents an accom- plished appreciation of tov in the creation. Tov advances the principle of conformity to purpose including natural degeneration, corruption and deficiencies associated with matter. Everything operates in tandem and purposefully, including what is perceived as evil, yielding a pervasive harmony or peace. Once tov is procured, no conflict, tension or friction exists between all the facets of existence, most certainly not on the plane in which asoh (making) is operative, that of natural, or essential, forms. The forms coexist idyllically. Guided by this outlook prior to embarking upon his contemplative Odyssey ensures a successful return with his sha- lom intact.108 His robust grip on what shalom represents entrenches God's relationships with the world, however remote it seems. In contra- 105 See 111:51, p. 626. 106 III: 10, p. 438. »ο7 ΪΤ-10 η 158 los when addressing the omission of it was good from the second day of Creation, Maimonides favours the midrashic solution that the creation of water was incomplete at that stage. This reason is qualified as "the best statement of its kind," but not necessarily the sole acceptable one. Particularly apt for R. Aqiba's "peaceful"entry and return and cognizance of his own "water, water" warning is the midrashic opinion attributing the "good" omission to the conflict and tension introduced into the world that day as evidenced by the "division" of the waters (the sense is divisiveness"). But of course this is only a perceived not good and so Aqiba, by placing each water in its proper context, resolves the conflict, sees the ultimate tov and therefore returns in "peace" {shalom).</page><page sequence="26">378 James Α. Diamond JSQ 9 distinction to Elisha then, Aqiba is the existential model of God's pres- ence since "he has rendered himself so worthy that the intellect in ques- tion overflows toward him, has providence attached to him, while all evils are prevented from befalling him."109 This invincible state of being acquired by those who have achieved intellectual perfection is substan- tiated by a prooftext where peace (shalom) is adopted as its chief trope: "Aquaint now thyself and be with Him and be at peace" (Job 22:21). The verse translates into the counsel, "turn toward Him and you will be safe from all ill."110 Aqiba, then, is the personification of this state of shalom attained as a result of perceiving how all existence, including the defects of matter, manifest a state of shalom. Preoccupied with shalom as an operative rationale for the creation, he personally embodies shalom, which shields him from all evils, since they are gagged within the context ofthat rationale. God does not hide His face (Deut. 31: 17-18) from the likes of Aqiba. Instead he is presented with the back, which "has come to be like Me, and follows necessarily from My will."111 The tov which Elisha fails to grasp is the tov omitted from the account of the second day of Creation, not because it is not tov, but because it bears an esoteric doctrine regarding God and his relationship to the world. The wanting tov, so mysteriously absent from the second day, lends it the identical format in which any esoteric matter is to be taught. Indeed, it parallels the very structure of the Guide itself. His description of his own esotericism and that of the divine author in the composition of the second day's account are striking analogues: a) Guide - "The seventh cause - In speaking about very obscure mat- ters it is necessary to conceal some parts and to disclose others ... In such cases the vulgar must in no way be aware of the contradiction; the author accordingly uses some device to conceal it by all means."112 b) Torah - (regarding the missing tov of the second day) "If, on the other hand, the matter is considered according to its inner meaning and to what was truly intended, it is most hidden. For in that case it was necessary for it to be one of the concealed secrets so that the vulgar should not know it."113 Elisha, in his haste, has fallen prey to the conspicuously missing tov whose reinsertion the text demands of its accomplished readers. 109 111:51, p. 626. uuIbid. 111 1:38, p. 87. 112 GP, Introd., p. 18. 113 Ibid., 11:30, p. 353.</page><page sequence="27">(2002) A Maimonidean Recasting of Elisha ben Abuyah 379 Maimonides has applied creative hermeneutics whereby a novel con- struct of Elisha emerges out of a melange of biblical and rabbinic proof- texts. Each reference draws the reader across the spectrum of the Guide, the Mishneh Torah and mishnah commentary to present him in an arro- gant, hubristic and premature attempt at forging a coherent theodicy. Failure is ruinous, not only for a routed theodicy, but for whatever Elisha has previously intellectually accomplished. The pith of his egre- gious error has been tracked to an incapacity to assimilate the full pur- port of the tov of creation. It now behooves us, at the conclusion of our study, to return to the core talmudic text and accommodate this new hermeneutical construct of Elisha in our rereading of it. Having dealt with the debacle of the pardes journey my concern is how to approach its aftermath. For the purpose of this study it is one feature of the version in the Palestinian Talmud on which I wish to focus114 the series of encounters with Elisha's disciple, R. Meir, who remains inside the rabbinic fold while his master has crossed the line. The first of these encounters consists of exegetical jousting between the former teacher and his pupil regarding the meaning of various bib- lical phrases. The last of them is a posthumous one where R. Meir becomes a compelling advocate for his master in the face of God's cruel and unusual punishment of Elisha in the afterlife. What is quite striking is that these two confrontations, marking the beginning and the end of the Meir/Elisha cycle, both pivot on the key term tov. In the former case the debate focuses on the meaning of the apothegm, "The end of a thing is better (tov) than its beginning" (Eccles 7:8). In the latter, at the sight of Elisha's smoldering grave, R. Meir adduces a number of verses in a daring challenge to God's verdict. Exploiting Ruth 3:13, the sexually charged scene on the threshing floor between Boaz and Ruth, R. Meir assumes the voice of Boaz, "Stay the night, then in the morning if he will redeem you good (tov)" (Ruth 3: 13) - this refers to the Holy One Blessed be He, who is good (tov) as it says, He is good, to all, and his mercy upon all creatures (Ps. 145:9). But if He does not want to redeem you I will redeem you myself, as God lives" (Ruth 3:13). The Meir/Elisha cycle revolves around Meir, who remains on the inside, attempting to draw Elisha, who is outside, back in. According to his Maimonidean con- 114 Chronologically the editing process of the Palestinian Talmud predates the Bab- ylonian Talmud and Shamma Friedman has documented how the Bavli literally re- worked the Palestinian aggadot by revising and supplementing in accordance with its own agenda.

Diamond JSQ 9 struct, Elisha is outside because of the missing or misconceived tov. It is appropriate then that Meir's encounters with Elisha are guided by at- tempts to refine the meaning of tov and reintroduce the tov personified by the deity himself. In fact, Ps. 145:9 is the very verse cited in the Guide 's discussion of evil to convey God's ultimate beneficence and mu- nificence, "For His bringing us into existence is absolutely the great good ... ."115 Redemption for Elisha lies in assimilating the full import of God as tov and so Meir sagaciously resorts to it to quell his master's purgation. God, according to Maimonides, is imported into the world via a recognition of His "goodness" in the creation and, once this was declared by Meir on his master's behalf, "the fire was extinguished." 115 GP, 111:12, p. 448.</page></plain_text>
