On the basis of a shared assumption that social understandings of the body were created and reproduced through associations with material culture, archaeology of the body has proceeded from two theoretical positions: the body as the scene of display and the body as artifact. Today, the body as a site of lived experience, a social body, and site of embodied agency, is replacing prior static conceptions of an archaeology of the body as a public, legible surface.

Ar chaeology, although coming late to this topic, has begun to make critical contributions to writing about the body. With its grounding in the materiality of human experience, ar chaeology offers to scholarship on the body a unique perspective anchored in bodily phys icality. As a discipline that emphasizes repe tition over time as the basis for recognizing culturally intelligible practices, archaeology outlines ways that different forms of embodi ment were historically produced, reproduced, and transformed. At the same time, archaeol ogists are intensely aware of the gap that exists between the materiality of the traces of past human experience and the interpretations of those traces that they propose. Archaeologi cal inquiry into the body thus foregrounds the challenges for wider scholarship, both within anthropology and outside it, inherent in the move from apparently solid physical facts to social and cultural understandings. Explicit archaeological discussion of em bodiment is relatively recent, despite the fact that archaeologists have long offered inter pretations of material they recover that imply body practices, body ideals, and differential experiences of the body. Introducing a re cent edited volume, Rautman &amp; Talalay (2000, p. 2) identify two well-established senses of the archaeological body: on the one hand, the "physical or skeletal components that de fine the human species" "seen as a record of ancient diet, health, life span, and physical activities," and on the other, representations through which "cultural ideas of maleness and femaleness, masculinity and femininity, are played out." Neither of these senses of the ar chaeological body is particularly new. Classic archaeological works regularly identified cer tain objects as body ornaments and discussed the potential or actual uses of other objects in body practices. Archaeologists drew on repre sentations of human beings to propose inter pretations of idealized beauty; social signs of age, status, and gender; and other aspects of embodiment. Archaeological excavations rou tinely brought to light human remains, whose identification as sexed, aged, and raced bodies in fact dominated the archaeological literature of the body through the 1980s. Starting in the 1990s, and accelerating during the past five years, the topics of ar chaeological publications concerned with em bodiment have diversified. At the same time, the pace of publication on long-established topics in archaeology of the body has inten sified. Three trends are evident over time. First, a dramatic rise in the frequency of ar chaeological articles explicitly concerned with the body in a sample of anthropological jour nals, from an average of one per year before 1990 to almost six per year after that date, is evident (Table 1). This increase may be attributed to the development of postproces sual critiques in archaeology that emphasized redressing the previous lack of attention to human agency and aspects of identity, such as gender, closely tied to archaeological re search on the body (Brumfiel 1992). However, simultaneously, the frequency of articles con cerned with the body, considered from the H J yce</page><page sequence="3">TABLE 1 Journal articles from 1965 to 2004 on archaeology of the body1 Main thematic emphasis Physical anthropology Ornament, dress Representation Body practices Total N Explicit theory 16 25 12 25 15 13 38 16 24 64 30 114 aBased on a sample of journal articles yielded by a search of the key words "body," "embodi*" and "archaeolog* " on Anthropology Plus, an index combining Tozzer Library's Anthropological Literature and the Anthropological Index of the Royal Anthropological Institute. This sample was compared with results from a similar search of Web of Science/Web of Knowledge, which resulted in the addition of two more recent articles to the sample. Individual articles were classified according to the dominant thematic concerns, and a separate count was made of articles proposing theoretical approaches to embodiment. Some of the latter articles did not have an obvious thematic emphasis other than theoretical discussion. Although the selection of publications that are indexed means that this is not a complete survey of the literature, it is a uniform sample of major journals in the field over time and so does serve to show trends over time. These data should not be used as indications of the total number of articles on these topics. perspective of bioarchaeology, has sharply in creased, and these contributions are in no obvious way postprocessual. Both positivist and interpretive archaeologists have found the body to be an increasingly compelling subject during the past 15 years. What is most distinctive about the most re cent archaeological literature concerning the body is the degree to which interpretations are being grounded in social theory, both from within anthropology and outside it. Articles that explicitly theorize archaeological engage ment with embodiment become common af ter 1990 (Table 1). Phenomenology, femi nist theory, and the work of Foucault have all been influential in archaeology of the body (Fisher &amp; Loren 2003, Golden &amp; Toohey 2003, Hamilakis et al. 2002, Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003, Montserrat 1998, Rautman 2000). In creasingly, as is the case with other anthropo logical work on embodiment, archaeologists are finding it necessary to clarify the assump tions they make in moving from theorizing perception to attempting to understand expe rience. Archaeology, which approaches both perception and experience through those ma terial traces that survive over time, contributes a unique dimension to anthropologies of embodiment. This review connects the contemporary ar chaeology of the body to earlier archaeologi cal concern with the symbolic communication of identity through body ornaments and cos tume. Following Grosz (1995, p. 104), I view the body as a "concrete, material, animate organization of flesh, organs, nerves, skele tal structure and substances, which are given a unity and cohesiveness through psychical and social inscription of the body's surface." Archaeological interest in the surface of the body was closely linked to the rise of archae ologies of sex and gender, seen as inscribed in dress, ornamentation, and body modifi cation (Marcus 1993, 1996; Sorensen 1991, 2000). The demonstration that constructions of sexed/gendered bodies are always simul taneously constructions of age, class, ethnic ity, race, and social status has shifted the at tention of archaeologists to a wider gamut of practices shaping embodied personhood www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body 141</page><page sequence="4">(Joyce 2004, Meskell 2001). Some archaeo logical analyses reflexively relate bodily prac tices to representational practices through which images were produced that served both as models for embodiment and as commemo ration of selected experiences of embodiment (Clark 2003, Hill 2000, Joyce 1998). Some archaeological analyses argue that represen tational practices literally expanded the site of the embodied person, incorporating rep resentations, spaces, and items of costume in the person, even when these items were re moved from direct bodily contact (Gillespie 2001, 2002; Houston &amp; Stuart 1998; Looper 2003a,b). Contemporary archaeological considera tion of the complex relationships between body practices and practices of representation shows that the concept of an easily defined body "surface" at the boundary between an interiorized person and exteriorized society is problematic (Looper 2003a). Archaeologi cal exploration, using bioarchaeological tech niques, of the ways in which habitual practices and dispositions literally shape flesh and bones (Boyd 1996) further questions the isolation of a public, inscriptional body surface cover ing an uninterpreted physical interior because the biological person is both the medium and product of social action. Today, to invoke an archaeology of the body's surface is to place in question automatically the body, the per son, and relations between embodied persons in society. FROM BODY ORNAMENTS TO ORNAMENTED BODIES Costume, body ornaments, and representa tions of costume in artworks have long been used by archaeologists as evidence of distinct statuses on the basis of an implicit understand ing of the surface of the body as public. As Robb (1998, p. 332) notes, under the "in formation transnlission,, view of the symbolic functions of artifacts (Wobst 1977), archae ologists assumed that objects conveyed rel atively clear meanings within their cultures of origin. Many of those assumed meanings were concerned with identity. This assump tion continues to be part of contemporary research in archaeology. For example, Lee (2000, pp. 114-15) explicitly bases her discus sion of Minoan representations of masculine and feminine bodies on the assumption that "dress functions as a primary means of non verbal communication" emitting "constant, complex social messages that would have been intended by the wearer and understandable by the viewer" (p. 114). From this perspective body ornaments are understood as marking already-given aspects of social status of the individual person, or as media for the communication of given social identities. The assumption that spe cific costumes corresponded to different cat egories of persons in the past meant that a person's social status and history could be "read off" the body. There is a strong con nection between discussions of costume and identity and the archaeology of economically and socially stratified societies (Anawalt 1981, Kuttruff 1993). As a result, some of the most significant discussions in archaeology of the marking of the body surface originated in studies of political economy, tracing links be tween the relations of production and the ef fectiveness of costume in marking differential status. Peregrine (1991) reviewed the history of archaeological arguments for the significance of costume ornaments as indications of spe cific social statuses in societies with "prestige goods economies." Noting that costume or naments were commonly employed in cer emonies of social reproduction, Peregrine stated an interpretation shared by other ar chaeologists interested in pursuing the con nection between social reproduction and the production of embodied persons. Hayden (1998) suggested that such objects were par ticularly important in societies at this level of integration because of the significance of social displays in building individualized sta tus for "aggrandizers," the minority of peo ple in a society who seek to distinguish 142 Joyce</page><page sequence="5">themselves from others for their own eco nomic benefit. A recent analysis of Hohokam shell body ornaments thus concludes that these were "material symbols of group mem bership and identity" and "insignia of office," simultaneously signifying identification with a group and distinctions within it (Bayman 2002, p. 70). All these authors replicate, and several ex plicitly cite, the logic of Earle's (1987) ground breaking work on specialization and wealth in Hawaiian and Inka societies, which con sidered the links between precious materials incorporated in distinctive costume items like Hawaiian feather cloaks and the social statuses and roles signified by such costume. Earle ar gued that Hawaiian cloaks were in fact mate rial signs of status. Commenting on Inka use of cloth and of metal and shell ornaments in costume, he argued that different costumes vi sually distinguished different ranks within this complex society. Discussions of costume and identity based on the information transmission model are not limited to studies of chiefdoms and early states. White (1992, p. 539) explicitly consid ered why objects like body ornaments were products of the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, a period of innovation in "the material con struction and representation of meaning" (see also White 1989). White (1992), like Wobst (1977), argued that highly visible marks in corporated in costume would be widely in terpretable within a community. In his view, "personal ornaments, perhaps more than any other aspect of the archaeological record, are a point of access for archaeologists into the social world of the past" (White 1992, p. 539). Following Weiner (1992), White (1992, p. 541) drew attention to the potential for or naments made of durable materials to persist beyond a single human life span, creating in tergenerational continuity in identities and social distinctions, and to exteriorize asser tions about social identity that might be more controversial or contested as verbal state ments, like the claims of power and veiled threats of military might that Earle (1987) suggested were made by wearing Hawaiian feather cloaks. These long-established assumptions about the relation of body ornament and identity continue to be influential in archaeological re search. More recent work considers these re lationships as products of active construction of identity, not simply as signaling of inde pendently existing identities (Fisher &amp; Loren 2003). Attention is focused on the degree of intentionality that can be assumed in the use of costume and the way that costume serves to perpetuate embodied identities. Stone (2003) notes that archaeologists today are divided about the degree of consciousness required for the use of material culture as symbols of eth nic identity. Personal ornaments or distinc tive costume can be understood as desirable media of identity when self-consciousness is assumed because they could be displayed or not as situations warranted. Taking a sim ilar perspective, intergenerational transmis sion of body ornaments in Mesoamerica has been interpreted as a means of recreating embodied personhood within a line of re lated persons (Joyce 1998, 2003a; Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003). Exemplifying such recent work, Bazelmans (2002) argues that differences in dress represented in medieval burials index a complex interplay of religious and class-based intentions and understandings. Treating the body as a "cultural project," Bazelmans (2002, p. 73) attends closely to the use in burial ritu als of "items which feed, intoxicate, and dress the body" not simply as reflections of a co herent "identity," but as informative about the enactment of embodiment in mortuary contexts. The assumption that the visibility of items of dress contributes to the public legibility of a personal history remains a productive part of contemporary archaeological analy sis (Isaza Aizpurua &amp; McAnany 1999; Joyce 1999,2002a; Loren 2003). The textualization of the body's surface is increasingly viewed as a more or less deliberate social strategy through which embodied identities were shaped, not simply signaled. www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body 143</page><page sequence="6">Inscribing the Body's Surface Citing Turner's (1980) concept of "the so cial skin," White (1992) identified archaeo logical body ornaments as demarcating and inscribing the body's surface as the point of articulation between an interior self and an exterior society, between a physical body and its symbolically transformed social presenta tion. Turner's work was influential on many archaeologists who began in the early 1990s to explore the way that artifacts preserved in archaeological sites could be used to construct an understanding of the social processes of embodiment in past human societies (Fisher &amp; Loren 2003, Joyce 1998, Loren 2001). Work on the social inscription of the body's surface eventually led to archaeological cri tiques of an easy assumption of a distinction between skin and what lies "beneath," of the collapse of "the body" into surface represen tation in place of concern with the experience of embodiment (compare Csordas 1994, pp. 9-12; Grosz 1994, pp. 115-121). One reason for the early dominance of studies of the ar chaeological body as an inscribed surface was the dependence on visual images, literally in scribed surfaces, as a proxy for living bodies (Joyce 1996, Shanks 1995). As analyses pro gressed, researchers identified difficulties with the original model that equated stable and sin gular identities with categorical sets of mark ings of the body's surface. Sorensen (1991) exemplifies the initial ap proach to archaeological understanding of the body as a product of costuming acts. In her influential analysis, she proposed that gen der difference was signaled through standard ized forms of dress. The implication that gen der identity was preexisting, expressed in, but not formed by, acts of dressing, was unset tled by the framing of the argument as about the "construction" of gender. An assumed sta bility of bodily identity, broadly endorsed in archaeology at the time, also supported dis cussions of cross-dressing or impersonation across lines of gender-specific costuming that produced a contradictory implication of a dis junction between the body surface and in teriority (Arnold 1991, Stone 1991). Thus, although framed initially in terms of the sig naling of a stable, preexisting, essential iden tity, work published and presented at confer ences during this period quickly raised key issues that required archaeologists interested in embodied identity to rethink their analytic frameworks. Yates (1993) used a detailed study of an thropomorphic images in Scandinavian rock art as a platform for an early attempt to the orize the body. The norm then (and even today) was to identify as masculine figures with apparent phallic features, and as feminine those that lacked such marks. Yates under scored that this view of sexual identity as based on having or lacking a phallus was rooted in contemporary western European understand ings of sexed subjectivity. Wanting to under stand how other understandings of gender might be represented in schematic anthro pomorphic figures, he found it necessary to reconsider the ontology of the subject of rep resentation. His resolution of the challenge he faced was to view the body as "a plain over which the grid is laid in order to mark certain points of focus and intensity_the body... begins life as a featureless plateau a plane of consistency or 'body without organs' to use Deleuze and Guattari's terms onto which signs are written by culture_The or gans and their associated meanings are applied onto this plain by a process of cultural inscrip tion" (Yates 1993, p. 59). This proposal neatly made the data available (inscribed rock sur faces) homologous with the theorized body. It exposed the inadequacy of archaeological views shaped by engagement with inert im ages and dead bodies, of the body as a pas sive thing waiting to be marked with signs of meaning. In contrast with approaches that assumed a uniform, transhistorical role of body mark ings, ornament, and dress as signal, more recent archaeological work seeks to situate body practices and representational practices historically in relation to the production of 144 J yce</page><page sequence="7">different embodied experiences. Rainbird (2002) argues that tattooing needs to be un derstood as the inscription of a history on the body, a "wrapping in images" that does not just mark but actually forms the skin of the person. Tattooing, an irreversible mod ification of the skin identified archaeologi cally both directly (Alvrus et al. 2001, Barber 1999) and indirectly (Green 1979, Rainbird 2002, Thompson 1946), raises interesting questions about the archaeological interpre tation of marks on the body's surface. Literally demarcating the skin, tattoos and related body practices (such as scarification or body pierc ing) create permanent marks, unlike the use of clothing or ornaments, which can be adopted or changed more easily. Practices like tattoo ing require explicit consideration of the sig nificance to bodily identity of the interplay of permanence and impermanence (Grosz 1994, pp. 138-44). The fluidity of embodiment has been addressed in recent archaeological dis cussions of bodily performance and expe rience that consider the substantive impact that archaeologically invisible body practices, such as habitual patterns of dress and orna ment, would have had on the experience of embodiment. Boyd (2002, p. 142) has critically sum marized the implications of much traditional archaeological research on body ornamenta tion: "[B]ody decoration is seen as part of a representational formulation of the body. Decorative elements symbolically represent particular ideas, particular subjective mean ings, which are materially inscribed' on the body in order to convey those ideas and mean ings. However, the body itself remains an ob ject, only given meaning through the use of decoration." As he notes, the limited view of inscription here ignores the already-existing history of the embodied person. Acknowledg ing this prior history, he suggests that the ar raying of the dead body in Natufian burials in the Levant be viewed as "a practice relating to perceptions of the body.. .bodily action by the living on the bodies of the dead" (Boyd 2002, p. 142). In a similarly critical study of standard practices in burial analysis, Gilchrist (1997, pp. 47-50) noted that in a sample of me dieval cemeteries in England "weapons were associated with men with the tallest stature and strongest physique" (p. 49). She suggested that weapons here make less sense as signals of male gender than as traces of the embod ied experience of certain men as warriors, experience whose effects penetrated to the bone. Archaeological analysis, as it is increas ingly evident, can tell us about the embod ied life of deceased persons, but only through an understanding of the reflexive relations between body practices, perceptions, and ex perience among persons. Contemporary ar chaeologists move beyond the textualization of the body's surface and call attention to the discernable effects of the use of ornaments or styles of dress on the experience of the person whose body is literally shaped by a manner of dress. PERFORMING THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL BODY Archaeologists interested in linking material media, including representations, to embod ied experience have built on Butler's analy ses (1990, 1993) of the ways that the physical characteristics of the body are given so cial meaning through repetitive performance (Perry &amp; Joyce 2001). Contrasting fundamen tally with the beginning point of the informa tion signaling model of dress, analyses draw ing on Butler's work begin from the position that "there is no atemporal, fixed 'core' to a person's identity.. .outside the acts and ges tures that constitute it" (Alberti 2001, p. 190). From this perspective representations of the body can be seen as records of stereotyped em bodied performances that served as models, or in Butler's terms citational precedents, for the embodied gestures of living people (Bachand et al. 2003; Joyce 1993,1998, 2001b,c, 2002a, 2003a,b; Joyce &amp; Hendon 2000). The fleeting performativity of living bod ies can be traced archaeologically through www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body 145</page><page sequence="8">reflexivity between representations and the use in body practices of objects like those represented floyce 1993,1998,2001b). An ex tended analysis of stereotyped human repre sentations in small, hand-modeled figurines of the Honduran Playa de los Muertos cul ture culminated in the proposal that these highly detailed, individualized images would have served as intimate sources of bodily precedents for the young women who are the majority of identified subjects (Joyce 2002 a, 2003 b). By relating ornaments depicted at particular bodily sites (the hair, ears, neck, wrists, and ankles) to durable objects recov ered archaeologically, including from burials, it was possible to argue that specific figurai images were likely idealized representations of persons of different ages. What could not be discerned from the durable traces in ar chaeological sites were the stereotyped pos tures associated with different ages, standing or dancing with young women, seated pos tures with older individuals. Nor did the ar chaeological remains include any way to ob serve the diversity of treatment of hair within each age-related group of figures. By tacking back and forth between the representations and the archaeologically recovered durable objects, this study argued for both citation ality of age-specific bodily postures and prac tices of dress, and for individuality within even the highly stereotyped representations. Bas ing this analysis on the framework provided by Butler (1993), it was argued that both the fig urines and the living bodies that surrounded children were sources of bodily ideals against which they would have measured their own embodied performances. The greater dura bility of the figurai representations, and the differential durability of some body practices, would have made these more effective in the long-term reproduction of specific forms of embodiment, even over multiple generations (Joyce 2000a, 2001c, 2003a). Other archaeological analyses similarly juxtapose bodily performance and representa tion, now seen not simply as documentary but as disciplinary or normative. German (2000, pp. 102-4) asks how representations of the human form on seals from the late Bronze Age Aegean could inform us about the cor poral bodies of human subjects. Noting that despite the inclusion of highly specific details, the bodies depicted are ultimately not real istic in proportion, and are selective in their presentation of bodily architecture, she un derlines the homogeneity of classes of bodies in representation. Citing Butler (1990), she suggests that these seals present specific em bodied actions as conventional gender per formances seen in details of differential body positioning as much as in the specific ac tivities each gender was presumed to carry out (German 2000, pp. 104-5). Palka (2002) builds on a scrupulously detailed analysis of visual representations of human figures to ar gue for both experiential and symbolic di mensions of handedness among the Classic Maya. Emphasis on performativity contributes to more critical examination of items of dress that previously have been viewed sim ply as reflections of categories of people. Thus Danielsson (2002) denaturalizes the singling out of the head in Scandinavian traditions of the use of helmets and head ornaments, re lating the use of these items to the isolation of the face as a figurai motif in art. Arguing that the use of helmets and head ornaments and the representation of isolated faces need to be understood in terms of "masking" as a cultural practice, Danielsson (2002, p. 181) suggests that "masks enable embodiment of disembodied states," transformative perfor mances during the life course. Work on Cen tral American societies also identified a rela tionship between emphasis on the head as the site of identity in representational images and actual practices of dress and ornamentation, including masking, through which the head was shaped and inflected in life (Joyce 1998). Explicitly grounding the analysis in the the oretical work of Butler (1990, 1993), these studies argued that specific body practices were part of a repertoire of charged perfor mances that marked transitions during the life 146 Joyce</page><page sequence="9">course in prehispanic Central America (Joyce 2000a). Beginning with concern with the body as a site of representation and a represented object, archaeologists working on the rela tions of costume, body ornament, and body practices have been led to engage with more phenomenological approaches to the experi ence of the persons whose bodies were liter ally shaped by these practices (Joyce 2003a, Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003). Under the influence of approaches to archaeology that emphasize the importance of cross-cutting dimensions of social identity and the active negotiation of so cial positions, scholars interested in embodi ment have begun to draw on other lines of evi dence to flesh out flat and Stereotypie views of bodies in past societies derived from norma tive representations. Through examination of traces of body modification that would have affected the exteriority of the body, evident in human skeletal remains, archaeologists have begun to raise questions about varied embod ied experiences. Moving away from discus sions of normative bodies, archaeologists have begun to include consideration of sensory ex periences once considered impossible to de tect archaeologically. Experiencing the Archaeological Body Kus (1992) issued an early call for the neces sity of including sensory experience as part of any archaeology of embodiment. Building on her ethnographic experiences, she argued that archaeological interpretations that did not di rectly address the senses would miss signifi cant aspects of human experience in the past, experiences that motivated people to act in particular ways. Archaeological research on sensory expe rience since then has taken varied forms. Drawing on European texts recording Cen tral Mexican concepts in the sixteenth century, L pez Austin (1988), Ortiz de Montellano (1989), and F rst (1995) detailed indigenous models of physiology and embod iment. Houston &amp; Taube (2000) presented an overview of epigraphic and iconographie evi dence for sensory perception among the Clas sic Maya nobility, and Houston (2001) drew on human representation to propose codes of decorum typical of the same group. Sweely (1998) considered in detail the possible im plications for intervisibility, and thus differ ential knowledge, of persons who might have been at work in one sector of ancient Ceren, El Salvador, a site whose burial by volcanic eruption allows a finer-grained modeling of everyday interaction than is ordinarily possi ble in archaeology. Dornan (2004) draws on neuro-phenomenology to propose interpre tations of individual religious experience in Classic Maya society. Models of embodied experience have sometimes relied on assuming universals, and here archaeological research has been criti cal in reinforcing the historicity of specific perceptual, sensory, and experiential regimes (Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003). Constructing cred ible models of past experiences of embod iment becomes more difficult once univer sality is questioned because the archaeologist cannot begin by assuming the position of a typical person. Where iconographie or lit erary sources are available, as for the clas sical Mediterranean, Classic Maya, ancient Egyptians, and many of the societies studied by historic archaeologists, approaches to such models have been productive, although not without points of disagreement (Houston &amp; Taube 2000, Meskell 2000a, Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003). Representational media, whether texts or images, bring with them an additional set of interpretive challenges. They must be viewed not simply as reflections of existing concepts of embodiment, but as part of the mate rial apparatus through which such concepts were naturalized. Analysis of less discur sive archaeological materials, even in situa tions where extensive textual or iconographie sources are available, provides a valuable way to tack from acknowledged bodily ideals to bodily experiences that sometimes were in www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body 147</page><page sequence="10">conflict with expressed ideals. For example, examining medieval British society, Gilchrist (1999, pp. 109^45) adopts a phenomenolog ical perspective, considering the spatial or ganization of castles and the experiences of persons in them as the bases for understand ing gendered experiences of embodiment. Morris &amp; Peatfield (2002) use representations of bodily gestures inscribed in figurines recov ered from hilltop sanctuaries in Crete to ex plore the "feeling body" experiencing ritual, entering into altered states of conscious ness. Explicitly grounded in comparison with ethnographic research, particularly on shamanic experiences using controlled pos ture to induce trance states, their argument essentially assumes that the figurines they study iconically represent actual postures as sumed by ritual participants at the sanctu ary sites (compare T te 1996). Tarlow (2002, p. 87) explores how the physicality of the body in nineteenth century England was experi enced by those who survived the deceased per son, simultaneously illuminating the sensory affect of the dead body for the living (com pare Kus 1992) and the existence of a philoso phy of incorruptibility of the body that shaped the lives of survivors and their now-deceased loved one. For archaeologists working in areas lack ing documentary sources, phenomenological approaches may be one of the only ways to even begin to explore embodiment. In a series of publications juxtaposing excavated contexts in Neolithic Britain and Europe, in which disarticulated human remains were deposited, with analyses of formal constructed spaces in which human body parts were sometimes de picted in visual images, a number of archae ologists have suggested lines of approach to both an experiencing body and the body as experienced by others (Fowler 2002; Richards 1993; Thomas 1993, 2000, 2002; Thomas &amp; Tilley 1993). Emphasizing the fragmentation of the remains of human bodies across dif ferent contexts, these researchers have argued vigorously for an experience of embodiment that was partible and collective. Thus, in sites in Brittany "the physical body... has gone from a living whole of flesh and bone, to a chaotic mass of bone and sinew, partly articu lated, to a rearranged whole as stacks of ribs. The new figure... is the social whole, the body of the social collectivity, into which individual egos have merged.. .one can be part of soci ety or one can die alone_One can imagine that as well as the artwork, the message was conveyed through the use of actual human re mains" (Thomas &amp; Tilley 1993, pp. 269-70). In a particularly striking study of material from Neolithic Scotland, MacGregor (1999) challenges the visual bias of much archaeo logical analysis and demonstrates how objects that in no way can be directly linked to bod ies (either as body parts or representations) may provide a basis to conceptualize em bodiment. He considers in detail the sensory experience of decorated stone balls, which oc cupants of these sites may have enjoyed, as an alternative to functionalist explanations of the production and use of these objects, explicitly relating these bodily experiences to the cre ation and re-creation of social identities. He argues that most archaeological analysis priv ileges visual experience over the use of other senses (compare Hamilakis 2002). Instead, he emphasizes the tactile qualities of the artifacts he is examining (compare Ouzman 2001). MacGregor advocates that archaeologists em ploy "haptic analysis" in addition to the more common visual analyses of material culture to remain attentive to the likelihood that other cultures in the past elaborated distinctive sen sory regimes. As Csordas (1994, p. 61) notes, "work on haptic touch is useful in develop ing a sense of the agency of the body in both individual and social existence, and may thus contribute to the elaboration of the model of embodied feeling." Other routes for archaeological under standing of embodied experience come from the application of biological techniques to reconstruct health, work patterns, and body modifications throughout the life course (Boyd 1996, Cohen &amp; Bennett 1993, Cox &amp; Sealy 1997). Differential access to dietary 148 Joyce</page><page sequence="11">resources can provide information about status identities reflected in living bodies as differences in stature and body size. Re construction of repetitive activity constitutes evidence of habitual adoption of postures, sometimes specific to gender or other iden tities. Far more than skin deep, the biologi cal experiences of people in the past, similar to their experiences of identity and person hood, defy any attempt to separate surface and interior. Is "Surface" to "Interior" As "Public" is to "Private"? Following Grosz (1995), Gilchrist (2000, p. 91) argues for "a more materialist consider ation of the body, one which would examine how the processes of social inscription on the exterior surface coalesce to construct a psychi cal interior" through "the inclusion of the di mensions of time and space." Peterson (2000) exemplifies the work of bioarchaeologists whose studies of human skeletal remains chal lenge the dichotomy of surface and interior in precisely the way predicated by social analyses such as those by Grosz (1994, 1995). Bioar chaeologists trace the evidence in the more durable parts of the human body of habitual patterns of movement and action and of dif ferential life experiences (Agarwal et al. 2004, Becker 2000, Boyd 2002, Cohen &amp; Bennett 1993, Robb 2002). In traditional physical an thropology, such traces of individual embod ied experience were abstracted to character ize categories of people (sexes, races, or age groups, for example). Today, the same obser vations are open to more idiographic inter pretation as evidence of diverse experiences of embodied persons (Robb 2002). Particu larly interesting from such an osteobiograph ical perspective are studies of the dramatic manipulation of the living body, reflected in skeletal remains as well as in artistic canons. In many times and places, human populations have shaped the still malleable head of infants and young children (Boyd 2002, pp. 145^46; Joyce 2001a,c). Dentition is another bodily site where traces of practices during life are preserved. Extraction of teeth, filing, inset ting materials, and supplementing teeth with dental "appliances" are specific practices that have begun to be viewed as evidence of bod ily experience and the cultural shaping of em bodied personhood (Becker 2000; Boyd 2002, pp. 145-46; Joyce 2001c; Robb 1997, 2002). Just as bioarchaeological studies of bod ily interiority yield understandings of embod ied experience and public appearance, so also do reexaminations of costume and represen tation challenge the equation of the body with a public surface. Rissman (1988), in a contex tual analysis comparing the contents of buried hoards to human interments in the Harappan civilization, argued that costume ornaments worn by the dead, traditionally viewed by ar chaeologists as evidence of the internalized, private, uncontestable "identity" of the per son, were viewed by a wider public during mortuary rituals as part of contestation of the status of dead persons and the groups to which they belonged. Sweely (1998), citing Joyce (1996), suggests that experiences of the in habitants of ancient Ceren in more and less intimate spatial settings served to naturalize their sense of their own position and rela tions to others as they grew from childhood to adulthood. Gilchrist (2000, p. 91) proposed to examine the "interior, experiential qualities of sexuality, as it was expressed through the ma teriality of space and visual imagery" among celibate medieval women (see also Gilchrist 1994). In these and similar studies, the bound aries of "the body" and of the spatial context "around" it are shown to be inextricably re lated (Potter 2004). The products of such new approaches in archaeology are no longer categorical expres sions of preexisting identities. Instead, con temporary archaeology of the body, moving beyond the dichotomy of surface and interior, considers the ways that body practices and representations of bodies worked together to produce experiences of embodied personhood differentiated along lines of sex, age, power, etc. www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body 149</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGIES OF EMBODIED PERSONHOOD Meskell (1996), noting that "the body" dis cussed in then-current archaeological writing was almost always the female body, urged ex plicit archaeological attention to masculinity, a theme addressed most directly by Knapp (1998). Scott (1997, p. 8) noted the irony that critiques of the common archaeological use of a masculine subject position had done little to explicitly theorize masculinity itself, instead focusing on delineating feminine experience. Although she suggested that "preoccupation with the body as a defining force is a peculiarly late modern social development" (p. 8), and argued from ancient Roman and Greek data that masculinity in the past was "not in fact measured by levels of direct sexual activity or paternity.. .nor bodily prowess, nor dress" (p. 9), a number of archaeological analyses have productively traced discourses through which embodied masculinities were shaped. Gilchrist (1997, pp. 47-50) is among the archaeologists who have, in different ways, underscored the production of masculinities expressed as differential strength as often a difference among male subjects as between male and female. Relating a suite of objects placed in burials of males in Bronze Age Europe to cultivation of the body and par ticipation in warfare, Treherne (1995) pro posed that an exemplary warrior masculin ity was a product of circumstances of this time and place. Yates (1993, pp. 35-36, 41 48), in his analysis of human images in Scan dinavian rock art, identified representational schema depicting distinct masculinities, con trasting in their degree of phallicism and ag gression, with prominent calf muscles act ing as a marker of a particular kind of male body. Winter (1989) pursued an analysis of the way that the able body in texts describing a Mesopotamian ruler was referenced through visual emphasis on musculature in portraits of the seated ruler. She further proposed that the body of another ruler was sexualized for the visual consumption of viewers as a production of a kind of hyperbolic masculinity (Winter 1996). Analyses of Classic Maya images in which young men's active, vigorous bodies are presented as objects for the admiring gaze of older males and women alike offer an analysis of these images simultaneously as precedents for the embodied performances of cohorts of young men and as inscriptions of an idealized young male body (Joyce 2000b, 2002b). Broadening the scope of embodied per sonhood beyond the feminized body has also involved radically questioning the indivisi bility of embodied persons. Thomas (2002) suggests that the archaeology of Neolithic Britain can best be understood as evidence of a form of personhood distinct from contem porary Western individuality. His argument, based on careful examination of contexts in which human skeletal elements and artifacts were split and rearranged, is that in Neolithic Britain the embodied person may not have been bounded by the skin, but extended sub stantively by objects of various kinds (Thomas 2002, p. 41). "Both artefacts and bodies were governed by the principles of partibility and circulation. Both formed elements in a more general economy of substances' which in volved other materials. Both artefacts and bodies could be broken down into parts, and artefacts at least were made by putting differ ent substances together" (Thomas 2002, p. 42; compare Fowler 2002). Understandings of personhood as partible and dividual have been employed by other archaeologists in analyses of the extension of material culture of the body in a number of ancient societies (Fowler 2003, Looper 2003a, Meskell &amp; Joyce 2003). To un derstand the body in the past, archaeologists are increasingly engaging broader theories of embodiment and materiality. THEORIZING THE BODY IN ARCHAEOLOGY A central assumption, often left inexplicit in archaeological work on embodiment, is that social understandings were "created, ordered, and perpetuated in respect to associations ISO Joyce</page><page sequence="13">with material culture" (Lesick 1997, p. 38). These associations shape experience through out childhood, contributing to the production of adult social positions (Joyce 2000a). Sofaer Derevenski (1997, pp. 196-97) argues that "the developing child imports, transfers, and ascribes gendered meanings to objects and actively transforms them into the gendered world in which s/he lives." Although her anal ysis is based on studies of Western childhood, she assumes that children in other societies, with other gender constructs, would nonethe less have passed through similar stages of development, albeit processing distinct cul tural content. Archaeologists sharing such understandings call for analysis of "material culture which workfs] to structure cultural ex perience" (Lesick 1997, p. 38). Archaeolog ical explorations of embodiment, distinct as they may be in other respects, share an un derstanding of the material environment that archaeology delineates as shaping past experi ence, and consequently, as potentially a point of connection with such past experiences. Meskell (2000b) has argued that archaeo logical writing on the body needs to be more rigorously theorized. She describes archae ology of the body as proceeding from two theoretical positions. In the first position she identifies the body as "the scene of display," a perspective she traces to reliance on the work of Foucault (see also Meskell 1998b). Meskell sees this line of work as primarily concerned with "posture, gesture, costume, sexuality, and representation" (p. 15). The second project, which she calls "the body as artifact," she as sociates with Anthony Giddens' structuration theory. She sees "the body as artifact" as con cerned with "sets of bodies" as "normative representatives of larger social entities fulfill ing their negotiated roles, circumscribed by powerful social forces," passive bodies "de scribed in relationship to [the] landscape or as spatially experiencing the phenomenon of monuments" (p. 16). She was strongly criti cal of both archaeological approaches, seeing them, as practiced to that date, as lacking con cern with the body as a site of lived experience. Related arguments have become more common since Meskell formulated her discus sion, which although published in 2000 com ments on a conference held in 1996. Boyd (2002, p. 137) criticizes archaeologists work ing on sites in the Levant for a lack of attention to "the social body and embodied agency," noting that, as is generally the case in archae ology, the body is mainly approached as "an objectified entity in physical/biological an thropological studies" or, as the dead body of mortuary studies, as an index of social organi zation, or as a focus of symbolism. His com ments characterize much contemporary ar chaeological practice. To move forward, Boyd (2002, p. 138) proposes a shift to examine together "food consumption, treatment of the dead body, treatment of the living body and body representation." Hamilakis and col leagues (2002, p. 13) propose that such dis tinct strands of archaeological research on the body may begin to be integrated in an emerging emphasis on what they call "the ex periencing body," "in which critically-aware sensory and phenomenological archaeologies may be used to enrich existing traditions such as physical anthropology, gender studies, and mortuary archaeology." They include in their appraisal such developments as archaeological attention to the incorporation into the body of food and drugs (Boyd 2002, Hamilakis 1999, 2002, Wilkie 2000) and concern with material technologies as shaping the body [in the man ner captured by Mauss's (1992) elucidation of "techniques of the body"] and as bodily exten sions, or what Hayles (1999) calls prostheses. An archaeology of the body as site of lived experience as the site of "the articulation of agency and structure, causality and mean ing, rationality and imagination, physical de terminations and symbolic resonances" is a project Meskell (2000b, p. 18) aligns with the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and with feminist theory. Meskell is careful to separate her call for attention to lived experience from an equation of an archaeology of the body with the reconstruction of biography of named, historical individuals, something that is www.annualreviews.org Archaeology of the Body i$i</page><page sequence="14">possible where archaeological data are suffi ciently rich and particularistic (Meskell 1998a, 1999, 2000a). Instead her proposal, illus trated by her own work on Egyptian per sonhood drawing on a range of data from burials, houses, and documentary sources, is that archaeologists take up the challenge of "a search for the construction of identity or self (Meskell 2000b, p. 20) that would include but not be restricted to embodiment. There are points of intersection between studies of embodiment and subjectivity in the social sciences at large and archaeology in particular (Joyce 2004). Grosz (1995, p. 33) discerns two lines of discussion of the body in contemporary social theory, one "inscrip tive" and one dealing with the phenomeno logical "lived body": "[T]he first conceives the body as a surface on which social law, moral ity, and values are inscribed, the second refers largely to the lived experience of the body, the body's internal or psychic inscription. Where the first analyzes a social, public body, the second takes the body-schema or imaginary anatomy as its object(s)." Most archaeology, until recently, has treated the body solely as inscriptive. Archaeology developed from the Western tradition that separated mind, the nonmate rial site of identity, from body and tradition ally understood itself to be limited to address ing the body as a public site or object of social action (Grosz 1994, pp. 3-10; Knapp &amp; Meskell 1997, pp. 183-87; Meskell 1996, 1998b, 2000b, 2001; Turner 1984, pp. 30-59). Phenomenological approaches adopted by ar chaeologists offer instead a perspective on the body as "the instrument by which all infor mation and knowledge is received and mean ing is generated" (Grosz 1994, p. 87, com menting on Merleau-Ponty 1962). Csordas (1994, pp. 10-11) suggests that contemporary approaches to embodiment rooted in phe nomenology require an emphasis on "lived ex perience." He sees this shift from analysis of an objectified "body" to understanding of ac tive "embodiment" as involving replacement of semiotic approaches with hermeneutic in terpretive perspectives. Under the influence of phenomenological approaches, in the con temporary archaeology of embodiment, the semiotic perspective of the information trans mission and identity signaling models and the description of inert (often literally dead) bodies are being replaced by analysis of the production and experience of lived bodies, in which surface and interior are no longer separated.
