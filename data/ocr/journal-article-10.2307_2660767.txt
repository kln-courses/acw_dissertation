<plain_text><page sequence="1">AGENCY, PERSONHOOD AND THE 'I' OF DISCOURSE IN THE PACIFIC AND BEYOND ALAN RUMSEY Australian National University Sahlins bases his account of Polynesian 'heroic history' partly on the fact that chiefs used the pronoun 'I' in reference to their whole group. Mosko (1992) argues that Sahlins's consequent emphasis on 'encompassment' as the modality of chiefly action is diametrically opposed to Strathern's on 'partibility', the effacement of parts of the person as a condition of action. Drawing on comparative material from the New Guinea Highlands, where big men also use 'I' for their whole group, and on Benveniste's and Urban's accounts of the meaning and use of personal pronouns, I argue instead that moments of both encompassment and partibility are inherent in language, corresponding to two distinct dimensions in which the pronouns are meaningful (the 'direct indexical' and the 'anaphoric'), and that close attention to the interaction between the two can yield new insights into the nature of personhood and social agency. Though anthropology has left behind the bad old days, when 'the person' was admitted as subject matter only in the form of an abstract configuration of social roles, we still suffer from a tendency to separate concrete human action in the here and now from questions of 'personhood' as a cultural category. I will try to help bridge that gap by focusing closely on one of the things that people do with language, namely posit themselves as agents with the first person pronoun I (and related forms). My ethnographic focus is upon the Pacific. This is an especially fertile field for such a venture because the region has seen some of anthropology's most challenging work in the cross-cultural study of personhood (e.g., Leenhardt 1979 [1947]; Lutz 1988; Read 1955), and also because it is one in which specific patterns of pronoun use have already been drawn upon as evidence for one of the most prominent theoretical accounts of social actorhood, in Sahlins's recent work on Polynesian 'heroic history'. In this article I will be discussing Sahlins's model in relation to what is currently one of the most prominent anthropological accounts of person- hood, a Melanesianist one by Marilyn Strathern. I will attempt to resolve some apparent contradictions between the two models by introducing Melanesian evidence concerning pronominal usage and reconsidering Polynesian usage in light of it. My conclusions and the forms of analysis I introduce along the way will, I hope, provide a new and useful perspective on questions of personhood and social action in general.

(N.S.) 6, 101-115</page><page sequence="2">102 ALAN RUMSEY Of chiefs, big men, detachability and encompassment Strathern develops her model of the partible person as a self-conscious displacement of Western notions of the individual and society. From within the terms of that presumed Western orthodoxy (1988: 12), she draws out an image of the Melanesian person as relationally constituted: a composite of detachable parts identified with the separate male and female contributions which have produced it. Although Strathern intends The gender of the gft as a 'cultural description' (1988: 244) rather than a 'sociological analysis' (Strathern 1992: 150), it engages centrally with questions of social action and agency. While the person in this view is composite, the act is unitary' (1988: 274), and is prermissed upon the externalization or 'eclipse' of parts of the person who acts. So, for example, a woman in giving birth to a child eclipses the composite male and female origins of her own body and evinces her own agency as a kind of 'constitu- tive singleness' (1988: 278). An agent in this view is 'one who from his or her own vantage point acts with another's in mind' (1988: 272). So, when a man makes a prestation to his exchange partner, the partner is the cause. In this view agents 'are not the authors of their own acts. They simply do them. Agency and cause are split' (1988: 273). A very different account of a form of personal agency has come out of Sahlins's model of 'heroic history'. Drawing upon Hawaiian, Fijian and Tongan ethnography and upon Dumont's (1970) understanding of hierarchy as encompassment, Sahlins argues that chiefs acted expansively, summing up in their own person the lives of many. Although Sahlins develops his account of heroic history from Polynesian and Fijian material, he suggests that it is (or was) much more widespread, as we shall see below. Not surprisingly, some ethnographers working in those areas of Melanesia where there are forms of hereditary succession have pondered the possible utility of Sahlins's model (e.g. Lindstrom 1981; Mosko 1992;Young 1994), and at least one (Lutkehaus 1990) has found it highly apposite. Even leaving aside questions of intra- and inter-regional variation, Sahlins's and Strathern's accounts are not commensurate, since the former concerns chiefs in particular while the latter concerns personhood in general. Nonethe- less, as Mosko (1992) has appreciated, Strathern's account, precisely because of its purported generality, does present a challenge for Sahlins's: not all persons are chiefs, but all chiefs are, presumably, persons. So, insofar as Melanesian figures such as the Manam tanepoa 'chiefly elite' (Lutkehaus 1990: 183), North Mekeo 'hereditary officials' (Mosko 1992; cf. Mosko 1985; 1994) or Kanak daame 'chief' (Douglas 1994) approximate Sahlins's Polynesian prototype, they come within the potential ambit of both his model and Strathern's. Is one of them thereby falsified? Mosko has treated the two views as mutually exclusive, and drawn upon his own ethnography of North Mekeo as a test case for comparing them. The Mekeo people live in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea in one of the regions whose traditional styles of political leadership have been construed as interstitial between the 'big man' (cum 'great man') systems of New Guinea and Polynesian style chieftainships. In Mosko's account, Mekeo personhood not only conforms to Strathern's model of the partible person, but raises it to</page><page sequence="3">ALAN RUMSEY 103 a higher power, since both the male and female contributions to both parents of a Mekeo person are acknowledged, yielding 'quadripartite structures' in place of Strathern's foundational opposition between cross-sex and same sex relations. But this compounding effect does not extend over more than two generations, since, in Mosko's account, marital and mortuary exchanges rid Mekeo persons of the blood of two of their four grandparents, rendering bride and groom complementary in what kinds of clan blood they do and do not have. For hereditary chiefs and sorcerers there is a second stage to this 'decon- ception', valorized by an important Mekeo myth, wherein they symbolically divest themselves of their mother's blood, allowing them to 'affect purely masculine identities' as opposed to the 'androgynous' ones of commoner men and women (Mosko 1992: 709). In line with Strathern's model of the partible person, Mosko (1992: 705-6) avers: 'Only in a condition of relative incompleteness . . . are [Mekeo] married adults considered to be capable of significant action, that is, of effectively par- ticipating in the reciprocities of and discourses comprising most village life. Relatively complete persons, such as infants, children and unmarried youths, are to that degree socially ineffective'. It is their deconception that renders them socially effective. The fact that chiefs and sorcerers undergo a second stage of it is, for Mosko, afortiori evidence of this, as it is 'in their additional deconception to a strictly male identity that Mekeo chiefly figures establish, as in Sahlins's view of divine kings, their "heroic" or "divine" credentials and capacities vis-a-vis ordinary villagers' (1992: 706). Having argued that Strathernian partibility provides a better understanding of Mekeo and other Melanesian forms of chieftainship than does Dumontian encompassment, Mosko suggests that the same may be true of Polynesian chieftainship, citing as evidence Sahlins's own earlier emphasis on 'redivision' and 'redistribution' of wealth as the epitome of chiefly powers, and Sahlins's andValeri's more recent emphasis on sacrifice as the basis of the chief's divin- ity (Mosko 1992: 712-13). Pronouns, persons and heroic history While Mosko's comparison is interesting and valuable for the way it brings a new theoretical perspective to bear on an old problem,2 and for the way it extends the potential scope of Strathern's model, the confrontation he tries to set up between that model and Sahlins's is less direct than Mosko imagines. This is because the evidence on which Sahlins largely bases his model of heroic history is of a different sort from that on which Strathern bases the partible person. What is central in Sahlins's accounts, but not in Strathern's or Mosko's, is a particular form of pronoun reference, namely the use by chiefs of the first person singular 'I' to refer at once to themselves and to the social collectivity (tribe, ramage, etc.) with which they are identified. As an empirical datum, this usage is something Sahlins noted in his earliest ethnography (Sahlins 1962: 254). It first took on great theoretical significance in Historical netaphors and nythic realities, where, in support of his claim that 'Polynesian cosmology may lend itself in an especially powerful way to</page><page sequence="4">104 ALAN RUMSEY stereotypic reproduction', Sahlins cites the fact that he has 'heard a Fijian elder narrate the doings of his ancestral lineage over several generations in the first person pronoun' (Sahlins 1981: 13). Similar usages among the Maori had been noticed and discussed by J. Prytz Johansen under the rubric of 'the kinship "I"'. For example, Johansen cites a Maori oral account (and Sahlins cites Johansen) as follows: Example 1: According to our knowledge the reason why the Ngatiwhatuwa came to Kaipara was a murder committed by the Ngatikahumateika. This tribe murdered my ancestor Taureka. The tribe lived in Hokianga. This country was theirs, the tribe's. My home was Muriwhenua, it was my permanent residence because my ancestor lived there. Later I left Muriwhenua because of this murder. Then I tried to revenge myself, and Hokianga's people were defeated and I took possession of the old country. Because of this battle the whole of Hokianga was finally taken by me right to Maunganui, and I lived in the country because all the people had been killed. All the events described[, Johansen comments,] took place long before the narrator was born Johansen 1954: 36, cited in Sahlins 1981: 13-14). By 1985 Sahlins had worked up his interpretation of such examples into the concept of 'Heroic History'. Drawing again upon Johansen he says that ethnography shows that the Maori chief'lives the life of a whole tribe', that 'he stands in a certain relation to neighbouring tribes and kinship groups' and that 'he gathers the rela- tionship to other tribes in his person' Johansen 1954: 180).The chief's marriages are inter- tribal alliances; his ceremonial exchanges trade; injuries to himself are cause for war. Here history is anthropomorphic in principle, which is to say in structure. Granted that history is much more than the doings of great men, is always and everywhere the life of commu- nities; but precisely in these heroic polities the king is the condition of possibility of the community (Sahlins 1985: 35-6). Now Johansen's 'kinship I' becomes Sahlins 'heroic I'. Sahlins cites other examples from Tonga and as far afield as Luapula, Northern Rhodesia. He concludes that by the use of this 'heroic I - and various complements such as perpetual kinship - the main relationships of society are at once projected historically and embodied currently in the persons of authority' (Sahlins 1985: 47). He comments that this 'heroic I' is 'found in Maori, Tonga, Fiji, among Yoruba as well as Luapala, and probably numerous other hierarchical orders' (1985: 47 n. 19). In a later publication Sahlins adduces a Fijian example from the transcript of a government hearing on fishing rights in 1947. The disputants are 'the sacred ruler of Verata (Na Ratu)' and a spokesman (mata) from Bau 'repre- senting the war king (Vunivalu)': Example 2: The Ratu of Verata (responding to question by the Bau representative [mata]): I never heard of our meeting at Naivonini in 1750.... I don't know any Tunitoga [Bau herald] named Sainisakalo that you say I killed at the beach at Walu [late 1830s] . .. I don't know when you burned Natavatolo [this was 1839 ... I know of no such set of 10 whale teeth that you say were offered on my behalf by Nagalu to Ratu Cakobau and Ratu Mara [probably in the 1850s]. I only know we are true kinsmen, myself and both these chiefs [Cakobau and Ratu Mara] (VQ 1947: 243-4, as quoted with parenthetical remarks by Sahlins, in Sahlins 1991: 65). The Bau mata (responding to questions of the Verata ruler): From long ago until 1750 you were the owner of all the reefs we are disputing here, but I seized them from you</page><page sequence="5">ALAN RUMSEY 105 in 1750 when I defeated you in our war at Naivonini.... I know that I destroyed you [lit- erally,'clubbed you', mokuti iko] the third time I took your town.... I never heard that you were able to take or destroy a single land in all of Fiji. You never captured a single place in Fiji because of your weakness: the reason you never made war on another state is not [as you say] because you are the first born [i.e., the senior line of Fijian ruling aristocracies ... ] (VQ 1947: 284-8, as quoted with parenthetical remarks by Sahlins, in Sahlins 1991: 65). What are we to make of such examples in relation to the question of 'encompassment' vs. 'partibility' as the basis of chiefly power? In order to address that question I first turn to some general considerations regarding the meaning and use of pronouns. Aspects of pronominal reference3 First- and second-person pronouns are inherently indexical, shifting in ref- erence according the context in which they occur: 'I' can only be specified as 'the person who is uttering the present instance of discourse containing I', and 'you' as the person 'spoken to in the present instance of discourse con- taining the linguistic instance you' (Benveniste 1966: 252-3, my translation). Third-person pronouns, 'he', 'she', 'it', etc., are also indexical, but not of the person speaking or spoken to. Rather, in their prototypical uses they link to other 'antecedent' referring expressions elsewhere in the immediate context of discourse: 'This old man, he played one', etc. The latter kind of indexical relation, between a pronoun and its antecedent, is generally known in the linguistic literature as anaphoric, while the former, more direct relation between a pronoun and a person or entity in the speech situation, has been called a 'direct indexical' relation (Urban 1989). The distinction between 'direct indexical' and 'anaphoric' is not a matter of 'either-or', with first- and second-person pronouns on one side of it and third- person ones on the other. This is because the referent of 'I' is not always the present speaker, but can be someone whose identity is established somewhere else in the discourse. A prime example would be the use of 'I' in quoted speech: "'I see" said the blind man', where the referent of 'I' is the person identified as its speaker in the fragment, 'the blind man'. In other words, the reference of the first person pronoun is here established anaphorically, no less than in the third-person example above ('This old man, he played one'). But this is not to say that 'I' loses all traces of its direct-indexicality in such contexts. In quoting another speaker, the speaker of the quote to some extent assumes the persona of the person being quoted (e.g. 'the blind man' in my example above), inviting her interlocutors to regard the quoted speaker from his point of view, as if he were a kind of 'I' (Clark &amp; Gerrig 1990; Urban 1989: 35). This is what Urban, in his seminal paper by the same name, calls the 'I of discourse'. Besides direct quotation, Urban explores a range of other uses of'discourse I' which he distinguishes as: (1) 'de-quotative I', as used, for example in styles of vivid story-telling, where the identity of one or more protagonists has been established in the narrative, but there is no explicit marking of a given stretch of quotation as there was in the example above; (2) 'theatrical I', where there is a more thorough-going assumption of the protagonists' personae by the</page><page sequence="6">106 ALAN RUMSEY speaking actors; (3) projective 'I', as used in trance states, and so forth (Urban 1989: 43). Urban's framework is useful in permitting us to take account of the interaction between the anaphoric and direct-indexical dimensions of dis- course in the constitution of speakership and social identity. To see what I mean, let us return to example 14 from Sahlins (1981). The speaker's first reference to himself is with the first-person singular possessive pronoun 'my', in the second sentence. This cannot be taken as an instance of the heroic first-person singular, because in heroic usage the speaking chief would not be distinct from his ancestor Taureka, but would speak as that ancestor: 'I Taureka' or some such. Rather, it serves to create an anaphoric link by which we and his audience know to interpret his next use of 'my' (three sentences later) as a 'heroic' one in which he is identifying himself totally with his ancestor: 'My [= Taureka's] home was Muriwhenua, it was my [= Taureka's] permanent home'. This short sequence already shows how complicated a phenomenon is the 'I of discourse'. Both occurrences of the pronoun 'my' directly index the speaker, but at two different levels of inclusiveness, the first at a lower one where he distinguishes himself from his ancestor Taureka and the second at a higher one where he is Taureka. In other words, the social identity indexed by 'I' (or 'my') is capable of changing in scope according to its anaphoric context. For further illustration of this, let us consider the rest of example 1. The narrator says of the place Muriwhenua, 'it was my permanent residence because my ancestor lived there'. His 'my' here is seemingly more ambiguous than the ones above. If by 'my ancestor' he means Taureka, then we must con- clude that the scope of 'my' has contracted to the one it had in the second sentence above, where the narrator was distinguishing himself from his ances- tor in order to establish the link with him. Alternatively, if the possessor referred to by 'my' is Taureka, then the narrator, in identifying with him, would presumably be referring to an even more distant ancestor of his own, to whom he is linked through Taureka. In the rest of the text all the remaining instances of 'I' and 'my' clearly refer to Taureka, and presumably his entire 'tribe' as personified by the narrator. Now consider example 2. This is especially valuable because it shows the 'heroic' pronouns being used in dialogue. While it is clear that the interlocu- tors are using these pronouns to speak as ancestral powers and hence as social collectivities, it is equally clear that they disagree about the precise historical identity of those powers and collectivities. And one of the ways they contest these is through the anaphoric relations in which they place the pronouns 'I' and 'you'. Consider, for example, the first sentence of the second paragraph, where the Bau mata says to the Ratu of Verata: 'From long ago until 1750 you were the owner of all the reefs we are disputing here, but I seized them from you in 1750 when I defeated you in our war at Naivonini'. The refer- ent of the 'I' here obviously cannot be identified as the Bau mata or solely as the contemporary Bau 'war king' for whom he is a spokesman, since the events occurred long before they were born. But how do we or his audience know what larger social identity is being invoked? We know partly through the relationship between the 'I' and its anaphoric context of discourse.</page><page sequence="7">ALAN RUMSEY 107 Here this works contrastively, through the reciprocal dyad of 'I' and 'you'. If 'you' were the owner of the reefs in question before 1750, then 'I' is to be construed as a social identity of the same order who was the owner of the reefs after 1750.5 From these examples of pronoun usage, it should be clear that we cannot presume a constant reality called 'the self' which, everywhere it exists, is directly expressed by the pronoun 'I'. Rather than indexing a constant self, what each situated use of this pronoun does is to index its speaker in such a way as to entail6 what Erving Goffman (1981) called a 'footing' from which she speaks: in Goffman's terms her current 'alignment','set', or'projected self'. Whatever we mean by the notion of 'self', it is not at all equivalent to 'footing' (or to Goffman's 'projected self'), for each self can assume a range of foot- ings. Footings are emergent positions within what Silverstein (1998) calls the 'interactional text' of particular speech events, as opposed to the level of'deno- tational text' at which a particular propositional content is conveyed. They are culturally specific in that they presuppose a range of more-or-less standard role types, such as the Fijian ratu or mata in the examples above, but the foot- ings are established at the level of particular, more or less recognizable instances of those general types. As shown by both Urban's and Silverstein's analysis, and by the examples above, speech-act participants move in out of footings strategically through an interplay between the direct indexicality of words such as 'I' and 'you' and their anaphoric relations to other expressions in the surrounding context of discourse. Ku Waru 'segmentary person' I now turn to some oratorical uses of grammatical person categories from the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where they have been extensively studied by Merlan and myself (Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991; Rumsey 1986; 1989). Our findings are of especial interest for the confrontation Mosko tries to set up between Sahlins and Strathern, because for all that the usages we studied resemble Sahlins's 'heroic I', the Ku Waru area where we worked is in the heartland of Strathern's 'partible person', immediately adjacent to the Melpa area where she has worked. We found that it was common in the oratory used at inter-group events for the orators to use the first-person singular in reference to their entire tribe, even in reference to events in which they had not personally participated, just as in the Polynesian cases discussed above. Examples occur in the text frag- ment below, which comes from a speech given by a big man, Kujilyi, at an inter-group exchange where compensation is being presented in connection with an incident of warfare in which his group has been involved (for the full context, see Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991: 122-55; 245-321): pilyikimil el turum-uyl topa-kin epola-alya-sil lyirim-a you know that when there was fighting Epola-Alya [tribe-pair] took (sg.) it up pi tepa oba na-nga kangi-na nosinsirum then he came and put it on my skin jika-kungunuka sirid I gave it to Jika-Kungunuka [tribe pair] (Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991: 290).</page><page sequence="8">108 ALAN RUMSEY Here Kujilyi is talking not about the recent fighting from which the present transaction arises, but about a much earlier war that happened when he was a small boy. Nonetheless, in the last line he refers to his entire tribe, the Midipu (or possibly to Midipu together with its paired tribe Kusika), in the first- person singular, referring to the act of recruitment whereby his tribe-pair brought Jika-Kungunuka into the fighting. The orator also refers to his entire tribe or tribe-pair in the first person singular in the previous line, where 'put it on my skin' is used to mean 'make me liable for', Kujilyi's tribe having been recruited as allies.7 In Ku Waru it is not only in the first and second person that the singular number is used for entire social units, but in the third person as well. Third- person examples occur in the first two lines of the text above. In the first line, the expression epola-alya-sil 'the pair of Epola and Alya' occurs as the sin- gular subject of the verb lyi- 'take', describing the recruitment of those tribes into the war. In the second line, where this tribe pair is again the grammati- cal subject, all the verbs agreeing with it (te- 'do', o- 'come', nosi- 'put') are again explicitly marked for singular number (third person). A second-person example occurred in a speech by a Kopia orator at the same event. Referring to a recent battle in which no one from his tribe or the allied one had been killed, he said pe na yi-r naa turum, nu kepi te naa turum. This is very hard to translate, but says something like 'Not a single man of me was killed, and not one of thee was killed', where 'man' is treated not like a possession (which would be na-nga yi-r 'A single man of mine'), but like a part of the 'I', and of the singular interlocutor 'thou' (Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991: 276-7). While it is fairly clear in the examples above that the individual orators who are referred to cannot be identified as the sole referents of the 'I' or 'you', more commonly it is not clear whether the speaker is talking about himself or a whole segmentary unit. This can be illustrated from the follow- ing (for the full context, see Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991: 139-41; 271-1): poika kang nyikim, eee! laulku kang nyikim he says 'a Poika fellow' or 'a Laulku fellow' ilyi nyikin pel pora nyikim, poika kang-te el munsurum aki-yl what you (sg.) talking about, cousin, that's finished, a Poika was wounded olto-nga ung-iyl kornga pilyipa lyilym as for these words of us two he [the Poika] already understands about that el ya naa telybolu i kupulanum ilyi, ime-nga pansip tep, imenga pansip tep we two do not fight on this 'road' [i.e., within the Kopia-Kubuka-Poika-Palimni alliance]; we do it together all over the place na nanu poika-palirni-sil-kin molup telyo I myself stay with Poika and Palimi (Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991: 271) These lines come from a speech by a Kubuka man who is trying to justify not paying any compensation to Poika-Palimi people for the blood they have shed fighting alongside the Kopia-Kubuka, the idea being that it can be taken as a matter of course that Kopia-Kubuka and Poika-Palimi will fight together as allies rather than against each other, since they live together. When the Kubuka orator (Tamalu) says in the last line 'I myself stay with Poika and</page><page sequence="9">ALAN RUMSEY 109 Palimi', it is a moot point whether he is referring to himself alone, his entire tribe the Kubuka, or Kopia and Kubuka combined. For in his role as an oratory-wielding big man, he is projecting himself as a segmentary identity on the order of Kubuka or Kopia-Kubuka - personifying a social totality while amplifying his own person - so that precisely insofar as he stays with Poika and Palimi, Kopia and Kubuka stay with Poika and Palimi. Is Highland New Guinea to Polynesia as partibility is to encompassment? For purposes of comparison with the Polynesian cases discussed by Sahlins, and for assessing the compatibility of his model with Strathern's, the Ku Waru examples are apposite not only because they come from the ethnographic homeland of Strathern's 'partible person', but also because Ku Waru tribes are prime examples of her 'collective person '.8 The key issue here concerns the position of 'big men' and their role in the collective agency of the tribe or clan. As we show in Merlan and Rumsey (1991), at inter-group wealth exchanges, orating big men strive to coordinate a potential multiplicity of sub- sidiary interpersonal transactions among affines and matrilateral kinsmen into a single one among the larger segmentary units which they personify. Strath- ern describes what goes at these events in the following terms: The Hagen big man presents the entire clan as a homogeneous collectivity. He is its capacity for unity. At the same time, in so far as his single figure is created out of the diverse interests of his fellow clansmen, he turns these particular interests into collective ones. But he is not merely the conduit through which an internal relation is substituted for external ones (individual householders, embedded in their own matri- lateral affinal networks becoming a body of clansmen). I have suggested that the fact that collective unity is represented as the outcome of his single will or mind also enables the clan to then act as a particular and productive other in its external relations (Strathern 1991: 211). In sum, the Hagen big man, standing in a relation of equivalence to the body of male clans- men, enhances the possibility of the clan claiming a distinctive non-equivalence in relation to analogously composed bodies. For he is both more and less than the clan. The clan is enhanced in only one of its forms, as a singular rather than as a composite or heterogeneous body (Strathern 1991: 213). If the orating big man is both more and less than the clan, he is by the same token both more and less than the sum of his own everyday relational 'parts': less in that he must efface his cross-sex links to his own affines -and matri-kin in order to align himself with other men in his clan whose specific cross-sex links he does not share, but more because, in personifying his clan, he amplifies himself by representing its unity as the outcome of his single will (numan). In this sense, the most powerful and prototypical form of agency in the Western Highlands is not simply a matter of 'decomposition' or 'subtrac- tion' from the partible person, as Mosko argues for the north Mekeo, but also partakes of the 'expansive' mode which Sahlins attributes to Polynesia. The co-presence of these two contrary tendencies, the simultaneous amplification of the everyday self and partial eclipse of it, finds a parallel in some of Sahlins's own remarks about the Polynesian cases. For instance, he notes that 'in as much as the [Fijian] chief's being includes the whole, so</page><page sequence="10">110 ALAN RUMSEY reciprocally the other people participate in his person and thus retain the right, in proportion to their rank, to represent him' (Sahlins 1991: 67 emphasis added). This formulation resonates not only with Strathern's concept of per- sonal partibility, but also with the emphasis Mosko points out in Sahlins's earlier work upon division and redistribution as the modalities of chiefly power, and suggests that Sahlins has not really lost sight of them but has shifted his emphasis to the other side of what he still sees as a 'reciprocal' relation (cf. Mosko 1992: 712). In short, Strathern's Melanesianist model of agency and Sahlins's account of Polynesian chiefly forms of it are not essentially incompatible. Assuming the contrary, Mosko (1992: 713) suggests that Strathern's model should dis- place Sahlins's with respect to Polynesia, whereas I conclude that each may be of use in the other's ethnographic domain (the more so in areas such as Mekeo, which show features of both).9 Linguisitic dimensions of partibility and encompassment I now return to the distinction between the anaphoric and direct indexical dimensions of pronoun use, which is inherently related to the one between partibility and encompassment. To see how, let us first turn to some general considerations regarding personal pronouns. Consider the following quote from a classic paper by Benveniste (1971: 224-5): I use I only when I am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address. It is this condition of dialogue that is constitutive of person, for it implies that reciprocally I becomes you in the address of the one who in turn designates himself as L ... Language is possible only because each speaker sets himself up as a subject by referring to himself as I in his dis- course.... This polarity does not mean either equality or symmetry:'ego' always has a posi- tion of transcendence in relation to you. Nevertheless, neither of these terms can be conceived of without the other; they are complementary, although by an interior/exterior opposition, and, at the same time, they are reversible.... [This] condition of man in language is unique. This passage resonates with a wide range of relational views of person- hood, from G. H. Mead to Buber to Bakhtin to Lacan. What I wish to point out here is that, although Benveniste sees the 'I' as possible only in rela- tion to 'you', and the self as experienced only by contrast, he nonetheless accords the I a 'position of transcendence' with regard to you. This is not to say that the human subject is essentially transcendent or unitary or centred. Rather, what Benveniste is pointing to is a kind of momentary effect inherent in the nature of language, whereby the act of speaking establishes the current centre in relation to which the values of all the other deictic terms (here-there, this-that, now-then etc.) are fixed (Benveniste 1971: 226-7), and in relation to which subjectivity and performativity are possible (1971: 227-30; see also Austin 1962). These fundamental aspects of language are relevant to the question of encompassment. A central form of social action everywhere is, of course, speech. Insofar as every language has an 'I' (or equivalent first-person singu- lar grammatical category), it makes it possible for people to engage in that form of social action in such a way as to posit themselves as a unitary agent,</page><page sequence="11">ALAN RUMSEY 111 an agent of speaking. Notwithstanding all the Goffman-style shifts of 'footing' that may take place even over the course of a single stretch of speech by a single speaker, she does not generally assume more than one of them at once (Hanks 1990: 510; cf. Bakhtin 1986: 71 ff.). Even in the maximal case of 'transposition' (Buehler 1934; Hanks 1990: 217-23), whereby the speaker quotes the 'I' of another, the transposition is ultimately grounded in the current speech situation (Hanks 1990; cf. Clark &amp; Gerrig 1990; Rumsey 1990: 346-9). The moment of Benvenistean transcendence that is entailed in all these uses of 'I' provides, I suggest, a powerful model for the cultural con- struction of unitary action in general. In other words, where speech acts are concerned, Strathern's (1988: 274) dictum that 'Each act is "one" act' should not be taken as a specifically Melanesian principle, nor as a 'metaphysical' one (see footnote 1), but as inherent in the nature of language. It is that which provides the basis on which, for example, an orating big man or a Maori chief can present his entire clan or tribe as a homogeneous collectivity equivalent to himself. However, when we look at the use of personal pronouns in the anaphoric dimension of discourse, as opposed to the direct-indexical one, the figure pro- jected by the 'I' begins to look much more like Strathern's partible person. We have seen, for example, that even in the Fijian heartland of Sahlins's heroic history, the chief's 'I' can refer to himself as distinct from his ancestor, and immediately thereafter in a way that instantiates that ancestor. The Ku Waru orator can, within the space of a single sentence, speak as one man, and then as a body of men, which would still have survived as the 'one man' whom he was instantiating even if some of its component 'men' had been killed. Although these are particularly dramatic shifts of footing or 'projected self', they do not differ in kind from what happens regularly in discourse every- where (cf. Goffman 1981; Levinson 1988; Silverstein 1998). Here, then, is the most general lesson that can be drawn from the con- frontation that Mosko tries to set up between Sahlins's Polynesianist trope of encompassment and Strathern's Melanesianist one of partibility. It is not only that each can be applied within the other's region of ethnographic origin (as I have argued above), but that both correspond to fundamental aspects of what Benveniste (quoted above) called the 'condition of man in language'. Conclusion What remains of the empirical specificities that Sahlins tried to capture with his notion of heroic history and Strathern with her image of the partible person? Although it strains credibility to try to fit whole regions such as Melanesia and Polynesia neatly into these types,10 or even to see the types themselves as mutually exclusive (as I have tried to show above), the self- presentation of Maori or Fijian chiefs, and the social terrain they inhabited, were obviously very different from those of Western Highland big men. The concepts of partibility and encompassment do, I think, provide a useful point of departure for characterizing such differences. However, they can be made more useful by grounding them more firmly in the details of social interac- tion among the people whose lives we are trying understand. Strathern (1988;</page><page sequence="12">112 ALAN RUMSEY 1992: 150) rules this out by eschewing sociological analysis as a matter of principle, in favour of cultural description. Sahlins (1976) more ambitiously tries to transcend the antinomy between these two forms of analysis. As evi- dence for the notion of heroic history, he does focus on an aspect of social action, the ways that certain people posit themselves as agents. But he does so in too singular a way. By this I do not mean that Sahlins focuses too much on language or'mere' discursive agency, for I think it is of crucial importance. All social agency pre- sumes some aspects of social identity, even if contesting others, and none of this could conceivably happen in a world without language. Indeed, as the Ku Waru examples above suggest (and as Merlan and I have elsewhere shown in detail; Merlan &amp; Rumsey 1991; Rumsey 1986), a good deal of what goes on at the most salient inter-group political events among the Ku Waru people (who are undoubtedly not alone in this respect) is the reproduction of and disagreement about social agency through spe~ech. Here I do not refer just to linguistic agency: though the means are largely discursive, the acts at issue have included warfare, military and marital alliance, and inter-group wealth exchange. But the construction of these other kinds of agency has hinged crucially upon the construction of discursive agency, not just because people use language to talk about those other kinds of activity, but because they use it to talk as the relevant kinds of social agents. So, for example, the most important aspect of Tamalu's words 'I myself stay with Poika and Palimi' is not their semantic content, the proposition that Tamalu stays with Poika and Palimi, but the fact that his 'I' potentially encompasses the entire Kopia-Kubuka tribe pair, distinguishes it as a block from Poika-Palimi and Mujika-Laulku, and construes it as a unitary agent (not just in his present act of speaking, but in the act of warfare that has led up to it and the act of wealth exchange that is happening as he speaks). There is obviously in all this a thorough-going interplay between different kinds or dimensions of agency, in which the discursive plays a pivotal role. The problem with the concept of heroic history then, is not that it overplays the importance of speech or of pronouns. Rather, it is that it assumes too direct a link between facts of language structure and aspects of the social- cultural order. The link is a much more complex, mediated one, in at least two different respects. First, as shown by my analysis above, discourse unfolds in time, and as it does, language users, even heroic ones, establish shifting frames of reference, such that the 'IT of even a single speaker can index a wide range of social identities or footings in relation to a set of more-or-less fixed cultural schemata. In order to describe a given socio-cultural formation adequately, we need to be able to specify not only the macro-sociological roles that are invoked in all this, but the micro-level patterns by which people are able to align themselves with respect to those roles. The other relevant form of mediation between language structure and social process is one which I have not been able to address here, but which has been explored by linguistic anthropologists under the rubric of 'language ideo- logies' (see e.g. Rumsey 1990; Schieffelin et al. 1998; Silverstein 1979). This work attends to the fact that people do not just use language, they reflect</page><page sequence="13">ALAN RUMSEY 113 upon their uses of it, and in so doing refract aspects of language structure in specific ways. I suggested as much above, when I proposed that the gram- matical devices available in every language for the instantiation of discursive agency, namely first- and second-person pronouns and related person cate- gories, provide a model for other forms of personal agency (cf. Miihlhausler &amp; Harre 1990). Such models are more diverse than the linguistic categories they are based on because language structure is not transparent to human con- sciousness. It is therefore unwarranted to take facts about pronoun usage as direct evidence for cultural models of personhood or agency, heroic or other- wise. What one needs in order to get at those is an approach which is more attuned to indigenous forms of reflexivity, such as Strathern's is, but which includes language among the potential objects of that reflexivity, as in the recent literature on language ideology. By taking account of both these forms of mediation we can develop more precise and illuminating accounts of ethnographic cases such as the ones I have been discussing here. On both counts, the concepts of partibility and encompassment can be usefully operationalized by treating them, not as global features of societies or cultures, but as mutually presupposing dimensions of social interaction, along which locally specifiable forms of agency and iden- tity are created and contested. NOTES The argument of this paper has benefited greatly from comments received on earlier ver- sions presented at the 1996 annual nmeeting of the American Anthropological Association, and in 1998 seminars at Sydney University and Australian National University. For their helpful comments on earlier drafts, I also wish to thank Steve Feld, Don Gardner, Chris Gregory, Bill Hanks, Les Hiatt, Eric Hirsch, Margaret Jolly, Suzanne Kuehling, Jonathan Lamb, Shelley Mallet, Francesca Merlan, Mark Mosko, Michael O'Hanlon, Marshall Sahlins, Michael Silverstein, Andrew Strathern, Marilyn Strathern, Borut Talban, Greg Urban, Jimmy Weiner and Michael Young. "'Each act is "one" act. This ... perception is the single most significant metaphysical basis for the understanding of Melanesian relations' (Strathern 1988: 274). 2Some would say an obsolete problem: see Thomas (1989) for an argument that the Polynesia-Melanesia distinction is a chimerical one, based on an outmoded racial classification. While I would certainly agree with him that 'Melanesia' is not a unitary category in any inter- esting or significant respect, and that 'Polynesia' is a fuzzy one along the western edge, there are interesting problems of comparison across the larger continuum (or parts of it), as shown not only by Mosko's work, but by others such as Friedman (1981), Gell (1993) and Scaglion (1996). 3For a fuller discussion of theories of personal pronominal reference; see Muhlhausler and Harre (1990), Recanti (1993). For discussion of the relevance of the totalizing pronominal usage for such theories; see Rumseyl 1989). 4My analysis of this example, and the general approach taken below to the anaphoric dimen- sion of personal pronoun reference, have benefited greatly from comments by Bill Hanks (pers. comm. 1997) and Greg Urban (pers. comm. 1998) on an earlier version of this paper. 'I am indebted to Urban (pers. comm. 1998) for pointing out this example from the Sahlins quote in an earlier draft of this paper. 6For the relevant notion of pragmatic 'entailment', see Silverstein (1998: 270-1). 7Uses of 'I' in reference to the speaker's whole group, ancestor, or both, are also widely reported from other areas of Melanesia. For comparative references; see Merlan and Rumsey (1991).</page><page sequence="14">114 ALAN RUMSEY 8When Strathern says that the person is composite but the act is unitary and premissed upon the eclipsing of parts of the person (as discussed above), she means this to apply both at the level of what we Westerners would think of as 'individual' action and of 'collective' action (e.g. by clan or a ritual congregation), since the relevant collectivities are also composite persons (Strathern 1988: 14 et passim). So, for example,'a collectivity of men wishing to act to common purpose' contrive to appear as'one man', effacing their many cross-sex kin ties to others outside the collectivity (1988: 277; cf. 1991: 212-13). 9This conclusion converges interestingly with Hirsch's (1995). He argues for the comple- mentarity of Strathernian and Dumontian models with respect to aspects of the cosmology and social life of the Fuyuge of highland Papua.

Action, personne et le 'je' du discours dans le Pacifique et au-dela Resume Sahlins fonde son interpretation de l'histoire heroique polynesienne en partie sur l'utilisa- tion du pronom 'je' par les chefs pour referer a la totalite de leur groupe. Mosko (1992) sou- tient que l'accent que Sahlins place en consequence sur'l'inclusion' comme modalite d'action des chefs est diametriquement opposee a celui que place Strathern sur la 'partibilite', soit l'effacement de parties de la personne comme condition prealable a l'action. A partir de materiaux comparatifs sur les Hautes Terres de Nouvelle Guinee, oiu les hommes importants utilisent aussi le 'je' en reference a leur groupe entier, et des rapports de Benveniste et Urban sur l'utilisation des pronoms personnels, je soutiens au contraire que des moments d"inclu- sion' et de 'partibilite' sont tous les deux inherents au langage. Ils correspondent a deux dimensions distinctes qui donnent sens aux pronoms (le sens 'indexical direct' et le sens 'anaphorique'). Une attention detaillee portee sur l'interaction entre ces deux sens peut apporter de nouvelles clartes sur la nature de la personne et de l'action dans la societe.
