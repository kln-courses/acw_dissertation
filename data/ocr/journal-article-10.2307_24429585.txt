PARADOXICALLY, it's ancient literatures that may be best posi tioned to accommodate whatever replaces the conventional book. Having survived transitions from oral to writ ten, from scroll to codex, and from manuscript to print, classical texts can appear indifferent to the particular forms they have taken over time, always ready to move on to something new. Yet it is striking that from the start, the ur-epic Gilgamesh (geograph ically, the Uruk epic) is thoroughly self conscious about its material underpin nings. After telling us to look beyond the present to "see" the wall of Eanna, "view its parapet," and "take the stair way of a bygone era," it asks us also to look through the object in our hands and See the tablet-box of cedar, Release its clasp of bronze! Lift the lid of its secret, Pick up the tablet of lapis lazuli and read out The travails of Gilgamesh —The Epic of Gilgamesh (tr. Andrew George) A poem that first circulated orally, and only survived because of the dura bility of cuneiformed clay before com ing comparatively recently to the alpha bet and print, begins by insisting on a particular and particularly pompous instantiation. So doing, it prepares the reader with the Penguin edition in hand for a story that, like Gilgamesh, has come "a far road." Crawling across millennia, some texts don't so much slough off their earlier carapaces as accumulate fragments to help them and us move along. Not too long after Gilgamesh was committed to stone, Plato reported Socrates' famous denunciation of writing in Phaedrus. This again self consciously invokes the material form of text, beginning with the jovial Socrates antedating Mae West by a couple of millennia to ask the coy Phaedrus whether that is a scroll beneath his cloak. A little later, this cel ebrated enemy of writing tells Phaedrus, "You will lead me all over Attica and anywhere else you please by waving the leaves of a speech in front of me." The allure of the physical is again unavoidable, if still ambiguous. Although what most of us now think of as "the book"—the codex form made up of pages bound to a spine— began to spread not long after Socrates, it took more than six hun dred years for it, rather than the scroll, to lead Western readers where they pleased. This technological triumph is usually explained in terms of the codex's greater efficiency. But such accounts have to assume that pagans, Jews, Indians, Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese, all of whom advanced quite happily without the codex, had no interest in efficiency, even though the last three were centuries ahead of the West in the development of the impres sive efficiency of print. In fact, the codex is more likely to have spread among the new Christians of the West, and later the Islamists, not for its effi ciency in delivering text, but for its ability to signify that its holder was bound for a new religion, not still enrolled in the old. (It should not be surprising, then, that enthusiastic read ers of e-books sometimes resemble new sectarians.) Both Andrew Piper in Book Was There and Leah Price in How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain look back to the rise of the codex, noting its symbolic and practi cal contribution to the conversion of Augustine of Hippo. In response to the visionary command tolle, lege (take it and read), Augustine had dived ran domly into the Bible—something more easily done with a codex than a scroll —and taken inspiration from what he had found. Nevertheless, despite the contribution of the codex to the mak ing of this Church Father, Christians were, as Price notes, uncomfortable with the book as a physical object, fearing accusations of idolatry or "bib liolatry." As if to escape the continuing influence of this aspect of Christianity, both authors seek to present "the book" as more than just an abstract text that binds itself with ease but without commitment to one particular form or another. Piper is a professor of German at McGill University and an editor of Goethe's works. His earlier Dreaming in Books explored the bibliolatry of the Romantic period—a form of worship that caused Balzac to compare books to opium. In her previous book, Anthologies and the Rise of the Novel, Price, a professor of English at Harvard, directed attention to the neglected anthology as a kind of com pression technology for Western thought. In their latest books, both Piper and Price again confront their disciplines' disregard for the book's material form. But this time both are also attempting to address the concerns of a broader audience. Piper draws on ancients and moderns (including an intriguing selection of contemporary conceptual art) to help us "understand the relationship between books and screens." Price looks at what people did with books (and printed objects more generally) to "understand the printed 'before' against which so many twenty-first century commentators measure their digital 'after.'" That gray-screened eminence, the digital book, provides pretext and subtext for both these accounts. Despite their shared search for "understanding," however, the two take separate and usefully contrasting routes. Piper, who feels at ease with both paper past and digital future (he "was not just a reader as a child, but also a computer user"), offers primarily a personal meditation. Dreaming in Books explored Germans' belief that their books shaped their dreams, and in Book Was There Piper considers how modern books have shaped his own dreams, while asking whether their replacement will be able to shape his children's. Understanding the con tribution of the physical shape of the book to the shape of dreams, he believes, can help ensure safe passage to a new form, as long, he cautions, as we don't "hold too tightly" to the old. Driven by concern that "material culture remains absent from our train ing," Price casts herself as an ethnogra pher setting out to discover what peo ple and books actually did in the nine teenth century. Consequently, where Piper is primarily comforting, Price is more sternly corrective. Hers is a schol arly assault on bibliophilie pieties, but equally a bibliographic assault on scholarly pieties. (She reprimands me for anthropomorphism in discussing books, quite rightly no doubt.) Thus when Price looks at childhood reading, it is not to dream, but to expose the sentimentality in Dickens's account of David Copperfield's retreat to the nov els left him by his father. Such scenes, she notes, set up the stereotypical and self-serving Bildungsroman theme in which children retreat from humilia tion and abuse into the insulated but isolated world of reading, only for that to turn them into adult novelists able to engage with the social life of books. Piper explores this social life through an account of the German pleasure of reading in the woods, which "brought ...readers and their books together in new ways." Later, however, examining the Ramsays reading together in To the Lighthouse, he concedes that reading can be "a sign of what cannot be shared." Looking at similar issues, Price turns to Trollope and a scene from The Small House at Allington where the two charmless honeymoon ers, Adolphus Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina, hide behind books and newspapers to avoid contact of mind or body. For Price, it is not so much that books unfortunately and inescapably isolate readers (what in the spirit of Yeats might be called the "perpetual virginity" of the mind), but rather that people aggressively "do things" with books—and for her this includes keep ing and even beating others away. Piper calls his chapter "Sharing" and ends with a sanguine view of our desire to share readings and the implications for Facebook, arguing that "if holding [books] is a precondition of dreaming, facing is a precondition of caring." (Piper has a tendency to struggle for aphorism.) Price, by contrast, calls her chapter "Repulsive Books" and goes from there to explore divisions and inequalities underwritten by books.
