Rodgers Published online: 25 January 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract Changing images of work in discourse both portray and co-constitute the shift from an industrial to a postindustrial economy. Specifically, work metaphors appear in extra-scientific and intra-scientific discourse on workers and work struc- tures in the natural and social world. An analysis of the entomological discourse from the late nineteenth century to the present shows changes in these metaphors that overlap with the discourse of change in human work and organizational structures. For instance, the metaphor of a busy bee within an efficient hive had traditionally evoked a comparison to the modern industrial workplace. The dis- course on the hive currently more closely resembles a postindustrial conception of work. Discourse analysis can illustrate the role of language in co-constructing shared changes in image of work. Keywords Work metaphors • Social insects • Postindustrial • Discourse analysis One of the ways that changes in the forms of work has been expressed over time - in both scientific and popular discourse - is through the use of metaphors. Social insects, in particular ants and bees, are often used in metaphors relating to human work, while descriptions of and terms associated with human work conversely inform the perception of social insect work behavior found in these metaphors. A human worker is complimented for being "a busy bee." Situating the metaphor "busy bee" within a larger work setting gives us the image of productivity as does a similar image of the "industrious ant." Certainly these metaphors of ants and bees appear in a vast range of literature as role models for human workers (Sleigh 2003). Scientific discourse on social insects by and large supported the ideas that social insects were paragons of efficiency. The described division of labor in early natural D. M.

Rodgers history and entomological literature paralleled that of a modern industrial human society workplace. The entire hive or colony becomes a metaphor used to evoke images of the entirety of work behavior and structures. It is telling then that changes in the discourse correlate to changes in human work and the economy. So how does a busy bee or industrious ant become an unemployed forager? The answer lies not in a shift in the work behavior or work structures of social insects but in discourse on human work as it links with scientific discourse. As Lakoff and Johnson (1980) maintain in their classic work on metaphors, objective reality is not simply reflected in metaphors; instead, conceptual metaphors are embodied and cultural constructions. Metaphors also have the ability to shape reality through their influence on conceptual systems (pp. 145-146). Work metaphors found within scientific discourse attempt to present a neutral and universal view of the structural arrangement of work. Although they are not neutral or universal, they create a model of work that naturalizes particular arrangements and rules out other possibilities.1 However, these conceptual metaphors are socially constructed from our experience of work and our cultural choices in the way we structure work. Combining work metaphors with scientific discourse of the natural world co-constructs and legitimates images of both the social and natural world of work through their interaction. Metaphor in Natural Scientific Discourse The knowledge and practice of science can be examined through scientific discourse and specifically metaphors. As Donna Haraway (1989: 4) explains: "Scientific practice may be considered a kind of story-telling practice - a rule-governed, constrained, historically changing craft of narrating the history of nature. Scientific practice and scientific theories produce and are embedded in particular kinds of stories. Any scientific statement about the world depends intimately upon language, upon metaphor. The metaphors may be mathematical or they may be culinary; in any case, they structure scientific vision."2 These scientific visions can include the world of work through the stories they tell about what constitutes the natural world and how it connects to the social world. Studies of social insects that use descriptions of human work appear informed by the changes occurring in the language of human work. Ants and bees themselves have not suddenly begun to reorganize their work and their colonies to fit postindustrial realities; instead, this interpretation has been attributed to them. This new social insect metaphor becomes accepted as natural; it is first "discovered" through scientific authority and then 1 Lakoff and Johnson (1980) note of all conceptual metaphors that, in the attempt to shed light on an unknown concept, they also end up hiding features of that concept. In particular with scientific and work discourse, what is hidden are the local and cultural practices of both science and work. 2 Scientific discourse is used by the scientific community, which claims objectivity and universality even as it creates specialized knowledge. Teun A. van Dijk (2003) notes that the specialized knowledge of scientific communities creates specialized stories. This specialized discourse occurs within a social context of structures such as universities and conferences. The specialized discourse is thus both created within these structures and also shapes the authority of these structures (pp. 31-33). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="3">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 47 used to co-construct and legitimate the idea of postindustrial work conditions for humans and insects through discourse.3 As Sommer (2000) notes, "...activities in science are always guided by ideas about the world, and the theories resulting from these activities may sometimes be imposed on rather than derived from reality... In this process, scientific discourse is of considerable importance, as every manifes- tation of it either supports or challenges these naturalized ideologies" (pp. 17, 19). Maasen and Weingart (2000) indicate that larger constructions of knowledge can be viewed as metaphoric units to study (p. 150). The concept of the hive/colony has a history of representing a grounded and familiar image to help explain a more abstract human work environment. Although the hive/colony is not easily traced as a unit, empirical evidence of its components can provide the contours of this larger metaphor. Documenting changes in these components can then illustrate a shift in the overall metaphor of the hive/colony and its significance to other discourses. As Maasen and Weingart (2000) propose, metaphors transfer from one discourse to another and the changes they undergo can be studied to reveal knowledge dynamics. One can predict that a metaphor, once successfully transferred into a variety of discourses in a variety of ways, will increase its attractiveness for other discourses too, thereby generating a self-enforcing network of all discourses involved, be it public, professional, or scientific ones. Both aspects of metaphors, their transferability and their linkage function (at the same time producing and produced by discursive interactions), may thus eventually accomplish its global significance-local differences notwithstanding. In this way, analyses of metaphor transfers can help to understand how, gradually, discourses are transformed, scientific paradigms shift, world views overturned (Maasen and Weingart 2000: 37-38). Analyzing how work is portrayed metaphorically through scientific discourse can tell us something about the ideas of human work and the work environment. This is not because language causes social or natural reality; rather, language becomes part of the co-construction of social structure through discourse. Metaphors Used to Describe Human Work Metaphors abound in general descriptions of human work and the workplace in the social science literature (Créticos 2007). Metaphors have been created to describe specialized professions and occupations (Ardichvili 2001; Duffy 2001; Mansilla 2003), gendered aspects of work (Burnier 2006; Ollilainen &amp; Calasanti 2007), and the shifting relationship between work and personal life (Moen 2005; Halpern &amp; Murphy, 2005). Metaphors have also been used to describe the change in types of work in postindustrial society. There are metaphors about knowledge workers 3 Naturalization of work and economy through metaphor obscures the existence of local arrangements or beliefs about work. Meaning and practices associated with work thus become presented as universal and inevitable reality. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) explain how metaphors can constitute reality: "This can begin to happen when we start to comprehend our experience in terms of a metaphor, and it becomes a deeper reality when we begin to act in terms of it" (p. 7). â Springer</page><page sequence="4">48 D. M. Rodgers (Fisk 2005); service work (Weaver 2005); and emotion work (Froggatt 2001); white-collar workers and "broken ladders" (Cappelli 2008). Work inequalities have also been expressed through metaphors. While some workers advanced up career ladders or glass elevators, the glass ceiling metaphor coined by Gay Bryant in 1984 reflected the stratification of work opportunities for females (Frenkiel 1984; Maume 1999). McBrier and Wilson (2004) suggest that the glass elevator metaphor can also be used to reflect the downward mobility of white-collar African- American workers that began in the 1990s. The larger workplace has also been described metaphorically. Gareth Morgan's Images of Organization (1986) proposed eight metaphors for organizations, and this model has been frequently applied to analyze workplace organizations. Organiza- tional changes emerging from the "new economy" have been described metaphorically and analyzed discursively (Chiapello and Fairclough 2002; Graham 2002). Metaphors are clearly significant in discourses of work and are used to attempt to capture the qualities of specialized work, inequalities, or to explain changes in work patterns. The use of metaphor is not often critically examined for its role in constituting cultural ideas about work. For instance, metaphors of work intersecting with gender, race, and class may serve to reify these categories and naturalize them or lead work research into a narrow direction (Wright &amp; Baxter 2000). Lakoff and Johnson (1980) claim that the structural metaphors describing time and labor as a resource represent cultural ideas about work for a Western industrial society. LABOR AS A RESOURCE and TIME AS A RESOURCE are by no means universal. They emerged naturally in our [Western] culture because of the way we view work, our passion for quantification, and our obsession with purposeful ends. These metaphors highlight those aspects of labor and time that are centrally important to our culture. In doing this, they also deemphasize or hide certain aspects of labor and time. We can see what both metaphors hide by examining what they focus on (p. 67). Just as metaphors found in scientific discourse are used in a dominant grand narrative, so too are metaphors for work presented as universal human experience. This oversimplifies the interpretation of what work means for humans and restricts the knowledge of choices they may have in structuring work. The RESOURCE metaphors for labor and time hide all sorts of possible conceptions of labor and time that exist in other cultures and in some subcultures of our own society: the idea that work can be play, that inactivity can be productive, that much of what we classify as LABOR serves either no clear purpose or no worthwhile purpose (p. 67). Not only are work metaphors influenced by the culture and experiences they are embedded in, they can also shape our social reality (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). The literature on work has resulted in metaphors that pervade popular discourse and create an image of the current work ethos and work climate. In 1973, Daniel Bell proclaimed the beginning of a shift in work toward the postindustrial. This became an overarching metaphor to describe many changes taking place following the â Springer</page><page sequence="5">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 49 modern industrial period of work and work organization. The postindustrial metaphor provided the image of an information society, but also a loss of manufacturing and the uncertainty of restructuring work environments (Champlin and Olson 1994). 4 The postindustrial was framed as a natural process rather than a social construction through the use of metaphor. As the essays in the volume edited by Philip Mirowski, Natural Images in Economic Thought , attest to, images of the economy have historically been naturalized through metaphor (1994). Once naturalized, they legitimate and perpetuate a particular social interpretation of what an economic system is and how work is structured. Social and natural discourses overlap and co-constitute each other. Discourse Analysis of Social Insect Work Metaphors Given that social insect metaphors related to work appear so frequently and have maintained over time, it might be assumed that these metaphors will "reflect" the changes in the work of humans. Through analyzing entomological texts of the modern industrial period, a transitional period, and the postindustrial period, I illustrate how the change in metaphors used to describe the work of social insects was influenced by a new postindustrial discourse of human work. Once this socially created metaphor describing the natural world became established, it then served to legitimate the new image of work within the social world, creating a legitimating loop from social to natural and back again. I created typologies of the metaphors drawn from industrial and postindustrial literature to illustrate the changes these metaphors reflect in the discourse of work. Descriptions of the overall work patterns and organization of bee or ant colonies shifted significantly over time, making identifiable distinct industrial and postindustrial work metaphors. I used critical discourse analysis to analyze primary texts within the field of entomology.5 Critical discourse analysis recognizes that language should be interrogated for its role in constructing knowledge and practices (Fairclough 1995). 4 As one of the reviewers of this paper pointed out, ubiquitous use may create a dead metaphor, and then it may give rise to new or perhaps distorted interpretations. Klamer and Leonard (1994) claim that "dead metaphors never actually die" and rather are "ossified metaphors" that can be reanimated (p. 39). If both "industrial" and "postindustrial" are to be considered dead metaphors, so ubiquitous has their usage become, some of their metaphoricity might be reanimated by new target domains and new entailments. The metaphor of postindustrial may take on new qualities unintended in Daniel Bell's initial use (1973), through the postindustrial social insect work metaphor. The transfer of the term to the natural world and back again to the social reinvigorates the idea and adds new meaning. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) refer to this as a "reverberation" that may influence our future experiences (p. 140). 5 As a specialized field within the larger scientific community, entomological discourse also uses metaphors that signal the claim to universality, obscuring the local qualities of scientific belief and practice and highlighting the unity of a scientific culture. An interesting illustration of perceived universality of knowledge claims can be found in an announcement encouraging participation in the 201 1 Entomological Society of America conference: "One World, One Science, Just One Meeting, Entomology 2011" (Annual Meeting Program Planning Committee, email communication, July 26, 2011). The new postindustrial work metaphor appears in social insect articles featured in international scientific journals and helps to shape what appears on the surface to be a unified specialized scientific discourse following the norms of a specific scientific culture. â Springer</page><page sequence="6">50 D. M. Rodgers Within the critical discourse analysis, I also specifically turned to the insights of metaphor analysis to understand the constructions of metaphor within this discourse (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Maasen and Weingart 2000). I analyzed the literature in roughly two main time periods: industrial and postindustrial, coding for work role, organizational structure and economic metaphors. My sample was taken from early classic entomological texts on social insects by John Lubbock, Maurice Maeterlink, René de Réaumur, Karl von Frisch, and William Morton Wheeler, which serve to represent the discourse in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Discourse describing human and insect work behavior and organization did not immediately change after World War II and continued to largely reflect the earlier industrial work concepts and overarching theories. I use the work of prominent entomologists such as Charles Michener, E. O. Wilson and others to represent this ongoing dominant discourse. By this time, the field of entomology had become more professionalized and the discourse drew less from the fuzzy boundaries of naturalists and entomologists and more exclusively from the work of entomologists. Included in this transitional time period are texts from the mid-twentieth century to the 1990s. As the discipline developed, the creation of specialty journals in particular added to the patterns of discourse. To analyze the shift in discourse from the late 1990s onward, I used entomological journals in the social insect subfield such as Insectes Sociaux and others such as the Annual Review of Entomology that specifically include articles on social insects. One of the characteristics of postindustrial work is an engagement with new forms of computer technology, and therefore the interdisciplinary literature on computer systems, work, and social insects was also an important source I used to identify changes in the discourse of work. 6 Together, these sources from the late nineteenth century until the present show a distinct shift in the discourse concerning social insect work and social organization. Overall, the early metaphors appear to mirror the language used to describe industrial human work and, by the 1990s, the discourse on social insect work begins to fit the emergence of postindustrial work. I turn now to what I consider the components of the Modern Industrial Social Insect Hive/Colony. Early Metaphors of Social Insect Work and Work Organization In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the descriptions of the human workplace, work roles and the dominant scientific discourse on social insect colonies reflected hierarchical social structures (Rodgers 2008). In the change from 6 Insect Sociaux is the journal of the International Union for the Study of Social Insects and represents specialized research on social insects. Annual Review of Entomology represents the specialized knowledge of the discipline overall, including reviews of the most significant research on social insects. Interdisciplinary research combining social insects and new technologies is an emerging and international endeavor. The research of entomologists may be found in more generalist science journals that are interested in this new interdisciplinary research. The articles from these sources show a similar pattern in their use of the postindustrial work metaphor when compared with the more specialized social insect journals, illustrating an overall shift in the entomological discourse. â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 51 agrarian to industrial society, the images and ideas of science paralleled the changes taking place in the world of work. This conceptualizing of work and the division of labor was founded on a hierarchical model. Gates argues that this was far from coincidental: "The scientific enterprise had an impact on Victorian society, but social change also shaped the ways in which scientists continually reordered nature. Here the notion of 'ordering' nature takes on ideological connotations. . .[T]here was nothing natural about the conception of the natural order presented by Victorian scientists and intellectuals; the social and natural order existed together in dynamic tension" (Gates 1997: 179-80). Supporting the rise of industrial order and rigid division of labor, hierarchal metaphors and analogies found their way into organizational theory and ideas about work and the workplace until significant changes in the late twentieth century began to require new metaphors and analogies. Until then the metaphor reflected and reinforced hierarchical organizational structure and work roles. Social insects were held up as models of work and work organization for many reasons, perhaps foremost of which were their perceived success and similarity to humans. Often their work was even viewed as superior to that of humans. Work in the insect world was not only specialized but also described as a moral duty for the collective good of the hive, reflecting a "spirit of the hive" (Maeterlinck 1901). Applying the "spirit of the hive" metaphor to human economy and work made capitalism and early industrialism more palatable in America (Withington 1988). Insects were described as skilled laborers guided by their collective interests, and many authors attributed intelligence to their work tasks and accomplishments. [L]et us endeavour to form some conception of the sureness of vision, the accurate calculation and industry [of] our little people... In the void round about them they must lay the plans for their city, and logically mark out the site of the edifices that must be erected as economically and quickly as possible... And in this labyrinth of complicated buildings, so far existing only in imagination, laws of ventilation must be considered, of stability, solidity; resistance of the wax must not be lost sight of, or the nature of the food to be stored, or the habits of the queen; ready access must be contrived to all parts, and careful attention be given to the distribution of stores and houses, passages and streets.... (Maeterlinck 1901:136-37). The intelligence of the social insects-or at least their evolved status-was also described as being evidenced in their hierarchical division of labor and the insects' work roles and tasks that were given anthropomorphized names such as "soldier," "nurse," "farmer," and "scout." The metaphors of work and the division of labor tended to be fairly consistent, and classic entomological texts by Huber, Réamur, Fabre, and others were recounted in natural history and other popular collections, thereby creating an accepted dominant discourse. A hierarchical specialized organization of work was portrayed as the height of efficiency: Huber has found that there is a division of labour among the workers; one set of workers are finished architects, who plan and build the edifice-they at the same time are the nurses of the young; while the other are mere bricklayers ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">52 D. M. Rodgers and plasterers, who only bring the raw material, but do not give it shape. The former he calls the nurse-bees; the latter, wax-workers (Anonymous 1843: 49-50). In a more general sense, the description of social insects' hard work and long hours made them a good model for nineteenth-century human factory workers, who were required, in a period of unregulated capitalism, to work hard and long. Praise for the hard work of social insects is plentiful in the discourse: "Wonderful are the labors of this class, and truly may they be called 'workers,' for never did industry show a brighter example of indefatigable perseverance, than in the labors of this little insect" (Miner 1849: 20). The bi-directional quality of the work metaphor is apparent, as the social categories in the entomological discourse become the insect metaphors that naturalize the human work environment, legitimating particular work structures and work roles. John Lubbock's studies with ants served as empirical evidence of the industriousness of ants, backing up what might otherwise appear to be mere moralizing: In industry, ants are not surpassed even by bees and wasps. They work all day, and in warm weather, if need be, even at night too. I once watched an ant from six in the morning, and she worked without intermission till a quarter to ten at night. I had put her to a saucer containing larvae, and in this time she carried off no less than a hundred and eighty-seven to the nest. I once had another ant, which I employed in my experiments, under observation several days. Before I came up to London in the morning, and when I went to bed at night, I used to put her in a small bottle, but the moment she was let out she began to work again. On one occasion I was away from home for a week. On my return I let her out of the bottle, placing her on a little heap of larvae, about three feet from the nest. Under these circumstances, I certainly did not expect her to work. However, though she had thus been six days in confinement, the brave little creature immediately picked up a larva, carried it off to the nest, and after half an hour's rest returned for another (Lubbock 1890 [1879]: 75). "Sunup to sundown" became the typical phrase used to describe the length of social insects' work hours, but, as the above passage suggests, their work time may extend into the night as necessary. This may even require temporary time away from the colony: "The workers are often out before sunrise and still booming busily about after sunset. Occasionally a bee works until dark and then is obliged to camp out in some convenient blossom until morning, when it will come home laden with yesterday's prizes" (Michener &amp; Michener 1951: 92). Workers are generally described in the modern industrial colony as helping each other as "sisters." While queens may experience rivalry, workers band together over their common goal of the colony's welfare. The value of their work is paramount and unquestioned: The workers are the architects of the association. They construct the cells, arrange their size and distances, repair damages, &amp;c., &amp;c. They are laborers of Springer</page><page sequence="9">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 53 the family; they gather the honey and farina, and compound the food for the young bees, and upon their skill and labors depend the prosperity of the colony (Miner 1849: 20). In his empirical studies, Karl von Frisch' s documented observations of the honeybees' "waggle dance" opened the door to understanding communication and cooperation among these honeybee sister-workers. The task of foraging included communicating food sites to other honeybees in the colony. Through an intricate dance pattern, the foragers conveyed the distance and direction of food to the workers labeled "newcomers" (1953 [1927]). Less complex forms of communi- cation found in some species were described as maximizing the success of other foragers. In an experiment conducted by one researcher in 1967, the purpose of communication is clearly spelled out: "A feeding table was installed 50m from the hive. The forager bees first alert their sisters in the hive; then they place trailmarks on grass or stone with the secretion of their mandibular glands. Immediately afterward, the alerted novices attain the goal" (Lindauer 1967: 451). The metaphoric quality of the waggle dance and other forms of communication about food sources rely on an image of sharing resources with the "sisters in the hive." The "dancing" is social; communication is cooperative and meant to train the other workers into foraging successfully for the good of the entire colony. The work of the hive depicts many types of work and workers, from "nurses," "guards," "soldier," "scouts," "farmers," "dairyman," to even "slave," and "child laborers." No matter what the type of work performed, the worker can expect to have lifetime employment. The only member of the honeybee colony exempt from the rule of constant hard work is the "drone," whose task as a male reproductive is to attempt to mate with the queen. As Michener and Michener describe the lifelong work of the honeybee, it is clear that each stage of life has a specialized task: Each worker as it makes its debut begins a regular sequence of duties apportioned according to its age. Freshly emerged bees do not work for the first day or two. The subsequent life of the worker may be roughly divided into three phases. In the first the principal function of the bee is as a nurse. In the second phase the bees make short flights from the hive. It is bees in this stage that secrete wax. In the third phase, which usually begins about three weeks after emergence from the pupa, the bees forage for nectar and pollen. As young are more or less continually produced during the spring and the summer, there are ordinary bees present in each of the three stages at all times (Michener &amp; Michener 1951: 110-11). The worker at each stage is assumed to be making a valuable contribution to the colony, including the older worker: Young workers in the first phase are kept busy bringing honey and pollen from the storage cells to feed the queen and the drones as well as feeding their larval brothers and sisters. How busy they are is indicated by the fact that a single larval bee averages 1,300 meals per day! . . . Meantime the field hands, the older workers, are busy every day with their equally important contributions to the bee community (Michener &amp; Michener 1951: 111-12). Springer</page><page sequence="10">54 D. M. Rodgers In the dominant discourse, this highly efficient system of work appears to be orchestrated from some source of central planning, which in earlier literature had mostly been attributed to the queen. Other authors remained vague but still evoked images of authority: "The bees go about their collecting as systematically as though their duties were posted on a bulletin board for them after being carefully planned by a superior bee brain" (Michener &amp; Michener 1951: 112). The systematized work was often compared to an industrial setting: In a colony of bees division of labour is arranged as thoroughly as in a boot and shoe factory where a number of hands are employed, each in a different capacity: one for cutting the leather, another for stitching the cut out parts on a machine, a third for hammering nails in, and so on. Each one by keeping within the strictly limited range of certain activity requires a special skill. Something very similar takes place in the bee's workshop: here the various activities are distributed among various groups of bees to such an extent that even the foragers are subdivided into a group of nectar-collectors and one of pollen-collectors, each group devoting itself exclusively to its own particular task (von Frisch 1927: 14). E. O. Wilson (1971) proposed a factory/fortress model to describe colony organization. Oster and Wilson (1978) elaborated on this with attendant metaphors of capitalism: Viewed from within, the colony is like a factory enclosed in a fortress.... In order to maximize its colonial reproduction, the colony must extract the greatest possible amount of energy from the environment and convert it efficiently into colony growth. At the same time the colony must protect its investment, and especially the welfare of the queen, from the enemies that threaten the nest at all times. To maintain the nest as a fortress is costly in time and energy. Defense cannot be perfect, some loss must be sustained. Ideally the level of defense is that which combined with the foraging and nurturent strategies, yields a growth pattern enabling the colony to convert its capital of immature forms and adult storage tissue into the largest possible crop of reproductive forms (p. 22). Not just the defense of the colony, but also industrial work is portrayed as dangerous. After McCook describes the death of ants during their work routines, he makes an analogy to the human occupational hazards: "in the larger field of industry and research, our race, has its daily tragedies, not wholly unlike these which befall the citizens of an ant-hill. The martyrs of industry, heroes and heroines; the fallen soldiers of the great army of labor, are thus going forth daily to perish in the path of duty" (1909: 160). Work as portrayed in the social insect metaphors of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries captured the hierarchical, industrial workplace, which although consisting of danger and requiring hard work and long hours, also ensured lifetime job security and conveyed some sense of belonging, cooperation and protection through participation in the work environment of the colony. Work was presented as skilled and imbued with moral potential for individual workers who were described Springer</page><page sequence="11">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 55 Table 1 Modern industrial social insect hive/colony Individual works for common good Worker needs to sacrifice to the work environment Industrious, works from "sun-up to sundown" (with exception of drone) Tasks rigidly defined by age or by physical qualities Works for colony until death Factory/fortress model (Wilson 1971) as contributing to the good of the general colony. Busy bees and industrious ants were working within the context of the larger productive economy of the hive or colony. The Modern Industrial Social Insect Hive/Colony contains general themes that might be summarized as: individuals who work for the common good of the colony; workers who are willing to work long hours and sacrifice to the larger environment; caste-related tasks based on age or morphology; and a factory setting where workers have lifetime jobs (see Table 1). Social Insect Work Metaphors of the Late Twentieth &amp; Early Twenty-First Centuries Metaphors relating to work began changing in the social insect literature of the late twentieth century. Entomologist Deborah Gordon who pioneered studies in "task switching" among foraging harvester ants proposed a parallel-distributed model for the division of labor, and she addressed the change in paradigm of viewing worker tasks in terms of metaphors about worker roles and work organization. Recognizing that the Fordist model was constructed around Adam Smith's notion of an invisible hand of the market, Gordon explained that this no longer applied to human societies and probably never did for insect societies (1989). She likened the organization of work to something more closely resembling the working of the brain (1999). This brain metaphor is also used by Morgan (2007) as one metaphor for human organizations and is viewed as self-organization. A new co-constructed metaphor of work and work structures was being created within the social science and natural science discourse, each domain reinforcing the other in the shift away from the industrial metaphor. The self-organizing of ant colonies (Gordon) or of human organizations (Morgan) best represents what is viewed as "uncertainty" in environments and the role of individuals in such environments. The image of an uncertain and/or flexible environment is often linked with a postindustrial economy. As the world of human work shifted from industrial to postindustrial, a highly specialized and rigid organizational model no longer explained the new complexity of organizational relations (Barley 1996). Individuals were no longer tied to one position in a hierarchical chain of command, but rather operated as independent agents in the larger economy (Sennett 1998). Springer</page><page sequence="12">56 D. M. Rodgers Camazine et al. (2001) engage the concept of self-organization to explain the foraging of honeybees in a new way that sounds similar to Sennett's description. The first significant change these researchers offer in the interpretation of this work pattern is the lack of a hierarchical leader giving out work directions: "the mechanisms appear to arise entirely from the actions and interactions between foragers bees rather than on guidance from an external, directing influence. Studies have failed to find any supervisory leader of the foragers" (p. 191). Foragers are described as on their own in finding food sources and, contrary to the previous belief that the queen bee or even a more diffuse control such as a "bulletin board" might be the centralizing force, the researchers find no centralization within the organization. There is no blueprint to which foragers could refer to know what spatial distribution they could create. A blueprint is a static plan, whereas the allocation pattern of a colony's foragers is highly dynamic as the ever- changing array of flower patches in the surrounding countryside presents the bees with a kaleidoscopic array of food sources. These dynamics also preclude the bees from following a stereotyped sequence of actions, or recipe, to create the proper allocation pattern. . . [A] forager bee must be able to respond flexibly to her food source, sometimes advertising it to nestmates, other times exploiting it quietly, and still other times abandoning it altogether. Such flexibility in behavior is the antithesis of executing a rigid behavioral recipe (Camazine et al. 2001: 192-93). Although self-organization might potentially be liberating or empowering to the worker, the downside to the insect metaphor becomes apparent in the new terminology for foragers: "An important first step toward understanding how the allocation process works is to distinguish between employed and unemployed foragers; between foragers currently exploiting a patch of flowers and those that are not" (Camazine et al. 2001: 193). This terminology is a radical departure from previous conceptions of industrious worker bees all working together toward a common goal. Camazine et al. elaborate on the specific behaviors of "employed" and "unemployed" foragers in regard to nectar collecting. They incorporate von Frisch' s "waggle dance" communication behavior that alerts other bees to the location of nectar sources. As previously discussed, the waggle dance indicates distance and direction of the nectar source. These authors reframe this division of labor surrounding nectar gathering by explaining that the "employed" workers are bees that come back and share information about a work site, whereas "unemployed" workers are the bees that receive the information. They identify the particular area of what von Frisch called the "dance floor" as the place that this process takes place. The metaphor of "employed and unemployed bees" is extended further: "The collective effect of this decision-making by the employed foragers is that the dance floor functions as a labor clearinghouse where employed foragers advertise high-quality work sites and unemployed foragers listen to their nestmates announcements to learn about these work sites" (Camazine et al. 2001:198). The unemployed workers are portrayed as having to rely on informal networks for information about "high-quality work sites." There is no guarantee of work Springer</page><page sequence="13">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 57 provided by the "queen bee" or emanating from the needs of the hive. The "unemployed" are on their own and natural selection occurs at the individual level. This non-hierarchical, decentralized work environment is similar to the one described in postindustrial accounts of human work, in which the employer is no longer responsible for the well-being of the employee, and individuals must fend for themselves in the new economy. The disappearance of the formal hierarchy found in the modern, centralized, bureaucratic organizational forms, however, does not imply the development of an egalitarian system. Harrison (1994) claims that in regard to these human organizational changes, increased inequality becomes a "dark side of flexible production." This "dark side" appears in the entomological literature as well: The process of allocating foragers among nectar sources may be viewed as akin to natural selection; that is, a decision-making process in which the distribution of individuals among alternative states (food sources, in this case) is determined not by a high-level, well-informed supervisor but simply by the differential survival (persistence of food source) and reproduction (recruitment to a food source) of the individuals, each responding to its own, immediate set of circumstances (Camazine et al. 2001: 201-02). The term "swarm intelligence" has been used to describe how individual agents adapt to the uncertain environment. Using the metaphor of swarm intelligence promotes emulation of social insects as models in a new way. Such workers are not dedicated to one task for the good of the colony, which then in turn gave the individuals security and prosperity; rather, workers with swarm intelligence cultivate the ability to make individual decisions that reflect responses to the larger collectivity. Hughes (2005) discusses the human managerial use of a new "emotional intelligence" and a different sense of moral responsibility that suits the work of the flexible economy. The human worker must be more "intelligent, adaptive and reflexive" (p. 603). If workers can make the right decisions and successfully adapt, they may be able to survive. This new swarm intelligence is being used as a human business model that offers a "swarm of possibilities" (Bonabeau &amp; Meyer 2001). The work environment is viewed as a complex, adaptive system (Bennet &amp; Bennet 2003; Metcalfe 2005). A similar description emerges in the entomological literature. A 1989 entomology article describes a new way to view the foraging of ants in which the changes in the environment are seen to require more pressure on the individual: "The unpredict- ability of the resource environment of a colony may require that foraging be fine- tuned through experience-based change in the behavior of individual workers to enhance efficiency" (Traniello 1989: 204). Traniello at this point also proposed a bounded rationality explanation for any lack of success of the individuals and viewed individual foraging as only one option that might exist alongside collective decisions. It would seem that Traniello's idea of the bounded rationality of individuals ends up being offset by the idea that a self-organizing system does not need as many skilled individuals in specialized roles. Because of this, self-organizing benefits the overall colony while it deemphasizes the skill of the individuals: "There are theoretical reasons to suppose that a large decentralized colony can be both efficient Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">58 D. M. Rodgers and reliable (high probability that tasks are completed) even when the individuals tackling the tasks are simple and not especially competent" (Anderson &amp; McShea 2001). Anderson and McShea further explain that, "efficiency and reliability can be achieved by having redundancy" (p. 220). What this means for the "subunits" involved is that there will then be "many (spare) individuals in the vicinity of a task who are able to tackle that task. Even though all the individuals may not be fruitfully employed, at least the task will be completed" (p. 220). It is clear that while the idea of self-organizing systems captures complex group behavior, it includes reductionist assumptions about the individual "units" within that group. These individual units may then be viewed as more dispensable in the overall system. And these assumptions are being held true for social insects and humans. Nigel Franks and Chris Tofts (1994) proposed a "forage for work" algorithm that challenged the idea that older workers age into foraging. In the scenario they describe, there is not any particular task advancement with age; rather, "individuals tend to work first near the centre of the nest and then move up and down a colony's production lines in search of a task (forage for work) if they are currently unemployed. Workers may move upstream if the output of their current efforts is accumulating because not enough workers are available downstream" (p. 470). Task switching in social insects may also be assessed in terms of its cost- efficiency, and other ways to allocate work tasks might be used instead. Hofstede (2005) performs an experiment and finds his test species of bees to mostly recruit unemployed workers rather than engage in "task switching," and this is seen as a rational "cost-efficient" strategy: When we assume that the new foragers of the second day were mostly unemployed on the first day of the experiment, which has been found in honeybees (Seeley 1997), this seems to be a low cost solution. Switching might be costly, especially when foragers are successful on the first day of the experiment, as is the case in our study. By recruiting unemployed foragers, the other foraging tasks can continue without interruption. Recruiting unemployed foragers is only possible, however, when a colony has a reserve supply of labour. . .These unemployed bees might serve as "labour in stock" for situations when sudden changes in colony needs or food availability occur (Hofstede 2005: 94). Although the idea of a "reserve army" of workers had been recognized in nineteenth-century human work literature, it did not appear to have the same meaning in the entomological literature until it was paired with the metaphor of "unemployed" workers in social insect colonies. In 1992, Gene E. Robinson's summary of the literature and the changes in division of labor described "changes in the proportion of individuals working" (p. 642). According to Robinson, growing acceptance was found in studies concerning the inactivity of large groups of workers in colonies, and these workers were described as "uncommitted reserves." Therefore, the newfound "unemployment" of social insect workers might still be explained as good for the entire colony: "Reserve workers thus represent excess labor that can be mobilized to defend the nest, compensate for a loss of workers due Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 59 to colony fission or prédation, or exploit newly available resources, among other things" (Robinson 1992: 642). Evans' (2006) study of termites examines inactivity or "resting" among foragers that respond to sudden tasks, and considers the possibility that reserve labor is the best way to explain this aspect of their division of labor. The new terminology of unemployment for social insects is also paired with a loss of "benefits" in the literature. Peter Nonacs and Kem Reeves (1992; 2004) describe a loss of "benefits" in their work with Polistes wasps and metaphorically claim that the "social contract" has been revoked in wasp societies. This has thereby changed work strategies and what might appear to be workers' attitudes, judging from the language the researchers use to describe the wasps: We have modeled such cooperation in a transnational framework that predicts: the level of benefits needed to retain subordinates; and the reactions of wasps to perceived changes in their "social contract." We have found that: (i) Subordinates are particularly sensitive to manipulations of sexually- destined offspring and reproductive skew can change markedly with the season; and (ii) A significant fraction of wasps neither begin their own nests or engage in cooperative behavior. Instead they are floaters, waiting for opportunities to usurp weak foundresses or adopt orphaned nests (http://www.eeb.ucla.edu/indivfaculty .php?FacultyKey=1505). The threat of an outsider queen usurping a colony has not usually been portrayed in the literature as a result of breaking the "social contract" or as a reaction to the lack of "benefits." Another shift in the idea of "outsider threat" can be found in the description of "alien workers." The colony has always been described as needing defense against intruders and having parasitic animals inside the colony. Sometimes these were referred to as "alien" insects, but this did not generally refer to other workers. Indeed, not even unrelated species taken into the colony as larvae were labeled "alien workers." The colony was considered "closed" to outsiders (Wilson 1971). The literature defines unrelated workers as those who "immigrate" or "drift" into a colony (Pfeiffer &amp; Crailsheim 1998). Soro et al. (2009) describe a nest that "contained foreign or alien workers unrelated to the queen, and it was these alien workers that reproduced in the presence of the queen" (p. 2). Workers who are described as "alien" can acquire that status when a queen from outside of the nest takes over the queen's nest before the workers of the nest emerge from the larval state. Challenging the earlier view of a closed colony, Matsuura and Nishida (2001) cite the "cost and benefit" strategies of social insects when gaining "additional labor force" (379). At times, "alien workers" are positioned opposite "resident workers" (Lopez-Vaamonde et al. 2004). How this situation came to be seems to be unknown, and "[t]he question of why drifting workers are accepted into a foreign nest remains open" (Soro et al. 2009: 7). Moritz and Neumann (2004) sense a failure in the usual mode of defense against intruders: "Nestmate recognition is the basic mechanism for rejecting foreign individuals and is essential for maintaining colony integrity in insect societies. However, in honeybees, Apis mellifera, both workers and males occasionally gain access to foreign colonies in spite of nest guards (=drifting).... Foreign bees were â Springer</page><page sequence="16">60 D. M. Rodgers identified by maternity testing. The proportion of foreign individuals in a host colony was defined as immigration" (p.681). The article concludes that the level of admission is low because of the techniques of recognizing a nestmate through odor cues. The discussion in this article includes the subtitle "Regulation of foreign drones and workers" (p. 681). Workers are more often portrayed in the postindustrial literature as lazy and cheating; they "take advantage of the hardworking members of their colony" and even create a "social cancer" in the colony (Dobata et al. 2009; Jordan et al. 2008; Pelletier &amp; McNeil 2004; Royal Society Press Release 2008; Smith et al. 2009). The new morality lesson is that basically "not all workers are honest" (Beekman &amp; Oldroyd 2008, p. 30). The honeybee hives and ant colonies are no longer described as secure havens filled with hardworking and cooperative workers. Freed from leadership from above, workers experience more competition and conflict with each other. Researchers' metaphors incorporate the ideas of selfishness, increased worker competition, and worker policing; researchers challenge the idea of cooperation as explained by kin selection because the idea of cooperation itself is challenged (Foster &amp; Ratnieks 2002; Johnson 2001; Hailing &amp; Oldroyd 2003; Ratnieks 1988). Darwin's age-old problem of "altruism" is resolved not by explaining why it happens but rather why it does not. Reflecting a Foucauldian sense of power, Wenseleers et al. (2004) cite not only "policing" by other workers that controls reproduction, but also note that this "social policing should select for 'self-policing,' resulting in most or even all the workers deliberately refraining from reproduction, even if they retain ovaries" (p. 1042). Sundström and Boomsma (2001) describe the recent discovery of intracolony conflict and policing in this way: The very establishment of such worker control has made new conflicts come to light, between mothers and fathers and between adult individuals and brood. Evidence for these conflicts is only just beginning to be gathered. Recent studies tend to include issues such as 'information' and 'power' (i.e. the ability to perceive signals and the opportunity to act upon this information) and to address selection for selfishness at the individual level with costs of social disruption at the colony level (p. 515). Beekman and Oldroyd (2008) challenge Wilson's earlier idea of a factory/ fortress model and discuss the anarchistic selfishness that occurs, "when workers disunite" (p. 20). Not only is the colony subject to invasion from without, but also "an insect society is susceptible to exploitation by rogue reproductive workers that can harness the brood-rearing capacity of a colony to enhance their personal reproductive success" (p. 20). This realization about insects is seen as helpful in understanding the complexity of systems overall. The metaphoric shift encourages new studies in areas that might more closely parallel a particular view of human society: "until recently, scientists were burdened by the widespread view of insect colonies as harmonious entities sharing none of the strife that so often characterizes our own societies" (p. 20). The new postindustrial social insect hive/colony includes overall themes of: self-interested workers needing to be individually flexible and adaptable to survive in the environment; diminished work ethic with an image of Ö Springer</page><page sequence="17">Shifting Scientific Discourse on Work 61 Table 2 Postindustrial social insect work hive/colony Individual works for own self-interest Worker needs to individually adapt to the environment Worker may be lazy, "cheating other hard workers" Task switching defined by individual choice/colony need as organism Worker may be "unemployed" Self-organization, complex adaptive system workers who are lazy and cheating; tasks not set for workers but rather defined by choice or changing need of colony which is self-organized; workers who may be "unemployed" (see Table 2). Discussion and Conclusion The "freedom" of the new economy as viewed through the postindustrial social insect hive/colony features a worker free of bureaucratic rules and rigid tasks and subject instead to the simple rule of survival where an ever-shifting field of work has become the norm. Organizational structures are no longer "top-down," centralized, hierarchical entities but are decentralized, flexible and dynamic. Individuals are agents who determine their own fate. As recognized by Lakoff and Johnson (1980), new metaphors not only provide a unique way to understand society and belief systems, they also "have the power to create new reality" (p. 7). And Maasen and Weingart (2000) maintain that changes in metaphors across discourses can explain the dynamics of knowledge that link subsystems, creating large-scale shifts in our beliefs and practices. The social insect work metaphor within the scientific discourse has shifted from an industrial to a postindustrial description of the hive/ colony. It is not a given that bees will be eternally viewed as busy or ants as industrious. These supposedly simple metaphors always reflected a larger commentary on the state of human work and will tend to change as human understanding changes or in the context of work patterns. As Knorr-Cetina (1981) points out: "The scientist's suddenly recognised similarities include elements of decision and persuasion, and consequently of change as well. In this sense, the similarities which underlie a metaphor or an analogy are complex rather than primitive, fragile and temporary rather than basic and stable" (p. 51). Earlier social insect work metaphors delivered a moral message in their allusions to an industrial economy and division of labor. This provided a model for human work roles and larger economic structures that served to justify these particular industrial work relations. Analysis of the social insect metaphors of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries indicates that a new image is being presented that parallels the discourse on the postindustrial work patterns of human society. This shift in the work metaphors in scientific discourse plays a role in co-constructing and legitimating the reality of postindustrial work for human society by naturalizing the social construction of work.
