<plain_text><page sequence="1">who defy such categorization. This does make Chaucer unique and does also distinguish him from contemporaries such as Langland and the Lollard poets. While Hodges's book certainly is not the last word on this subject, it does establish the new baseline for future research. It also provides a useful resource for the Chaucerian scholar by gathering all this information into a single volume. Hodges's ideas open up several avenues for further investigation of the pilgrim portraits and her technical examination of the costume descriptions never loses sight of the overall context of Chaucer's work. This book is only the first volume of two. The second half of this project, focusing on the clerical pilgrims, should be awaited with interest. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, CORK SAMANTHA MULLANEY Shakespeare's Third Keyboard: The Significance of Rime in Shakespeare's Plays. By LORNA FLINT. Cranbury, NJ: University of Delaware Press; London: Associated University Presses. 2000. 205 pp. [30. Making Sense of Shakespeare. By CHARLES H. FREY. Cranbury, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press; London: Associated University Presses. I999. 210O pp. [30. The title of Lorna Flint's book derives from Alfred Harbage's description of Shakespeare as having 'three keyboards at his disposal', a 'typical Shakespearean script' containing 2,700 lines, sixty-seven per cent of them blank verse, twenty-four per cent prose, and nine per cent rhymed verse (p. I3). Flint observes that the last (and so far only) book-length study of Shakespeare's rhyme was F. W. Ness, The Use of Rhyme in Shakespeare's Plays (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1 94 ), and we can agree that new work is urgently needed on this important stylistic resource. Unfortunately, this book has several serious failings, and does not advance our knowledge. Rhyme is initially an acoustic or phonic phenomenon, depending on agreed standards of pronunciation, so it is astonishing that the author never inquires into how Shakespeare's English was actually pronounced. This omission is the more serious in that the standard authority, Helge Kokeritz, Shakespeare's Pronunciation (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, I953), actually includes an index to all the rhymes in Shakespeare's works, totalling 8170. Flint also fails to give any attention to rhetoric, even though her category of 'full rimes' often includes words repeated within a line or sentence. Such repetitions are in fact instances of common rhetorical figures, such as epistrophe (repeating a word at the end of a line or clause), ploke (repeating it within a line or clause), and so on. The device which is described as 'near doublets' (p. 8I) is actually the rhetorical figure hendiadys. Flint gives only a cursory account of the treatment of rhyme in Elizabethan literary criticism, failing to note that the rejection of rhyme by proponents of classical prosody was due to its being a much later, 'Gothic' invention, as they contemptuously termed it. These failures to draw on historical scholarship are especially surprising in that the book is a revised doctoral dissertation accepted by the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford- upon-Avon, supervised by Stanley Wells. The book contains seven short chapters, discussing the rhymes found in prologues, choruses, songs, visions, masques, and so forth, and two longer ones, considering the use of rhyme in All's Well That Ends Well (pp. 87-I 4I) and King Lear (pp. I42-89). Unfortunately, the author never develops any analytical methodology for dealing with rhyme, and confuses quotation with analysis. Generally, rhymes are said to illustrate characters or attitudes that are taken as read within the standard critical traditions. In the two long chapters a great deal of plot summary cannot conceal the fact that rhyme remains a subsidiary device, and can provide only a very limited approach to two such complex plays. Reviews I70</page><page sequence="2">MLR, 97.1, 2002 I7I If Lorna Flint's book is under-theorized, and insulated from much historical criticism, that by Charles Frey (which carries a glowing recommendation from David Bevington) bristles with theories, urging us to read the past through the eyes or, rather, all the senses of the present. The 'Sense' of his title does not refer, as one might imagine, to the plays' meanings, but to their impact on the senses. Frey wants us all to activate not just the senses of seeing and hearing when we read Shakespeare (a process he prefers to experiencing him in the theatre), but also those of touch, taste, and smell. 'Shakespeare', he tells us, 'belongs to our bodies as much as to our minds' (p. 67). He describes himself as a 'bodyworker' (p. 107), a 'bodyreader' (p. 68), one of'a diverse and courageous band of body-reverencers' (p. I67). Frey warns us: 'Unless one reads with kinesthetic and proprioceptive sensitivity (that is, sensitivity to one's empathic sensations or bodily motion and of internal bodily sensations), one fails to feel' Shakespeare's descriptions (p. 32). As that sentence shows, he has adopted some pseudo-scientific terminology from 'bio-aestheticists' and from 'experts in aesthetic anthropology, biogenetic evolutionary analysis, and sociobiology of ritual' (p. 43), a powerful combination. Accordingly, Frey's prose abounds with such terms as efferent, afferent, visceral, somatic, motoric, imbricated, mentation, ergotropic and trophotropic. Much of this laboratory jargon seems to me simply out of place, for a vast gap exists between empirical studies of rhythm as it affects the measurable sense-response of experimental subjects in laboratory conditions and the verse-styles of Richard III, say, Macbeth, or The Winter's Tale. The only organs that can evaluate the functionality of verse in these plays, and the great range of effects that Shakespeare learned to exploit, involve not the body but the mind and aesthetic sensibility, trained, experienced, and self-critical, capacities that Frey rejects, indeed subjects to mockery. As for the difference that Frey's approach would make to the interpretation of Shakespeare's plays, that can perhaps be judged from the following passage, one of many hectoring the reader into realizing that he 'can hardly hope to apprehend the reach of Shakespeare's images without sensuously exploring them': When, for example, after the discovery in Macbeth of the murdered King Duncan, Banquo declares (2.3. 132) 'In the great hand of God I stand', no abstractive translation could possibly replace the value of physiologically imagining what it would be like actually to stand in the enclosing hand of God. To bring kinesthetic and receptive memories into play, feeling what it is to breathe within secure embrace, radiant warmth, a high platform of support, the vast hands of divine protection around a tiny infant (again, not of woman born or cradled?), or whatever sensations embodied subjects summon up, is to begin appropriating and liberating the image for both vital and individuated experience. Shakespeare, through Banquo, invites a paradoxically physical appropriation of spiritual power. Whereas Macbeth's analogous image might be ' "Amen"/Stuck in my throat' (2.2.36), a proprioceptive image of being unable to breathe the spirit, to feel the wind of spiritus, an interior connection to God, Banquo's image of standing infolded in God's hand fits with Duncan's statement to Banquo: 'let me infold thee/And hold thee to my heart'(I.4.31-32). Macbeth's fear or pride encloses and bottles up his Amen, whereas Banquo is enclosed, planted in a place of spiritual nourishment and reward. (pp. 91-92) That seems to me a turgid and inappropriately literal response to a traditional metaphor used to describe a Christian believer's sense of God's protectiveness. Like other such tropes, such as feeling secure 'under the shadow of thy wings', it needs to be interpreted in a generalized way as an image of security, not literally spelled out in this unimaginative manner. Frey's anthropomorphic God, cradling Banquo in his 'vast hands', is reminiscent rather of Gulliver in Brobdingnas, and any notion that 'the wind of spiritus' involves 'an interior connection to God' is likely to arouse</page><page sequence="3">derisory flatulence. Frey's appeal to his readers to practise 'a more strenuous and joyful sense-reading' (p. I66) is likely to fall on deaf ears, if such are to be its fruits. ETH ZURICH, CENTRE FOR RENAISSANCE STUDIES BRIAN VICKERS The Tempest. Ed. by CHRISTINE DYMKOWSKI. (Shakespeare in Production) Cambridge, New York, and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press. 2000. xxxii + 373 Pp. C45 (paperback CI5.95). This Tempest, like the other volumes in the Cambridge series, is a record of performance rather than an edition of the play. The editor assumes the reader's familiarity with the play's language and provides no glosses of arcane words or contextual information. Printed in a different font at the bottom of the page, the commentary consists entirely of details that illustrate the disparate ways a particular scene or even a single line have been enacted since the Restoration. Occasionally the notes demonstrate that performance itself can provide textual commentary. Editors have searched hither and yon to determine the origins of Caliban's 'scamels' in II.2.148, and the OED lists Shakespeare's play as its first usage. Most editors admit that the word's meaning is obscure but suggest that it must be some kind of shellfish. Dymkowski notes the cuts and emendations that have been offered since Dryden and Davenant and then describes some business from the Birmingham Repertory production of I994 that conveys the same message: 'When Caliban offered to get "scamels", Stephano looked at Trinculo and mouthed the word with a puzzled shrug; Caliban then gave him a shellfish, which clarified the matter' (p. 230). Although there are limitations to the number of productions that can be referenced in such a volume, Dymkowski offers a broad range from the Restoration's adapted version through the I99os. British productions understandably dominate the list, but she does include the most important US productions (George C. Wolfe's for the New York Shakespeare Festival in I995, for example) and several from Australia and Europe. The decision to omit adaptations (such as Aime Cesaire's Une Tempete) narrows the perspective as well, and while a Eurocentric focus may have been necessary, it is disappointing given the tremendous impact Shakespeare's play has had on post-colonial cultures in the Caribbean, Africa, and India. Within those limitations Dymkowski admirably weaves stage business from promptbooks, tidbits from actors' memoirs, and passages from reviews into a coherent performance history. She also lists cuts in the text and describes costumes and scenery. For each scene and at the introduction of each character, she provides an overview of the range of possible interpretations. The five-page commentary describing the setting of Prospero's island in 1.2, for example, shows how scenic design has varied according to the producer/director's view of Prospero and his powers. Similarly, the note to v. I. 130-34 surveys approaches to Antonio's silence: 'Antonio's silence allows free interpretation of his response, both to Prospero's forgiveness and to his resumption of ducal power, and actors have run the gamut from humble gratitude to sneering villainy'. Then she provides examples. Macready and Burton's Antonios knelt in acquiescence, while Thacker's remained aloof and Alexander's grinned but 'quickly wiped the grin off his face when his brother also demanded his dukedom back' (p. 312). Compelling as the insights gleaned from such commentary can be, the most valuable component of this edition is the introductory essay. Dymkowski divides her material into six sections. First she addresses what we know about the play's earliest performances at the Blackfriars theatre, then she provides a summary of the changes Reviews 172</page></plain_text>
