<plain_text><page sequence="1">Felix Culpa and Felix Roma: On the Program of the Sixtine Staircase at the Vatican Corinne Mandel ForJoaneath Spicer Adjacent to the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, abutting the Last Judgment wall, is a staircase providing access to the chapel, the Borgia apartments, the corridor leading to Raphael's Stanze, and, for the visitor with special permission, St. Peter's basilica. The staircase is, in short, one of the most oft-trodden thoroughfares of the Vatican complex, yet its frescoed vault, painted for Sixtus V (Peretti, 1585-90) by a team of artists working under the direction of Cesare Nebbia and Giovanni Guerra around 1586, has been virtually ig- nored (Fig. 1). Only two of the feigned panel paintings depicted on the vault, representing Sixtus V and the Muses, and the Sixtine Chapel at S. Maria Maggiore have merited specific mention and illustration (Figs. 4 and 6);' the remain- der of the vault has neither been discussed in the literature, nor been documented in photographs.2 The program ad- dresses the sexual mores of the time, and is exceedingly provocative: while condemning the salacious proclivities of certain members of Christ's flock, it harnesses these proclivi- ties in allegorical form to create a vision of Sixtus V's Church Militant. The staircase vault is essentially divided into four sections, following the architecture (Fig. 2).3 The central section, with which I am primarily concerned, is barrel-vaulted and contains four narratives, punctuated by grotteschi and person- ifications, surrounding the prominent, centrally placed coat- of-arms of Sixtus V (Fig. 3). This stemma is composed of a rampant lion, holding a branch with three pears in his right forepaw, and crossed by a bar with three mountains and a star. On a basic level, the lion refers to the pope's magnanim- ity and, according to some, to his first name, Felice or Felix, meaning happy; the pear branch, to his surname, Peretti; the three mountains, to Montalto, the town where he was schooled; and the star, to both the Virgin and the polar star.4 The narratives on the coves each present the pope as his zoomorphic alter ego. The one on the eastern cove shows the lion with keys and a globe, being crowned by a winged victory and attended by the Muses, while objects emblematic of secular and religious power hang on the Peretti pear tree behind him (Fig. 4). Opposite this scene of Sixtus V and the Muses is the lion, with keys and a shield, standing atop a hill watching satyrs and satyresses banding together, and nymphs taking flight (Fig. 5). Flanking the stemma on the vault proper are iconic images, painted as quadri riportati, which seem rather less related than the unusual, though by no means unique, combination of Muses, satyrs, and nymphs. One represents the Sixtine Chapel at S. Marza Maggiore, the private burial chapel of the pope and his mentor, Pius V (Ghislieri, 1566-72), and the new home of the crib of Christ and its enclosing grotto of the Nativity, shown at the center of the chapel structure (Fig. 6). The other quadro shows the Sixtine lion now located in the sky, holding keys, and looking down on the triple mountains of the Sixtine heraldry encir- cled by three crowns, its tiers enclosing women dressed in chaste white and funereal black, as well as couples yoked together in obedience, and, perhaps surprisingly, gaily dressed. Boars, finally, flee the mountainous enclave. This quadro represents the Prohzbition ofAdulterers (Fig. 7). The four narratives, while quite diverse in subject matter and format, are clearly related formally. The scenes on the cove take place in mountainous locales, as does the vault narrative featuring the mountains of Sixtus V's stemma. The Sixtine Chapel, by virtue of its domed crown and splayed lower section, also has a configuration remarkably akin to the heraldic mountains. The lion is a constant, too, in three of the four scenes, and in each of these he holds two keys, symbols of his Petrine descent; as shall become clear below, the wayward lion of the Sixtzne Chapel is actually present in a symbolic sense. The qualities held in common by the main narratives accordingly relate to the personal armorial bear- ings of the Peretti pope, the patron of the program (Fig. 3). Just as the papal stemma physically occupies a central place in the cycle, so the pope is celebrated as its protagonist. Four female personifications are interspersed with the quadri and stemma on the barrel vault. Reading from north to south, the first personification is located above the Szxtine Chapel. She has a flowing veil of fortune, and holds the cross in her right hand and the brazen serpent in her left. This figure may be called Change on the basis of a similar personification identified as such by an inscription in the Salone Sistino of the Vatican Library (1588-89). Beneath the Sixtine Chapel and above the central stemma, a female person- ification holds a closed book, keys, and what appears to be an I should like to thank the anonymous reviewer of The Art Bulletzn for providing extremely useful criticism of my work, and George Donaldson for being a good-natured sounding-board and for offering valuable editorial advice.

Beneath the central stemma and above the Prohibition, another woman, holding an open book and scepter, con- forms to traditional depictions of Merit.5 Finally, beneath the Prohibition, a personification, identifiable as Pontifical Jus- tice, or as a more pointed Sixtine Justice, holds the papal tiara in her left hand, and an orb in her right. The sections flanking the central barrel vault consist of groin vaults populated by grotteschi, lunettes decorated with landscapes, and the ubiquitous personifications. At the far end of the vault, lunettes with landscapes on the eastern and western coves (Fig. 8) flank the southernmost lunette contain- ing two personifications seated beside a central Sixtine stemma. The personifications and stemma act as summations of the cycle when the viewer descends the stairs en route to the basilica, following the primary orientation of the painted program (Fig. 9). The personification at the left holds a globe of world dominion, gestures to the dove of the Holy Ghost, steps on a devilish serpent, and has a bag, probably containing money, at her side. On the basis of personifica- tions once depicted at the Villa Montalto (1589), and now in a private collection, this extraordinarily endowed woman may quite simply symbolize Faith, or Grace.6 The personifica- tion at the right holds a key in her right hand, and a scepter and the pear of the Sixtine heraldry in her left, recalling a personification represented at the Lateran Palace (1588- 89). She may be identified as Sixtine Justice, or perhaps as Pontifical Authority.7 At the northern end of the vault, joining the central, barrel-vaulted section, is another groin vault decorated with grotteschi and flanked on the coves by lunettes with land- scapes. The band that abuts this section of the barrel vault in turn contains a central stemma flanked by personifications within feigned frames on the coves, echoing the disposition on the southernmost, terminating lunette. The one on the western cove, that is, the same side as Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs, holds an ax and scales (Fig. 10).

The scepter could conceivably replace the regal crown, and the notion ofjustice, evidenced by the scale, could be understood in the personification of the stairway lunette.

The pendant personification on the eastern cove of the stairway, symbolizing True Faith or Knowledge of the True God, lifts a veil from her face and holds an open book facing downward, toward the anguished severed heads of heretics located beneath her feet-heads probably lopped off by Justice's ax (Fig. 11).9 Just as the quadri in their diversity have common bases, ultimately tied to the patron of the program, the landscapes, personifications, and grotteschi are thematically interrelated, and finally illustrative of the Sixtine pontificate. The land- scapes, containing vignettes of fishermen and farmers, are pastoral surrounds, evocative of the contemplative life and the renewed Golden Age. They also appear to display pagan ruins and Christian buildings, connoting the translation from the antique, pagan world to the present, Christian one, and the concomitant triumph of the Faith over heresy.'0 The 8 On Castigation, see Ripa, I, 76-77. 9 Compare the veil of Veritas in the Sala di Daniele of the Lateran Palace.

Such a duality seems also to be stated by the personifications framing the Sixtine Chapel, the Sixtine coat- of-arms, and the Prohibition: Change celebrates the transla- tion from the Old Dispensation to the New, and Dignity, the exalted nature of Christianity and of its earthly leader; Merit suggests the Church Militant led by Sixtus V, and Pontifical Justice, the power with which Christ's vicar may offer salva- tion to his flock. The larger personifications likewise convey such complementary notions, with Justice and Sixtine Justice demonstrating the necessarily defensive vehicles by which salvation may be achieved, and the Christian Golden Age, or Parousia, enjoyed; and Faith and True Faith revealing the necessity of extirpating heresy, whether in the form of the serpent, the severed heads, or, as shall be explained later, the boars, satyrs, and even the nymphs of the feigned panel paintings, in order to embrace Christ and the Church. That Sixtus V is the supreme vehicle by which heresy is to be expunged, and the Golden Age renewed, is made abun- dantly clear in the figure of Sixtine Justice, who holds the sweet Peretti pear, a fruit evocative also of both the Virgin and Christ."I The point is reinforced, finally, by the grotteschi, composed of elements of the Sixtine stemma, and housing personifications holding-in addition to the trumpets and wreaths of fame, swallows of the Resurrection, burning candles and flaming urns of holy love, a variety of liturgical instruments and papal symbols"2-the very same armorial bearings so prevalent in this, as in all Sixtine cycles: moun- tains, pears, and stars (Fig. 12).

Identified here as Divine Providence, this personification holds a wreath of fame in her left hand; she is accompanied by an eagle perched on a base, possibly signifying renewal or divine inspiration, and she points to an open book with her right hand, symbolizing knowledge; an aureole encircling her head possibly alludes to Apocalypse 12:1.13 The flanking, terminating lunettes on the western and eastern coves do not contain landscapes. The western lunette, in line with Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs and Justice, contains the three Parcae: one holds the spindle, significantly formed of an ouroboros, symbol of eternity; one, the distaff; and one, located at center, a golden fabric (Fig. 14). The choice of this golden garment in lieu of the fateful scissors reinforces the Roman, as opposed to the Greek, nature of these women, and indicates that these are indeed the be- nevolent Parcae, overseers of births and marriages, and not the wretched, haggard Fates.14 Specifically, the fabric held by the central figure recalls Stilicho's cloak, woven of the same golden thread to ensure the return of the Golden Age.15 This 13 For the open book and wreath, see nn. 8 and 11 above.

Continuing the idea of the pope's fated and beneficent birth and wedding to the Church conveyed by the flanking cove lunettes, the terminating lunette at the northern end gives the pope's zoomorphic alter ego the leading role (Fig. 16). The lion, now partially hidden by a surveillance camera, stands on hind legs beneath a baldachin, and receives a wreath held by flanking winged victories, while at the corners burn flaming urns, echoing the plethora of fiery urns and burning candles that punctuate the grotteschi of the vault. The foregoing description, although by no means com- plete, furnishes an idea of the overall thrust of the vault's program: the beneficent, just, and vigilant pope Sixtus V has been chosen by the Parcae, in Christian translation, Divine Providence, to rule the respublica Christiana, fostering the love of God in his subjects, and expelling from Christ's flock those unwilling to conform. In so doing, the pope recreates the Golden Age and prepares the Church Militant for its translation to the Church Triumphant. The program would seem, in other words, to convey the same message so often propagated in the artistic commissions of Sixtus V and of the Roman Catholic Reform Papacy, indeed, of the Papacy in general. Typically, it does so by pitting praise against blame, and good against evil, bridging the pagan and Christian traditions, and transforming them into something particular</page><page sequence="7">THE PROGRAM OF THE SIXTINE STAIRCASE 71 0 w 10 Justice (photo: author) to the patron. It is, of course, the specifics that separate this program from all others, especially the unique and some- what idiosyncratic quadri that depict the historically perti- nent subjects and the particularly Sixtine response to them. Nevertheless, without the evidence of other artistic cycles and texts, both anterior to and contemporary with the Sixtine pontificate, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to divine the meaning of the quadri featured in this cycle. The combination of the Parcae and their chosen ruler, satyrs and nymphs, Apollo and the Muses-the main actors of the coves-recalls the program of the Vatican Casino of Pius IV (de'Medici di Milano, 1559-65), in which Apollo and the Muses are joined by sirens and satyrs.16 As Fagiolo and -tit W?L?- JL 4jr lop 11 True Faith (photo: author) Madonna have shown, the Casino program is essentially concerned with the musical harmony of the spheres as ruled by the Sun and the Moon, or Apollo and Diana.17 While the rulerships of Apollo and Diana are common to both pro- grams, as shall be shown below, the Sixtine vault is not primarily concerned with music. The lead satyr does hold a syrinx, and there are bells in the grotteschi, yet the Muses seem to hold their traditional, non-musical attributes (Fig. 4). Of the nine Muses, only the four in the foreground, behind the lead Muse, carry attributes. The first holds a book and may be identified as Calliope, Muse of epic poetry. The second has a comic mask, and therefore represents Thalia, Muse of comedy and pastoral poetry. The attribute held by the third Muse is difficult to identify: if it is a scroll, then she may be identified as Clio, Muse of history; if it is a flageolet, then she might be Euterpe, Muse of lyric poetry. The fourth Muse seems to hold a quill and inkpot, and may be identified provisionally as Polymnia, Muse of heroic hymns. Terpsi- chore herself, Muse of dancing and song, who generally 16The combination also closely approximates the program of the ephemera created for the triumphal entry of Charles V and his son, Prince Philip, into Antwerp on September 11, 1549. However, the precedent is not useful for the purposes of this study since modern scholarship has not yet determined why the combination was used. Consult W.

Two fruitful possibilities are in St. Peter's basilica and in the Vatican Palace itself, because, without exception, Sixtine programs take into account the function of the structure and the location in which they are frescoed (or modeled). For example, the program of the Lateran Palace, possibly written by Pompeo Ugonio, is shaped by the Constantinian baptistry and the imperial history of the Patriarchium Lateranense, and it presents the central role played by Pope Sylvester and the converted emperor Constantine in establishing Christianity as the religion of the empire, and in securing sovereignty for the Papacy. It also recalls the work of Saint Francis of Assisi, who held up the tottering palace in Pope Innocent III's famous dream, and of the Franciscan Pope Sixtus V, who rebuilt and refurbished the structure.19 In the Esquiline district, the cycles of the Villa Montalto, very possibly devised by Sixtus V himself, essentially recall the imperial origins of the pastoral site and relate to Christ's providential birth during the Golden Age of Augustus. These cycles draw attention to the signposts of Christian salvation erected from the beginning of the world, with pagan "types" of Christ like Hercules, Judaic types like Moses, converted pagans like Emperor Constantine, and followers of Christ like Saint Francis and, 18 For Muses in a musical and cosmological context, see Comes, chaps. viI, xvI; and Valeriano, chap.

The cycle includes depictions of pagan (both historical and mythological) and Christian sages, historical repositories of learning, and the gamut of Church councils, as well as Christ, his vicars, Popes Sylvester and Sixtus V, and the Church's first imperial "fighting arm," Emperor Constantine.21 It is not known whether Rainaldi was charged with devising the stairway 20 V.

In Fontana's notebooks recording payments for the build- ing and decorating of the stairway, reference is consistently made to "the staircase that leads to the Gregoriana."23 The Gregoriana is the chapel built by Sixtus V's hated predeces- sor, Gregory XIII (Boncompagni, 1572-85), and located behind the pier of the northeast crossing of St. Peter's in proximity to the Sistine Chapel and Sixtine staircase. Func- tioning as a burial chapel for the pope, a reliquary chapel for his namesake, Saint Gregory Nazianzus, and a home for the miraculous image of the Madonna del Soccorso, and deco- rated, or, rather, encrusted in precious marbles emulating Early Christian art, the Gregoriana is a fundamental source for the Sixtine Chapel in function, form, and meaning.24 The visual representation of Sixtus V's answer to the Gregoriana on the vault of the staircase giving access to the basilica might then prepare visitors for the splendor awaiting them inside the earthly re-creation of the Heavenly City.25 One may find little apparent reason for Sixtus V to have drawn attention to the chapel of his despised predecessor, notwithstanding the stairway's function. Nevertheless, it was surprisingly common practice for Sixtus V to have work done on projects begun, and sometimes even completed, by Gregory XIII, although he naturally found it necessary to impose his imprint on that of his predecessor. For example, Sixtus V purchased Gregory XIII's villa at the Quirinal, and continued to embellish the structure; he employed his artists to complete the fresco cycles in the Sala di Costantino and Galleria delle Carte Geografiche at the Vatican; and he, or one of his iconographers, drew on and transformed Gregory XIII's impresa of the Boncompagni dragon sheltering his flock from inimical lions for his own Extirpation of the Bandits (Fig. 24), now featuring the beneficent Sixtine lion.26 If the Sixtine Chapel may be viewed as heralding the Gregoriana awaiting visitors on the stairway, it also calls attention to itself and conjures up in the mind's eye of visitors the even greater magnificence awaiting them at S. Maria Maggiore. Much as the Sixtine lion of the Extirpation subverts the Boncompagni -ink" Niri 4. Niii 16 The Leonine Sixtus V Crowned by Winged Victories (photo: author) dragon, the Sixtina may be read as outdoing the Gregoriana. By connecting the Vatican to the Esquiline in this context, finally, attention is also drawn to the Virgin, to whom Sixtus V was profoundly devoted throughout his life, and to whom surprisingly little pictorial devotion is provided in the adjoin- ing Sistine Chapel, in the Borgia apartments, and, indeed, in the basilica of St. Peter's itself. The solar imagery of the staircase vault finds an important parallel in the Parnassus of the Stanza della Segnatura. Although here, as in the Casino of Pius IV, the emphasis is still musical, owing to Apollo's lira da braccio, Raphael's fresco essentially represents the same subject as Sixtus V and the Muses. In a larger sense, the solar symbolism of the Parnassus, as analyzed by B. L. Katzive, finds a complement in the pervasive solar symbolism of the Sixtine pontificate, evi- denced in the stairway cycle in the aforementioned cove narrative, in the vault narrative featuring the Sixtine lion ablaze with light in the sky, and in the preponderance of fiery urns and burning candles.27 Another significant and related parallel can be found next to the staircase vault, in Michelan- gelo's Last Judgment Christ, who is represented as Sol-Apollo within the cosmos, as V. Shrimplin-Evangelidis has recently demonstrated.28 The connection with the Last Judgment is furthered by other components as well: the anguished heads beneath True Faith, the evil serpent beneath Faith, the fleeing boars of the vault narrative, and, as I shall endeavor to prove, the satyrs, satyresses, and nymphs in the cove narrative of Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs all relate to Michelan- gelo's damned. The figures of Justice, Faith, True Faith, indeed all of the personifications, as well as the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic Sixtus V, relate to Christ-Apollo the 22 Antoniano is the likely iconographer of the Sixtine Chapel at S.

With such readily discernable parallels, one must leave open the possibility that a cosmological reading underlies the Sixtine cycle. Whether such a reading is in keeping with that espoused by Julius II (della Rovere, 1503-13) or by Paul III (Farnese, 1534-49), or, for that matter, by Alexander VI (Borgia, 1492-1503) and by Leo X (de'Medici, 1513-21) in the Borgia apartments, will have to await analysis. Inasmuch as the Borgia bull pervades the paintings created for Alexander VI, and the de'Medici lion populates the paintings created for Leo X in the Borgia apartments, the Sistine Chapel, and the later Stanze, it is clear that zoomorphic symbolism was not lost on the author of the program of the Sixtine staircase.29 Now, I shall turn to the Salone Sistino of the Vatican Library. This cycle has already been useful for the identification of personifications on the stairway vault. The Salone Sistino is indispensable with regard to the quadri riportati flanking the Sixtine stemma on the central barrel vault, since both images are actually represented again in the library, where they are accompanied by inscriptions and hence presented as em- blems. Whereas the stairway vault has been largely over- looked in the literature, the Salone Sistino has merited a considerable amount of attention, notably during the late sixteenth century.30 Together with the evidence of other Sixtine texts and images, the late sixteenth-century explana- tions of the narratives may be harnessed in order to pene- trate the particularly Sixtine import of the stairway cycle. The first quadro riportato one sees, in accordance with the primary orientation of the staircase vault, is the Sixtine Chapel (Fig. 6). The chapel is represented as an entity unto itself, rather than in tandem with the basilica of S. Maria Maggiore, to which it is in reality attached. As such, the depiction agrees with the manner adopted in the portraits of Sixtus V and His Good Works by Giovanni Pinadello, published by Nicolas van Aelst, and by one Battista from Parma (Figs. 17-19), and in the Salone Sistino emblem (Fig. 20).31 Where the portraits contain only identifying labels for the Good Works of Sixtus V, the subscriptio of the emblem in the library provides a specific way to read the imago. In particular, the text acknowledges the relationship between the pagan goddess Diana and the Virgin Mary: "VIRGINIS ABSISTIT MIRARI TEMPLA DIANAE,/QVI FANVM HOC INTRAT VIRGO MARIA TVVM" (He who enters this shrine of yours, Virgin Mary, ceases to marvel at the Temples of the Virgin Diana).32 Of the many temples built in honor of the virgin Diana in antiquity, Angelo Rocca singles out one of particular signifi- cance, that belonging to Diana of Ephesus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.33 The Sixtine Chapel, under- stood as an autonomous church in the Salone Sistino imago, as in the portraits and quadro of the stairway vault, has accordingly replaced the ancient temple in Ephesus, and therefore assumed the latter's function as the religious locus of all of Asia, now translated to Rome and the respublica Christiana.34 By similar association, the Sixtine Chapel has become a symbol of the synthesis of earth and sky, or, in the words ofJohn Raymond, a place "so glorious that whosoever enters, will even imagine himselfe in some place above terrestriall."35 In macrocosm, this synthesis is represented by the chapel itself, a monumental Marian vas electionis,36 and, in microcosm, by the Virgin Mary, ruler of Rome, the new Ephesus, mistress of nature and the cosmos as both the Sun and the Moon, and protector of the faithful from pestilence. Like the Madonna del Soccorso enshrined in the Gregoriana, the Virgin of the Sixtine Chapel ensures the salvation of the just and the destruction of the Devil's minions.37 The Marian symbolism that informs the Salone Sistino emblem finds both foil and complement in the subscriptio of the impresa of S. Maria Maggiore, once located at the Villa Montalto (Fig. 21).38 This imago differs from those on the stairway vault and in the Salone Sistino in that it represents the Sixtine Chapel in tandem with the basilica and obelisk of S. Maria Maggiore, like another impresa of S. Maria Mag- giore in the Salone Sistino, to which I shall shortly refer. The subscriptio emphasizes the Christological, taking into account the larger context in which the Sixtine Chapel is in this case rendered: "NASCENTI CHRISTO PROPRIOS SOL CEDIT HONORES/CHRISTO VT DEFICIENS DEFICIENTE LATET" (The Sun yields to Christ, when born, his due honors, just as it hides and dies when Christ dies).39 The 29 On the Borgia apartments, see, recently, C.

F. Bordinus, De rebus praeclare gestis A Sisto V. Pon. Max. ..., Rome, 1588, 13, 16, sees the Sixtine Chapel in light of conquering "the dreadful foe who holds sway on earth and in hell."

This reference to the Nativity also suggests the birth of Felice Peretti in the "other" grotto of Grottamare, especially since Saint Lucy, the saint on whose feast day the pope was born, is given her own chapel within the Sixtina.42 The specific collocation of the Sun and Christ's birth, in turn, may apply to the comet that announced the Savior's 40 On the pope's natal chart, and all following references to the pope's biography, see Mandel, 1990, 18-23. 41 See, e.g., M.

This collocation also evokes the star that led the Magi to Bethlehem, and the star of the pope's coat-of-arms. Since the Sixtine Chapel is located at the center of the stellar street plan of Rome, a number of parallels may be forged, from the translation of the "long-haired" Peretti pope from his grotto to the city now emulating in plan the star of his heraldry; to the translation of the praesepio from its grotto in Jerusalem to its mountainous enclosure in Rome; and, drawing on the subscriptio of the Salone Sistino impresa of the Sixtine Chapel, the translation of the new Temple of Diana from the center of Ephesus to the center of Rome. The notion that the Sun hides when Christ falters refers to the eclipse of the Sun that occurred when the Savior was crucified. Since the Sixtine Chapel functions as both reliquary and burial chamber, then the allusions to Christ's death may serve also for those of his vicars. Additionally, such allusions relate to the obelisk that, following Christ's earthly demise, had been interred in the ground until "resuscitated" by Pope Sixtus V. Indeed, as the distych accompanying the impresa of S. Maria Maggiore in the Salone Sistino makes clear, the obelisk is as central to this symbolism of birth and death, and of the translation from the pagan to the Christian, as the Sixtine Chapel (Fig. 22): "QVI REGVM TVMVLIS OBELISCVS SERVIT OLIM/AD CVNAS CHRISTI TV PIE SIXTE LOCAS" (The obelisk that once ministered to the tombs of kings, you, pious Sixtus, place at the cradle of Christ).43 To complete the symbolism of the Epiphany and the Eucharist contained in the Villa Montalto distych, the crib of Christ and the remains of his vicars inversely relate to Sixtus V's mission to recapture the Holy Sepulchre from the Turks, and to translate it to Montalto, the town where Felice Peretti was schooled.44 The visual analogy of the staircase quadro to the triple Montalto moun- tains of the Sixtine heraldry is therefore borne out icono- graphically, by drawing on the programmatic connections forged during the Sixtine pontificate. Although the star that regularly surmounts the triple mountains is absent from the Sixtine Chapel (cf. Fig. 3), the star is understood to be present 43 Fontana, 84. 44 Fagiolo dell'Arco (as in n. 42), 24; and Fagiolo and Madonna (as in n. 42), 33-34.</page><page sequence="14">78 THE ART BULLETIN MARCH 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 1 21 S.

The triple mountains of the Sixtine Chapel may accordingly be seen as analogous to both the star and lion of the Sixtine stemma. Since the pendant narrative on the staircase vault contains an allegory featuring the triple mountains surmounted by the radiant lion, like the star above the mountains of the Sixtine heraldry, there is a connection between the import of the two quadri. The panegyrics written for the pope, especially those on the Sixtine Chapel, underline this reading. The integral addition of a pagan component to what is first and foremost a Christian impresa in the Sixtine Chapel of the Salone Sistino is echoed by Geronimo Badesio, who speaks of Diana as the moon goddess in the context of the chapel, while comparing the chapel itself to Olympus.45 Giuseppe Castiglione com- pares it to Parnassus;46 and Giovanni Francesco Bordino to the "intonsi montes," the Apollonian, or "crinitus"-like mountains of the pope's heraldry.47 If these sources are applied to a reading of the vault, the Sixtine Chapel may be likened to the Temple of Diana-Luna (cf. the Temple of the Ephesian Diana to which the Salone Sistino emblem refers); to the Temple of Jupiter, king of the gods on Olympus and husband of the Ephesian Diana when understood as Diana- Juno;48 and to the Temple of Apollo Musagetes, the "intonsus" and "crinitus" leader of the Muses. With this last connection in mind, the fully domed and otherwise splayed chapel rendered in a pastoral surround is assimilated to 45 H. Badesius, De Sacello Sixti V. Pont. Max.

Just as Sixtus V's chapel is compared to a pagan temple in the Salone Sistino impresa, the pagan narrative of Sixtus Vand the Muses may be read according to a contemporary, Chris- tian context. Such a reading is indicated by the presence of the pope in his leonine manifestation, and by the mountain- ous region on which he now stands. In one sense, the scene occurs in Rome, the seven-hilled city so often compared to the triple mountains of the Sixtine heraldry.50 In another, more specific way, it occurs on the Vatican hill, ruled in antiquity by Sol-Apollo, but now ruled by the Christian Sol-Apollo, Pope Sixtus V. In each case, the solar pope exercises his dominion over the respublica Christiana, signified by both the globe and the "keys of the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 16:19). The keys bestow the power to make actions on earth reverberate in Heaven, and they act in tandem with the Muses, traditionally associated with the harmonious and just workings of the universe,"5 and with the angel who places the tiara on the lion's head (cf. Fig. 9).

Ultimately, the harmony created on earth by Sixtus V simulates the harmony created by God in Heaven.53 My interpretation of the staircase vault is consonant with the method employed by Fra Felice Peretti, the future Pope Sixtus V, in his sermons, as he drew on medieval exegetical tradition in adopting the allegorical, moral, and anagogical interpretations of a single biblical passage. He gave to any given symbol a reading based on an extraordinarily wide range of significations, both pagan and Christian; and he viewed world history as continuous, from the ancient pagan past through the Christian present and eschatological fu- ture.54 My interpretation also finds sanction in Vasari's Ragionamenti, a secular text written for the visitor to the palace of Grand Duke Cosimo I de'Medici and the seat of Tuscan government, the Palazzo della Signoria.55 Composed as a dialogue between Vasari, the author of the majority of the frescoes in the palace, and the Grand Duke's son, Francesco, in which Francesco poses straightforward ques- tions that Vasari then answers, the Ragionamenti are, in fact, a veritable storehouse of rebuses, containing veiled clues by which the underlying layers of meaning inherent in the cycle may be unlocked by the erudite reader standing before the paintings. A reader not attuned to the often hermetic basis of Medicean art would, of course, take the explanations pro- vided by Vasari at face value and walk away from the program assuming to have understood the meaning; a reader attuned to the arcana, and well versed in Medicean history, would likewise leave the program satisfied, but with a far more profound understanding based on the kind of polysemous reading of any given image that I am suggesting be em- ployed for the cycle of the staircase vault. If the suggested reading of the program according to the pagan-imperial and Christian-papal may be taken as exemplary of the method employed throughout the program of the vault, and I believe it may, then it should be compared to the "superposition symbolism"56 of the Sixtine heraldry and cross atop the pagan obelisk. Although Christian and pagan subjects are equally represented in the cycle, the earthly, primarily pagan scenes on the cove should be read by superimposing a Christian meaning, while the heavenly, Christian scenes on the vault should be read by venturing beneath the surface to extract from the mountainous regions the pagan core on which the whole is supported. The pendant to the Szxtine Chapel (Fig. 7), as depicted again with slight variations in the Salone Sistino, was given a considerable amount of attention by Domenico Fontana, Mutio Pansa, and Rocca, the late cinquecento authors concerned with the library's frescoed program (Fig. 23). Referred to either as the Chastity or the Prohibition of Adulterers by these authors, the zmpresa illustrates the con- tents of a bull published by the pope on November 3, 1586, and reissued in the vernacular shortly thereafter, specifying the death penalty for adulterers.57 The subscriptio of the Salone Sistino emblem confirms the reference to contempo- rary events, and provides the viewer with a way to read the image: "VIRGO INTACTA MANET, NEC VIVIT ADVL- TERA CONIVX,/CASTAQVE NVNC ROMA EST, QVAE FVIT ANTE SALAX" (The virgin remains untouched, but the adulterous wife lives not, and Rome, which was once salacious, is now chaste).58 Two basic ideas emerge from the distych, namely the safekeeping of the morally pure and the expulsion of the morally blemished women (for the men are but victims of ones so wily, as Pansa intimates).59 These ideas are complemented by the personifications of Chastity and Defense (or Prosecution) flanking the zmpresa of the Prohzbi- tion in the Salone Sistino.60 They account, too, for the two titles given the impresa in the cinquecento. When entitled the Chastity, the emphasis is being placed on the central moun- 52 G. B. Ladner, "Vegetation Symbolism and the Concept of Renais- sance," De artibus opuscula XL.

When called the Prohibition ofAdulterers, attention is being directed to the boars, traditional symbols of lust.61 In the first instance, the triple mountains of Montalto are rendered in white-egg white as Rocca specifies-in order to symbolize purity and chastity.62 The three crowns enclosing the moun- tains are taken from the papal tiara and transform Montalto into the hilled city of Rome in general, and the Vatican hill, or citta leonina in particular. They give to the pope the triple power of prince, judge, and priest; the power of the two swords, and the power to bind and loose, hence the "keys of the kingdom of heaven" held in his forepaw in the staircase quadro.63 The inhabitants of chaste Rome are identified by the cinquecento authors as follows: the women wearing white on the upper tier are virgins; those garbed in black on the middle tier are widows; and the gaily dressed men and women on the lower tier are married couples.64 As marital separation was punishable by death, according to the dic- tates of Sixtus V's bull, the couples are prudently yoked together in obedience.65 In the second instance, when the impresa is entitled the Prohibition, the boars, who lost their yokes long ago, are being let loose by the lion and his key of excommunication.66 Much as it happened in Rome following the issuance of the bull, when adulterers were whipped in public and fined if they had not managed to escape punish- ment by fleeing the city,67 the boars as astute lechers make a hasty retreat. As a solar entity, the lion of the staircase Prohibition is readily assimilated to the sun god Apollo: the lion acts as an Apollo Nomius in safeguarding the virgins, widows, and married couples of his flock, and as an Apollo Medicus in ridding the triple mountains of the salacious boars. Stated differently, the lion resembles the Delian Apollo, god of health and pestilence, and analogue to the Christ child of the Sixtine Chapel. He also resembles the Ephesian Diana, god- dess likewise of health and pestilence, and analogue to the Virgin of the Sixtine Chapel. As a lion in possession of two keys, he clearly relates to the lions of the cove narratives. When represented with the Muses, the Sixtine lion is oversee- ing the harmonious and just working of the respublica Christiana, both in the temporal and spiritual spheres, as indicated, among other emblems, by the regal crown, cardi- nal's hat, and papal tiara, and the sword, crozier, and scepter suspended from the tree. As such, the beneficent lion of Sixtus V and the Muses is like the lion of the Prohibition who 61 Taja (as in n. 2), 446, was the first actually to refer to the animals, and he calls them "porci." Compare G. P. Chattard, Nuova descrizione del Vaticano o sia del Palazzo Apostolico di San Pietro . . ., 3 vols., Rome, 1767, III, 21, for example. Valeriano, chap. ix, characterizes boars as symbolic of "luxuriosae deliciae," and "salacitas"; P. Berchorius [P. Bersuire], Dictionarii ser. repertorii moralis, II, Venice, 1589, 435, describes the boar as a symbol of luxury. Also consult F. Cameron Siller and R. M. Meyler, The Symbolic Pig.

Papa Sisto Quinto . . ., Urbino, 1587, 48, refers to "adulteri porchi" as part of his list of the unjust during the Sixtine pontificate, indicating that the connection between pigs and adulterers was common knowledge. 62 Rocca, 28, refers to "alborum Montium." 63 Ibid., 28. 64 Pansa, 78, mentions the women and girls, but omits the husbands altogether; both Fontana, 85, and Rocca, 28, mention the virgins, widows, and married couples. 65 Rocca, 28, notes that the couples are yoked together. Pansa, 283, mentions the yoke as a symbol of matrimonial faith and servitude in the context of Cecrops, the androgenous ruler of Thebes, represented in the Salone Sistino. 66 This reading is confirmed by Defensio, holding a thunderbolt, located beside the impresa in the Salone Sistino. 67 Von Pastor (as in n. 57), 93-94.

He is also Apollonian in this context because traditionally Diana does not accompany the Muses. When represented with satyrs, satyresses, and nymphs, the lion should reasonably be acting vigilantly, expulsing the counterparts to the disease-infested adulterers. Since the lion in Sixtus V and the Muses acts like another Apollo, then the lion of Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs should act as another Diana. The nymphs in Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs hold objects in their outstretched arms that look like lilies. Since the nymphs are near water, the lilies may well be water lilies, or nen- uphars, the "herb" traditionally associated with water nymphs.68 If this is indeed the case, then the nymphs may be identified as hydryads or, even more specifically, as dryads, marsh nymphs, or nyads, given the river that forks around their plot of land. Whatever their true identity, as chaste beings these nymphs would not appear to merit the lion's wrath. The satyrs, conversely, are extremely libidinous crea- tures. The males of the species were believed to have perpetually palpitating genitalia, and the women to be equally prone to randiness.69 They are the counterparts to the adulterous boars of the Prohibition and naturally deserve any punishment the lion chooses to mete out. Much as Sixtus V and the Muses is to be read in a contem- porary light, whereby the pope becomes an alter Apollo ruling the Vatican hill, I would suggest that Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs represents an event as relevant to the Sixtine pontifi- cate as to the ancient history of Rome. My reading finds sanction in the Parnassus of the Stanza della Segnatura, which is taken out of the realm of mythology and situated in world history through the addition of such figures as Sappho, identified by the scroll inscribed with her name, and Homer, Virgil, and Dante. In this way, the Parnassus properly responds to the histories of the School of Athens, the Dzsputd, Emperor Justinian Handing the Pandects to Trebonianus, and Pope Gregory IX Handing the Decretals to Saint Razmund of Peiaforte. My method of analysis is also used by the mythog- rapher Natale Comes, who distinguishes between the mytho- logical and the historical in his explication of antique "fables," including those concerning satyrs and nymphs.70 My hypothesis may be tested by consideration of the Parcae, located on the same, western side of the vault as Szxtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs, as well as the pendant Sixtus V Crowning Himself As presiders over births and sage manipulators of the future, the Parcae herald Felice Peretti, the "wonder child" by all accounts provided during the Sixtine pontifi- cate, born, like the Savior, in a grotto. As presiders over weddings, the Parcae proclaim the union between the Church and the newly elected Pope Sixtus V, destined, like the consul Stilicho, to bring about a return of the Golden Age; they foresee the accession of "Crinitus" to the see of Peter and, by their devising, ensure that he will place the papal tiara on his head on the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, April 24, 1585, a Wednesday, Felice's "lucky" Mercurial day.7 Celebra- tions of the birthday of Rome, like the election of Sixtus V, are described by Ovid in Book Iv of the Fasti, the source so essential for an understanding of the finer points of Sixtine iconology. Called the Parilia, or Palilia, the festivities honor Pales, the goddess of shepherds. They take place in the countryside and essentially utilize fire and water: materials taken from the Virgin Vesta's altar are fumigated, and the ground is purified with water. Like all ancient rites, actions are complemented by words. The shepherds invoke the "sylvan Pales" with a lengthy prayer, including the following: Ward off from my stalls all harm, O let it flee away!. .. If I have entered a forbidden grove, or the nymphs and the half-goat god have been put to flight at sight of me ..., pardon my fault. Count it not against me if I have sheltered my flock in a rustic shrine till the hail left off, and may I not suffer for having troubled the pools: forgive it, nymphs, if the trampling of hoofs has made your waters turbid. Do thou, goddess, appease for us the springs and their divinities; appease the gods dispersed through every grove. May we not see the Dryads, nor Diana's baths, nor Faunus [Pan], when he lies in the fields at noon. Drive far away diseases.72 As Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs demonstrates, the "nymphs and the half-goat god," as well as his female followers, are indeed being "put to flight"; the water issuing from the "rustic shrine" to the left of the quadro is indeed "turbid"; and the infected satyrs, satyresses, and even nymphs are being driven "far away." Like the porcine adulterers of the Prohibition, they are being vanquished by the leonine Sixtus V-Pales.73 It happens that Pales, like Diana, was often spoken of in the same breath as Apollo, particularly by Virgil, bard of the Augustan Golden Age.74 The vigilant leonine Pales accordingly resembles both the lion of the Prohibition, who expulses diseased adulterers, and the Virgin of the Sixtine 68 Comes, chaps. v, xIIi. 69 On satyrs, see Comes, chaps. v, vIII; Valeriano, chap. x; Cartari, 138-142; Pansa, 283.

When under- stood as a representation of the Parilia, then, Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs functions as a proper, obverse pendant to Sixtus V and the Muses; the vigilant and just natures of the pope's good government are conveyed individually on the coves, as collectively on the vault. Having determined that the quadro represents the Parilia, an observer cognizant of the biography of the newly elected pope would immediately recall key events concerning fire, pestilence, and water: the spark of the lamp that left the cradled Felice enveloped in flames, but still smiling when his mother came to extinguish the fire; the plague that left the youth miraculously unscathed, despite his having touched his brother's infected clothing; and the creek into which the nonswimming boy fell, happily to be saved by his sister. With the leonine Sixtus V-Diana-Pales now understood as a histor- ical figure of the papal-imperial present, as of the pagan and Christian past, it follows that her twin brother Apollo, already understood as a figure of the papal-imperial present, as of the pagan past in Sixtus V and the Muses, should likewise accommodate himself to a reading based on the early life of the pope. Compared to "the Sun in the middle of the planets" at birth, Apollo-Sixtus V is the Sun, and the Muses are the planets with which they are traditionally connected, as well as the Liberal Arts in which the extremely learned Fra Felice was so well versed.75 The symbols of secular and religious power suspended from the Peretti tree suggest the peace heralded by Sixtus V's birth. Finally, the angel crown- ing the Apollonian lion may be compared to the friars at the convent in Montalto, who made the precocious Felice a Franciscan friar at age thirteen (cf. Figs. 15-16). The accretion of meaning inherent in the triple mountains and lion (as well as the star) that the foregoing analysis has uncovered is integral to the typology of the pope's early life and pontificate. The armorial bearings relate fundamentally to the biography of Felice Peretti and, in forming the basis for the action represented in the stairway vault, the pontifi- cate of Sixtus V.76 Additionally, as the message of the vault conveys, they are the means by which the pope has created on earth a simulacrum of the Heavenly Jerusalem, having expulsed the morally impure and harbored the morally just. As the analysis of the vault has revealed, and as an examina- tion of the imprese of Sixtine Rome reinforces, Sixtus V has achieved his mandate owing to his double nature as the Sun and the Moon."77 Simply stated, the Sixtine lion may be said to embody the day Rome was founded (like the day Sixtus V was elected), because on this day the Sun and the Moon were in conjunction.78 The implication of this conjunction is that the four quadri of the stairway vault contain reference to the Parilia in honor of Pales-Diana-the-Virgin-Mary, and the election of Pope Sixtus V, and that such reference is astrolog- ical in nature. In keeping with the nature of the Parcae as presiders over weddings and births, and the ease with which events in the pope's pontificate are analogized to those in his early life, there should be reference to his birth as well. Such notions may be borne out by considering the Extirpa- tion of the Bandits (Fig. 24, cf. Figs. 17-19), one of the premier imprese of Sixtine Rome, because in both form and content it is like the Prohibition: the lion wielding a thunderbolt in the Extirpation corresponds to the lion with keys in the stairway Prohibition; the triple mountains of Rome, Olympus, Parnas- sus, Grottamare, and Montalto (to name the essential ones) are constants; the lambs correspond to the virgins, widows, and married couples of the pope's flock; and the wolves, symbols of robbers and prostitutes, relate to the adulterous boars.79 A reading based on Ovid's Fasti and the Sun's course through Taurus in Book Iv, the source and chapter so essential to an identification of the action in Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs, as well as the Sun's course through Aquarius in Book II, reveals that the Extirpation represents both the Parilia, or election of Sixtus V, and the story of Diana and the hamadryad Callisto, or the birth of Felice Peretti.80 In essence, according to Book rv, the lion corresponds to Jupiter (thunderbolt) conjunct the Sun (lion) in Taurus on the pope's electoral chart (Fig. 25); the twin constellation of Gemini, the pope's electoral Ascendant (hereafter ASC) and guardian of Rome; and Mercury, lord of the ASC and envoy of justice. Like the boars of the Prohibition, the wolverine robbers of the Extirpation are "drive[n] far away" by the Jovean and Palilian lion so that the chaste sheep, like the chaste virgins, widows, and married couples, may live safely in the cittda leonina, as in the respublica Christiana. According to Book II of the Fasti, the lion of the Extirpation corresponds to Jupiter (thunderbolt) conjunct the Sun in Capricorn ("starry Leo"), as well as Saturn, lord of the pope's natal chart, in his other domicile of Aquarius (Fig. 26). The lion also corre- sponds to the chaste moon-goddess Diana, who banished Callisto and her son Arcas, symbolized by the wolves, because of the hamadryad's liaison with Jupiter while on one of his numerous adulterous escapades. The wolverine Callisto and Arcas, understood as the prostitutes infesting Rome, are accordingly "drive[n] far away" by the lunar lion, who also creates a safe mountainous haven for the chaste sheep, like the chaste virgins, widows, and married couples. Jupiter ultimately takes pity on Callisto and Arcas, who were trans- formed into bears by his justly outraged wife Juno (the lion with thunderbolt in this sense), and catasterized mother and son into the extra-zodiacal constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, understood in Christian lore as the Virgin and Child. As the polar star of Ursa Minor was actually conjunct 75 On the connection, see Ettlinger (as in n. 49), 29-35. 76 Compare Pope Leo X, who fancied himself another lion of the tribe of Judah, Sol-Apollo, Augustus, and harbinger of a renewed Golden Age, providentially chosen and astrologically predestined to rule the respub- lzca Chrzstzana from the czttd leonzna, the city with which he shared his name, the headquarters of Christianity, and site of Rome's first founda- tion with Romulus and Remus when the Sun was in Libra. He would choose, among others, the yoke device of the founder of the Medicean dynasty, Cosimo il Vecchio, with or without the anzma taken from Matthew 11: 30, in order to encapsulate the many facets of his being.

Rousseau, "The Yoke Impresa of Leo X," Mzttezlungen des Kunsthzstortschen Institutes zn Florenz, xxxIIl, 1989, 113-126. 77 On the inherently male-solar and female-lunar natures of the Sixtine lion in the zmprese, consult Mandel, 1990, 25. 78 Plutarch, Lzfe of Romulus, xii, 2, in Plutarch's Lives, trans.

Indeed, were it not for the porcine adulterers and wolverine prostitutes and bandits, the Golden Age of the Sixtine pontificate and the birth of the "wonder child" would not have been possible.83 Felix culpa is indispensable for the realization of Felix Roma.84 The battle of opposites and their ultimate synthesis, which informs both the general layout of the vault, with "battling" 81 The twin mounts of Gemini (the two mountains supporting the third, or Hercules the Kneeler) and the star (or sometimes two stars) of the Sixtine stemma look remarkably like the felt caps of the Dioscuri, especially as depicted on antique coins. These caps symbolize Leda's eggs; see L. Olschki, The Myth of Felt, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1949, 44-46. There would seem to be a connection, then, between the "alborum Montium" of the Prohibition and Mercury as ruler of the Dioscuri-Gemini on Sixtus V's electoral chart. 82 The Extirpation is represented in the Vatican Palace, the Lateran Palace, and Villa Montalto, whereas the Prohibition appears solely at the Vatican. The astrological nuances are plentiful once hermetic entree into the Prohibition has been provided. Ovid, Iv, 291-348, for example, refers to many of the elements contained in the quadro in telling the story of the arrival of the Mother Goddess, the Roman Diana of Ephesus, to Rome when the Sun is in Taurus. In this regard, it is provocative to consider a suggestion kindly offered by Ann Kuttner, that Diana of Ephesus's "breasts" may be understood as eggs. Although I have been unable to find evidence of such a reading during the Renaissance, Diana of Ephesus was compared to a herm, and hence to Mercury, during this time; see H. Thiersch, Artemis Ephesia. Eine archdologische Untersuchung, Berlin, 1935, 101-103. 83 The exorcism of impure demons from the obelisks and columns also responds to the extirpation of wolverine bandits and prostitutes and porcine adulterers from Rome and the respublica Christiana, and is as fundamental to the meaning of the Sixtine pontificate; see Mandel (as in n. 7). Not incidentally, the impresa of the Prohibition in the Salone Sistino is located in the Piazza del Popolo, with the mountains standing on the spot occupied by the obelisk. I have been unable to identify either the watery landscape to the left of the crowned mountains in the Prohibition of the stairway, or the structures to the right; tempting as it may be to assign a location relative to the obelisk of the Vatican or the Esquiline, the evidence is not sufficiently clear to warrant such a reading. 84 Ambrose, Sermo 45, De primo Adam et secundo, in Pat. lat. xvII, 715, cited and discussed in A. Boczkowska, "The Crab, the Sun, the Moon and Venus: Studies in the Iconology of Hieronymus Bosch's Triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights," Oud Holland, xci, 4, 1977, 215. Sixtus V was unquestionably aware of this tenet, because he was working on an edition of Ambrose while in retirement during the pontificate of Gregory XIII. Given the connection with his name, the tenet no doubt would have seemed particularly "felicitous" to him.</page><page sequence="21">THE PROGRAM OF THE SIXTINE STAIRCASE 85 Latitudinis.r So o aI 4 iI S.

Michelson of Astro Computing Services cove quadri and "synthetic" quadri riportati, and its individual components, like the battling lion and boars of the Prohibi- tion,85 is central to that branch of the hermetica known as alchemy. The repetitive nature of the pope's life, as mani- fested formally and symbolically in the program, especially through the syncretism inherent in the elements of the Sixtine stemma, is comparable to the alchemical process, whereby any given operation must be executed more than once to be successful.86 So, too, the elements of the Sixtine heraldry used to enact the narratives are symbols tradition- ally associated with alchemy. The mountains, particularly the egg-shaped and egg-white mountains of the Prohibition, may be read as both the alchemist's flask or furnace in which the work is carried out, also called the grotto or cave, and the Philosopher's Stone, Quintessence, or Egg signifying the end of the work.87 The lion is a traditional symbol of the transmuting agent in the alchemical process, which begins with the green lion, analogue to the entombed king and dead Christ, and ends with the red lion, young king, or resurrected Christ who lives in the air.88 The alchemical opus must be created according to the stars, so as properly to create a microcosm on earth of the macrocosm in Heaven, like the Church Militant created by Sixtus V in emulation of the Church Triumphant. As the "starry Leo," the natal Sun sign of the pope in Capricorn, as well as the Sun in his domicile of Leo (the cittd leonina), the zodiacal lion-pope signifies both the beginning of the alchem- ical process, which must be initiated during the winter, before the Sun leaves the sign of Capricorn, and the intermediary stage which leads to the end of the alchemical work, and the attainment of salvation, whereby the Philoso- pher's Stone is hardened in the extremely hot fire of the summer Sun.89 That this lion is at once Sol-Apollo and Luna-Diana points to the characterization of the Philoso- pher's Stone in the Tabula Smaragdina, the Bible of the alchemists: "Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon. The 8 Just as the overall organization of the vault is mirrored in its parts, it may well be that in the Prohibition a similar situation is at work. The married couples, who are yoked together, for example, may symbolize a conjunction of opposites in keeping with the Sixtine lion-cum-Apollo-Sol and Diana-Luna, since iugum traditionally indicates coniunctio. On this relationship, consult R. Taylor, "Architecture and Magic. Consider- ations on the Idea of the Escorial," in Essays in the History of Architecture Presented to Rudolph Wittkower, ed. D. Fraser, H. Hibbard, and M. J. Lewine, London, 1967, 101. 86 For the alchemical process, consult W. Shumaker, The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance.

This may or may not have been a matter of decorum. It seems to me that the distinctively egg-like mountains were repre- sented in this fashion to point one versed in the "occult doctrine" in the alchemical direction. It was not unusual for the Sixtine mountains to take on unusual and telling guises, as indicated by Bordini's "intonsi montes," discussed in the text above. 88 DeJong, 123, 244-245. 89 Ibid., 132-133.</page><page sequence="22">86 THE ART BULLETIN MARCH 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER I --C~eer=z~::: -?ce --~---_~~-: C 5.- c; rr- ; ....,, :T~BRE b(~;r I) s-- ?, ---I--I;--I-? ?--r- ?II ; - I-- + --- ~ha: 1) i~0~t~bgs, 6~ B~I: ?- --- - ~i~" ~::;:- -"- :I: r(; ::?~f~~ -?~1 14~ :----- --i--, r ;-51cCrR-7"75apU;jrr=;~'--L~r; c~ ~ L~CRCP5;Frr;4--? c:IL~~ ~ic~--a ----?--=- -, 27 Michael Maier, Atalanta fugiens, emblema xxVII (from M.

As the aerial lion and embodiment of Rome's creation, moreover, the "Quinta essenza," Sisto Quinto would seem to "separate earth from fire, the subtle from the gross, in a smooth way, with great sagacity," emulating "the way the world was created"; he would seem to "possess the glory of the whole world, and all obscurity ... flees from [him]." Since the triple mountains of the Prohibi- tion and the Sixtine Chapel, as indeed of Sixtus Vand the Muses and Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs, are like the lion as well as the star that regularly surmounts them in the Sixtine heraldry, devices, and obelisks,92 this indicates one of the most fundamental tenets of the alchemist's art: "That which is below is like to that which is above, And that which is above is like to that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing."

Sixtus V and the Muses and Sixtus V, Satyrs, and Nymphs, would not just be the keys given to Peter and his successors by Christ, they would be the key(s) offered by Christ-Mercurius to the practitioner; the keys owned by those chosen few, like Moses and Hermes Trismegistos, who are given the means to unlock the secrets of the universe, and to ascend Parnassus, solar hill and home of Apollo and the Muses (Fig. 27).93 Consideration of the three fundamental stages of the alchemical process known to the adept, and indicated in true hermetic fashion in the program of the stairway vault through its emphasis on fire, disease, and water, serves further to elucidate the alchemical symbolism lurking be- neath the mountainous vault, and the resultant cavern in which the spectator stands. Fire is required to heat the alchemical "mountain" containing Sol (sulphur) and Luna (mercury), each in possession of a key (Fig. 28), and trans- lated in the quadri of the stairway program as Apollo- Mercury of Sixtus Vand the Muses and Diana-Pales of Sixtus V, 90 See De Jong, 59, for this and the following references to Hermes Trismegistos, Tabula Smaragdina. On the thrice-great one, see Rocca, 99-104; and Pansa, 3. 91 "DISIVNCTAS SIXTVS DVM IVNGIT FOEDERE GENTES,/ET DICTIS MVLCET PECTORA DVRA PIIS,/IVSSA DEI AVT PERFERT, ANIMAS AVT EVOCAT ORCO,/MERCVRIVS VERVS DICI ANNE POTEST?" (While Sixtus joins divided peoples by treaty and softens cruel hearts with pious words, he either conveys the commands of God or summons souls from Hades, can he be called the true Mercury?) 92 Quattrami (as in n. 87), 161, evocatively, for our purposes, compares the "stella cometa 6 crinita" (triple mountains and star, or lion) to the "capra saltante" (satyrs and satyresses?) and "dracone volante" (boars and bears?) of the alchemists. 93 A "cryptic" reference to Hermes Trismegistos exists in a device at both the Villa Montalto and Lateran Palace with corpo composed of the triple mountains and star, and the following anima: "LVX ORTA EST IVSTO TPY[Y]MEFIETOY" (The light, thrice-great one, is risen to the just), representing a paraphrase of Psalm 96: 11.</page><page sequence="23">THE PROGRAM OF THE SIXTINE STAIRCASE 87 29 Salomon Trismosin, Splendor solis, 1582.

Sol and Luna then couple, or enter into a conjunction, like Diana-Pales-Apollo-Mercury of the Prohibi- tion, and the Madonna-Diana and Child-Apollo-Mercury understood to be present in the grotto of the mountain of the Sixtine Chapel. Fire is similarly needed to separate the wedded Sol-Luna following this stage of coniunctio, and, in fact, it plays a vital role throughout the alchemical process. Fire also symbolizes the Sun of Philosophy, the igneous Apollo, and the end product of the work: the lion present in the Prohibition, and understood in the Sixtine Chapel.94 94 On the Sun of Philosophy, consult De Jong, 234-238; and Dixon, 15-16. Significantly, the Sun of Philosophy is said to have been born under a lucky star, as was Sixtus V: Arcturus was conjunct his natal MC (Mid-Heaven) in Scorpio, and Polaris, his electoral ASC in Gemini. In this context, the lion with globe and keys in Sixtus V and the Muses might be identified as Philosophy, following L. D. Ettlinger, "Pollaiuolo's Tomb of Pope Sixtus IV,"Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, xvI, 1953, 263, who equates Apollo with Philosophia and Diana with Theologia with regard to the tomb of Sixtus IV, Sixtus V's namesake, in the basilica of St. Peter's.</page><page sequence="24">88 THE ART BULLETIN MARCH 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER ] . .. .. . .....

Fraenger, Hieronymus Bosch (1st ed. 1975), New York, 1983, 155, explains that the boar's propensity to eat its young makes it a Saturnine symbol, since Saturn is known for having eaten his children.

The lords of the pope's natal and electoral charts, as actually contained in the lion of the Prohibition when read astrologically, therefore oversee this vile and odiferous stage. Further, in Trismosin's allegory, bellows and a phial are used by the Mercurial boy who must battle the dragon; it is probably no coincidence that the herdsman in the Salone Sistino imago of the Prohibition subjects the renegade boar, now safely enclosed within the grotto or "mountain" in the right foreground, to the effects of his bellows (cf. Figs. 29 and 23).97 That the flask in Trismosin's rendition of the putrefactio is surrounded by a wreath, finally, may well help to explain the crowns that 97 In this way, they echo the farmer and his wife to the right of Trismosin's allegorical putrefactio. For this and the following references to S. Trismosin, Splendor solis, 1582, British Library, Harleian Ms 3469, I am following the interpretations in J. Fabricius, Alchemy. The Medieval Alchemists and Their Royal Art (1st ed. 1976), rev. ed., Northamptonshire, 1989, 114, 135, 240-243. The alchemical symbolism of the Salone Sistino Prohibition is enhanced by the fact that the triple mountains stand on the spot occupied by the obelisk of S. Maria del Popolo, and the obelisk may be read alchemically as the Philosopher's Stone; see Mandel (as in n. 7).</page><page sequence="26">90 THE ART BULLETIN MARCH 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 1 enclose the egg-shaped mountains of the Prohibition, as well as the numerous wreaths and crowns given to the "adept" lion in the program of the stairway vault. In order to combat the Saturnine ingredient, and achieve the cibatio or albedo stage, ruled variously by Jupiter and Diana, water must be administered to the contents of the vessel. To aid the process, the Liberal Arts must be pursued in order to combat the "salacious" Saturnine putrefactio (Fig. 30).98 As the leader of the Muses (Fig. 4), Sixtus V, like Alexander VI in the Borgia Apartments and Julius II in the Stanza della Segnatura, therefore possesses the means to combat heresy.99 Accordingly, he may direct the chaste inhabitants of the mountainous enclave of the Prohibition, like the pilgrims praying within the mountain of the Sixtine Chapel, on their quest for salvation. Following the introduction of water, the ingredients in the alchemist's vessel are reborn, like the resurrected Christ, to become the solar, golden Philosopher's Stone. This final stage of the alchemical process is known as the rubedo. It enables Sol to be enveloped by the lunar fire (Fig. 31), like the lion of the Prohibition, so that he may begin his final transmutation into the hardened stone, while fishermen and hunters, echoing those on the stairway vault, apparently ensure that inimical forces, like the boars, satyrs, satyresses, and nymphs, be forever kept at bay. Like the three crowns of the Prohibition, which commonly symbolize iron, silver, and gold in alchemical symbolism,100 base matter is transformed into gold, the green lion turns red, and the entombed Christ is resurrected to offer salvation to his followers-the virgins, widows, and married couples of the Prohibition, and the worshippers within the Sixtine Chapel. The Church Militant, in short, becomes one with the Church Triumphant. Indeed, as the epithalamium of the stairway vault relates, the "quintes- sential" Sixtus V was well equipped to offer salvation to Christ's flock, for he had been born in the grotto of the alchemist's flask, destined to transmute Felix culpa into Felix Roma.
