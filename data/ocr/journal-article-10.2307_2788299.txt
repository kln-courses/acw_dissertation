Joyce, M.A. in Vol. XXXV of The Journal of the Anthropological Institufe the auithors published a paper otn the Ba-Mbala, in which it was stated that this people were immigranits from the south, who had changed their abode uinder pressure, and lhad split up in the process. Since the publication of this paper, investigations lhave beeni made among the otlher branch of this people, situated to the south of that previously described, and, since the former differ from the latter considerably in certain respects, it will be as well to supplement the paper in the Journal, which deals with the Nortlhern Ba-Mbala, by a few notes on the Southern Ba-Mbala. The Southern Ba-Mbala extend from the middle Kwengo eastward across the Yambesi and Jari, tributaries of the first, to the Kwilu ; this last river tbe_y )ave also crossed, since a small colony is found on the right bank. Near the sources of the Luano their continuity is broken by a strip of territory occupied by Ba- Kwese. Their neighbours to the north and west are the Ba-Pindi, who separate them from the Ba-Yaka; on the east are the Ba-Kwese and Ba-Bunda; on the south-west the Ba-Lua. The presence of the last-named people is interesting: in the paper on the Northern Ba-Mbala, to which reference has been made above, a local tradition was mentioned accordinig to which it was stated that tlhe northward movement of the Ba- Mbala had been caused by pressure exercised by a people called Molua or Milua. It seems certain that the latter are to be identified with these Ba-Lua, .1iid the conjecture of Ankermann is thlus verified.* These Ba-Lua, who appear to be Ba-Lunda, observe a peculiar tabu, in accordance with which they are Uii- willing, to pronounice the niame of their tribe ; if pressed on the suibject they will call somiie foreignier to give the reqtiired information. Their southern neighbours are the Ba-Djoke, called iii the south Kioko, with whom they are continuiallv at feid ; in fact it was unider pressure exercised by the latter that they ocecupied the Kwengo anid displaced the Ba-Mbala as mentioned above. Their hatred of their hereditary foes is so great tlhat, if the niame " Ba-Djoke" is pronounced in the presence of a nuimber of Ba-Lua, eaclh milani iiimmediately expectorates violeiltly. The Southerni Ba-Mbala are a comparati-ely tall people, aiid though sleniderly bulilt are very wiry, and in powers of enduirance equial tlle Ba-Konlcgo. They are exceptionially hospitable and well-disposed to strangers. Circumicisioni is genieral anid is practise(l on boys before they are a year old. The hair oni the chiest is remioved except by ol0( lcli and chliefs. No tattooino or cicatirizationi is foutnd(l. FI. I .-METHOD F. HAP-RSIG (F-oi aa photg. lh * Zentralblatt f.

As regards applied ornament they paint the whole body and every article of wear with red pigment: the native word for this colour is babala, alnd, since the name of the tribe is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, it seems very likely that the word Ba-Mbala is a contraction of Ba-Babala, "red people." Any gift which may be presented to the traveller, be it an egg, a fowl or a goat, is coloured red, and if white cloth is given them, they at once proceed to stain it their favourite hue. The hair is worn in five longitudinal ridges, the interspaces between which are shaved. These ridges are never cut, and are usually braided, uniting in a single pigtail at the back. Across the forehead and over the ears runs a band of false hair (Fig. 1). I1i is a peculiar fact that many of the anthropomorphic carvings of the Northern Ba-Mbala exhibit the form of hair-dressing peculiar to the southern tribe. The ornamentation of his person is the chief occupation of the Southern Mo-Mbala when at home, his paint is renewed twice or thrice a day, and his face ornamented with stripes of red, brown, orange, and violet; the pattern is usually as follows:- a horizontal stripe on the forehead, a stripe from each ear to the tip of the nose, and again from each ear to the point of the chin. Personal beauty is an attribute which is highly valued; it is considered a compliment to speak of a guest as young and handsome, and even war has been known to result when one chief has boasted that his appearailce was superior to that of another. Hats are rare, but are worn in war-time; they are made of network with a brim, and are ornamented with red parrot-feathers. The waist-cloth is similar to that of the northern tribe, and is fringed in front. Bracelets are worn by all free men, and if a master presents one of his slaves with a bracelet it is a sign that he sets him free. Chiefs wear thirty or forty bracelets of imported brass or native iron on each arm, and a similar number of alnklets on each leg. On the upper arm is worn a tight circlet of string with a tassel, in. which is often stuck a small knife. Sandals of pussu are worn in hunting, when the grass has been freshly burnt, to protect the feet. Perhaps the most striking difference between the northern and southern tribe is that the latter do not eat human flesh; it seems most likely that the northern tribe have adopted this habit from the Ba-Huana and Ba-Yanzi, with whom the southern tribe have not come in contact to any extent. It seems unlikely that a people who have acquired a taste for human flesh should have abandoned cannibalism; moreover, it is a fact that some of the Bakwa-Mosinga tribe of the Ba-Kwese have, within the last ten years or so, become cannibals owing to association with the Ba-Pindi. Dogs are not eaten by the southern tribe. The huits are the same pattern as in the north, but those of chiefs are muclh larger; those of important chiefs are often from ten to fifteen metres long. The working and smelting of iron has been learnt, according to the native account, from the Ba-Songo. The building in which the smelting is practised is built of palm leaves, on a rectangular ground-plan, with a pointed-oval roof; at one end is a small door about 1 metre high by 50 cent-metres wide. A fetish is hung from the centre of the roof. Iron ore is common throughout the country; the furnace is of clay and rectangular, withouit a roof; at each corner is a pair of bellows similar to those in use amonig the Northern Ba-Mbala. At one side is dug a reservoir for the metal, which flows through an opening in one of the walls. The ore is powdered and placed in the furnace, and charcoal is placed on the top. The slag is broken up and mixed with the clay from which pots are made. The metal is worked by forging only, casting is unknown. There is a furnace in every village, and the chief is the ironmaster.

As in the north, each village, for the most part, is ruled by an inidepentdenit petty chief ; in some cases, however, there is a paramouLnlt chief for several villages. The latter state of affairs is probably due to a longy alliance inl war. The peculiar class of Muri, described in the paper oni the Northern Ba-Mbala qutoted above, and concerning which a few supplementary details were giveni at the end of a subsequent paper on the Ba-Yaka,* are found here also. They are distinguished by the same type of bracelet, the mwena, anid the same headeloth, yepi, which, however, in the south is worn only at milonga (palavers). To each mwena-bracelet is attached a particular name, which is assumed by the wearer; he does not, however, discard his former name, but may be called by either. These mwena-names, which have become obsolete in the north, are exactly paralleled by the titles, derived from estates, which are assumed by the her editary nobility of England. The peculiar custom, in accordance with which, in the north, the successor to the mwena must steal his predecessor's skuill, is not fcund in the south ; the followinig suggestion may explain this fact. The Ba-Yanzi are recognised as the suzerains of the territory which the Northern Ba-Mbala have acquired by purchase from them; anid in recognition of this fact they have a right to the skulls of all people killed in war among the northern tribe (perhaps eveni to the whole body in the days before the Ba-Mbala adopted cannibalism). These skulls, together with those of their own people and their enemies, the Ba-Yanzi chiefs keep all together in a separate little hut, a sort of museumn, and refuLse to part with them on any conditions. This fact very probably led to the stealing of the sktull of the deceased muri in the north. A newly-purchased slave must give all his earnings to his master, but after a year or so he is allowed to keep them for himself; possibly by this time he is coin- sidered to have refunded the price originally paid for him by his master. Wheii a married woman perceives thlat she is pregnant, she must confess all her former lovers to her husband; if she forgets the name of a single one it is believed that the child will die. Those with whom she has had intercourse before slhe was married (i.e., was taken to the house of her husband) pay a nominal fine of one or two djimbu to the husband; but those with whom sho has had relations after marriage must pay a heavy sum of from 5,000 to 10,000. Once'the wife is pregnant conjugal fidelity is necessary for both parties, otherwise the child will die, aild deaths of children are usually attribuited to this cauise. If the child dies the parents must undergo a purificatory rite. Clothed in a new kimpussu (palm-cloth skirt), they go to a river accompanied by an old woman, usually the sister or aiint of the wife, who dips them tlhrice in the water. In return for this service she receives the two kimpussu, worn by the errino couple. The Southern Ba-Mbala use the same mtusical instruments as the nortlherni, awnd their songs are the same, btit they are better musicians. A particularly initeresting fact is that the crossbow is known amongf the Southerli Ba-Mbala, not as a weapon, but ns a toy used only by children for shooting seeds O 5 10 FIG. 2.1 -T CROSS-BOW.

The stock is made from a palm-leaf rib, with the natural groove uppermost. In the specimen collected (Fig. 2) and in several others observed, the shape of the stock imitates a gun, and a hole has been made in the "muzzle " end to imitate the bore of a gunbarrel. The method of release is ingeniious: two pegs, in this case European nails, are fixed in the stock where the hammers occur in a gun, the front peg is immovable, the other is allowed a certain amount of play backwards and forwards; to the centre of the bowstring is fixed a short piece of wood, the bow is drawn, the movable peg pulled forward, and the piece of wood attached to the bowstring is wedged between the two pegs. To fire the bow the rear peg is drawn back by a short string passiiig through a vertical hole in the stock, and the bowstring is thus released. In the specimen figured a trigger-guard is added to complete the resemblance to a gun. War is made as among the northern tribe, but no prisoners are taken. The skulls of opponents slain in the great war or gembi are exposed in the village until the enid of the war, when they are given back and buried. Their religion is much the same as that of the Ba-Huana ; each adult is supposed to have a double soul, of which the elements are the doshi, or double ; and the m'tyinia, which corresponds to the bun of the Ba-Huana. The apparition of the m'tyima of a dead man is called mcafakulu (among the Ba-Hilana fakulu). Womeni suickling children nieither paint nor ornament themselves, anid must abstain from all sexual ilntercourse. In other respects the description of the Northern Ba-Mbala contained in the paper, to which repeated reference has been made, may be takeni as true also of the Southern Ba-Mbala. E. TORDAY. T. A.
