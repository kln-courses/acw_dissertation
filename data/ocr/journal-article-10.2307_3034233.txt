<plain_text><page sequence="1">DURGA AND THE KING: ETHNOHISTORICAL ASPECTS OF POLITICO-RITUAL LIFE IN A SOUTH ORISSAN JUNGLE KINGDOM BURKHARD SCHNEPEL South Asia Institute, Heidelberg This article discusses royal authority in Hindu India, and explores the relations and mutual dependencies between the domains of religion and politics. The data presented refer to one specific unit of political organization, the 'little kingdom' and, in particular, to the kingdom of Jeypore in south Orissa. Jeypore is further specified as a sub-type of the 'little kingdom', namely as a jungle kingdom', which is characterized by its remote location and a high percentage of tribal inhabitants. Special attention is given to the royal patronage of tribal goddesses and of the Hindu goddess Durga. The article considers how best to approach the vexed issue ofdisentangling 'tribal' and 'Hindu' components of religion, before examining more generally some theories advanced to explain the relationship between politics and religion. Introduction Questions concerning the nature of the relations and interdependencies be- tween the 'political' and the 'religious' domains and concerning the kind of authority held by Hindu kings have for long constituted the principal 'conun- drum' (Heesterman 1978) both of Indian ideology itself and of the studies that have tried to grasp this ideology and its more down-to-earth manifestations.1 The present article seeks to illuminate this issue by discussing ethnohistorical aspects of politico-ritual life in one specific unit of social and political interac- tion: the 'little kingdom'. The epithet 'little' does not refer, at least not primarily, to the size of a kingdom or to other measurable criteria. Rather, it denotes an abstract quality of a politico-ritual kind - and this quality is rela- tional, not absolute in character. 'Little kingdoms' are, therefore, characterized by their standing in often quite fickle and changeable relations to more power- ful and ritually superior kingdoms, which in this sense are 'great' though not necessarily 'large'. In Indian studies the term 'little kingdom' was first used by Cohn (1959; 1962) in his analysis of the political system of the eighteenth-century Benares region. Stein (1977; 1980) took up the term again, when he replaced the con- ventional historiographical notion of the medieval south Indian state as a centralized and hierarchically organized bureaucratic polity with the model of J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 1, 145-166</page><page sequence="2">146 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL the 'segmentary state'. Recently, little kingdoms have again occupied the atten- tion of scholars. Thus, for example, in The hollow crown (1987), Dirks shows that the study of little kingdoms offers a hitherto neglected view on the politi- cal, economic and cultural interconnexions that existed between the lower levels of social organization (i.e. the caste system, tribal communities, or vil- lages) and the higher ones (i.e. regional and transregional kingdoms, or the state). He also suggests that a focus on little kingdoms may shed new light on the problem of the nature of the king's authority and on the relationship between politics and religion more generally.2 The analysis presented in this article draws on these insights to understand the royal patronage of tribal goddesses and of the Hindu goddess Durga (or her equivalents) in various little kingdoms situated in the south of the Indian state of Orissa (see fig. 1).3 Of central concern among these is the former little kingdom of Jeypore, which was roughly coterminous with the present-day Koraput District. This kingdom was ruled for almost 500 years by the dynasty of the so-called Jeypore Suryavamshis, who established their power in the mid-fifteenth century and managed to retain it up to modern times. Jeypore kingdom is only one of many little kingdoms which were situated in, or had important links to, the former Orissan empire of the Gajapatis.

Map of Orissa.</page><page sequence="3">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 147 'Lords of the Elephants', as their title translates, were for a long time the 'great kings' of Orissa, with their base in central Orissa. As royal patrons of the famous deity ofJagannath, whose temple in Puri is one of the four most visited places of pilgrimage in India, the Gajapatis remained nominal overlords of the multi-centred Orissan empire even in times when their actual power had been severely curbed by foreign invaders.4 Most of the Orissan little kingdoms were situated either in a sort of semi- circle around the Gajapati seat of power or along vital trading or military routes, which indicates their strategic importance for the empire's defence. In south Orissa, now, one finds around twenty little kingdoms. While roughly half of these were situated in the coastal plains, the other half, including Jeypore, constitute a sub-type of little kingdom which I call 'jungle kingdom'. Jungle kingdoms have two main characteristics. First, ecologically their realms were situated at some distance from the coastal plains, in the remote and inaccessible hill territories of the Eastern Ghats. This peripheral location set limits to fertile lands suitable for intensive rice cultivation, but it constituted a military asset vis-a-vis potential invaders. Secondly, socially and demographically south Oris- san jungle kingdoms contained a high percentage of residents of so-called tribal or adivasi origin, a fact which found its reflection in the social, cultural, political and religious life of these kingdoms.5 It is necessary to point out that if the jungle kings managed to gain the trust, even the active solidarity of the tribal inhabitants of their realms, they were able to enjoy a high degree of independence from any one overlord: with the sup- port of tribal warriors who knew their habitat and with the right kind of guerilla tactics in these densely forested realms, they could easily resist any intruding force. It is, then, not surprising to find that the relationship between the jungle kings of south Orissa (who in most cases established their positions as 'enterprising' Hindus coming from the outside rather than as local chiefs) and their tribal subjects was characterized less by oppression or displacement of the tribals. Rather, the colonizing kings attempted to legitimize their rule inter- nally vis-a-vis their indigenous subjects and to integrate the tribal strata of their kingdoms into their own, the Hindu, fold of culture and power.6 Tribal goddesses An important means by which south Orissan jungle kings could pursue their legitimizing and incorporating policies towards the indigenous population was through the patronage of tribal goddesses.7 One example of such a goddess can be found in Rayagada. This busy mercantile town, situated in the high-plateau valley of the Nagavali river in the east ofJeypore kingdom, temporarily served as the royal capital in the sixteenth century under Viswanatha Deo (1527-71). The most visited and richest temple of the town, probably then as nowadays, is dedicated to the goddess Madhighariani, who is worshipped in the form of seven white stones, the largest of which is painted with vermilion to represent her head. Madhighariani's face is marked with impressive eyes and dark eye- brows, a silver nose decorated with ornaments, and a golden mouth out of which a silver tongue strikingly protrudes. At times of puija the head of the</page><page sequence="4">148 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL goddess and the floor around the image are covered with garlands of flowers, under which the stones that constitute the image are hardly recognizable. The greatest annual festivals at the temple are Durgapu-ja in autumn and the tribal feast of caitra parva in spring. One of the most important annual rites in former times was the sacrifice of a human being during the eighth night of Durgapu-ja. Nowadays, the number of sheep, goats and chickens sacrificed on this and other great annual events, as well as on Sundays and Tuesdays, is large, though worshippers also offer coconuts, bananas, rice and flowers on more routine visits or when their financial capacity is limited. The priests of the temple belong to the low-ranking caste of paiks, who formed the militia of the former kings. According to local informants, the stones of the image of the goddess simply came out of the earth one day at exactly the sacred spot now occupied by the temple. This notion expresses the strong territorial anchorage and local identity of the goddess. When Viswanatha shifted his capital from Nandapur, the erstwhile royal capital, to Rayagada, he built his fort around the goddess's already existing sacred locality and adopted her as his tutelary goddess or ista devata. Madhighariani's name, which means 'in the middle of the fort', thus points to a process of royal absorption of a formerly tribal cult. Madhighariani represents only one example of a large number of local god- desses who enjoyed the patronage of south Orissa's little kings.8 Up to now the worship of tribal mother and earth goddesses represents a most popular feature in the region's religious life. These goddesses usually have local importance only, but within their limited domains of influence they are greatly respected and feared. They are held to have a decisive influence on the fertility of the land and on the well-being of its inhabitants; they are also held responsible for misfortunes, droughts and other calamities in the life of an individual or of the community as a whole. They are often worshipped in the form of aniconical images or symbols such as stones, trees or mounds of earth. Their worship consists in sacrifices of pigeons, chickens, goats, buffaloes and, in former times, human beings. The priests are of tribal or low-caste origin, and possession of priests and worshippers by the goddesses in front of their symbols is a frequent occurrence. Royally patronized tribal goddesses such as Madhighariani have undergone various kinds and degrees of 'Hinduization'. Iconographically, the original aniconical representations have been anthropomorphized: i.e., initially wor- shipped in the form of stones, trees or earthen mounds, these goddesses have been given a more human form and appearance. Minimal additions in this process are the shaping of a head out of the aniconical symbol, which is then covered with eyes, a mouth and a most striking feature - a large protruding tongue. Less frequent are papier-mache arms which are attached to the bodies (where bodies exist at all). Furthermore, in this process of humanization the goddesses are no longer left out in the open but are housed in temples or at least placed under roofs. In most cases these temples are located - and here Madhighariani's temple, being in the middle of the fort, is an exception - at the edge of the jungles, i.e. in liminal positions between settled space and wilder- ness. Even then, they are often said to be merely the secondary offshoots of more original places of worship, situated on top of steep hills or in forested areas.</page><page sequence="5">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 149 As far as the cults of these partially Hinduized goddesses are concerned, we find that they are worshipped more regularly than their tribal counterparts and that full-time priests have been put in charge of this task. These priests still come from a tribal and low-caste background, their duties often revolving periodically between several related families. In their ritual practices, the priests tend to adopt the kind of Hindu worship known as puja, which in great Hindu temples ideally consists in the offering of sixteen articles (upacaras) to the deity three or more times a day. In the temples of these goddesses, however, puja is carried out less frequently, and normally consists of five to six kinds of offering only.9 Blood sacrifices are still performed, though there is a tendency to replace them with red flowers called man.daro and with other offerings that count as substitutes. Frequently, blood sacrifices are not only restricted in number but also spatially removed from the main image, being carried out at a distance away from it, sometimes even outside the temple precinct. Royal patronage of powerful and respected local goddesses was one of the most effective means available to an outside king seeking to obtain the trust and support of the original inhabitants of his new realm. It established some kind of legitimacy for these kings, since it linked them ideologically and ritually to the very earth of their kingdoms and to their tribal inhabitants. Moreover, they were seen not only as patrons of the goddesses but also as their chosen favourites. Royal patronage of local goddesses was therefore particularly important in the initial and consolidating phases of a newly established dynasty, though it hardly ever diminished in importance, not even during centuries of established rule. As a consequence of their royal patronage, these goddesses came to be re- spected by all those who belonged to a given little kingdom, though they never lost their local roots completely and remained most powerful in their locations of origin. While their fields of influence thus became wider, in another sense they became narrower, because to a certain extent the goddesses were appropri- ated by their royal patrons. The latter adopted a given goddess as the personal tutelary deity (ista devata) of their house (ghoro devata), of their family (ku6a devata), of one part or gate of their realm, or of the kingdom as such (rastra devata). In these functions, the goddesses offered privileged protection and blessings for their royal patrons at the expense of the original worshippers. A last example of a royally patronized tribal goddess can be found in the northeastern corner of Jeypore kingdom, where powerful local rulers, the thatrajas of Bissamcuttack, held a position which was nominally subordinate to the Jeypore kings but in fact was held independently of them. These 'warrior kings' or 'commanders of the troops' patronized the village deity orgrama devata of Bissamcuttack, known by the name of Markama and worshipped in the form of two large stones. One of these stones, painted red and covered with numerous silver eyes and a large protruding tongue, functions as the goddess's head, the other as her body. Some legends of Markama, as told by the goddess's head priest, illustrate aspects of the royal patronage of tribal goddesses not mentioned so far. In one of these legends, the king appointed a Brahman priest to do service at the temple. However, Markama did not like this idea and kicked the Brahman when he turned his back on her, so that he fell and became unconscious.</page><page sequence="6">150 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL Markama then appeared to the king in a dream demanding that her original priest of paik origin be put in charge again. Another legend concerns the loca- tion of the goddess's temple in a grove just outside the town, a spot which was deliberately chosen by her when she first came to the place. It is narrated that the king at one point in history was attacked by his Jeypore overlord because he had not paid his tribute for many years. One of the Maharaja's generals asked for the location of Markama's temple, as this goddess was thought to have been taking sides with the thatraja, appearing in the form of a milkmaid selling poisoned milk to the enemy's soldiers. When the general reached the temple, he shot the goddess with a big gun, so that her head fell off Soon afterwards, he died as a result of Markama's revenge, and the Maharaja withdrew his forces. On account of his ista devata being open to attack by enemies, the thatra-ja planned to move the goddess from her favoured spot into his fort. However, Markama again resisted his plans when she appeared in a dream to a priest revealing that she did not want to leave her home and be brought into the fort. The king then built a temple dedicated to the goddess Durga next to his palace instead.10 These legends concerning Markama hint at a more general feature, namely a certain tension between tribal and Brahman priests, between the temple of the tutelary deity outside the fort and the temple inside the fort, and between the local goddess and Durga. 'While there are no indications of tensions in the development from tribal goddess to a partially Hinduized folk deity, it seems that at one point in the royal patronage of goddesses - a point where popular Hinduism is transformed into a more orthodox and codified form of Brahmanism - local goddesses and indigenous worshippers resist their further absorption. Hence, while the royal patrons partially succeeded in bringing these goddesses down from the mountains and out of the wilderness and in 'domesticating' them, they were not able to appropriate them completely. Royally patronized tribal goddesses thus developed into liminal beings, for they originated from a tribal background and moved into the fold of Hindu culture without, however, being completely alienated from the former or to- tally absorbed by the latter. In this intermediary state, they were well qualified to bridge the initial gulf between the indigenous population and the Hindu king and to provide a crucial element in the ritual policy of the kings, especially with regard to their internal legitimation during the early phase of their rule. One can then find in south Orissa (and in Orissa generally) numerous in- stances where persons striving to become kings, or kings competing for dominance in a given area, fought for access to a sacred spot and for a promi- nent position in a local goddess's cult. Often such persons worshipped several local goddesses at different places and with different functions or, as in Bissam- cuttack, they tried to destroy the enemy's tutelary goddess, thus hoping to destroy his major source of power too. Durga and the king Royally patronized tribal goddesses gradually came to be associated in cult, iconography and iconology with more orthodox Hindu goddesses, Durga being the most common among them. Some of them, for example, are known</page><page sequence="7">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 151 as 'Vana Durgas' or 'Forest Durgas'. Markama, again, counts in local tradition as well as in the late-medieval Oriya version of the MahabhWrata by Sarala Das as one of Durga's stalwarts in her battle against the demons. But generally these goddesses were not completely absorbed by or identified with Durga. They usually retained their names and other features of their personalities. The rela- tionship between tribal goddess and Durga remained one of association and there was no metamorphosis of tribal deities into Hindu Durgas. It can be observed that most if not all south Orissan little kings, like the thatraja of Bissamcuttack after he had failed to move Markama into his fort, adopted as tutelary deity a Hindu goddess in addition to the tribal one. This patronage of a deity of a more orthodox Hindu background and wider, pan-Indian or at least regional recognition - besides Durga, the most common among these goddesses are Kali, Bhairavi, Camunda and Manikeshvari, all depicting fierce manifestations of the Great Goddess - is another important element in the ritual policy of the south Orissan jungle kings to be considered now. There is a new quality in the patronage of these goddesses, not only in that they and their cults were more 'Hindu' and less 'tribal' in character. More important than over-emphasizing such a conceptually problematic distinction is the fact that these goddesses were not rooted in the territories newly colo- nized by the kings. Their images (or mniurtis), which usually conform to the iconographical norm of the demon-killing (mahisasuramardini) Durga, were moveable, and as such they could be and often were brought in from the outside. Once installed, the powers associated with statues of Durga or compa- rable goddesses made these into powerful additional sources of royal legitimacy and into contested objects of political struggle. South Orissan legends concerning these murtis often report that the images came into the possession of their owners only after they were 'stolen'. This topos can be found expressed, to give one example from outside Jeypore, in a legend concerning the origin of the kingdom of Parlakimedi, situated east of Jeypore. According to this legend, a prince called Bhima Deo went into the hinterland of south Orissa in search of a kingdom of his own. A local man recognized the noble birth of the prince and inquired about the reason for his journey: The prince replied that he was in distress, and in quest of some country over which he might become ruler. The man carried him on his shoulders until they came to a place where eight chieftains, desirous of a prince to rule over them, were assembled in council. He was gladly received and became the head of a small tract in Kimedi, designated the country of the 'Eight Mallikas' ... While being carried on the man's shoulders, he made an inward vow to sacrifice him to some chosen goddess, if he obtained his wishes. The votary, on being informed of his fate, cheerfully offered himself for immolation, but the affair was deferred, the prince being for the present perplexed as to his choice of a goddess. Mean- while the wanderer carried his arms into Kalahundy country, and subdued it. The capital ... was attacked and the inhabitants forsook it. In it there was a Brahmini, a widow, who had an only daughter, whom she tenderly loved. But the girl had died and the mother had formed an image from her jewels and golden ornaments. When the village was deserted, the widow fled and abandoned the image. In course of time the image became endowed with the gift of speech, when it gave out that the deceased girl had been deified, and was to be worshipped hereafter under the symbol of this jewelled image, and with the title of 'Manikeswari' or the 'Goddess of the Jewel'. In her the prince found his 'Ishta Devi' and to</page><page sequence="8">152 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL her sacrificed his victim; and when resigning Kalahundy he took the image with him and enshrined it in his new capital (Carmichael 1869: 88-9)." By contrast to Bissamcuttack, where the acquisition of a Durga image gained significance only at a point when the kingdom had already been consolidated and when the locally most important goddess could not be appropriated any further, in this legend the acquisition of the image is depicted as having been crucial to, and even constitutive of, the foundation of the kingdom. For the prince did not end his quest after being offered lordship by the tribal chiefs. Instead he went on with his wanderings in search of a goddess to whom he could sacrifice and who would be his tutelary deity. The legend of Bhimo Deo also brings home to us that by stealing the image from someone else, the prince and aspiring king not only acquired the greatly desired image and the alliance of a powerful goddess connected with it, he also proved himself to be a worthy new owner of the goddess: he demonstrated his merit as a king through action, proved himself as strong enough to defeat the former proprietor, and pleased the goddess by offering a human sacrifice. The story also links the worship of the goddess with the ritual killing of a tribal leader and with human sacrifice in general, which was an important royal ritual practice in a number of south Orissan jungle kingdoms.12 In the family chronicles of the Jeypore dynasty, theJayapura Raja Vamsyavali, we encounter a different version of the topos of the stolen image.13 There Vijaya Chandra, the second king of the Jeypore dynasty (probably reigning from 1476 to 1510), is credited with the following feat: Purushottama Dev launched a war against Kanchi, defeated the king, and brought his daughter, princess Padmabati, along with the image of Lord Ganesh, Lord Gopal, Lord Narayan, made of black marble stone, and Goddess Jaya Durga made of gold. On their retreat to Puri they crossed the border of Nandapur kingdom. At that time Vijaya Chandra blocked the road and forcibly snatched away the image of Kanak (golden) Jaya Durga and Lord Narayan which were carried on the back of an elephant. He installed the two images in Nandapur and performed all the seasonal ceremonies of Kanak Durga (Sarma 1938: verses 147-54). In this legend the damaged party is not represented, as in the Parlakimedi version, by a defeated king of inferior or at best equal status. Instead, the legend narrates the theft of a Durga image by a little king from his own overlord. This mufrti, we are told, was part of the booty which the Gajapati himself had cap- tured from another great king after a battle in which, it is implied, Vijaya Chandra had initially fought at the side of his overlord. Only on returning home from their common expedition, therefore, did the little king and former ally turn against his superior and deprive him of the image.14 Quite obviously, the theft of Durga (if it so happened) was not a trifling matter. On the one hand, the stolen image of 'Golden Durga' might have possessed some material value.15 But more painful to Purushottama will have been the loss of the image's ritual value. As Durga is said already to have been the family deity of the Gajapatis, the theft of the image represented a personal insult to the great king. Moreover, the theft constituted an obvious act of insubordination by the little king vis-a-vis his overlord, who is depicted as being unable to prevent it or to exercise any punitive actions afterwards. From the point of view of the little kings, in whose family chronicles we find the theft</page><page sequence="9">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 153 proudly reported, the capture of Durga seems to indicate that from an early stage their royal house was bold and powerful enough to claim some kind of politico-ritual independence. In addition, it is mentioned that the splendour with which the annual Durga festival was enacted 'fetched the king good name and fame all over India' (Sarma 1938: verse 155). This boastful statement once more suggests that in their ritual policy the Jeypore kings sought to emulate their overlords' achievements and aspired after 'greatness' themselves. Durga has been the family goddess of the Jeypore rajas ever since the image's capture and installation in the ancient capital of Nandapur in the late fifteenth century, and there are no signs that her worship diminished in importance up to modern times. Over the centuries, the royally patronized cult of Durga could often easily stand side-by-side with these kings' dedication to a particular local goddess as their tutelary and family deity. Simultaneously, these kings could well be devoted adherents of religious teachings which were not particu- larly sympathetic to, or did not stand in elective affinity with, the Shakti or Tantric forms of worship that dominated the cult of the goddesses. Viswambhara Deo 11 (1713-52), for example, is reported to have been a devotee of Krishna along the lines of the teachings brought into Orissa by the saint Caitanya during the sixteenth century. But Viswambhara is also said to have been greatly devoted to Kanaka Durga: Viswambhara Deo used to go to Nandapur daily from Narayanapatna on horses, each kept at a distance of six miles, in order to visit Kanaka Durga. The Raja never touched anything as food without having Darsan (visit) of the said Deity One day there was flood in the hill streams owing to continuous rains and the Raja was detained on his way to Nandapur and could not reach the temple of the deity, and hence he had to fast for two or three days. In the course of his fast, the Deity Kanaka Durga being much pleased with his devotion, ap- peared before him one night in a dream and ordered him to refrain from his daily journey to Nandapur and asked him to construct a small golden image of Kanaka Durga after the main image at Nandapur and continue worshipping at Narayanapatna (Singh Deo 1939: 80). This legend opens up another perspective with regard to the 'territoriality' (Kulke 1979a: 8) of these goddesses. Tribal goddesses and partially Hinduized goddesses such as Madhighariani or Markama possessed a strong local rooted- ness. With movable goddesses like Kanaka Durga or Manikeshvari, the matter was different. Certainly they did not lack in territoriality, as their sphere of influence was considered to be more or less coterminous with the realms of their royal patrons. But their power or sakti was not rooted in a locality itself It radiated from wherever their images were located, this being dependent on who the last owner was and where exactly he placed her, and it gradually diminished the further one moved away from this location towards the periph- ery. The patronage of movable tutelary goddesses thus allowed greater flexibility in a king's movements. Moreover, it expressed a kind of royal legiti- macy and range of authority which had gained some degree of autonomy from an all too narrow tribal or local base. Where this was the case, tribal tutelary goddesses could again lose importance and their cults be reduced to their original, locally confined sphere of influence. However, lack of territoriality and the greater mobility of statues of Durga and her like did not mean that an image accompanied every shift of a king's residence. Instead, in the jungle kingdoms of south Orissa the seat of the image</page><page sequence="10">154 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL of a tutelary goddess appears to have been more permanent than the residence of the kings. The story of Viswambhara's daily pilgrimages provides only one example of a situation where king and tutelary deity did stay in different places. In fact, injeypore kingdom the spatial separation of goddess and king occurred as early as the middle of the seventeenth century when, under Viravikrama Deo (1637-69), the royal capital was shifted from Nandapur to Jeypore, as already mentioned. This move to a new residence some forty miles away from Nandapur is said to have been undertaken on account of a curse of the god- dess. After six successive kings each had only one son, astrologers found Nandapur to be an inauspicious place. The fact that during Viravikrama's reign, Muslim domination had taken root in coastal Andhra and was gradually extending its sway into the hinterlands of south Orissa may have been taken as another indication of the inauspiciousness of Nandapur and of the strategic necessity to move the capital further inland. When leaving Nandapur, Viravikrama Deo most probably did not take the original image of Kanaka Durga with him, but worshipped a duplicate image of Durga. The removal of the original image of the tutelary goddess and her installation in Jeypore only took place over a hundred years after the capital was moved This event, which occurred under Ramachandra Deo II (1781-1825), is remembered in the family chronicles as follows: A hooligan named Mallaparaj carried out a coup in Nandapur with a group of revolutionar- ies. He was a notorious robber and was formidable. To keep it away from his mischief, a devotee carried away the golden image of Goddess Durga and hid it in a well. After a few days the devotee died and the hidden place could not be detected. The king could not find the image. At that time a learned man named Dibayasingh Nanda had come from Puri to pay a visit to this place. He was adept in occult sciences and many other learnings. He is the first ancestor of the Nanda dynasty in Jeypore. By applying his Tantric skill he was able to find the hidden image of the Goddess and please the king. The king then brought the image of Durga Devi from Nandapur to Jeypore on a saddle with pomp and ceremony, sacrificing animals at different halting places en route. The king had also given three villages of Nan- dapur to Dibyasingh Nanda and appointed him as the chief worshipper of the deity (Sarma 1938: verses 300-12). In this episode the topos of the stolen image is linked to the topoi of the hidden, the lost, the rediscovered and the newly installed image. In evoking these themes, the legend conveys the message that it is not enough just to steal an image, to install it as rnfii of the tutelary deity and to be a far-away devotee in order to claim royal status. A proper king also has to prove his ability to hold on to the image and to prevent its theft from yet another party. In other words, to acquire an image and to keep it in one's possession, that is what makes a man a king.16 According to the legend, Jeypore kings almost failed to prove their continu- ing worth as patrons of Kanaka Durga. To begin with, they do not appear as keepers of authority and order in the kingless town of Nandapur, as would have befitted them. For ultimately the theft of royal property was prevented not by royal soldiers, but by a lone individual. Moreover, the narrative suggests that at that time the goddess was not attended to by a properly qualified ritual expert. The devotee who hid the image appears as a layman and ultimately as too weak and unprotected to handle the powerful deity himself This is sug- gested both by his sudden death and by the way in which the chronicler puts</page><page sequence="11">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 155 this simple devotee into striking opposition to the ritual expert who then appeared on the scene. The narrative therefore represents the Jeypore kings as being at fault, both politically and ritually. But it also shows that the kings corrected their shortcomings by appointing Dibyasingh as chief priest of the goddess, by granting villages to his family, by making him into their royal priest and by having Durga installed in Jeypore. Legendary accounts aside, historically the transfer of Durga to Jeypore took place at a time of substantial political and religious change in the kingdom. Ramachandra's father, Vikram Deo II (1758-81), became involved in the mili- tary activities of the region's little kings against the British. This resulted in an expedition into the kingdom and in the subsequent destruction of the Jeypore fort in 1775. Ramachandra Deo II himself adopted a policy of co-operation with the colonial government. This shift of policy, combined with the fact that by the 1780s the British had fallen out with their erstwhile ally (and Jeypore's long-time arch -rival), the little kingdom of Vizianagaram in coastal Vishakapat- nam District, made Ramachandra into the colonial power's most important ally in the area. By the turn of the century, he was rewarded for his loyalty and for various services to the British when his tribute was settled at a compara- tively low figure. 17 The security that was felt to exist under British rule led Ramachandra to construct a new palace 'out in the open'. While the old fort was situated at the foot of a steep mountain range and with speedy access to its jungles in case of emergency, the new palace and its surrounding township were built at some distance from this natural shelter. The main feature of this new capital was the 'Great Street', or 'bada dafida', running on a north-south axis. At the southern end of this street were the palace and a number of temples dedicated to Hindu deities such as Raghunath, Shiva and Jagannath. With this abandonment of the old military stronghold and with the establishment of a new and more prestig- ious politico-ritual centre, the Jeypore kings sought to enhance and consolidate their reputation as dharnic Hindu rajas. For they now presented themselves as kings who fulfilled the moral duties of a proper Hindu king in that they built and patronized Hindu temples and acted as royal donors, inviting Brahmans into the country and granting lands to them. This kind of ritual policy was directed more at external legitimation, i.e. at gaining legitimacy as proper Hindu kings vis-a-vis other kings of the region and the colonial power. 18 Despite the introduction of new Hindu deities into the region and the osten- tatious placing of them under royal patronage, the cult of Durga was far from fading into meaninglessness. The very fact that she was brought to Jeypore and installed within the new palace compound, i.e. in the closest possible proximity to the king, expresses the continuing politico-ritual importance she was meant to play. This conclusion is also supported by the style in which her journey from Nandapur to Jeypore was enacted. According to the chronicles, it was a triumphant procession on horse or elephant, a rite of passage which was ac- companied on the way by a large number of impressive sacrifices. And the continuing significance of Durga in Jeypore was more than just a family affair. Far from being overshadowed by the cult of Jagannath, she remained at the very centre of the kingdom's politico-ritual life. For the kingdom's most</page><page sequence="12">156 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL important ritual of the year was represented not by Jagannath's 'car-festival' (ratha yatra) in June/July, but by the intertwined sequence of the festivals of Durgapu-ja and dasara in the autumn.19 'Hindu' religion and 'tribal' religion In an analysis of the structural-functional kind, one might interpret the data presented here by saying that different levels of politico-territorial authority correlate with different kinds of divinity. At the lowest level, we find earth and mother goddesses whose sphere of influence and recognition is locally limited. These goddesses originally possess importance in the ritual policy of local leaders and tribal chiefs only. However, they may acquire significant positions in the ritual policy of persons who want to become kings or who have just established a little-kingly status when their sacred sites are close to the fort or at strategically significant locations, such as mountain passes or borders. At the level of the little kingdom as a whole, local goddesses tend to be replaced in their functions as principal goddesses of the realm by Durga, a kind of deity with whom the former can be associated in mythology and cult. At this more encompassing level of authority, the royally patronized family goddess then becomes a fully developed rastra devata or state deity. Adding an evolutionary perspective, the royal patronage of local goddesses appears to have been especially important during the founding period of a jungle kingdom. The development in cult, iconography and iconology of tribal goddesses towards popular forms of Hinduized goddesses can then be regarded as running parallel to the growing integration of tribal strata into the kingdom. The installation of a Durga mfirti within the fort, in addition to the local goddess, and the growing importance of Durga in state ritual, indicate a further historical development in which the local base of power of a little king has already been consolidated and is sought to be extended beyond the narrow local or tribal base. Goddesses constituted only one divine focus in the politico-ritual life of south Orissan jungle kingdoms and in the ritual policy of their rulers. There were other elements and developments that could not be discussed here, such as the growing politico-ritual importance ofJagannath or the personal inclina- tions of various kings towards certain Hindu schools of thought or belief These developments express a stage in the ritual policy of the jungle kings which was no longer directed primarily at their internal legitimation vis-a-vis their subjects. Rather, they represent the efforts of internally well-established little kings to obtain royal recognition by the other little kings of the region, by the great king in the overall political system, or by the various foreign powers. By combining these structural-functional and evolutionary views, one might argue that the religious sequence from tribal goddess to partially Hinduized folk deity to Durga and to Jagannath or Vishnu runs parallel to the political sequence from local chief or outside invader, to newly established little king, to consolidated little king, and to a little king who seeks recognition as dharmic Hindu king or even great king. To be sure, any such model-building over- simplifies and petrifies what in practice are rather complex, fluid, coeval, ambiguous and at times hotly disputed matters. Iconographically, we may well</page><page sequence="13">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 157 find an aniconical symbol, a partially anthropomorphized idol and an orthodox Hindu muirti standing side by side in the same temple precinct. Similarly, it is quite common to find blood sacrifices and pu-ja worship as parts of the same ritual process. The eclectic and polysemantic nature of worship in these god- desses' temples compels us to point out the danger inherent in using terms like 'Hinduization' or 'Brahmanization' too narrowly and in too unilineal a sense. The use of these terms is thus valid only if they are clearly understood as depicting ideal-typical processes, not factual ones. In this sense, the present article is informed by an ideal-typical opposition between tribal and Hindu religion. The former is characterized by aniconical symbols as the seats of deities, by irregular worship and the carrying out of blood sacrifices, by tribal priests as being in charge, and by priests and worship- pers being possessed in front of the deities. Hindu religion, by contrast, is marked by the existence of anthropomorphic muirtis as the seats of the deities, by the conduct of regular pu-ja-services under the control of Brahman priests, and by the deities' vegetarianism. These two kinds of religious expression can only be regarded as poles on a continuous scale with a degree of overlap and on which movements to one side or the other may occur.20 Sontheimer's distinction of five components of Hinduism (1989), namely Brahmanism, asceticism, folk religion, tribal religion and bhakti forms of wor- ship, offers another way out. He stresses that these components are not watertight compartments but interact among each other in a fluctuating proc- ess. This perspective, which focuses not on monolithic blocks of supposedly pre-existing entities but on relations and interdependencies, may provide better access to an understanding of the mixture of ritual components and its oscilla- tory nature, both at a certain point of time and through time. But while the data presented here indicate how tribal, folk, Brahmanic and bhakti compo- nents of Hinduism combine in the jungle kingdoms of south Orissa, it is less clear how the ascetic or renunciatory elements of religious belief and practice fit in. This is the place to return to my identification of the jungle kingdom as a specific kind of little kingdom characterized by two main criteria. One crite- rion was of an ecological kind, taking note of the remote, densely forested and badly irrigated nature of these realms. The other was of a socio-demographic kind, pointing to the high percentage of tribal inhabitants. In the course of discussion, this rather empirical characterization was extended into a more ideational one when the Hinduized tribal goddesses were seen as liminal be- ings who stand between tribal and Hindu culture, between jungle and village. On a more abstract level, this distinction was presented as one between wilder- ness and civilization. The differentiation between two differently experienced and valued kinds of landscape is conceptualized in the Sanskrit terminology of the 'great tradition' as that between vana and ksetra, or 'wilderness' and 'settled space'.21 In the daily activities of the people, the distinct quality of these two domains is experienced in quite practical ways; moreover, it constitutes a vital ordering principle in tribal and folk religions, for example when forest spirits are ritually prevented from entering a village. As far as the level of royal authority is concerned, one must recall the great importance that is given in classical Indian ideology of</page><page sequence="14">158 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL kingship to the mythologically envisaged or symbolically enacted royal con- quest of the domain of wilderness.22 The very existence of south Orissan jungle kings mirrors this part of the Hindu ideology of kingship; and their actual situations in life seem to embody the ascetic ideal of leaving settled life and entering the domain of the forest. Especially in their close day-to-day contact with the tribes and in their relationships with the dangerous local goddesses, these kings may be taken historically to have exhibited the courage to face and domesticate the powers of the wilderness, a capacity which in the mythology of the great tradition represents one of the essential marks of a true king. Vana and ksetra are not two opposed and incompatible kinds of landscape. Rather, they occupy two complementary poles on a continuum in the people's experience of their habitat and of the various forces associated with it. Though the boundary between wilderness and settled space is usually sharply drawn and ritually marked, at other times one domain may gradually fade into the other; at times the two poles may even change sides. In their liminal positions between vana and ksetra, partially Hinduized local goddesses and Durga are suitable mediators linking these two domains and oscillating between them. Their capacity to transgress boundaries and to participate in elements on either side of them makes them suitable agents for the legitimation of kingly rule in tribal society. In this sense, the developments that accompanied the estab- lishment of jungle kingdoms in south Orissa, such as the subsuming of tribal groups under a Hindu type of domination and the concomitant changes in the lives of these groups, might perhaps best be captured not by terms like 'Hin- duization' or 'Sanskritization', but by the term 'ksetra-ization'.23 Ritual and politics It will have become obvious that the problem does not consist only in finding ways to describe and analyse the existing mixture of various kinds of religious forms and teachings and their historical developments. There also arises the question of how to interpret the interrelations and mutual dependencies be- tween religion and politics. In modern European ideology, and hence in the conceptual paradigms that guide Western scientific thought, these two do- mains, as is well known, have come to be regarded as two separate things. And it can be found that some such perspective particular to Western thought is reflected in the interpretation of kingship in India. For example, in one article about the political system of the eighteenth-century Benares region, Cohn (1962) seeks to come to terms with the interrelation- ships between kingdoms at various levels of the system by distinguishing between power on the one hand and authority on the other. In his discussion, he first gives historical instances of the Benares raja's insubordination towards his superior, the Nawab of Oudh, which the latter apparently did not have the power to punish effectively. Cohn then explains why the raja nevertheless occasionally showed his loyalty and subordination to the nawab as follows: 'On the raja's side was the need for legitimacy ... Power the raja had, but he needed authority as well' (1962: 489). The hierarchy of the political system, as envisaged</page><page sequence="15">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 159 by Cohn, was therefore dominated not by relations of power, but by relations of honour and legitimacy. Cohn's distinction between power and legitimate authority is reflected in Stein's analysis of the medieval Cola empire (1980). Stein argues that what many scholars before him had seen as expressions of Cola political dominance was in fact no more than ritual hegemony. Medieval political systems in India, according to Stein, were multicentred, that is they consisted of a number of political centres similar in kind, of which one, however, was acknowledged by the others as exercising ritual sovereignty. The actual political power of this prime centre was limited, and it faded the more one moved from the centre to the periphery of the realm where sovereignty tended to be merely ritual. In this model, Stein thus directly connects power with the realm of politics and authority with that of ritual. Moreover, he ascribes different kinds of effective- ness to these two aspects when he presents ritual as being 'merely' symbolic in nature, while politics is 'actually' effective. Kulke, to give a last example, studied the history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa and the historical development of their ritually and ideologically ex- pressed relationship to the cult of Jagannath. This development resulted in a state of being where 'kingship became part of the cult and the cult became part of the Orissan kingship and its main source of legitimation' (1978c: 139). Kulke also expresses the view that the ideological and ritual link of the Gajapatis with Jagannath became closer the more their actual political power faded. His dia- chronic view of the relation between politics and religion thus mirrors Stein's synchronic one: in both models, symbolic ritual hegemony tends to substitute for real political power the more the latter proves ineffective, either at the periphery of a kingdom (Stein) or if power waned historically (Kulke). Cohn, Stein and Kulke have convincingly shown how closely politics and religion are interconnected in Indian kingdoms and how the one can only be understood when analysed in relation to the other. But all three authors have to be subjected to the same critique. None of them really regards ritual acts and beliefs as genuine forces and ultimate goals that directly motivate and guide the life of rulers and subjects alike. Ultimately they appear as little but ideological weapons in the struggle for power and legitimacy. In studies focusing on little kingdoms this distorted balance can be redressed, because kingship is studied not in classical texts or in historical inscriptions of great kings, but 'on the ground'. Thus, in one of his publications on the south Indian kingdom of Pudukkottai, Dirks points out, with direct reference to Stein, that 'the analytic separation of state structure from state ritual ignores the diffusion of ritual forms associated with kingship throughout all modes and levels of political relationships' (1979: 172). Elsewhere, Dirks (1987) directs the main thrust of his critique against Dumont for the latter's view of Indian society as being based principally on a religiously articulated caste system and for his way of interpreting the relationship between politics and religion. As is well known, the political and economic domains of life in Dumont's view are encompassed and, as far as the hierarchical system of values is concerned, dominated by the religious domain. The Brahman, who represents this domain with its principal articulation of the opposition between purity and pollution,</page><page sequence="16">160 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL is superior to the king, who in turn represents the political domain with its prime element of power.24 In opposition to Dumont, Dirks argues that, prior to the emergence of Brit- ish colonial rule, 'kings were not inferior to Brahmans, the political domain was not encompassed by a religious domain' (1987: 4). He further suggests that the social structure cannot be isolated as being autonomous and uninflected by political authority. Instead, he argues that 'Indian society, indeed caste itself was shaped by political struggles and processes' (1987: 5) and that 'caste was em- bedded in a political context of kingship' (1987: 7). Dirks stresses this point when writing that 'the prevalent ideology had not to do, at least primarily, with purity and pollution, but rather with royal authority, and honor, and associated notions of power, dominance and order' (1987: 7). Raheja (1988) also criticizes Dumont's strict separation between a ritual realm of values and a non-ideological, purely political and economic realm of facts. Like Dirks, Raheja regards this distinction as depicting a situation which mirrors less indigenous and traditional Indian values than relatively late British colonial interpretations and constructs. The ritual aspects of Indian sovereignty, Raheja claims, were misperceived or ignored by the British (and later Dumont) in such a way that important rituals of incorporation and loyalty as enacted in gift-exchanges were viewed either as bribes and manifestations of profligacy (at worst) or as purely economical transactions (at best). All this resulted in the fact that 'a complex indigenous transactional logic, informed by ritually elabo- rate notions of sovereignty, was replaced, in the colonial conceptualization of the situation, by a purely instrumental logic' (Raheja 1988: 499). Dirks and Raheja are two representatives of a school of thought in Indian sociology in which the Dumontian view of the relationship between status and power, and between the religiously superior but politico-economically depend- ent Brahman and the politically predominant but spiritually inferior king, is challenged. They seek a better understanding of Indian society by giving greater attention to the work that ritual does, ritual as a kind of action that should not be separated from the politico-economic domain but be regarded as being integrally and in complex ways related to it. In this view, central impor- tance is given to the role of prestations. These are not simply economic transactions but rituals of incorporation that play a critical role in the estab- lishment and maintenance of dominance and political sovereignty. While this approach certainly offers many new insights, it in turn has to be subjected to a special kind of critique. Dirks, as we have seen, criticizes Dumont's view of the Indian caste system as a purely religious phenomenon and of religion as encompassing the political and economic domains. This pre-eminence given to spirituality in the Asian mind is regarded by Dirks as a form of 'Orientalism'. Consequently, in his own study he sets out 'to stress the political both to redress the previous emphasis on "religion" and to underscore the social fact that caste structure, ritual form, and political process were all de- pendent on relations of power' (1987: 5). However, by thus counter-balancing a supposedly Orientalist view of Indian society, Dirks himself appears to be trapped in a particular Western, 'Machiavellian' view of society: ritual actions</page><page sequence="17">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 161 and beliefs are often presented as if being primarily a means to the pursuance of political power. To exemplify this point, it is instructive to look at Dirks's adaptation and interpretation of Hocart, an intellectual ancestor who has frequently been taken up in recent years in order to spearhead arguments against Dumont. For Hocart, in the beginning everything originated in and evolved from ritual; corporate social life is nothing, at least originally, but another form of ritual organisation. Consequently, all social and political institutions, no matter in what particular forms they appear, whether as democratic government or as a kingdom, originated in and developed from ritual. The Indian caste system, too, is regarded as being originally and basically a ritual system for the pursu- ance and maintenance of life or welfare, in which the king occupies a central ritual role.25 At various places Dirks acknowledges his indebtedness to Hocart. Moreover, he adopts Hocart's thesis of the oneness of ritual and politics when he holds that 'ritual and political forms were fundamentally the same' (Dirks 1987: 5). But Hocart's hypothesis of the ritual origin and basic ritual nature of political relations is an intellectual challenge which ultimately is not fully taken up. For Dirks does not take ritual ideas and actions as seriously as Hocart does. He does not see them as forces in their own right, that is, as forces which cannot simply be reduced to being other forms of politics or to being the dependent variables, with politics and the pursuance of power representing the prime movers. Religion, it appears, is mainly re-united with politics by Dirks in order to counter Dumont's view of the ritual sphere as encompassing the politico- economic one and in order to be put up as a sphere that itself is encompassed by politics. And because Dirks, as well as Cohn, Stein and Kulke, all ultimately treat religion as another form of politics and do not attempt to view politics also as another form of ritual, one challenging aspect of Hocart's thought is lost without bearing fruit. My discussion of the royal patronage of goddesses in south Orissa is still informed by a distinction between politics and religion as two distinguishable, though complementary and interrelated, domains. I chose to examine my data in this way because, in my opinion, an analytical distinction between the two domains has not yet lost its heuristic value and will continue to yield fruitful insights as long as it is understood that in actual life religion and politics in India are not clearly separable fields of action and belief Certainly, south Orissan little kings were aware of the political consequences of some ritual acts, which they instigated and supported, and they made deliberate political use of this knowledge. But it would be wrong to develop a kind of 'Priestertrug-Theorie' and to ignore that their deeds with regard to the patronage of goddesses were also, and even essentially, religiously motivated. For an understanding of their moti- vations, it is thus necessary to overcome both the distorting placing of politics on top of religion and the equally distorting view of the Indian mind as being oriented primarily towards the spiritual. Finally, it should be stressed that the more 'material', e.g. fiscal, economic or military realities, which undoubtedly also influenced royal actions to no small degree, need to be considered more</page><page sequence="18">162 BURKHARD SCHNEPEL closely than I could do here in order to arrive at a more complete picture of the jungle kingdoms in question. NOTES Archival and field research on the former kingdoms of south Orissa was kindly made possi- ble by a grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from December 1990 to April 1993. At present, work on a monograph on the kingdoms of south Orissa (Schnepel in prepa- ration a) is sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. I would like to extend my gratitude to P.K. Nayak, G.N. Dash, H. Kulke, G. Pfeffer, J.-C. Galey, M. Laubscher, G. Berkemer, C. Stewart and R. Parkin who offered assistance and guidance of various kinds to- wards the completion of this article, though the usual 'disclaimers' apply. 1 A number of other, often ill-defined oppositional terms like 'profane' and 'sacral', 'power' and 'authority', or 'ritual sovereignty' and 'political sovereignty', have also been used to charac- terize the two domains in question. For relevant studies, see Appadurai (1981), Burghart (1987), Drekmeier (1962), Fuller (1992: ch. 5), Gonda (1969), Heesterman (1979), Inden (1990: ch. 5), Marglin (1985), Shulman (1985), Toffin (1993), Trautmann (1981). Others will be discussed in the last section of this article. 2 For studies which discuss the politico-ritual aspects of kingship by focusing on little king- doms, see Bayly (1984; 1989: ch. 1); Berkemer (1993); Breckenridge (1978); Dirks (1987: chs 9 and 12); Galey (1989), Mayer (1985); and Peabody (1991). 3 Information on the royal patronage of goddesses in south Orissa can be found in Behera (1987: ch. 8), Mohapatra (1986), Rath (1987: chs 9 and 11), and Singh Deo (1939), as well as here and there in various government publications, such as Behuria (1964; 1965), Bell (1945), Carmichael (1869), Francis (1907), Maltby (1918) and Senapati (1966). With regard to god- desses and royal ritual policy in Orissa generally, I have particularly benefited from the in- sights by Eschmann (1978) and Kulke (1978a; 1979a; 1980; 1984). 4 On the Gajapatis and their relationship to the cult of jagannath, see Kulke (1978c; 1979b) and Schnepel (in preparation b). 5 The largest ethnic groups that might be called 'tribal' in south Orissa are the Kondh, the Saora, the Gadaba, the Paroja and the Bhumia. Substantial sections of these communities have been partially or completely integrated into the local caste system and have adopted concomi- tant socio-cultural modes of behaviour and belief 6 For an analysis of the relationship between kings and tribals in the hinterland of Orissa, see especially Kulke (1976; 1979b: 17-26). On the historical origin of the Jeypore Suryavam- shis, see Schnepel (1992a). 7 I have discussed the royal patronage of tutelary goddesses in south Orissa in two previous publications. However, these articles concentrate on tribal goddesses and exclude Durga. The following section, therefore, represents an abstract of the more detailed discussions in Schnepel (1993a; 1993b). On the ritual policy of Jeypore kings generally, see Schnepel (1992b). 8 Other examples are Khambeshvari in Aska, Thakurani in Berhampur and Mohuri Kalua near Berhampur, who are more closely discussed in Schnepel (1993b: section 2). 9 These are, as Eschmann (1978: 86-7) first noted, flowers (pu.pa), sandalwoodpaste (gandha), incense (dhuipa), light (dipa), food (bhoga) and sometimes a bath (snana). 10 Historically, this legend probably refers to one of the four military expeditions launched by Maharaja Vikram Deo 11 (1825-60) against Narendra Thatraj I. On Markama, see also Schnepel (1993b: section 3). 11 On a different version concerning Parlakimedi's tutelary deity, see Rajaguru (1972). 12 The practice of human sacrifice offered to goddesses by the jungle kings of south Orissa comes to light in British colonial sources in such a way that these reports do not appear to be figments of Western imagination. See, for examples, Carmichael (1869: 106); Francis (1907: 263); and Selections (1864). Boal (1982), Kulke (1976), and Schnepel (1993b) give further information. 13 TheJayapura Raja Vamitsyavali was written in 1938 by R. Nanda Sarma, the then 'Durbar Poet of Jeypore'. His Sanskrit poem, conceived on the basis of palm leaf manuscripts and</page><page sequence="19">BURKHARD SCHNEPEL 163 puranas, was kindly translated for me by Dr G. Nanda, Sanskrit scholar at Jeypore and relative of the vams'avali's author. 14 The legend refers to Purushottama's military expedition against the south Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara or one of its allies, which is remembered in the so-called 'Kanchi Kaveri tradi- tion' of the Gajapatis. See Kulke (1978c: 206-8; 1979b: 73-4), Dash (1978: 212-19). For a com- parison of several south Orissan legends concerning stolen images, see also Berkemer (1993) and Schnepel (1992a). 15 Singh Deo (1939: 12) doubts that the image of Kanaka Durga was made of gold and argues instead that it was made of an alloy of eight kinds of metals. The same opinion was expressed to me by a senior member of the royal family. 16 Is it an ironical twist of history that the image was stolen once again some ten to fifteen years ago? 17 See Senapati (1966: 69-71). 18 For an analysis of the evolution of royal town-planning and ritual policy in central Orissan kingdoms, see Kulke (1980). 19 For Durgapu-ja and dasara in Jeypore, see Francis (1907: 262-3), Sahu (1942: 33-6), and Schnepel (in preparation c). 20 For a more detailed view of such a distinction between tribal and Hindu forms of wor- ship, see Eschmann (1978: 80-5). 21 See Sontheimer (1989: 201; 1987). 22 On the concept of wilderness and the king's relation to it in Indian mythology and ritual, see Biardeau (1981), Falk (1973), Hara (1973), Heesterman (1957) and Shulman (1981). 23 The coining of the term 'ksetra-ization' is to be credited to G.N. Dash and H. Kulke. These authors (see Dash in preparation and Kulke 1992) are concerned more with the devel- opment from ksatra to ksetra than with the development from vana to ksetra. 24 This view is expressed in Dumont's Homo hierarchicus (1970) and in his earlier article on the conception of kingship in ancient India (1962). Intellectual responses to this part of Du- mont's work are too numerous to mention here, though see Quigley (1993) for a recent dis- cussion of the controversies. 25 Hocart's main works, originally written in the 1920s and 1930s, have been re-edited and reconsidered by social anthropologists from the early 1970s onwards. See especially Hocart (1970a; 1970b) and Needham (1970). For Hocart on caste, see Hocart (1950). An introduction to Hocart's scheme of evolution and the essential role he gives to ritual in this scheme can be found in Schnepel (1988). Dumont's own attitude towards Hocart is expressed in Dumont and Pocock (1958). Stein (1980) offers an early positive adaptation of Hocart's ideas in con- nexion with the study of Indian kingship. Dirks (1987), Raheja (1988), Galey (1989), Quigley (1993) and Schnepel (1995) are more recent authors who seek an understanding of Indian kingship in the light of Hocart's paradigms.

Durga et le roi: aspects ethnohistoriques de la vie politico-rituelle d'un royaume de la jungle du sud de 1' Orissa Resume L'article traite de l'autorite royale dans l'Inde hindoue et explore les relations de dependance mutuelle qui unissent les domaines politiques et religieux. Les donnees presentees dans cet article se rapportent a une unite politique precise, le 'petit royaume', et, plus particuliere- ment, le petit royaume de Jeypore dans le sud de l'Orissa. Suivant une classification plus rigoureuse, ce petit royaume appartient a la categorie des 'royaumes de jungle', caracterises par leur eloignement du centre et par la proportion elevee de leurs populations tribales. L'auteur porte une attention toute particuliere au patronage royal des deesses tribales et de la deesse hindoue Durga. Il considere ensuite la meilleure approche pour adresser une question jusqu'a ce jour non resolue, celle de la distinction entre les formes religieuses issues de la religion tribale et celles qui se rattachent a la religion hindoue. Il examine ensuite de maniere plus generale certaines des theories mises en avant pour rendre compte de la relation entre politique et religion.
