BERENBAUM Department of Entomology, 320 Morrill Hall, University of Illinois, 505 S. Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, Illinois 61801-3795 On July 10, 1995, at the 1995 meeting of the American Society of Naturalists, held on the campus of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, speakers at the Vice Presidential Symposium addressed issues on the evolution of specialization. The proceedings of that symposium appear here in this special supplement issue of the American Naturalist. The topic is ideally one of broad interest to the readership of the journal if for no reason other than that specialization for particu- lar diets or habitats is a remarkably widespread biological phenomenon. In a sense, considering the great species richness of certain specialist taxa, specializa- tion of one sort or another is the predominant lifestyle choice on the planet. Thus, the phenomenon attracts attention simply by virtue of its remarkable ubiquity. It has also undoubtedly attracted attention because it is so foreign to human ecol- ogy. Homo sapiens can be considered the ultimate diet/habitat generalists (bar- ring, of course, finicky 5-yr-olds). As Brues (1952, p. 38) aptly writes of the extreme oligophagy of many herbivorous insects, "It is as if a human would eat corn pone only, or cabbage, or onions, or cottage cheese, and never venture a baked potato, hot dog, or ice cream cone to vary the monotony." It was perhaps inevitable that, for many decades, discussions of the evolution of specialization were heavily colored by preconceptions based on human prejudices. Among the most basic problems in understanding how specialization evolves is simply defining the term. As Futuyma and Moreno (1988, p. 208) succinctly state, "Specialization must lie in the eye of the beholder." The meaning of the term is heavily context dependent. In terms of dietary specialization in insects, for example, a specialist has been defined as a species feeding on three or fewer plant families (Bernays and Graham 1988). Yet, according to this definition, a "specialist" associated with a locally species-rich plant family may utilize many more host species than does a sympatric generalist. Moreover, definitions of specialization well suited to describe certain types of ecological associations are woefully inappropriate for other types of ecological associations. For acarine parasites of vertebrates, for example, dietary specialization generally means re- striction not to three or fewer families of hosts, as it does for herbivorous insects, but restriction to a single species (or handful of species), or even to a particular part of a single species (e.g., the actinedid follicle mites that infest eyebrow hairs Am.

The assessment of specialization is also profoundly influenced by taxonomy-many species regarded as dietary general- ists have, on reexamination, turned out to be species complexes with individual members associated with only a subset of the entire host range. The tiger swallow- tail, Papilio glaucus, is still rightly regarded as the most polyphagous papilionid, in terms of number of host-plant families utilized. However, after P. g. cana- densis, a subspecies associated with a unique set of boreal hosts, was elevated to a species, the host range of P. glaucus shrank accordingly (Hagen et al. 1991). Also, there are discrepancies between fundamental and realized niches-host distribution and density factors may make a consumer population with the physio- logical capacity for a polyphagous diet ecologically monophagous (Fox and Mor- row 1971; Smiley 1980). Finally, the assessment of specialization is also influ- enced by vagaries of human interest; species of little economic importance tend to have narrower host ranges than do major crop pests. The host range of the economically unimportant and otherwise obscure Agonopterix clemensella (Lepi- doptera: Oecophoridae), for example, expanded more than threefold after only a single study over the course of one summer in one county in upstate New York (Berenbaum 1982). In view of the fact that simply recognizing specialization presents operational challenges and is subject to perceptual biases, it is no surprise that understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying specialization also presents challenges and is subject to perceptual biases. It is likely that no subject within evolutionary biology has historically been so contaminated by cultural prejudice. Systematists condemn specialization as an evolutionary "blind alley," "dead end," or degen- erate process (see review in Thompson 1994). Value-laden terminology abounds in discussions of mechanisms that are thought to maintain specialization; the prevalent concept that a jack-of-all-trades can be a master of none is the evolu- tionary equivalent of the diehard notion that the beautiful, popular cheerleader surely cannot be smart, too. Wilson and Yoshimura (1994, p. 692) define special- ists and generalists in terms of stark contrast: "Species are often faced with an evolutionary trade-off between performing a few activities well (specialists) and many activities poorly (generalists)." In addition to trade-offs in performance, these authors identified activity selec- tion, negative density dependence, and temporally varying environments as im- portant factors that can affect the relative fitness of specialists and generalists. Wilson and Yoshimura (1994) presented their views on the coexistence of special- ists and generalists in the pages of the American Naturalist, as have many others before them. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a more appropriate forum for a discussion of this topic; over the past century and a half, the editors of the American Naturalist have likely dedicated more pages to the subject of the evolu- tion of specialization than those of any other journal. What has changed over the years, and what is highlighted in this symposium, are the ways in which questions about the evolution of specialization are being approached. This journal has occu- pied a unique place among forums on the topic of the evolution of specialization since the turn of the century. Although Thompson (1994, p. 36) states that, in the world at large, discussions of the evolution of specialization in the first half of</page><page sequence="3">S80 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 1 A CENTURY OF SPECULATION ON SPECIALIZATION IN THE AMERICAN NATURALIST Years Article 1900-1919 Forbes 1909 1920-1939 Brues 1920, 1924 1940-1960 Amadon 1943 1960-1970 Levins 1962; MacArthur and Pianka 1966; Pipkin et al. 1966; Gans 1968 1970-1979 Bulmer 1974; Pulliam 1974; Sabah 1974; Wegsby 1974; Lowler and Smith 1976; Slatkin and Lande 1976; Holmes 1977; Levins 1979 1980-1989 Chesson and Warner 1981; Sale 1982; Greenberg 1983; Kuris and Norton 1985; Lively 1986; Rob- bins and Travis 1986; Wilson and Turelli 1986; Lynch and Gabriel 1987; Moran 1988; Du Toit and Owen 1989 1990-1995 Rosenzweig 1991; Hawkins et al. 1992; Wiegmann et al. 1993; Dayan and Simberloff 1994; Grover 1994; Kawecki 1994; Wesolowski 1994; Wilson and Yoshimura 1994; Gilchrist 1995 NOTE.-References were included in this list if specialization, generalization, or specificity of trophic or habitat associations were a principal focus for discussion. Articles dating to 1983 were identi- fied by computerized title and abstract search; before 1983, titles in each volume were examined by bibliographic inspection and con- firmation of article content. This list should not be viewed as defini- tive, as some relevant articles, particularly from older volumes, likely escaped notice. the century focused on phylogenetic patterns and morphological change, rather than on ecological interactions, the evolution of specialization in trophic interac- tions has been a recurrent theme in articles published in the American Naturalist for nine decades (table 1). Undoubtedly one of the first authors to remark on the ubiquity of specialization in trophic interactions was Forbes (1909, p. 289), who, in a discussion of the insect community associated with Zea mays, referred to "that nice fitting of one thing to another, specialization answering to specialization, either on the insect side or on that of the plant, which we sometimes find illustrated in the relations of plants and insects" (p. 292). He anticipated, in fact, discussions of trade-offs, activity selection, negative density dependence, and temporally variable environ- ments in differentiating among the adaptations displayed by herbivorous insects for a plant diet, recognizing "structural, physiological, psychological, synthetic, local, biographical, and numerical" factors influencing patterns of host plant use. Brues (1920, 1924) placed the discussion of dietary specialization in herbivorous insects in more evolutionary terms, examining phylogenetic patterns and advanc- ing possible evolutionary mechanisms capable of generating such patterns. Ama- don (1943), like many of his contemporaries, focused his attention on morphologi- cal specializations in decrying the concept of specialization as an evolutionary dead end but in his discussion specifically mentioned trophic specialization in</page><page sequence="4">INTRODUCTION S81 herbivorous insects and host-specific,parasites as analogous cases. Although mor- phology held sway as a central focus for discussions of specialization and specia- tion patterns for several more decades (e.g., Gans 1968; Holmes 1977), during that time trophic interactions were the focus for discussions of specialization at the microevolutionary level (e.g., Pipkin et al. 1966; Sabah 1974; Wegsby 1974). In the last 20 yr, there has been a steadily increasing number of publications directly or indirectly dealing with the evolution of specialization in an ever- broadening range of contexts (table 1). The contributors to this symposium vol- ume have been largely successful in expunging anthropomorphic preconceptions and maintaining objectivity in the examination of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying specialization. As discussed in the symposium, specialization involves both dietary and habitat associations, over a range of trophic levels, so that organismal biases arising from overfamiliarity with a narrow range of taxa can be minimized. Fry (1996, this issue) critically reexamines the role of trade-offs in promoting specialization within populations, particularly in the context of host specialization in herbivorous insects. Spitze and Sadler (1996, this issue) evaluate the adaptiveness of phenotypic plasticity as the generalist's mechanism for deal- ing with a variable trophic milieu. McPeek (1996, this issue) examines the ways in which trophic web structure comprises a form of environmental variability that influences patterns of trade-offs determining the degree of habitat specialization in different communities. With my colleagues, I (Berenbaum et al. 1996, this issue) attempt to define at the biochemical level a key innovation of the sort postulated to lead to dietary specialization and subsequent adaptive radiation in herbivorous insects (Ehrlich and Raven 1964). These contributions, then, exam- ine specialization at the level of the individual genotype, the population, the community, and the species group and encompass both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary timescales. All in all, if these contributions have a common theme, it is that generalizations can be misleading with respect to evaluating evolutionary mechanisms that both lead to and maintain specialization-a state- ment that is particularly apt and worthy of note, despite being a generalization itself.
