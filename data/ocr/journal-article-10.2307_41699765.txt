The finds reveal the rich diversity of ancient mu- sic cultures such as the Zapotee , Mixtee , and Mixe-Zoque. Based on the organological data , important aspects of the musical history of this cultural area can be reconstruct- ed . 1. Introduction In the present-day State of Oaxaca, Mexico, various cultures flourished over a large period of time (see Figure 1). According to the archaeological evidence, musical in- struments were deposited as burial offerings in the Valley of Oaxaca as early as 1400 BC. At about 500 BC, during the late portions of the Middle Preclassic period, Monte Albán was founded, one of the earliest urban centers in Mesoamerica. The site, which reached its peak during the Classic period at about AD 300-500, was inhabited by the Zapotees who developed great artistic knowledge. Monumental architecture, stelae, and elaborated sculptures made from ceramics and stone are highlights of the archaeological finds, while painted mural and carved reliefs indicate the existence of a writing system and use of a calendar. Numerous sound artifacts unearthed at Monte Albán suggest that music played an important role in the societies at that time. Since the Valley of Oaxaca has been extensively studied by archaeologists, the Zapotee culture is among the best docu- mented, but there are other regions and sites with archaeological evidence of sound artifacts, which are equally important in the study of the musical history of Oaxaca.</page><page sequence="2">68 • the world of music 49(2) - 2007 Fig. 1. State ofOaxaca, Mexico , indicating regions and archaeological sites mentioned in the text. 2. Preclassic Period Between 1500 and 500 BC, permanent village settlements were established near riv- ers in several regions of Oaxaca. Characteristic patterns of life in Oaxaca were estab- lished during this period: cultivation of corn, beans, and squash, household organiza- tion based on the individual (nuclear) family, division of labor, and burial of the dead near the house and accompanied by offerings. Population growth and competition between communities formed the basis for the emergence of complex society in the subsequent period (Winter 2004:20). 2.1 Valley ofOaxaca The Valley of Oaxaca is located in the central highlands of Oaxaca. The archaeolog- ical sites Monte Albán and Mitla are located here, as is the present-day capital of the</page><page sequence="3">Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago. An Introduction to the Music Cultures of Ancient Oaxaca • 69 Fig. 2. Whistling Vessel ( collection Frissell). Length : 17. 3cm, width 8.7cm, height 11cm (Photo: G. Sánchez ). state. The valley is divided in sub-areas, the Valleys of Etla, Tlacolula, and Zimatlan, and the areas of Ocotlan, Ejutla and Miahuatlan (Winter 1990:19). At the site Hacienda Blanca, located in the Valley of Etla, archaeologists excavat- ed a burial comprising a ceramic rattle, which also corresponds to the Tierras Largas phase. The rattle is spherical in shape and is among the most ancient idiophones of Oaxaca (ibid.Al). Its shape may imitate a rattle made of a small gourd or squash. Finds of early Zapotee globular flutes are reported from the site Santo Domingo Tomaltepec. One flute with two finger holes was found in Burial 85, and another flute with four finger holes was found among miscellaneous material. Both flutes were found in a cemetery corresponding to the San Jose phase, dating from c. 1200- 900 BC (Whalen 1981:35). The aerophones have resonating chambers in the form of a bird and probably represent sounding offerings for the accompaniment of the dead. Construction at Monte Albán around 500 BC on top of interconnected hills locat- ed in the center of the Valley of Oaxaca. Temple structures and an acropolis were planned on the hill-top, while the hill slopes were terraced, providing space for thou- sands of inhabitants. Among the earliest aerophones from Monte Albán, dating from the Danibaan phase, 500-300 BC, are globular flutes and whistles representing birds</page><page sequence="4">70 • the world of music 49( 2 ) - 2007 (see Caso and Bernal 1952:303-04). Like the flutes from Santo Domingo Tomalte- pec, the instruments were deposited as burial offerings. At the end of the Preclassic period the first whistling vessels occur in sites in the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca Alta region (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:164- 69). These vessels are composed of two connected recipients, the closed one show- ing an integrated whistle. When water is poured inside and the vessel is inclined to- wards the closed recipient, the movement of the water generates a hydraulic force that pushes the internal air to the windway of the whistle, thus producing a sound (Figure 2). 2.2 Mixtee Region To the west of the Valley of Oaxaca is the Mixteca region, a huge area divided into three different sub-regions: the Mixteca Baja, the Mixteca Alta, and the Mixteca de la Costa. An important archaeological site, Cerro de las Minas, is located in the Mix- teca Baja. Sound artifacts found in household structures of this site and dating from the Ñudee phase, c. 300 BC - AD 100, include zoomorphic and anthropomorphic whistles and one globular flute. The latter instrument has the shape of a bird with two finger holes and a tubular airduct. It produces a tritonic scale with intervals of a mi- nor third. In 1990, archaeologist Gregory Pereira unearthed a buccal whistle in Burial 3 of Cerro de las Minas (Pereira 1992:60-61). This aerophone was made from beige-color stone. It is unique in Oaxaca and similar to stone whistles found in the Valley of Te- huacan, Puebla (Velázquez Cabrera 2006:259). These noise generators may have be used as so-called gamitaderas or animal callers for hunting (ibid.: 255-56, 263). 2.3 Coast Region The hot and dry coastal region in the southern part of Oaxaca borders the Pacific Ocean. In this region, specifically in the valley of the Rio Verde, settlements existed in the Preclassic period, which probably were occupied by Chatino spekears. In 2003, archaeologist Sarah Barber excavated a cemetery of 33 human burials at the site of Yugüe, in the lower Rio Verde valley. In the northeastern part of Substructure 1, a juvenile of 14 or 15 years was buried holding a bone flute in his left hand (Bar- ber, in press). The flute was made of a deer femur with an elaborate incised design showing the skeleton of a personage. The instrument originally had four finger holes but unfortunately was found in a very delicate condition and is poorly preserved. It corresponds to the Late Preclassic Chacahua phase, AD 100-250. 1</page><page sequence="5">Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago. An Introduction to the Music Cultures of Ancient Oaxaca • 71 Fig. 3.

Sánchez 2004). 2.4 Isthmus ofTehuantepec and Mixe Region The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is located in the eastern part of the State of Oaxaca. It includes a wide coastal plain and the mountain range between Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz (Winter 1990:20). During the Preclasssic period, this region was occupied by Mixe-Zoque speaking groups (Zeitlin and Zeitlin 1990:432). In 2003, archaeologists of the Proyecto Salvamento Arqueológico Carretera Oaxaca-Istmo found several fragments of anthropomorphic globular flutes at a site called El Carrizal. The finds were associated with the residential structures dating from the Kuak phase, 200 BC - AD 1 . One of the flutes was found complete (Figure 3a) and in such good condition that its acoustics could be analyzed (Sánchez Santia- go 2006a:91-l 12). The instrument produces a sharp and high pitched tetratonic scale with intervals of a major second. The Mixe region extends into the mountain range of the northeastern part of the State of Oaxaca. Currently occupied by the Mixe, ethnic group comprising a popula- tion of about 80,000 people. In Juquila Mixes, a village in the Sierra Mixe, archaeo- logical material were accidentally discovered many year ago during house construc- tions. Here, several fragments of anthropomorphic globular flutes were found, which are similar to the finds from El Carrizal. One flute appeared complete and shows a</page><page sequence="6">72 • the world of music 49( 2 ) - 2007 stylized anthropomorphic form (Figure 3b). The sounds that can be obtained from this instrument are very soft and it is possible to play a tetratonic scale. That the flutes found at El Carrizal and Juquila Mixes appear similar may suggest that they belong to closely related Mixe-Zoque groups and the same musical tradition. 3. Classic Period During the Classic period the development of urban centers reached its peak. Com- plex societies diversified and manifested social stratification, the construction of monumental buildings, craft specialization, and the use of a writing system (Winter 1990:54). Monte Albán was the first and the greatest urban center in Oaxaca; other centers flourished in the Mixteca and other regions. 3.1 Valley of Oaxaca In Monte Albán and other sites of the Valley of Oaxaca, numerous fragments of whistles have been found in excavations. Principally two types can be distinguished: anthropo-zoomorphic globular whistles (Figure 4a) and anthropomorphic hemi- spherical whistles (Figure 4b) (Sánchez Santiago 2006a:33-45). The anthropo-zoomorphic whistles have a globular resonating chamber and a cir- cular windway. The airduct consists of an attached mouthpiece. These instruments do not show finger holes and are decorated with the wings and legs of birds. Connect- ed to the chamber is the effigy of a human figure with a headdress in the form of the jaws of a serpent (Figure 4a). The tonal range of these whistles varies between 322 and 818 Hz and reminds one of the too-whoo sound produced by an owl ( Bubo Vir- ginianus ), a very common bird of the Valley of Oaxaca (ibid. : 53-54). Taking into ac- count the specific iconography and sound symbolism of these instruments, it can be suggested that they represent the Zapotecan deity of the underworld, Pitao Pezelao (Sánchez Santiago forthc. a). The anthropomorphic whistles show hemispherical resonating chambers with human figures attached, possibly representing Zapotee priests or warriors (Figure 4b). The instruments do not have finger holes. The circular windway and tubular air- ducts are arranged in a manner in which distorted sounds are produced. The tonal range of these whistles varies between 683 and 1230 Hz. The anthropo-zoomorphic globular and the anthropomorphic hemispherical whistles were excavated in tombs, burials, and domestic trash deposits at several ar- chaeological sites of the Valley of Oaxaca, such as Monte Albán, Zaachila, Ocotlán, Mitla, Huitzo, Xoxocotlán, Ixtlahuaca, Etla, Cuilapan, Mucuilxóchitl, and Lambi- tyeco. They date to the Tani (AD 200-300), Pitao (AD 300-500), Peche (AD 500- 600), and Xoo (AD 600-800) phases.</page><page sequence="7">Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago.

Zapotee globular whistles : a (left): Zapotee globular whistle from Tomb 103 , Monte Albán ( Muso de las Culturas de Oaxaca , Oaxaca). Length 19.4cm, width 10.1cm, height 8.5cm.- 4b (right): Zapotee hemispherical whistle from Burial XIV- 9, Monte Albán (Muso de las Culturas de Oaxaca, Oaxaca), length 16.2cm, width 11.9cm, height 6.5cm ( Photos : G. Sánchez ). In the North Platform at Monte Albán several fragments of multiple tubular flutes were excavated, dating from the Pitao phase, AD 300-500. The morphology of these aerophones is similar to the multiple flutes from Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico and Gulf coast sites in Veracruz (Sánchez Santiago 2001:9). Archaeologists have ar- gued for a strong influence of Teotihuacan during the Pitao phase. People originating at Teotihuacan probably introduced these instruments to Monte Albán, which then were reproduced using local ceramics. Other aerophones found at Monte Albán are shell trumpets. One of these ceremo- nial instruments made from a Pleuroploca specimen with red paint formed part of an offering in Structure Y, dating from the Xoo phase, AD 600-800 (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:116, 119, Fig. 76). In the famous Tomb 7 of Monte Albán, Alfonso Caso and his collaborators also found a shell trumpet (Caso 1969:44-45). During the Proyecto Especial Monte Albán 1992-94 , archaeologists found sever- al fragments of bone rasps, probably dating from the Xoo phase, AD 600-800 (see Figure 5; Sánchez Santiago 2001:6-7). Huge bone rasps made from whale ribs were</page><page sequence="8">74 • the world of music 49( 2)- 2007 Fig. 5. Fragment of bone rasp. Laboratory of the IN AH Oaxaca (Photo: G. Sánchez). found at Monte Albán in earlier excavations (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:103, 105, Figs. 70-71). 3.2 Mixtee Region At Cerro de las Minas, an urban center located in the northwestern mountains of Oaxaca, several fragments of ceramic flutes with biglobular resonating chambers were excavated, dating from the Ñuiñe phase, AD 400-800. Some of the aerophones are associated with residential structures and were probably used in domestic con- texts (Winter 2007:96-97). They show three fìnger holes, supports attached to the resonating chamber and the airduct, allowing for a horizontal positioning, and the ef- figy of animals such as birds, rabbits, and bats. There is also a biglobular specimen showing an anthropomorphic figure wearing a buccal mask, identified with Ñuhu Tac hi, the Mixtee god of the wind, who is also depicted in the Codex Vindobonensis (Sánchez Santiago forthc.b). Both visibly and audibly, this find underlines the im- portance of the wind god in ancient Oaxaca. The dimensions of the biglobular cham- bers are variable, which suggest that a range of different tessituras occurred. Acous- tical experiments demonstrated that specific interval patterns were applied. It is possible to obtain tetratonic scales composed of minor third, third, augmented fourth, and diminished fifth intervals. Near Cerro de las Minas, at the site Santiago Chilixtlahuaca, archaeologist Mar- cus Winter recorded a tomb along with other material from site including a shell trumpet (Winter, Deraga, and Fernández 1976:36, 38). The tomb offerings and oth- er items correspond to the Ñuiñe phase, AD 400-800. The shell trumpet produces a vibrating sound approximate to E4. In the Museo Comunitario Ñiace , Tepelmeme Villa de Morelos (Mixteca Alta), is a shell trumpet with symbols of the Ñuiñe writing</page><page sequence="9">Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago.

Postclassic Period At the end of the Classic period, Monte Albán and other urban centers, such as Cerro de las Minas and Yucuñudahui, were abandoned, and new economic and political or- ganizations appeared. Various city-states with local capitals were established, inde- pendent and autonomous political units with their own territorial limits (Winter 1990:100). 4.1 The Cañada de Cuicatlán Region The Cañada de Cuicatlán is a deep canyon dividing the Mixteca Alta to the west, and the Mazatec and Zapotee regions to the east (Winter 1990:20). In 1984, archaeologist Roberto Zárate excavated two tombs in Santa Maria Tecomavaca, located in the Cañada de Cuicatlán region. The tombs date from the Iglesia Vieja phase, AD 1 100- 1521, and probably correspond to the Cuicatec ethnic group. In Tomb 1 fragments of bone were conserved, but could not be recovered due to their deteriorated state of conservation. Among the tomb offerings were stone, penates (anthropomorphic stone figures), shell, and two ceramic globular flutes. One of these instruments was well preserved (Figure 6a), the other one damaged (Sánchez Santiago 2006b:21). The flutes show one finger hole and perforations which allow suspension from a cord worn around the neck. The preserved one produces two notes with an interval of ap- proximately a minor third.2 4.2 Coast Region Recently, archaeologist Stacie King excavated some residential units at Río Viejo, a site located in the lower Rio Verde valley. Here, she found ceramic tubular whistles, anthropomorphic whistles, fragments of tubular flutes, and several fragments of ce- ramic bells dating from the Yugiie phase, AD 900-1200 (King 2003:217-26). A hu- man effigy figure was attached to one of the tubular flute fragments (Figure 6b). The windway of this instrument is located on the opposite side of the finger holes. 4.3 Isthmus ofTehuantepec In 2004, the team of the Proyecto Salvamento Arqueológico Carretara Oaxaca-Ist- mo excavated Paso Aguascalientes, a site located at the edge of the Presa Benito</page><page sequence="10">76 • the world of music 49(2) - 2007 Fig 6a-b.

The site is characterized by monumental architec- ture with public buildings, plazas and two ballcourts. In structure J, archaeologist Marisol Cortés Vilchis excavated 19 burials. Burials 21 and 26 are particularly inter- esting, as they included two aerophones made from stone. The instruments date from the Aguada phase, AD 900-1400 (Winter and Cortés Vilchis 2005:55, 62). The aerophone in Burial 21 was found near the skull of a female individual and may have been suspended from her neck when she was buried. The instrument is made from a beige-colored stone and has a rectangular shape. The resonating cham- ber is a cavity of conical-tubular form that was made in the center of stone. The mouthpiece is direct (without airduct). At one of the edges of the object a conical per- foration was made to form a finger hole. A third perforation was made in the middle section of the stone for suspension.</page><page sequence="11">Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago. An Introduction to the Music Cultures of Ancient Oaxaca • 77 The aerophone from burial 26 is of a similar type, but was manufactured from a green, metamorphic stone, possibly serpentine. Its chamber is likewise conical-tubu- lar, but the edge shows two perforations, probably as a consequence of an error when perforating the finger hole. In the middle section perforations were made for suspen- sion. This aerophone was found on the chest of a male individual suggesting that he also weared it suspended from the neck. It is important to mention that the aerophones approximately produce the same intervals Gb6 - G6 when the finger hole is covered and uncovered. Probably, these aerophones were used in a non-musical activity, such as hunting, due to their charac- teristic sound which can be heard easily at a distance of 500 metres or more. 5. Conclusion This paper provided an overview of the sound artefacts discovered in several archae- ological excavations, showing the diversity and complexity of the musical cultures that once flourished in ancient Oaxaca. Numerous sound artefacts in museum and private collections still have to be analyzed. Such investigations will add relevant data on the distinct types of sound artefacts used in the prehispanic era. Another im- portant research topic largely unexplored is the meaning and function of the pre- served sound artefacts in ancient Oaxaca. Perhaps archaeomusicology and other dis- ciplines can someday answer some of those challenging questions.

Notes 1 Other bone flute finds dating from the Postclassic period correspond to the Mixtee culture (Marti 1968:163-64, Dultzin Dubin and Nava Gómez Tagle 1984:32). 2 Burying high ranking idividuals with shell trumpets was a pattern applied in different regions of Mesoamerica during the Classic and Postclassic periods. 3 It is interesting to note that aerophones with a similar morphology were used by Nahua groups in the central Mexican highlands during the Postclassic period (Contreras Arias 1988:181).</page><page sequence="12">78 • the world of music 49(2) - 2007 References Barber, Sarah, J.
