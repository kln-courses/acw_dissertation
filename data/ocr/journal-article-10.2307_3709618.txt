<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN CATHOLIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW 271 Readings inAnthropology. Edited by Morton H. Fried. Volume I: Physical Anthropology, Linguistics, Archeology (482 pp.); Volume II: Cultural Anthropology (598 pp.). New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1959. Volume I, $3.00; Volume II, $3.25. The questions which might raise themselves after a casual- to-caref ul perusal of these two volumes are quite adequately dealt with by the preface and introductory notes which precede the selections. If one objects to certain omissions, or to the arrange- ment of selections, or to the lack of recognizable theme, the edi? tor has anticipated him by providing an explanation or defense. In a few instances this amounts to little more than a statement that this is the way he saw fit to do it, but more often the expla- nations are plausible and helpful. Eight of the thirty-three articles which go to make up Volume I are by British anthropologists, the remaining contributors be? ing American. The section on archeology is the lengthiest and contains several excellent articles of a general character. Leslie White's article on "The Expansion in the Scope of Science," re? printed from his The Science of Culture, is a somewhat shrill denuneiation of man's traditional animistic and anthropomorphic naivete. It closes on the hopeful (and naive) note that non- volitional and non-rational "object-man" will achieve a greater capacity for rational living when science "will have reached its final boundary" in discovery (and control?) of the inexorable laws of the development of culture. Volume II deals with various aspects of cultural anthropology ?its nature and method, social organization, ideology (including religion and philosophy), art, and music The brief section on cul? ture and personality is enhanced by Lindesmith and Strauss's ex? cellent review and critique of writings in this area. The inclusion of an article such as Robert Redfield's "Talk with a Stranger" adds human interest to the volume, but does not present Redfield at his anthropological best. The addition of a glossary and of a table indicating corre- sponding chapters in standard anthropology texts improves the chances of such a collection of readings being adopted as a text. Many teachers of cultural anthropology will regret that linguist? ics has been included in Volume I. Whether or not either volume is used as a text, most teachers will welcome this collection of articles of admittedly uneven quality from such a wide range of sources. Sister Mary William, I.H.M.
