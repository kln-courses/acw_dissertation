<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 25, Number 1, January 2008 LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM Jiyuan Yu Both Stoicism and Daoism claim that the ideal way of living is to follow nature and that living with nature is the same as living virtuously. For the Stoics, "living in agreement with nature" (homologoumen?s t?i phusei z?n) or "following nature" (akolouth?s t?i phusei z?n)1 is what constitutes happiness (eudaimonia, flourishing, living well), the ultimate end (telos) of human life. Correspondingly, the Laozi (chap. 25) states: "Man models himself on earth; earth on heaven; heaven on the way [dao], and the way on ziran"2 In this passage ziran is the supreme end which human beings emulate. The term ziran, which is used in modern Chinese to translate the English word "nature," means literally "so on its own," or "so of itself,"3 and has been translated as "what is spontane ously so," "that which is naturally so," "naturalness," or "nature." In the same spirit, the Zhuangzi holds that: "Whoever knows what Heaven does lives the lives generated by Heaven."4 This apparent similarity leads us to wonder whether Stoicism and Daoism really mean the same thing in advocating this way of living, and what the reasons are for each to hold it. Such a study can provide not only a different look at both Stoicism and Daoism, but also a better understanding of the idea of living with nature itself. While some have thought of this idea as an intellectual resource to avoid environmental anthropocentrism5 or as having aesthetical value,6 many believe that the appeal to the universal nature is not a reliable ground on which to build a specific ethical theory. J. S. Mill, for instance, claims that the notion of nature is ambiguous. He identifies two principal meanings, denoting either the whole of nature or things as they would be. If it means the former, the idea of living with nature does not make sense because we are a part of natural things. If it means the latter, the idea is that man ought to follow the spontaneous course of things. This, Mill contends, is "irrational" in the sense that human action consists in altering the 1</page><page sequence="2">2 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY spontaneous course and "immoral" in the sense that the course of natural phenomena permits many horrible things.7 To bring Daoism and Stoicism together is a challenging task. Although the ideal is at the core of both ethics, neither side presents and defends it systematically or even clearly. Each side has to be reconstructed, and as usual, reconstruction leads to controversy.81 shall focus on the fundamental and less controversial features on each side, although this will inevitably pass over many difficulties of detail. The study turns out that Stoicism and Daoism differ sharply over what nature is and how to follow nature, yet their different conceptions of natural life entail a similar life of detachment in society. What Is Nature? Ancient Chinese and Greek ethics generally appeals to human nature, although there are various notions of what human nature is. In advocat ing the ideal of living with nature, Stoicism and Daoism move one step further and ground their understandings of human nature in cosmic or universal nature. Both maintain that the nature of human beings is a part of nature at large. For Stoicism, "Our natures are parts of the nature of the universe."9 For Daoism, "The dao is everywhere," and nothing escapes it, including human beings.10 Although it does not use much the term xin (human nature), Daoism holds a dao-de structure: de (power or virtue which gives each individual its character) is the manifestation of the general dao in that individual. Indeed, it is due to the kinship of human nature with the nature of the universe that living with nature is the best life. In this sense, to conform to nature does not mean to conform to an external standard. What, then, is the nature of which human nature is part and with which human beings should live? For the Stoics, the universe is a liv ing animal with rational soul and structure. The nature of the universe is pneuma, a fiery form of air, which is present in the whole universe and in every single part of it as well. The Stoics identify pneuma with God. Although God is thought to take providential care of the world, the Stoic God is not anthropomorphic and does not create the world out of nothing. God is the rational soul of the natural world rather than a supernatural force. "God and mind and fate and Zeus are one thing, but called by many names."11 Since the Greek term kosmos originally means an ordered universe, it is not difficult to see that the Stoic theory of nature reflects the traditional Greek belief and has taken in various elements from Heraclitus, Plato, and Aristotle. The Daoist notion o?ziran (nature or naturalness) involves some com plexities. It does not directly refer to the natural world or the universe,</page><page sequence="3">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 3 which is described in Chinese in terms such as heaven (tian), heaven and earth (tian-di), or "the ten thousand things" or "the myriad things" (wan-wu), but is rather a state of the universe (for instance, Laozi chap. 64 speaks of "the ziran of the myriad things"). Yet there is a puzzle regarding its relation to dao. For dao traditionally means precisely the right state or course of development of the universe. Roger Ames indeed thinks that dao and ziran are the same: "In the Daoist corpus, dao in its broadest sense is the 'spontaneous' (ziran), or better-translated, 'self evidencing.'"12 Yet, since Laozi 25 says that dao models on ziran, how can something that models be the same as the thing that is modeled? This riddle leads to the issue of the ontological status of dao in Daoism. If dao is the dao of Heaven, it is the correct norms of Heaven rather than an entity in itself. Yet in Daoism, dao is said to exist before heaven and earth, and to give birth to and nurture the myriad things.13 It is invisible and ineffable;14 and "it is based in itself, rooted in itself."15 Dao described in this way must be an independent entity rather than just a state of something. Benjamin Schwartz therefore wonders: "How does a term which seems to refer in Confucianism mainly to social and natural order come to refer to a mystic reality?"16 And he comes to the view that in Daoism "the insistence of the word dao represents a striking departure from the centrality of the word Heaven."17 In contrast, Chad Hansen rejects the view that the meaning of dao in Daoism has been changed from moral guidance to metaphysical object.18 It seems to me that neither side of this debate is wrong, but each is only partially correct. In Hansen's favor, there is textual evidence that dao is still referred to as "the dao of Heaven,"19 and hence is continu ous with other schools' position. Yet there are also all the passages we mentioned above in which dao is described as an independent entity. Apparently, dao in Daoism is both an entity ("the dao itself) and a state ("the dao of . . ."). But how can it be both without involving a tension? To make sense of such an idea, let us appeal to Aristotle who holds in Metaphysics vii that form which is the "substance of an individual thing, is also primary substance. Form is both a substance and a "substance of." On the one hand, it is the way of the world and is immanent in the order of things; on the other hand, it is a metaphysical entity itself and determines the way of the world. The former aspect is continuous with its use in other schools, while the latter is the Daoist extension. How does this shed light to the relation between dao and ziran (na ture or naturalness)? At first glance, to say that dao models itself on ziran seems to suggest that ziran is more fundamental than dao. Yet this is puzzling, given that dao "is based in itself, rooted in itself." Why does dao need to emulate ziran and what does this mean? Dao is a key</page><page sequence="4">4 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY notion in ancient Chinese philosophical schools. These schools all pre suppose that human life can be good only if it follows Heaven's dao, but they dispute about how to understand this dao. When the Laozi says that dao models on ziran, he is giving a substantial answer about what dao is. That is, he is characterizing dao in terms o? ziran. Ziran is the dao of the universe, namely, the way that the universe operates. The expression "the ziran of the myriad things" means the universe's state of free flowing and self-transformation. To say that dao models itself on ziran does not mean that ziran is an external standard; rather it refers to what its right state or mode is. What Laozi, chap. 25 is saying is that dao is characterized by ziran and that this should be the right state of human beings, earth, and heaven. To characterize dao in terms o?ziran is the novelty of Daoism. If one simply says that the best life is to follow dao, this is a common premise of ancient Chinese philosophy. Yet, if one says that the best life is to follow dao as ziran (nature or naturalness), then we have Daoism. Ziran in Daoism is also expressed in a number of other ways, including "acting in its own way" (ziji), "doing it by itself (ziqiu),"20 and "self transforma tion" (zihua).21 All things in the world are in the state of constant flux and incessant transformation. This is how dao operates. From the above discussion, we see that in both Daoism and Stoicism, nature does not mean the natural world, but refers to what each school takes to be the most fundamental operational principle of the natural world. While Stoicism characterizes this operational principle as rational order, consistency and harmony, Daoism claims that it is a self-trans formational and spontaneous state. Different conceptions of universal nature lead to different views in these two schools about the human nature which is its part. In Stoicism, pneuma or God is present in every part as its nature, but in different degrees. Human beings, in addition to the nature which they share with other animals, also possess a distinct rational nature. Rationality is the true human nature and the source of dignity of human beings. Since human rational nature is identical with the cosmic rational na ture, human beings assume a privileged position in the structure of the universe. For Daoism, dao is characterized by the state of naturalness and spontaneity. Such a dao is in everything (including human beings) and forms the original and authentic nature of individual things. Dao is impartial and does not approve any distinction. "From the point of view of dao, what is noble and what is humble? They all merge into one."22 This is also called "the axis of dao" (dao-shu), from which anything can be said with equal warrant. For this reason, human beings cannot be</page><page sequence="5">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 5 provided with a special endowment. As everything else in the universe, the true nature of human being is ziran (naturalness). How to Live with Nature? Both Stoicism and Daoism believe that the good life is to fulfill the real human nature which is akin to the universal nature. Since, as shown above, they have different ideas of the universal nature and thus of the true human nature that is akin to it, they have different pictures about how human nature can be perfected and fulfilled, that is, how to live with nature. For Stoicism, living with nature is a matter of developing and nurturing one's rationality; yet for Daoism, it is a matter of restor ing our original spontaneous aptitude. The Stoics believe that human development is a progression from following our animal nature to following our rational nature.23 Each animal, as a part of the universe, is endowed with a particular natural constitution (sustasis, the healthy state of that thing), and also with an instinctive impulse (horm?) to preserve itself and its constitution. This impulse of self-preservation is called oikei?sis ("appropriation" or "congeniality").24 With this, a human being naturally pursues things which accord with his physical constitution such as health and wealth, and avoids things which are detrimental to the constitution such as sickness and poverty. Gradually, as a rational being, his instinctive impulses are gradually superseded by reason. He comes to realize the order and harmony in his actions, and can organize and arrange his natural impulses accordingly. His impulsive behavior then turns to "appropriate action" (kath?konta). Appropriate action has a broad reference, but when it is confined to human beings, it refers to an act "which, when done, admits of a reasonable defence."25 In other words, an act is appropriate if it is reasonable for an agent to do according to his nature and circumstances. Furthermore, he comes to appreciate that the order and harmony in his actions are far more valuable than the actions themselves, and eventually concludes "by intelligence and reasoning" that "this is what the highest good for man consists in."26 For such a person, "the life according to reason properly (z?n orth?s) becomes what is natural."27 This development from living out of instinctual nature to living in agreement with rationally ordered nature is itself natural, because reason is in our original constitution.28 Hence, educating a person's reason is the best way to make him a better person.29 To develop rationality, one must contemplate nature's rationality which permeates and governs the world, and model his deci sion and action on it. This is why Chrysippus understands "living with nature" as "living according to the experience of events which occur</page><page sequence="6">6 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY by nature."30 The universal rationality, which is the common law, the will of Zeus, or Right Reason, constitutes the only set of true principles which could guide a man to live consistently and unerringly. We must understand it in order to conform our lives to it. Given the kinship be tween human reason and the rational structure of the universe, we can in principle know the plans of this rational world-order, although we cannot foresee the future. Once we are in harmony with cosmic nature, we achieve a harmonious and self-consistent life, and are at one with the flow of events in the world.31 For Daoism, however, living with nature is a matter of going back to our pre-socialized and value-free mentality. It claims that our origi nal aptitude has been maimed because of our habituated tendency to formulate specific value schemes and then to judge and rank things according to them. The Daoist ethics is precisely to enlighten people in this existential situation and help them get rid of such a habitual inclination. Since judging and ranking are the typical forms of analytic reasoning, Daoism appears to be on the opposite side of Stoicism's goal of developing one's rationality. Laozi claims that all the guiding moral systems are not constant. All of them share the feature of constructing dichotomies and then find ing reason to favor one value and dismiss the other. Yet, first, all the distinctions these theories draw are arbitrary and groundless (Laozi, chap. 20). Second, even if there are opposites, the opposite terms such as having (yi?)/not-having (wu), the difficult/ the easy, the long/the short, the high/the low, etc. are relative and complementary to each other (chap. 2). Third, the opposites are reversible. Whatever is strong, hard, straight, and fortunate will in due course revert to being weak, soft, bent, disastrous (chaps. 22, 58). Dao operates by alternating between a contrasting pair (chap. 40). This cyclic motion makes every value reversible, and thus it is impossible to fix the priority of one member of the pair. Zhuangzi continues to criticize the human habit of making distinc tions and shi (yes)-fei (no) assignments. His focus, however, is on the relativity and incommensurability of multiple perspectives. First, accord ing to his allegory of the music of heaven, all doctrines are the natural music of heaven and hence each has an equal basis in heaven. There is no objective criterion by which to judge and rank them. Second, evaluation is always relative to the evaluator's perspective, and these perspectives are incommensurable. Different species have different reactions to things such as dampness, height and beauty;32 even the same agent reacts differently at different times. Third, within the same species, the great bird does not understand what flying means to the small bird. In every</page><page sequence="7">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 7 human debate over the alternatives, each side has its own standard of right and wrong. As a result, debate is unlikely to resolve.33 What, then, is the natural and spontaneous state that we restore once we cease to be guided by distinction-making? For Laozi, it is a state of wu-wei. Wu means "non" and wei means the purposeful action guided by a certain conventional value. Wu-wei (non-action) does not mean to do nothing; rather, it means to act without artificiality and arbitrariness (Laozi, chap. 38). It is a state of "acting without action" (Laozi, chap. 63) and "acting but not competing." (Laozi, chap. 81) Indeed, it is the best way to get things accomplished. "Dao never acts yet nothing is left undone."34 This is because in the state of non-action, all things follow their own course and nature (ziran).35 Zhuangzi employs a variety of expressions to convey this restored spontaneous state. It is a state of ming (enlightenment or illumination) which acknowledges the relativity of all perspectives and makes no judgment between them;36 a state of "letting both alternatives proceed" (Hang xing),37 and a state called "free and easy wandering" (xiao-yao yu), in which one rambles effortlessly without making any distinctions and transforms with the universe. Zhuangzi also uses the metaphor of a mirror to illustrate that this is a state in which one responds to the things as they are. "He does not escort things as they go or welcome them as they come, he responds and does not store."38 Furthermore, it is a state of sitting and forgetting in which one empties the mind by dismissing all sensations and knowledge, "going along with the universal thoroughfare."39 It would certainly be mistaken if we think that the Daoist natural state is just primitive and instinctual. For Laozi, wu-wei implies an in sight into the limits of wei (intentional action), and for Zhuangzi, ming presupposes an understanding of the relativity of all perspectives. The Daoist natural and spontaneous state is a mental state which can only be reached after discarding analytic reasoning and intellectual knowl edge, and which sees things "from the point of dao" or from "the axis of the dao." It is a way of living which is no longer bound by all sorts of artificial distinctions and procedures. Just as the story of Cook Ding indicates, to acquire such a state involves a hard and long process of experience and practice. In short, the Daoist spontaneous state is "post rational," not irrational. A striking difference between the Stoic and Daoist ideals of living with nature emerges from the above description: the Stoic ideal is rational, while the Daoist one is what I call "post-rational." For the Stoics, ratio nality is the sole source of human happiness. To live in agreement with nature means to live according to reason, and to perfect one's rationality</page><page sequence="8">8 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY in contemplation of the order of nature. This is why the Stoic Diogenes says living with nature is "to be reasonable in the selection and rejection of natural things," and Antipater claims it is "to live invariably selecting natural things and rejecting unnatural things."40 Yet for Daoism, "selec tion and rejection" are precisely what should be abandoned. A natural life, embodied in the sage, is to "learn not to learn" (Laozi, chap. 64) or to "exterminate learning" (Laozi, chap. 20). "In pursuit of wisdom, one adds everyday. In pursuit o? dao, one decreases every day" (Laozi, chap. 48). This is meant to abolish intellectual learning, cognitive knowledge, and distinction-making reasoning. Since the natural state is based on the awareness of the limits of conceptual knowledge, the more one pur sues it, the farther he is from dao. We need to abolish knowledge-based social guidance to restore the original spontaneous state. As a result, although both Daoist and Stoic ethics claim that living with nature is the virtuous life, and both even commonly relate virtue to nature,41 they differ sharply about what the virtuous life is. For the Sto ics, virtue (excellence) is the perfection of one's rationality, a developed rational attitude or disposition that is in harmony with the divine reason, and the knowledge of the order and structure of nature. The acquisition of virtue is a matter of grasping the life-governing knowledge. For the Daoists, virtue is the embodiment of dao in each individual thing and "what gives each its individual character."42 The highest virtue (de) is wu-wei (non-action; Laozi, chap. 38), and it comes through getting rid of the influences of socialization and intellectualization. How do we account for this striking difference? First, their concep tions of the natural life are, to a great extent, shaped by the respective ethical traditions in which they were developed. Stoicism is in Greek tradition of eudaimonism, according to which happiness is the ultimate end of human life. A history of Greek ethics is a history of disputes about what constitutes happiness and how to achieve it. The dominant approach has been to focus on human rationality and its excellence (vir tue). Socrates claims that virtue is knowledge. Plato identifies human function (ergon), or what is characteristically human, with rational soul (Republic 1, 353d). Aristotle takes it to be rational human activity (NE. 1098a2-3) and holds that contemplation, the exercise of pure rationality, is primary happiness. "Living in agreement with nature" is precisely the Stoic answer to the question of what happiness is. In providing this answer, the Stoics inherit the Greek emphasis on rationality, and pro ceed to ground it in the cosmic rationality.43 This becomes their specific contribution to the rational eudaimonism. Daoism is one of the so called "hundred schools" that dispute about which dao should guide human life and social order. Just as Greek</page><page sequence="9">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 9 ethicists agree that the ultimate end is eudaimonia, but differ about what eudaimonia is, Chinese philosophers agree that the common goal is to find and establish the Heaven-based human dao, but about what the dao is. Daoism criticizes the endless debates among many conflict ing daos such as Confucianism and Mohism, and therefore develops a meta-philosophical position to the effect that all ethical theories are equal and that there is no universal and objective criterion by which to judge and rank them. The transformational natural state (ziran) of the world is employed to support this meta-philosophical reflection about the instability of any positive guidance. The second point is that Daoism and Stoicism have different ideas of what the true human nature is. The Stoics, just as their predecessors in Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, have a firm belief that the distinct human nature and the true human self is rationality. The Daoists know well that the characteristic of being a human (qing) is rational: "Judging 'that's it, that's not' is what I mean by 'the qing of man."'44 Graham renders qing as "what is essentially (qing) of man."45I tend to think qing corresponds to the notion of ergon (human function or what is characteristically hu man) in Plato and Aristotle.46 Contrary to the Stoic (and dominant Greek) belief that rationality is the ground of human ethics, Daoism holds that instead of fulfilling one's rational nature ("what is essentially of man"), one should repudi ate it. In Zhuangzi's explanation, "What I mean by being without the essentials is that the man does not inwardly wound his person by likes and dislikes, that he constantly goes by the spontaneous (ziran) and does not add anything to the process of life."47 Discriminative reasoning mars our original natural state by establishing artificial guidance, and it prevents us from returning to our true nature. As mentioned earlier, whereas the Stoics believe that human beings enjoy a privileged posi tion in the universe, the Daoists refuse to think such a distinct position as a valuable thing. Living with Nature and Living in Community Zhuangzi uses Confucius as a mouthpiece to illustrate the difference between Daoism and Confucianism. "They travel in the transcendental world, and I travel in the mundane world. There is nothing common between the two worlds."48 The mundane world is the regulated human community. Now we cannot help but ask: how does a Daoist live in the mundane world? The same question can be asked of a Stoic: how does he deal with human relationships and material goods? What is at issue here is the relation between their respective conception of living with nature and their communal life.</page><page sequence="10">10 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Neither Daoism nor Stoicism provides much positive guidance about how we ought to act in society. The description of what living with nature amounts to is very thin in both ethics. Daoist readers are often puzzled about how in our ethical life we can practice the ideas o? wu-wei (non-action), spontaneity, self-transformation, or sitting and forgetting. The same perplexity extends to Stoicism as well. Cosmic rationality is apparently a basic principle, and living with nature means to model our life on this cosmic rationality. Yet it is unclear what its content is. They also state that living with nature means "being active in no way usually forbidden by the law common to all, which is the right reason." Yet Stoics never specify what this common law (koinos nomos) is,49 but only emphasize rational consistency, agreement and harmony. Nevertheless, Daoist spontaneity and Stoic rational consistency lead to one common life attitude, that is, indifference towards the usually held goods or bad. Different from Aristotle but close to Socrates, the Stoics hold that virtue alone is good and is sufficient for happiness. As long as one is virtuous and fulfills what is within his power as a rational agent, he is happy. In contrast, all of the usually recognized goods such as life, heath, pleasure, beauty, wealth, and all of the usually recognized bad things such as death, disease, pain, ugliness, poverty are "indiff?rents" (adiaphora). The term "indifferent" in Stoicism means mainly "those things which do not contribute to happiness or unhappiness."50 Of the indifferent things, the Stoics distinguish between "preferred" and "non-preferred, which we shall discuss shortly. Indifferent things are neither beneficial nor harmful. To these things that make no difference to happiness, one should react with indifference. What matters is to concentrate on one's true self, i.e., rationality. Daoism also holds an attitude of indifference, claiming that one should not be disturbed by external things and events. "The thing to do is to leave it to a self-transformation."51 Everything is in the process of transformation, and this natural process is inevitable. A Daoist should be completely indifferent to everything outside him.52 Neither Daoism nor Stoicism requires one to withdraw from social life completely, and Stoicism even thinks that sociality is present in our original constitution. Yet the attitude of indifference that both ethics share results, for both of them, in a life of detachment from social and conventional values. Consequently, despite their different conceptions of living with nature, a Daoist and a Stoic appear to behave similarly in actual social life. Let me specify how this attitude of detachment is shown in some key aspects of life.</page><page sequence="11">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 11 (a) Family and Friends We mentioned earlier that Stoics call the things that make no difference to happiness "indiff?rents." Of the indiff?rents, the Stoics distinguish between those that are "preferred" (pro?gmena) and those that are "non preferred (apopro?gmena)."53 The preferred indiff?rents are things that accord with human nature and contribute to human self-preservation. They include the commonly recognized good things which are typically appropriate or congenial (oikeion) to our nature, and they are what Aristotle calls "external goods." Thus, other things being equal, it is preferable to have health rather than sickness. Families and friendship, according to the Stoics, are all consistent with human nature and hence are preferred indiff?rents. They have selective values (axia eklektik?), but are still indiff?rents and should make no difference to our happi ness. Following the Stoics principles, if a sage comes home and finds that his house is burning and his child inside, he will do his best to save the child. Yet if the child is not saved, the Stoic will not feel sorrow or regret.54 The sage loves his friends, but should "not be entirely swept along by another's grief."55 There is no point in feeling sorrow. Similarly, Daoism acknowledges that family is important and friend ship is valuable. Yet they are not a part of the life of nature (ziran). Analogous to the dao of heaven, the sage is not benevolent, but treats everything as straw dogs (Laozi, chap. 5). Straw dogs are the objects of sacrifice that are burned to appease the spirits, and are destroyed when they are used. To treat something as a straw dog means that individual things are ultimately "sacrificed" to dao and the meaning of the part comes from its function within the whole. Zhuangzi even draws a gen eral contrast between dao and love: "The reason why dao is flawed is the reason why love becomes complete."56 This is because love involves partiality, whereas dao does not admit any distinction. Hence, like Sto icism, Daoism insists that one should not feel sadness over the death of their friends and family members. A person named Meng Suncai did not show real sorrow when his mother died. While this is the lack of virtue of filial piety for Confucianism, Zhuangzi understands that Meng Suncai is in accordance with nature. "He does not prefer the one or the other. He lets himself be transformed into whatever it may be, and wait for further transformation which are not yet known."57 When Zhuangzi's own wife was dead, Huizi went to offer condolence. "He found Zhuangzi squatting on the ground and singing, beating on an earthen bowl."58 When Huizi condemned him for behaving that way, Zhuangzi replied that in death his wife joins in the process of transformation, and that is something to be celebrated. Sanghu, Meng Zifan, and Qinzhang were friends. When Sanghu died and was about to be buried, Confucius sent his disciple Zigong to pay condolence. Yet Zigong found that of Sanghu's</page><page sequence="12">12 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY two friends, one "was plaiting frames for silkworms, the other playing the zither, and they sang together to celebrate that Sanghu returns to "being what one truly is."59 (b) Misfortunes and Death Compare these two passages: 1. "Indifferent are things like this: life and death, good and bad repu tation, pleasure and pain, wealth and poverty, health and disease, and things similar to these." 2."Death and life, survival and ruin, success and failure, poverty and riches, competence and incompetence, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, these are the mutations of affairs, the course of destiny. . . . Consequently there is no point in letting them disturb one's peace." The first is the Stoic view60 and the second is the Daoist.61 These two passages are so similar that if the source of reference were removed we might have no idea which school they are from. For both, fortunes and misfortunes are indifferent. The Stoic sage is utterly immune, since for him virtue is sufficient for happiness. Epictetus was once a slave. Yet, for him, although freedom is preferable, slavery and freedom are indiff?rents. The inner chapters of the Zhuangzi show numerous people who suffer serious bodily deformity. Yet they are not bothered by their conditions or the demeaning judgment of others, but remain harmonious. A person with a chopped foot "regards losing his own foot as he would shaking off mud,"62 for the reason that "What gave the foot its worth still survives in me, which is why I am concerned to keep it intact."63 This kind of person is said to display "signs of fullness of virtue [de] ."64 There is, however, a difference. The Stoic sage understands that what is happening is providentially ordered and a part of the predetermined destiny. Even if what is happening is a disaster for the individual, he would take it as advantageous to the whole on the belief that he has a pre-ordained role to play in the world. "He would even collaborate with disease and death and lameness, aware that these things are dispensed by the arrangement of the whole."65 In other words, he is not only pre pared to accept any calamity, but to accept it contentedly, regarding it as something that contributes to the larger perfection of the universe.66 In contrast, while Daoism believes in fate or destiny?that is, the inevi tability of the natural process?it does not have the providential notion.67 Hence, while a Daost takes it that fortunes and misfortunes, life and death, are all in the course of destiny and that human beings should accept their naturalness without complaint, he does not have the idea that he should accept it with satisfaction.</page><page sequence="13">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 13 Sometimes both Daosim and Stoicism are accused of being inconsid erate, insensitive and even inhuman, because they both regard living with nature (as each understands it) as the only good, and treat what happens to their family and friends as things that are indifferent or in the process of natural transformation. These views are apparently at odds with common sense.68 Nevertheless, neither of these two views can be said to be advocating immorality. They are concerned with our whole life rather than the reduced area of life that our sense of morality covers. Neither is egoistic, in the pejorative sense of seeking to satisfy one's desire at the expense of others' interests. The goal of a Daoist is to get rid of the ego and join the process of transformation of the universe. Indeed, it is precisely the idea of detachment that grants both schools great therapeutic value. Both encourage people to be indifferent towards the gain or loss of external fortune, give people psychological fortitude and strength in times of distress and calamity, and encourage people to concentrate on the inner self and seek spiritual freedom. The above discussion leads to the following question: If Stoic and Dao ist ideas of living with nature are so different, how can their attitudes about living in society be so alike? First, no matter what their respective conceptions of nature are, both schools commonly hold the position that the good is not determined by conventional social values. The Daoist spontaneous life is based on abandoning existing value systems, and such a life does not "take the trouble to observe the rules of propriety of popular society in order to impress the multitude."69 For the Stoic, the natural and rational life is not necessarily in contrast to social values; yet it is not conditioned by social values either (in the way that, say, the Aristotelian life of practical wisdom is shaped by social habituation). In Stoicism the ultimate stan dard of goodness and happiness is harmony with the will of Zeus. Zeno, for example, is clearly a critic of existing social values. He advocates a community of wives, rejects the educational curriculum, and argues against public buildings including temples. He also suggests abolishing currency,70 and his ideal society differs sharply from existing ones. His idea that all men are fellow citizens of the cosmos and follow only one law71 implies an indifference towards the laws and constitutions of any particular state. The later Stoics are much less radical and try to adjust to normal social institutions; yet for them the ultimate standards are natural laws, not social norms. Apparently, both schools are sharply in contrast to Aristotle, who claims that virtue of character is based on social ethos (habit, custom) and is acquired through habituation,72 and also to Confucius, who believes that virtue is based on ritual and is acquired through the process of ritualization.</page><page sequence="14">14 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Second, both Stoic and Daoist ideals are devoid of emotional involve ment. Daoism, together with non-action (wu-wei), advocates "no-desire" (Laozi, chaps. 37, 57). Here desire (yu) includes appetites and passions. "No-desire" does not mean that there is no desire. Rather, it means that one is not disturbed by desires and is indifferent towards external events. The Stoics think that the soul is unitary, and refuse to accept the idea of psychological conflict. For them, emotions are simply false judgment that may be corrected by more rational judgments,73 or excessive impulses which are "disobedient to the reason," or the "irrational and unnatural movements of a soul."74 In short, emotion is by definition bad or violent. The Stoics sage is free from passions (apatheia) and he is happy because he is not manipulated and drawn by such irrational forces. Zeno defines happiness as "a smooth flow of life."75 Similarly, Daoism likens the natural life to water. Both can conceive of the best life in this way because both advocate the transcendence of conventional moral ity and the elimination of passion as an ethical motive. Although they have radical differences about what nature to emulate and about how to live with nature, these differences appear to have provided alternative reasons for the detachment from social values and passion.76 State University of New York at Buffalo and Renmin University of China NOTES 1.

Nevertheless, if we relate this statement to Laozi chap. 25, Zhuangzi is consistent with Laozi. For human beings live with Heaven, yet Heaven itself emulates ziran. 5.

The works of the three Greek Stoic masters (Zeno of Citium, c. 344-262 be; Cleanthes, 331-232 be; and Chrysippus, c. 280-207 be) are fragmentary, and information about them is defective. Furthermore, the views are not always the same between the Greek Stoics and the Roman Stoics (Seneca, 4 bc-ad 65; Epictetus, c. 55-135; Marcus Aurelius, 121-189), and even within each genera tion. The two central texts of Daoism are Daodejing (or Laozi) and Zhuangzi. Yet the former is full of controversies about its date, versions, author, and its goal. The latter has thirty-three chapters, but traditionally only the inner chapters (the first seven chapters) are thought to be authentic, and these chapters are notoriously difficult to interpret. Furthermore, although these two classics are the same in their fundamental spirit, they have differences. 9. DL; IG, 11-94, 191; cf. also Cicero, LS, 57-F, 348.

Oikei?sis does not have a natural equivalent in English. It is an agent's natural disposition to recognize something as its own, and is in contrast to "alienation." IG renders it as "congeniality," while LS translates it as "appro priation." For a helpful discussion of this term, see LS, p.351. With oikei?sis as the starting-point of their ethical theory, Stoics are in contrast to the Epicurean view that the primary impulse of animals is to seek pleasure. 25. DL, IG, 11-94, 196. LS translates this term as "proper function" and explains that "it picks out a particular action or activity, the ethical grounding of which, in the case of humans, is 'reason,' but not necessarily 'right' reason, the foundation of'right actions'" (LS, 365). 26.

("Following Nature: A Study in Stoic Ethics," in her Essays on Hellenistic Epistemology and Ethics [Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, 1996], pp. 226-227). 29.

While it is common to use ziran and wuwei interchangeably, Liu Xiaogan seeks to distinguish between then to the effect that "Naturalness is the core value of the thought of Laozi, while wuwei is the principle or method for realizing</page><page sequence="17">LIVING WITH NATURE: STOICISM AND DAOISM 17 this value in action."

The problem is that wu-wei is also said to be a state o? dao. "The way never acts [wu-wei] yet noth ing is left undone" (Laozi, chap. 37). However, I agree that wu-wei is especially suggestive in describing how zhiran is embodied in human life. 36. Zhuangzi, chap. 2; Graham, Chuang-Tzu, p. 52. 37.

(DL, IG, 11-94,191) For Daoism, "by cultivating one's nature one will return to virtue. When virtue is perfect, one will be one with the beginning" (Zhuangzi, chap. 12; Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 202). 42 Zhuangzi, 12; Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 202. 43. Nietzsche rightly points out that Stoicism creates the nature in its own image: "Your pride wants to dictate and annex your morals and ideals onto nature?yes, nature itself?you demand that it be nature 'according to Stoa' and you want to make all existence exist in your own image alone?as a huge eternal glorification and universalization of Stoicism!"

In modern Chinese qing means "emotion" or "passion." Yet Graham argued that the term qing in pre-Han literature does not usually mean "pas sion," but means, as a noun, "fact," and as an adjective, "genuine." "The qing of X is what makes it a genuine X, what every X has and without which would not be an X; in this usage qing is surprisingly close to the Aristotelian 'es sence.'" Graham, "The Background of the Mencian Theory of Human Nature," in his Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990), p. 60. The recently recovered Guaodian texts, however, have shown that qing defined as emotions play a central role in the earliest Confucian texts. Nevertheless, in the usage of Zhuangzi (quoted above) qing cannot be "passion," but appears to be close to Graham's interpretation. I also discussed this term in Jiyuan Yu, Ethics of Confucius and Aristotle: Mirrors of Virtue (London: Routledge, 2007), chap. 2, n. 7. 46. Mencius also employs the notion of qing to explain the originally good nature of human beings which distinguishes them from other animals: "As far as his qing is concerned, a man is capable of becoming good," says Mencius, "that is what I mean by good" (Mencius, 6a/6). 47.

It is reported that Zeno's formulation of the goal of life is "living in agreement," and it is actually Cleanthes who thinks that this formulation is too narrow, and so adds "with nature" to it (Stobaeus; IG, 11-95, 211). But this report cannot be correct, giving that "living in agreement with nature" means precisely "living consistently." There is no difference between Zeno's formula tion and Cleanthes'. According to Malcolm Schofield, "with a little ingenuity, the Greek expression 'consistently' (homologoumen?s) can be dismantled into a telegrammatic version of 'in accordance with one concordant reason."' "Stoic Ethics," in The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics, ed. Brad Inwood (Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 241. 50. DL; IG, 11-94,104. There is another sense of "indiff?rents," which refers to the things that that have nothing to do with ethics, such as whether the number of hairs on one's head is odd or even. 51. Zhuangzi, 17; Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, p. 206. 52. "To get life is to be on time and to lose it is to be on course; be content with the time and settled on the course, and sadness and joy cannot find a way in" (Zhuangzi, chap. 6, Graham, Chuang-Tzu, p. 88). 53. DL, IG, 11-94, 196. Zeno is said to be the first to draw this distinction. However, although it can be fairly said to be the orthodox Stoic position, not all Stoics agree to it. Aristo of Chios held that "without exception things indifferent as between virtue and vice have no difference at all" (LS, 58F and G). For a helpful discussion, see Striker, "Following Nature," ?2. The distinction between "the good" (i.e., virtue) and "the preferable" is also criticized by the Academic philosopher Antiochus of Ascalon to be an invalid and incoherent one. Indeed, there has been a scholarly debate about whether the Stoics could consistently have held external goods as completely irrelevant to happiness. 54. This case is reconstructed in A. A. Long, Hellenistic Philosophy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986, second edition), pp. 197-198. 55. Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations, trans. G. M. A. Grube, V.36. 56.

But they would be better off forgetting each other in the Yangzi or the lakes" (Zhuangzi, chap. 6; Graham, Chuang-Tzu, p. 90).
