CAREY* University of Central Florida JOSEPH LOPREATO University of Texas at Austin ABSTRACT: The article begins by underscoring the widely noted "sociological crisis" and the message from the history of science that the crisis may be susceptible to resolution through an application of a general law pertaining to a neighboring science (sociobiology in our case). From here, the article proceeds to pinpoint the basic argument of Professor Crippen's article (this issue) and then critically examines the two articles that critically accompany it. We find some errors of interpretation in Professor Maryanski's article, but on the whole it is a constructive critique of Crippen's essay and a related invitation to a biologically informed evolutionary sociology. By contrast, Professor Freese's intenninable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and in the process offers a tortuous, tendentious itinerary of politically correct interpretations of scientific inquiry in general and sociobiological science in particular. For those keen to the intellectual culture that motivated eighteenth- and nineteenth- century students of "natural history," sociology is as much an immanent repercussion of the Copemican Revolution as are geology, quantum mechanics, chemistry, evolutionary biology, and any of the other scientific disciplines that in recent times have enlightened the inquisitive and unprepossessed mind. The degree to which sociologists are prepared to establish credentials worthy of this context is a different matter. Indeed, some sociologists, mistaking the nature of science, assert that the deed is impossible and any effort toward it would be pernicious to our human uniqueness. One foil of the naysayers, increasingly common in these times of "postmodemism" and "political correctness," is the quixotic charge that "Truth" is an affirmation of power and privilege. Sciences, however, are mere programs of inquiry directed at discovering uniformities of recurring observations and some of their inductive and deductive appurtenants. As such, they are more adept at detecting errors than at affirming * Direct all correspondence to: Arlen D.

Witness, for example, the quick challenges to claims of "cold fusion" and of the solution of Fermat's last theorem. As a result, sciences are ever subject to modification and, as they alter, so does the truthfulness of established uniformities. The Newtonian view of the universe, for instance, is hardly sterile of knowledge. Yet, it does not square with certain subsequent observations, say, with the 'lumpiness" of the universe, or with the Einsteinean view that the force of gravity is "really" an effect of the curvature of four-dimensional spacetime. Likewise, as far as the cosmologist is concerned, the "big bang" theory merely claims a set of hypotheses that fit certain recurring, falsifiable observations and employ a language that is denotatively understood by all who share a tutored interest in those observations. Else, one would hardly expect an astronomer to state that "the universe is mathematical." The theory does not-cannot-deny that the big bang may have had a Creator behind it. As zoologist E.O. Wilson (1978b:205) has noted, "God remains a viable hypothesis as the prime mover, however undefinable and untestable that conception may be." Claims of Truth may be an affliction of some scientists, or more likely of scientistic debunkers, but certainly not of science. There is another aspect of sciences that is particularly noteworthy. Their practitioners are inclined to compete for "turf," especially during periods of theoretical infancy. At such times, they often suffer from the neophobia that frequently attends the weltanschauung of "campanile horizons." To an extent, both geology and biology, for instance, seem to have had such an experience in the nineteenth century, both in relation to each other and in relation to older scientific disciplines (Bowlby 1990). It is equally true, however, that as disciplines attain sufficient success to be self- confident about their weaknesses as well as their strengths, interdisciplinary activity and cross-fertilization inevitably ensue. This appears to be a basic message of the history of science. There are no impregnable boundaries between turfs. Moreover, some hypotheses (laws, etc.) have greater "explanatory" reach than others and, hence, are more efficient organizers of "cumulative knowledge." Indeed, the history of science appears to show that disciplines tend to achieve, at best, descriptive status till such time as they borrow at least one general principle or law from a neighboring, more established, science (e.g., Braithwaite 1953; Kuhn 1957). Though born in the family of sciences, sociology has heretofore fared rather poorly in the activities of the kin. Now nearing its bicentennial as an official discipline, it has not developed a recognizable body of systematic (logically organized) knowledge. Nor, unlike anthropology and psychology, does it show much readiness to enter interdisciplinary discourse with more established sciences of behavior. Furthermore, it reveals the sort of dissent that suggests not multiformity and vitality but elementary deficiencies, rampant bickering, and debilitating disorientation. Consider. For nearly half a century, the "functionalism" of Talcott Parsons and Robert K. Merton represented for many a sociologist the cornerstone of a sociological core. Still, it engendered intemecine logomachies and</page><page sequence="3">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 405 confusion as to what it amounted to and to what use might best be made of it (e.g., Turner and Maryanski 1988). Today, it is hard to see what remains of functionalism, whatever it was. Nor have alternative sociologies fared any better. We do have theoretical self-identifications among sociologists (e.g., Sanderson and Ellis 1992), but it is the substance of the identification that is elusive. In retrospect, it appears that we have been all along on the wrong path, but either unable or unwilling to try a new compass. We are led to recall a verdict, by a philosopher of science, on Parsons's "general theory of action": "Perhaps this shows how close Parsons has remained to the wisdom of the hoi polloi" (Black 1961:279). Yet, decades later, two sociologists, rightly decrying the poor state of affairs in theoretical sociology, reiterated an earlier assertion to the effect that "there is no longer a theoretical core such as Parsons provided in the bygone postwar era" (Gerstein and Sciulli 1987:2). Attempts at syntheses of sorts, and therefore at core formation, whether directed at general sociology or at crucial aspects of it, have not been missing (e.g., Lenski 1966: especially chs. 2-4, 13; Turner 1984). But, as the above reference to core suggests, sociologists' conception of theoretical cores implies a structure made of flesh and bones. Accordingly, some names constitute "cores"; others do not. It may follow, therefore, that dead Parsons, dead the core! Imagine, for a fair glimpse of our ailment, the death of Newtonian science around 1727! Pierre van den Berghe (1990) has recently leveled the charge of "trained incompetence" at sociologists. Is the doctor wicked? Wrong? Right? Consider again. Nearly half a century ago, Robert K. Merton (1948), taking stock of sociological progress, wrote that much of what passed for sociological theory consisted of anything but "verifiable statements of relationships between specified variables." "We have many approaches," he pointed out, "but few conclusions." Among the alleged causes of this unfortunate condition, were "grand theorizing"; its opposite, the raw empiricism of "miscellaneous facts"; and our perennial affliction: the disjunction between theory and method (see also Merton 1968). Grand theorizing, the least of our problems, is no more, if it ever was. The other two ills, far more grievous, have been more unremitting. Thus, four decades after Merton's diagnosis, Gerhard Lenski could argue, in a lead paper of American sociology's flagship, that "macrosociological theories" (read "sociological theories") fall short on at least two basic criteria: (1) they are rarely if ever falsifiable; (2) they 'lack substantive conceptual links to established theories in other scientific disciplines." As a result, "theory has not advanced nearly so much as it has proliferated" (Lenski 1988:165). Some of the solutions proposed by this scholar startle no one. We are enjoined, for instance, to specify our constants and to develop "multilayered theories" under the guidance of "covering" general principles. Other suggestions are downright embarrassing, though equally necessary: (1) define variables in an "operationally unambiguous manner," and (2) specify relationships among and between variables unambiguously. Are we, then, justified in throwing a fit when an occasional statement in the public media makes bold to represent our own unavoidable self-representations (e.g., Kantrowite 1992)? The brief article</page><page sequence="4">406 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 in Newsweek alluded to here pointed to some unpleasant facts: for example, the budgetary pressures on many a sociology department, some of which have folded or are threatened toward this end; the large reduction of Sociology concentrators in the last two decades; the almost total lack of communication between "the quantifiers" and "the thinkers"; and, of course, the common grumbling that "the subjects are often trivial and ... jargon has overtaken thought." Currently, the disorientation of sociology is being underscored by a growing horde of naysayers who call themselves "postmodemists" and typically adhere to the dogmas of political correctness. As we shall see, one of Professor Crippen's critics has strong sympathies for postmodemism and seems to be afflicted by such an extreme case of political correctness that for him even scientific laws may bear the sin of political incorrectness. Still, postmodemists are justified in pointing to the "intellectual insularity" of sociology and "the almost permanent sense of crisis and malaise that surrounds contemporary sociological theory," though they hardly help the cause by calling for "social theories" impregnated with "moral" intent (e.g., Seidman 1991:131-132). Certainly, it is hard to find fault with the following statement (Seidman 1991:133): Instead of a concentrated, productive discourse focused on a limited set of problems that exhibits sustained elaboration, we find a dispersed, discursive clamoring that covers a wide assortment of ever-changing issues in a dazzling diversity of languages. Again, (Seidman 1991:133): "There is a virtual babble of different vocabularies addressing a heterogeneous cluster of changing disputes." On the other hand, it is astonishing to read that: "The claim to truth, as Foucault has proposed, is inextricably an act of power-a will to form humanity. This epistemic suspicion is at the core of postmodemism" (Seidman 1991:134-135). As we shall see, the suspicion, ill-founded, drives much of Freese's criticism of Crippen's article and of human sociobiology. PROFESSOR CRIPPEN'S SENSIBLE APPEAL Given the current state of affairs in sociology, Timothy Crippen's argument deserves a somber, even if unsympathetic, hearing. But, as we shall see, that was not to be, at least as far as one of the critics (Freese 1994, this issue) is concemed. As a minimum, Crippen's article is a reminder to sociologists that Darwinian- Mendelian science (the Modem Synthesis-Huxley 1942; Simpson [1949] 1967; Dobzhansky et al. 1977) continues to expand at a swift pace, and in the process to forge mutually edifying alliances with the human behavioral sciences. Anyone reading the various journals specializing in evolutionary human issues can hardly avoid noting the productive dialogue currently at work, especially among zoologists, anthropologists, psychologists, philosophers, and students of law, among others. The periodical publication of lists of current "sociobiology" books</page><page sequence="5">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 407 and articles in the newsletters of the European Sociobiological Society, the International Society for Human Ethology, and the Gruter Institute, among others, provides a clear indication of the growing rapprochement now taking place especially between evolutionary biology and the two social sciences, anthropology and psychology, that most actively compete with sociology for the appropriation of domain subject matter. With very few exceptions, sociologists have been either unwilling or unable to participate in this interdisciplinary dialogue, and show every indication of wanting to be left out of it (Sanderson and Ellis 1992). Such aloofness is dangerous to the future health of our discipline for two major reasons. First, in some areas of study- for example, family issues, group confficts, gender roles, and "social values" (ethics)-sociology is being cannibalized by zoology and philosophy as well as the aforementioned sister disciplines to such an extent that it runs the risk of becoming obsolete. Second, our insularity means that on campus and in university committees, we have neither friends nor colleagues in the strict sense required by academic survival. What Crippen is saying is that the time has come for sociology to compete and, one would hope, to flourish. "Theory refinement" in sociology, states Crippen, "may be enhanced by incorporating explanatory principles conventionally employed in the evolutionary behavioral sciences." He may be wrong, but, as Professor Maryanski happily notes (1994, this issue), sociologists must "consider a more open scientific attitude towards biological arguments, even if only to reject them once again." Crippen argues, along with many another scholar, that a science of human behavior is not possible without at least one general law or principle, namely, a broad hypothesis that contains the rationale for a rich program of logical inferences and derivatives. This has been missing, or is hidden, in sociology. Without such a statement of theory, it is not even possible to define our concepts unambiguously and to state relationships among variables unambiguously. It is general laws, furthermore, that make it possible to transform a melange of "miscellaneous facts" into a body of cumulative, "verified" knowledge. Crippen proposes that, in the absence of a homegrown general principle, sociologists put to the test a general principle of evolutionary biology, and in the process possibly upgrade the principle with appropriate provisions dictated by sociocultural findings. The principle, sometimes termed the "maximization principle," can be stated in various, related forms, just as, for example, the laws of thermodynamics can. Basically, it states that organisms, humans included, have evolved a tendency to so behave as to maximize the chances of conveying their genotype to future generations. A "tendency" is better than nothing in a law, but, as Crippen as well as historians and philosophers of science have noted (e.g., Kuhn 1957; Popper 1959; Nagel 1961: especially ch. 13; Ruse 1979; see also Lopreato and Alston 1970; Lopreato 1989), it is also a bit "lazy" as heuristic devices go. Laws stated in the form of theoretical idealizations, or approximations thereof (e.g., contingent laws) are typically more heuristically powerful because they urgently invite the mind to come up with</page><page sequence="6">408 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 explanations of phenomena that depart from the hypothesized rule, and/or account for specified contingencies (e.g., Nagel 1961; Lopreato and Alston 1970). The result is an accumulation of statements of theory. Laws that are accompanied by contingencies thus function as especially effective focal points of research for the development of cumulative, "verified" knowledge, i.e., scientific theories properly speaking. Clearly, that is what is needed in sociology if we are to justify our continuing inclusion in the family of academic disciplines. "My own feeling," to put it in the words of James Coleman as quoted in Newsweek (Kantrowite 1992), is that "it's extremely important for sociology to demonstrate its utility to society if it's going to be viable in the long run." If sociology remains insular, it cannot be viable. An unmistakable message coming out of scientific research today is that nature knows no boundaries-that all sciences are to varying degrees related fields of inquiry. In many respects, astronomy, physics, geology, chemistry, and biology are as different from one another as any social science is from biology. Yet, to a considerable extent, they have developed, through various stages, in a state of mutual dependence. For instance, evolutionary ecology borrows the Entropy Law from physics; physics borrows the hypothesis of "neogenesis" from cellular biology (Rush 1957; Pattee 1973). Examples are legion. Some 330 years ago, for instance, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens discovered that two pendulum clocks (his invention) hanging side by side on a wall would achieve perfect synchrony in their oscillations within 30 minutes. The theory of "coupled oscillators" was bom. In the course of time, and increasingly in the last three decades, mathematicians and scientists have discovered that coupled oscillators can be found throughout nature. They include neural networks in the brain that control breathing and chewing, pacemaker cells in the heart, insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas, the unison chirping of crickets, the flashing of fireflies in certain areas of the world, and, among many others, the symmetries of animal gaits, including human, such as pacing and galloping (plus, most likely, such phenomena as chanting, human waves in stadiums, and the oft-remarked synchronization of menstruation among humans living in close proximity). But the most remarkable fact about discoveries of this sort is that they are the result of cooperation among such seemingly disparate fields of endeavor as mathematics, mathematical biology, neurobiology, medicine, ecology, computer graphics, entomology, statistical mechanics, and plasma physics (e.g., Winfree 1987; Collins and Stewart 1993). The day when a sociologist can go out and ask a few often vacuous questions of a sample of people, or worse, borrow such questions from a pollster, and then proceed from there to do science, is rapidly approaching the last midnight. From Evolutionary Biology to Evolutionary Behavioral Science: A Brief Sketch Before turning to Crippen's critics, it may be helpful to review briefly a few basic aspects of evolutionary behavioral science (sociobiology) that have laid claim to the theoretical attention of sociologists. One of our aims is to underscore the</page><page sequence="7">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 409 fundamental breakthrough that the maximization principle represents for evolutionary science in general and for behavioral science in particular. We must begin by stating that C. Darwin's "natural selection" was born ambiguous and so, to an extent, it continues to be. Darwin's difficulty with his famous "mechanism" is not hard to conjecture. He was far more comfortable as a geologist than as a biologist (e.g., Bowlby 1990). Further, while a reasonable grasp of evolution as a fact had been available for at least some 50 years before Darwin, the race in his own time was for the discovery of the uniform cause, now known as the general "mechanism," of evolution. Being in no position to adequately grasp the evolutionary significance of what he termed "variations" (subsequently known as genes), he rather stumbled into "natural selection" as the pacemaker of speciation (evolution). In this conclusion, he was guided by his prodigious field observations, his knowledge of geologist Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism, and the "brainstorm" he allegedly experienced while reading Malthus's argument that populations tend to grow beyond the means of self-sustenance, and hence are faced with a real or virtual struggle for scarce resources. The scarcity and the struggle tended to keep population growth in check, for individuals varied constitutionally in their capacity to succeed, survive, and reproduce. They also accounted for the ecological specialization of populations (species) as individuals, and groups thereof, adapted to open niches in their environment. Natural selection-or the differential success of the variations in facilitating survival and reproduction-thus appeared to explain the tendency toward demographic equilibria along with Darwin's observations of what was later termed "horizontal evolution," for example, the appearance of related but specialized species in varying ecosystems across migration spaces. It bears stressing, however, that, while Darwin was not entirely clear about the theoretical status of natural selection in his conceptualization of speciation, he ([1859] 1958:88, our emphasis) categorically rejected natural selection as a cause of evolution: "Some have even imagined that natural selection induces variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such variations as arise and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life." It was, therefore, a gross error when, around 1930, the English-speaking "synthesizers" wedded Darwinism with Mendelism on the general proposition that "all biological organization, down to the level of molecules, has evolved as a result of natural selection acting upon genetic variation" (Dobzhansky et al. 1977:18, emphasis in original). This astonishing statement was perhaps intended as a working metaphor to facilitate the politics of rapprochement between two previously separate and self-centered branches of biology. As metaphor, if carefully employed, it does no harm. To this day, however, one finds numberless statements claiming that natural selection acts on, explains, or causes, some fact or other. Technically, they are erroneous. Natural selection refers rather to a demographic process and, as such, it is effect rather than cause. Evolution results from the interdependence of variations (genotype) and environment. This interdependence is normally referred to as "adaptation" (Simpson [1949] 1967). The demographic</page><page sequence="8">410 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3, 1994 result of continual differential adaptation in a breeding population may be referred to as natural selection. Accordingly, to the extent that we are, for example, interested in explaining behavior (as an aspect of phenotype), we have to have some understanding of genetic causes, on the one hand, and of environmental ones, on the other. Darwin ([1859] 1958:ch. III) himself was aware of the fact. Thus, a chapter on natural selection is preceded by the chapter on the "struggle for existence," which was intended "to show how the struggle for existence bears on Natural Selection" (Darwin [1859] 1958:73). The demonstration is made in thoroughly Malthusian fashion in a section on the "Nature of the Checks to increase" (Darwin [1859] 1958:78-80). Put simply, natural selection "depends" on the struggle for existence, in the sense that the latter tends to check population growth beyond the means of subsistence by being partial cause of differential survival and reproduction. The term "sociobiology," which according to E. 0. Wilson (1978a:3) first appeared in 1946, marks the stage in the Modern Synthesis when "the struggle for existence," which unequivocally bears behavioral payload, was redeemed from the obscurity into which it had fallen in scientific circles (though, alas, not in the pestilent circles of "social Darwinists"). In 1950, John P. Scott, the then-secretary of the influential Committee for the Study of Animal Behavior, officially proposed "sociobiology" as a term for the "interdisciplinary science which lies between the fields of biology (particularly ecology and physiology) and psychology and sociology" (Scott 1950). (How many invitations to scholarly cooperation and regard have sociologists rejected from biology! See also Wilson 1975:ch. 27.) By the end of the next quarter of a century, when E.O. Wilson (1975) published his now-renowned treatise, the so-called maximization principle had become the theoretical cornerstone ("enshrinement," according to Mr. Freese's theology) of sociobiology. Whatever its shortcomings, by restoring the basis of natural selection, it has also introduced causality into behavioral Darwinism, and hence some basis for nomothetic explanation. Specifically, it directs causal attention to genetic traits and their synthesized byproducts (e.g., enzymes and hormones). More implicitly, it invites an inquiry into environmental factors ("pressures"), including cultural ones, that interact with aspects of genotype; this is one major reason why a refinement of the maximization principle is bound to be a principal project of evolutionary behavioral science-we need a more focused program of research on the factors that facilitate or, conversely, mitigate the tendency toward fitness maximization. It is also possible to specify some bases upon which the maximization principle is grounded. Without presuming to tell the full story, we can underscore three sources of inference and/or derivation for it. First, it is inferred from the fundamental biochemical property of the cell, self-replication; it is ultimately on this basis that R. Dawkins (1976), for instance, could argue that organisms are "survival machines" for DNA (genes). Second, it could be shown on the basis of the sentential calculus that it can be derived from Darwin's argument on the struggle for existence, when W.D. Hamilton's (1964) work on inclusive fitness is accounted for. Third, it can be</page><page sequence="9">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 411 inferred from the numberless observations across the multiplicity of animal taxa that organisms direct a large portion of their behavior toward enhancing their probabilities of direct or indirect reproductive success; such observations comprise nearly all known primates, ourselves included (see, e.g., Ortner 1983; Betzig et al. 1988; and the slew of research reports in our primatology journals). Are genes, whether singly or, much more likely, in compound form ("polygenes"), causally linked to some types of human social behavior? We do not know for sure. But, given the fact that science has reached the stage where an answer to the query is almost certainly forthcoming in the near future (witness the recent publication of the first map of the human genome), we can neither deny it nor avow it categorically until the evidence is in. In the meantime, it would seem reasonable to become keenly aware that: (1) extreme environmentalism may be a factor in the persisting sociological crisis; (2) extreme anthropocentrism is unbecoming to the universalizing mind that would sanction our universities and, recall, is also a corollary of the geocentrism that, until rejected in the 16th century, interfered with the development of physical science; (3) certain facts do suggest a preliminary affirmative answer to the question posed above. They include, inter alia: (1) the admittedly controversial literature on "cultural universals," which invite (but do not demonstrate) a homology hypothesis (e.g., Murdock 1967; Lopreato 1984; Brown 1991); (2) studies of children adopted at birth, which show on various measures far greater similarity between child and nonsocializing, biological mother than between child and socializing, adoptive mother (e.g., Horn et al. 1979); (3) studies of identical twins separated at birth showing, on various measures, similarities between the two that are almost identical to the similarities observed between identical twins reared together, and far greater similarities between the identical twins reared apart than between fraternal twins reared together (e.g., Loehlin and Nichols 1976; Mednick et al. 1987; Bouchard et al. 1990). Insofar as Homo sapiens is concerned, sociobiology appears to have inspired several lines of scholarly inquiry. Two are particularly important. One is a quest for the analogue of the gene that would constitute the basis of a theory of biocultural evolution. Several analogues have been proposed, for example, "memes" (Dawkins 1976) and "culturgens" (Lumsden and Wilson 1981). Little progress has been made in this area. We personally have little faith that such an entity exists. Moreover, we have little or no conception of what "evolution" would come to mean in social science. For instance, would it mean that we could specify, however roughly, the time-point at which enough "mutations" had taken place in a given social system whereby we could say that the analogue of speciation had taken place? How would we define such a system? And how would such an analogue be conceptualized? For us, then, as for Professor Crippen, if we understand him correctly, an opening to evolutionary biology appears to be promising in two basic respects: (1) to hypothesize on the evolutionary origins of certain human patterns, for example, ethnocentrism, "sexism," social inequality, varying reproductive strategies, and so forth-and thence to proceed to theoretically organize classes of behavior; and (2) to hypothesize about the variable persistence of such patterns and about the</page><page sequence="10">412 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3, 1994 variability of the associated features just now implied by the reference to classes of behavior. A second line of inquiry concerns the quest for a theory of human nature. Such a theory, on which work appears to have been more promising, is directed toward singling out the innate tendencies ("behavioral predispositions," "epigenetic rules," "adaptations") that have evolved during our phylogenetic and cultural history and, in keeping with the logic of the maximization principle, impel with varying intensity toward activities that to varying degrees are adaptive or fitness-enhancing. The theory of human nature is, in turn, divisible into two major branches. One aims at species-wide uniformities (e.g., Wilson 1978b; Lumsden and Wilson 1981; Lopreato 1984; van der Dennen and Falger 1990). The other, considerably more active in recent years, focuses on "individual differences," especially across genders. The volumes by Ortner (1983) and by Betzig and associates (1988) are good examples of this type of research (but see also, e.g., Betzig 1986; Bell and Bell 1989; van der Dennen 1992). Research has been enhanced by the application of various other tools of evolutionary science. Sexual selection (Darwin 1871) is a basic one; it directs attention especially to various aspects of male competition. Two others, equally important, concern "kin selection" and "inclusive fitness"; these have come out of the study of haplodiploidy (Hamilton, especially 1964,1972), although they were implied by Darwin himself ([185911958), precisely in view of eusocial (haplodiploid) species. This type of reproductive system, which comprises a peculiar arithmetic of Mendel's coefficient of relatedness (r), has revealed that one need not be reproductive to achieve genetic fitness-to obey the mandate of the "selfish gene" (a metaphor!). One can achieve the same "end" by helping (being "altruistic" toward) one's genetic kin. Hamilton's discovery has gone far toward suggesting plausible ultimate (bottom-line) explanations of a variety of human phenomena, for example, phenotypic preferences in relationships, the tendency toward homogamy, the tendency toward incest avoidance, and even the pattern of last wills and testaments. The theory of kin selection, as Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness has been called, has been complemented by the theory of "reciprocal altruism" (Trivers 1971,1985), which helps to explain mutually beneficial exchanges between unrelated individuals, and is therefore especially useful for observations in the complex modem society. Professor Maryanski's article offers a good pr&amp;cis of Trivers's theory. Kin selection, inclusive fitness, and sexual selection show great promiuse for providing reasonable hypotheses about individual differences (see, e.g., Dawkins 1976:chs. 8-9; van der Dennen 1992). In this, they are assisted by specifiable physiological mechanisms, preeminent among which is anisogamy. This term refers to the difference in the structure of sex cells between the two genders throughout the sexual biotic world. The inequality of structure implies inequality in numbers as well. Male cells are small, numerous, and lacking in nutritious value. Female cells are larger, much scarcer, and nutritious. Many behavioral differences between men and women appear to be partly rooted in this difference. One of</page><page sequence="11">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 413 us has recently presumed to state a Law of Anisogamy as follows: "The two sexes are endowed with differing reproductive strategies, and their behaviors reflect that difference in direct proportion to their relevance to it" (Lopreato 1992). Twenty years earlier, R. Trivers (1972) had published a paper on "parental investment" that has become enormously influential among evolutionary social scientists as well as zoologists. The considerable literature that has surrounded it, or to some degree has been informed by it, is mounting daily and provides cogently structured answers to a host of sociological problems, including various aspects of sex roles (e.g., Symons 1979; Betzig et al. 1988; van der Dennen 1992), rape (e.g., Thomhill and Thomhill 1983; Thiessen 1986), child abuse (Daly and Wilson 1985), homicide (Daly and Wilson 1988), and numberless others. Both differential parental investment and sexual selection may be conceptualized as corollaries of the law of anisogamy (Lopreato 1992). Professor Crippen is one of the best-informed social scientists on all such issues. His basic aim in the article appearing in this issue is twofold: (1) to suggest the value of nomothetic reasoning by reference to the maximization principle and several specimens of published sociological research; and (2) to demonstrate the possibly enhanced value of the maximization principle when applied in the modified, contingent fashion suggested several years ago by one of us (Lopreato 1989). In the process, Crippen's objective is also to underscore the relevance of sociological factors to the principle and, thus, the likely contribution sociology can make to the emerging evolutionary science of human behavior. Nothing, as we read it, is cast in stone. The intent is to engage his peers in a dialogue. As such, it may deserve total rejection, or it may not. It does not, by the most basic rules of scholarly discourse, warrant reactions that are typical of quarrelsome and ill-informed minds. ON THE REACTIONS TO CRIPPEN'S ARTICLE Maryanski and Evolutionary Sociology We turn first to Professor Maryanski's article and to an important passage in it. "One of sociobiology's great virtues," she writes, "is its clear methodological protocol which addresses broad and basic questions in terms of one set of coherent concepts. As a result, investigators follow a systematic research procedure which, in turn, allows scholars from diverse fields to converge upon a common set of issues" (our emphasis). We cannot think of a more lucid way of underscoring, however indirectly, the existing sociological disarray and of pointing the way, by implication, to the beginning of a possible remedy. At the same time, the writer elegantly captures the spirit of what we think is a scientific revolution of enormous proportion and almost quotidian resonance: The behavioral sciences are converging on a scientific paradigm whose basic elements have been put forth by evolutionary biology. The contributions of social science are not, however, inconsequential. We rather suspect that, as the revolution unfolds, both the biological and the social disciplines will be radically transformed. Woe, however, to those who would stem the revolution</page><page sequence="12">414 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3, 1994 instead of facilitating it. Herein lies the unrelenting danger for an insular sociology. We might add that if the set of sociobiological concepts is coherent, it is precisely because it is held together by "the overriding importance of fitness," as Maryanski herself implies by reference to Fisher's (1930) work in her excellent sketch of sociobiology's roots in the issues of modem biology. And fitness, of course, is the metric of the maximization principle. We also applaud Maryanski's invitation to an inter-primate comparative sociology. It is preposterous that sociologists should relinquish almost entirely the comparative study of some 200 species of primates to zoologists, anthropologists, and even astronomers (Sagan and Druyan 1992). We do not, however, agree that a comparative primate sociology, what the author terms "evolutionary sociology," would represent "an alternative to sociobiology." Sociobiology, an affiance of disciplines, already comprises the science of primatology which, like ethology, has been one of the major moving forces of the emerging sociobiological synthesis. The question would still remain as to what theoretical tools would help to organize the subject matter of this new evolutionary sociology. Concepts in themselves are not adequate for such a purpose. Without a general law to guide concept formation and research protocols, we might have a larger data base and a multitude of findings, but sociology might, ironically, be worse off than it is at the present. Facts we have to excess; it is the ability to make sense of them that is missing. We question whether a greater excess would improve our condition. And that leads us to several criticisms that we have of Maryanski's article. It seems to us that, like the other critic of Crippen's article, she accepts uncritically the old criticism of an "overly adaptationist" sociobiology, whose foremost author is R.C. Lewontin (e.g., 1979), an excellent zoologist who on human issues tends to mix science with ideology. At any rate, Maryanski would have sociobiology hold that "non-adaptive behaviors were selected out long ago, leaving in place morphological and social traits that now serve the functional goal of maximizing fitness." Careless statements there are in the literature. But the author gives no substantive evidence to support such an extraordinary assertion. Indeed, the draft of Maryanski's article reached us without the set of references, and we had no sure way of determining, on the basis of textual references alone, the possible substantive sources of such a misunderstanding as the above. By the same token, we must add, incidentally, it is not easy to determine the veracity of the assertion that "quite a number of sociologists has already incorporated the Modem Synthesis into sociology but without the sociobiological thesis." Indeed, to the extent that we recognize the cited authors, some are in fact "sociobiology-types" (e.g., Machalek 1986, who, among other things, has spent a productive year in E.O. Wilson's shop-see also, e.g., Crippen and Machalek 1989); some others give only lip service to aspects of evolutionary biology. At any rate, we must emphasize that to hold that "non-adaptive behaviors" no longer exist is to hold that "adaptiveness" is a quality rather than a quantity. It also amounts to saying that natural selection is no longer at work, which is to say, in turn, that sociobiologists have taken leave of their senses and jettisoned "the theory of evolution by natural selection."</page><page sequence="13">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 415 As one of us has pointed out (Lopreato 1984), sociobiologists at times do take liberties that render them vulnerable to accusations of "overadaptationism" by those who are inclined to criticize in the first place, and tend to stress careless statements rather than the output of sustained application. A case in point is provided by Crippen himself, who rather cryptically if not entirely erroneously states that "strategies that maximize an individual's 'Darwinian fitness' (i.e., personal reproductive success measured in terms of the number of surviving offspring) are favorably selected. Alternatively, behavioral strategies that diminish an individual's fitness are selected against." There is a bit of a mixture here of Darwinian and neo-Darwinian conceptions, but as far as Darwin ([1859] 1958) was concerned, natural selection did indeed refer to the "preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations." Nevertheless, neither Darwin nor Crippen, nor any other evolutionist we know, would be unaware that what is adaptive today may very well be quite maladaptive tomorrow, not to mention the continual emergence of maladaptive behavior, with the result that the natural selection "sieve" is ever at its winnowing work. Moreover, Crippen emphasizes the point that "social behaviors, along with all other genetically constrained traits, may be adaptively neutral or, in some cases [many cases], maladaptive." Further, Crippen recommends Lopreato's (1989) emendation of the maximization principle in part precisely because of the "logical awkwardness" of the unamended principle, which presumably (we do not agree entirely) "invites investigators to focus almost exclusively on the adaptive consequences of social behavior." The awkwardness is certainly there, often. David Barash (1982:42-43), for instance, states what he calls "the central principle of sociobiology" as follows: "When a behavior under study reflects some component of genotype, the animals should behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness." That "should" does imply an overadaptationist stance, although the term is used metaphorically. Indeed, nothing in Barash's text justifies a reader's emphasis on this linguistic gaucherie. Barash (1982:49-63) devotes an entire chapter to a denial of his own "should" and concludes with the following statement: "Individuals tend to behave in a way that maximizes their inclusive fitness" (Barash 1982:62, our emphasis). Likewise, E.O. Wilson (1975: 577-our emphasis), the putative father of sociobiology and favorite target of sociobiology's critics, defines "adaptation" as "any structure, physiological process, or behavioral pattern that makes an organism more fit to survive and reproduce in comparison with other members of the same species." It follows that: (1) some traits are more adaptive than others; (2) adaptiveness must be understood as a variable; and (3) it makes no sense to hold that non-adaptive behaviors have been selected out. "A second major impediment [to accepting sociobiology] is the validity of sociobiology's core assumption that organisms are always seeking to enhance the number of genes they leave behind." Indeed, there is no such "core assumption" in sociobiology. The error here is almost identical to the one noted just above. Incidentally, it is shared by Professor Freese, the other critic (1994, this issue), who states: "Provided alleles that encode for behavioral variants, the behavior of individuals is therefore supposed to maximize their fitness."</page><page sequence="14">416 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 As we have already pointed out, the maximization principle is a statement of variable tendency. It states no more than this: Organisms constituting a population are programmed with varying degrees of intensity ("hardness") to compete for scarce resources with one another. This competition results in varying degrees of fitness. Failure to understand this basic point implies failure to fully grasp the meaning of natural selection and is bound to vitiate a proper understanding of sociobiological reasoning. In this respect, neither "Crippen's selectionist approach," nor Lopreato's (1989) emendation of the maximization principle "is fundamentally different," as Professor Maryanski would have it, "from traditional sociobiology." What we have done is to an extent explicate what is deeply inherent in sociobiology and to suggest to our colleagues that their contribution to the further development of evolutionary behavioral science is thus of capital importance. There are a number of other points in Professor Maryanski's otherwise excellent article that, if time and space limitations permitted, would deserve careful attention. They include alleged problems of fitness metrics, of status as related to fitness, of reductionism, and, among others, of tautology. This latter allegation is especially tempting. It is inextricably tied to the aforementioned errors in the critics' understanding of the sociobiological, indeed the Darwinian, use of "fitness" and "adaptiveness." According to Maryanski, "sociobiology explanations can slip into tautologies: Why does a social behavior exist? It exists because it promotes fitness. How do we know that it promotes fitness? It promotes fitness because, otherwise, it would not exist." We are a little surprised that this old lemon concerning Darninian theory in general has now popped up again. We remind Professor Maryanski that, as she has herself noted in relation to RA Fisher's (1930) work on "the genetical theory of natural selection," fitness is of "overriding importance" in Darwinian theory in general. Now, the charge of tautology against Darwinian (fitness) theory is very old, but few perhaps did more than K. Popper (1959, 1972; see also, e.g., Waddington 1960) to broadcast it. However, we do Popper as well as Darwinian scholars a disservice if we continue to perpetrate an error that Popper (1978) himself has recanted. The error recognized by Popper concerns, as we suggested above, the failure to recognize that in Darwinian theory adaptiveness is a variable and that "all products of evolution are not ipso facto useful or adaptive." Accordingly, Popper (1978:345) reversed his argument regarding the alleged tautology and untestability of Darwinian theory as bluntly as follows: "I have changed my mind about the testability and the logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation." One question only remains on this complex and comprehensive issue: Is it possible that a distinguished zoologist like E.O. Wilson, widely acclaimed for his evolutionary work, does not understand the theory of natural selection! The Battle of B-B Guns Against Sociobiology On the whole, Professor Maryanski's article is both judicious and highly informative. The author also has the rare virtues of being modest in her lessons,</page><page sequence="15">Sociobiology and the Waywvard Crtic 417 open-minded in dialogue, and above all constructive in her criticisms. By contrast, Professor Freese's interminable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and amounts to a rambling tirade, often so nasty and presumptuous that it ends by being almost entirely shorn of any saving grace. It is hard to imagine what this critic intended to accomplish. At best, we gather that he took this occasion to provide a diverting parody of sociobiology for what might be a new, postmodernist, politically correct breed of human ecologists. To the extent that he stays close to material readily available in elementary texts, rarely however revealed to the reader, he can also convey, on occasion, a technical flavor of subject matter, although all too often along tortuous and irrelevant paths. "Modesty," says he, "is not sociobiology's strong suit." Yet, the subjects on which he claims "technical" expertise, and on which he would scornfully bestow belittling lessons, are truly innumerable. In the process, he treats us to an endless philippic against "simplistic," "sophomoric," "illogic," "kindergarten theories" stated in "infelicitous prose" to boot. His specialty is a mocking attitude whose targets include such scholars as Edward 0. Wilson, genome project scientists (at least indirectly), Darwin himself, who was "exercised" by what has come to be known as kin selection, and Richard Dawkins (who took his "breath away" with his [unrecognized] metaphor that "selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage"). His own extraordinary erudition, however, is richly embroidered with metaphors, more easily recognized and more unctuous, namely, musical, religious, and metaphysical metaphors: "songs," "melodies," "chords," "rhythms," "compositions," "orchestrations," "hallelujahs," "hosannas," "catechisms, " "creation myths," "sanctified genes," "the Grand Designer," "controllers," "chickens and eggs," "cardinal values," and "the essence of things," among many others. We trust that the master of such a learned tract knows the rules of the game inherent in the old apothegm: Cobbler, stick to your trade-judge not other trades by the deeds of a noisy hammer. A charitable count of his mistakes, some gross even by elementary standards, yields an average of five per typed page. In what follows, we shall address briefly a few of those that fall in the following three closely related categories: (1) a faulty grasp of evolutionary biology in general and sociobiology in particular; (2) an equally poor understanding of the elementary logic of scientific inquiry; and (3) a tendency toward faulty reading of materials that it is kinder to attribute to ideology-driven carelessness than to an obvious alternative. The three are intimately related; we shall not, therefore, devote separate sections to them, but treat them in the order that is most convenient for our own imperfect minds. Because Crippen's article is intended to illustrate the possible nomothetic payoff of a sociocultural approach to the maximization principle, we begin with the critic's reaction to this issue. "1 reject as unfounded," authoritatively announces our learned colleague in the very first sentence of his "Abstract," "the argument that sociobiology can provide a nomothetic foundation for the sociocultural sciences" (our emphasis). From here,</page><page sequence="16">418 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 he proceeds to behave like that famous character in one of S. Leacock's novels, who threw himself on his horse and galloped furiously in all directions. We read Crippen to be intent in showing that "theory refinement" in sociology "can be enhanced," and "some seemingly troublesome theoretical problems" can be clarified "by reference to general principles" from evolutionary behavioral science. His critic would have been well advised to begin by showing, for example, that Crippen's "clarifications" and "enhancements" were only imaginary. But that is not his style. His specialty consists of pure assertions, categorical rejections, reproaches of "evil" intentions, criticisms of fictitious positions and errors, heterogeneous and irrelevant preachments-and almost never bothering to first represent faithfully the targets, or the sources, of his sweeping scholarship. But he is eager to play prophetic cognoscente. If ambiguity be harnessed in his mode of rejecting, he categorically denies that X can do Y. For some subjects, such an assertion can be easily justified. I categorically deny, for instance, that the sun revolves around the earth. But "X cannot do Y" on subjects that pertain to the unfolding history of present-day ideas! Get real! Even a grammarian might have revealed to our esteemed colleague that the juxtaposition of the term "unfounded," which implies foundational knowledge of both areas of scholarship (sociobiology and social science), with the term "can," which inevitably calls forth their potential for the time to come, is not the most felicitous combination for a scholar to make. Who can know what social science and sociobiology will be like, singly or in mutual cooperation, say, 50 years from now? Crippen's critic, like many another knocker of sociobiological arguments, is much influenced by certain well-known critics of sociobiology (e.g., Gould [1976] 1978, 1981; Lewontin 1979; Kitcher 1985) who happen to say much of what he wants to hear in the first place. There are, of course, other critics and countercritics, some of whom have no "egalitarian" axe to grind and who furthermore are specialized in the philosophy of biological theory (e.g., Ruse 1979,1988; Wilson 1986; Thompson 1989; Degler 1991:283; Holcomb 1993). But better than these, consider the following statement from R.C. Lewontin (1979:10, emphasis added): It is simply not possible to state whether there is any genetic influence at all on an individual's degree of xenophobia, dominance, entrepreneurship, conformity, indoctrinability, fear of incest, homo- or heterosexuality or any of the myriad psychosocial traits with which human sociobiology deals. But how does Mr. Lewontin know? As for us, and for most sociobiologists we know, we simply do not know (but see, e.g., Weinrich 1987). Accordingly, sociobiologists at best open-mindedly hypothesize on the possibility of such links. We underscore the questioning inherent in such hypothesizing. Thus, E.O. Wilson (1978b:143, emphasis added) states that "homosexuals may be the genetic carriers of some of mankind's rare altruistic impulses." "May be" does not equal "are." But for Lewontin, apparently, there is no difference between the two. We wonder whether he has by now heard of the research, focused on a possible genetic link to</page><page sequence="17">Sociobiology and the Waywvard Critic 419 homosexuality, in various genetics labs, and suggest that he consult the July 16, 1993 issue of Science for a tentative (and at best only partial) answer to his simple impossibility. The problem with categorical naysayers is that, since it is especially hard to own to one's embarrassing errors, they are condemned, like Thessalian Ixion, to countenance an unchanging vista for a failed seduction of those whom science, like implacable Zeus, necessarily denies to them. In all fairness, Crippen's critic does try to defend his assertion. And he compounds his error. Thus, at the start of a long-winded section that purports to discuss "the theoretical problems of sociobiology," he distinguishes between sociobiology as "a body of theory," "where promises cannot be kept," and sociobiology as "a field," "where promises are so far unfulfilled." You-Can't-Do-It now has found a brother in You-Haven't-Done-It. What an astonishing verdict! Unfortunately, it is very common in sociology. But would not tutored minds first have to specify "the promises" made and the time segment within which these were alleged to be fulfillable before announcing such a prescient and vigilant judgment? How and when are the promises of a science to be specified? What were the promises of physics and astronomy, say, in 1543, the year of De Revolutionibus? Or 99 years later, when Galileo died and Newton was born? Could Newton have predicted the Einsteinean theorem that if two bodies emit energy toward each other, they must also be moving toward each other? Could Darwin and Mendel have predicted that by 1993 the first map of the human genome would be available? Can anyone today foresee the full promises, such as they be, of the various genome projects? One thing is certain. Throughout the centuries, numberless have been the self-righteous comrades of You-Can't-Do-It and You- Haven't-Done-It. Some of Freese's problems may be problems of language, despite his reproach of sociobiologists' infelicitous prose. Having approached the maximization principle in his inimitable way, he adds: "Almost all talk about this idea [is] in teleological terms, and Lopreato once called genetic fitness 'a quest [that] inheres in the behavioral core of natural selection."' "Quest" then becomes "purposive- ness." Now, since the principle is intended to apply to organisms other than humans far more than to us, and the learned critic would be the first to attribute "instinct" to the behavior of other animals, it is hard to imagine how he (or Lopreato, for that matter) could come by such utter nonsense. We have checked our dictionary. "Quest" refers to "pursuit," "search," "an act or instance of seeking," and need not, therefore, be viewed as a "purposive" term. Do not bees, for example, go on a quest for nectar? The problem here may be defined very much as a spoke in that Ixion wheel we referred to just above. Scientists in general often use metaphors for convenience sake. Thus, one might say: "Mothers should favor some children over others." Another might ask: "How does that photon know that there is a hole in the screen before the wall?" Still another might state that certain male fireflies "gather in the trees at night and flash on and off in unison in an attempt to attract the females that cruise overhead." And then again another might write: "The hardware serves</page><page sequence="18">420 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 the purpose of the software." All such statements are metaphors, convenientfor purposes of avoiding repetition of the nomothetic matter behind them-very much in keeping, as we shall see, with Freese's own position that we need not make explicit appeal to general principles ad nauseam. But never mind what a habitual faultfinder says in one place. That may be convenient there. In another place, there is no convenience but a leap unto Ixion's wheel. We are reminded of the sort of scholarship that is perpetrated against our sophomores who learn in "Methods" to be extra-careful about studies without proper controls. Suppose that then a lecturer refers to a finding by a researcher of most impeccable scholarship, the first question that would be raised by students is the old lemon: "Ah, but did he control for X and Y?," typically basic variables automatically accounted for. Thus, a plain lesson has turned into presumptuous banality. Would the reader now like to know how kin selection (or "kinship" for the esteemed critic) came to be important to sociobiology? Easy! After the critic proceeds through a maze of "adaptations," "sociocultural forms," "sociotypes," (his term, specialized for "phenotype"), and a hint at what has been termed "the central tenet of biocultural science" (Lopreato 1984:107), he announces: Sociotypes are adaptations that can be positively selected. The ones we see are the ones that were. Now we have a hint at why kinship is so important to this [whatever "this" might be]. Genetic survival is got through reproduction that yields offspring called kin [good clarification]. Kinship is the vital center connecting genotypes to sociotypes.... With kinship, genes can be played like chips wagered at a gambling table.... Bet on the shooter. That is too simple. If the metaphor must be accepted, let us remember that most "players" are shooters. The issue does not revolve on who throws the dice. It concerns who wins more often. Kin selection is important to sociobiologists (evolutionists in general) for a great variety of reasons (see, e.g., Kurland 1980), including, of course a great many family issues. But first and foremost, kin selection has helped to update Darwinian theory and give a clearer view of the organic agent, and hence the unit of heredity, in evolution. The implications are legion. For example, "altruism," that is, reproductively self-sacrificing behavior, could not be said to evolve by means of Darwinian differential reproductive success. Conversely, it is easily conceptualized from the perspective of kin selection. Anyhow, as this lesson on kin selection takes us through the "evil" of 'Wilson's program," we are led briefly into the Trivers (1971) theory of "reciprocal altruism," which is "a special version of the general theory [how nice!] of social exchange and rational choice." "Rationality, on this theory [Trivers's], is an emergent quality of adaptations that are positively selected-a functional property that naturally accrues from selection itself, not to agents themselves" (Freese 1994, this issue, n. 6, original emphasis). Not to agents? Then to whom? The author of this wonderful lesson does not say; he merely denies it "to the agents themselves." As for us, we give it to the tooth fairy, for that is where "rationality" and "emergent functional properties" go as far as the evolutionary theory of "reciprocal altruism" is concerned.</page><page sequence="19">Sociobiology and the Wayyward Critic 421 On the whole, Mr. Freese has little quarrel with general sociobiology, although his mixture of mockery, ambiguity, pedagogic presumptuousness, and predilection for the randomly drawn banal often makes it impossible to know what he is up to. The major target of his contempt is human sociobiology. Here, he is so provoked by visions of "evil" intentions, "illogic," "reductionist" fallacies, and "rhetorical excess" that the byproducts of his political correctness sometimes go wildly astray. Here is an example. Note 1 informs that the term sociobiology will be used "as shorthand for human sociobiology, except where specifically noted." We now enter a 17-page discourse on "the myth making problems of sociobiology," hence of human sociobiology, in which the critic decries the fact that "the theoretical problems of sociobiology" "are cast in anthropomorphic metaphors .... [which] take the form of economic benefit-cost analysis or quasi-rational, individualistic utilitarianism" (our emphasis). He then proceeds to explain why such a strategy is a problem: "So what," asks the magisterial critic, "if the metaphors are anthropomorphic and the models utilitarian? Combined, these can lead to myth making through rhetorical excess, in which scientific theory and fact are used as props for ideological and moral agendas, that's what." What follows cannot be of interest to any one but its author. We just marvel. Since the focus here is on human sociobiology and its "myth- making ... fervor to explain human behavior, culture, and society," we have some difficulty divining the reasons wherefore the warring critic objects to anthropomorphic conceptions? Given Freese's seeming interest in ringworms, would he wish us to have ringwormomorphic conceptions of ourselves? "If there is a human nature, there is a ringworm nature." It is almost as easy as that to dispose of "human nature," but not before attributing to human sociobiologists "an equating of these phenotypes [behavioral and social phenotypes] with human nature" and "a human nature that almost any moral discourse would call evil." Like many others of his errors, this erroneous equation is of the critic's own making. We do not understand his aversion to "human nature," a conception that in various ways is deep-rooted in philosophical and sociological thought. We do know that he confuses phenotype with genotype. In the process, he has trouble with "coevolutionary theory," in which for him "culture is part of biology," whatever that might mean. Some sociobiologists think of human nature in "epigenetic terms" (Lumsden and Wilson 1981) and thus appear to blur the line between genotype and phenotype. But there are none who think of it exclusively in terms of phenotypes. If anything, the very opposite is true. Indeed, there are endless erroneous attributions in this neighborhood. Sociobiology, for instance, "is trying to prove that sociocultural evolution is reducible to differential allelic survival. but that is an article of faith"-of bad faith, one might be tempted to add if one did not suspect something far more virginal. In fact, sociobiologists are inclined to think that they have little to say about sociocultural evolution (e.g., Lumsden and Wilson 1981). At any rate, would it not be proper to give some specific indication of who is foolish enough to hold such a position?</page><page sequence="20">422 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 But what is more troublesome is the allegation of an "evil" conception of "human nature." Scholars know that the history of scholarship is replete with accusations of "evil" deeds. Socrates died on the accusation of "evil." Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, and Darwin, to mention but a few of our incomparable Masters, were all accused of "evil" reasoning. Indeed, the idea that, for example, human beings may be innately predisposed to be self-servingly altruistic (Trivers 1971, 1985:ch. 15) pales in its "evil" connotations by comparison to Copemican and Darwinian rejections of conceptions in the Book of Genesis. Moreover, most of the work on human nature is nowadays being carried out by our colleagues in bioethics, whose province is none other than the "moral discourse." With such metaphysical baggage burdening the critic's postmodernist and politically correct mind, it is not surprising that he is perfectly capable of such fatuous chatter as the following (our emphasis): "Creation myths tell about origins. In sociobiology this honor goes to the gene, sanctified as first cause and controller. Thou shalt place no other entities before it. The gene, an abstraction in population genetics, in sociobiological theory takes the principal material form that determines the essence of things." Quo vadis, antistes artis dicendi? We promise, dear colleague, genes are not abstractions. You actually ingest them every day, including your own if, like the rest of us, you engage in the life-saving reflex of swallowing. Here is your "abstraction:" a sequence of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, wherein each A = C5H5N5, each T = C5H6N202, each C (cytosine) = C4H5N30, and each G = C5H5N50. Cobbler, cobbler! On some occasions, Dr. Freese does play at least in the neighborhood of the ball park. Thus, suddenly picking natural selection out of this mythical bag, he states that "there are no selection forces." "There are selection effects." That is a rather gauche way of making a reasonable point, for on the face of it one might argue that if there are selection effects, there are also selection forces. But no matter. What is weird is that, while he would honor one of us by including him among the better known human sociobiologists, he adds to the above statement the following: "The creation myth of sociobiology turns on understanding evolution as caused by selection, with causality operating in a rather tight circle at that." Now, leaving aside the awful muddle that ensues from this latter statement, it is a fact that, as noted earlier, the argument against taking natural selection as cause was made by Lopreato (1989) in a paper that was of some import to Crippen's argument, and is included in the critic's "References." And so we come more directly to questions of the philosophy of science. It turns out that Timothy Crippen has entirely retrograde notions on the subject, for, according to his critic, "philosophers of science are not so taken with the covering law model of explanation as they once were. That model ... made it possible to claim a privileged status for any covering laws that could be shown to have the widest scope of application." This is fantastic language. We were not aware that political correctness applied even to the relative status of scientific laws. If such laws have the widest scope of application, why should philosophers of science now wish to democratize them? The clue, which refers not to philosophers of</page><page sequence="21">Sociobiology and the Wayward Critic 423 science but to postmodernist, politically correct thinking, lies in that "privileged status." One of these days, our sun will be accused of forcing the earth to be a satellite. What an awful lot has befallen postmodernists and politically correct scholars. Privileged statuses everywhere, even in the heavens! Horrors! We regret that we were not privy to the fact that modern philosophers of science "are not so taken" with privileged laws and wish only that a reference or two by the learned critic had allowed us to rid ourselves of our unfortunate lacuna. Intimately related to problems of the philosophy of science is, of course, the human sociobiologist's eagerness to make a distinction, mostly for the benefit of other social scientists, between ultimate, or distal, causation and proximate causation. Crippen's critic, like not a few other social scientists, is unhappy with this distinction, which accordingly tends to be viewed as a sort of fetish invented of late by those pestiferous sociobiologists or by H. Spencer at the earliest. The issue, however, is old. Cicero, for instance, found it necessary to distinguish between mira explicatio and abesse ab mira explicatione. In less remote times, leaving aside such expressions as "levels of causal orders" in physics introductory texts, where students are taught once and for all the crucial distinction, even novelists are unable to reason without such locutions as "the particular case" and "the final analysis." The critic's aversion to the language in question leads him somehow to problems of "invalid inferences" and, as he is ever in a position to give lessons on logic, inconsulte, to the problem of "substitution instances." "Invalid inferences," says he, "relating ultimate to proximate causation often ensue because of a misrepresen- tation that derives-I can only presume-from an ignorance of formal logic." Part of the two paragraphs that follow this jewel of modesty sounds very authoritative, though anyone who has had any training in symbolic logic easily recognizes it as matter readily reaped in any elementary text on the subject. It is also so much window dressing around another fundamental mistake. Somehow, the good critic has convinced himself that the relationship between ultimate causes and proximate causes concerns the question of "substitution instances." Thus, for him, "it is invalid to infer," as sociobiologists presumably do, "that ultimate causes are universals and proximate causes are particular instances of them." The distinction in question has nothing to do with "substitution instances," at least as used in Darwinian theory. Let us consider an example from evolutionary ecology of the relationship between distal causation and proximate causation. Of the 42 species of birds of paradise, nine are sexually monomorphic and monogamous and 33 are dimorphic and polygynous. Allegedly, polygyny represents a fairly recent development in some if not all of the concerned species. Why, then, this "shift" to polygyny? The explanation, according to some scholars (Beehler and Pruett-Jones 1983; see also Beehler 1989), refers to the interplay between anisogamy, the ultimate cause, and the manner in which an ecological set of factors (e.g., diet) acts on polygyny. More explicitly, given anisogamy (distal cause), males may be expected to incline toward a polygynous reproductive strategy, and they are alleged to pursue it if the females have the adequate anatomy</page><page sequence="22">424 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 (e.g., beaks) to fetch insects out of tree bark and/or have access to highly nutritious fruiit (e.g., nutmegs) (set of proximate factors) so that they can raise the young without the fathers' participation. Now, let the logician-critic call specialized beaks and diets "instances" of anisogamy and make a logical hole in the water. He would be much closer to substitution instances if he considered, say, kin selection and types of sexual selection as instances of natural selection. Likewise, with some slight license, behavioral predispositions may be viewed as substitution instances of the maximization principle. Let us reiterate a basic point. The basic sets of causes in evolutionary biology are "organism" (genes) and environment: the one "ultimate," the other "proximate." They are separate and distinct but complementary; neither can be a substitution instance of the other. Proximates, can for the sake of abbreviation, be used in the absence of, though not as substitutes for, ultimates. But this strategy concerns convenience; it has nothing to do with formal logic. We shall conclude with two more examples of misdirected criticism in this already overly long preoccupation with Crippen's critic's article. First, in note 10, the critic appears troubled because "Crippen exalts [our emphasis-and Lopreato apologizes for the "privilege," but what manner of language is this!] Lopreato's (1989) conditionalizing of the maximization principle, the purpose of which is to account for the fact that there may be countervailing cultural conditions that prohibit the full realization of the principle. But," the polymath continues, 'look again. The third condition suggested by Lopreato is that inclusive fitness maximization is conditioned by the autonomization of phenotype from genotype [his emphasis]. In other words," he proceeds with what must seem to him a lethal thrust, "organisms are predisposed to behave so as to maxiniize their inclusive fitness, except when they cannot!" (our emphasis.) Analogous positions are ever recurring, especially among philosophizing social scientists-most recently, for example, in a debate concerning "ceteris paribus laws" in psychology (e.g., Fodor 1991; Schiffer 1991). Typically they reveal only a gross misunderstanding of the nature of scientific inquiry. Lopreato's (1989:129) modified statement of the maximization principle, reported also by Crippen, states: "Organisms are predisposed to behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness, but this predisposition is conditioned by the quest for creature comforts, by self-deception, and by autonomization of phenotype from genotype." We have underscored the term "conditioned" because, in addition to the fact that Lopreato was only too aware that his conditions might be inadequate in number and/or substance, he also avoided deliberately the more formal strategy, known to him at least since 1970 (Lopreato and Alston 1970), that would have required such a locution as "provided that" instead of "conditioned." There is, in short, some reason to think that the three specified conditions may modify the hypothesized predisposition. But at the present level of knowledge, there is no way of saying how and how much. We must underscore how much. To say that X conditions Y, as the moon, for example, conditions the earth's ellipse, is not necessarily to say that XD-Y. It is to say that X acts in some in-principle specifiable way and degree on Y. It is hard for us to imagine what sort of scholarship may have induced Crippen's reproachful critic toward that extraordinary "except when they cannot."</page><page sequence="23">Sociobiology and the Waywz7ard Citic 425 We may have pointed here to the error of mistaking a quantity ("to condition") for a quality ("except when"). Another error is far more grievous. One of Galileo's laws states that falling bodies accelerate at uniform speed, provided that they be freely falling. Now, at least in the vicinity of the earth, there is no such thing as a vacuum, although it can be easily simulated, say, at 10-6 of atmospheric pressure in our science labs. Would the esteemed derogator wish to say to Galileo (of late happily "in-communicated" by the Church and praised for having asserted a "privileged status") that falling bodies accelerate at uniform speed except when they cannot? The theoretical function of provisos (conditions, "ties," contingencies, etc.) in laws is to direct attention to the possibility of auxiliary propositions. What, for instance, are the factors that interfere with a vacuum, and how do they modify the behavior of various falling bodies? Or, what are the factors that account for degrees of autonomization (bodies do fall more or less freely), and how do they modify the hypothesized quest for inclusive fitness? Lopreato's critic seems intent in suggesting to him a strategy that has been only too familiar to him at least since he and Letitia Alston (1970) published, a quarter century ago, a paper on "Ideal Types and the Theoretical Idealization Strategy," probably a first and unique such work in sociology. We must reiterate the point that an idealization strategy was deliberately avoided by Lopreato (1989) because it is not warranted by present knowledge. Moreover, Freese's gratuitous, and faulty, lesson was attempted despite the fact that Crippen's article directs his attention to the Lopreato-Alston (1970) paper on idealizations. Lopreato thanks the learned critic for quoting him and wishes that the critic had quoted his sources a little more elsewhere as well. The critic has an odd conception of the function of quoting-a conception that typically goes with a strong tendency to speak off the top of one's head and also to distort the work of others. He is now about to "quote to save the trouble of paraphrasing." But why not quote in order to allow the reader to decide whether a critic reports or distorts? The quoting of strategic passages has the additional function of showing that critics have read the material they purport to discuss. Anyhow, in the inimitable language of our critic's "untasty metaphors" and "worms in the soup," it would seem that he wishes to demonstrate "superfluous inference" on the basis of five passages quoted from Lopreato (1984:120, 129, 138, 140, 141). There is, in fact, no evidence of such a demonstration. But it does turn out that: "In the contexts in which these quotes appear Lopreato is trying to connect proximate to ultimate causation." That is news to Lopreato. The first quoted passage, as the reader will note, is explicitly intended as a definition of "territoriality" (Lopreato 1984: 120). It should be obvious that any conceptualization of the tendency "to acquire and defend" a territory without reference to the valuables present therein would be vacuous at best. But not, it would seem, to our good critic. The second quotation from Lopreato (1984: 129) is equally irrelevant for the critic's alleged purposes, and represents a classical example of quoting out of context. Its function in the original text cannot be assessed apart from the two</page><page sequence="24">426 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 37, Number 3,1994 sentences that follow it. The three together are intended to make a distinction between those types of harm that we sometimes do to others when we behave "territorially" and those that we perpetrate under "the urge to victimize." The latter are typically more grievous. Of the remaining three quoted passages, the third and fourth (Lopreato 1984: 138,140) offer evidence against which the reader may judge whether the hypothesis of "the urge to victimize" has any plausibility and utility. We have always been taught to test our hypotheses against whatever facts are at our disposal. Accordingly, the hypothesis in question was discussed by reference to facts from several sorts of "exploitation," for example, legal abuses against the weak, slavery, genocide, even human sacrifice. The final quoted passage is a partial summary of the section on victimization. The critic wishes to show also that the "proximate causes" underlined by him in the quoted passages "are all ecological." That is stretching the point a bit, but we are delighted that he did catch this point, for the drama of evolution is indeed played, as every evolutionist is keenly aware, on the ecological stage. But the critic's ability to misread and misinterpret is truly prodigious. The partial summary alluded to above (Lopreato 1984:141) states that behaviors reflecting "the urge to victimize" (e.g., slavery) are susceptible to cultural explanation, but ultimately are predictable from natural selection, which sensitizes to the ugly facts of competition. Now this statement becomes something else in the critic's article, which states: "the manner in which that competition will be resolved most certainly is not predictable from the theory of natural selection...." Bravo, Dr. Freese! We agree. But, you see, the quoted statement says nothing about "the manner in which that competition will be resolved." It merely states that facts of exploitation, and hence differential life chances, are inherent in the process of natural selection and in that sense are predictable from it. We do congratulate the esteemed critic on one point, namely, the allegation that no biologist known to him denies "some general connection" between fitness and energy utilization (the ecological focus), though we do not fully understand the meaning of "general connection." At any rate, Professor Crippen, and we, typically address not biologists but sociologists. We further agree that general principles need not be appealed to ad nauseam. "The invoking of genetic maximization," for instance, "is no more than an injunction by which to organize oberservation protocols." Well said, "no-more-than" hyperbole notwithstanding (see, e.g., Lopreato and Alston 1970; Lopreato 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993). But that is exactly the point of Crippen's article. Sociology has a multiplicity of observation protocols that persist in remaining unorganized. Try using the confounded principle to see whether their organization is possible to one degree or another. If it is not possible, reject it. If it is possible, retain it, improve it, and add other statements of theory that will help to avoid repeated appeals to it. In conclusion, we hope that Professor Freese will rethink, in a more open-minded posture, some of the issues touched upon in the foregoing paragraphs and others that we have had to leave out. The latter include the implications that "thought</page><page sequence="25">Sociobiology and the Wayward Citic 427 experiments" are only imaginary; the assertion that "theory reductions are rarely undertaken"; and, among others, the transformation of "selection advantage" into a cascade of allegedly impossible "interests" (e.g., how can memes have "interests"? Metaphor, again!). More than anything else, however, we wonder, in retrospect, whether Professor Maryanski's call for an inter-primate comparative sociology might not in itself be the beginning of a solution of some of our difficulties, despite the problems that, as we have tried to note, are associated with her proposal. The basic difficulty sociologists experience with evolutionary reasoning issues forth from their anthropocentrism, which entails a holy distaste for "the animal connection." Maryanski's proposal, should it be put into effect, might result in a weakening of that aversion. It is possible that, this basic problem once resolved, the solution of others would then ensue-and the work of the likes of Professor Crippen would make more sense. REFERENCES Barash, D.P. 1982.
