<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS: A CONTRIBUTION TO MARX'S IDEA OF THE SOCIAL ROLE BY EDUARD URBANEK Vjzechoslovakia, since the year 1956, has passed through many phases in the sphere of art, culture and social science during which questions, ideas and problems which had been ignored, vetoed, prohibited or repressed because of the restrictive atmosphere of the so-called cult of personality period were rediscovered and discussed. These reassessments and "rehabilitations" have usually had the outward form of fads. Modernism and some conjunctur- ality were contemporary transient features of these processes, and simultaneously somewhat responsible for additional mistakes and errors. The outward popular form of the essential necessary re- turn to normality found its expressions first where the rehabil- itated problems and questions engendered an atmosphere of snobbism, with the facile use and abuse of terms and ideas as cheap labels for the designation of complicated and profound questions, which cannot be solved or comprehended without ex- tensive knowledge and serious thought. We may note for ex- ample the fad affecting Franz Kafka's rehabilitation, and how the absolutely necessary return to Marx's conception of alienation and to his early work in general has been inundated by vague and often dilettante publicity, where declension of the word "aliena- tion" was directly related to the depth of misunderstanding and vulgarization. The processes of return and normalization neces- sary to correcting perspectives give dilettantes an opportunity to put on airs, to develop a fashionable jargon from a complicated problem so as to demonstrate their own culture, modernity, etc. Often the result of such dilettante activity is a passing fad in the world of culture or social science, and the obscuring of the real</page><page sequence="2">530 SOCIAL RESEARCH problematics, by the formation of false superficial ideas about a great number of problems and questions. The superficiality of such fads is demonstrated by the speed with which they are abandoned and new problems become fashionable and vulgar- ized. We now see that this process is affecting sociology. The launching and return of sociology, social psychology and psychology of labor, psychology and theory of management have been connected with similar negative features and at the same time have been accompanied by uncritical adoption of the termi- nology elaborated in the sociology of capitalist countries. Through such publicity the general thought has been invaded by a num- ber of vague terms which are constantly repeated without under- standing and with no critical reserve. Sociology and social psychology are contributing many terms and problems which are the basis for a host of superficial articles, in which these ideas are transmuted into a modern slang lacking any deeper approach or meaning. This concerns the problem of social roles and masks, which was almost completely eliminated and ignored by Marxist sociology and philosophy in the days of the personality cult. With the condemning of sociology and social psychology the question of roles completely disappeared. It is well known that the theory of social roles and masks is being developed very intensively in sociology and social psychology in capitalist countries, but often in forms which require critical revision or even outright repudiation. It is urgent to emphasize, in this connection, that neglect of the problems of roles and masks is inconceivable in Marxist oriented social sciences, be- cause Marx has much to say about the conception and solution of these questions. In Marx's frame of reference, which was that of universal man and universal history, the problematics of roles, masks and social characters is an organic part of his work. Marx's concern with roles is profound, although we do not find in his work this and that in the current great effort at precise definition of roles and social characters, as is typical of current Western sociological thought.</page><page sequence="3">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 531 We rarely find in Marx a definition of any problem, in the modern scholarly sense. Sociology and social psychology in most capitalist countries are obsessed with offering formal problematic definitions which become * ground for those endless discussions which appear currently in the textbooks of sociology and social psychology. In these controversies, commitment to a formally logical definition of a problem or question (for instance the definition of culture, democracy, ideology, social group, etc.) often results in mere defense and in innumerable opposing defi- nitions. It is questionable what significance there can be, for instance, in the formal definition of culture and the discussion of it, when one can enumerate two hundred and fifty separate definitions in the special literature. Democracy is defined in the literature of sociology, political sociology and political science about four hundred times at least. While Marx avoids such controversy, in the margins of his conception of history and human life there exist also a conception and explication of cul- ture, as is the case with his conception of democracy, ideology, social theory, etc. In short, references to role, mask and social character appear in Marx's work in many places, and definitely more frequently than is generally thought. But with Marx there is no purpose in precise enumeration of definitions. The conception of the social mask, together with the idea of masks and social character, is an inseparable part of Marx's concept of materialist history, and they are especially combined with the problematics of alienation and reification. Indeed this is the other side of the problem of alienation and reification. A summary of the problematics of the alienation of social action and human facts is what Marx characterizes as the reification of persons and personification of things. L. Sochor is probably the only one in this country who had referred to this other aspect of the alienation and reification process.1 But the same author has a predecessor in J. J. Rubin, a prominent iL.

Rubin in the 'thirties and in the era of the growing cult of Stalin's personality was accused of all possible errors, and termed a "counter-revolutionary Rubin Hood.1' His book, which was published in the Soviet Union in four editions under the title Ocerki teorii stoimosti Marksa is the outstanding work of an economist who had none of the failings of the majority of later economists, who lost a deep theoretical sense. He comple- mented his own grasp of theory and his ability of philosophical analysis with excellent knowledge of Marx's text and of the spirit of his works. His considerations of the reification of persons and the personification of things belong, I am certain, with the best of Marxist literature.2 It is interesting that the prominent theoreticians of Western countries, e.g., R. Dahrendorf, who is well known in this country, and the West German Marxologist, I. Fetscher, have recognized in their studies that Marx was speaking of roles and masks. H. Le- fÂ£brve also refers to this, pointing out in his analogies of aliena- tion and reification Marx's conception of roles and masks.3 It has been said already that Marx's problematics of roles and masks is connected with his universal conception of man, with the conception of alienation and reification, briefly formulated in the reification of persons and the personification of things. This conception is developed, with relevant terminology, in the later works, first in Capital, in Theories of Surplus Value and also in the manuscript Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Okonomie. But the origins and sources of these problems exist already in the early works of Marx and are later developed and elaborated. But the aspect of alienation, of reification of persons and per- sonification of things, is not expressed in the sphere of economics 2 T. T. Rubin, Oterki teorii stoimosti Marksa, Moskva, 1929. 3R.

Marx offers an excellent analysis of role and mask prob- lematics in his admirable literary The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, in which the terms mask and role are frequently used. Comprehending in Marx's spirit the conception of alienation as that stage of human activity where the creations of man - things, social relations and institutions - are gaining indepen- dence, are complicating and standing against man, are beginning to overcome man, where he stands opposed to his own facts and creations as against a strange, exterior, independent force which he does not understand because of its obscureness and complexity, we must not forget that in this universal idea Marx at the same time offers his idea of man, the individual. His doctrine of aliena- tion, which appears as the reification of persons and the personi- fication of things and which culminates in the historical level of capitalism is consequently a certain conception of the human personality, of the human individual at a time when the majority of men do not appear as individualities, and are reduced to acci- dental, dehumanized, uniform individuals, to bearers of certain roles, impressed through the urgency of alienated and reified conditions. Men are not authentic individualities, but are forced to put on masks. Under the pressure of particular conditions their individual characters are suppressed to such a degree, that they mostly have a socially shared, impressed character, and there- fore one which is also alien and not their own. For this reason Marx's conception is also the conception of the individual, of personality, and as such includes the social psychological aspect. It is evidently a much deeper conception than that of the mediocre representatives of contemporary social psychology, who offer only partial conceptions of the personality partly because they do not know, or ignore, the reification of persons and the personification of things. It is said very persuasively and frequently in works directed against Marx, that he was excellent as a theoretician, who ex- amined man as a mass creature, as a member of large, social</page><page sequence="6">534 SOCIAL RESEARCH groups, classes, working masses, that he saw the individual as a part of collective units, but that he ignored the problems of the individual and his internal characteristics. These objections are mostly the result of misunderstanding Marx. Marx examined only the social ways of human individuals' ex- istence at a time when it was typical that the overwhelming ma- jority of people, living in an alienated world of reified human relations and personified things, could not endure as personalities, nor as independent, free, creating and completely developed in- dividuals. It is exactly Marx's merit that he hinted at the fact that during an era of false human history, in the era of economic formations and especially in the capitalist economic formation man lives and operates in the very society, development of which in its phenomena reminds one of elemental, fatal, natural processes, where men's creations, things, relations and institutions act against mankind not as human forces, but as natural, blind, destructive, obscure, uncontrollable powers, reducing the true human substance and human individuality to a mere unit, and the average individual to a non-authentic being. Reduction of man to an average, to a bearer of common social qualities, roles and masks, to an impersonal, outward, shared and forced character is not Marx's invention, but the product of the evolution of that period of history, which is similar to the natural historical process, is false human history. Thus man, although he is the unconscious author of his own life's drama, exists first of all as an actor of a role, where the conditions, relations, cir- cumstances and institutions, though created by himself, are pre- scribed to him almost fatally and irrevocably. It is precisely Marx's merit that he saw this social aspect of man's existence, that he sought to explicate the origins of the relations among which man is obliged to live, and that he looked all his life for the ways to change man from an average, casual and partial individual, from an actor, a bearer of forced and external roles, into a free creator of his own historical process, into the conscious author of his own historical drama who could express himself and allow a</page><page sequence="7">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 535 free play to his own personal, irreplaceable character. The ob- jections to Marx's conception are competent to such a degree only as Marx himself was able during his lifetime to elaborate and use his method of the concrete totality, first, in working out uni- versal social relations theory in its alienated and reified form, and secondly in those spheres where the method of concrete totality passes over into application to the individual approach. This is demonstrated brilliantly in his work on Louis Napoleon. There was also the influence of the majority of Marx's pupils and the interpreters of his works in the days of the Second Inter- national, as well as those of the Stalinist era, who in their interpretation of Marx overruled the reduction of the individual to the product of circumstances, the executor of historical, objec- tive "iron" laws. A specific historical process in the culminating phase of alienation and reification was comprehended as a com- mon type of mankind's evolution in any historical epoch. In Marx's conception of the alienated and reified situations in which man of capitalistic formation is living, his creations, social relations, institutions, and the things that he has done, overwhelm him and gain their own independence. The alienation process appears in a certain form, mostly as loss and impoverishment, as loss of civil character, where man is losing and being robbed of his own final powers, given by nature and developed in the histor- ical process. But if we want to use a specific comparison analogic- ally following the formulation of the law of the conservation of energy, we could stress that even in society the loss of what man had created during the process of alienation did not mean total and absolute loss. What most people of the alienated and reified world have lost, what they have been deprived of, is transported and conferred within the framework of the alienated society's process in a special way on other people. The explicit social products, relations, institutions, social works and powers are ex- propriated, or within the frame of given conditions usurpated and monopolized by those who are somehow able to appropriate the misappropriated things and institutions and to dispose of them.</page><page sequence="8">536 SOCIAL RESEARCH In the most theoretical deliberations about alienation the first aspect of the process, the loss, the forfeiture of products and institutions, was emphasized. The second aspect has been less stressed; here, the expropriated, reified products of human actions are passing through special historical processes to particular per- sons. These individuals are alloted the alienated social capacities because they are enabled to act as the representatives of other people's powers and faculties, as the bearers and executors of these functions and roles. This process, or, more precisely, the second aspect of the process of alienation, is expressed in Marx's conception by the very terms of the personification of things, and, we might add, the personification of relations, social products and institutions, as well. The process of alienation, passing into reification, as the material subjects acquire other supernatural functions, qualities and roles, by which they mediate power, force and significance to those who casually possess them (who could not achieve them by means of their own abilities and faculties), is an excellent, methodological subject ground for re- search. How do people, in this world of alienated relations, play certain roles, have a definite importance, influence and power, not their own? How do they conduct themselves in the masks which show them in another character than their own? It is understood that the conception of roles and masks does not imply the deliberate process of pretending, of perpetrating a fraud in order to dispose of certain things which have social importance. The appropriation of social power does not mean the fictitious appropriation of power. The masks that the executors of certain social functions and roles bear, obscure, it is true, their authentic faces, and mislead the world and the public. But this does not mean their roles and masks, their power, and functions, are ineffective and illusory only. The usurpated, appropriated, alienated power of others, and maybe also the legitimately achieved right to dispose of socially expropriated powers, is more important than the indi- vidual powers and abilities in the alienated world of reified re-</page><page sequence="9">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 537 lations, of those people who exercise them. The roles, the shared masks, and the pretended roles are more important than the authenticity of the bearer's role. The roles and masks are consequently not unreal in the sense of power and significance, although they are phenomenonic from the point of view of their sources and origin. Their resource and substance are elsewhere than in the hands of the individual masks' keeper, and the actor of a role is socially conditioned. If we consider only the phe- nomenonic aspect of things, the result of the alienation and reifica- tion process alone, it is evident that it is superficial to view the world as a stage, as a great farce or comedy, or even tragi-comedy, where the people are purely the actors and masks' bearers, and the real substance, the processes that facilitate this phenomenon and create its environment are invisible. To describe the alien- ated world as a performance only, and all the people as actors, without any analysis of how it happens that the world is a theater, a stage with historically determined actors, and what the reduction of man to a mask and role means, is insufficient. To lose from view the real reasons leading to such a world image, and the possibility of looking for a way out of the world of roles and masks is likewise insufficient. If there is in contemporary soci- ology a prevailing picture of the theater with people as actors, bearers and executors of roles, then it is urgent to question the grounds of these ideas and to employ all intellectual capacities to understand this question. Marx's conception of the alienation and reification and the emphasis on the personification of things, on the historically and socially conditional tenor of roles and character masks can be - as I see it - also today an important historical presumption of the critical analysis of the conception of social roles and masks, and also of the notions of today's world as a great performance. And at the same time it also could be a ground to elaborate the tempo- rary marxist critical conception of social roles and masks, which would prohibit the reduction of man to the executor of roles and bearer of masks, as well as contribute to the attempt to find</page><page sequence="10">538 SOCIAL RESEARCH the way out for the world, where the author's creative part will overrule the actor's interpretative part. For these reasons it is useful and suggestive today to be concerned in the history of this question in Marx, to follow his ways of approach, to elaborate successively the series of terms and categories, and to intensify the research of the total conception from the initial indications and perceptions up to the definite complete conception that his later works comprehend. a) The Birth of the Problems of Roles and Masks in Marx's Work It has been already said that it is very difficult to seek in Marx's works an expressive definition of the category of roles and masks. Neither the term role nor the term mask is decisive, because there is a matter of the definite, complete conception of man and world and their historical setting in Marx's work. Considering these preliminary notes and not losing view of the context of the conception of roles and masks within the fundamental theory of alienation and reification, and especially the connection with the theory of the personification of things, we can seek the beginnings of all these ideas in Marx's early work, from the year 1842. One of the foundations of all Marx's deliberations, from the very first, is the dissatisfaction with the condition of the con- temporary world, and with man's position within it, dissatisfac- tion with how he is treated and managed, with what he is, with what he could be and is not. This discontent is combined with attempts to understand man's position and to find a way out. It is not accidental that already the first publications of Marx, and particularly his essays in the Rheinische Zeitung, are moving within range of the dissatisfaction with the contemporary world's situa- tion and with man's position in it, with the recognition that this world is not the world of mankind's natural disposition. There is no place here to analyze Marx's ideas on human nature, or his later idea of human substance or its origin. But what is sure is .that the. category of- r. human .nature, and human sub&amp;tance is</page><page sequence="11">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 539 Marx's basis for judging the situation of man, and the basis of the conclusion of the unnatural character of man's existence, of the falseness and unreality of human beings in the sense of their non-authenticity. These ideas are complemented by Marx's ten- dencies to search for the reasons for this state of affairs. He soon discovers the special constitution of contemporary society, and already in the early publications he raises the question of the special unnatural and apparently incomprehensible parts which the things of the human world play and which the people play, too, as long as they are the proprietors of various things, or are able to dispose of them. Marx rather suggests than solves the problem, like that of some concrete object which acquires special qualities which by itself it does not and cannot have, where such special qualities in- fluence the people's relations, in the famous essay "The Debates on the Law of the Theft of Wood." He says directly that "das Holz besitzt die merkwiirdige Eigenschaft, sobald es gestohlen wird, seinem Besitzer Staatsqualitaten zu erwerben, die er friiher nicht besatz." 4 In this context it is the matter of the relation be- tween the proprietorship of things and the right to dispose of them on ground of the private monopoly of the material objects' ownership. But the way of putting the question is typical of Marx. It is the problem to ascertain how the appropriating of things could give to their proprietor disposition of other powers, and, eventually, as Marx says, other qualities. This method of thought is not unique. In further developing his idea, Marx says that the representation of a special private interest "hebt alle natiirlichen und geistigen Unterschiede auf, in dem sie an ihrer Stelle die unsittliche, unverstandige und gemiitlose Abstraktion einer bestimmten Materie erhebt." 5 It is clearly emphasized on the one hand that all natural and spiritual differences are ne- gated, and on the other hand there is here a very proper formula- tion of "the abstraction of a concrete object," These ideas are *K.

Engels, Werke 1, s. 147.</page><page sequence="12">540 SOCIAL RESEARCH indisputably the source of the considerations developed later in Capital. It has been frequently pointed out that in the conclu- sion of the article on the debates about the law of theft of wood Marx used for the first time the term fetish. He adopts the idea of fetishes and fetishism from the book of de Brosse Du culte des fetiches. This is not the question of a brilliant aphorism only; rather, the march of Marx's ideas on the special qualities of things (of wood or gold) is developed in the same way in his later work. "Die Wilden von Kuba hielten das Gold fur den Fetisch der Spanier. Sie feierten ihm ein Fest und sangen um ihn und warfen es dann ins Meer. Die Wilden von Kuba, wenn sie der Sitzung der rheinischen Landstande beigewohnt, wiirden sie nicht das Holz fiir den Fetisch der Rheinlander gehalten haben? Aber eine folgende Sitzung hatte sie belehrt, dass man mit dem Fetischismus der Tiere ist verbindet, und die Wilden yon Kuba hatten die Hasen ins Meer geworfen um die Menschen zu retten." 6 It is meaningless to see in Marx's perceptions of this time some systematic theory, or to look here for origins of his later conceptions. But the following works of Marx demon- strate that certain sporadic questions or problems formulated for the time being in the perceptions only were really embryos and beginnings of later conceptions, and also that they were developed, enriched and analyzed systematically from all points of view in his later works. But it is crucial to note some points in this connection, which touch Marx's ideas and views chronologically. One can say that up to a certain point one may safely assume as the main early work Marx's Economic-Philo- sophical Manuscripts which contain passages on alienation and on the reversible might of money. Here he allegedly for the first time touches the problem of how a definite historical product of men (money) influences the individual and how its proprietorship or the lack of proprietorship adds or subtracts â¢ Ibid., F. Engels, Werke 1, s. 147.</page><page sequence="13">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 541 various qualities. Or, taken the other way around, Marx has very expressively demonstrated, by referring to the artistic lit- erature, how alienated social power could grant different quali- ties to its recipients, how they could, with the personification of this power, i.e., with social things and social products, play the most various roles and provide themselves with different masks not corresponding to their personal individual values. The Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts of Marx are his most significant early publications from a certain point of view. But they are a continuation of Marx's foregoing evolution carrying it to a certain point. The subject of alienation is analyzed here at its economic level and genesis and not only at the level of religious, political or ideological alienation. The question of these types of alienation is already touched on in Marx's works dating from 1843 in the publications preceding the Economic- Philosophical Manuscripts. A notable, but unfinished work by Marx, The Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law, is one of his most important works. Its importance for the elaboration of the concept of alienation and with regard to the question of roles and masks is not duly appraised. It is probably because this work has been overshadowed by the Economic-Philosophi- cal Manuscripts in recent decades. Few Marxists have observed the specific aspects of alienation in precapitalistic formations and another reason consists in ignoring and underestimating the question of roles and masks in Marx's work in general and in his early works especially. This underestimation was perhaps aggravated by the fact that the terms, role and mask do not occur directly in Marx's writings of that date. However, it is in Marx's review of Hegel's law of philosophy that questions of the alienation of precapitalist society are ana- lyzed distinctly for the first time in a sufficiently systematic way, that is, in the chains of events beginning with feudal society. Marx also takes note of the consequences which arise out of the characterization of the individuals living in that form of society. In most publications of Marxist literature touching</page><page sequence="14">542 SOCIAL RESEARCH Marx's idea of alienation the categories of alienation refer com- monly to capitalism only. Almost nobody mentions the lower forms of alienation of precapitalistic formations. It is presumed tacitly in most cases that alienation probably arises in capitalism only. But the fact is that Marx set forth for the first time in his work the systematic commentary of problems of alienation within the context of the passages where he is noticing the spe- cialities of the feudal way of output and the existence of indi- viduals in that type of society. Capitalism means, up to a certain point, the expanding of origins and elements of alienation exist- ing in precapitalist societies, in a certain way also the surmount- ing of a definitely lower type of alienation because of the devel- opment first of all of the sphere of economic activity to its limit, and this became a fundamental source of alienation and materialization of all human relations in capitalism. It is pos- sible to express the difference otherwise, too: alienation exists in precapitalist societies, arising first from the insufficient control of nature, and from the fact that all these societies are up to a certain limit class societies only, and economic formations, where the natural, i.e., given element plays a larger part than the historical one, which means nature transformed by man and his economic action. Capitalism of the developed form alone corresponds to the term class society; the precapitalist societies are only approaching this term. Likewise it is possible to say that the alienated and reified society corresponding with the terms alienation and reification is capitalism, too, and that the former societies know certain lower forms and sorts of alienation only. In precapitalist societies nature prevails over man and man does not yet govern nature for the purpose of changing it into a utility object. He rules nature in capitalism. It is a matter of a high level of transforming and ruling of nature by man, within the framework of the necessities of material output. During feudalism alienated nature rules man, little and insuf- ficiently transformed by man, whereas in capitalist societies the</page><page sequence="15">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 543 natural subjects and things created by man govern people and are the basis of the relations of alienation and reification. Con- trolled nature - the soil - and the biological qualities of man, especially birth, are the grounds of a particular form of alienation in feudal society. The processes of persons' reification and things' personification, which acquire social functions and characters because they are things and subjects performed, the created ones (output means, for example, capital, iron, or paper money) are the grounds of the alienation in the sphere of capitalism. The reification has the character of the naturalization of social rela- tions in the period of feudalism, or, we could say, it is the matter of alienation appearing as the naturalization and biologiza- tion of social relations. Hence the great significance of the purely naturally and bio- logically engendered facts in feudal society, such as birth, origin, rest on the importance of the soil and its proprietorship; and the great significance of the biological categories in the public po- litical sphere, especially in the relations of the dynasties and feudal monarchies. Marx takes notice in detail of the problems of biologization and naturalization of social relations during feudalism in the criticism of Hegel's philosophy of law, and in this connection draws attention to the fact that the natural physical qualities of the earth, or biological qualities of mankind, influence the crea- tion of characteristic social types, that they accept them and at the same time even impress on them special character masks. He does not use the terms roles and masks, but the problem itself and its analysis is given in very developed form. Marx is using here the term of individual social quality, in speaking of the social ways of man's existence in their historical forms in the frame of feudal society, of the individualization of social posi- tion, and of certain social functions, also. The term anthropomor- phization, which applies to land proprietorship, appears here for the first time. Marx brings the idea of personification into his conception much later.</page><page sequence="16">544 SOCIAL RESEARCH Marx's critical statements of Hegel's philosophy of law are well known. His comments on the specialities of feudal society, on social relations from the point of their naturalization and biologization, are quoted very often. But the understanding of the connection between these problems and the later conceptions of alienation, reification and personification of things does not appear in the literature. Until the terms role and mask be- came used, no test was made to bring Marx's considerations within the context of these terms. It is a fact that for Marx the social ways of people's existence during feudalism, the indi- vidualization of the social functions, are just character masks which people of this society wear, or more precisely, which they obtain in a definite context. The bearer of a function, or, we could say, a role, such as that of the governor, successor to the throne, nobleman, or lord, has a character mask. A role with a definite character mask is also typical of a member of the clerical hierarchy, of the landowner, etc. In this society, even more than in capitalism, various social functions, roles and masks have the tenor of something prescribed, constituted in advance within the frame of the precise professional and quite legally arranged and organized hierarchy. All the roles are here, if we use the terms of contemporary social psychology and soci- ology, and there are none or practically no roles achieved or gained by activity. A certain difference can be seen in that the complexity of these relations of the naturalistic, reification and biologization are not so great, and the obscurity not so explicit, as in capitalism. But it holds first of all in the relation of economic actions: the sphere of the economy is developed on a small scale, it retains for a long time the character of natural service relations and protection, but therewith the naturalized and biologized public and social-political relations are more mystic and obscured. It is interesting that for the first time in his Capital, when compar- ing the economy of feudalism and capitalism, Marx uses the term, character mask, with which medieval people confront each other.</page><page sequence="17">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 545 Although the relations among people are more transparent dur- ing feudalism even these people bear masks. "No matter then what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people in this society, the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations between the products of labour." 7 Marx expressly states here that during feudalism the relations between people in the performance of their labor appear as their own personal relations. In contrast to that and above all to their relations in the social, public, civil and political spheres are the relations, appearing as natural, concerned with the facts of birth and origin, which at the same time are a product of the specific level of social evolution. These are the social func- tions of individuals, individualization, the socially conditioned anthropomorphization of natural things. Marx expresses his thoughts very precisely and his considerations are very extensive in this connection. We may note the following: ". . . the es- sential nature of a 'special personality* is not in his beard, his blood, his abstract physis, but in his social quality, and state offices are no more nor less than the being and mode of action of men's social qualities. It is, therefore, obvious that individ- uals, insofar as they are the bearers of the offices and powers of State, have to be seen in the light of their social and not their private qualities." 8 Marx stresses in this quotation that it is not the definite, physical, natural qualities of man which make him the bearer of state functions and powers, but in further explication he ob- serves how the reversed relations result, that man's social quality and function are connected inseparably in particular social rela- tions with some of his physical qualities, which operate as if they themselves grant the social qualities. It is Marx's intention to determine how and why "the social modes of existence appear as qualities inherent to the subject." "At the apex of the political 7 K.

The highest state offices accrue to the individual through birth just as the place, character, mode of life etc. of an animal is born with it. In its highest functions the State embodies an animal-like reality." 9 Marx blames Hegel for this conception and claims that he is degenerating from his spiritualism to the deepest materialism. But at the same time he does not think that Hegel has devised this surface covering of the feudal world. Marx points out that Hegel is factually defending this phenomenal world of animal- like natural reality with his conception. Marx is trying to per- ceive how it happens that the feudal world experiences this reversal of "things into a subject and man into a predicate." "Since birth confers on men only their individual being and postulates it primarily as a natural individuum, while state as- signments such as legislative power etc. are social products, fruits of society and not creations of the natural individuum, it is the immediate identity, the direct coincidence between the birth of the individual and the individuum as the individuation of a given social position, function, etc. that is a surprise, a miracle. In this system nature makes kings at first hand, she makes peers etc. as she makes eyes and noses. What is surprising is to see as the direct product of a physical order what is merely a product of a conscious order. I am a man by birth without the agreement of society; a peer or a king is such from birth only by general agreement. The agreement alone turns the birth of such a man into the birth of a king; so it is the agreement and not the birth that makes the king. If birth, in contrast to other assignations, confers a position on a man directly, this signifies that it is his body that makes him the bearer of a given social office. His body is his social right. In this system the physical estate of a man or the estate of the human body (which can be developed to signify: the estate of the natural element of the State in physical terms) â¢ Ibid., F. Engels, op. cit. 1, s. 300-311.</page><page sequence="19">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 547 appears in such a way that certain social estates - the highest - are those determined by the birth of predestinated bodies. The aris- tocracy's pride in their blood, their descent, in short the genealogy of the body, is therefore quite natural; of course, this zoological outlook has its appropriate science in heraldry. The secret of the aristocracy is zoology" 10 Marx further observes how in the relation of the landowner, lord on the one hand and man of the soil on the other, there ensues a reversal of the fundamental relation between man and the natural subject at the margins of the explicit social circum- stances, conditioned historically. ''Two circumstances should be stressed in connection with the hereditary majorat: "1) The lasting element is the hereditary property, the land- holding. That is the permanent feature of the relationship - its substance. The heir, the owner, is really only so by accident. Landowning assumes an anthropomorphic guise through the var- ious generations. It is as if landed property always inherited the first-born of the house as an attribute tied to the property. Every firstborn in the line of the landowner represents the hereditament, the property of the inalienable landholding, the predestined substance of its will and activity. The thing is the subject and the man is the predicate. Will becomes the property of property. "2) The political quality of the heir is the political quality of his inheritance, a political quality inherent in this property. Thus the political quality appears here equally as the property of the landed property, as a quality belonging to the purely physical earth (nature)." u Marx virtually in this part specifies and complements his per- ceptions about the naturalization and biologization of social rela- tionships during feudalism, especially the political ones. It is a matter of fact that a particular natural fact, like for instance the soil, or the biological qualities of definite individuals, as their io Ibid., F. Engels, op. cit. 1, s. 310-311. moid., t. Jtngeis, op. cit. i, s. an.</page><page sequence="20">548 SOCIAL RESEARCH bodies, or birth origins, predetermines their social and especially political qualities. The tenor is, that naturalization and biolog- ization of social relations and particularly political ones obliter- ate the obscure economic grounds, which on their own, compared with capitalism, are embryonic only and insufficiently developed economically, and therefore covered by natural and political veils and masks. The public, political, legal relations during feudalism develop somehow naturally even an economic signifi- cance and function. It is a matter of some other sort of fetishism than that established during capitalism. The study and analysis of the specialities of the feudal society's social relations were Marx's important stage on the way to elab- orating the conception of alienation, reification and personification of things, and thus to elaborating also the conception of contempo- rary roles and masks, to which a particular level of social evolu- tion gives an impress and grants the individuals of the given epoch. Marx seldom returns to the problems of masks and roles during feudalism, to the special qualities of the individuals in that society. Interest in special forms of alienation and human activity's reification in the time of capitalism prevails in his further works, and the effort to comprehend the appearance of the personification of things, the alienation of social powers and the people's creations by the particular individuals in that stage of evolution. This domination of interest in the capitalist form of alienation and reification appears in Marx's studies of the Jewish question, in The Economic-Philosophical Manu- scripts, The Holy Family and in The German Ideology. But it is very interesting that Engels, who also unfolds the problem of alienation at its various levels in his early works, did not ever touch seriously the problems of roles and character masks in his later works. The theory of the personification of things and later also of the social relations and institutions (for instance power) in con- nection with the conception of roles and character masks really completes the conception of alienation and reification: Marx's</page><page sequence="21">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 549 idea of alienation and reification emphasizes, above all, how the alienated creations, relations, things, arise on a definite level from the complex of the cooperation of social individuals, whereas the conception of things' and relations' personification stresses the influence of these alienated and reified connections on the individual. It is then a conception of the socially condi- tioned behavior of an individual, the conception of his social motivation, his social roles and qualities. The objections against Marx that he is not keeping the individual in view, are partly correct, in that in the frame of the alienated, reified world, where people are mainly and primarily the bearers of roles and character masks, there is no question of the real, and more precisely, the right, individual. Most relations which man lives in are not active demonstrations of a real individual life in the alienated and reified society. What they really are is mostly not established by their own individuality. Social forces, as the result of collective cooperation, are alienated or, on the contrary, appropriated by individuals in this society. Social power as a social product becomes private power of the private person. The society of finance, however, the world of monetary marketing relations, is in Marx's conception a universal con- fusion and disorder of everything, i.e., a reversed world, a con- fusion and mess of all natural and human qualities (author's emphasis). It is a world where "individual behaviour returns to its antithesis, to material behaviour." It is the supremacy of social over personal might, the rule of the reified relations over the individual, oppression of the individual by accidental char- acter. The process in which private persons appropriate alienated social powers, personify them and play a certain part with the appropriate character masks, is lawfully determined by a given social structure, although chance occupies a considerable place in it. It is possible to seize the alienated social capacities and dispose of them perhaps in the case of inheritance, absolutely without any action, or to catch the alienated forces of the political power with a certain activity, but this activity is not proportionate to the</page><page sequence="22">550 SOCIAL RESEARCH power, which, for example, the ordinary individual has at his disposal. It is not Marx's intention merely to describe the supremacy of reified existence over the personal one, the casual over the necessary one; he also wishes to understand why people must or can play certain parts and bear certain character masks, and also to elucidate how it is possible that a person with average or inadequate qualities can play a definite prominent part. Marx has analyzed this problem in his brilliant literary form in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon. For our purposes the significance of this work consists in the fact that it contains his principal theses on the personification of things and on alienated social relations. Marx is examining in particular the roles which a certain "grotesque personage" is able to play by putting on the hero's mask, irrespective of his own very funny and average personal qualities. This is the phenomenon defined by contem- porary political science as the personification of authority or personification of power. We find in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon and also in The Class Struggles in France 1848-50 that Marx uses very often the terms, roles, masks and parts. This is not the first time he uses them. He speaks for example of masking and ob- scuring in The German Ideology, but it is of course also a matter of a certain specific use in connection with the analysis of the utility theory of the French materialists.12 A well-known formu- lation of the epoch-making mission of the proletariat exists in The Holy Family, and the often-mentioned aphorism, that "the people are simultaneously the authors and actors of their own drama" exists in the Misery of Philosophy. It is interesting that Marx in the two publications mentioned, The Class Struggles in France, 1848-50 and The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon uses a terminology of expressions and comparisons that is loaded with similes drawn from the theater. He asks 12 Ibid., F. Engels, op. cit. 1, s. 394.</page><page sequence="23">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 551 directly and tries to explain in his work on Louis Napoleon Bonaparte "how the class struggle in France created the cir- cumstances and conditions which enabled the average and grotesque personality to act a hero's role." Marx also speaks constantly of the costumes and changes of clothing of protagonists in this particular historical epoch. The classes of French society are pressed to "leave the boxes, the pits and the galleries and to act personally on the revolutionary stage." The replacement of the attempts at people's and national workshops has incited "intrigues worthy of Spanish comedies and servants' arch-cheats"; the "deceptive masks" of all factions of the exploiting classes were broken and they had to leave "the shelters behind the wings." Some scenes are performed on the "front stage," like the "parade and state parts," others occurred in the "background of the stage." The French politician Marrast discharged his "academic part not without talent." The peasants presented themselves as "active heroes of the revolutionary drama and could not be repressed any more into the part of a passive inactive chorus as in a certain situation of the French revolution." With the accession of Barrot's government "the official stage changed itself immedi- ately, the wings, costumes, speech, actors, 'extras', 'walk-ons', prompter, the positions of the parties, the play's motives, con- tents of plots, the total situation." Louis Napoleon "acts the part, tries to do it, is a jongleur, catching a public's attention." In other connections Marx makes him a "dirty figure," a "marion- ette," an "adventurer," who "is hiding his own repulsive trivial features behind the iron, postmortem mask of Napoleon." An- other time he puts on the "modest part," only to throw it away in another situation. Marx is using quite consistently the terms and expressions of the theater to describe the general character- istics of the whole manner of Louis Napoleon's conduct in the years of revolution prior to the coup d'etat. If we did not know that this is a theoretical-historical study of the years 1848-51, we might get the impression that it is a very detailed review of a particularly prominent play of a definite epoch of French history.</page><page sequence="24">552 SOCIAL RESEARCH But let us listen to Marx himself: "An old crafty rouÂ£, he con- ceives the historical life of the nations and their performances of state as a comedy in the most vulgar sense, as a masquerade where the grand costumes, words and postures merely serve to mask the pettiest knavery, at a moment when the bourgeoisie itself played the most complete comedy, but in the most serious manner in the world, without infringing any of the pedantic conditions of French dramatic etiquette, and was itself half deceived, half convinced of the solemnity of its own performance of state, the adventurer who took the comedy as plain comedy was bound to win. Only when he has eliminated his solemn opponent, when he himself takes now his imperial role seriously and under the Napoleonic mask imagines he is a real Napoleon, does he become the victim of his own conception of the world, the serious buffoon who no longer takes world history for a com- edy, but his comedy, for world history." 18 In none of Marx's later works can we find so often the use of the terms roles and masks, such expressive characterization of a certain historical epoch and of the protagonists of this period described in the metaphors of the theater. Where does this conception of Marx come from? Is he following some predeces- sors? Is his conception of this particular period of history as a play, and of a certain historical personality as a grotesque per- sonage identical with his over-all conception of history, of world and of man? To look for precedents for this conception and sources upon which Marx might draw, we should go back to antiquity. The search for documents which conceive of history as a stage and man as an actor would provide material for whole books. From Plato and the stoics (who saw the world as a per- formance, where everybody is acting the role assigned by God) to the Roman authors, the authors of the middle ages (Salis- bury), the Renaissance and the modern period, we can follow the series of aphorisms, metaphors and analogies, which compare 13 K. Marx, F. Engels, Selected Works, v. I., pp. 295-296, Moscow 1955.</page><page sequence="25">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 553 the world to the theater, and man to an actor and player of roles. Shakespeare is quoted most often. Passages in a number of his works are cited as proof that he saw the world as a theater only and everybody in it as a simple actor (e.g., "All the world's stage" ... in As You Like It). But to take the statements of the characters of some of Shakespeare's plays literally as proof of his conception of the world is to misrepresent grossly his real con- ception of the world and of men in it. Shakespeare develops the conflicts and tragedies of his characters in such manner that it is clear that their conflicts and tragedies occur precisely because his heroes are not and do not want to be the players of roles only. His heroes revolt and protest against being reduced to a common type of person, acting according to convention. All the great tragic figures of all great artistic works and of history itself demonstrate that it is neither universal nor fatally necessary to reduce man to an actor of prescribed roles. It is known that Marx highly esteemed Shakespeare: he knew large parts of his works by heart and taught his daughters to read and appreciate his works. He himself made use of references to Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies in his own work. It was Shakespeare who served him for the illustration of the all- transforming might of money thesis in the Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts. However it was not he, but, as in most cases in which we look for the continuity of Marx's thoughts with that of his predeces- sors, it was the representatives of German classical philosophy who probably inspired Marx in his conception of the world as a theater. This idea was widespread in German classical phi- losophy, as K. Kosik has emphasized recently.14 Hegel has un- doubtedly influenced Marx most directly in this regard. To be sure, Marx referred in his work The Eighteenth Brumaire I* K. Kosik, Individuum a dejiny. Plamen 10/66. pp. 3-10 (Individual and History).</page><page sequence="26">554 SOCIAL RESEARCH to Hegel, commenting that all epoch-making events and persons occur, so to speak, twice. And to this Marx adds, one time as a tragedy and the second time as a comedy. But to be absolutely precise it is necessary to state that Engels has given the immediate initiation and inspiration for comparing the facts of the years 1848-51 with farce or comedy in his letter of the 3rd of Decem- ber, 1851, where the whole passage is quoted, with which Marx was to begin Eighteenth Brumaire. It is completely clear from the letter that the idea and formulation came from Engels.15 Marx developed this idea and gave it brilliant literary form. Does this mean, perhaps, that Marx's conception of particular events as tragi-comedy or farce, or his idea of world as a stage are the substance of his entire conception of history and man? It would be, as I see it, a simplification to reduce Marx's com- plete materialist conception of history to this definite aspect of a potential conception of the history of mankind. But it is in- dubitable that Marx really sees history up to a certain point in this way and - this arises out of his whole work - the idea of history as the stage is a component of his whole conception of history and man, whom he sees as the unconscious author of his own history. But the idea of world and history as a stage is only one part, a determinate part, of Marx's conception. We could say it is a particular, partial model, that enables one to catch some substantial features of human history and man's action in history. The idea of the world as the stage and of men as the actors affords a number of opportunities for further thought, which the conception of history as the work of prominent individuals, having the privilege of historical initiative, does not. Nor does the conception of history as a process, where the people are the instruments of external, dehumanized and hypostatized ab- stract forces. It should be emphasized that history is the people's activity, their actions, processes and results of actions. With this is K. Marx and F. Engels, Briefwechsel, I. Band, s. 354.</page><page sequence="27">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 555 another meaning is closely connected, which this conception has or may have. Plays can stress historical elements, elements of the fight, struggle, risk, defeat, gambling, uncertainty. The concep- tion of the world as a stage or as a performance has other aspects, too, which probably pressed Marx to accept the particular his- torical epoch as analogical to the performance, tragi-comedy or farce. It comes to this, that Marx wanted to emphasize that comedies, farces and grotesques occurred in the period of false human history. Where the people do not know the right motives of their actions, where they do not manage their own lives consciously, history appears as a process enforcing upon the people the most various attitudes, roles and tasks, which are not the results of their choices, selections and resolutions. Basically history appears to the people like the completing of definite tasks, given from without in advance, or like prescribed roles and actions. The course of events of the real historical process with the lines of the performance, tragedy or comedy is accompanied, too, by the subjective imagination of the historical process' participants, who often presume it is really not the matter of a historical process but of a play. Their conception of their own participation in history as that of acting a part are also a part of reality. Quite the contrary, they impress the very features of the performance upon this reality. Thus there are two aspects of the world con- ception as a stage: a scene where the parts are acted, and where the participants presume or persuade themselves to be this or that, that they are really completing and presenting particular roles and acts. History suggests the stage with many features; it is tragic, similar to comedy, farce, or it has the lines of tragi- comedy and besides, the people themselves think they must or should act. They obscure, deceive, double-cross themselves and others, presume to be this or that, put on masks they can hide behind, suppressing their feelings or pretending. In short the peo- ple can, in the frame of a certain historical tragedy, take their own</page><page sequence="28">556 SOCIAL RESEARCH personal farce or comedy for the comedy of history, or on the contrary, their own personal tragedy for the tragedy of history. Marx applies both these views to the analysis of the revolu- tionary events of the years 1848-51 in France. He demonstrates that those events had their model in the first French Revolution, and that compared with it, they are a parody, a satire, a farce. Marx draws a parallel, analyzing Louis Napoleon and judging him as the little nephew of the great uncle, and shows the ridiculousness and grotesqueness of that figure in comparison with the great Napoleon. He endeavors simultaneously to grasp the parts of the processes by which the classes and fighting groups, and the individuals representative of the classes, deceive themselves, what they represent and what they are in the particular historic epoch. Marx, criticizing Louis Napoleon, differentiates between what this little nephew of the great uncle was thinking of himself, what he made himself believe, how he would like to have acted, and the role he really, objectively had played, what genuine masks had covered his role and what had been illusion and self-deceit. He also examines in the same context the possibility that an individual may be able to consider his ideas, illusions and self- deceits as a part of history, or as a part of real history, and the very chance to assert himself, his average, grotesque and meaning- less personality in history, as something historical and historically prominent. Even today it is appropriate to examine this aspect of Marx's approach. It is important to throw light upon how an irrelevant, average and even funny personality may become an historical factor, how it is possible that a personal, individual manner, accidental features and qualities begin to have influence and significance in a specific historical epoch, and how a personage without authority happens to become a personality of power, and thus historical. When is it possible that little personalities come to the stage, the great ones having left it? For example, how is it possible that some American presidents, as Marx noticed, owe their function to their significance and others, quite the contrary,</page><page sequence="29">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 557 to their insignificance? Why does it happen that some people are prominent just because formerly they had meant very little or nothing? Two extreme approaches appear usually when one examines the historical mission of a man who played some important role in history, for which his personal ability, talent and qualities were not adequate. The definite historical personality (more precisely the person) may have been prominent, acted the im- portant role of the hangman, despot or tyrant in history because circumstances enabled him to do so. He is reduced to the con- ditions, the circumstances, he is a fatal product of history and the chain of events. The other extreme exaggerates the supposed per- sonality, ascribes to him the excellent faculties of fallacy, deceit, intrigue, the ingenious ability to impress his egoistic, megalo- maniac scheme upon conditions and circumstances. The task and role of such a person appear usually as something wonderful or mystic. The circumstances are reduced to nil, in this conception, and the initiative of a certain individual, his faculties for maneu- vering, trickery and exploitation of the circumstances are exag- gerated. In fact it is always, as usual, the question of the conditions' and circumstances' coincidence, of a definite social action com- bined with an action of a particular individual. But the circum- stances are not all-powerful, and the individuals, so far as they are active publicly, are not powerless. Yet not even the definite person is omnipotent, although he may become all-powerful later, and the conditions or circumstances are not an easily con- trolled area for the actions of such a person. It is a problem of two different processes, mutually independent and indifferent up to a definite time, meeting. It is the matter of how a process develops, when a certain ridiculous personality happens to become the hero of a certain period of history and gains the might, influence and importance which are not related to his ability and personal qualities. Why did previous adversaries, more able, better educated, lose the fight against the less able,</page><page sequence="30">558 SOCIAL RESEARCH the average? Does not an average, almost incompetent creature win also because nobody can imagine in advance that he might be dangerous? What did such a person contribute, what was the performance necessary to assert himself? Is it not also a question of chance in contemporary history, that an average individual may claim a part which is not equal to his capacity? The experiences of history of the previous centuries and of the twentieth century, too, demonstrate - and this is not the question of Louis Napoleon only, but of the role and significance of Hitler and other politicians of this century - that little and average people come very often to the stage of history and act a part there which is not appropriate to their qualities, abilities and individual efficiency. Historical circumstances certainly enable the rise of these people. Simultaneously the definite personality that has climbed up must always have some qualities, some faculties, and some efficiency, not adequate to his role, but still such that he can exploit the conditions and circumstances for seizing power, enabling him to act a prominent role and become a factor in history. It was his "10th of December Society" with Louis Napoleon, and Hitler's activity in the Nazi party, much of which was his own work. There had been also accidental characters of personality on the one hand and favorable circumstances and conditions on the other hand. It was just an unique chance that a certain Louis had been a nephew of the great Napoleon; he could have died of common causes as a baby or a boy. The par- ticipants of a certain historical period must voluntarily, because of mistakes or stupidity, or partly through pressure, be willing to resign their own powers, independence, activity or participation and allow a certain ridiculous and average personality to claim social power, the strength of the collective, society, and classes, and to dispose of it as of his own force, inseparable from himself. Only in the coincidence of all these circumstances - objective conditions, a definite state of participants, a particular historical period, a class society also with the definite relation of conflicting class interests and of a definite, however average personality and</page><page sequence="31">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 559 his subjective activity, only in such coincidence and at a specific historic moment could it happen that this person becomes historically necessary, acts a certain role and represents certain forces, that have a historic importance in consequence, and it thus becomes impossible to erase him from history. This coincidence of conditions and circumstances, relations of powers and of the activity of a particular person, and his personal qualities and the historical incidentality, is exceptional and unrepeatable. In correlating the events in France in the years 1848-51 with Louis Napoleon's role Marx raised all these questions and endeavored to solve them. He used for the occasion the met- aphors, terms and analogies of the stage, he used the categories of masks and roles. His approach is naturally not identical with the conception of roles that is customary today in Western sociology and social psychology. But it is the anticipation of these ideas and criticism, which are operating at the present time against the uniform reduction of man to a social role complex, against the efforts to identify the personality with the complex of social roles which the individual executes and acts out. The category of social role can have evidently other meanings; it can itself act a particular part, solving a number of the questions touching the position of man in contemporary society and clarifying the role of the person in society. It can be important to solve edu- cational problems, to create the explicit habits, disciplines and self-control which are necessary for the acceptance of man within a definite system of norms, for his adaptation in the explicit social and cultural sphere. But it is definitely out of the question to accept these aspects of role theory which neglect the question of the individual man's reduction to a complex of roles, where a program is given to deprive man of all independence, activity, creative power in order to aim at active accommodation and conformity. And one still greater problem exists: the demand that man learn perfectly to act the parts which are ascribed to him, destined and</page><page sequence="32">560 SOCIAL RESEARCH expected of him should not signify the disappearance of the real problem of being able to act inadequate roles, not corresponding to the ability and activity of the particular individual. Where a certain individual is acting a part which is not appropriate to him, he is claiming too much and usurping the alienated social powers of others, or is disposing of them. Each alienation in- dicates inadequate appropriation and at the same time also the depriving and impoverishing of somebody else. In a world where man is a complex of roles only, where it is possible to act a role inadequately, there still exists the differentiation of the society into the common average, civilized individuals, who are conform- ing themselves and should be conformed, and the great public actors, historical persons, who are the personalities allowed to dispose of other people's social powers, those which belong to average, common individuals. An elemental tendency exists in such a society to evade the pressure of convention, the con- formism, the stylization, and also the supremacy of the official roles, in the effort to apply the special and individual. The personal takes private shelter, looks for various escapes and spheres where it is possible to operate at least a little naturally, authentically and distinctively. It is interesting that Marx touched this question in the later years in the context of the question of Englishmen's originality and individuality, and that, long before most theoreticians had started to examine the influence of distribution of labor, of the press, and of public opinion on the creation of the individual. Marx writes about this: "To the continentals, originality or individuality are the features of the insular John Bull. By and large this image confuses the Englishman of the past with the Englishman of today. The rapid growth of classes, the excep- tionally advanced division of labor and so-called 'public opinion' in the hands of the Brahmans of the press have, on the contrary, produced a monotony of character in which Shakespeare, for example, would not recognize his countrymen. The differences do not belong to individuals, but to their 'professions' and classes.</page><page sequence="33">ROLES, MASKS AND CHARACTERS 561 Apart from their professions, in everyday life, one 'respectable' Englishman is so like another that even Leibnitz would find it difficult to discover any difference, any differentia specified among them. Banned from all political and social spheres, the highly esteemed individuality has found its last refuge in the whims and vagaries of private life, where it asserts itself from time to time sans gene and with unconscious humour. And it is primarily in the law courts - these great public arenas where the whims of private life encounter one another - that Englishmen still appear as beings sui generis.11 16 These words, written in the year 1862, are the complement of the conception of alienation and reification of human relations and the personification of things, which Marx had started to work on in the 'fifties and which are contained in Capital, Grundrisse and Theory of Surplus Value. The origins of this total concep- tion of alienation and reification of people and personification of things which achieve social qualities and characters in the partic- ular context, are found in earlier works. An excellent work on the term role in social psychology has been published by a French author, Anne-Marie Rocheblave- Spenl6 (La notion de role en psychologie sociale).11 It is a reli- able, solid work about history and the importance of the term role in philosophy, sociology and social psychology. Especially valuable are the parts on the creation and elaboration of this term and of the affinate terms, including the problematics of masks. Many excellent predecessors, like Durkheim, Nietzsche and Bergson, and the developers of these conceptions, like G. H. Mead, R. Linton and others, are mentioned here. But there is no reference to Marx. It is not for the first time and certainly not for the last, that Marx has anticipated and emphasized the problems which philosophy, sociology or art have attacked many decades later. It is not for the first time that his significance and contribution 16 K. Marx and F.

But it remains the historical fact that Marx was one of the first who mentioned this problematics in the last century, and therefore he belongs for good reasons to the predecessors of those contemporary philosophers and sociolo- gists who represent the humanist and critical line in the concep- tion of the idea of role and character masks.</page></plain_text>
