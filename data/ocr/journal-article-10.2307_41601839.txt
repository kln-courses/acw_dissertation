<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction THOMAS LAMARRE RADICAL PERSPECTIVflLISM Lines of Sight sounds a call for radical perspectivalism. It calls forgetting to the root of perspective and aims for a transfiguration of the values associated with a regime initially articulated by René Descartes in the registers of one-point perspective, coordinate geometry, and rationalist dualism. It may seem odd to make so much fuss about a mode or system dating from the seventeenth century. After all, subsequent developments in science and mathematics may be said to have surpassed Cartesian geometry and perspective, or at least to have shown their restrictions and limitations. The Cartesian paradigm may thus appear outdated today, easily relegated to a transitional role within clas- sical or early modern sciences, or to the status of a precursor, an incomplete articulation outstripped by modern and contemporary forms of knowledge. But Lines of Sight is not first and foremost concerned with the bare mate- riality or scientific accuracy of Cartesian geometry or one-point perspective. Rather it is concerned with Cartesianism. As Martin Jay reminds us in the context of visual culture, Cartesianism is not simply a structurally determined outcome of the use of one-point perspective or coordinate geometry. It is the combination of this mathematical mode with "Cartesian ideas of subjective rationality in philosophy" that served to make Cartesianism appear to be "the dominant, and even totally hegemonic, visual model of the modern era/'1 In other words, Cartesianism is a historically articulated mode of rationalism, implying a highly specific field of rationality. Central to Cartesian rationality Ù3</page><page sequence="2">is the establishment of a series of conceptual and practical divides - between space and time, between body and mind, between object and subject. These divides became so entrenched and so identified with Enlightenment thought and rational thinking that modern Western thought is still frequently charac- terized in terms of such unrelenting dualism with its corresponding sense of a subjective mastery over nature implicit in certain modes of visual ordering, scaling, and mapping. The problem, however, is not only that Cartesianism has dominated con- ceptualizations of modernity, providing the hegemonic model. But also, as a systematic attempt to ground various forms of inquiry, Cartesianism has shaped the ways in which we make connections across different disciplines or domains of knowledge - aesthetics, mathematics, history, biology, ethnogra- phy, physics, and philosophy. Nonetheless, while this collection of essays on Japanese media and popular culture proposes to go to the root of perspective and thus to overturn key aspects of Cartesianism, its goal is not, for instance, to denounce one-point perspective as inherently or deterministically fated to produce a hegemonic regime of modernity. Instead, the aim is to get to the root of this received regime of perspective in order to explore other modes and practices, other potentialities of perspective, which may have radical im- plications for determining what counts as art, or what makes for identity, and how we work across disciplines today. Indeed, as the use of the term "radical perspectivalism" indicates, Lines of Sight does not dispense with perspective. It is concerned with the radical potentiality of perspective, and not only in the field of vision. The emphasis on sight in the title is a lure or point of departure, designed to attract and activate a broader engagement with questions pertain- ing to aesthetics and to multisensory operations across fields of inquiry. As such, even as it aims to uproot and overturn Cartesianism, Lines of Sight makes no claims to supersede or overcome it. This is not because we feel that Cartesianism plays such a deterministic role in modernity that it can never be overcome but only incessantly displaced or deconstructed. Rather the problem for us is that Japan has so often been situated outside West- ern modernity, as a site of overcoming Western modernity, that is, Cartesian dualism - yet such a gesture merely reinscribes and reinforces Cartesian dual- ism in a geopolitical register, usually in the form of an opposition between the spirituality and nondualism of the "Orient" or "Asia" versus the materiality and dualism of the West. The effect, if not the intent, of such a gesture is to shore up a divide between Japan and the West in order to consolidate their identities. Take, for instance, a recent essay by Ian Hacking, a prominent historian X THOMAS LAMARRE</page><page sequence="3">of science. Although his insightful account of Cartesian vision affords a useful point of departure for a critique of Cartesianism in Japan, he goes to great lengths to situate Japan outside his vision of modernity: "The Japanese had the good or ill fortune never to have a Descartes to form centuries of their culture. Indeed there are excellent Cartesian scholars in Japan, but the phi- losopher had no effect on the civilization. Thus the first part of my title, 'The Cartesian vision fulfilled/ is about a curiously Western vision of who we are."2 Although he presents this vision as "curiously" Western, there is, in fact, nothing unusual about this gesture. It is familiar self/other dialectics, in which self-identity is established by projecting difference onto the other. It is only by fixing the otherness of Japan that Hacking arrives at his Western vision of who he is. Significantly, his point of reference is Tezuka Osamu and manga. Hacking argues that Japanese manga never presents weird sex or cruelty in its exploration of human-machine relations - weird sex and cruelty appear in Western imitations of manga. This is Hackings way of arguing that Japan integrates machines or robots into human society rather than anxiously objec- tifying them as Westerners do. The problem with such an approach is that, on the one hand, it generalizes from a handful of examples drawn from Tezuka, ignoring the genuine diversity of ways of dealing with human-machine rela- tions in manga and Japan. On the other hand, it is clear that homogenizing and flattening Japanese society and popular culture is primarily designed to justify speaking, yet again, of a self-identical West. While Hacking to some extent "provincializes" the West's Cartesian vision, he ultimately erases the historical depth of Japanese engagements not only with Descartes and one- point perspective but also with Cartesianism. Yet Hacking s desire to localize the divide between "analogue bodies and digital minds" as a Western vision is shattered by Livia Monnet s essay on Oshii Mamorus Innocence in this volume, which carefully traces the animated film s evocations of Enlightenment conceptualizations of the mind/body problematic, showing precisely how the digital acerbates the divide. Similarly, Timon Screech's contribution reminds us of the centuries-old experimenta- tion with one-point perspective in Japan. We might also consider the forma- tive role of the philosophy of Nishida Kitarõ in Japanese modernity. Nishida did not reject Descartes s philosophy but carefully worked through and incor- porates some of its basic tenets even as Nishida engaged a philosophy of pure experience.3 Indeed, while Nishida strived for nondualism, his geopolitical situation forced an awareness of the paradox of modern nondualism: if non- dualism is compared and contrasted with dualism, is it not merely another mode of dualism? INTRODUCTION xl</page><page sequence="4">In recent years, beginning with Murakami Takashis first superflat exhibi- tion and catalog in 2000, theories of superflat art have reopened questions about Cartesianism in manga, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture.4 Such theories overlap with our concerns but embody an ambivalence that we do not share. On the one hand, superflat links Cartesian perspective to Western modernity in a deterministic manner, in an attempt to situate Japan outside modernity. On the other hand, even as superflat makes a linear connection between Edo art and contemporary manga and anime, it is clear that Cartesianism does not merely provide a point of reference for superflat; it refuses to go away. Thus the superflat results in heightened ambivalence, because Cartesianism (or modernity) is not, in fact, outside its self/other dia- lectics but central to it. It is precisely to grapple with such concerns that Lines of Sight does not provincialize Cartesianism or otherwise propose to overcome it, but instead strives to overturn it from within by attending to the potentiality of per- spective, as radical perspectivalism. In fact, it is important to note that the mechanism for producing self-identity, both in superflat theory and in Hack- ing's essay, is, in effect, Cartesian. Although I first described this gesture in terms of a self/other dialectics, which sounds of Hegelian overtones, the ultimate effect is more Cartesian than Hegelian because its aim is not to ex- plore the movement of historical emergence and interaction but to map out and police the boundaries between self and other. Ironically, such efforts to place Japan outside Cartesian modernity wind up producing a thoroughly static geopolitical map of identities, merely applying the model of coordinate geometry to cultural formations. It is precisely such old-fashioned and self- serving gestures that Lines of Sight proposes to overturn, proceeding along four lines of inquiry. The first group of essays advances the critique of Cartesianism as it has entered film and media studies. One current of film theory, popular in the 1960s and 1970s, argued that the monocular properties of the lens had encouraged cinema to adopt a mode of Cartesianism: the viewer assumed a position of subjective mastery over a world that had been objectified by the application of Cartesian ordering implicit in the camera lens. The argument inspired a series of responses, and while an exclusive emphasis on the lens was largely dismissed as a form of technological determinism, the broader lines of the argument proved compatible with other strands of film and semi- otic theory taking issue with the establishment of closed, self-contained, or seamlessly "sutured" worlds in literature, cinema, and other arts - a sort of "illusionary realism" that was seen as an application of Cartesian principles XÜ THOMAS LAMARRE</page><page sequence="5">of subjectivity.5 Simply put, the world on the screen, on the page, or on some other surface appeared to exist as a seamless objective whole independent of the viewer, affording an imaginary voyage into that world, while sustain- ing the viewers sense of self-integrity, privacy, and supremacy. A variety of approaches has arisen for investigating how image-worlds or story-worlds negotiate the relation between subject and object in order to fuel the viewer s illusions of mastery and self-identity. What has proved persistent and power- ful, however, is the basic critique of self-contained story- and image-worlds, which is at heart a critique of Cartesian dualism. Such a critique tends to advance along two fronts. On the one hand, there is a search for gaps and ruptures in the apparently seamless world, calling at- tention to aesthetic operations that run counter to or disrupt narrative opera- tions and conventions. Thus Marc Steinbergs essay focuses on various gaps or intervals within animation, drawing particular attention to how the gap between 2-D and 3-D imagery affords a way to disrupt homogeneity in ani- mation, and arriving at a "fascinating spectacle of layers and textures" whose critical force lies in its power to forestall the construction of smoothly com- posited, self-contained worlds. Similarly, in her meticulous excavation of two characteristic features of shõjo manga (star-filled eyes and layouts in which a girls body stretches across the page), Fujimoto Yukari calls attention to how such features break with regular, static, even rigid forms of layout. She shows how such rigid layouts became associated with story manga, and eventually, with goal-oriented action in shõnen manga. In effect, starry eyes and non- regular layouts do not merely break the rectilinear gridding of the page but, more importantly, reject a form of compositional closure in which regularity of spatialization implies a mode of causality in which subjects achieve mastery over objects through their actions. On the other hand, resistance to illusionary realism may take the form of an insistence on the activity of viewers in the production of the story- or image-world. In other words, rather than a closed and self-contained world for the disembodied subject to explore and master, the viewer becomes a pro- ducer, an actor, an interactor. This is precisely the point of Atsuko Sakaki s account of photography. Rather than condemn the camera for its monocular properties or endorse myths of its veracity, Sakaki highlights the movements of the photographer through the streets. The result is a mobile perspectiv- alism that does not impose order and closure upon images (a fixed unitary viewing position) but instead allows the photographer to "take his body with him." Significantly, Sakaki finds in this meandering perspectivalism a chal- lenge to cinematic narrative - which is to say, not only the imposition of a INTRODUCTION XUI</page><page sequence="6">unitary and static viewing position but also the conventions of a goal-oriented cause-and-effect action. Finally, in her presentation of kamishibai, Sharalyn Orbaugh weaves deftly between these two ways of challenging the illusionary realism of Cartesianism, stressing the importance of the interval between panels and of performance, and underscoring the role of the audience in the production of meaning - even in the context of wartime propaganda, in which performances were calculated to place limits on the production of meaning in order to dictate a worldview. Orbaughs essay thus arrives at a challenge, raising questions about how we gauge the impact of non-Cartesian modalities. Rather than dwell on resistance to rationality, should we not be attentive to the emergence of other "appara- tuses of power" or other "fields of rationality," which only appear to us irratio- nal and disruptive because Cartesianism itself has so thoroughly constrained our conceptualization of reason and coordination? This question - about the relation between non-Cartesian modalities and power formations - returns us to the geopolitical issues mentioned above but in a different register, for now we are less likely to assume a tidy correspon- dence between a nation or national culture (Japan) and the non-Cartesian. It thus prepares for the second inquiry into perspective - that of the relation between perspective and worlds. Cartesianism has historically encouraged us to think in terms of a fixed and unitary viewing position (as established by one-point or geometric perspective) and by extension to assume a one-to-one correspondence between a perspective and a world. Yet, while perspective may indeed have world-making potential, an actual world entails a composition of perspectives, a relation or set of relations between perspectives, and can only be prolonged by somehow opening or harnessing that potentiality. Through a series of shifting views on Hokusai, for instance, Timon Screech makes two points. First, while the art and name of Hokusai clearly stabilizes something, and something Japanese at that, this is not Japan in isolation from or opposi- tion to a putative West. Instead, it is a Japan in the world, that is, of the globe or planet. Second, conversely, insofar as Hokusais art includes more than one perspective (and, in fact, more than one kind of perspective), it composes a world. If Fuji is now a "world mountain" in Screechs account, it is because there is a world in Japan. These points are important to keep in mind in reading the subsequent two essays working through the legacy of superflat theory, because, as we have seen, superflat begins with a binary self/other model assuming a strict divide between Japan and the West from the outset. Waiyee Loh grapples with this self/other binarism in the context of the Goth manga Kuroshitsuji Xiv THOMAS LAMARRE</page><page sequence="7">or Black Butler ; examining its idealization of a Western European past, which she styles as a non- Japanese past. The essay thus directly confronts the risk of homogenizing Japanese history, of eliminating allegedly foreign elements and then arbitrarily identifying the remaining elements as Japanese. (After all, one might well argue that the Gothic, as an invented tradition, is as Japa- nese as state-sponsored Shinto religion.) Ultimately, however, Loh turns the tables, arguing that the idealization of Europeanness in Black Butler tends to "celebrate a dehistoricized 'Japanese' form of (post)modernity in the pres- ent," which can be countered by attending to localized readings of it. In a similar vein, David Beynoun explores techno-cute architectures in Thailand, addressing the "Asian values" associated with robot anthropomorphism. Yet he finds that these architectural gestures toward Asian values, redolent of pan-Asianism, prove historically flat - a matter of affluence and global capi- tal in the region rather than deeper values or something held in common. In these essays, the question of "other Asias," succinctly posed by Gayatri Spivak, takes on new urgency, as a matter of how we situate the world in Asia and Asia in the world, particularly in the context of a global urban world comprising manga and superflat design. The question of "worlds in perspective" literally takes on new depth in Reginald Jacksons essay on The Tale ofGenji picture scrolls. Disenchanted with the aesthetic flattening of these scrolls in a recent exhibition, Jackson offers a meticulous archaeological counterrestoration of them, moving beyond a bi- nary divide between the 2-D and the 3-D to unearth other formations of depth that do not correspond to or map onto Cartesianism or anti-Cartesianism. Instead, he discovers a nondiegetic perspectivalism, which he contrasts to "il- lusionism" or illusionary realism. Cumulatively, the essays in this unit remind us that it is not simply a matter of liking or disliking flatness, or condemning or embracing depth, or pitting one world against another; what matters are the negotiations of depth, the relations arising from the potentiality of per- spective, that is, worlds in perspective. One of the other hallmarks of Cartesianism is the fixing of the position of the observer. An image constructed in accordance with one-point perspec- tive, for instance, implies an ideal viewing position, looking directly at the image from a frontal position toward the vanishing point; from this position, everything appears duly ordered, scaled, and proportioned. In addition, coor- dinate geometry implies that a position can be established and located upon a grid, either two- or three-dimensional, by an observer standing outside it. If we try to situate the ideal viewing position - which Hubert Damisch in his seminal study describes as "a point of view outside nature from which we INTRODUCTION XV</page><page sequence="8">might contemplate it unimpeded, all its mystery cleared away, with a single dominating gaze"6 - within nature, that is, upon the coordinate grid, then we arrive at an impasse: we find the human at the center of a disciplinary paradigm - the human as both object and subject, as shaped by history and culture, and shaping history and culture. Kant, as Damisch points out, "established a point of orientation within the subject itself" in an attempt to reconcile these tendencies. Yet, as Craig Jack- son s essay demonstrates, the paradox persists, not only conceptually or philo- sophically but also in media worlds. Using mathematics to open some new perspectives on these media, Jackson points out that Pacmans view within his video game world "would not open onto limitless space," rather "he would look off into the distance and see . . . himself." When one tries to map the seeing of seeing, another dimension suddenly comes into play, in a manner that feels distinctively non- Cartesian, with the viewing position folding back on itself. Moreover, as Jackson shows in the context of Lain , attempts to fix the position of the self will result in a multiplication of nonlocalizable selves. This multiplication of nonlocalized selves encountering one another is the very essence of radical perspectivalism, and it implies a crisis in identity, which today is commonly associated with the digital and new media. Jinying Li s essay follows directly from Lain s identity crisis, showing how superflat commercialism ultimately tends to flatten the mobility and multiplicity as- sociated with digital media: the "windows" that "still invite us to imagine a space beyond them" are "completely blocked and flattened into a wall/" Li s discussion shows us that the classic perspectivism of Cartesianism is still very much alive. Recall that classic perspectivism guaranteed "the possibility of switching from one point of view to another" by forcing their ultimate con- vergence by recourse to God, and it was Nietzsche who first protested in the name of radical perspectivalism, in the name of "different points of view that are anything but complementary, each manifesting a divergence."7 Indeed, if Lain also articulates a problem with God, it is precisely because it strives to know whether (and how) the multiplication of nonlocalized selves might truly arrive at divergence in an era stretched between commercialized browsing and disciplinary education. As such, the question of Cartesianism is no longer merely that of fixed positions and locatable selves but of whether the multiplication of nonlocal- ized selves can diverge and thereby introduce new articulations of autonomy, liberty, and identity, which would not be grounded in the mode of conver- gence known as self-identical individualism. In her account of transgender transition in Öshima Yumikos Tsuruhara-tsuruhara, Emily Somers shows how Xvl THOMAS LAMARRE</page><page sequence="9">this manga resists the forces of convergence implied in psychologism and medicalization - both of which impose, we might say, gods of individualist sovereignty - turning instead to reincarnation for a source of deeper mate- rial processes to articulate genuine divergence without sacrificing autonomy. And in Somerss take on reincarnation, we also find suggestions for rethink- ing a fourth aspect of Cartesianism taken up in this volume - the profound dynamism of matter. In Cartesianism, matter is treated as pure extensity in space, as just so much inert stuff out there, and if it moves, it is only when forces act upon it. Such an approach to matter works well enough in the domain of classical me- chanics, that is, when one is dealing with idealized schematics of action and reaction, with situations reduced to simple paradigms of cause and effect. In other words, Cartesianism also implies a dualism of matter and energy that parallels that of body and consciousness, and object and subject, in which the "energetics" of matter becomes unthinkable. If such an approach persists, it is partly because Cartesian dualism also reinforces a version of substantialism inherited from Aristotle, in which even qualities are appended to objects, at- tributes predicated on substances, and in which form comes to matter from without. Yet, despite a range of cogent alternatives from the domains of psy- chology, phenomenology, cognitive sciences, and radical empiricism, human- istic studies remain strangely indebted to Cartesian modes grounded on the notion of dead, passive, inert matter. Our fourth series of essays contests this brand of Cartesianism, explor- ing the energetics of matter in the context of media. Yuriko Furuhata delves into this question in an encounter between film and manga, in the context of Õshima Nagisa s film of Shirato Sanpei s Ninja bugeichõ. Initially, Furuhatas use of the terms "mediation" and "remediation" may appear to assume an inertness of matter insofar as the two terms - film and manga - seem to exist prior to their relation, and their encounter is described as a negation. Yet, even though film appears poised to negate the material qualities of manga, Furuhata finds in Õshimas film modes of doubling that force a reckoning with the nonsynchronous simultaneity of the two media, akin to what Walter Ben- jamin called the dialectical image. In her analysis of the same film and manga, Miryam Sas evokes Walter Benjamin and his impact on student movements and revolutionary violence in Japan, to call attention to forms of historical violence that cannot not be mapped, spatialized, predicted, or otherwise con- tained. No sooner is historical violence located than it multiplies - the hero Kagemaru, once slain, crops up everywhere - becoming pure violence, salva- tion s violence, bloodless violence. Finally, in Oshii Mamoru s Innocence , Livia INTRODUCTION XVÌÌ</page><page sequence="10">Monnet deftly traces the different registers in which digitization fails to live up to its promise of liberating matter from form, thus failing to allow for genuinely multitudinous transformations. Multiplicity is folded back, that is, twisted or perverted, onto the figure of the gynoid, as if in compensation for a crisis in the goal-oriented cause-and-effect action associated with men within illusionary realism (or shõnen action, as in Fujimotos essay). Yet, as Monnet says of the gynoid, the genuine challenge of radical perspectivalism arises when matter has a mind of its own. As matter proves energetic, and even the inorganic has its reasons, we can no longer think in terms of simple causality, mastery of objects, or a one-to- one self-contained correspondence between a viewing position, a self, and a world. We then begin to trace the effects of non-Cartesian modalities, seeking in a radicalization of perspective the potential for an aesthetic and political transfiguration of this world. Notes 1.
